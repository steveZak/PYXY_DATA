        "wiki": "D\u00fcsseldorf (often Dusseldorf in English sources; UK: , US: , German: [\u02c8d\u028fsl\u0329d\u0254\u0281f] (listen);  Low Franconian and Ripuarian: D\u00fcsseld\u00f6rp ([\u02c8d\u028fsl\u0329d\u0153\u0250\u032fp]); archaic Dutch: Dusseldorp) is the capital and second-largest city of the most populous German state of North Rhine-Westphalia after Cologne, and the seventh-largest city in Germany, with a population of 617,280. At the confluence of the Rhine and its tributary D\u00fcssel, the city lies in the centre of both the Rhine-Ruhr and the Rhineland Metropolitan Regions with the Cologne Bonn Region to its south and the Ruhr to its north. Most of the city lies on the right bank of the Rhine (as opposed to Cologne, whose city centre lies on the river's left bank). The city is the largest in the German Low Franconian dialect area (closely related to Dutch). \"Dorf\" meaning \"village\" in German, the \"-dorf\" suffix (English cognate: thorp) is unusual in the German-speaking area for a settlement of D\u00fcsseldorf's size.\nMercer's 2012 Quality of Living survey ranked D\u00fcsseldorf the sixth most livable city in the world. D\u00fcsseldorf Airport is Germany's third-busiest airport after those of Frankfurt and Munich, serving as the most important international airport for the inhabitants of the densely populated Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area. D\u00fcsseldorf is an international business and financial centre, renowned for its fashion and trade fairs, and is headquarters to one Fortune Global 500 and two DAX companies. Messe D\u00fcsseldorf organises nearly one fifth of premier trade shows. As second largest city of the Rhineland, D\u00fcsseldorf holds Rhenish Carnival celebrations every year in February/March, the D\u00fcsseldorf carnival celebrations being the third most popular in Germany after those held in Cologne and Mainz.There are 22 institutions of higher education in the city including the Heinrich-Heine-Universit\u00e4t D\u00fcsseldorf, the university of applied sciences (Hochschule D\u00fcsseldorf), the academy of arts (Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf) (Joseph Beuys, Emanuel Leutze, August Macke, Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, and Andreas Gursky), and the university of music (Robert-Schumann-Musikhochschule D\u00fcsseldorf). The city is also known for its pioneering influence on electronic/experimental music (Kraftwerk) and its Japanese community.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early development ===\nWhen the Roman Empire was strengthening its position throughout Europe, a few Germanic tribes clung on in marshy territory off the eastern banks of the Rhine. In the 7th and 8th centuries, the odd farming or fishing settlement could be found at the point where the small river D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine. It was from such settlements that the city of D\u00fcsseldorf grew.\n\nThe first written mention of D\u00fcsseldorf (then called Dusseldorp in the local Low Rhenish dialect) dates back to 1135. Under Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa the small town of Kaiserswerth to the north of D\u00fcsseldorf became a well-fortified outpost, where soldiers kept a watchful eye on every movement on the Rhine. Kaiserswerth eventually became a suburb of D\u00fcsseldorf in 1929. In 1186, D\u00fcsseldorf came under the rule of the Counts of Berg. 14 August 1288 is one of the most important dates in the history of D\u00fcsseldorf. On this day the sovereign Count Adolf VIII of Berg granted the village on the banks of the D\u00fcssel town privileges. Before this, a bloody struggle for power had taken place between the Archbishop of Cologne and the count of Berg, culminating in the Battle of Worringen.\n\nThe Archbishop of Cologne's forces were wiped out by the forces of the count of Berg who were supported by citizens and farmers of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf, paving the way for D\u00fcsseldorf's elevation to city status, which is commemorated today by a monument on the Burgplatz. The custom of turning cartwheels is credited to the children of D\u00fcsseldorf. There are variations of the origin of the cartwheeling children. Today the symbol (Der Radschl\u00e4ger) represents the story and every year the D\u00fcsseldorfers celebrate by having a cartwheeling contest. After this battle the relationship between the four cities deteriorated, because they were commercial rivals; it is often said that there is a kind of hostility between the citizens of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf. Today, it finds its expression mainly in a humorous form (especially during the Rhineland Karneval) and in sports.A market square sprang up on the banks of the Rhine and the square was protected by city walls on all four sides. In 1380, the dukes of Berg moved their seat to the town and D\u00fcsseldorf was made regional capital of the Duchy of Berg. During the following centuries several famous landmarks were built, including the Collegiate Church of St Lambertus. In 1609, the ducal line of the United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg died out, and after a virulent struggle over succession, J\u00fclich and Berg fell to the Wittelsbach Counts of Palatinate-Neuburg, who made D\u00fcsseldorf their main domicile, even after they inherited the Electorate of the Palatinate, in 1685, becoming now Prince-electors as Electors Palatine.Under the art-loving Johann Wilhelm II (r. 1690\u20131716), a vast art gallery with a huge selection of paintings and sculptures, were housed in the Stadtschloss (city castle). After his death, the city fell on hard times again, especially after Elector Charles Theodore inherited Bavaria and moved the electoral court to Munich. With him he took the art collection, which became part of what is now the Alte Pinakothek in Munich. Destruction and poverty struck D\u00fcsseldorf after the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon made Berg a Grand Duchy and D\u00fcsseldorf its capital. Johann Devaranne, a leader of Solingen's resistance to Napoleon's conscription decrees, was executed here in 1813. After Napoleon's defeat, the whole Rhineland including Berg was given to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815. The Rhine Province's parliament was established in D\u00fcsseldorf. By the mid-19th century, D\u00fcsseldorf enjoyed a revival thanks to the Industrial Revolution as the city boasted 100,000 inhabitants by 1882; the figure doubled in 1892.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nDuring World War I the Royal Naval Air Service (RNS) undertook the first Entente strategic bombing missions on 22 September 1914, when it bombed the Zeppelin bases in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\nIn 1920, D\u00fcsseldorf became the centre of the General Strike. On 15 April 1920, 45 delegates of the German Miners Union were murdered by the Freikorps.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nThe city was a target of strategic bombing during World War II, particularly during the RAF bombing campaign in 1943 when over 700 bombers were used in a single night. Raids continued late into the war. As part of the campaign against German oil facilities, the RAF raid of 20\u201321 February on the Rhenania Ossag refinery in the Reisholz district of the city halted oil production there. The Allied ground advance into Germany reached D\u00fcsseldorf in mid-April 1945. The United States 97th Infantry Division easily captured the city on 18 April 1945, after the local German Resistance group launched Aktion Rheinland.\n\n\n=== German Federal Republic ===\nIn 1946, D\u00fcsseldorf was made capital of the new federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The city's reconstruction proceeded at a frantic pace and the economic transformation guided D\u00fcsseldorf's economic growth.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Physical geography ===\n\nD\u00fcsseldorf lies at the centre of the Lower Rhine basin, where the delta of the D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine. The city lies on the east side of the Rhine, except District 4 (Oberkassel, Niederkassel, Heerdt and L\u00f6rick).\nAcross the Rhine, the city of Neuss stands on the delta of the Erft. D\u00fcsseldorf lies southwest of the Ruhr urban area, and in the middle of the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region.\nD\u00fcsseldorf is built entirely on alluvium, mud, sand, clay and occasionally gravel. The highest point in D\u00fcsseldorf is the top of Sandberg in the far eastern part of the city (Hubbelrath borough) at 165 metres (541 ft). The lowest point is at the far northern end in Wittlaer borough where the Schwarzbach enters the Rhine, with an average elevation of 28 metres (92 ft).\n\n\n=== Adjacent cities and districts ===\nThe following districts and cities border D\u00fcsseldorf (clockwise starting from the north): the City of Duisburg, the District of Mettmann (Ratingen, Mettmann, Erkrath, Hilden, Langenfeld, and Monheim), and the District of Neuss (Dormagen, Neuss, and Meerbusch).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe city has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb, mild in relation to East Germany).

The wind is calm (defined as being under 2 m/s or 4.5 mph) about 35% of the time, more frequently at night and in the winter.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nWith a population of 612,178 within the city boundaries (31 December 2015), D\u00fcsseldorf is Germany's seventh largest city. Its population surpassed the threshold of 100,000 inhabitants during the height of industrialisation in 1882, and peaked at just over 705,000 in 1962. The city then began to lose residents with many moving into neighbouring municipalities. However, since the late 1990s, the city's population has been slowly rising again.\nA total of 109,883 (18%) of D\u00fcsseldorf's population are foreigners (31 December 2008), the majority of whom come from within Europe (81,742).

Heinrich Heine, whose 200th birthday was celebrated in 1997 and who originally had a proposed memorial in the city dedicated to him; Clara and Robert Schumann; and as Felix Mendelssohn, are the most prominent artists related to the city, which is home to a distinguished Academy of Fine Arts.\nThe D\u00fcsseldorf cultural scene comprises traditional and avant-garde, classical and glamorous. The world-famous state art collection of North Rhine-Westphalia, the highly acclaimed Deutsche Oper am Rhein (opera), and the D\u00fcsseldorfer Schauspielhaus (theatre), artistic home of Gustaf Gr\u00fcndgens, are major elements of D\u00fcsseldorf's reputation as a centre of the fine arts.\n\n\n=== Beer ===\nD\u00fcsseldorf is well known for its Altbier, a hoppy beer which translates as old [style] beer, a reference to the pre-lager brewing method of using a warm top-fermenting yeast like British pale ales. Over time the Alt yeast adjusted to lower temperatures, and the Alt brewers would store or lager the beer after fermentation, leading to a cleaner, crisper beer. The name \"altbier\" first appeared in the 19th century to differentiate the beers of D\u00fcsseldorf from the new pale lager that was gaining a hold on Germany.Brewers in D\u00fcsseldorf used the pale malts that were used for the modern pale lagers, but retained the old (\"alt\") method of using warm fermenting yeasts. The first brewery to use the name Alt was Schumacher which opened in 1838. The founder, Mathias Schumacher, allowed the beer to mature in cool conditions in wooden casks for longer than normal, and laid the foundation for the modern alt \u2013 amber coloured and lagered. The result is a pale beer that has some of the lean dryness of a lager but with fruity notes as well.There are five pub-breweries in D\u00fcsseldorf which brew Altbier on the premises: F\u00fcchschen, Schumacher, Schl\u00fcssel, Uerige and Brauerei K\u00fcrzer. Four of the five are in the historic centre of D\u00fcsseldorf (Altstadt); the other (Schumacher), between the Altstadt and D\u00fcsseldorf Central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), also maintains an establishment in the Altstadt, Im Goldenen Kessel, across the street from Schl\u00fcssel.\nEach (except Brauerei K\u00fcrzer) produces a special, secret, seasonal \"Sticke\" version in small quantities, though the names vary: Schl\u00fcssel spells it \"Stike\", without the \"c\", while Schumacher calls its special beer \"Latzenbier\", meaning \"slat beer\", possibly because the kegs from which it was poured had been stored on raised shelves. F\u00fcchschen's seasonal is its Weihnachtsbier (Christmas beer), available in bottles starting mid-November, and served in the brewpub on Christmas Eve.\n\n\n=== Music and nightlife ===\n\nSince the 1950s the \"Kom(m)\u00f6dchen\" has been one of the most prominent political cabarets of Germany. The city's most famous contribution to the culture of modern popular music is beyond doubt the influential avant-garde electronic band Kraftwerk. Formed by a few D\u00fcsseldorf-born musicians, Kraftwerk is internationally known as the most significant band in the history of post-war German music and as pioneers in electronic music. Other influential musical groups originating from D\u00fcsseldorf include Neu!, formed in 1971 by Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother, after their split from Kraftwerk, and La D\u00fcsseldorf, also formed by Dinger in 1976 shortly after Neu! disbanded. Both groups had a significant influence on a variety of subsequent rock, post-punk, and electronic music artists.Internationally known power metal band Warlock was formed in D\u00fcsseldorf in 1982. Its frontwoman, Doro Pesch, had a successful solo career in Europe and Asia since Warlock ended. The punk band Die Toten Hosen, which is famous around the world, also the most popular singers in Germany Westernhagen and Heino come from D\u00fcsseldorf. The electronic act D.A.F. was formed in the city in 1978, as well as the electronic/industrial pioneers Die Krupps in 1980. Another famous formation is Fehlfarben. Founded in the late 1970s by Peter Hein, Frank Fenstermacher, Kurt Dahlke and Michael Kemner.\nD\u00fcsseldorf appears in several songs, including D\u00fcsseldorf by the British indie band Teleman and W\u00e4rst du doch in D\u00fcsseldorf geblieben by Danish singer Dorthe Kollo.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nD\u00fcsseldorf, Germany is the fashion capital of Germany as it is a major cultural center for the art and fashion scenes. The fashionable clothes trend took root in this city before 1949. 1949 is the date of the first fashion show staged in D\u00fcsseldorf. Fashion trends have occurred as access to more elegant clothing for the general public has been a part of the culture for almost a century. Two times a year an event called the, \u201cVoices of Fashion,\u201d occurs and attracts many people to visit D\u00fcsseldorf to find the latest fashion items. There are famous designers that have made a name for themselves in D\u00fcsseldorf as well. Designers Sabine Schumacher, Peter O. Mahler, and Renate Harvan all design in D\u00fcsseldorf. To keep the creativity and passion for fashion alive in D\u00fcsseldorf everyday there are schools dedicated to fashion design in D\u00fcsseldorf as well. Akademie Mode and Design Institution, Design Department Academy, and Mode Design College are the three prominent fashion schools residing in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n=== Carnival ===\n\nOne of the biggest cultural events in D\u00fcsseldorf is the Karneval (also referred to as the \"fifth season\") which starts every year on 11 November at 11:11 a.m., and reaches its climax on Rosenmontag (Rose Monday), featuring a huge parade through the streets of D\u00fcsseldorf. Karneval ends on Aschermittwoch (Ash Wednesday).\n\n\n=== Cartwheeler of D\u00fcsseldorf ===\n\nThe D\u00fcsseldorfer Radschl\u00e4ger (Boy who does Cartwheels) is said to be the city's oldest tradition. The symbol of the cartwheeler can be found on many souvenirs and various things in D\u00fcsseldorf have the cartwheelers to thank for their names. This tradition was honoured in 1954 by the erection of a fountain, called Cartwheeler's Fountain, on the Burgplatz in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n==== Legends of its origin and history ====\nThe tradition cannot be linked to one specific historical event, instead, there are several stories surrounding the beginnings of the D\u00fcsseldorf Cartwheelers. Probably the most well known version is Battle of Worringen. In the battle of 1288 Count Adolf devastatingly defeated the Archbishop of Cologne. As a consequence of this victory, D\u00fcsseldorf obtained Town privileges. The inhabitants, especially the children ran joyfully on the streets and performed cartwheels.\nAnother story talks about a wedding procession during which one of the wheels of the wedding carriage broke. In order to fend off the threat of bad luck, a boy supposedly jumped to the carriage, took hold of the wheel and thus became a living part of the wheel. Whether the story is about the marriage of Jan Wellem and Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici or the wedding of Margravine Jakobea of Baden and Johann Wilhelm is debatable.\nAnother story gives an account of this wedding between Margrave Jacobe von Baden and Johann Wilhelm, in 1585. According to legend she felt miserable about her marriage, but the cartwheelers who displayed their skills next to her carriage were able to make her smile. Numerous travelers were attracted to the city by great exhibitions \u2013 the forerunner of today's fairs \u2013 between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. During this time the children who did the cart wheeling found out that it was a profitable source of income. The bourgeoisie accepted this in good humour as a symbolic act of local patriotism. In the beginning the lads shouted \"f\u00f6r eene Penning schlage ich das Rad\u201c (cartwheel for a penny). The Jan Wellem monument returned to D\u00fcsseldorf at the end of the Second World War. The procession was accompanied by torches, fanfares and the cartwheeling boys.\n\n\n===== Cartwheelers in the cityscape =====\nCartwheelers can be found by several fountains within the city and near many small landmarks. The most famous is Cartwheeler's Fountain in Burgplatz with an inscription of a quote by Hans M\u00fcller-Schl\u00f6sser: \"Radschl\u00e4ger wolle mer blieve, wie jeck et de Minschen och drieve\u201c (We will always remain cartwheelers, however crazy it drives people.) The fountain was designed by Alfred Zschorsch in 1954 and donated by the  Heimatverein D\u00fcsseldorfer Jonges, which is a club devoted to the maintenance of local and regional traditions. There are other cartwheelers that decorate storm drains and the door knocker on the Church of Lambertus, which was designed by Friedrich Becker. He created the cartwheeler in front of the Schadow Arcades.This tradition has been kept alive by the Alde D\u00fcsseldorfer B\u00fcrgergesellschaft von 1920 e. V., a society founded in 1920, who organized the first cartwheeler competition on 17 October 1937. Since 1971 this event has been held annually in cooperation with the Stadtsparkasse (a local bank), but formerly took place in the K\u00f6nigsallee. Since 2006 it has taken place on the Rheinwerft, near the old part of town. This is a fixed date in the city\u2019s calendar of events. About 500 boys regularly participate in this event and since 1971 girls have also taken part. In 2001 the art project Radschl\u00e4ger-Kunst (Cartwheeler Art) was called into life, in which over 100 cartwheeler sculptures have been designed by various artists. The door knocker on the Church of Lambertus functioned as a model for the sculptures that are 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) high, 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) wide and 30 cm (12 in) deep. They were positioned around the city centre. Some of the sculptures have been auctioned off to companies and private owners.\n\n\n=== Christmas market ===\nEvery Christmas, the city of D\u00fcsseldorf uses the city centre to host one of the largest Christmas gatherings in Germany. The Christmas festival occurs every year from 17 November until 23 December.

          "My husband and I decided to visit here as we seen it from the street and were intrigued as to what it was. We went up to the door and realised it was a restaurant in the sky. The elevator goes from 0 - 1721/2 mtrs in 60 seconds which is unnerving but fun. There is a bar at",
          "What a nice view from the tower to all the Duesseldorf city! A place that most visited There is also nice walking place with bicycle and end of the street there will alot coffee shops",

          "Amazing views over Rhine well worth a visit if in dusselsdorf off the area fun fair near by 9 euros go up to top Japanese restaurant is at top 172 metres up Drinks good prices in bar just below restaurant a must see",
          "The Rhein tower is a must go in Dusseldorf. From 168m above, you see all of DUsseldorf below and it is fascinating.. Do not just stop near the elevator. Take the tour round the restaurant. My tip is to go early at 10 am to benefit from the early bird ticket discount.",
          "Well worth visit. Beautiful views on the city and surrounding area, especially on clear sunny day. Hint: enter before 11am or after 10pm for half price tickets.",
          "This is one of the communication towers of the world and an altitude of 180 Meters from the earth you could see all over the city and as per the guide in clear air and good sunny day you could see even the great cathedral of cologne. also, don't forget to help yourself with a",
          "We went with our 6 months old son. We had to leave our stroller downstairs which means I had to carry my son the whole time upstairs. It costs 9\u20ac just to go up in the bar where you have to pay extra for the binoculars. The view is great but it takes about 5 minutes to look",
          "A magnificent view of the city from the height of the bird's eye. Panoramic view of Dusseldorf! I definitely recommend",
          "A great visit with a great view. All well explained but they could make more of it. I went early and there were very few people there in fact the lift only had 4 people in it!! Walk around and discover Dusseldorf from a different angle. Drinks and eats at the top not too",
          "Enjoyed getting to see the whole city all at once. A bit pricy for a ticket but all of these type of things are aka space needle in Seattle or the sky garden in London. There is a lot of interesting architecture in D\u00fcsseldorf. Plus the Japan day was just starting so we could",
          "In the top of this tower you can find a 360\u00b0 bar with a view over the all city. It's a nice place to start one city trip",
          "I will just have to believe them as my head was in the clouds. I had a feeling when the aircraft was on short finals to land and there was no sight of \u2018terra firma\u2019 that my number one objective would probably be a waste of time and money. It was only \u20ac9 entry so I just had to",
          "A definite to do is the Rhine promenade, which goes along side Carlstadt and the old town. The promenade is a pedestrian area where you can walk, have a drink at one of the outdoor bars or just relax on the grass by the riverside. If you like, you can even take one of the boat",
          "Hi, All! Well, when you are in town, such an experience could be nice, anytime. You will arrive at 168 m high altitude and all the city will be at your feet.",
          "It costs 9 euro to go up to 170 meters. The lift goes up really quickly and has a height meter so that you know how high you are. The views are amazing, and there are signs on the windows telling you which places you are facing. There is a cafe selling coffee, soft drinks and",
          "We had a meal in this exquisit fusion restaiurant at the top of the tower. Booking of the restaurant was very easily done on line. We were there about an hour early and they did not make us wait for a table. We really can't say enough about the meal. It is the best meal I have",
          "Went up this incredible tower the cost of this doesn't matter as what you experience is well worth it we where in D\u00fcsseldorf Germany for a few days as part of a 50th birthday trip for one of our mate's this was one of our things that we wanted to do and boy it didn't disappoint",
          "Had a great time visiting this place on a whim very late on a Friday night we drove over from Holland. The tower looked superb at night. There was free parking and reasonable entrance fee, you can get a superb view of the city from the top and enjoy a beer or two. Really great",
          "A monument which can be seen for Miles. We never walked there this time. A landmark for Dusseldorf. It is quite unique.",
          "It\u2019s nice to be able to look over D\u00fcsseldorf but there isn\u2019t what you\u2019d call a spectacular view by any means. The observation deck has a fairly generic, tourist cafe at the top which didn\u2019t look appealing enough for ya to stop for coffee. I think this could do with a bit of a",

          "My wife and I were looking at this tower which can be seen from any point in Dusseldorf for a couple days before we decided to walk there to have a see. When you are at the ower's base you finally realize how tall and huge it is. It's well worth the price of admission especially",
          "This is a huge tower set on the river bank rising high into the sky and gets you some fantastic photos from below and from a distance. The bulb at the top lights up in blue at night and is worth seeing. However, I did not pay the asking price of 9 euros just to go up it and see",
          "We started our day tour of Dusseldorf here and worked out well because there's a reduced price entry until 11am of only 5 euros per person. Was a cloudy day but still have good views of the city. The restaurant and cafe seemed a bit overpriced but that's normal in these kind of",
          "I went in late afternoon so that I could get some day and night photos. Can see over the city and old town but I think that the modern buildings near the waterfront are more impressive (worth walking to as nearby and get good views back towards the tower). A bit pricey for the",
          "Elevator ride was amazing. 4 meters a second. It wasn\u2019t real clear but nice to check out the promenade & parliament & buildings around it.",
          "Definitely go at dusk, for sunset! You will get spectacular view over D\u00fcsseldorf! Entrance fee is 9 EUR / adult. There\u2019s also a bar & restaurant at the top should you desire to linger a bit longer.",
          "Visiting Cologne and stopped off in Dusseldorf for a day trip. Entry is reasonably priced and they have discount for students. They have a good bar / cafe at the top with cake, donuts, nibbles and nice drinks etc. The view is really great. Worth a visit if you can spare an hour",
          "Absolutely stunning views of the city even though the weather wasn't great. It costs \u20ac9 for an adult but you can stay for as long as you want. There is a nice bar/cafe and we stayed for a couple of hours had a beer and admired the view. It's a lovely relaxing way to see the city",
          "We took a walk down to the Reinturm and even though the weather was poor, the views from tower are outstanding. Buy a beer or a coffee and watch the boats glide by on the river below you. A relaxing and peaceful way to see a D\u00fcsseldorf and the hinterland at your pace. Highly",
          "Wandered in off the street when in Mediahafen to find no queues and a \u20ac9 entry for an eye-popping view of the city and the Rhine. I've been to many viewpoints in many cities and for sheer ease, pleasant environment and value this ranks very highly (though perhaps doesn't quite",
          "It's a great view on a sunny day. The views of the Rhein and all the twists and turns amaze me. It's 9 euro to go up but 5 before 11am or after 10 pm and 7 for under 17 and students/seniors. We went during the christmas holiday and it wasn't too bad. The only negative is",
          "Definitely worth doing but at 9 euros a head it was expensive - shame they don't offer a family discount. The views are incredible with landmarks written on the glass so you know what you are looking at. We visited at night and would go again in the day on our next trip to",
          "The admission price was not about at all for the experience. We each paid \u20ac7 because we got student discount but as adults it\u2019s only \u20ac9 and to go all the way to the top of Rhein Tower and see the views you wouldn\u2019t get anywhere else was phenomenal. It was definitely value for",
          "picked a really clear day and thoroughly enjoyed the experience stayed for seat and a couple of drinks (very reasonable priced) - walked into the harbour area and then back along the river",
          "Well worth going to the top of the Rheinturm. I went on a rainy day and the views were good, if you could select a sunny day it would be brilliant. You get unobstructed 360 degree views and the chance to have a coffee at the top",
          "Was easy to find because it is 168M high. It is right next to the river so when you go up the lift there are excellent views, though was cloudy this time of year. It is well worth a visit. The top has a bar, cafe & sells cakes & snacks, don't think you can get full meals",
          "Beautiful views over dusseldorf. Very smart inside. Got a good deal to include coffee and cake (cake was big portion and very nice) would totally recommend.",
          "The view is spectacular and if you enjoy watching the world go by then grab a coffee and kick back. This is right by the river and the view is perfect. We were there before 11 and saved half the entrance fee.",

          "I like views, especially from a vantage point high up. This is good for getting views around the city and area. However, for what you get, which is basically an enclosed platform at 168 metres in the air with bar and bar snacks extra, I think the price is a little high. If",
          "Lovely 360 degree view, but felt that \u20ac9 per person just to go up the lift, look around and back down again was over priced.",
          "We decided to go up the tower to see the views whilst enjoying a drink. The man in the kiosk was unsmiling as he took our money, when we wanted to pay by card this was met with a sigh and a grunt. There was a man to take you up in the lift, who was similarly charmless and",

          "TV towers like this exist all over Germany and are always fun to visit. Views are stunning and the cafe at the top isn't unduly expensive. It's a good idea to visit before 11.00 - you save a lot on the admission price and might miss the coach parties too, giving yourself more",
          "This is a must for all visitors to Dusseldorf, cost about 8\u20ac each to ride lift to the top but once at the top the view is amazing. Great cafe up there too so you can sit relax and watch the world hurry along below.",
          "If you want to save some money and you do not mind to go there in the morning then visit this place between 10am and 11am so the ticket will cost 5 euros instead of 9. The view is great.",

          "One of the best places in Europe that must see , amazing view nice restaurants lots of topics for photographers and families River crises goes for 14 euro for 45 min across the river Nice place to drink and relax and have fun Similar to frankfurt but more beautiful from my idea",
          "The day we went was a lovely clear one so we had an excellent view of the city. Found it strange that we could not have tap water though so had to pay for bottled water. Did not have food but the beer was ok.",
          "Great view from the tower Staff very friendly and where more than happy to point out places The cafe is good, but could do with more choice or salad options, if you can not eat anything bread based your in trouble as it\u2019s sandwiches and cake ect",
          "Nice attraction, only strange that they won\u2019t accept card payments under \u20ac10 Also the parking machine accepts only cash so be aware, didn\u2019t expect that in \u201cmodern@ Germany.",
          "If you go before 11 (they open at 10) you will only have to pay 5 euros vs 9 euros to go to the top. We went when they first opened at 10 am on a clear beautiful day. It was neat to walk around and see the city from above. They even have a cafe up there so we were able to get",
          "It houses a revolving restaurant and an observation deck but I was more than happy to inspect the building from outside.",
          "We went up the tower at night and it was very quiet, the views from up there are great. Although, as you walk around the tower, I think it would be more helpful to know what you are looking at and maybe some information regarding this. Simular to what they have in the TV Tower",
          "Visited this tower both in the morning and again at night. Both times were fantastic. Lovely bar staff in the evening, would recommend going up for a cocktail! Views are spectacular.",
          "The Rheinturm offers great views of the city and the Rhine. The adult admission fee is most reasonable (certainly when compared to some other similar attractions around the world). The cafe/bar at the top too, is reasonably priced - in fact much in line with prices you'd expect",

          "This should be a must do on a visit to Dusseldorf, If you go on a clear day the views are spectacular. The lift pass is a bit pricey but well worth it, however the coffee and refreshments at the top were well priced though.",
          "9 euro to go up but would imagine that's what the going rate for an attraction is. The view is amazing. Cafe at the top which looked good. We only stayed for 15 mins so it is what it is.",
          "We did hesitate entering this tower. We had to pay \u20ac32 in total as a family but decided to do it. The view is, as expected magnificent. You can have some coffee and cake on top for the prices you also pay downtown.",
          "We found that 9\u20ac per adult is a little steep since it includes nothing else other than granting you access. However, the view is spectacular and worth one visit in your time there. Definitely recommended for passionate travellers.",
          "We loved going up the tower! It\u2019s \u20ac9 to go up or you can have coffee and cake included for \u20ac12.50pp. It\u2019s pretty steep for a family but worth taking a look. The apple cake was delicious.",

          "Ok, nice view but 9\u20ac for just a 5min roundabout is a bit too much... elevator staff was very unfriendly",
          "True that a view from the top may be interesting if you're lucky and the weather is good, but the tower itself is ugly. It has a \"clock\" on the outside, that tells you the time in \"digits\" or balls or signs or whatever, but should you care when it's such an ugly thing ? I didn't",
          "Obviously easy to find as it is the tallest monument of D\u00fcsseldorf. 9 euros to go up is on the expensive side but they have a deal at 12,50 for ticket, coffee and cake which makes it more reasonable. D\u00fcsseldorf Card gives you a 2 euros discount. No wait to go up/down and",

          "A lovely walk up towards the tower entrance. I wish at least part of the walkway had been covered though - it was a very hot day with no shade at all! The views from the restaurant level were pretty awesome! Food and drink prices slightly on the high side, but I guess that's",

          "Only 9\u20ac per adult to go the top. The lifts were under refurbishment which was slightly disconcerting when we entered but it was fine. Superb views of D\u00fcsseldorf. We had a few Pilsners which were quite good value considering you are a captive audience. Great value for money and",

The view of river and boatyard is something extraordinary. While if you want to see the digital time clock, I recommend you to visit",
          "Nearest tram stop is Staddtor and then only a couple of minutes walk through a park to the tower. Normal entry is \u20ac9 or there is a reduced rate of \u20ac5 before 11am. Great 360 views from the top. There was some building work going on during our visit. There are snacks and drinks",
          "While this landmark is beautiful and enticing. It was shut down for repair when we visited in May 2018. Pictures suggest that you can get a panoramic view of the city but we can only go on hearsay. We only saw the exterior. You may want to check before you take a long walk to",

          "The tickets were over priced. We paid \u20ac18 altogether for an average view. You can go downstairs into the \u2018outside section\u2019 which is basically an enclosed smoking area for staff. If you have any money left over you can pay to use binoculars to get a zoomed in view of the metal",

          "we just turned up for the view and quick drink. the place is nice and clean , views are good and drinks reasonably priced would suggest to look at the early/late bird prices for visiting as cheaper though this may mean you have to wait on lifts until reasonable number of people",

          "Entry to the tower is \u20ac9 and you go up 168-metres high. The view is incredible. Once you reach the top you can walk around the whole venue, which shows-off the city of Dusseldorf. The view at night is breath taking. I would recommend the German Sekt sparkling wine, which is",
          "It is very impressive from the outside, unfortunately it was closed for renevations the week that I was there.",

          "The views from the tower are exceptional. My visit was due to a flight cancellation, it was worth it. Spent a little over an hour enjoying a beer and the views. A nice way to pass some time.",
          "Lovely views over Dusseldorf and surrounding areas on a clear day. Nice place to have afternoon coffee and cake.",
          "The lovely feature of this observation tower is that is right next to the Rhine, affording a lovely view not just over the city, but also on the bending river. Of course, the view is not particularly scenic (hence not 5 stars), as Dusseldorf does not offer specially",
          "I would like to rate it with 5 stars due to its impressive height and excellent top view during a sky clear day, which is like a flying at 168m (550ft) altitude ground level. However entrance ticket is expensive 9\u20ac adults and 7\u20ac children (6-17 years old) except for special",
          "This was well worth a visit the cost was 9 euros and the cafe at the top surely have some of the greatest local views",
          "Really great views. No queue at all to get in. \u20ac30 for family of 4. bit overpriced but not too bad. viewing gallery could do with refurb, but you're there for the amazing views. we had a drink in cafe and was reasonably priced. worth a visit!!!",
          "Went here for a day out and it was delightful. Amazingly quiet and only \u20ac5per person. The views from the tower on a good day are spectacular. I would definitely recommend this.",
          "I like towers with a nice view so when visiting D\u00fcsseldorf we went up here to check it out. The costs were around \u20ac9 and after a short elevator ride you can walk around and see D\u00fcsseldorf from above. It was a bit misty but the view was still nice and there are some signs to",
          "We spent the afternoon at the top of the tower, were able to see the sunset while having a nice red wine glass, impressive view and atmosphere, this made our visit to this city. Excellent!",
          "We arrived early (just after 10am) and got an early bird ticket (1x adult & 1x teen = \u20ac10). Super fast lift - 4m per second. We were lucky with the weather too and we could see for miles! The views are definitely dependent on the weather, so make sure you go on a clear",
          "We went to the Rhine Tower beacuse we wanted to take a look at the view. But we found out it costed 9 \u20ac per person to take the elevetor. A bit too expensive... So we decided to spend our money elsewhere.",
          "A bit crowded place, but the view is superb. Really worth visiting. And as there is a bar, you can enjoy the view with a drink (a GT in our case)",
          "you have to go up the tower. The sightsees are beautiful. Al the places around are incredible. It will take you a morning to visit all you can see near the tower.",
          "Nice view. However, unexpectedly badly organised- you are taken to a crowded cafe where you are trying to take some photos while people are sipping their coffee..much more than the capacity of the place. Doesn't make much sense.",
          "Great activity on a cold and windy day. There are some areas that the floor is window and you can look straight down to the earth!",
          "Elevator goes 4m per second... Price entrance affordable and snack possibilities while enjoying the outstanding view on the Rhine! Don\u2019t miss it",
          "An impressive tower visible from every point in the city. We arrived when it was closed, but in any case the tower looked beautiful and probably the view from it is even more impressive.",
          "A little bit expansive, but from there you can see all around. It's very impressing. This place is highly recommanded to impress your children!!",
          "Its nice experience to see Dusseldorf at 167 Mt high. even the evenings too but I recommended in sunny daylight. You can spend a good time, also you enjoy a bar at top of tower. There is plenty car parking area andalso easy access for the Wheelchairs too",
          "I didnt visit the restaurant but the view was really nice and you can overlook all areas of Dusseldorf.",
          "Being a snowy day we already knew we wouldn't get a great view at the top of the Rhine Tower but we were at least looking forward to some drinks in the nice bar as advertised. The incredibly steep price just to get in almost put us off but we thought it would be worth it. In the",
          "After a hefty \u20ac9 each, you are transported by highspeed elevator to the restaurant at 168m. The view is fantastic (if you find a place) and it is nice to sap your coffee while below you the ships are struggling against the stream in the rhine below you. When we were there, the",
          "Walk along the Rhein and you will see the Rhein Tower as it dominates the skyline. A striking feature of the town and to view costs nothing for the money conscious. If in town worth checking it out.",
          "Cool place to enjoy the city up to Cologne from the height, both at night and during the day. The tower is also a clock,points move and sparkle. The restaurant is very nice, it moves as well, so one can see the districts.",
          "I think this is quite expensive. If you do not visit the restaurant, you do not go to the top! Also, on this level, you do not get a 360 degree view as its blocked off. You are not advised of this when buying your ticket!",
          "I have been here twice, a couple of years ago and last weekend. I remembered that I loved it a couple of years ago but I am honest if I say that that was not the feeling I had last weekend. What a overcrowded and touristic place is it now. No space to take your time and take a",
          "Amazing views but earl grey tea leaves a bad taste stick to the beer. 9 euros each to get to the top worth a visit. Nice and peaceful and fantastic transport links. If you want the restaurant seats book in advance",
          "A beatiful tower beside Rheine river. With a ticket of 9 \u20ac you can go to its food court at elevation of 168 meters. You can see a beautiful part of Rhine river and a view of Dusseldorf city from there",
          "Overseeing the river and offering a lovely view of D\u00fcsseldorf; and the food and ambience was quite lovely.",
          "9 euros is kind of expensive but totally worth it if you want to see a nice view of the entire city relax and have a snack.",
          "For just 15euros each we had a pot of coffee and a cake here with some great views of the city. Fantastic place if you want some great pictures to add to your photo album. Highly recommended for a city trip here!! Great views of the river Rhein from here!! Plus the restaurant",
          "Took the lift to 168m and arrived in a circular overview of the city with a very good coffee shop to stay and enjoy the view. You can see also the nearby MedienHafen, with it's interesting architecture. There is also a restaurant at the upper floor of the coffee shop, but we",
          "take a trip up the tower and see the city at its best spent 2 hours drinking wine and watching the world go by",
          "The Rhine Tower offers a bar, restaurant and view of the entire Dusseldorf area and the Rhine. The bar was nice but very crowded and understaffed. Lots of inconsiderate folks monopolizing the seating and not eating or viewing. Expensive to ride to the top.",
          "Get a good view of the entire Dusseldorf city. However, nothing else to inside the watch tower, they should have added more information / history of Dusseldorf.",
          "Amazing sight to see day and night - I just lovely being here and meeting new people and seeing different places. On every trip it is a new experience and adventure \ud83e\udd42\ud83e\udd42\ud83e\udd42\ud83e\udd42",
          "I disagree with the cost to go to the top of the tower. The view is great but that price gives me heartburn. I felt bad for our host that took us up there when we first moved to Germany.",
          "Worth while seeing at night, the tower closes at 1am, there are less people (avoid the crowds), bar is still open and the city (including the Rhine) is lit up, definitely worth while and even worth taking a nice stroll along the Rhine (city is considerably safe)",
          "We came to visit Frank Gehry's work and happened to pass by the Rhine Tower at night. It lights up at night. Good view from afar at the promenade or close by at the foot of it. If you are interested in architecture, especially Frank Gehry's work, it is worth it to make a trip",
          "Was only 9 euro to ascend the tower, offers great views of the city. Unfortunately, being Dusseldorf it was foggy so make sure you go up on the one day of the year that Dusseldorf gets sun.",
          "The Rheinturm was really the first attraction we went to when we arrived in Dusseldorf. It's a great way to see the city as a whole and the riverfront in particular. It's a cool place to visit after you've settled into Dusseldorf so you have some context for what you're looking",
          "Great Birdseye view of the area. Menu is always available for sit down but just the revolving view is phenomenal. A few euro to go up but worth it!",
          "The lift brings you up 168 meters or even more if you want to go to the restaurant (we skipped on it). The views are amazing, although it is almost impossible to take pictures at night time as windows reflect the bar's lights. You can see the whole city of Dusseldorf, including",
          "Very busy during the weekends with a mixture of people young and old. A pint of lager is around 5 euros at least",
          "The entrance cost can sound a bit dear (10 EUR for the elevator fee), but it is definitely worth it. Upon arrival at the top of the tower (168m above ground), one has a 360\u00b0 view of D\u00fcsseldorf city and surroundings. K\u00f6ln and other cities can be seen. There is a caf\u00e9 on top of",
          "Cool to be so high and value is okay at \u20ac5. We went on a Sunday morning so nice and quiet. Worth seeing, although not actually much to look at, except the Rhine of course",
          "Beautiful place where you can see panorame of Dusseldorf's aglomeration. In the top of the tower also you can eat really nice food and enjoying your visit there.",
          "If you visit Dusseldorf a trip up the Rheinturm is a must. The high speed lift whisks you to the top in no time and the views, weather permitting over the city are, weather permitting,really good. The restaurant is reasonably priced and serves a good variety of drinks. Entry is",
          "It's high and you can see far around. But actually there is nothing special to look at. Buildings is what you can see in every town. The view on the river was the one that saved the situation.",
          "Looking out onto the city and night while drinking botanical gin cocktails is something that you won't forget for a while, such an amazing view! The cocktails are pretty expensive but as you'd expect for nearly 200m from the ground.",
          "Visitors to D\u00fcsseldorf should consider going up to the Rheinturm, especially on a clear and sunny day. You would be able to see as far as the towers in Cologne! There is a bar and lounge on the viewing deck at 168 meters. Entrance is rather pricey (9 Euro for adults, kids",
          "Nice walk and lots of restaurants, Cafe and bars. You would definitely find something you like. Tried one Ice Cream shop do not remember it's name but was great. If I walk back again I will surely look it up on Trip Advisor and post my comments. Their coffee is Segafredo, prices",
          "We opted to have dinner at level 180. Service and food was excellent and to top it all the view was breathtaking. The man in the ticket booth is very helpful. Nice experience.",
          "Quite the panorama and great if you like that sort of thing. You will pay 9 euros per person for the experience.",
          "The tower is really tall, so where ever you might be walking, you can spot it easily. I didnt go up, just walked around it, since its near a lot of stops!",
          "For \u20ac9 you can't really complain. The viewing deck gives you a good view across the city especially on a crisp clear day. We had a drink at the cafe and admired the view but didn't venture up to the restaurant.",
          "It's 2017 however they only accept cash here (with no ATM around as it seems), please keep this in mind! Once inside, it's like a trip back to the 80's. The view is nice and you don't feel rushed to enjoy the view and get back down, as there are seats everywhere and you can get",
          "I have the D\u00fcsseldorf Card, you get a 2 \u20ac discount. Since it wasn't a really good day, I decided that paying 7 \u20ac wasn't worth it. At this point, not sure if the Card was a good idea either.",
          "Its great to have a view of Dusseldorf but its a bit pricy as you just go around and see everything in 10 minutes. There is a bar but pricy too.",
          "We have been 2 adults and 2 kids. We saw the view and after 5 mints they wanted to go. Not very interesting for kids.",
          "Good views well priced entry ,only downside was the top restaurant was not open till 2pm not very well noticed on board outside we had a German Friend with us she thought it was not very well displayed on notice board looked like it was open from 12pm for coffee & cake",
          "Very high tower, easily reachable by walk from the old town centre. You can reach the tower walking along the river; this could be very nice and relaxing. Once you reach the top of the tower, you can enjoy a 360\u00b0 sight of Dusseldorf. If you want you can take a coffee and take a",
          "Beautiful place. Lots of restaurants and bars. Perfect for a walk when the weather is good. The view is good especially around sunset.",
          "They had no student discount, yet with my love for beautiful, far reaching, sights, this was absolutely worth the price. The ride up was accompanied by a lift-operator who had the key, so only he could operate the elevator up to the 168 meter panorama which was truely amazing.",
          "Visited with family following lunch at a nearby hotel. Quite busy but no problems ascending by lift to the viewing area. Great panoramic views of Dusseldorf and kids were fascinated by the boats going up and down the river. Nice little cafe for refreshments whilst sitting taking",
          "Worth a visit for great views of the city. Bar available cakes and afternoon tea. Special prices for early admission if it fits in with your plans.",
          "In appox 40 minutes you are doing a round and can enjoy a great panorama of the city. You can choose \"non-movable\" seats as well. Menu is not big but everyone can find something. Tasty, but not wow - obviously this restaurant makes a focus on the view - not the food. Service is",
          "Great views, breath-taking. Well worth taking the time. Excellent panoramic view of Dusseldorf and the surrounding area.",
          "A short ride up in the elevator to be met with a great view. Personally think 9 euros is expensive. But a must if you want to cross it off your bucket list!",
          "The tower is amazing and you get a great view of D\u00fcsseldorf and the surrounding areas. There is a bar at the top and charging points for mobile phones. Well worth the entrance fee.",
          "Enjoyable visit. From the top you also can spot the tower in Cologne. There's a coffee shop and a restaurant on the top of the tower.",
          "The tower has a really nice view, I went when the rheinkirmes was on so we had that to see as well. The bar on top is expensive but it is expected. Nice place to watch the sunset",
          "A little expensive to get to the top and also while you are in the cafe but the views are well worth it and you don't have a time limit. The food and service in the cafe are second to none, worth every penny and the quality of food is amazing and service is excellent.",
          "Not to bad value at just under 10 Euros each and toilets and a cafe available while your up there. Its a place were you can take 1o minutes or a few hours. We went on a Saturday morning and was getting very busy when we left and could be a pain when busy.",
          "Visited the Rheinturm while we stayed in D\u00fcsseldorf, although 9 euros is quite expensive we were expecting way more and thought it was fair enough for the amazing views you get from the top. There are tables situated around the windows however you can sit at them without having",
          "Breath taking view. A beautiful clear day \"you can see forever\". Look down to the Rhine river and see the parliament building from here and other famous buildings. Very nice! There is a restaurant too.",
          "It was well lit and the view was perfect as D\u00fcsseldorf welcomed Tour de France. Sitting close by with friends for drinks was made colorful with the beautiful lighting.",
          "We went up the tower for the view and to photograph our boat in the marina below. However, we found ourselves transfixed by all that was going on particularly on the River Rhine, for instance we watched a coal barge draw into the wall below, with his lifting crane out, saw a",
          "Just go and see for yourself - a jaw dropping view and a great place to sit and have a beer in the bar area with friends. We were a party of 2 couples and were using the motor rail service from Dusseldorf to Verona and needed a fun place to visit for an hour following checking",
          "For anyone visiting D\u00fcsseldorf, I highly recommend to visit the Rheinturm. It is the tallest structure in the state NRW at 250 m. The views are great and the prices are justified. There is even a restaurant on the second level above the viewing platform level. The food is very",
          "The view was awesome as you probably can imagine. I just wish that there was more you could do than just walk in and out. You can go to restaurant if you have enough people with you and a reservation. There was also a cafe, but it was both expensive and not the best cappucino on",
          "It is very Nice too have all the city sights ar once. If yoi have D\u00fcsseldorf tourism card, you can get discount.",
          "Nice media tower basically it is a restaurant upstairs with beautiful view s of the entire city of D\u00fcsseldorf. The admission fee for adult is \u20ac9 and teenage is \u20ac7. First time traveller in D\u00fcsseldorf is highly recommended to pay a visit then you will never get lost in the city.",
          "Stunning views and a great place to enjoy a late afternoon beer or tea and cake whichever you fancy.",
          "After spending the previous couple of days in a haze from all the Altbier we decided to do something a bit touristy. We opted on the Rheinturm as it was the obvious choice being such a prominent landmark. We managed to drag ourselves out of our Alt induced stupor and get there",
          "Can get busy so try and get there early. Like most attractions, here can get busy. Excellent views over the city and river. Well worth it.",
          "Nuff said. It's a great view. The bar/cafe has some nice snacks. It's cheap at 9 euros. Didn't try the restaurant.",
          "Someone said we had to do it so we did. You can get senior rates so I think we paid around 5 euros. It's well worth it for the spectacular views of the town. Wonderful views down the Rhine. There's a cafe. Prices not too bad considering. Great cheesecake!",
          "Arrived first thing on a sunny morning, nearly the first visitors. I had unrestricted access to take all the photos I wanted to without hindrance. A fantastic way to view and orientate yourself with the city. On a clear day the views are incredible obviously including the Rhine.",
          "Me and my husband went up the tower there you find a cafe/bar where you can sit and have a drink looking at the whole city from above its a beautiful experience",
          "Only if you are interested to have panoramic pics of the town ! A snack bar offers soft and alcohol drinks.",
          "We went to the Rhine Tower before dinner on a business trip. It has an incredible view of the Rhine meandering it's way through D\u00fcsseldorf and it's surrounding areas, with river barges going up and down its waters. It is a great place to enjoy the view, hang out with friends or",
          "Cocktails were amazing. So flavourful! A bit of mix up with the bills, which was awkward but apart from that, a very good place to have a drink whilst overlooking the beautiful Rhein and Dussledorf. The ticket salesmen and lift operator are slightly unusual in that they keep",
          "On a clear day you can see up to kuln . Great view of the city and the surronding . recomanded highly.",
          "This is an absolute MUST if you are visiting D\u00fcsseldorf! I am actually scared of heights but this was so breathtaking to view that all of the fear went away. I even found myself leaning out into the window to look down. I love that there are neighborhoods written onto several of",
          "A must see if in Dusseldorf! The views of the city are fantastic!! The lift has transported you up 168.5 metres in seconds & i am not kidding i dont think its even half a minute?! We didnt do the restaurant up above as it was afternoon and we were heading bk in the evening",
          "Great attraction. There were no lines in the afternoon on a weekday. A little expensive for an elevator ride, but it's vacation, so do it. It's worth the view. 360 view behind glass from the top. If you collect coins from cities, you can get them at the top of the tower. Oh,",
          "You can see for miles over the city. Revolving restaurant I did not visit. Worth going up for the views. Lots of bars and restaurants nearby at ground level",
          "We visited this tower on a slightly overcast day but the views were still stupendous. There is an entrance cost but it's definitely worth it. There is a bar at the top selling alcoholic drinks, coffees etc but how lovely to indulge in afternoon tea whilst enjoying the views.",
          "This was a great attraction, but honestly it was a bit expensive. If you're in a small group it should be fine, but with bigger groups it might start to get a bit expensive. Also, the drinks and snacks were VERY expensive.",
          "The tower itself and surrounding area is very nice. there are lots of restaurants in the river side serving delicious foods. try it!",
          "You get a great view of Dusseldorf from top. Carry a good camera. Also there is a bar/restaurant on observation deck.",
          "You should vist tower. Is very nice, amazing view and can have some beer or dinner up there. Recomended",
          "The tower offers the view of the city and surrounding areas. For me, it is the best attraction in this city. However, I have to admit that there are not many interesting place to see here.",
          "Gud panaromic view from the top with a nice restaurant . Just be the to Rhine River a must walking tour . Enjoy yr holidays n Dusseldorf .",
          "Hop on Hop off bus stop & worth the price to travel up very high to get the best view of D\u00fcsseldorf & surrounds",
          "Since you can see this from almost anywhere in the city, it makes a convenient way to figure out where you are if you get lost.",

          "Lovely views and good food with a nice bar with good service and interesting elevator ride which is not too long",
          "Good drinks (I recommend one called \"Zombie\"), amazing view and easy to go. Team was very polite. There is a bar (drinks and food) and also a restaurant on the top, but I recommend that you go before 11 a.m. and after 10 p.m. - prices are almost 50% less at this time.",
          "I joined a party of 30 for dinner, very good food choice and service. Obviously great views as the Sun was setting overlooking the Rhine. Not special but very nice.",
          "This will cost a minimum of around \u20ac120-. For this amount we had the set 4 course dinner and a few drinks. The food was fantastic (with the exception of 'herb ice cream', unless thats your thing) and the views were magnificent. staff were friendly and punctual. well worth a",
          "The hop-on and off bus stop here and it was a spot to see. If I were to get here on my own it would of been difficult.",
          "Booked a table in the restaurant recently to celebrate our birthdays. The meal and wine was absolutely delicious. It was a beautiful evening so the view from the restaurant was fantastic, really added to the whole experience. Only disappointment was the cocktail lounge was",
          "We went in the evening in first week May around sunset.. the view is beautiful and their cocktails are really good. Do visit.",

          "Rhine tower amazing height about 240 meters with a panaromic rrestaurant at the top that turnes around 360 degree within a hour.a must see location in Dusseldorf but you can see it from every where!!!",
          "i have been there on a rainy day on May 2014 and it was great to be indoor because it was heavily raining outside but still i enjoyed the view from the top and had a lot of pictures and the design of the tower is great ; the angled glass walls provides better views... it worth",

          "We only went up to the viewing tower but it was well worth it for the fabulous view all around D\u00fcsseldorf and watching the boats on the river. My husband doesn't like heights but had no trouble with this. It was a beautiful sunny day which made the experience better. There are",
          "D\u00fcsseldorf is a huge city and this is the ideal place to really appreciate that. Only 9euros to the top where there is breathtaking views and also a bar where we stopped for coffee and cake. Friendly staff speaking various languages",
          "Fabulous place to visit, weather needs to be good to make the most of the views, we never miss it when we visit D\u00fcsseldorf, the journey in the lift is quick if not usually a bit squashed, however you forget all this when you get out at the top, we have never eaten in the",
          "Visited here as part of a weekend break. The tower offers excellent views across the city. It's \u20ac9 to go up or \u20ac12.50 with a coffee and a cake in the cafe at the top. We chose this option so we could enjoy a drink whilst taking in the views.",
          "What an interesting place to visit. If you are in any way frightened of heights them this is not a place for you to visit. Great views from the bar at the top.",
          "This is the highest tower in Germany (240.5m) From here you can see almost whole D\u00fcsseldorf.Bar is on 168m and restoraunt is on 180m.Bit expensive but shure worth visiting",
          "Fantastic panoramic views of D\u00fcsseldorf and 30 miles in all directions! A nice restaurant greets the visitor at 170 odd metres! Not for anyone suffering with vertigo!",
          "The tower is cool but not great since you have to move around the tables in the cafe. I mean its Ok to have cafe inside but not mixing it with panoramic attraction. Also not OK that they don accept cards to pay for entrance... guys how about 2017? Was must-see on our list but",
          "Both myself and my wife enjoyed our trip at the top of this tower and the views were stunning plus the cake was okay too It wasn't too expensive and took about an hour and a half so a good time filler whilst on the open top bus tour",
          "Get there by chance; no previous plans. Arrived earlier before eleven, ticket just 5 Euros. Incredible fast lift made 180 m in just few seconds, amazing. You feel the change in pressure on your ears. By that time not many people; you have the view all free for you for amazing",
          "took granddaughter up to top level and enjoyed great views and a terrific local beer. The staff were very friendly and this is one of the best \"turns\" I've been to.",
          "Visited the tower and had a meal in the restaurant which was lovely. Strange sensation to start with moving with the tower but worth it for the views. Costs \u20ac9 per person just to get up the tower though. The cocktails were brilliant but a little expensive. I would visit here",
          "Lovely panoramic views over dusseldorf from the viewing tower!! Walked round and took in all the sites!! Nice cafes on the viewing floor and a revolving restaurant above!! The kids got a bit bored as apart from the view there's not much else!! Thought 9 euros for adults a bit",
          "for people who like altitude, Rheinturm is a great place to visit. It costs 9 euro to use the elevator to get to 168 meters height. From that point you'll get 360\" panorama of the city, windows on the angle make your feelings even better - some people scared a bit to look down",
          "Do not miss to visit. The panoramic view with a fantastic restaurant and cafe on the top just make for an awesome evening out.",
          "A common tower you can find in most cities. however, when it is dark. its blue color makes it suitable for photography, specially from around the river bank.",
          "We went up with a few family members who were visiting for the weekend. Quite expensive for what you get. Not the best with the kids as they got bored however would be nice on a evening for a romantic date.",
          "You can see the rhine river and the other areas in NRW at the top of the tower. It has a restaurant that serves delicious food. It's really romantic and relaxing.",
          "Visited early evening so we could see the view both in the day and night. \u20ac25 euro for 3 of us to go up the tower. Very busy but breathtaking views. The lift takes you to the snack bar where you can have hot and cold drinks, cocktails and other alcoholic drinks plus snacks. You",
          "A worthwhile visit, whatever the weather. You pay an entry fee and go the distance in an attended lift. However you can spend as much time as you like once up there during the extensive day and night opening hours.",
          "Beautiful tower you can see almost from everywhere. By night the colors complete the visual. Very beautiful views from the top, worth value a visit.",
          "We payed \u20ac10 pro person to go to the bar & lounge (168m). We went on a Thursday and there was now queue. The view was very beautiful!",
          "Came for a break and shopping. Great atmosphere down in the old town, live music dancing and not bad food. Walked to Ko Gallery and sat outside watching the world go by. Easy to enjoy this friendly city.",
          "Amazing views from the top with a nice cafe to grab something to eat. Were lucky enough to visit on a sunny day which I imagine makes all the difference",
          "For as cheap as \u20ac9 you can go up and see dusseldorf beneath you, you can also sit down and take a drink at the cafe. If you want to go even higher go up to the restaurant, which also rotates on the hour!",
          "It's the symbol of Dusseldorf and it is well worth the visit. You are so high up that it makes sites in the city seem so close. We went up on a sunny day and we could see for miles. Absolutely stunning. I'm not great with heights and as you look down you really get an idea",
          "On a recent trip to Dusseldorf, we were both really looking forward to going to the summit of the Rheinturm for a drink on our last night in Germany. Unfortunately, our experience was very poor. First off, there was very little to be seen from the tower at night as the bright",
          "A good walk down the river on a Saturday morning to blow away the beer cobwebs was followed by a trip up the tower. Great views, nice cake and the funniest lift operator in the world. Whats not to like",
          "The Panorama from Media Hafen is amazing. Walking from the Rhein Turm to the Hyatt hotel is a great experience. Plenary of modern buildings of famous architects and is a place to be for visiting D\u00fcsseldorf.",
          "Located in the medienhafen, a place where you will have to wlak around anyway, this is certainly recommended. Good view and a good snack; for the hungy men a rotating restaurant ontop (after 14.00)",
          "The tower is not too high as many others around the world, But it is a nice way to spend some time with friends and family. Ticket price I paid was \u20ac9 (Adult) and there was a cafe in the tower. If you go on the top floor there is a restaurant and you have to dine in for staying",
          "One part of our international family has lived in Duesseldorf and in Cologne since about 1900. Our international family likes to meet the one year in Germany in Hamburg, or Bremen, or Duesseldorf/ Cologne, or Munich; the next year in USA, the then following year in Canada, then",
          "9 euros will get you a 168metre lift ride to the 168 M bar. and amazing views of Dusseldorf. the sloping glass windows from floor level can be quite scary if your a bit scared of heights. the resteraunt is higher up the tower but on this occasion i gave it a miss.",
          "Very expensive and busy, had to wait long time for the lift to go up and even longer to go down . The place is okey , nice view but for this money 15 min view is not worth it at all . The restaurant is in a very good location but again I wouldnt pay their prices . However if you",
          "Walking along the edge of the river, and the heavens opened! Dash for the tower, along with a few other people, and end up with an unplanned spend to get in. Definitely worthwhile though, and even in bad weather the view is worth seeing. Cake was surprisingly reasonable,",
          "Unfortunately when we went to visit this site, we learned that is closed and has been for awhile. Disappointing, maybe they will find a new owner and reopen it soon!",
          "We had a dusseldorf card so went up to the restaurant for \u20ac7 each and just had a few rounds of drinks. We stayed the hour in the rotating restaurant so for a full 360 view of the city. Would recommend going up in the day so you can really see everything. Rounded off our trip",
          "The elevator takes you to the top of the tower in a few seconds. The 360 \u00b0 view of the city and the surrounding area is amazing and indescribable. There are good bars and an excellent restaurant. A must for anyone visiting the North of Germany.",
          "A neat experience. Short elevator ride to the top of the tower. 360 views of D\u00fcsseldorf. Tables all around to sit and enjoy a beverage and snack if you choose. Enjoyed sitting and watching boats traveling on the Rhine river.",
          "Visited the tower a couple of years ago. Having climbed up to the very top for a fee, we could see the city at night which definitely was a romantic experience",
          "The views are brilliant and the slow revolution of the restaurant means that you really get to see D\u00fcsseldorf from above. Service was good and the food was great. Would go back to the restaurant mainly for the views but the food helps to really enjoy the evening!",
          "The tower can be used just for view. You get to see Dusseldorf from the top and see the rhine river.",
          "We went here for a meal invited by a local- food was not special but the views were great- amazing how many canals and bardges",
          "Came here for dinner with some work colleagues and was slightly disappointed. Was expecting a trendy cocktail bar before dinner but it was pretty basic. Staff were also a tad curt with us (especially Laughing Larry the lift operator...he'd clearly had a sense of humour bypass!)",
          "Great value to go see all of Dusseldorf from one place, lift takes less than a minute and when you reach the top your met with a stunning vista as fair as the eye can see. The parliment building looks stunning from the top and worth seaking out. It's all indoors too so now wind",
          "From up on high you can see a long way. 172m from the viewing deck with angled windows so you can look straight down (if you want to) or even lie on the glass (if you dare). A good place to take some coffee and cake, but it can be a bit busy (Sunday mornings are best for this)",
          "Good value and great views. Shame that the cafe tables obstruct the views. Would go back up at night or sunset.",
          "When you enter the tower and take the elevator in order to reach the top, looking at the meters at the elevator tablet you think you will reach the clouds! And when you reach the top at 168 meters, when you see down from the edge of the glass you feel like you are flying! It is",
          "Due to the extreme weather, heavy rain and wind. We decided to go up the tower, felt it was a bit expensive at 9 euros per person. You have a great view of the city, but taking photos was difficult. As the neon ceiling lights reflex onto the viewing Windows.",
          "Totally advise all this is s must see attraction 360 degree view of D\u00fcsseldorf as the restaurant moves around as you eat. Great time spent with my son.",
          "We had a quick visit in tower for the view and it was worth it. On Wednesday evening place was almost empty so we didn't have to wait to get up and we could easily look around without interrupting others. We visited a bar (lower level). OK bar, but quite expensive.",
          "We recently paid a visit to the Rhine Tower in Dusseldorf. It is located on the banks of the river Rhine, and was a 15-20 minute stroll from our hotel. We arrived late morning, and paid the \u20ac9 each entrance fee at the base of the tower. We were then shown the way to a lift which",
          "The restaurant is a little overpriced, but you can always plan a date on some special occasion. Dusk would be the best time to visit. Rotating restaurant would be a better choice, I found the bar a little boring and off.",
          "It was really worth going up this tower and we were really lucky that the weather was sunny and bright and we got some brilliant views across the city. We had a lovely coffee which we drank whilst looking over the city. I can't remember the price we paid but it was reasonable",
          "I decided to go up the tower more to escape the miserable weather on a wet sat afternoon. The ticket costs 9 euros to go up to the viewing platform. The views are good offering panoramic views of the city and surrounding areas. There is a cafe offering food and drinks.",
          "You have to see the rhine tower when you visit D\u00fcsseldorf. It is worth to pay and go. The view is spectacular and the coffee shop at the top is very good.",
          "What af wonderful place and magnificent view!!! Very friendly staff - after we had a few misunderstandings cleared how my guest would like to have his duck served/prepared - mostly due to a language misunderstanding. The food was perfect, the serving time was fine, nice wines",
          "I didn't go in, and I'm not even sure if possible, but it's a decorative backdrop for pictures. Was nice.",
          "Went here to see the views - which were amazing - and ended up staying for lunch, just in the bar area. We got pizzas which were really good. Would definitely recommend and would go again.",
          "Go before 11 and it's half price, I think if I'd paid full price I would have been disappointed. We didn't eat or drink here so we only spent 20 mins here as there's not much to do once you've looked at the views...",
          "I've been to many towers in different cities. Just like from every other tower the views are great, even at night. Unlike other towers, the viewing platforms here are wholly occupied by a cocktail bar and a restaurant. I did have a coffee there which I enjoyed, however as",
          "When you visit city, you took picture of the trademark of the city and this is what I did. Been here in Sunday morning so not much of what I can do so I just took the picture of this tower in the winter's dawn.",
          "Must do when in Dusseldorf! I orderd the carpaccio & gnocchi. It was a big plate! And the flavours were absolutely briliant! The fact that you move and turn around was not so great for me, I got a little sick. But my friends didn't complain. There's also a cocktailbar.",
          "the view is the only thing worth going here. I wouldn't pay again for this location. Food was cold and nothing special at all.",
          "We went with the family to the Rhine tower and we bought a champan bottle in the bar. The views are spectaculars",
          "It is an amazing place to have a regular meal for a good-ish price with one of the most beautiful overviews I have ever seen. Your table will swing around (very slowly \ud83d\ude0a) 360 degrees in about 2-3 hours so you can see the whole city. On every window you are getting an",
          "Spent a good hour here and enjoyed a delicious hot chocolate whilst watching the boats on the Rhine below. Very enjoyable - and a bargain at five euros if you visit before 11am!",
          "Must see place , the Radio Tower, tallest Radio tower indeed, a good starting point to walk towards the Ferris wheel and sulk in lots of historic facts about D\u00fcsseldorf, a very interesting place to see :))",
          "We visited the tower on a Wednesday in January. Luckily not very busy and the weather was clear. Great view. I would not recommend to visit this location on a busy day.",
          "Really nice views over dusseldorf once you pay the 8 euros to use the elevator. You can see the whole city from there. However the restaurant/ bar is a little pricey up there but worthwile to enjoy the views.",
          "This tower is a nice way to see the city and everything around. It really puts the area in perspective. You can see everything from the Television studios to farms. Its fun to lean on the glass, and there is also food and beverages, and a deck 10 metres higher with a restaurant.",
          "Beautiful building with a reasonable entrance fee (9euro pp) when compared to other city counterparts (I.e Vertigo 42 in London) as you are not forced to purchase anything and can just go up to enjoy the view and stay as long as you wish. Impressive view from 168m (cafe) and a",
          "The unique point of view over the entire city of D\u00fcsseldorf ! The view is definitely worth the 9 Euros to climb up over 168 meters and have a walk along the 360 degrees gallery, and have a drink at the bar.",
          "Lift goes very quick and the views are excellent 360 of the area around D\u00fcsseldorf there is a bar up there to!",
          "The cafe at the top of the tower is not over priced,friendly and welcoming and you can enjoy the wonderful views for as long as you wish,a must do if visiting the city",
          "Spectacular view. Fine wine and food but not polite staff. A little bit expensive elevator!!! Not far away from the city.",
          "Very disappointing. We had went on a weekday at 9pm (Last orders for food at 10pm) only to be told by a passing waiter that they were fully booked even though standing there we could see countless empty tables. We had paid the entrance fee of 9 euros each after informing the",
          "You get nice a brilliant all round view of Dusseldorf. The bar at the top is nice too.. You can sit and have a good drink while you soak up the views.",
          "It is definitely worth the visit when in Dusseldorf. Make sure you go on a day when the weather is good. The view is beautiful from both the bar and the revolving restaurant. If you decide to have dinner at the restaurant, you need to make early reservations.",
          "We only had a little over a half day here, so we walked from the hotel and took the lift up to the top. Nice view and you can get a coffee or a beer at the top and watch the world go by, albeit from very high up!",
          "From Rhine Tower you can have a nice view for all the surrounding areas. Elevator is fast and the viewing deck is indoors",
          "Worth taking time out to visit the Rhine Tower. Pick a good day though as the area is prone to fog! Good view from the top. There is a snack bar so you can get a coffee if you want to spend a while up there.",
          "In my opinion, this tower is a bit overpriced. The view was not spectacular and it's essentially the same view as when you're at the bottom of the tower. My recommendation: don't bother going inside.",
          "What a great tourist attraction. \u20ac9 each is a fair price. You can stay as long as you like and the facilities are good. A decent coffee shop on the panoramic deck and a fantastic revolving restaurant. A little more expensive than elsewhere but you're paying for a great",
          "Food 10/10 Price 6/10 Atmosphere 10/10 Staff 7/10 Views of D\u00fcsseldorf 11/10 Relax and take in the amazing views of all of D\u00fcsseldorf at the top of the tower in a 4* Restaurant. This is not to be missed when visiting the city. It is quite expensive however I think K it's",
          "Firstly yes the view would be great on a clear day/night, but we went with the intention of eating food, arrived at 9pm (last orders are at 10pm) mentioned in the reception area that we wished to eat food and were told yes no problem, so paid the \u20ac18 entry fee (\u20ac9 per adult)",
          "For \u20ac9 it is a very pleasant experience, the views are fantastic! The bar up the tower is very reasonably price, with a bottle of beer being approximately \u20ac3'50! It is well worth the trip, roughly mile-mile and half walk from the Altstadt!",
          "Awesome place to visit. I saw the complete city view from the top of this tower and the lifts were too fast that it took a few moment to reach us there.",
          "Such an amazing experience. It was a great lunch for the two of us, reasonably quiet, quite good quality food, helpful service. The best part, obviously, is just sitting there watching the view as you slowly turn.",
          "Worth a visit . Great views over the city and the Rhine . Lift takes you really quickly to the viewing platform . Bar that serves coffee cake and alcohol .",
          "Travelled up the 160m to the bar at the top of the Rhine Tower and had a couple of drinks, the views are wonderful although a bit more information about what each area is would have been a nice touch - the bar isn't too overpriced, less than 8 euro for two beers - can't really",
          "Fabulous experience. The tower only cost us \u20ac5 before 11:00am to visit and the views were terrific. You can see the whole city and beyond from the bar viewing platform. Incredible 360 degree views of the city with super fast lifts whizzing you to the top. A must see!!",
          "Came here with friends after dinner for a drink. Very good views of Dusseldorf the city looked great all lit up for Christmas. It cost \u20ac9 each to use the lift up to the bar, reasonably priced drinks and friendly staff.",
          "Fantastic views from the viewing gallery, nice cafe/bar and plenty of places to sit and watch the world go by. Absolutely recommended as a way to get a feel for this great city. Opens at 10 am and if you go before 11 am there is a reduced entrance charge.",
          "We visited her on our trip to the Christmas markets in D\u00fcsseldorf. We visited at night to see the lights. It's not far to walk from town along the Rhine. It's 9 euros each to go up 168 feet for a drink but at least the drinks aren't too expensive. It's hard at night to take",
          "As my title says this tower is great and you can't miss it. The tower is the main provider of telecommunication to the city. At over 204 metres high I believe that it's the tallest tower in Dusseldorf. Special features include a light sculpture, bar and restaurant.",
          "Skyline menu is an offer on the website (see picture attached). Lovely setting at the top of the tower, music a bit quiet and can hear the beat of the base of the music from the bar. Meal was delicious. However seemed a bit rushed, first drink which we had was Hugo from our",
          "Whilst over for the Xmas markets we decided to go to go up the tower,It's was a 20 minute walk from the old town.We went Monday morning at 11ish so no que to get in,It's was 9 euros each entrance fee(cash only).There was a wait of about 10 mins when inside for the lift to arrive",
          "We didn't make it to the top but I wanted to do a review to warn anyone else thinking of going - get cash first! We queued for a while only to be told once we got to the counter that they only took cash! It is a surprise for any tourist attraction these days not to take card",
          "I didnt have chance to climb inside but it looks very nice from outside especially in sunset. It is seen from everywhere",
          "Curiosity got the better of us and we finally found ourselves up on the Rhine tower. Gives a good 360 degree view of the city - which is okay! . You can also enjoy food and drinks up here but we didn't try anything so I reserve my comments on it. There is an entrance fee for the",
          "We ventured down the river side towards the tower. Look out fur a fixed cabinet on the walk sway side filled with books that's basically an open library. It was a lovely idea (see pic) When you get to the tower there usca small entry fee and you jump into lift to the top.",
          "If you want some interesting views of Dusseldorf from high above and don't mind spending 9 euros, take the elevator to the top of this tower that sits along the Rhine. It was crowded at the time I was there and took some time in line before going up. There's a restaurant & bar",
          "The entrance fee is worth the view you get on the top. Go there around the \"blue time\" of the day, when daylight is still there but fading away and all the artificial lights start to glow. Enjoy a cocktail while you enjoy the view. The barkeeper is very talented and the prices",
          "Nice view around the city. There is a restaurants servicing drinks and small bites. There is no outside access which was disappointing. The entrance fee was nine euros.",
          "Quick ride up 168m to a beautiful overview of the whole D\u00fcsseldorf area and beyond. Parking is right under the tower and the 168m stop offers drinks and desserts. Further up is a restaurant although I did not travel there. Cost for the ride and the view was 9 euro, but I",
          "The 'Rheinturm' is just fantastic. You have a view over whole of Duesseldorf and further. There is even a cafe where we could sit down and just enjoy the spectacular view.",
          "Probably the best way to get the bigger picture of the Rhine and all the barges moving up and down river, incredible view and not to be missed.",
          "The lift only takes a few seconds to get to the viewing platform or the restaurant where you can relax and take in the views of the city. Entry is 9 euros during the day and it was nice to relax with a drink and look out across the city.Try leaning on the glass and looking out",
          "Walked along the Rhine where possible. It was a nice walk but in the cold you really need to wrap up warm.",
          "5 Euros are a good price for the great view over D\u00fcsseldorf directly next to the Rhine. You can watch ships passing by as well as planes taking off. The Rheinturm is next to the Medienhafen and not far from the \"Altstadt\".",
          "Espectacular view of D\u00fcsseldorf from above, and also a very impressive building. Very tall and interesting digital clock",
          "Loved it up here and I could gaze out at the views all day long, I loved the windows and finally plucked up the courage to lie on the window...... scary! We had a drink from the bar which wasn't too expensive so I would recommend this for sightseeing, it's well worth a visit.",
          "Nice view from the bar. The bartender is a good mixologist and they are using really fancy glasses for cocktail. The view is amazing 360\u00b0 over D\u00fcsseldorf. The bar itself can be warmer, it looks too cheap. I suggest to go there after 10pm when the lift is only 5\u20ac per person.",
          "Only charged \u20ac5 despite the board saying it was \u20ac9 so that was a good start. Straight up to 168th floor where the views are excellent if the weather is right. Nice bar area to sit and watch the barges and ships on the river and the city from above then walk 15 minutes to the",
          "It's worth to spend 9\u20ac for a ticket to go up and see the very nice view for the river and the city .",
          "Basically \u20ac9 to see Dusseldorf from above and its pretty much the same as seeing any city from a tall building. Stay for a coffee and enjoy the view to make the most of your \u20ac9. Personally, I wouldn't bother. Go for a drink in one of the boat restaurants along the banks of the",
          "There is a really nice view from the tower you can see at 360\u00b0 the city...but 36 euros 4 people?okay that is a nice place but on the top the bar is also pretty expensive...",
          "when you visit Duesseldorf, don't miss this one. A great view over the city and the land beyond with the Rhine meandering through it. I thoroughly enjoyed this. And the coffee was very good too, which is not always a given at touristy places like this.",
          "Stunning views, nice food, well tea and cakes. not to expensive but well worth the trip to the top. Relaxed and first class service from some happy staff.",
          "Sunday morning on a beautiful sunny day. The views over the town are amazing. Also bar is there for you to enjoy a drink and look over the river Rhine.",
          "We went up the tower at dusk, and had a drink in the bar looking out over the city as it illuminated. The entry cost was about \u20ac7 and the bar was reasonably priced too. The glass windows are angled so you can see the curve of the tower directly below. The glass panels are strong",
          "It was a fine clear day when we visited the tower and we could make out what appeared to be the Gasometer in Oberhausen, views over Dusseldorf and the Rhine are outstanding. We had coffee and cake in the caf\u00e9 bar which was expensive but good.",
          "only 9 euro for the visit but worth the trip on a sunny day, didn't have to reserve tickets just turned up.",
          "We took the lift up to the observation area and found such a fantastic 360 degree view of the city below. It was such a clear sunny day we could see pretty far. We were tempted into a little cake from the bar, which was really tasty. I would definitely recommend a stop here.",
          "You can't miss this 240 m high tower. It sits on the banks of the Rhine and is a must do if you are in D\u00fcsseldorf. It opens at 10:00 am and costs 5\u20ac to take the elevator to the top. From here you get 360 ' view. If you can, choose a sunny day, just nicer views. Even on a",
          "This is a place that needs to be visited if you go to D\u00fcsseldorf. The views are fantastic. We went in the day light but you can go at night as well. Do not forget your camera if you go. You can also drink and eat in the cafe bar and they offer some great cakes if you have a",
          "Quite expensive to access, but worth it for the stunning views stretching for miles on end. Accessed by a lift and seating and toilets available at the top. A rather pricey cafe at the top. I would recommend!",
          "We went up the tower as it's something you are supposed to do. It's quite pricey just to go up. But we came back at 'tower hour' between 7pm and 8pm, it was 12euro for entry and a cocktail, which we felt was more acceptable! The views were amazing, especially as the sun went",
          "Wonderful view of the City and beyond, Cocktails very good and spotlessly clean as anywhere in Germany is to be fair",
          "The Rheinturm is a fantastic and awesome way to view the whole city of Dusseldorf. It gives you a 360 degree view of the beautiful city. There is also a coin souvenir machine and a nice coffee shop/lounge to relax in. On a clear day you can see as far as Cologne. At night the",

          "Spent my first evening in Cologne with a trip up tower, followed by a walk along the river and over the bridge. The cost was only a few euros, fantastic value in my opinion. We went to see the sunset, there was around 30 people, by no means too crowded. Great views and a great",
          "I had visited Rhine Tower(Rheintrum) recently in Dusseldorf with my German friend on 1st September and it is really awesome. Beautiful night views from revolving restaurant and delicious meals. OF course, it is the best place to have night view of Dusseldorf and I would like to",
          "We visited the tower on a Wednesday in the late afternoon. Very lucky in as much as they have a special offer for a visit to the top between 1800 and 2000 on a Wednesday. It's usually 9 Euros to use the elevator but the offer gives you a trip to the top for 12 Euros but includes",

          "The Rhine Tower was beautiful to walk past and take a photo of at night! Quite close to the busy food section so we just walked there!",
          "Looking forward to this but found it disappointing and frankly a rip off to be expected to pay for the lift to reach the restaurant.",
          "If it is your first time visiting Dusseldorf, you should come here, just to see the whole city. It's especially pretty in the evenings. Skip the bar, overpriced and not worth it.",
          "Been to a number of cities with towers over the years however was pleasantly surprised with the experience in Dusseldorf. Went early doors which mean the ticket price was lower and the crowds smaller and this resulted in great views back over the city and harbour. Recommended to",

          "Well worth the visit the views are amazing . Go up in the lift have a tea or coffee Would recomend it to anyone for the views",
          "We visited during day time. It's a wonderful way to experience Dusseldorf and understand the city's special geography. We had a nice Espresso, a delicious cake and had lots of fun. We must add that visiting the top is also suitable for those who are mildly afraid of heights,",
          "We went there during the evening and it was completely useless. The blue lights that were around the building was making the windows bue too so you could barely see anything except for yourself in the window as well as the blue light. Felt like they only wanted you to sit in the",
          "Nice way to see the City when you're on a time limit. It's within walking distance of the Altstadt The quick lift ride to the top allows you to see a full panoramic view of the surrounding area on a beautiful sunny day. Wasn't too busy for a Sunday afternoon. Was also",
          "The tower sits by the Rhine river, with an amazing top view from the city. Cool place to start your tourism day there. Tip: Apparently you pay only \u20ac5 if you get there before 9am, which was our case. Regular price is around \u20ac10.",
          "We paid \u20ac9 each to go up the tower. Fabulous views. Had a drink and cake in the cafe and admired the scenery, lovely staff. Prices as you would expect for this kind of thing.",
          "We went on a weekday morning and it wasn't crowded. We got there when the doors opened and quickly went to the top. Seeing the city of Dusseldorf was nice. I got some great photos from above! For the price, it was well worth the visit.",
          "Been to a lot of similar towers in other cities and generally been pleased however this tower if a massive let down!. Firstly the price is far to expensive, a fair price would be about 5 euros, 9 euros if far too expensive. Secondly you can't actually get to the windows to see",
          "...weather permitting. Get yourself up here for the best view around. Access is usually swift and reasonably priced (dinner reservations at the restaurant used to have the lift included but dunno if that\u00b4s changed). You can see the whole of Dusseldorf and as far as the Ruhr",
          "A knee-shaking'ly good view. Not for those with a weak stomach. Reasonably priced entrance and bar- biers available to calm the nerves. Great location for spotting. Rumour has it that one of the glass windows fell out...thrill seekers beware!",
          "Lift moves smoothly up to the 168 metres high viewing platform, where you can enjoy 360 degrees views. There's also a bar so you can have refreshment while enjoying the view.Also helpful barmen who are experts at taking your picture with the view behind",
          "A great way of seeing all the surrounding area. If the sky is clear you can see miles into the horizon - fascinating. I would wait until its clear though so as to take full advantage of the view. Good value for money - kept on walking around the 360 degree views! The lift was",
          "We have been three times as we now live in Dusseldorf and its an interesting thing to do when we have visitors. Two times we have been to the cocktail bar - once at night & once in the day. Both times the views were incredible, obviously! The evening service was great,",
          "It's a given that if you find yourself in Dusseldorf then a trio up the Rhine Tower is a must. Naturally the 360 degree views are stunning, good value for money at only about 12 euros too. Not to be missed!",
          "If you pay attention on the lights all along the tower, you will know the time. In addition the view is amazing from up there! I totally recommend it.",
          "TV Tower is located in the city center, on the banks of the Rhine River, you can see it from anywhere. We have been quite difficult to reach by car. Optimal route including tunnels and GPS did not work. The place is nice ,you must go there if the visibility is good enough",
          "Having walked many miles in Dusseldorf 's streets - I have come to appreciate the sights beyond the Rhine River that Dusseldorf has to offer- there are the quaint shops and streets- there are wonderful and welcoming cafes and there is a section of high end couture- Dusseldorf",
          "A good place to visit to get a good view of Dusseldorf. 168 metres up! We went about 3 o'clock and didn't have to queue. Had a nice piece of cake and drink in there. The only thing what let it down was we had to wait for over 20 minutes for the lift to take us back down, I think",
          "It was 9 euro with no reservation. For 50 cents you can use the binoculars. It's a nice place to visit after walking past the promenade.",

          "You can have dinner at the rotating restaurant or you can go upstairs to the Cafeteria. The Restaurant is not the best one in D\u00fcsseldorf but it\u00b4s acceptable and a bit expensive compared to the quality. But it deserves a visit! I have been there with my family for my mom\u00b4s",

          "Enjoyed my trip to the top of the Rhine Tower with its 360 degree views and a bar at the top where you can sit have a drink and take in the vistas",
          "We visited the Rheinturm to get a panoramic birds eye view of Dusseldorf. Its easy to get to by tram. We paid \u20ac9 each entry which we thought was quite expensive, compared to other towers we've visited in Berlin and Munich. The lift is quite small but fast, the guide simply",
          "Nice view over the town, the bar wasnt really good except you could sit there. The drinks were terrible.",
          "You pay to ride the elevator up. Pay the extra for cake and tea. The entire seating area rotates so you can see all of the city if you stay in the restaurant for an hour. Great views and friendly service. Do not miss this great place.",
          "there is a nice view all over dusseldorf and the rhine river. and there is a nice cocktailbar -the highest in town- in it. the drinklist is modern and the cocktails mixed very well. so one can enjoy a cocktail at the evening with a nice view to the oldtown",

          "Great views, if you have a head for heights!! The windows slope outwards so if you stand close enough you can look straight down. In fact some more adventurous people were lying on the windows! Great views of the river and the town",
          "From the top you will overlook the whole city, river, etc. Very nice and the tickets are not expensive. Usually short queue. For me must see in D\u00fcsseldorf",

          "In terms of landmarks of Dusseldorf, the tower is probably the most famous. We thought it would be very expensive (\u20ac25+) but was pleasantly surprised to find it was under \u20ac10. When at the top you can see for miles and miles, which if you are visiting the area, is interesting.",
          "If visiting Dusseldorf, the Rheinturm (\"Rhine Tower\") is an iconic must. Located near other sites on the east bank, you get a fantastic view from the top.",

          "We really enjoyed our visit up the Rhine tower and only waited a minute or so for the lift..... Which was incredibly fast and smooth. Once at the top the view is magnificent. A really enjoyable experience!!",
          "What a disappointment! You pay \u20ac 9.00 to get up on the observation deck only to find out that you cannot take any good photos. The reason? They installed purple LED string lights at the ceiling which reflect in all the windows. This totally spoils the fun of taking photos from",

          "The tower is obviously visible from all over the city and accordingly sells itself. A gentle walk down the river is part of the experience and on a clear, sunny day it is almost essential. A swift elevator takes you to the 360 walk around with a seated area for the cafe/bar.",
          "The tower was well worth a visit while in Dusseldorf. The location is beautiful, right on the Rhine. The cafe at the top is a real tourist trap so don't expect anything more than overpriced snacks.",

          "It was lovely being at the top of this tower. You would not believe the views. Well worth the visit and by no means expensive",
          "Fun to say you went to the top, and excellent views of the city. Grab a coffee and snack and enjoy the view. Might be unsettling to those with fear of heights.",
          "If you visit Dusseldorf you must go here as the view is fantastic. You do have to pay to get in but its worth it, even if like me it was very vertigo inducing and could not stay up there for that long. Drinks a bit pricy than the average but its the experience that counts.",
          "Between one or two hours it`s enough to enjoy a beer or a cake at the bar and watch from above the entire D\u00fcsseldorf. You can also get cool views of the airport and landing planes :) There is also the possibility to have a nice lunch/dinner at the 360 degrees restaurant, which",

          "This type of tower is classic for tourists - so must be done! The view when you reach the top is spectacular - worth the time and money! In my opinion just don't plan to eat or drink something up there, you'll spend much more money than in other places below that are more",
          "The tower and its surroundings are truly majestic. The walk up to the tower and then the view at 168 m restaurant is amazing. It gives you the view of the whole city and the Rhine river. The adult fees is 9 euros and children under 4 go for free. If you go after 6.00 pm and",

          "Despite the fact I objected to paying 9\u20ac to go up in a lift the view from the top was well worth it. Busy but even so we enjoyed a glass of something cold while enjoying the view.",

          "It is a classical tower but it is well located for great views and modern with oblique windows allowing for nice pictures. Going there out of meal time allows for going \"upstairs\" at the revolving restaurant levels and enjoying the view while just having a coffee. Nice place,",
          "One of my favorite things I've done in D\u00fcsseldorf! Great view and especially fun if you've walked around a bit down below and can recognize some of the landmarks. I highly recommend going in the late afternoon/evening (a bit before it gets dark). Watching the city transform from",

          "I visited the tower with a friend on a cold, Sunday evening. The bar/restaurant area was empty. We had a few drinks. The bartender was nice enough. The drinks were reasonably priced. There\u2019s a decent view. Personally, I don\u2019t think visiting the tower is worthwhile. Unless you\u2019ve run out of things to do in the Altstadt area.",

          "Worth going to for a fantastic overview of the city and far beyond. From there acces to harbor district which is very different from altstad but definitly worth the visit for architectural combination of hisory and modernity. (The latter not always succesfull). Long wait for the elevator since they were using only one.",

It has been a part of D\u00fcsseldorf since 1929.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe name Benrath came from the \"Knights of Benrode\". The settlement was mentioned for the first time in 1222 in a document from Cologne where Everhard de Benrode is named as an attestor. By the end of the fifth century the area is known as \"Rode\" or \"Roide\", which is a cleared area. The castle and the manor of the Benrodes became property of the Counts of Berg by the 13th century.\nThe first church of Benrath was constructed in 1002.\nThe village developed parallel to the castle. The old Church St. C\u00e4cilia was built in that time.\nBenrath is a place of pilgrimage for Roman Catholic Christians.\nIn the time of Industrial Revolution Benrath grew very fast, because Benrath it next to the important Cologne\u2013Duisburg railway.\nIn 1929 Benrath became a part of D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n== Benrath today ==\n\nBenrath is in the South of D\u00fcsseldorf. It has an area of 5.90 km2 and 15,900 inhabitants.

It is also called maken-machen-line, since south of it speakers say machen and north of it maken, as is described in the High German consonant shift.\n\n\n== The Benrath Castle ==\n\nThe Schloss Benrath (Benrath Castle) is one of the greatest baroque castles in Germany. The castle contains a museum.\nThe park of the castle is very famous, too.\n\n\n== Regular events ==\n\n\n=== August ===\nSchloss concerts\nBier Boerse!\n\n\n=== October ===\nSecond Sunday: Light procession through the park of the castle around the Spiegelweiher with the \"Black Madonna of Benrath\"\n\n\n=== November and December ===\nAdvent market and Christmas market\n\n\n== Schools ==\n\nAnnette-von-Droste-H\u00fclshoff-Gymnasium\nSchlo\u00df-Gymnasium Benrath\nRealschule Benrath\nCommon Hauptschule Benrath,\nCatholic Grundschule:\nSt.-C\u00e4cilia-School\nCatholic Grundschule Einsiedelstra\u00dfe,\nCommon Grundschule Erich-M\u00fcller-Stra\u00dfe\n\n\n== Sports associations ==\nTSG Benrath 1881 e.V.\nRuder-Gesellschaft Benrath 1908 e.V.\nSportgemeinschaft Benrath-Hassels 1910/12 e.V.\nTennisclub Benrath 1912 e.V.\nVfL Benrath 06 e.V.\nSch\u00fctzenbruderschaft St. C\u00e4cilia Benrath e.V. von 1553\nDEC Devils e.V. \u2013 women icehockey in D\u00fcsseldorf\n\n\n== Sports venues ==\nSparkassen-Eissporthalle (Sparkasse skating arena), foundation of the Stadtsparkasse D\u00fcsseldorf (Savings and loan association D\u00fcsseldorf), Paulsm\u00fchlenstra\u00dfe 6\n\n\n== Personalities ==\nHarry Piel, German film director and actor\nKarl Hohmann, German national football team player\nWilliam, Prince of Hohenzollern, head of the house Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen (1905\u20131927)\n\n\n== Trails ==\nIn Benrath begin resp. end the following marked trails of the Sauerl\u00e4ndischer Gebirgsverein (SGV.

        "wiki": "D\u00fcsseldorf (often Dusseldorf in English sources; UK: , US: , German: [\u02c8d\u028fsl\u0329d\u0254\u0281f] (listen);  Low Franconian and Ripuarian: D\u00fcsseld\u00f6rp ([\u02c8d\u028fsl\u0329d\u0153\u0250\u032fp]); archaic Dutch: Dusseldorp) is the capital and second-largest city of the most populous German state of North Rhine-Westphalia after Cologne, and the seventh-largest city in Germany, with a population of 617,280. At the confluence of the Rhine and its tributary D\u00fcssel, the city lies in the centre of both the Rhine-Ruhr and the Rhineland Metropolitan Regions with the Cologne Bonn Region to its south and the Ruhr to its north. Most of the city lies on the right bank of the Rhine (as opposed to Cologne, whose city centre lies on the river's left bank). The city is the largest in the German Low Franconian dialect area (closely related to Dutch). \"Dorf\" meaning \"village\" in German, the \"-dorf\" suffix (English cognate: thorp) is unusual in the German-speaking area for a settlement of D\u00fcsseldorf's size.\nMercer's 2012 Quality of Living survey ranked D\u00fcsseldorf the sixth most livable city in the world. D\u00fcsseldorf Airport is Germany's third-busiest airport after those of Frankfurt and Munich, serving as the most important international airport for the inhabitants of the densely populated Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area. D\u00fcsseldorf is an international business and financial centre, renowned for its fashion and trade fairs, and is headquarters to one Fortune Global 500 and two DAX companies. Messe D\u00fcsseldorf organises nearly one fifth of premier trade shows. As second largest city of the Rhineland, D\u00fcsseldorf holds Rhenish Carnival celebrations every year in February/March, the D\u00fcsseldorf carnival celebrations being the third most popular in Germany after those held in Cologne and Mainz.There are 22 institutions of higher education in the city including the Heinrich-Heine-Universit\u00e4t D\u00fcsseldorf, the university of applied sciences (Hochschule D\u00fcsseldorf), the academy of arts (Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf) (Joseph Beuys, Emanuel Leutze, August Macke, Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, and Andreas Gursky), and the university of music (Robert-Schumann-Musikhochschule D\u00fcsseldorf). The city is also known for its pioneering influence on electronic/experimental music (Kraftwerk) and its Japanese community.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early development ===\nWhen the Roman Empire was strengthening its position throughout Europe, a few Germanic tribes clung on in marshy territory off the eastern banks of the Rhine. In the 7th and 8th centuries, the odd farming or fishing settlement could be found at the point where the small river D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine. It was from such settlements that the city of D\u00fcsseldorf grew.\n\nThe first written mention of D\u00fcsseldorf (then called Dusseldorp in the local Low Rhenish dialect) dates back to 1135. Under Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa the small town of Kaiserswerth to the north of D\u00fcsseldorf became a well-fortified outpost, where soldiers kept a watchful eye on every movement on the Rhine. Kaiserswerth eventually became a suburb of D\u00fcsseldorf in 1929. In 1186, D\u00fcsseldorf came under the rule of the Counts of Berg. 14 August 1288 is one of the most important dates in the history of D\u00fcsseldorf. On this day the sovereign Count Adolf VIII of Berg granted the village on the banks of the D\u00fcssel town privileges. Before this, a bloody struggle for power had taken place between the Archbishop of Cologne and the count of Berg, culminating in the Battle of Worringen.\n\nThe Archbishop of Cologne's forces were wiped out by the forces of the count of Berg who were supported by citizens and farmers of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf, paving the way for D\u00fcsseldorf's elevation to city status, which is commemorated today by a monument on the Burgplatz. The custom of turning cartwheels is credited to the children of D\u00fcsseldorf. There are variations of the origin of the cartwheeling children. Today the symbol (Der Radschl\u00e4ger) represents the story and every year the D\u00fcsseldorfers celebrate by having a cartwheeling contest. After this battle the relationship between the four cities deteriorated, because they were commercial rivals; it is often said that there is a kind of hostility between the citizens of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf. Today, it finds its expression mainly in a humorous form (especially during the Rhineland Karneval) and in sports.A market square sprang up on the banks of the Rhine and the square was protected by city walls on all four sides. In 1380, the dukes of Berg moved their seat to the town and D\u00fcsseldorf was made regional capital of the Duchy of Berg. During the following centuries several famous landmarks were built, including the Collegiate Church of St Lambertus. In 1609, the ducal line of the United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg died out, and after a virulent struggle over succession, J\u00fclich and Berg fell to the Wittelsbach Counts of Palatinate-Neuburg, who made D\u00fcsseldorf their main domicile, even after they inherited the Electorate of the Palatinate, in 1685, becoming now Prince-electors as Electors Palatine.Under the art-loving Johann Wilhelm II (r. 1690\u20131716), a vast art gallery with a huge selection of paintings and sculptures, were housed in the Stadtschloss (city castle). After his death, the city fell on hard times again, especially after Elector Charles Theodore inherited Bavaria and moved the electoral court to Munich. With him he took the art collection, which became part of what is now the Alte Pinakothek in Munich. Destruction and poverty struck D\u00fcsseldorf after the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon made Berg a Grand Duchy and D\u00fcsseldorf its capital. Johann Devaranne, a leader of Solingen's resistance to Napoleon's conscription decrees, was executed here in 1813. After Napoleon's defeat, the whole Rhineland including Berg was given to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815. The Rhine Province's parliament was established in D\u00fcsseldorf. By the mid-19th century, D\u00fcsseldorf enjoyed a revival thanks to the Industrial Revolution as the city boasted 100,000 inhabitants by 1882; the figure doubled in 1892.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nDuring World War I the Royal Naval Air Service (RNS) undertook the first Entente strategic bombing missions on 22 September 1914, when it bombed the Zeppelin bases in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\nIn 1920, D\u00fcsseldorf became the centre of the General Strike. On 15 April 1920, 45 delegates of the German Miners Union were murdered by the Freikorps.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nThe city was a target of strategic bombing during World War II, particularly during the RAF bombing campaign in 1943 when over 700 bombers were used in a single night. Raids continued late into the war. As part of the campaign against German oil facilities, the RAF raid of 20\u201321 February on the Rhenania Ossag refinery in the Reisholz district of the city halted oil production there. The Allied ground advance into Germany reached D\u00fcsseldorf in mid-April 1945. The United States 97th Infantry Division easily captured the city on 18 April 1945, after the local German Resistance group launched Aktion Rheinland.\n\n\n=== German Federal Republic ===\nIn 1946, D\u00fcsseldorf was made capital of the new federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The city's reconstruction proceeded at a frantic pace and the economic transformation guided D\u00fcsseldorf's economic growth.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Physical geography ===\n\nD\u00fcsseldorf lies at the centre of the Lower Rhine basin, where the delta of the D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine. The city lies on the east side of the Rhine, except District 4 (Oberkassel, Niederkassel, Heerdt and L\u00f6rick).\nAcross the Rhine, the city of Neuss stands on the delta of the Erft. D\u00fcsseldorf lies southwest of the Ruhr urban area, and in the middle of the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region.\nD\u00fcsseldorf is built entirely on alluvium, mud, sand, clay and occasionally gravel. The highest point in D\u00fcsseldorf is the top of Sandberg in the far eastern part of the city (Hubbelrath borough) at 165 metres (541 ft). The lowest point is at the far northern end in Wittlaer borough where the Schwarzbach enters the Rhine, with an average elevation of 28 metres (92 ft).\n\n\n=== Adjacent cities and districts ===\nThe following districts and cities border D\u00fcsseldorf (clockwise starting from the north): the City of Duisburg, the District of Mettmann (Ratingen, Mettmann, Erkrath, Hilden, Langenfeld, and Monheim), and the District of Neuss (Dormagen, Neuss, and Meerbusch).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe city has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb, mild in relation to East Germany). Like the rest of the lower Rhineland, D\u00fcsseldorf experiences moderate winters with little snowfall and mild to warm summers. The average annual temperature is 10.6 \u00b0C (51 \u00b0F) with an average yearly precipitation of 797 millimetres (31 in). The dominant wind direction is from the west with velocities in the range of 3 to 4 m/s (7\u20139 mph), with gusts of 3.5 \u22124.8 m/s (8\u201310.7 mph). The wind is calm (defined as being under 2 m/s or 4.5 mph) about 35% of the time, more frequently at night and in the winter.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nWith a population of 612,178 within the city boundaries (31 December 2015), D\u00fcsseldorf is Germany's seventh largest city. Its population surpassed the threshold of 100,000 inhabitants during the height of industrialisation in 1882, and peaked at just over 705,000 in 1962. The city then began to lose residents with many moving into neighbouring municipalities. However, since the late 1990s, the city's population has been slowly rising again.\nA total of 109,883 (18%) of D\u00fcsseldorf's population are foreigners (31 December 2008), the majority of whom come from within Europe (81,742). The largest national minorities are Turks, Greeks, and Poles. D\u00fcsseldorf and its surroundings have the third-largest Japanese community in Europe and the largest in Germany (about 11,000 people). D\u00fcsseldorf has the third-largest Jewish community in Germany, with about 7,000 members.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Mayors ===\n\n\n=== Districts ===\n\nSince 1975, D\u00fcsseldorf is divided into ten administrative districts. Each district (Bezirk) has its own elected district council (Bezirksvertretung) and its own district mayor (Bezirksvorsteher). The district councils are advisory only. Each district is further subdivided into boroughs. There are 50 boroughs in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nD\u00fcsseldorf has become one of the top telecommunications centres in Germany. With two of the four big German providers of mobile frequencies, D2 Vodafone and E-Plus, D\u00fcsseldorf leads the German mobile phone market. There are many foreign information and communication technology companies in D\u00fcsseldorf such as Huawei, NTT, Ericsson, Nokia, and GTS.. There are 18 internet service providers located in the capital of North-Rhine Westphalia. There are two airlines with headquarters in the city: Eurowings and formerly independent LTU International.Many of the internet companies in D\u00fcsseldorf have their roots in the world of advertising: there are 400 advertising agencies in D\u00fcsseldorf, among them three of the largest in Germany: BBDO Group, Grey Global Group and Publicis.

Heinrich Heine, whose 200th birthday was celebrated in 1997 and who originally had a proposed memorial in the city dedicated to him; Clara and Robert Schumann; and as Felix Mendelssohn, are the most prominent artists related to the city, which is home to a distinguished Academy of Fine Arts.\nThe D\u00fcsseldorf cultural scene comprises traditional and avant-garde, classical and glamorous. The world-famous state art collection of North Rhine-Westphalia, the highly acclaimed Deutsche Oper am Rhein (opera), and the D\u00fcsseldorfer Schauspielhaus (theatre), artistic home of Gustaf Gr\u00fcndgens, are major elements of D\u00fcsseldorf's reputation as a centre of the fine arts.\n\n\n=== Beer ===\nD\u00fcsseldorf is well known for its Altbier, a hoppy beer which translates as old [style] beer, a reference to the pre-lager brewing method of using a warm top-fermenting yeast like British pale ales. Over time the Alt yeast adjusted to lower temperatures, and the Alt brewers would store or lager the beer after fermentation, leading to a cleaner, crisper beer. The name \"altbier\" first appeared in the 19th century to differentiate the beers of D\u00fcsseldorf from the new pale lager that was gaining a hold on Germany.Brewers in D\u00fcsseldorf used the pale malts that were used for the modern pale lagers, but retained the old (\"alt\") method of using warm fermenting yeasts. The first brewery to use the name Alt was Schumacher which opened in 1838. The founder, Mathias Schumacher, allowed the beer to mature in cool conditions in wooden casks for longer than normal, and laid the foundation for the modern alt \u2013 amber coloured and lagered. The result is a pale beer that has some of the lean dryness of a lager but with fruity notes as well.There are five pub-breweries in D\u00fcsseldorf which brew Altbier on the premises: F\u00fcchschen, Schumacher, Schl\u00fcssel, Uerige and Brauerei K\u00fcrzer. Four of the five are in the historic centre of D\u00fcsseldorf (Altstadt); the other (Schumacher), between the Altstadt and D\u00fcsseldorf Central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), also maintains an establishment in the Altstadt, Im Goldenen Kessel, across the street from Schl\u00fcssel.\nEach (except Brauerei K\u00fcrzer) produces a special, secret, seasonal \"Sticke\" version in small quantities, though the names vary: Schl\u00fcssel spells it \"Stike\", without the \"c\", while Schumacher calls its special beer \"Latzenbier\", meaning \"slat beer\", possibly because the kegs from which it was poured had been stored on raised shelves. F\u00fcchschen's seasonal is its Weihnachtsbier (Christmas beer), available in bottles starting mid-November, and served in the brewpub on Christmas Eve.\n\n\n=== Music and nightlife ===\n\nSince the 1950s the \"Kom(m)\u00f6dchen\" has been one of the most prominent political cabarets of Germany. The city's most famous contribution to the culture of modern popular music is beyond doubt the influential avant-garde electronic band Kraftwerk. Formed by a few D\u00fcsseldorf-born musicians, Kraftwerk is internationally known as the most significant band in the history of post-war German music and as pioneers in electronic music. Other influential musical groups originating from D\u00fcsseldorf include Neu!, formed in 1971 by Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother, after their split from Kraftwerk, and La D\u00fcsseldorf, also formed by Dinger in 1976 shortly after Neu! disbanded. Both groups had a significant influence on a variety of subsequent rock, post-punk, and electronic music artists.Internationally known power metal band Warlock was formed in D\u00fcsseldorf in 1982. Its frontwoman, Doro Pesch, had a successful solo career in Europe and Asia since Warlock ended. The punk band Die Toten Hosen, which is famous around the world, also the most popular singers in Germany Westernhagen and Heino come from D\u00fcsseldorf. The electronic act D.A.F. was formed in the city in 1978, as well as the electronic/industrial pioneers Die Krupps in 1980. Another famous formation is Fehlfarben. Founded in the late 1970s by Peter Hein, Frank Fenstermacher, Kurt Dahlke and Michael Kemner.\nD\u00fcsseldorf appears in several songs, including D\u00fcsseldorf by the British indie band Teleman and W\u00e4rst du doch in D\u00fcsseldorf geblieben by Danish singer Dorthe Kollo.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nD\u00fcsseldorf, Germany is the fashion capital of Germany as it is a major cultural center for the art and fashion scenes. The fashionable clothes trend took root in this city before 1949. 1949 is the date of the first fashion show staged in D\u00fcsseldorf. Fashion trends have occurred as access to more elegant clothing for the general public has been a part of the culture for almost a century. Two times a year an event called the, \u201cVoices of Fashion,\u201d occurs and attracts many people to visit D\u00fcsseldorf to find the latest fashion items. There are famous designers that have made a name for themselves in D\u00fcsseldorf as well. Designers Sabine Schumacher, Peter O. Mahler, and Renate Harvan all design in D\u00fcsseldorf. To keep the creativity and passion for fashion alive in D\u00fcsseldorf everyday there are schools dedicated to fashion design in D\u00fcsseldorf as well. Akademie Mode and Design Institution, Design Department Academy, and Mode Design College are the three prominent fashion schools residing in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n=== Carnival ===\n\nOne of the biggest cultural events in D\u00fcsseldorf is the Karneval (also referred to as the \"fifth season\") which starts every year on 11 November at 11:11 a.m., and reaches its climax on Rosenmontag (Rose Monday), featuring a huge parade through the streets of D\u00fcsseldorf. Karneval ends on Aschermittwoch (Ash Wednesday).\n\n\n=== Cartwheeler of D\u00fcsseldorf ===\n\nThe D\u00fcsseldorfer Radschl\u00e4ger (Boy who does Cartwheels) is said to be the city's oldest tradition. The symbol of the cartwheeler can be found on many souvenirs and various things in D\u00fcsseldorf have the cartwheelers to thank for their names. This tradition was honoured in 1954 by the erection of a fountain, called Cartwheeler's Fountain, on the Burgplatz in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n==== Legends of its origin and history ====\nThe tradition cannot be linked to one specific historical event, instead, there are several stories surrounding the beginnings of the D\u00fcsseldorf Cartwheelers. Probably the most well known version is Battle of Worringen. In the battle of 1288 Count Adolf devastatingly defeated the Archbishop of Cologne. As a consequence of this victory, D\u00fcsseldorf obtained Town privileges. The inhabitants, especially the children ran joyfully on the streets and performed cartwheels.\nAnother story talks about a wedding procession during which one of the wheels of the wedding carriage broke. In order to fend off the threat of bad luck, a boy supposedly jumped to the carriage, took hold of the wheel and thus became a living part of the wheel. Whether the story is about the marriage of Jan Wellem and Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici or the wedding of Margravine Jakobea of Baden and Johann Wilhelm is debatable.\nAnother story gives an account of this wedding between Margrave Jacobe von Baden and Johann Wilhelm, in 1585. According to legend she felt miserable about her marriage, but the cartwheelers who displayed their skills next to her carriage were able to make her smile. Numerous travelers were attracted to the city by great exhibitions \u2013 the forerunner of today's fairs \u2013 between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. During this time the children who did the cart wheeling found out that it was a profitable source of income. The bourgeoisie accepted this in good humour as a symbolic act of local patriotism. In the beginning the lads shouted \"f\u00f6r eene Penning schlage ich das Rad\u201c (cartwheel for a penny). The Jan Wellem monument returned to D\u00fcsseldorf at the end of the Second World War. The procession was accompanied by torches, fanfares and the cartwheeling boys.\n\n\n===== Cartwheelers in the cityscape =====\nCartwheelers can be found by several fountains within the city and near many small landmarks. The most famous is Cartwheeler's Fountain in Burgplatz with an inscription of a quote by Hans M\u00fcller-Schl\u00f6sser: \"Radschl\u00e4ger wolle mer blieve, wie jeck et de Minschen och drieve\u201c (We will always remain cartwheelers, however crazy it drives people.) The fountain was designed by Alfred Zschorsch in 1954 and donated by the  Heimatverein D\u00fcsseldorfer Jonges, which is a club devoted to the maintenance of local and regional traditions. There are other cartwheelers that decorate storm drains and the door knocker on the Church of Lambertus, which was designed by Friedrich Becker. He created the cartwheeler in front of the Schadow Arcades.This tradition has been kept alive by the Alde D\u00fcsseldorfer B\u00fcrgergesellschaft von 1920 e. V., a society founded in 1920, who organized the first cartwheeler competition on 17 October 1937. Since 1971 this event has been held annually in cooperation with the Stadtsparkasse (a local bank), but formerly took place in the K\u00f6nigsallee. Since 2006 it has taken place on the Rheinwerft, near the old part of town. This is a fixed date in the city\u2019s calendar of events. About 500 boys regularly participate in this event and since 1971 girls have also taken part. In 2001 the art project Radschl\u00e4ger-Kunst (Cartwheeler Art) was called into life, in which over 100 cartwheeler sculptures have been designed by various artists. The door knocker on the Church of Lambertus functioned as a model for the sculptures that are 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) high, 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) wide and 30 cm (12 in) deep. They were positioned around the city centre. Some of the sculptures have been auctioned off to companies and private owners.\n\n\n=== Christmas market ===\nEvery Christmas, the city of D\u00fcsseldorf uses the city centre to host one of the largest Christmas gatherings in Germany. The Christmas festival occurs every year from 17 November until 23 December. This Christmas fest brings D\u00fcsseldorf a large portion of tourism every year as many people from nearby areas come to the city to drink mulled wine and hot chocolate and watch craftsman blow glass and create art. The event contains many small wooden buildings all clustered in the middle of the city for all the citizens to enjoy. The event, to many visitors, has an old European feel, but is very lively.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nTraditional meals in the region are Rheinischer Sauerbraten (a beef roast and sometimes horse marinated for a few days in vinegar and spices served with gravy and raisins) and Heaven and Earth (Himmel und \u00c4d; black pudding with stewed apples mixed with mashed potatoes).

Also a special meal: D\u00fcsseldorfer Senfrostbraten (Steaks roasted with D\u00fcsseldorf mustard on top).\nD\u00fcsseldorf is known for its strong Dijon-like mustard served in a traditional pot called \"Mostertp\u00f6ttche\", which was eternalised in a still life by Vincent van Gogh in 1884.The Rhine Metropolis is one of the most diverse areas in terms of culinary diversity.

        "wiki": "Merkur Spielarena (stylized as MERKUR SPIEL-ARENA), known previously as the \"ESPRIT arena\" (until 2 August 2018), the \"LTU Arena\" (until June 2009), and as the \"D\u00fcsseldorf Arena\" (during the 2011 Eurovision Song Contest), is a multi-functional football stadium in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany. The stadium holds 54,600 and has a closable roof. Its special heating system allows the stadium to host comfortable events at the height of winter.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nConstruction of the stadium began in 2002 and was completed in 2004. It was built to replace the former Rheinstadion at the same site near the river Rhine. The structure's initial seating capacity of 51,500 was expanded in summer 2010 when some seating areas were converted into standing terraces. The arena currently hosts association football team Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf (currently in the first division, the Bundesliga).\n\n\n== Sports events ==\n\n\n=== International football matches ===\nWhile the Arena was not one of the venues for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, it has hosted several international matches since it opened.\nThe first international match in the Arena was an international friendly between Germany and Argentina on 9 February 2005, ending in a 2\u20132 draw. On 7 February 2007, Germany played their second international friendly in the Arena, beating Switzerland 3\u20131. In their third international friendly in the Arena, on 11 February 2009, Germany suffered a 1\u20130 defeat to Norway.\nThe Arena also hosted two international friendlies of the Portugal national football team. In Portugal's first international friendly in the Arena, on 1 March 2006, they recorded a 3\u20130 win over Saudi Arabia. On 26 March 2008, Portugal played their second international friendly in the Arena, suffering a 2\u20131 defeat to Greece national football team.\n\n\n=== Other sports events ===\nThe stadium was the former home of the Rhein Fire of NFL Europe, an American football league. They were tenants for their final three seasons from 2005 to 2007. The stadium hosted World Bowl XIII and XIV. Esprit Arena hosted the Race of Champions 2010, with notable drivers such as Michael Schumacher, Sebastian Vettel, Alain Prost and S\u00e9bastien Loeb.\nThe Esprit Arena was the host venue for boxing world heavyweight championship bouts: between Wladimir Klitschko and Eddie Chambers on 20 March 2010 (Klitschko won the bout by KO in the 12th round), Wladimir Klitschko against Jean-Marc Mormeck on 3 March 2012 (Klitschko won by KO in the 4th round), Wladimir Klitschko against Tyson Fury on 28 November 2015 (see Wladimir Klitschko vs. Tyson Fury (Fury won by a unanimous points decision)).\n\n\n== Music events ==\nGerman Singer Herbert Gr\u00f6nemeyer opened the arena with two concerts on 7 and 8 January 2005 as conclusion of his Mensch-Tour. On 8 June 2011 he returned with his Schiffsverkehr Tour.\nThe German rock band Die Toten Hosen, which is based in D\u00fcsseldorf, gave a total of three concerts in the arena.

          "I have brought my 3.5 year old son here since he was 1 year old. He loves looking a the animals. The open reindeer area is fantastic. You can bring apples and carrots or oats to fee them by hand. My son absolutely loves this experience and it helps build confidence and encourage",

          "Very pretty park with some good walks and a variety of animals to see. My kids enjoyed the information lodge where they learned about woodland animals (and got warm). Would be nice on a warm day, great for a picnic. Reasonable good play park for the kids.",
          "It's a long walk to get here from the nearest station, but worth it. Beautiful place to be with nature, Take some fruit with you so that you can feed the animals. The animals are friendly and are happy. It's not a zoo, but a wildlife park.",

          "The park is among my most favorite places in the area - it is a nice and small walk (the Wildpark itself is only 2-3 km from beginning to end, the area around it is much bigger) where you can see a few wild animals. The park has no entrance charge and is normally open until 6",

          "We decided to visit the wild park during our one day visit to D\u00fcsseldorf as we expected it will be fun for kids, and we were right. Although because of winter time some of the animals were not showing. The kids had the chance to get very close to the dears and feed them. The",
          "It was one of the best place for our 3 children during our holiday. All the animals are very friendly and we love them:) don't forget to take some vegetables and fruits with you.",
          "I personally never had such close contact with deers. It was amazing, they were so close to us and in fact i feed them some grass from my hand. It was a different experience. Just cant explain in words",
          "I found my way to the wildpark by chance when I was taking a walk around the city. There is no entry to this place which is cool especially because it's a very well maintained beautiful place and you will find animals and areas for games or simply to sit down and let nature sink",
          "I hate zoos and I love animals. Wildpark proved to be the anti zoo and a wonderful natural setting just to be another animal hanging out with my animal friends. I went on a partly rainy day in November, so this was the ultimate test. I rode the streetcar from the main station",
          "Went here as a spur of the moment thing, it was wonderful!! So easy to get too and open from 9-5 we only spent 1.5 hours here but managed to feed the animals, the deer were adorable, although they were shy, however a handful of oats and apple made them very happy!! Remember to",

          "Deer, wild pigs, raccoons, fox and more deer! You can feed the deer acorns you find on the ground or if you're able, bring apples to share with them. The park is fun, too. In the center there's a small herd of deer that will come up to share your snacks. Great outing with kids.",
          "Easily accessed by train from Dusseldorf centre. Lots of different animals such as goats, birds, wildcats, deer (which are very tame and approachable by visitors). Would suggest bringing a bag of apples as there is no shop, but a visitor centre if you need to shelter from the",

          "This is a bit outside of Dusseldorf but we were able to take some trains to get there. Once there we had about a 20 minute walk to get to the park, but it was on this nice tree lined path that was very scenic. Once there we walked around the park and saw the animals that were",
          "We hired bikes and set off from Dusseldorf. It took us about 45 mins to find the park. Not too many animals were on view, and some advertised were actually stuffed. This is a great place for children to interact with the deer. Take some shredded apple or carrot with you. We",

          "Amazing for kids, they are so happy to be able to touch and feed the reindeers. Only apples are allowed to be fed, so don\u00b4t take carrots, bread, or cereals. Of course, there are people doing that, but respecting the animals and the ones caring for them, was a starting point of",

          "Exceptional and vast park. Beautiful landscapes, valleys and vegetation. Great variety and numbers of wild animals such as several kinds of deer and wild boars. Also birds, wild cats, raccoons, ferrets, rams and other.. A very good move on behalf of the management was the free",
          "We love this place, clean and well organised it is so nice to see the deer roaming in the huge enclosures. The wild boar are a must-see too. The forest around is lovely to walk in, too. There is a toilet block in the deer park but we haven't found anywhere to buy food so take",

          "Not recommended to go during hot weather as the animals stay in the shadow; but overall experience for my family was nice as there are many beautiful walking trails and peaceful surrounding",
          "A great place to walk around , touch & feed the Deer. Better to go in the morning when they are still not full with foods given by many visitors. Carrot cut into pieces might be more natural expected food. I have seen however few of them like cereals ;) It's a free entrance park",
          "Nice, tidy and free park which is easily accessible using all sorts of transportation including the trams.",
          "Walked to the wildpark from the city centre (bus is advisable if long walks are a no go) and it took around 1.5 hours though going at a stroll. Took a while to find but was enjoyable for the time we were there, especially considering it is free. Deer come and eat from your hand",
          "Nice and well organized but expected to find more variety of animals. Far cry from a wild park. It can be a park for deers and some other small animals. A Local wild park!! Do not expect much. The exhibition is mediocre And is not tourist friendly.",
          "Unfortunately my hometown lost its zoo at the end of WW2, so the Wildpark is the only place in town for kids and even visitors from abroad to see some life deer and (fenced) wild-boar. And if you can spare some apples or noodles, the animals will love it to be feeded. It's real",

          "The deer made the Wildpark for us, the fact that you could feed them was a fantastic experience. Also both parking and entry were free which was a pleasant surprise :)",
          "Really fun afternoon. Take some fruit and veg from the market, carrots are great, the deer also like nuts. Can be difficult to get too, easiest way is to take a car. We took a train into to the old town, then a couple of trams. It's a short walk of around 20 minutes from there",
          "It was a wonderful decision to go to this place while staying at Dusseldorf. The park is open for all and provision is made for each age group to come and enjoy at this natural habitat of many wild life animals. There are quite good variety of animals in the park. The park is",

        "wiki": "Kaiserswerth is one of the oldest parts of the City of D\u00fcsseldorf. It is in the north of the city and next to the river Rhine. It houses the Deaconess's Institute of Kaiserswerth where Florence Nightingale worked \nKaiserswerth has about 7,000 inhabitants and an area of 4.71 km2.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAbout the year 700 the monk Saint Suitbert founded a Benedictine abbey at Werth, a river island that formed an important crossing point of the Rhine. The abbey was destroyed 88 years later. On that area there is now the \"Erzbisch\u00f6fliches Suitbertus-Gymnasium\", an archiepiscopal secondary school with the old chapel and parts of the abbey. The former monastery garden is a meeting point for the upper school between lesson times.\nThe Kaiserpfalz which is a general term for a temporary seat of the Holy Roman Emperor was built at an unknown date but before the year 1016.\nIn 1062, the archbishop of Cologne, Anno II, kidnapped the underage German King Heinrich IV from here and in this way obtained the unofficial regency of the Holy Roman Empire. At this time the island's name changed from Werth to Kaiserswerth. In 1174, Friederick I Barbarossa moved the Rhine customs collection to Kaiserswerth. The eastern branch of the Rhine around the island silted up connecting Kaiserswerth to the east bank of the river. In 1273, the emperor pledged Kaiserswerth to the Archbishop of Cologne forming a de facto enclave within the Duchy of J\u00fclich-Berg. In 1591, Friedrich Spee von Langenfeld was born in Kaiserswerth.\n\nDue to its strategic position the town changed regularly. The town was captured in 1586 during the Cologne War, and then occupied by the Spanish from 1589 to 1592. In 1636 the town was captured again by the forces of Hesse. When in 1688 the Elector of Cologne made an alliance with Louis XIV during the War of the Grand Alliance he gave the French access to the Rhine crossing at Kaiserswerth. This caused the Dutch and Brandenburg to lay siege to the town in the June 1689. The French garrison surrendered at the end of the month when their supplies were destroyed by fire. The French reoccupied Kaiserswerth in 1701 during the War of the Spanish Succession and the Allies laid siege to it again in 1702. After a long and hard struggle the town surrendered and the Alliance decided to demolish the fortifications.In the 19th century Kaiserswerth was chiefly noted for its deaconess clinic, founded by local pastor Theodor Fliedner. Florence Nightingale worked there for some months meeting Paulina Irby. Another noted student was the Swedish Maria Cederschi\u00f6ld, a pioneer of nursing in her country.In both World Wars there was a great military hospital in Kaiserswerth.\nKaiserswerth became a part of D\u00fcsseldorf in 1929.\n\n\n== Art in Kaiserswerth ==\n\nSince 2001 an old school is home to the \u2033Kaiserswerth art archive\u2033 (Kunstarchiv Kaiserswerth). Under the roof of Museum Kunstpalast the archive presents works of the collector Volker Kahmen, which mainly contains paintings by Bruno Goller who was Professor of the Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf, and works of the photo-artists Bernd and Hilla Becher with their pioneering photography. In 2014 the sculptor Peter Schwickerath created the sculpture \u2033Im Kontext\u2033 situated next to the Ruin of the Kaiserpfalz.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\nKaiserswerth is connected to the central stations and the central districts of the cities of D\u00fcsseldorf and Duisburg by the metropolitan railway line U 79. There are some bus lines to other parts of D\u00fcsseldorf, to Mettmann, Krefeld, Ratingen and D\u00fcsseldorf Airport.\nThere is a ferry crossing the Rhine over to Meerbusch\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nChrista-Maria Zimmermann / Hans St\u00f6cker (Hrsg.), Edmund Spohr: Kayserswerth, 1300 Jahre, Heilige, Kaiser, Reformer.

          "Ancient ruins form the tenth century lying along the Rhine river, which give a good impression on how the old Roman royals lived in their palace. Mind boggling that these walls are still standing - how strong the architecture was on those days! The walk up to there is so",
          "Worth visiting these ruins adjacent to the river Rhine. My grandson loved scrambling up and down the buildings with his dad. Pleasant walk to the site adds to the enjoyment. A beer garden is next to the venue.",
          "These are wonderful castle ruins on the Rhine river and just a 15 minute tram ride outside of the city centre. There is a small perimeter fence stopping you getting inside and up close but it does not stop you from getting great photos. A great site to visit.",

          "We visited Kaiserwerth because of a recommendation from the tourist info centre as we were looking for somewhere close to Dusseldorf to pass a couple of hours. The town was quite small and easy to walk around. The journey took around 30 minutes from the centre and was worth the",

          "Forgot to check whether the ruins were open during winter, it is not. This is a peaceful haven. We walked around a bit, and explored the village. I like what one TA member suggested. Take U79 and get off at Kittelbachstrasse. Explore the village and you will end up a bit",
          "This location is special: you are not far away from a big business city sitting outside nearby the riverside, you may even enjoy sundowners, big trees protect you from the sun, you just get some rest have a good drink, snack some stuff or dine in the restaurant inside. But you",

          "Not much else to see in this little part of D\u00fcsseldorf but he ruins. We were there around 10 in the morning, with no other people there. I think I took pictures of every corner of the ruins. They are enchanting. I imagine people walking around there ages ago and now I got to be",
          "It's a great option if you want to wander around Dusseldorf and see some history. It was initially built as a monastery, and it has gone through many owners and facts ever since. You will only see and walk around the ruins, but you can enjoy the walk alongside the Rhine and have",
          "It was a bit difficult to find this place after get off the train, but it was because I was looking for Kaiserswerth in Google Maps, and not Kaiserpfalz. You have to put Kaiserpfalz on Google Maps to find the place properly. It's really interesting to visit this ruins,",

We got off at Kittelbachstra\u00dfe stop and walked on a residential street and pathway to",

          "The castle ruins of the Kaiserpfalz are on the banks of the river Rhine. Amazingly old ruins from the 10th century. The site itself is not accessible beyond summer months, but it is worth visiting year around- weather permitting. Nice walk along the river and good restaurants",

          "I knew about this castle form the Hotel receptionist so we decided to go after a small tour in the city center and it wasn't so far by metro. If was hard for ur to reach it from the train station though, we walked around for a while until we found it finally. The castle is",
          "The ruins speak more than thousand words. Unless you come by bicycle parking will be tricky, but managable. You must not forget to spoil yourself to a homebrew in the ferry restaurant afterwards ;-)",

          "You have to use your imagination a fair bit at this castle, but if you can do this you will have fun exploring the ruins. There are a few signs to explain things, but not much. It is generally not busy so it is easy to imagine that you are the king of the castle!",
          "Located in the the North next to he river Rhinestone is the 1000 year old ruin of the Kaiserpfalz castle. Wonderful history and lots of little baroque houses to observe, we loved it.",

          "This Ruin has not much to offer unfortunately! It stands alone on the border of the Rhine. The story around is much more interesting, at least. Nice as a stop-by during an \"among river walk\".",
          "Kaiserpfalz Kaiserswerth makes a perfect stroll to take during the fall. Built by Emperor Barbarossa around 1184 and set in the changing colors of the leaves and right on the Rhine river, the majesty of these castle ruins is downright picturesque. Right next to it is a cute",
          "This is a fun free and historical area to check out. It doesn't take long to explore the ruins, but its nice. There is a really nice restaurant and bar with a great outdoor area overlooking the Rhein river next door. It's a really pretty bike ride there along the river from",
          "First let me say that be careful using Google maps to get there by public transit. I (and at least one other person I saw roaming around) got off at the wrong station according to Google maps. I don't remember the name of the stop you really want but it's right in the middle of",
          "My suggestion: take a boat up to Kaiserswerth from Dusseldorf, it is a great little trip. I don't remember the exact history of the ruins, but I love ruins so they are very cool. Right nearby there is a beautiful beer garden right by the river, and Kaiserswerth is a fine little",

          "Ok, first thing, don't make our mistake and get off at the Kaiserwerth Stra\u00dfe train stop. We wandered a bit before we figured it out. You can either get off at the Klemensplatz station or a stop earlier (if coming out from the city) at Kittelbachstra\u00dfe - I recommend",
          "Nice trip from the centre of dusseldorf and walk through this cute small town.Someone can see the ruins of Barbarossa 's imperial palace.A really pleasant and interesting day",
          "There's not a huge amount to see at the ruins but the town and promenade along the river are perfect for an afternoon trip. It took me 20 minutes on the tram from Duesseldorf centre (U79), and it felt like a different world. Lashings of old world charm and a thoroughly relaxing",
          "This is a really lovely day trip from the centre of Dusseldorf - take a really lovely boat trip for an hour up the Rhine, and walk through this charming small town full of cute shops and cafes before coming up the ruins. The history is clearly detailed, and you can spend a",
          "I took line U79 to Kaiserswerth - a pretty little town in Dussedolf. It has a nice little eating place just opposite the tram line. Crossing over and as you walk down the main street, you need to turn left at the Marketplaz street. Walk all the way towards the end, you will come",
          "Take the time to walk throughout these ruins and read all the plaques around the property! Don't forget to visit the parking lot where you can see where Elvis Presley parked and abandoned his Cadillac Fleetwood when visiting the area many years ago. Interesting cafe next door.",
          "Kaiserswerth is a beautiful spot to sit and relax along the Rhein River. The old castle itself is quite neat - open and free to the public. The old town is also quite a neat little place to stroll along.",
          "It's nice to get out of the center of D\u00fcsseldorf. We rode our bikes from the altstadt along the river and it was great! There is not much left of the castle, but it was just fun to venture out. If you're in the area, check it out, but don't go out of your way.",
          "Kaiserswerth has a long history! the Kaiserpfalz is a well restorated historic castle, but its only a small part of the highlights which Kaiserswerth offers to its visitors! -the historic village itselfs -the basilika -the restaurants (you have to go to the Burghof) -the",
          "The fortress is located by the river in a beautiful promenade. It is easily accessible by train. It is worth a visit if you like nature and history.",
          "This is a great spot just outside Dusseldorf city, yet reachable using the city U-bahn services. Kaiserpfalz is a 10-20 min walk from the tran . u-bahn station. But the walk is real nice. Also you will need to walk by the Rhine river to get to the old castle ruins, which makes",
          "Made my way here while my husband was at the big conference center. Had a nice walk along the river, checked out the ruins and went into some shops. Good way to spend a morning.",
          "The old building was closed off but walking around it along the Rhine was very pleasant. There are plaques to read for some info. Also exploring the little village was very nice. We stopped at a pub that served wonderful beer, wine and pizza-like rustic pies. We took a cab",
          "Have a walk through the village and have a visit to the Kaispfalz - located by the Rhine, it's just lovely.",
          "A walk in autumn as the sun set. A hot strudel with vanilla custard. Dining by fanlight...a lot of candlelight. Super colours.Peace. The Rhine. Boats. Relaxation",
          "Came here from Benrath and it's a nice quaint little town. Definitely worth the quick visit. Ruins can only be seen from a distance as it is protected.",

          "We have visited the town of Kaiserwerth twice and it is well worth the effort. The old palace is very interesting with plenty of information about its history on sight. It is also lovely to walk right alongside the Rhine down to the ferry crossing point and to watch the river",
          "The old castle is worth the time to walk through and along the tree lined lane. It is beautiful, but the gate is not always open causing viewers to look through the fence. The area is historic, beautiful and surrounded by a charming, old town. It is easy to get there from",
          "We love the ruin. Although it is small but it is something to see other than posh shopping in D\u00fcsseldorf. The area is also nice with cute old style houses that you rarely see, if not at all, in D\u00fcsseldorf. It takes a little walk from U train to get there but you would love the",

          "We wanted to go up to Kaiserswerth on the river, taking a boat from the quay in Dusseldorf, but unfortunately they weren't running on the day we went. However it's really easy to get there on the U-bahn, line 79 from the mainline station. The town has some really pretty old",
          "We found these ruins to be fabulous. Easy to access and lovely to explore and great views of the Rhine. The signs provide information in English which helped us enjoy this place even more. After exploring the castle ruins, the township is a wonderful place to explore as well",
          "The ruins are set romantically close to the banks of the Rhine. the information provided on the signs is also in English so it is helpful. Some great views. The river walk is being improved. Lovely quiet village setting. The nearby Burghof is very good for refreshments.",
          "there are no boat trips here any more which was very disappointing.. We had to take the U79 underground to get here. Most of it is overground and pleasant.It would have been more exciting with the boat trip. The little town is nice with plenty of good outside drinking places on",
          "Unbelievable. Picture a beautiful stroll through trees beside the Rhine, and suddenly these shocking castle ruines from around 1183 are open and undiscovered before your eyes. This is truly a remarkable and seemingly undiscovered blow-your-mind discovery. No one was there but",
          "I loved walking around these ruins. They are near the old area of Dusseldorf. If you walk not far from this location (maybe 1 mile...towards the old city area) there is a street that has a car covered in vines...it was owned by Elvis Presley and was left sitting at it's current",
          "T h e destination in the northern suburb of Kaiserswerth well worth a visit if you can spare some time to explore the well kept ruins of a fortress built some 1200 years ago by Emperor Barbarossa. The 'magic' is, if you take a river boat to get there. These serviced boats are",
          "It is a nice road along the Rhine to get to the ruins. Once you get there, you can climb up the stairs to get a higher view, but what you see is still the Rhine. The building itsefl is not that special either.",
          "A nice visit on a walk along the Rhine River. Kinda cool to see what had been there so long ago. The town of Kaiserswerth is a nice town to stroll through. Convenient to the U-Bahn. Good Italian restaurant in town was Casa Massimo. Very good pasta!",
          "Walking in kaiserwerth and then along the river is a great activity on a sunny afternoon. Stop here and enjoy these ruins before carrying on to have a drink at one of the river side bars.",
          "The ruins are not that spectacular, we have seen others, but the little commercial centre is so cute and the athmosphere is greatly authentic and idylic. A little far from D\u00fcsseldorf centre, around 40 minutes by S-bahn, but it was worth the ride, the way there was in itself",
          "Lovely ruins of a small castle in the pretty town of Kaiserswerth. The ferry journey there was a lot faster than the return, which took twice as long due to the current. A nice way to spend a few hours!",
          "These ruins in a park by the Rhine are definitely worth a short visit. They are free to get into, and the place is well signposted inside in German and English. The little village of Kaiserwerth next to it is lovely, we had a walk around. However, this is not a full day visit",
          "Lovely setting overlooking the river in a pretty little village on the edge of Dusseldorf. We travelled there by tram from the city centre but you can take a boat trip upto it. The ruined castle was interesting to visit and climb to the topfor a great view and there are lots of",
          "Nice castle ruins with signs that do a great job explaining the historic significance of the castle. On it's own, not sure I would make the trip to see it but if you want to walk around Kaiserswerth and eat lunch, visit a bier garten or walk along the Rhein, it would make a",

          "This 1000-year-old site on the banks of the Rhein is easily reached by U79 tram (about 20 minutes) from the centre of Duesseldorf. Or take an hour boat trip - which is more expensive but some have unlimited beer or wine! From the tram stop you walk through a pretty main",
          "In the medieval town of Kaiserswerth you will find these fabulous castle remains. Plenty of places to eat and drink around the castle. Biergarten along the Rhine. You must not forget the 10km cycle or jogging tour along the Rhine straight into the heart of the D\u00fcsseldorf",
          "another great way to experience history hands on, the Kaiserpfalz is an old ruin which can be explored by walking around it or climbing the steps of a 1000+ year old artifacts dating back to the roman age. Summertime is the best time to go as there are plenty of outdoor",

          "We got a boat from the Old Town to Kaiserswerth, it takes about an hour each way and costs 18EUR but you get free beer and wine so it pretty much pays for itself. The boat trip is lovely and you pass some lovely areas. Kaiserswerth itself is a small village and it is really",

          "Kaiserswerth is like a small village. Small shops, lots of old buildings, museums and churches. It is really nice to walk around there. Metro/bus stop is right before the market place. Some buildings can be visited. We had lunch at Galerie Burghof. Great food and not expensive.",
          "While in Dusseldorf, with limited time, we decided to take a short Rhine Cruise to Kaiserswerth-- a popular destination. The main goal of many passengers was to guzzle as much free beer as possible before having to get off the boat. The boat's staff were great. We got to"

We were with the dogs and found a dog friendly restaurant with a water bowl. Second time in a couple of days, I would still go back. The ruins of the palace are impressive to see. At sunset it was a beautiful walk.",

        "wiki": "D\u00fcsseldorf (often Dusseldorf in English sources; UK: , US: , German: [\u02c8d\u028fsl\u0329d\u0254\u0281f] (listen);  Low Franconian and Ripuarian: D\u00fcsseld\u00f6rp ([\u02c8d\u028fsl\u0329d\u0153\u0250\u032fp]); archaic Dutch: Dusseldorp) is the capital and second-largest city of the most populous German state of North Rhine-Westphalia after Cologne, and the seventh-largest city in Germany, with a population of 617,280. At the confluence of the Rhine and its tributary D\u00fcssel, the city lies in the centre of both the Rhine-Ruhr and the Rhineland Metropolitan Regions with the Cologne Bonn Region to its south and the Ruhr to its north. Most of the city lies on the right bank of the Rhine (as opposed to Cologne, whose city centre lies on the river's left bank). The city is the largest in the German Low Franconian dialect area (closely related to Dutch). \"Dorf\" meaning \"village\" in German, the \"-dorf\" suffix (English cognate: thorp) is unusual in the German-speaking area for a settlement of D\u00fcsseldorf's size.\nMercer's 2012 Quality of Living survey ranked D\u00fcsseldorf the sixth most livable city in the world. D\u00fcsseldorf Airport is Germany's third-busiest airport after those of Frankfurt and Munich, serving as the most important international airport for the inhabitants of the densely populated Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area. D\u00fcsseldorf is an international business and financial centre, renowned for its fashion and trade fairs, and is headquarters to one Fortune Global 500 and two DAX companies. Messe D\u00fcsseldorf organises nearly one fifth of premier trade shows. As second largest city of the Rhineland, D\u00fcsseldorf holds Rhenish Carnival celebrations every year in February/March, the D\u00fcsseldorf carnival celebrations being the third most popular in Germany after those held in Cologne and Mainz.There are 22 institutions of higher education in the city including the Heinrich-Heine-Universit\u00e4t D\u00fcsseldorf, the university of applied sciences (Hochschule D\u00fcsseldorf), the academy of arts (Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf) (Joseph Beuys, Emanuel Leutze, August Macke, Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, and Andreas Gursky), and the university of music (Robert-Schumann-Musikhochschule D\u00fcsseldorf). The city is also known for its pioneering influence on electronic/experimental music (Kraftwerk) and its Japanese community.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early development ===\nWhen the Roman Empire was strengthening its position throughout Europe, a few Germanic tribes clung on in marshy territory off the eastern banks of the Rhine. In the 7th and 8th centuries, the odd farming or fishing settlement could be found at the point where the small river D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine. It was from such settlements that the city of D\u00fcsseldorf grew.\n\nThe first written mention of D\u00fcsseldorf (then called Dusseldorp in the local Low Rhenish dialect) dates back to 1135. Under Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa the small town of Kaiserswerth to the north of D\u00fcsseldorf became a well-fortified outpost, where soldiers kept a watchful eye on every movement on the Rhine. Kaiserswerth eventually became a suburb of D\u00fcsseldorf in 1929. In 1186, D\u00fcsseldorf came under the rule of the Counts of Berg. 14 August 1288 is one of the most important dates in the history of D\u00fcsseldorf. On this day the sovereign Count Adolf VIII of Berg granted the village on the banks of the D\u00fcssel town privileges. Before this, a bloody struggle for power had taken place between the Archbishop of Cologne and the count of Berg, culminating in the Battle of Worringen.\n\nThe Archbishop of Cologne's forces were wiped out by the forces of the count of Berg who were supported by citizens and farmers of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf, paving the way for D\u00fcsseldorf's elevation to city status, which is commemorated today by a monument on the Burgplatz. The custom of turning cartwheels is credited to the children of D\u00fcsseldorf. There are variations of the origin of the cartwheeling children. Today the symbol (Der Radschl\u00e4ger) represents the story and every year the D\u00fcsseldorfers celebrate by having a cartwheeling contest. After this battle the relationship between the four cities deteriorated, because they were commercial rivals; it is often said that there is a kind of hostility between the citizens of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf. Today, it finds its expression mainly in a humorous form (especially during the Rhineland Karneval) and in sports.A market square sprang up on the banks of the Rhine and the square was protected by city walls on all four sides. In 1380, the dukes of Berg moved their seat to the town and D\u00fcsseldorf was made regional capital of the Duchy of Berg. During the following centuries several famous landmarks were built, including the Collegiate Church of St Lambertus. In 1609, the ducal line of the United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg died out, and after a virulent struggle over succession, J\u00fclich and Berg fell to the Wittelsbach Counts of Palatinate-Neuburg, who made D\u00fcsseldorf their main domicile, even after they inherited the Electorate of the Palatinate, in 1685, becoming now Prince-electors as Electors Palatine.Under the art-loving Johann Wilhelm II (r. 1690\u20131716), a vast art gallery with a huge selection of paintings and sculptures, were housed in the Stadtschloss (city castle). After his death, the city fell on hard times again, especially after Elector Charles Theodore inherited Bavaria and moved the electoral court to Munich. With him he took the art collection, which became part of what is now the Alte Pinakothek in Munich. Destruction and poverty struck D\u00fcsseldorf after the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon made Berg a Grand Duchy and D\u00fcsseldorf its capital. Johann Devaranne, a leader of Solingen's resistance to Napoleon's conscription decrees, was executed here in 1813. After Napoleon's defeat, the whole Rhineland including Berg was given to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815. The Rhine Province's parliament was established in D\u00fcsseldorf. By the mid-19th century, D\u00fcsseldorf enjoyed a revival thanks to the Industrial Revolution as the city boasted 100,000 inhabitants by 1882; the figure doubled in 1892.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nDuring World War I the Royal Naval Air Service (RNS) undertook the first Entente strategic bombing missions on 22 September 1914, when it bombed the Zeppelin bases in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\nIn 1920, D\u00fcsseldorf became the centre of the General Strike. On 15 April 1920, 45 delegates of the German Miners Union were murdered by the Freikorps.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nThe city was a target of strategic bombing during World War II, particularly during the RAF bombing campaign in 1943 when over 700 bombers were used in a single night. Raids continued late into the war. As part of the campaign against German oil facilities, the RAF raid of 20\u201321 February on the Rhenania Ossag refinery in the Reisholz district of the city halted oil production there. The Allied ground advance into Germany reached D\u00fcsseldorf in mid-April 1945. The United States 97th Infantry Division easily captured the city on 18 April 1945, after the local German Resistance group launched Aktion Rheinland.\n\n\n=== German Federal Republic ===\nIn 1946, D\u00fcsseldorf was made capital of the new federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The city's reconstruction proceeded at a frantic pace and the economic transformation guided D\u00fcsseldorf's economic growth.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Physical geography ===\n\nD\u00fcsseldorf lies at the centre of the Lower Rhine basin, where the delta of the D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine. The city lies on the east side of the Rhine, except District 4 (Oberkassel, Niederkassel, Heerdt and L\u00f6rick).\nAcross the Rhine, the city of Neuss stands on the delta of the Erft. D\u00fcsseldorf lies southwest of the Ruhr urban area, and in the middle of the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region.\nD\u00fcsseldorf is built entirely on alluvium, mud, sand, clay and occasionally gravel. The highest point in D\u00fcsseldorf is the top of Sandberg in the far eastern part of the city (Hubbelrath borough) at 165 metres (541 ft). The lowest point is at the far northern end in Wittlaer borough where the Schwarzbach enters the Rhine, with an average elevation of 28 metres (92 ft).\n\n\n=== Adjacent cities and districts ===\nThe following districts and cities border D\u00fcsseldorf (clockwise starting from the north): the City of Duisburg, the District of Mettmann (Ratingen, Mettmann, Erkrath, Hilden, Langenfeld, and Monheim), and the District of Neuss (Dormagen, Neuss, and Meerbusch).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe city has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb, mild in relation to East Germany).

The wind is calm (defined as being under 2 m/s or 4.5 mph) about 35% of the time, more frequently at night and in the winter.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nWith a population of 612,178 within the city boundaries (31 December 2015), D\u00fcsseldorf is Germany's seventh largest city. Its population surpassed the threshold of 100,000 inhabitants during the height of industrialisation in 1882, and peaked at just over 705,000 in 1962. The city then began to lose residents with many moving into neighbouring municipalities. However, since the late 1990s, the city's population has been slowly rising again.\nA total of 109,883 (18%) of D\u00fcsseldorf's population are foreigners (31 December 2008), the majority of whom come from within Europe (81,742).

Heinrich Heine, whose 200th birthday was celebrated in 1997 and who originally had a proposed memorial in the city dedicated to him; Clara and Robert Schumann; and as Felix Mendelssohn, are the most prominent artists related to the city, which is home to a distinguished Academy of Fine Arts.\nThe D\u00fcsseldorf cultural scene comprises traditional and avant-garde, classical and glamorous. The world-famous state art collection of North Rhine-Westphalia, the highly acclaimed Deutsche Oper am Rhein (opera), and the D\u00fcsseldorfer Schauspielhaus (theatre), artistic home of Gustaf Gr\u00fcndgens, are major elements of D\u00fcsseldorf's reputation as a centre of the fine arts.\n\n\n=== Beer ===\nD\u00fcsseldorf is well known for its Altbier, a hoppy beer which translates as old [style] beer, a reference to the pre-lager brewing method of using a warm top-fermenting yeast like British pale ales. Over time the Alt yeast adjusted to lower temperatures, and the Alt brewers would store or lager the beer after fermentation, leading to a cleaner, crisper beer. The name \"altbier\" first appeared in the 19th century to differentiate the beers of D\u00fcsseldorf from the new pale lager that was gaining a hold on Germany.Brewers in D\u00fcsseldorf used the pale malts that were used for the modern pale lagers, but retained the old (\"alt\") method of using warm fermenting yeasts. The first brewery to use the name Alt was Schumacher which opened in 1838. The founder, Mathias Schumacher, allowed the beer to mature in cool conditions in wooden casks for longer than normal, and laid the foundation for the modern alt \u2013 amber coloured and lagered. The result is a pale beer that has some of the lean dryness of a lager but with fruity notes as well.There are five pub-breweries in D\u00fcsseldorf which brew Altbier on the premises: F\u00fcchschen, Schumacher, Schl\u00fcssel, Uerige and Brauerei K\u00fcrzer. Four of the five are in the historic centre of D\u00fcsseldorf (Altstadt); the other (Schumacher), between the Altstadt and D\u00fcsseldorf Central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), also maintains an establishment in the Altstadt, Im Goldenen Kessel, across the street from Schl\u00fcssel.\nEach (except Brauerei K\u00fcrzer) produces a special, secret, seasonal \"Sticke\" version in small quantities, though the names vary: Schl\u00fcssel spells it \"Stike\", without the \"c\", while Schumacher calls its special beer \"Latzenbier\", meaning \"slat beer\", possibly because the kegs from which it was poured had been stored on raised shelves. F\u00fcchschen's seasonal is its Weihnachtsbier (Christmas beer), available in bottles starting mid-November, and served in the brewpub on Christmas Eve.\n\n\n=== Music and nightlife ===\n\nSince the 1950s the \"Kom(m)\u00f6dchen\" has been one of the most prominent political cabarets of Germany. The city's most famous contribution to the culture of modern popular music is beyond doubt the influential avant-garde electronic band Kraftwerk. Formed by a few D\u00fcsseldorf-born musicians, Kraftwerk is internationally known as the most significant band in the history of post-war German music and as pioneers in electronic music. Other influential musical groups originating from D\u00fcsseldorf include Neu!, formed in 1971 by Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother, after their split from Kraftwerk, and La D\u00fcsseldorf, also formed by Dinger in 1976 shortly after Neu! disbanded. Both groups had a significant influence on a variety of subsequent rock, post-punk, and electronic music artists.Internationally known power metal band Warlock was formed in D\u00fcsseldorf in 1982. Its frontwoman, Doro Pesch, had a successful solo career in Europe and Asia since Warlock ended. The punk band Die Toten Hosen, which is famous around the world, also the most popular singers in Germany Westernhagen and Heino come from D\u00fcsseldorf. The electronic act D.A.F. was formed in the city in 1978, as well as the electronic/industrial pioneers Die Krupps in 1980. Another famous formation is Fehlfarben. Founded in the late 1970s by Peter Hein, Frank Fenstermacher, Kurt Dahlke and Michael Kemner.\nD\u00fcsseldorf appears in several songs, including D\u00fcsseldorf by the British indie band Teleman and W\u00e4rst du doch in D\u00fcsseldorf geblieben by Danish singer Dorthe Kollo.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nD\u00fcsseldorf, Germany is the fashion capital of Germany as it is a major cultural center for the art and fashion scenes. The fashionable clothes trend took root in this city before 1949. 1949 is the date of the first fashion show staged in D\u00fcsseldorf. Fashion trends have occurred as access to more elegant clothing for the general public has been a part of the culture for almost a century. Two times a year an event called the, \u201cVoices of Fashion,\u201d occurs and attracts many people to visit D\u00fcsseldorf to find the latest fashion items.

Karneval ends on Aschermittwoch (Ash Wednesday).\n\n\n=== Cartwheeler of D\u00fcsseldorf ===\n\nThe D\u00fcsseldorfer Radschl\u00e4ger (Boy who does Cartwheels) is said to be the city's oldest tradition. The symbol of the cartwheeler can be found on many souvenirs and various things in D\u00fcsseldorf have the cartwheelers to thank for their names. This tradition was honoured in 1954 by the erection of a fountain, called Cartwheeler's Fountain, on the Burgplatz in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n==== Legends of its origin and history ====\nThe tradition cannot be linked to one specific historical event, instead, there are several stories surrounding the beginnings of the D\u00fcsseldorf Cartwheelers. Probably the most well known version is Battle of Worringen. In the battle of 1288 Count Adolf devastatingly defeated the Archbishop of Cologne. As a consequence of this victory, D\u00fcsseldorf obtained Town privileges. The inhabitants, especially the children ran joyfully on the streets and performed cartwheels.\nAnother story talks about a wedding procession during which one of the wheels of the wedding carriage broke. In order to fend off the threat of bad luck, a boy supposedly jumped to the carriage, took hold of the wheel and thus became a living part of the wheel. Whether the story is about the marriage of Jan Wellem and Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici or the wedding of Margravine Jakobea of Baden and Johann Wilhelm is debatable.\nAnother story gives an account of this wedding between Margrave Jacobe von Baden and Johann Wilhelm, in 1585. According to legend she felt miserable about her marriage, but the cartwheelers who displayed their skills next to her carriage were able to make her smile. Numerous travelers were attracted to the city by great exhibitions \u2013 the forerunner of today's fairs \u2013 between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. During this time the children who did the cart wheeling found out that it was a profitable source of income. The bourgeoisie accepted this in good humour as a symbolic act of local patriotism. In the beginning the lads shouted \"f\u00f6r eene Penning schlage ich das Rad\u201c (cartwheel for a penny). The Jan Wellem monument returned to D\u00fcsseldorf at the end of the Second World War. The procession was accompanied by torches, fanfares and the cartwheeling boys.\n\n\n===== Cartwheelers in the cityscape =====\nCartwheelers can be found by several fountains within the city and near many small landmarks. The most famous is Cartwheeler's Fountain in Burgplatz with an inscription of a quote by Hans M\u00fcller-Schl\u00f6sser: \"Radschl\u00e4ger wolle mer blieve, wie jeck et de Minschen och drieve\u201c (We will always remain cartwheelers, however crazy it drives people.) The fountain was designed by Alfred Zschorsch in 1954 and donated by the  Heimatverein D\u00fcsseldorfer Jonges, which is a club devoted to the maintenance of local and regional traditions. There are other cartwheelers that decorate storm drains and the door knocker on the Church of Lambertus, which was designed by Friedrich Becker. He created the cartwheeler in front of the Schadow Arcades.This tradition has been kept alive by the Alde D\u00fcsseldorfer B\u00fcrgergesellschaft von 1920 e. V., a society founded in 1920, who organized the first cartwheeler competition on 17 October 1937. Since 1971 this event has been held annually in cooperation with the Stadtsparkasse (a local bank), but formerly took place in the K\u00f6nigsallee. Since 2006 it has taken place on the Rheinwerft, near the old part of town. This is a fixed date in the city\u2019s calendar of events. About 500 boys regularly participate in this event and since 1971 girls have also taken part. In 2001 the art project Radschl\u00e4ger-Kunst (Cartwheeler Art) was called into life, in which over 100 cartwheeler sculptures have been designed by various artists. The door knocker on the Church of Lambertus functioned as a model for the sculptures that are 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) high, 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) wide and 30 cm (12 in) deep. They were positioned around the city centre. Some of the sculptures have been auctioned off to companies and private owners.\n\n\n=== Christmas market ===\nEvery Christmas, the city of D\u00fcsseldorf uses the city centre to host one of the largest Christmas gatherings in Germany. The Christmas festival occurs every year from 17 November until 23 December. This Christmas fest brings D\u00fcsseldorf a large portion of tourism every year as many people from nearby areas come to the city to drink mulled wine and hot chocolate and watch craftsman blow glass and create art. The event contains many small wooden buildings all clustered in the middle of the city for all the citizens to enjoy. The event, to many visitors, has an old European feel, but is very lively.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nTraditional meals in the region are Rheinischer Sauerbraten (a beef roast and sometimes horse marinated for a few days in vinegar and spices served with gravy and raisins) and Heaven and Earth (Himmel und \u00c4d; black pudding with stewed apples mixed with mashed potatoes). In winter the people like to eat Muscheln Rheinischer Art (Rhenish-style mussels) as well as Reibekuchen (fried potato pancake served with apple sauce). Also a special meal: D\u00fcsseldorfer Senfrostbraten (Steaks roasted with D\u00fcsseldorf mustard on top).\nD\u00fcsseldorf is known for its strong Dijon-like mustard served in a traditional pot called \"Mostertp\u00f6ttche\", which was eternalised in a still life by Vincent van Gogh in 1884.The Rhine Metropolis is one of the most diverse areas in terms of culinary diversity. D\u00fcsseldorf, with the third largest Japanese community in Europe, not only provides a wide range of culinary cuisine but also has a solid foundation of Authentic Asian food in the city. D\u00fcsseldorf's exceptional culinary cuisine has been recognized and visited by the Worldwide leading travel guide of Lonely Planet. Along with a broad range of diverse cultural cuisine, D\u00fcsseldorf is also home to various Michelin starred restaurants that are world renowned.Halve Hahn \u2013 this dish is made from a half a double rye roll, which is another of the specialties of D\u00fcsseldorf, buttered, with a thick slice of aged Gouda cheese, onions, mustard, ground paprika and sour pickles.\nHimmel un Aad \u2013 a dish of mashed potatoes and apples along with slices of blutwurst. Caramelized onions are usually served with this meal.\nReibekuchen is another famous dish from D\u00fcsseldorf; this dish is usually drizzled with R\u00fcbensyrup (beet syrup) and is served on pumpernickel slices along with applesauce\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nThe F\u00f6rderpreis f\u00fcr Literatur der Landeshauptstadt D\u00fcsseldorf is a German Literary award donated by the City of D\u00fcsseldorf in Northrhine-Westphalia. The Prize for Literature in support of the City of D\u00fcsseldorf is awarded since 1972 by the Council of the City due to the decisions of the courts.The F\u00f6rderpreis f\u00fcr Literatur der Landeshauptstadt D\u00fcsseldorf is given once a year to artists and groups, especially to the areas of poetry, writing, review and translation.\n\n\n=== Rivalry with Cologne ===\nD\u00fcsseldorf and Cologne have a \"fierce regional rivalry\". The rivalry includes carnival parades, football, ice hockey and beer. People in Cologne prefer K\u00f6lsch while people in D\u00fcsseldorf prefer Alt. Waiters and patrons will \"scorn\" and make a \"mockery\" of people who order Alt beer in Cologne and K\u00f6lsch in D\u00fcsseldorf. The rivalry has been described as a \"love-hate relationship\".\n\n\n=== Theatres ===\n\nApollo (variet\u00e9, circus; shows do not require knowledge of German language)\nCapitol (musicals)\nDeutsche Oper am Rhein (Opera; Ballet)\nD\u00fcsseldorfer Schauspielhaus; the theatre started with theatrical performances in 1585\nD\u00fcsseldorfer Marionetten-Theater\nMerkur Spiel-Arena (Venue of the Eurovision Song Contest 2011)\nFFT \u2013 Forum Freies Theater (intimate theatre)\nJunges Theater in der Altstadt\nKlangraum (20th-century classical music)\nKom(m)\u00f6dchen (Political cabaret)\nKom\u00f6die D\u00fcsseldorf\nPalais Wittgenstein\nPuppentheater an der Helmholtzstra\u00dfe (puppetry)\nRobert-Schumann-Saal\nSavoy-Theater\nSeniorentheater in der Altstadt\nTanzhaus NRW (theatre for dance)\nTonhalle D\u00fcsseldorf (concert hall for classical music, jazz, pop, cabaret)\nTheater an der K\u00f6\nTheater an der Luegallee\nTheateratelier Takelgarn\nTheater Flin\nTheater Glorreich\n\n\n=== Museums, arts and history institutes, and other attractions ===\n\nAkademie-Galerie (exhibition space of the Art Academy D\u00fcsseldorf)\nAndreaskirche\nAquazoo-L\u00f6bbecke-Museum (aquarium and zoological museum)\nTvTower\nBRAUSE \u2013 Vereinsheim des Metzgerei Schnitzel Kunstvereins e.V.\nFilm museum\nFilmstiftung NRW (NRW Film Foundation)\nForum NRW\nGoethe-Museum\nHeinrich-Heine-Institut\nHeinrich Heine Birth-house\nHetjens Museum (German museum of ceramics)\nImai \u2013 inter media art institute\nInstitut Fran\u00e7ais D\u00fcsseldorf\nInstitut f\u00fcr Kunstdokumentation und Szenografie (Institute for Art Documentation and Scenography)\nJulia Stoschek Collection (video art)\nKAI 10|Raum f\u00fcr Kunst\nKulturbahnhof Eller\nKunstarchiv Kaiserswerth (works of Bernd and Hilla Becher/Kahmen Collection)\nKunst im Tunnel (KIT)\nKunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen (Art Collection Northrhine-Westphalia) \u2013 K20 (Grabbeplatz) and K21 (St\u00e4ndehaus)\nKunsthalle D\u00fcsseldorf\nKunstverein f\u00fcr die Rheinlande und Westfalen (Society for the Promotion of the Fine Arts)\nMuseum Kunst Palast\nMahn- und Gedenkst\u00e4tte f\u00fcr die Opfer des Nationalsozialmus (Memorial museum for victims of Nationalsocialism)\nOnomato\nPolnisches Institut D\u00fcsseldorf\nPuppentheater an der Helmholtzstra\u00dfe\nRathaus\nReinraum e.V. \u2013 Verein zur F\u00f6rderung von Kunst und Kultur\nRheinturm (Rhine Tower; highest building and landmark of D\u00fcsseldorf)\nSt. Lambertuskirche\nSchiffahrt Museum\nSchloss J\u00e4gerhof\nSchlossturm\nSchloss und Park Benrath (Palace and park of Benrath)\nStadtbibliothek\nStadtmuseum (City history museum)\nStatue of Jan Wellem\nTheatermuseum, D\u00fcsseldorf\nTriton Museum\nVolkshochschule\nZakk \u2013 cultural centre with concerts, readings, debates and party\n\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\nBotanischer Garten D\u00fcsseldorf, a modern botanical garden\nHofgarten\nThe Nordpark, with the Aquazoo\nThe S\u00fcdfriedhof (The South Cemetery)\nVolksgarten adjacent to S\u00fcdpark\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nD\u00fcsseldorf's main football team Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf won the 1933 German championship, the German Cup in 1979 and 1980, and were finalists in the European Cup Winners Cup in 1979.

          "WHAT a disappointment! \u20ac9 entry just to see a few fish swimming around in an assortment of tanks along with boxes on the walls of a few snakes, various spiders and others reptiles. The Penquins looked totally pissed off with their dirty surroundings but gave a glimmer of delight",
          "If this is you thing and even if its just a maybe, I would highly recommend a visit here. The U-Bahn Nordpark/Aquazoo stops almost right outside the entrance, then its about a 300m walk to the building itself. Normally \u20ac9 to gain admission, the 3 of us got in free on the",
          "We went to the aquarium with an open mind and were totally blown away by the various exhibits and amount of animals and fish here. There was everything from Puffins to Mongoose and alligators too. There were also lots of areas for children to interact with which was good too.",
          "The aquazoo is a very good place to visit if you are interested in fish, aquatic animals, and flora and fauna around the area. It also has lots of geological specimens, as well as fossils and the like. It also has a lot of interactive displays. The displays are suitable for",
          "Do you like sea life? this place is filled with many types of fishes from sharks to very tiny and small fishes, penguins, crocodiles, and many others. also you could see some land animals like different types of snakes, lizards, insects,... this place is very good for children",
          "We visited the Aquazoo with our children and found it a bit confusing. To start with, at the Reception area the member of staff informed us \u201conly cash and German cards accepted\u201d, no Visa, MasterCard or Amex. Then all the signs to each exhibition were in German only, absolutely",
          "This is a fantastic place to visit both for adults and children. There are lots of aquariums, large and small full of a variety of marine life. You can also see aligators and puffins. The sharks and stingrays were particularly impressive. A great venue to visit at any time.",
          "Easy to reach with subway. Sunday was crowded, so I'd recommend going on some other day. There was a lot of aquariums, beautiful and interesting animals and also information (in German mostly). Not the biggest or best aquarium I've been to, but no disappointment. Free access",
          "Visited this place after seeing it as one of the top recommended places to visit in Dusseldorf on tripadvisor. Glad I did! It has nice aquariums and good information on each of the animals. It also has some explanation in English, although mostly are in German. We easily spent",
          "We had purchased a bus/tram three day ticket, which also allowed us to visit this zoo free of charge. Huge array of sea creatures in an extremely well kept museum. Stingrays and shark were my favourites, whilst my daughter enjoyed watching the alligators the most. Easy to get",
          "great fun for kids and adults. it occupied us for a good 1.5 hours. The animals and creatures all seemed to be very well cared for and healthy. easy parking and easily accessible. although all info was in german, so we were guessing and just observing for most of it. still fun",
          "It came as a pleasant surprise to be greeted by puffins. We had been greeted by the staff at the reception first but the puffins were the first thing we saw. Lots of fish etc all displayed in a variety of tanks including several panoramic ones. Some were larger - like the",

          "This is not your average zoo, but one specialized in maritime life. Mostly fish, but also amphibians and some small mammals or penguins. And a small separate section with minerals and crystals. It is very interactive, many things to touch, little games and quizzes to play. Also",

          "Great zoo/museum with a focus on fish, reptiles, amphibians and insects. For 9 Euro entry fee it's a good value for money. Very educational, you learn all about how life developed on Earth, how wasps build their nests and all that interesting stuff about nature. Good for",
          "Visited this attraction recently ; fortunately my German friend had booked tickets on line so no hanging about in the queue . This certainly is a great place for children to learn about the evolution of life on earth but our group of over-fifties found it equally fascinating",
          "What a great place, we'd heard the Aquazoo had been recently reopened & we were keen to take our daughter along, she's pretty interested in animals & fascinated with watching them play, swim and eat! Essentially it's a really informative museum aimed at children with a few",
          "For those who have not been to big Aquamarine Parks or Ocean Park and Zoo this one is good enough for them. Not too crowded on regular days but for sure it is crowded on weekends. Theres not much to shop in their \"shop\" only little tokens. But their grounds and parking are wide",
          "Took the hop on hop off bus to this location. When we arrived there only the people with online tickets were granted access, for normal access they said we need to wait 3 hours even thought that there were no queues. Tried to book online on the phone but also online, the next",
          "After four years of renovation, the Aquazoo was reopened to visitors in September 2017. The Aquazoo was originally planned to open its doors again in 2015. But the conversion was delayed again and again. The total costs were 20.9 million euros in the end, around eight million",
          "Spent my daughters 4th birthday here (opening day). Much better than expected - good mixture of museum and aquarium and not too large that the kids get bored and tired. Could have a few more interactive activities e.g. find and scratch type cards or collect stamps from each",

          "We visited the aquarium, it was an unforgettable experience!!! We saw terrific, rare fish like pirancha, sharks!!! We walked in an artificial rain-forest, right above a crocodile pond!! I mean, it was really a worthwile visits!! It was a kind of excursion tha makes you richer",
          "We used the hop on hop off bus. We were not told the aqua zoo was closed for a refurb... but the park was beautiful to walk round and had a fab little restaurant in the centre of the park...whose staff were so lovely.",
          "Very big aquarium. You need two, three hours to get though. It also has some insects and snakes and monkeys and even some penguins. The park in front is also beautiful. Perfect for eating some snack and resting by the water after long walk in the aquarium. I will for sure go",
          "Taking full advantage of our bargain all-day travelcard (EUR 9.5 for two adults) we took the tram away from the city centre to the Nordpark stop to see the Aquazoo. Unfortunately when we got there it became very clear that the whole place was in the middle of a major",
          "Filled with wide variety of fishes and some reptiles and sharks too this was a different experience and one you got to see if you love seeing fishes swimming around in beautiful aquariums. The snake collection was good to although not many snakes were there. Small and lovely",
          "I went there today (31/5/2014) and it was closed for renovation. Acording to the signs, it will only open again in the spring of 2015. However, the park arround it was worth the visit, so I did not feel like it was a waste of time.",
          "I highly recommend this place if you like fish and snakes. I know this place for many years and I can not understand some of the bad ratings. I never have seen this place dirty at all. Just go there and judge by yourself. Great value for money.",
          "Very interesting place for kids and adults as well. The plenty of different animals and fish all around. I've been there in October and I was told that they were going to reconstruct the building and a half of the exhibits are in neighborhood aquariums. But nevertheless their",
          "Highly recommended if you like fish! This is an amazing place with so many aquariums and every fish you can think of. You just wander from one room into another and another. All the written information is in German, but as the fish are all there in front of you it wasn't a big",
          "Loved it, lots to look at. Entry was cheap. 14 euros on a family ticket. Had a coffee shop. A perfect day out.",
          "Beautiful is how I describe this. It was simply stunning.i recommend this to all especially families with little kids. Dusseldorf doesn't have many attractions for kids so this must be one of the very few.visit this if you can as it is stunning. The staff were great and it",

          "A cheap visit for those on a budget who want to be educated. Yes, its an aquarium, but it has other small animals of interest. There is an audio tour in English which adds to the visit. We didnt visit the restaurant or the nearby Nordpark. One note, dont take the hop on/hop off",
          "Good fun for the kids. Other than that not that great. Have seen better aquariums else where. There wasn't anything that stood out. Just the usual. The penguins area was alright, but the rest nothing noteworthy. Not worth the 7 Euro price tag. Easily accessible via the subway",
          "During our visit in D\u00fcsseldorf we bought a welcome card at the tourist information center. We had free access for aquazoo. Fee is about 7 euros so we thought that it would be a small zoo. But it wasn't, we walked around for about 2-3 hours. It was very interesting. Saw fishes",

          "We spent a chunk of a rainy afternoon in Dusseldorf visiting this aquarium/museum. The kids loved going around and seeing the different aquatic life that the place has. The place was packed on a Sunday. I suspect it has a lot to do with the weather outside. This is no Shedd",

          "The whole experience was just bland, nothing more than fish in tanks. There was one section in the middle with non-aquatic animals, but generally it was quite dull. No apparent attempts to develop a theme, or atmosphere outside of the tanks. The best acquariums make you feel",
          "The Aquarium was very disappointing. While I understand that fish don't need AS much space as larger animals, many exhibits seemed like the animals had little/no space for any type of activity. Wasn't very exciting at all, and most of the information was either outdated or",

          "Very good for a family day out. Many species exhibits in Acquarium and a small tropical forest. Well organised (e.g. steps in evolution tanks, section with insects, live feeding etc). The only issue that I can spot for improvement is the small souvenir shop which is",
          "Aaaaa, this is so exciting!!! Amazingly beautiful fish, I never thought something like this existed. Aquazoo is definately the best attraction in Dusseldorf. Make sure you have at least three hous to explore Aquazoo, because there's so much to see, and it's a shame to miss"

At the confluence of the Rhine and its tributary D\u00fcssel, the city lies in the centre of both the Rhine-Ruhr and the Rhineland Metropolitan Regions with the Cologne Bonn Region to its south and the Ruhr to its north. Most of the city lies on the right bank of the Rhine (as opposed to Cologne, whose city centre lies on the river's left bank). The city is the largest in the German Low Franconian dialect area (closely related to Dutch). \"Dorf\" meaning \"village\" in German, the \"-dorf\" suffix (English cognate: thorp) is unusual in the German-speaking area for a settlement of D\u00fcsseldorf's size.\nMercer's 2012 Quality of Living survey ranked D\u00fcsseldorf the sixth most livable city in the world. D\u00fcsseldorf Airport is Germany's third-busiest airport after those of Frankfurt and Munich, serving as the most important international airport for the inhabitants of the densely populated Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area. D\u00fcsseldorf is an international business and financial centre, renowned for its fashion and trade fairs, and is headquarters to one Fortune Global 500 and two DAX companies. Messe D\u00fcsseldorf organises nearly one fifth of premier trade shows. As second largest city of the Rhineland, D\u00fcsseldorf holds Rhenish Carnival celebrations every year in February/March, the D\u00fcsseldorf carnival celebrations being the third most popular in Germany after those held in Cologne and Mainz.There are 22 institutions of higher education in the city including the Heinrich-Heine-Universit\u00e4t D\u00fcsseldorf, the university of applied sciences (Hochschule D\u00fcsseldorf), the academy of arts (Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf) (Joseph Beuys, Emanuel Leutze, August Macke, Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, and Andreas Gursky), and the university of music (Robert-Schumann-Musikhochschule D\u00fcsseldorf). The city is also known for its pioneering influence on electronic/experimental music (Kraftwerk) and its Japanese community.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early development ===\nWhen the Roman Empire was strengthening its position throughout Europe, a few Germanic tribes clung on in marshy territory off the eastern banks of the Rhine. In the 7th and 8th centuries, the odd farming or fishing settlement could be found at the point where the small river D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine. It was from such settlements that the city of D\u00fcsseldorf grew.\n\nThe first written mention of D\u00fcsseldorf (then called Dusseldorp in the local Low Rhenish dialect) dates back to 1135. Under Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa the small town of Kaiserswerth to the north of D\u00fcsseldorf became a well-fortified outpost, where soldiers kept a watchful eye on every movement on the Rhine. Kaiserswerth eventually became a suburb of D\u00fcsseldorf in 1929. In 1186, D\u00fcsseldorf came under the rule of the Counts of Berg. 14 August 1288 is one of the most important dates in the history of D\u00fcsseldorf. On this day the sovereign Count Adolf VIII of Berg granted the village on the banks of the D\u00fcssel town privileges. Before this, a bloody struggle for power had taken place between the Archbishop of Cologne and the count of Berg, culminating in the Battle of Worringen.\n\nThe Archbishop of Cologne's forces were wiped out by the forces of the count of Berg who were supported by citizens and farmers of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf, paving the way for D\u00fcsseldorf's elevation to city status, which is commemorated today by a monument on the Burgplatz. The custom of turning cartwheels is credited to the children of D\u00fcsseldorf. There are variations of the origin of the cartwheeling children. Today the symbol (Der Radschl\u00e4ger) represents the story and every year the D\u00fcsseldorfers celebrate by having a cartwheeling contest. After this battle the relationship between the four cities deteriorated, because they were commercial rivals; it is often said that there is a kind of hostility between the citizens of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf. Today, it finds its expression mainly in a humorous form (especially during the Rhineland Karneval) and in sports.A market square sprang up on the banks of the Rhine and the square was protected by city walls on all four sides. In 1380, the dukes of Berg moved their seat to the town and D\u00fcsseldorf was made regional capital of the Duchy of Berg. During the following centuries several famous landmarks were built, including the Collegiate Church of St Lambertus. In 1609, the ducal line of the United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg died out, and after a virulent struggle over succession, J\u00fclich and Berg fell to the Wittelsbach Counts of Palatinate-Neuburg, who made D\u00fcsseldorf their main domicile, even after they inherited the Electorate of the Palatinate, in 1685, becoming now Prince-electors as Electors Palatine.Under the art-loving Johann Wilhelm II (r. 1690\u20131716), a vast art gallery with a huge selection of paintings and sculptures, were housed in the Stadtschloss (city castle). After his death, the city fell on hard times again, especially after Elector Charles Theodore inherited Bavaria and moved the electoral court to Munich. With him he took the art collection, which became part of what is now the Alte Pinakothek in Munich. Destruction and poverty struck D\u00fcsseldorf after the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon made Berg a Grand Duchy and D\u00fcsseldorf its capital. Johann Devaranne, a leader of Solingen's resistance to Napoleon's conscription decrees, was executed here in 1813. After Napoleon's defeat, the whole Rhineland including Berg was given to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815. The Rhine Province's parliament was established in D\u00fcsseldorf.

Over time the Alt yeast adjusted to lower temperatures, and the Alt brewers would store or lager the beer after fermentation, leading to a cleaner, crisper beer. The name \"altbier\" first appeared in the 19th century to differentiate the beers of D\u00fcsseldorf from the new pale lager that was gaining a hold on Germany.Brewers in D\u00fcsseldorf used the pale malts that were used for the modern pale lagers, but retained the old (\"alt\") method of using warm fermenting yeasts. The first brewery to use the name Alt was Schumacher which opened in 1838. The founder, Mathias Schumacher, allowed the beer to mature in cool conditions in wooden casks for longer than normal, and laid the foundation for the modern alt \u2013 amber coloured and lagered. The result is a pale beer that has some of the lean dryness of a lager but with fruity notes as well.There are five pub-breweries in D\u00fcsseldorf which brew Altbier on the premises: F\u00fcchschen, Schumacher, Schl\u00fcssel, Uerige and Brauerei K\u00fcrzer. Four of the five are in the historic centre of D\u00fcsseldorf (Altstadt); the other (Schumacher), between the Altstadt and D\u00fcsseldorf Central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), also maintains an establishment in the Altstadt, Im Goldenen Kessel, across the street from Schl\u00fcssel.\nEach (except Brauerei K\u00fcrzer) produces a special, secret, seasonal \"Sticke\" version in small quantities, though the names vary: Schl\u00fcssel spells it \"Stike\", without the \"c\", while Schumacher calls its special beer \"Latzenbier\", meaning \"slat beer\", possibly because the kegs from which it was poured had been stored on raised shelves. F\u00fcchschen's seasonal is its Weihnachtsbier (Christmas beer), available in bottles starting mid-November, and served in the brewpub on Christmas Eve.\n\n\n=== Music and nightlife ===\n\nSince the 1950s the \"Kom(m)\u00f6dchen\" has been one of the most prominent political cabarets of Germany. The city's most famous contribution to the culture of modern popular music is beyond doubt the influential avant-garde electronic band Kraftwerk. Formed by a few D\u00fcsseldorf-born musicians, Kraftwerk is internationally known as the most significant band in the history of post-war German music and as pioneers in electronic music. Other influential musical groups originating from D\u00fcsseldorf include Neu!, formed in 1971 by Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother, after their split from Kraftwerk, and La D\u00fcsseldorf, also formed by Dinger in 1976 shortly after Neu! disbanded. Both groups had a significant influence on a variety of subsequent rock, post-punk, and electronic music artists.Internationally known power metal band Warlock was formed in D\u00fcsseldorf in 1982. Its frontwoman, Doro Pesch, had a successful solo career in Europe and Asia since Warlock ended.

The fashionable clothes trend took root in this city before 1949. 1949 is the date of the first fashion show staged in D\u00fcsseldorf. Fashion trends have occurred as access to more elegant clothing for the general public has been a part of the culture for almost a century.

Karneval ends on Aschermittwoch (Ash Wednesday).\n\n\n=== Cartwheeler of D\u00fcsseldorf ===\n\nThe D\u00fcsseldorfer Radschl\u00e4ger (Boy who does Cartwheels) is said to be the city's oldest tradition. The symbol of the cartwheeler can be found on many souvenirs and various things in D\u00fcsseldorf have the cartwheelers to thank for their names. This tradition was honoured in 1954 by the erection of a fountain, called Cartwheeler's Fountain, on the Burgplatz in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n==== Legends of its origin and history ====\nThe tradition cannot be linked to one specific historical event, instead, there are several stories surrounding the beginnings of the D\u00fcsseldorf Cartwheelers. Probably the most well known version is Battle of Worringen. In the battle of 1288 Count Adolf devastatingly defeated the Archbishop of Cologne. As a consequence of this victory, D\u00fcsseldorf obtained Town privileges. The inhabitants, especially the children ran joyfully on the streets and performed cartwheels.\nAnother story talks about a wedding procession during which one of the wheels of the wedding carriage broke. In order to fend off the threat of bad luck, a boy supposedly jumped to the carriage, took hold of the wheel and thus became a living part of the wheel. Whether the story is about the marriage of Jan Wellem and Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici or the wedding of Margravine Jakobea of Baden and Johann Wilhelm is debatable.\nAnother story gives an account of this wedding between Margrave Jacobe von Baden and Johann Wilhelm, in 1585. According to legend she felt miserable about her marriage, but the cartwheelers who displayed their skills next to her carriage were able to make her smile. Numerous travelers were attracted to the city by great exhibitions \u2013 the forerunner of today's fairs \u2013 between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. During this time the children who did the cart wheeling found out that it was a profitable source of income. The bourgeoisie accepted this in good humour as a symbolic act of local patriotism. In the beginning the lads shouted \"f\u00f6r eene Penning schlage ich das Rad\u201c (cartwheel for a penny). The Jan Wellem monument returned to D\u00fcsseldorf at the end of the Second World War. The procession was accompanied by torches, fanfares and the cartwheeling boys.\n\n\n===== Cartwheelers in the cityscape =====\nCartwheelers can be found by several fountains within the city and near many small landmarks. The most famous is Cartwheeler's Fountain in Burgplatz with an inscription of a quote by Hans M\u00fcller-Schl\u00f6sser: \"Radschl\u00e4ger wolle mer blieve, wie jeck et de Minschen och drieve\u201c (We will always remain cartwheelers, however crazy it drives people.) The fountain was designed by Alfred Zschorsch in 1954 and donated by the  Heimatverein D\u00fcsseldorfer Jonges, which is a club devoted to the maintenance of local and regional traditions. There are other cartwheelers that decorate storm drains and the door knocker on the Church of Lambertus, which was designed by Friedrich Becker. He created the cartwheeler in front of the Schadow Arcades.This tradition has been kept alive by the Alde D\u00fcsseldorfer B\u00fcrgergesellschaft von 1920 e. V., a society founded in 1920, who organized the first cartwheeler competition on 17 October 1937. Since 1971 this event has been held annually in cooperation with the Stadtsparkasse (a local bank), but formerly took place in the K\u00f6nigsallee. Since 2006 it has taken place on the Rheinwerft, near the old part of town. This is a fixed date in the city\u2019s calendar of events. About 500 boys regularly participate in this event and since 1971 girls have also taken part. In 2001 the art project Radschl\u00e4ger-Kunst (Cartwheeler Art) was called into life, in which over 100 cartwheeler sculptures have been designed by various artists. The door knocker on the Church of Lambertus functioned as a model for the sculptures that are 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) high, 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) wide and 30 cm (12 in) deep. They were positioned around the city centre. Some of the sculptures have been auctioned off to companies and private owners.\n\n\n=== Christmas market ===\nEvery Christmas, the city of D\u00fcsseldorf uses the city centre to host one of the largest Christmas gatherings in Germany. The Christmas festival occurs every year from 17 November until 23 December. This Christmas fest brings D\u00fcsseldorf a large portion of tourism every year as many people from nearby areas come to the city to drink mulled wine and hot chocolate and watch craftsman blow glass and create art. The event contains many small wooden buildings all clustered in the middle of the city for all the citizens to enjoy.

        "wiki": "D\u00fcsseldorf (often Dusseldorf in English sources; UK: , US: , German: [\u02c8d\u028fsl\u0329d\u0254\u0281f] (listen);  Low Franconian and Ripuarian: D\u00fcsseld\u00f6rp ([\u02c8d\u028fsl\u0329d\u0153\u0250\u032fp]); archaic Dutch: Dusseldorp) is the capital and second-largest city of the most populous German state of North Rhine-Westphalia after Cologne, and the seventh-largest city in Germany, with a population of 617,280. At the confluence of the Rhine and its tributary D\u00fcssel, the city lies in the centre of both the Rhine-Ruhr and the Rhineland Metropolitan Regions with the Cologne Bonn Region to its south and the Ruhr to its north. Most of the city lies on the right bank of the Rhine (as opposed to Cologne, whose city centre lies on the river's left bank). The city is the largest in the German Low Franconian dialect area (closely related to Dutch). \"Dorf\" meaning \"village\" in German, the \"-dorf\" suffix (English cognate: thorp) is unusual in the German-speaking area for a settlement of D\u00fcsseldorf's size.\nMercer's 2012 Quality of Living survey ranked D\u00fcsseldorf the sixth most livable city in the world. D\u00fcsseldorf Airport is Germany's third-busiest airport after those of Frankfurt and Munich, serving as the most important international airport for the inhabitants of the densely populated Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area. D\u00fcsseldorf is an international business and financial centre, renowned for its fashion and trade fairs, and is headquarters to one Fortune Global 500 and two DAX companies. Messe D\u00fcsseldorf organises nearly one fifth of premier trade shows. As second largest city of the Rhineland, D\u00fcsseldorf holds Rhenish Carnival celebrations every year in February/March, the D\u00fcsseldorf carnival celebrations being the third most popular in Germany after those held in Cologne and Mainz.There are 22 institutions of higher education in the city including the Heinrich-Heine-Universit\u00e4t D\u00fcsseldorf, the university of applied sciences (Hochschule D\u00fcsseldorf), the academy of arts (Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf) (Joseph Beuys, Emanuel Leutze, August Macke, Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, and Andreas Gursky), and the university of music (Robert-Schumann-Musikhochschule D\u00fcsseldorf). The city is also known for its pioneering influence on electronic/experimental music (Kraftwerk) and its Japanese community.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early development ===\nWhen the Roman Empire was strengthening its position throughout Europe, a few Germanic tribes clung on in marshy territory off the eastern banks of the Rhine. In the 7th and 8th centuries, the odd farming or fishing settlement could be found at the point where the small river D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine. It was from such settlements that the city of D\u00fcsseldorf grew.\n\nThe first written mention of D\u00fcsseldorf (then called Dusseldorp in the local Low Rhenish dialect) dates back to 1135. Under Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa the small town of Kaiserswerth to the north of D\u00fcsseldorf became a well-fortified outpost, where soldiers kept a watchful eye on every movement on the Rhine. Kaiserswerth eventually became a suburb of D\u00fcsseldorf in 1929. In 1186, D\u00fcsseldorf came under the rule of the Counts of Berg. 14 August 1288 is one of the most important dates in the history of D\u00fcsseldorf. On this day the sovereign Count Adolf VIII of Berg granted the village on the banks of the D\u00fcssel town privileges. Before this, a bloody struggle for power had taken place between the Archbishop of Cologne and the count of Berg, culminating in the Battle of Worringen.\n\nThe Archbishop of Cologne's forces were wiped out by the forces of the count of Berg who were supported by citizens and farmers of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf, paving the way for D\u00fcsseldorf's elevation to city status, which is commemorated today by a monument on the Burgplatz. The custom of turning cartwheels is credited to the children of D\u00fcsseldorf. There are variations of the origin of the cartwheeling children. Today the symbol (Der Radschl\u00e4ger) represents the story and every year the D\u00fcsseldorfers celebrate by having a cartwheeling contest. After this battle the relationship between the four cities deteriorated, because they were commercial rivals; it is often said that there is a kind of hostility between the citizens of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf. Today, it finds its expression mainly in a humorous form (especially during the Rhineland Karneval) and in sports.A market square sprang up on the banks of the Rhine and the square was protected by city walls on all four sides. In 1380, the dukes of Berg moved their seat to the town and D\u00fcsseldorf was made regional capital of the Duchy of Berg. During the following centuries several famous landmarks were built, including the Collegiate Church of St Lambertus. In 1609, the ducal line of the United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg died out, and after a virulent struggle over succession, J\u00fclich and Berg fell to the Wittelsbach Counts of Palatinate-Neuburg, who made D\u00fcsseldorf their main domicile, even after they inherited the Electorate of the Palatinate, in 1685, becoming now Prince-electors as Electors Palatine.Under the art-loving Johann Wilhelm II (r. 1690\u20131716), a vast art gallery with a huge selection of paintings and sculptures, were housed in the Stadtschloss (city castle). After his death, the city fell on hard times again, especially after Elector Charles Theodore inherited Bavaria and moved the electoral court to Munich. With him he took the art collection, which became part of what is now the Alte Pinakothek in Munich. Destruction and poverty struck D\u00fcsseldorf after the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon made Berg a Grand Duchy and D\u00fcsseldorf its capital. Johann Devaranne, a leader of Solingen's resistance to Napoleon's conscription decrees, was executed here in 1813. After Napoleon's defeat, the whole Rhineland including Berg was given to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815. The Rhine Province's parliament was established in D\u00fcsseldorf. By the mid-19th century, D\u00fcsseldorf enjoyed a revival thanks to the Industrial Revolution as the city boasted 100,000 inhabitants by 1882; the figure doubled in 1892.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nDuring World War I the Royal Naval Air Service (RNS) undertook the first Entente strategic bombing missions on 22 September 1914, when it bombed the Zeppelin bases in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\nIn 1920, D\u00fcsseldorf became the centre of the General Strike. On 15 April 1920, 45 delegates of the German Miners Union were murdered by the Freikorps.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nThe city was a target of strategic bombing during World War II, particularly during the RAF bombing campaign in 1943 when over 700 bombers were used in a single night. Raids continued late into the war. As part of the campaign against German oil facilities, the RAF raid of 20\u201321 February on the Rhenania Ossag refinery in the Reisholz district of the city halted oil production there. The Allied ground advance into Germany reached D\u00fcsseldorf in mid-April 1945. The United States 97th Infantry Division easily captured the city on 18 April 1945, after the local German Resistance group launched Aktion Rheinland.\n\n\n=== German Federal Republic ===\nIn 1946, D\u00fcsseldorf was made capital of the new federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The city's reconstruction proceeded at a frantic pace and the economic transformation guided D\u00fcsseldorf's economic growth.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Physical geography ===\n\nD\u00fcsseldorf lies at the centre of the Lower Rhine basin, where the delta of the D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine. The city lies on the east side of the Rhine, except District 4 (Oberkassel, Niederkassel, Heerdt and L\u00f6rick).\nAcross the Rhine, the city of Neuss stands on the delta of the Erft. D\u00fcsseldorf lies southwest of the Ruhr urban area, and in the middle of the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region.\nD\u00fcsseldorf is built entirely on alluvium, mud, sand, clay and occasionally gravel. The highest point in D\u00fcsseldorf is the top of Sandberg in the far eastern part of the city (Hubbelrath borough) at 165 metres (541 ft). The lowest point is at the far northern end in Wittlaer borough where the Schwarzbach enters the Rhine, with an average elevation of 28 metres (92 ft).\n\n\n=== Adjacent cities and districts ===\nThe following districts and cities border D\u00fcsseldorf (clockwise starting from the north): the City of Duisburg, the District of Mettmann (Ratingen, Mettmann, Erkrath, Hilden, Langenfeld, and Monheim), and the District of Neuss (Dormagen, Neuss, and Meerbusch).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe city has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb, mild in relation to East Germany). Like the rest of the lower Rhineland, D\u00fcsseldorf experiences moderate winters with little snowfall and mild to warm summers. The average annual temperature is 10.6 \u00b0C (51 \u00b0F) with an average yearly precipitation of 797 millimetres (31 in). The dominant wind direction is from the west with velocities in the range of 3 to 4 m/s (7\u20139 mph), with gusts of 3.5 \u22124.8 m/s (8\u201310.7 mph). The wind is calm (defined as being under 2 m/s or 4.5 mph) about 35% of the time, more frequently at night and in the winter.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nWith a population of 612,178 within the city boundaries (31 December 2015), D\u00fcsseldorf is Germany's seventh largest city. Its population surpassed the threshold of 100,000 inhabitants during the height of industrialisation in 1882, and peaked at just over 705,000 in 1962. The city then began to lose residents with many moving into neighbouring municipalities. However, since the late 1990s, the city's population has been slowly rising again.\nA total of 109,883 (18%) of D\u00fcsseldorf's population are foreigners (31 December 2008), the majority of whom come from within Europe (81,742). The largest national minorities are Turks, Greeks, and Poles. D\u00fcsseldorf and its surroundings have the third-largest Japanese community in Europe and the largest in Germany (about 11,000 people). D\u00fcsseldorf has the third-largest Jewish community in Germany, with about 7,000 members.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Mayors ===\n\n\n=== Districts ===\n\nSince 1975, D\u00fcsseldorf is divided into ten administrative districts. Each district (Bezirk) has its own elected district council (Bezirksvertretung) and its own district mayor (Bezirksvorsteher). The district councils are advisory only. Each district is further subdivided into boroughs. There are 50 boroughs in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nD\u00fcsseldorf has become one of the top telecommunications centres in Germany. With two of the four big German providers of mobile frequencies, D2 Vodafone and E-Plus, D\u00fcsseldorf leads the German mobile phone market.

Heinrich Heine, whose 200th birthday was celebrated in 1997 and who originally had a proposed memorial in the city dedicated to him; Clara and Robert Schumann; and as Felix Mendelssohn, are the most prominent artists related to the city, which is home to a distinguished Academy of Fine Arts.\nThe D\u00fcsseldorf cultural scene comprises traditional and avant-garde, classical and glamorous. The world-famous state art collection of North Rhine-Westphalia, the highly acclaimed Deutsche Oper am Rhein (opera), and the D\u00fcsseldorfer Schauspielhaus (theatre), artistic home of Gustaf Gr\u00fcndgens, are major elements of D\u00fcsseldorf's reputation as a centre of the fine arts.\n\n\n=== Beer ===\nD\u00fcsseldorf is well known for its Altbier, a hoppy beer which translates as old [style] beer, a reference to the pre-lager brewing method of using a warm top-fermenting yeast like British pale ales. Over time the Alt yeast adjusted to lower temperatures, and the Alt brewers would store or lager the beer after fermentation, leading to a cleaner, crisper beer. The name \"altbier\" first appeared in the 19th century to differentiate the beers of D\u00fcsseldorf from the new pale lager that was gaining a hold on Germany.Brewers in D\u00fcsseldorf used the pale malts that were used for the modern pale lagers, but retained the old (\"alt\") method of using warm fermenting yeasts. The first brewery to use the name Alt was Schumacher which opened in 1838. The founder, Mathias Schumacher, allowed the beer to mature in cool conditions in wooden casks for longer than normal, and laid the foundation for the modern alt \u2013 amber coloured and lagered. The result is a pale beer that has some of the lean dryness of a lager but with fruity notes as well.There are five pub-breweries in D\u00fcsseldorf which brew Altbier on the premises: F\u00fcchschen, Schumacher, Schl\u00fcssel, Uerige and Brauerei K\u00fcrzer. Four of the five are in the historic centre of D\u00fcsseldorf (Altstadt); the other (Schumacher), between the Altstadt and D\u00fcsseldorf Central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), also maintains an establishment in the Altstadt, Im Goldenen Kessel, across the street from Schl\u00fcssel.\nEach (except Brauerei K\u00fcrzer) produces a special, secret, seasonal \"Sticke\" version in small quantities, though the names vary: Schl\u00fcssel spells it \"Stike\", without the \"c\", while Schumacher calls its special beer \"Latzenbier\", meaning \"slat beer\", possibly because the kegs from which it was poured had been stored on raised shelves. F\u00fcchschen's seasonal is its Weihnachtsbier (Christmas beer), available in bottles starting mid-November, and served in the brewpub on Christmas Eve.\n\n\n=== Music and nightlife ===\n\nSince the 1950s the \"Kom(m)\u00f6dchen\" has been one of the most prominent political cabarets of Germany. The city's most famous contribution to the culture of modern popular music is beyond doubt the influential avant-garde electronic band Kraftwerk. Formed by a few D\u00fcsseldorf-born musicians, Kraftwerk is internationally known as the most significant band in the history of post-war German music and as pioneers in electronic music. Other influential musical groups originating from D\u00fcsseldorf include Neu!, formed in 1971 by Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother, after their split from Kraftwerk, and La D\u00fcsseldorf, also formed by Dinger in 1976 shortly after Neu! disbanded. Both groups had a significant influence on a variety of subsequent rock, post-punk, and electronic music artists.Internationally known power metal band Warlock was formed in D\u00fcsseldorf in 1982. Its frontwoman, Doro Pesch, had a successful solo career in Europe and Asia since Warlock ended. The punk band Die Toten Hosen, which is famous around the world, also the most popular singers in Germany Westernhagen and Heino come from D\u00fcsseldorf. The electronic act D.A.F. was formed in the city in 1978, as well as the electronic/industrial pioneers Die Krupps in 1980. Another famous formation is Fehlfarben. Founded in the late 1970s by Peter Hein, Frank Fenstermacher, Kurt Dahlke and Michael Kemner.\nD\u00fcsseldorf appears in several songs, including D\u00fcsseldorf by the British indie band Teleman and W\u00e4rst du doch in D\u00fcsseldorf geblieben by Danish singer Dorthe Kollo.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nD\u00fcsseldorf, Germany is the fashion capital of Germany as it is a major cultural center for the art and fashion scenes. The fashionable clothes trend took root in this city before 1949. 1949 is the date of the first fashion show staged in D\u00fcsseldorf. Fashion trends have occurred as access to more elegant clothing for the general public has been a part of the culture for almost a century. Two times a year an event called the, \u201cVoices of Fashion,\u201d occurs and attracts many people to visit D\u00fcsseldorf to find the latest fashion items. There are famous designers that have made a name for themselves in D\u00fcsseldorf as well. Designers Sabine Schumacher, Peter O. Mahler, and Renate Harvan all design in D\u00fcsseldorf.

Karneval ends on Aschermittwoch (Ash Wednesday).\n\n\n=== Cartwheeler of D\u00fcsseldorf ===\n\nThe D\u00fcsseldorfer Radschl\u00e4ger (Boy who does Cartwheels) is said to be the city's oldest tradition. The symbol of the cartwheeler can be found on many souvenirs and various things in D\u00fcsseldorf have the cartwheelers to thank for their names. This tradition was honoured in 1954 by the erection of a fountain, called Cartwheeler's Fountain, on the Burgplatz in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n==== Legends of its origin and history ====\nThe tradition cannot be linked to one specific historical event, instead, there are several stories surrounding the beginnings of the D\u00fcsseldorf Cartwheelers. Probably the most well known version is Battle of Worringen. In the battle of 1288 Count Adolf devastatingly defeated the Archbishop of Cologne. As a consequence of this victory, D\u00fcsseldorf obtained Town privileges. The inhabitants, especially the children ran joyfully on the streets and performed cartwheels.\nAnother story talks about a wedding procession during which one of the wheels of the wedding carriage broke. In order to fend off the threat of bad luck, a boy supposedly jumped to the carriage, took hold of the wheel and thus became a living part of the wheel. Whether the story is about the marriage of Jan Wellem and Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici or the wedding of Margravine Jakobea of Baden and Johann Wilhelm is debatable.\nAnother story gives an account of this wedding between Margrave Jacobe von Baden and Johann Wilhelm, in 1585. According to legend she felt miserable about her marriage, but the cartwheelers who displayed their skills next to her carriage were able to make her smile. Numerous travelers were attracted to the city by great exhibitions \u2013 the forerunner of today's fairs \u2013 between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. During this time the children who did the cart wheeling found out that it was a profitable source of income. The bourgeoisie accepted this in good humour as a symbolic act of local patriotism. In the beginning the lads shouted \"f\u00f6r eene Penning schlage ich das Rad\u201c (cartwheel for a penny). The Jan Wellem monument returned to D\u00fcsseldorf at the end of the Second World War. The procession was accompanied by torches, fanfares and the cartwheeling boys.\n\n\n===== Cartwheelers in the cityscape =====\nCartwheelers can be found by several fountains within the city and near many small landmarks. The most famous is Cartwheeler's Fountain in Burgplatz with an inscription of a quote by Hans M\u00fcller-Schl\u00f6sser: \"Radschl\u00e4ger wolle mer blieve, wie jeck et de Minschen och drieve\u201c (We will always remain cartwheelers, however crazy it drives people.) The fountain was designed by Alfred Zschorsch in 1954 and donated by the  Heimatverein D\u00fcsseldorfer Jonges, which is a club devoted to the maintenance of local and regional traditions. There are other cartwheelers that decorate storm drains and the door knocker on the Church of Lambertus, which was designed by Friedrich Becker. He created the cartwheeler in front of the Schadow Arcades.This tradition has been kept alive by the Alde D\u00fcsseldorfer B\u00fcrgergesellschaft von 1920 e. V., a society founded in 1920, who organized the first cartwheeler competition on 17 October 1937. Since 1971 this event has been held annually in cooperation with the Stadtsparkasse (a local bank), but formerly took place in the K\u00f6nigsallee. Since 2006 it has taken place on the Rheinwerft, near the old part of town. This is a fixed date in the city\u2019s calendar of events. About 500 boys regularly participate in this event and since 1971 girls have also taken part. In 2001 the art project Radschl\u00e4ger-Kunst (Cartwheeler Art) was called into life, in which over 100 cartwheeler sculptures have been designed by various artists. The door knocker on the Church of Lambertus functioned as a model for the sculptures that are 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) high, 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) wide and 30 cm (12 in) deep. They were positioned around the city centre. Some of the sculptures have been auctioned off to companies and private owners.\n\n\n=== Christmas market ===\nEvery Christmas, the city of D\u00fcsseldorf uses the city centre to host one of the largest Christmas gatherings in Germany. The Christmas festival occurs every year from 17 November until 23 December. This Christmas fest brings D\u00fcsseldorf a large portion of tourism every year as many people from nearby areas come to the city to drink mulled wine and hot chocolate and watch craftsman blow glass and create art. The event contains many small wooden buildings all clustered in the middle of the city for all the citizens to enjoy.

        "wiki": "The Grupello-Haus  (Grupello house) is a three-storey building located at 4 Marktplatz, D\u00fcsseldorf, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The original size of the building was likely half of its current size.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIt is believed to have been designed by the Italian architect Matteo Alberti in 1706 for Duke Johann Wilhelm.\nThe Duke gave the house to his Flemish court sculptor Gabri\u00ebl Grupello in 1708 and the name of the house is derived from this.  Grupello carried out an important reconstruction of the building. He used the house as the living quarters of his family and partially as a studio. Originally, two female busts representing the Greek goddesses Artemis and Aphrodite presumed to be by Grupello were placed above the portal. The original bronze statues are now in the local Stadtmuseum Landeshauptstadt D\u00fcsseldorf and have been replaced by two concrete cast replicas.In the year 1748 Elector Karl Theodor acquired the house and leased it to the painter and later Academy Director Lambert Krahe. From 1769 Governor Duke von Efferen lived in the house, which is why it is also called Gouvernementshaus (Government House). Later, the police department was housed in the building for some time. In 1818 it became property of D\u00fcsseldorf city through a donation by Prussia.Heavily damaged in the war, the house was rebuilt in a simplified form. Nothing is left from the original interior. In 1969, a new meeting room of the town hall was opened in the house and it is now used as the meeting venue for the city council.\n\n\n== References ==",

Records show that the imperial palaces had gardens by the 5th century ce, their chief characteristic being a pond with an islet connected to the shore by bridges\u2014as is shown by later references to these precedents in Emperor Sh\u014dmu\u2019s (724\u2013756) three gardens in Nara. During the Heian period (794\u20131185), when the symmetrical shinden style of architecture prevailed, the main garden was laid out on the southern side of the house. With the change of domestic architecture in the Kamakura period (1192\u20131333), however, came modifications of the garden. Learned Zen priests, who assiduously studied the art of garden making, gave Buddhistic names to different rocks in the design and linked religio-philosophic principles with landscape lore. Other beliefs further complicated garden design. With the Muromachi period (1338\u20131573) came popularization of gardens, which were designed to be enjoyed not only as views to contemplate but as microcosms to explore. The subjective mood became dominant and the gardens reflected individuality. People demanded shibumi in their gardens\u2014an unassuming quality in which refinement underlies a commonplace appearance, perceptible only to a cultivated taste. Aesthetic priests, \u201ctea men,\u201d and connoisseurs created new forms of gardens for cha-shitsu, the little pavilions or rooms built for the chanoyu (tea ceremony), and a special style developed which revolutionized Japanese garden art.Garden of the Kinkaku Temple showing the use of a shelter structure, the Golden Pavilion, as the main focal point of a landscape design, 15th century, Ky\u014dto.Consulate General of Japan, New YorkPond and moss-covered bridge, Katsura Imperial Gardens, Ky\u014dto, Japan.William G. Froelich, Jr.The succeeding vogue of designing in three different degrees of elaboration\u2014shin, gyo, and so (\u201celaborate,\u201d \u201cintermediate,\u201d and \u201cabbreviated\u201d)\u2014was also adopted for gardens. Many splendid gardens were produced in the Momoyama (1574\u20131600) and Edo (1603\u20131867) periods. The centre of garden activity gradually shifted, however, from Kyoto to Edo (Tokyo), seat of the Tokugawa shogun. At one stage there was a utilitarian development: a duck pond was added in the Hama detached palace in Tokyo and, in the Koraku-yen at Mito, space was made for the cultivation of reeds for arrow shafts and plums for military supplies. Feudal lords generally had fine gardens in their provincial homes as well. Quite a number of gardens survived the abolition of the feudal system after the Meiji Restoration of 1868, yet many celebrated gardens perished through neglect or were sacrificed to modern progress. The establishment of public parks, which were not unknown even in feudal times, was especially encouraged throughout Japan from 1873. Gardens in Western style came in with other Western modes but made little headway. The great earthquake and fire of 1923 demonstrated a utilitarian value of the Tokyo gardens: tens of thousands found safety in the parks and in large private gardens scattered throughout the city.Ritsurin Garden, Takamatsu, JapanCamera Tokyo Service ",

        "wiki": "D\u00fcsseldorf (often Dusseldorf in English sources; UK: , US: , German: [\u02c8d\u028fsl\u0329d\u0254\u0281f] (listen);  Low Franconian and Ripuarian: D\u00fcsseld\u00f6rp ([\u02c8d\u028fsl\u0329d\u0153\u0250\u032fp]); archaic Dutch: Dusseldorp) is the capital and second-largest city of the most populous German state of North Rhine-Westphalia after Cologne, and the seventh-largest city in Germany, with a population of 617,280. At the confluence of the Rhine and its tributary D\u00fcssel, the city lies in the centre of both the Rhine-Ruhr and the Rhineland Metropolitan Regions with the Cologne Bonn Region to its south and the Ruhr to its north. Most of the city lies on the right bank of the Rhine (as opposed to Cologne, whose city centre lies on the river's left bank). The city is the largest in the German Low Franconian dialect area (closely related to Dutch). \"Dorf\" meaning \"village\" in German, the \"-dorf\" suffix (English cognate: thorp) is unusual in the German-speaking area for a settlement of D\u00fcsseldorf's size.\nMercer's 2012 Quality of Living survey ranked D\u00fcsseldorf the sixth most livable city in the world. D\u00fcsseldorf Airport is Germany's third-busiest airport after those of Frankfurt and Munich, serving as the most important international airport for the inhabitants of the densely populated Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area. D\u00fcsseldorf is an international business and financial centre, renowned for its fashion and trade fairs, and is headquarters to one Fortune Global 500 and two DAX companies. Messe D\u00fcsseldorf organises nearly one fifth of premier trade shows. As second largest city of the Rhineland, D\u00fcsseldorf holds Rhenish Carnival celebrations every year in February/March, the D\u00fcsseldorf carnival celebrations being the third most popular in Germany after those held in Cologne and Mainz.There are 22 institutions of higher education in the city including the Heinrich-Heine-Universit\u00e4t D\u00fcsseldorf, the university of applied sciences (Hochschule D\u00fcsseldorf), the academy of arts (Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf) (Joseph Beuys, Emanuel Leutze, August Macke, Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, and Andreas Gursky), and the university of music (Robert-Schumann-Musikhochschule D\u00fcsseldorf). The city is also known for its pioneering influence on electronic/experimental music (Kraftwerk) and its Japanese community.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early development ===\nWhen the Roman Empire was strengthening its position throughout Europe, a few Germanic tribes clung on in marshy territory off the eastern banks of the Rhine. In the 7th and 8th centuries, the odd farming or fishing settlement could be found at the point where the small river D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine. It was from such settlements that the city of D\u00fcsseldorf grew.\n\nThe first written mention of D\u00fcsseldorf (then called Dusseldorp in the local Low Rhenish dialect) dates back to 1135. Under Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa the small town of Kaiserswerth to the north of D\u00fcsseldorf became a well-fortified outpost, where soldiers kept a watchful eye on every movement on the Rhine. Kaiserswerth eventually became a suburb of D\u00fcsseldorf in 1929. In 1186, D\u00fcsseldorf came under the rule of the Counts of Berg. 14 August 1288 is one of the most important dates in the history of D\u00fcsseldorf. On this day the sovereign Count Adolf VIII of Berg granted the village on the banks of the D\u00fcssel town privileges. Before this, a bloody struggle for power had taken place between the Archbishop of Cologne and the count of Berg, culminating in the Battle of Worringen.\n\nThe Archbishop of Cologne's forces were wiped out by the forces of the count of Berg who were supported by citizens and farmers of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf, paving the way for D\u00fcsseldorf's elevation to city status, which is commemorated today by a monument on the Burgplatz. The custom of turning cartwheels is credited to the children of D\u00fcsseldorf. There are variations of the origin of the cartwheeling children. Today the symbol (Der Radschl\u00e4ger) represents the story and every year the D\u00fcsseldorfers celebrate by having a cartwheeling contest. After this battle the relationship between the four cities deteriorated, because they were commercial rivals; it is often said that there is a kind of hostility between the citizens of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf. Today, it finds its expression mainly in a humorous form (especially during the Rhineland Karneval) and in sports.A market square sprang up on the banks of the Rhine and the square was protected by city walls on all four sides. In 1380, the dukes of Berg moved their seat to the town and D\u00fcsseldorf was made regional capital of the Duchy of Berg. During the following centuries several famous landmarks were built, including the Collegiate Church of St Lambertus. In 1609, the ducal line of the United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg died out, and after a virulent struggle over succession, J\u00fclich and Berg fell to the Wittelsbach Counts of Palatinate-Neuburg, who made D\u00fcsseldorf their main domicile, even after they inherited the Electorate of the Palatinate, in 1685, becoming now Prince-electors as Electors Palatine.Under the art-loving Johann Wilhelm II (r. 1690\u20131716), a vast art gallery with a huge selection of paintings and sculptures, were housed in the Stadtschloss (city castle). After his death, the city fell on hard times again, especially after Elector Charles Theodore inherited Bavaria and moved the electoral court to Munich. With him he took the art collection, which became part of what is now the Alte Pinakothek in Munich. Destruction and poverty struck D\u00fcsseldorf after the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon made Berg a Grand Duchy and D\u00fcsseldorf its capital. Johann Devaranne, a leader of Solingen's resistance to Napoleon's conscription decrees, was executed here in 1813. After Napoleon's defeat, the whole Rhineland including Berg was given to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815. The Rhine Province's parliament was established in D\u00fcsseldorf. By the mid-19th century, D\u00fcsseldorf enjoyed a revival thanks to the Industrial Revolution as the city boasted 100,000 inhabitants by 1882; the figure doubled in 1892.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nDuring World War I the Royal Naval Air Service (RNS) undertook the first Entente strategic bombing missions on 22 September 1914, when it bombed the Zeppelin bases in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\nIn 1920, D\u00fcsseldorf became the centre of the General Strike. On 15 April 1920, 45 delegates of the German Miners Union were murdered by the Freikorps.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nThe city was a target of strategic bombing during World War II, particularly during the RAF bombing campaign in 1943 when over 700 bombers were used in a single night. Raids continued late into the war. As part of the campaign against German oil facilities, the RAF raid of 20\u201321 February on the Rhenania Ossag refinery in the Reisholz district of the city halted oil production there. The Allied ground advance into Germany reached D\u00fcsseldorf in mid-April 1945. The United States 97th Infantry Division easily captured the city on 18 April 1945, after the local German Resistance group launched Aktion Rheinland.\n\n\n=== German Federal Republic ===\nIn 1946, D\u00fcsseldorf was made capital of the new federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The city's reconstruction proceeded at a frantic pace and the economic transformation guided D\u00fcsseldorf's economic growth.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Physical geography ===\n\nD\u00fcsseldorf lies at the centre of the Lower Rhine basin, where the delta of the D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine. The city lies on the east side of the Rhine, except District 4 (Oberkassel, Niederkassel, Heerdt and L\u00f6rick).\nAcross the Rhine, the city of Neuss stands on the delta of the Erft. D\u00fcsseldorf lies southwest of the Ruhr urban area, and in the middle of the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region.\nD\u00fcsseldorf is built entirely on alluvium, mud, sand, clay and occasionally gravel. The highest point in D\u00fcsseldorf is the top of Sandberg in the far eastern part of the city (Hubbelrath borough) at 165 metres (541 ft). The lowest point is at the far northern end in Wittlaer borough where the Schwarzbach enters the Rhine, with an average elevation of 28 metres (92 ft).\n\n\n=== Adjacent cities and districts ===\nThe following districts and cities border D\u00fcsseldorf (clockwise starting from the north): the City of Duisburg, the District of Mettmann (Ratingen, Mettmann, Erkrath, Hilden, Langenfeld, and Monheim), and the District of Neuss (Dormagen, Neuss, and Meerbusch).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe city has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb, mild in relation to East Germany). Like the rest of the lower Rhineland, D\u00fcsseldorf experiences moderate winters with little snowfall and mild to warm summers. The average annual temperature is 10.6 \u00b0C (51 \u00b0F) with an average yearly precipitation of 797 millimetres (31 in). The dominant wind direction is from the west with velocities in the range of 3 to 4 m/s (7\u20139 mph), with gusts of 3.5 \u22124.8 m/s (8\u201310.7 mph). The wind is calm (defined as being under 2 m/s or 4.5 mph) about 35% of the time, more frequently at night and in the winter.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nWith a population of 612,178 within the city boundaries (31 December 2015), D\u00fcsseldorf is Germany's seventh largest city. Its population surpassed the threshold of 100,000 inhabitants during the height of industrialisation in 1882, and peaked at just over 705,000 in 1962. The city then began to lose residents with many moving into neighbouring municipalities. However, since the late 1990s, the city's population has been slowly rising again.\nA total of 109,883 (18%) of D\u00fcsseldorf's population are foreigners (31 December 2008), the majority of whom come from within Europe (81,742). The largest national minorities are Turks, Greeks, and Poles. D\u00fcsseldorf and its surroundings have the third-largest Japanese community in Europe and the largest in Germany (about 11,000 people). D\u00fcsseldorf has the third-largest Jewish community in Germany, with about 7,000 members.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Mayors ===\n\n\n=== Districts ===\n\nSince 1975, D\u00fcsseldorf is divided into ten administrative districts. Each district (Bezirk) has its own elected district council (Bezirksvertretung) and its own district mayor (Bezirksvorsteher). The district councils are advisory only. Each district is further subdivided into boroughs. There are 50 boroughs in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nD\u00fcsseldorf has become one of the top telecommunications centres in Germany. With two of the four big German providers of mobile frequencies, D2 Vodafone and E-Plus, D\u00fcsseldorf leads the German mobile phone market. There are many foreign information and communication technology companies in D\u00fcsseldorf such as Huawei, NTT, Ericsson, Nokia, and GTS.. There are 18 internet service providers located in the capital of North-Rhine Westphalia. There are two airlines with headquarters in the city: Eurowings and formerly independent LTU International.Many of the internet companies in D\u00fcsseldorf have their roots in the world of advertising: there are 400 advertising agencies in D\u00fcsseldorf, among them three of the largest in Germany: BBDO Group, Grey Global Group and Publicis. A number of affiliates of foreign agencies deserve mention as well, such as Ogilvy & Mather, Dentsu, Hakuhodo, and DDB. There are also about 200 publishing houses in D\u00fcsseldorf.\nPeek & Cloppenburg (fashion); Uniper (electricity generation); L'Or\u00e9al Germany (Cosmetics and Beauty); Henkel AG & Co. KGaA (Branded Consumer Goods and Industrial technologies); Metro (wholesale, retail); Ceconomy (retail); Esprit Holdings (fashion, headquarters in Ratingen near D\u00fcsseldorf); BASF Personal Care & Nutrition (formerly Cognis \u2013 chemicals, headquarter in Monheim near D\u00fcsseldorf, but production mainly in D\u00fcsseldorf).Daimler AG builds the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter light commercial vehicles in D\u00fcsseldorf.\nSince the 1960s, there has been a strong relationship between the city and Japan. Many Japanese banks and corporations have their European headquarters in D\u00fcsseldorf \u2013 so many that D\u00fcsseldorf has the third largest Japanese community in Europe, after London and Paris.The \"K\u00f6\", which stands for K\u00f6nigsallee (\"King's Avenue\"), is a shopping destination. Some jewellery shops, designer labels, and galleries have their stores here. The K\u00f6 has among the highest rents for retail and office space in Germany.\n\n\n=== Financial center ===\nThe city is also an important financial center. More than 30.000 people are working for the financial and insurance sector in D\u00fcsseldorf. There are around 170 national and international financial institutions, and about 130 insurance agencies, and one of Germany's eight stock exchanges.

Heinrich Heine, whose 200th birthday was celebrated in 1997 and who originally had a proposed memorial in the city dedicated to him; Clara and Robert Schumann; and as Felix Mendelssohn, are the most prominent artists related to the city, which is home to a distinguished Academy of Fine Arts.\nThe D\u00fcsseldorf cultural scene comprises traditional and avant-garde, classical and glamorous. The world-famous state art collection of North Rhine-Westphalia, the highly acclaimed Deutsche Oper am Rhein (opera), and the D\u00fcsseldorfer Schauspielhaus (theatre), artistic home of Gustaf Gr\u00fcndgens, are major elements of D\u00fcsseldorf's reputation as a centre of the fine arts.\n\n\n=== Beer ===\nD\u00fcsseldorf is well known for its Altbier, a hoppy beer which translates as old [style] beer, a reference to the pre-lager brewing method of using a warm top-fermenting yeast like British pale ales. Over time the Alt yeast adjusted to lower temperatures, and the Alt brewers would store or lager the beer after fermentation, leading to a cleaner, crisper beer. The name \"altbier\" first appeared in the 19th century to differentiate the beers of D\u00fcsseldorf from the new pale lager that was gaining a hold on Germany.Brewers in D\u00fcsseldorf used the pale malts that were used for the modern pale lagers, but retained the old (\"alt\") method of using warm fermenting yeasts. The first brewery to use the name Alt was Schumacher which opened in 1838. The founder, Mathias Schumacher, allowed the beer to mature in cool conditions in wooden casks for longer than normal, and laid the foundation for the modern alt \u2013 amber coloured and lagered. The result is a pale beer that has some of the lean dryness of a lager but with fruity notes as well.There are five pub-breweries in D\u00fcsseldorf which brew Altbier on the premises: F\u00fcchschen, Schumacher, Schl\u00fcssel, Uerige and Brauerei K\u00fcrzer. Four of the five are in the historic centre of D\u00fcsseldorf (Altstadt); the other (Schumacher), between the Altstadt and D\u00fcsseldorf Central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), also maintains an establishment in the Altstadt, Im Goldenen Kessel, across the street from Schl\u00fcssel.\nEach (except Brauerei K\u00fcrzer) produces a special, secret, seasonal \"Sticke\" version in small quantities, though the names vary: Schl\u00fcssel spells it \"Stike\", without the \"c\", while Schumacher calls its special beer \"Latzenbier\", meaning \"slat beer\", possibly because the kegs from which it was poured had been stored on raised shelves. F\u00fcchschen's seasonal is its Weihnachtsbier (Christmas beer), available in bottles starting mid-November, and served in the brewpub on Christmas Eve.\n\n\n=== Music and nightlife ===\n\nSince the 1950s the \"Kom(m)\u00f6dchen\" has been one of the most prominent political cabarets of Germany. The city's most famous contribution to the culture of modern popular music is beyond doubt the influential avant-garde electronic band Kraftwerk. Formed by a few D\u00fcsseldorf-born musicians, Kraftwerk is internationally known as the most significant band in the history of post-war German music and as pioneers in electronic music. Other influential musical groups originating from D\u00fcsseldorf include Neu!, formed in 1971 by Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother, after their split from Kraftwerk, and La D\u00fcsseldorf, also formed by Dinger in 1976 shortly after Neu! disbanded. Both groups had a significant influence on a variety of subsequent rock, post-punk, and electronic music artists.Internationally known power metal band Warlock was formed in D\u00fcsseldorf in 1982. Its frontwoman, Doro Pesch, had a successful solo career in Europe and Asia since Warlock ended. The punk band Die Toten Hosen, which is famous around the world, also the most popular singers in Germany Westernhagen and Heino come from D\u00fcsseldorf. The electronic act D.A.F. was formed in the city in 1978, as well as the electronic/industrial pioneers Die Krupps in 1980. Another famous formation is Fehlfarben. Founded in the late 1970s by Peter Hein, Frank Fenstermacher, Kurt Dahlke and Michael Kemner.\nD\u00fcsseldorf appears in several songs, including D\u00fcsseldorf by the British indie band Teleman and W\u00e4rst du doch in D\u00fcsseldorf geblieben by Danish singer Dorthe Kollo.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nD\u00fcsseldorf, Germany is the fashion capital of Germany as it is a major cultural center for the art and fashion scenes. The fashionable clothes trend took root in this city before 1949. 1949 is the date of the first fashion show staged in D\u00fcsseldorf. Fashion trends have occurred as access to more elegant clothing for the general public has been a part of the culture for almost a century. Two times a year an event called the, \u201cVoices of Fashion,\u201d occurs and attracts many people to visit D\u00fcsseldorf to find the latest fashion items. There are famous designers that have made a name for themselves in D\u00fcsseldorf as well. Designers Sabine Schumacher, Peter O. Mahler, and Renate Harvan all design in D\u00fcsseldorf. To keep the creativity and passion for fashion alive in D\u00fcsseldorf everyday there are schools dedicated to fashion design in D\u00fcsseldorf as well. Akademie Mode and Design Institution, Design Department Academy, and Mode Design College are the three prominent fashion schools residing in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n=== Carnival ===\n\nOne of the biggest cultural events in D\u00fcsseldorf is the Karneval (also referred to as the \"fifth season\") which starts every year on 11 November at 11:11 a.m., and reaches its climax on Rosenmontag (Rose Monday), featuring a huge parade through the streets of D\u00fcsseldorf. Karneval ends on Aschermittwoch (Ash Wednesday).\n\n\n=== Cartwheeler of D\u00fcsseldorf ===\n\nThe D\u00fcsseldorfer Radschl\u00e4ger (Boy who does Cartwheels) is said to be the city's oldest tradition. The symbol of the cartwheeler can be found on many souvenirs and various things in D\u00fcsseldorf have the cartwheelers to thank for their names. This tradition was honoured in 1954 by the erection of a fountain, called Cartwheeler's Fountain, on the Burgplatz in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n==== Legends of its origin and history ====\nThe tradition cannot be linked to one specific historical event, instead, there are several stories surrounding the beginnings of the D\u00fcsseldorf Cartwheelers. Probably the most well known version is Battle of Worringen. In the battle of 1288 Count Adolf devastatingly defeated the Archbishop of Cologne. As a consequence of this victory, D\u00fcsseldorf obtained Town privileges. The inhabitants, especially the children ran joyfully on the streets and performed cartwheels.\nAnother story talks about a wedding procession during which one of the wheels of the wedding carriage broke. In order to fend off the threat of bad luck, a boy supposedly jumped to the carriage, took hold of the wheel and thus became a living part of the wheel. Whether the story is about the marriage of Jan Wellem and Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici or the wedding of Margravine Jakobea of Baden and Johann Wilhelm is debatable.\nAnother story gives an account of this wedding between Margrave Jacobe von Baden and Johann Wilhelm, in 1585. According to legend she felt miserable about her marriage, but the cartwheelers who displayed their skills next to her carriage were able to make her smile. Numerous travelers were attracted to the city by great exhibitions \u2013 the forerunner of today's fairs \u2013 between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. During this time the children who did the cart wheeling found out that it was a profitable source of income. The bourgeoisie accepted this in good humour as a symbolic act of local patriotism. In the beginning the lads shouted \"f\u00f6r eene Penning schlage ich das Rad\u201c (cartwheel for a penny). The Jan Wellem monument returned to D\u00fcsseldorf at the end of the Second World War. The procession was accompanied by torches, fanfares and the cartwheeling boys.\n\n\n===== Cartwheelers in the cityscape =====\nCartwheelers can be found by several fountains within the city and near many small landmarks. The most famous is Cartwheeler's Fountain in Burgplatz with an inscription of a quote by Hans M\u00fcller-Schl\u00f6sser: \"Radschl\u00e4ger wolle mer blieve, wie jeck et de Minschen och drieve\u201c (We will always remain cartwheelers, however crazy it drives people.) The fountain was designed by Alfred Zschorsch in 1954 and donated by the  Heimatverein D\u00fcsseldorfer Jonges, which is a club devoted to the maintenance of local and regional traditions. There are other cartwheelers that decorate storm drains and the door knocker on the Church of Lambertus, which was designed by Friedrich Becker. He created the cartwheeler in front of the Schadow Arcades.This tradition has been kept alive by the Alde D\u00fcsseldorfer B\u00fcrgergesellschaft von 1920 e. V., a society founded in 1920, who organized the first cartwheeler competition on 17 October 1937. Since 1971 this event has been held annually in cooperation with the Stadtsparkasse (a local bank), but formerly took place in the K\u00f6nigsallee. Since 2006 it has taken place on the Rheinwerft, near the old part of town. This is a fixed date in the city\u2019s calendar of events. About 500 boys regularly participate in this event and since 1971 girls have also taken part. In 2001 the art project Radschl\u00e4ger-Kunst (Cartwheeler Art) was called into life, in which over 100 cartwheeler sculptures have been designed by various artists. The door knocker on the Church of Lambertus functioned as a model for the sculptures that are 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) high, 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) wide and 30 cm (12 in) deep. They were positioned around the city centre. Some of the sculptures have been auctioned off to companies and private owners.\n\n\n=== Christmas market ===\nEvery Christmas, the city of D\u00fcsseldorf uses the city centre to host one of the largest Christmas gatherings in Germany. The Christmas festival occurs every year from 17 November until 23 December. This Christmas fest brings D\u00fcsseldorf a large portion of tourism every year as many people from nearby areas come to the city to drink mulled wine and hot chocolate and watch craftsman blow glass and create art. The event contains many small wooden buildings all clustered in the middle of the city for all the citizens to enjoy. The event, to many visitors, has an old European feel, but is very lively.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nTraditional meals in the region are Rheinischer Sauerbraten (a beef roast and sometimes horse marinated for a few days in vinegar and spices served with gravy and raisins) and Heaven and Earth (Himmel und \u00c4d; black pudding with stewed apples mixed with mashed potatoes).

Also a special meal: D\u00fcsseldorfer Senfrostbraten (Steaks roasted with D\u00fcsseldorf mustard on top).\nD\u00fcsseldorf is known for its strong Dijon-like mustard served in a traditional pot called \"Mostertp\u00f6ttche\", which was eternalised in a still life by Vincent van Gogh in 1884.The Rhine Metropolis is one of the most diverse areas in terms of culinary diversity.

          "Amazing exhibit of classic vehicles. Smaller than their Remise in Berlin, but still worth the visit.",
          "Well worth a visit,we spent all day there. Good retuarant and a wide variety of exotic cars to spend your lottery winnings on.",
          "My son and I are involved in the classic cars business in the UK and went to take a look at Classic Remise as we were in Dusseldorf. Lovely retail location but they let you wander around like its a museum. A 308GTB caught our eye because it was an early, 'tall tyre' possibly",

          "I went here a couple years ago when I was traveling for work. I had a couple hours to spare before I had to get to the airport so I went down and had a look. Absolutely amazing place with a crazy car collection. Well worth my trip across town to check it out. I took like 500",
          "Wonderful place! A lots of cars, mainly from 50's up to 80's. Big advantage - entrance for free! Be extremely careful, because in one moment You will be purchaser instead of touristical visitor. Of course if your wallet is big enough. ;-)",
          "At must to go to if your remotely interested in cars, old to flash new cars, no entry fee. Had a nice meal while you are there.",
          "We really enjoyed spending about an hour and a half walking around and looking at the cars. Wish there was a little more information about them around. Ate at the restaurant, it was good and inexpensive.",
          "Great place to visit, excellent restaurant on the inside very friendly staff would recommend to visit with the family, the time to ge is very ample since it's open until 10 pm",
          "I\u2019m an avid car guy. It took some searching to find from the train. It nested behind what I call a townhouse area or subdivision. I used maps me offline maps and walked straight to it from the train about a fifteen minute walk that was easy to do. It\u2019s free to enter and walk",
          "My son is a complete Petrolhead so on arriving in D\u00fcsseldorf a visit to the motor museum was inevitable. We\u2019ve been to many car museums around Europe and this one didn\u2019t disappoint . The cars are mostly nicely laid out around what appeared to be a large aircraft hangar. There",
          "This was my second time visiting Classic Remise. Its a decent taxi ride from the Messe - over \u20ac50 however a great way to while away a few hours before a late flight home. The Classic Remise is a collection of High End Classic Car and Motorbike Dealers, Shops selling Automobilia",
          "A wonderful place, amazing cars you can never see in your life some of them I never knew that existed, you can walk and look at them, old or new no matter what they are just wonderful !",

          "We had a great time at Classic Remise D\u00fcsseldorf and it's a must-see for classic car enthusiasts. We enjoyed a really good, reasonably-priced lunch at the central restaurant (on the site of the old train turntable). The pizza was excellent and big, plenty for two and, of course,",

          "The musea is free but you have to have a sticker to visit it by car. it's also open in sunday and it's really worth a visit on a rainy day. There are a lot of different cars and there is a good place to eat and drink",
          "Great place to visit on a Sunday if you are interested in classic and not so old classic cars- I guess some are probably almost 100 years old to relatively new collectors cars. The restaurant is quite good too so worth trying while here too. This is a large showroom, I think it",
          "As nothing gives a teenager a better break from travel classics than this type of place. It delivered. The mere fact that this is not a museum but rather a rare car models sale/presentation site did not bother at all. An enthusiast shall pick up the cherries.",

          "We have just returned from a four night visit to Dusseldorf with another couple. My husband has always been a classic car enthusiast and I found Classic Remise on line before we left UK. We took a taxi from our hotel (22 euros) and were not disappointed. This place is",

          "If you love cars... and who doesn't? Then you've got to visit here when in D\u00fcsseldorf. A full train roundhouse full of classic and exotic cars. This is a museum of automotive art - and it's free! Just walk in. Some are for sale. Some need restoration. And some are in",
          "This is a hidden gem in Dusseldorf. It's a car lovers paradise whith the bonus of a restaurant/bar. It has a varied selection of cars from all eras and also does service and repair work. Well worth a visit and 10 mins from centre of Dusseldorf on the tram.",
          "I visited here with my husband whose a petrol head , we\u2019ve also been previously to its sister classic remise Berlin. This I think is the better of the two but both great . There are so many beautiful cars to look at and dream of one day owning one .we spent a couple of hours",

          "I am not a car nut, they are just there to get me from a to b. However even I enjoyed a visit to this old railway shed to see lots of old and interesting cars that are for sale. The cafe was also a welcome break. Not far from the city centre , I rented a bike and cycled.",
          "We went there to see the cars which was a pretty cool find and enjoyed a couple of beers. The menu looked good though and it's surprisingly cheap! Worth a visit!",

          "Wow... that's all I can say... this museum is not like your regular boring place, there is a very reasonably priced restaurant in the center of the exhibit where you see most every car displayed. Some cars are for sale, some are just stored. There is also hundreds of motor",
          "We were shocked that it was free to just roam around inside. The cars were pretty awesome although there are a lot of European models (and we\u2019re from the states). Regardless worth a visit. There also appeared to be a restaurant inside. If we would have known we would have come",
          "A full day out in one place. Plus it's FREE! A bit out of the way. But well worth the walk. CArs cars cars. So many great classics in one place. Plus a great cafe. Food, coffee and beer/cocktails! What more could a pertrol head want!",

          "Hundreds of antique and not-so-antique cars.If you are tired of looking at the cars, you can sit in the restaurant and have lunch, which is not expensive and very delicious.",
          "Lovely collection of cars and motorcycles a short tra ride from the centre. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "This is an excellent opportunity to see some of the rarest, expensive, sought after and immaculately restored or looked after vehicles including farming units. Never seen or heard about a Porsche tractor which looked like similar to Massey Ferguson before. An Auto Union original",
          "I had arrived D\u00fcsseldorf at 4.30 pm after a 5 hour drive and thought should I visit this place or not!

        "wiki": "The Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen is the art collection of the German Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia, in D\u00fcsseldorf. United by this institution are three different exhibition venues: the K20 at Grabbeplatz, the K21 in the St\u00e4ndehaus, and the Schmela Haus. The Kunstsammlung was founded in 1961 by the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia as a foundation under private law for the purpose of displaying the art collection and expanding it through new acquisitions.\nDuring its 50-year history, the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen has earned an international reputation as a museum for the art of the 20th century. For some time now, however, the chronological spectrum of the collection\u2014which was initiated through the purchase of works by Paul Klee\u2014has extended up to the immediate present. The building at Grabbeplatz (K20), with its characteristic black granite fa\u00e7ade, was inaugurated in 1986. An extension building was completed in 2010.\nWith major works by Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and Piet Mondrian, among others, as well as a wide-ranging ensemble of circa 100 drawings and paintings by Paul Klee, the permanent collection of the Kunstsammlung offers a singular perspective of classical modernism. The collection of postwar American art includes works by Jackson Pollock and Frank Stella and by pop artists Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, and Andy Warhol; other high points of the collection are works by Joseph Beuys, Gerhard Richter, Tony Cragg, Emil Schumacher, Sarah Morris, Katharina Fritsch, Nam June Paik, Wolf Vostell and Imi Knoebel.\nOpened in spring of 2002 as an additional venue of the Kunstsammlung was the St\u00e4ndehaus (K21) set alongside the Kaiserteich, a building which formerly served as the seat of the Parliament of North Rhine-Westphalia. Among the highlights on view there are a number of artist's rooms and large-scale installations, a special focus of this portion of the collection.\nThe Schmela Haus, in D\u00fcsseldorf's historic district, joined the Kunstsammlung in 2009 as a \"rehearsal stage\" and lecture venue. When it first opened in 1971, this protected landmark by Dutch architect Aldo van Eyck was home to the Galerie Alfred Schmela and was the first building to be erected in the Federal Republic of Germany expressly as an art gallery. Since spring of 2011, the Schmela Haus is also used again for exhibitions.\nAs an institution with three locations, the Kunstsammlung has more than 10,000 m2 (110,000 sq ft) of exhibition surface at its disposal.\nWith its accompanying programs and special projects, the Education Department strives to make the works held in the Regional Collection accessible to visitors of all ages. Available for this purpose are a number of studios, a media workshop, and a \"laboratory\" which is integrated into the exhibition galleries.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe history of the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen begins in 1960 with the purchase of 88 works by Paul Klee from the collection of Pittsburgh steel manufacturer G. David Thompson. The purchase\u2014brokered by Basel art dealer Ernst Beyeler and overseen by then state premiere Franz Meyer\u2014forms the nucleus of the collection, founded in 1961 under the title \"Stiftung Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen\". Between 1962 and his retirement in 1990, Werner Schmalenbach served as the first director of the newly founded collection. He assembled an extraordinarily high-quality collection of classical modernist artworks, thereby creating the only regional collection in Germany specializing in modern art. To begin with, the collection was housed in J\u00e4gerhof Palace. Soon after it opened, space limitations prompted plans for a new building. Announced in 1975 was a competition for its design; the winning proposal was submitted by the Danish architectural office of Dissing+Weitling. The building \u2013 which resides within architectural history at the transition from postwar modernism to postmodernism \u2013 was inaugurated on 14 March 1986 in the presence of the then German President Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker, and has served ever since as an emblem of the city. With its curved fa\u00e7ade of polished, natural black stone, the building gives Grabbeplatz its special character. It sits on the square directly across from the Kunsthalle D\u00fcsseldorf, whose building also serves as the headquarters of the Kunstverein f\u00fcr die Rheinlande und Westfalen.\nIn 1990, Schmalenbach was succeeded as Director by Armin Zweite, formerly head of the St\u00e4dtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus in Munich. While Schmalenbach had expanded the museum's holdings for the most part through the addition of masterworks of painting, it was primarily contemporary sculptures, installations, and photographs of international rank which entered the collection beginning in 1990 through the efforts of his successor. On 1 September 2009, Marion Ackermann \u2013 former director of the Kunstmuseum Stuttgart \u2013 assumed artistic directorship of the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen. She has taken a dynamic approach to the collection, and seeks to relate contemporary art and classic modern to one another more closely. Together with Hagen Lippe-Wei\u00dfenfeld, who joined the team on 1 November 2008 as Director of Finance and Business Affairs, Ackermann serves on the Chairmanship of the Foundation.\n\nOn 12 November 2009, the Kunstsammlung inaugurated the former home of the Galerie Schmela, located at Mutter-Ey-Stra\u00dfe 3 in D\u00fcsseldorf-Altstadt, as a venue for exhibitions, discussions and other activities.\nAfter remaining closed for more than two years during comprehensive renovations and the erection of an extension building, the K20 at Grabbeplatz resumed operations as an exhibition venue in July 2010. Available now for the collection and for temporary exhibitions is a generous surface area. The first artists to exhibit there were Belgian illustrator Kris Martin and German sculptor Michael Sailstorfer, who created accessible installations for the two galleries of the new building, namely the Klee Halle and the Konrad und Gabriele Henkel Galerie, which together offer almost 2.000 m\u00b2.\nDuring the first two weeks after the reopening alone, nearly 60,000 visitors took advantage of free admission to the Kunstsammlung. The museum welcomed its 100,000th visitor on 21 October 2010. Contributing to the new and more emphatic public presence of the Kunstsammlung \u2013 which is now able to display the art collections of this federal state more comprehensively than ever before \u2013 is the large-scale mosaic mural \"Hornet\", composed of colorful tiles and the work of American artist Sarah Morris. With its length of 27 meters, it has become attractive landmark on the newly created Paul Klee Platz along the rear fa\u00e7ade of the K20.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nFeatured on a regular basis in the venues of the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen alongside presentations of the permanent collection are internationally acclaimed temporary exhibitions.\nOn view from 11 September 2010 to 16 January 2011 in the K20 and the Schmela Haus was the ambitious Joseph Beuys exhibition \"Parallelprozesse/Parallel Processes\", organized around large-scale installation works dating from all creative periods of this artist. This exhibition \u2013 the first special presentation mounted after the reopening of the Kunstsammlung am Grabbeplatz \u2013 formed part of the program of the D\u00fcsseldorf Quadriennale, and was seen by 103,000 visitors.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== The K20 am Grabbeplatz ===\nThe building which houses the Kunstsammlung K20 am Grabbeplatz, with its distinctive fa\u00e7ade of black Bornholm granite, was opened in 1986. Working in the tradition of Arne Jacobsen, the Copenhagen architecture office of Dissing+Weitling created a building which features details typical of its time and positions the qualities of the artworks on display in the foreground.\nThe entrance area opens onto the Grabbe Halle on the same level, the building's tallest gallery space, which features 14-metre ceilings. Used for temporary exhibitions, this hall measures 600 m\u00b2 and is free of supporting pillars.\nFrom the lobby, three single-flight staircases arranged one behind the next provide access to the two upper storeys. Like the galleries in the 2nd upper storey, the large hall in the 1st upper storey enjoys natural top lighting.\nThe foundation stone for the extension was laid in 2008 and the new building was inaugurated in July 2010. Realized by the same architectural office, the new building perpetuates the architectural idiom of the original structure. During the two-year-long period of closure, the original building was completely renovated and brought up to current technical standards.\nAvailable now in the two new exhibition halls of the extension building \u2013 both free of supporting pillars \u2013 are altogether 2000 m\u00b2 of surface area. The Klee Halle is positioned on the right-hand side of the foyer of the old building, and is mainly used for temporary exhibitions. With a clearance space of 6.4 m, the hall is illuminated artificially by more than 500 spotlights. A narrow staircase in the rear connects the ground floor level with the new upper hall. The entire exhibition surface of the Kunstsammlung am Grabbeplatz now amounts to more than 5000 m\u00b2.\n\n\n=== The K21 in the St\u00e4ndehaus ===\nOn 18 April 2002, the museum building known as the St\u00e4ndehaus am Kaiserteich was inaugurated in the presence of German then President Johannes Rau, and became the second main pillar of the Kunstsammlung for modern and contemporary art.\nBetween 1876 and 1880, the St\u00e4ndehaus in D\u00fcsseldorf was erected in the historicist neo-Renaissance style by architect Julius Raschdorff. For many years, the St\u00e4ndehaus accommodated the Provincial Diet of the Prussian province of the Rhineland. The Parliament of the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia met there between 1949 and 1988. Following the relocation of the Parliament, the St\u00e4ndehaus remained empty and unused for 14 years.\nSurrounding the building's central public square \u2013 which takes the form of a spacious piazza \u2013 are four wings containing continuous arcade passageways. The three-year conversion of this representative building in the historicist style was undertaken by the architects Kiessler+Partner of Munich. They created a modern museum building with a striking glazed domed roof in the form of an elongated cloister vault, composed of 1919 sheets of glass, which shapes the building's aesthetic appearance.\nWhile the outer fa\u00e7ade has been preserved, nearly all original fixtures were removed from the interior. The historic staircase was retained, and now leads to the galleries in the three upper stories. The flexible exhibition galleries in the basement level, together with the upper rooms, add up to altogether 5300 m\u00b2 of exhibition surface.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== The Schmela Haus ===\nThe Schmela Haus was built by Dutch architect Aldo van Eyck (1918\u20131999), a key representative of structuralist architecture. Inaugurated in 1971, and now under landmarks protection, it was the first building in the Federal German Republic to be erected specifically as a private art gallery. The five-story building, built from gray pumice, is characterized by its interplay of interior and exterior and between its private residential and public exhibition spaces. The building was purchased by the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia after being vacated by the gallery.\n51\u00b013\u203238\u2033N 6\u00b046\u203232\u2033E\n\n\n== Collection ==\n\nThe collection encompasses a singular selection of works from the 20th and 21st centuries. Among the high points are paintings by the German Expressionists, Pablo Picasso, Wassily Kandinsky and Jackson Pollock, and installations by Joseph Beuys and Nam June Paik. Alongside these works, which have long since achieved iconic status, are additional outstanding examples of classical modernism, of American art after 1945, along with major installation works, photographs, and film and video pieces by contemporary artists. Critics have referred to the collection \u2013 whose individual works are notable for their outstanding quality \u2013 as a \"secret National Gallery\".The focus of the collection is classical modernism. Stylistically, the works from before 1945 range from Fauvism, Expressionism, Pittura Metafisica, and Cubism to works by members of the Blaue Reiter group, as well as Dada and Surrealism. The collection also includes 100 works by Paul Klee. In 1960, the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia earmarked 6 million German Marks for the purchase of 88 paintings, drawings, and color studies on paper by Klee \u2013 an ensemble which formed the nucleus of the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen. Although the price tag seemed high at the time, it appears a rare bargain from today's perspective. The works came from a private American collection in Pittsburgh.\nAmong groups of works by individual artists is an ensemble of 12 by Pablo Picasso which encompasses nearly all of the major creative phases of his career. Cubism forms an important focus of the collection, with works in the style by Pablo Picasso, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Juan Gris, Georges Braque and others.\nArt after 1945 is represented primarily by circa 40 major pieces by American artists. Among these are works by Mark Rothko, Robert Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol, Donald Judd and Jackson Pollock, whose monumental Number 32 from 1950 is one of the few mural-sized drip paintings by this artist, and is regarded as a key exemplar of Abstract Expressionism. Among the four works by Robert Rauschenberg is Wager, which dates from 1957 and is one of the largest and most complex of his \"combine paintings\".\nEuropean postwar art is represented among others by the works of Markus L\u00fcpertz, Per Kirkeby, Gerhard Richter, Emil Schumacher and Joseph Beuys, whose late work  \"Palazzo Regale\", acquired in 1992, has been supplemented by a further 60 works. These were formerly owned by D\u00fcsseldorf art collector G\u00fcnter Ulbricht.\nInstallations and artist's rooms are an important focus of the Kunstsammlung, an area which has been expanded continuously in recent years (through works by Marcel Broodthaers, for example). German photography is represented in the collection by the works of Bernd and Hilla Becher and other exponents of the D\u00fcsseldorf School of photographers. In the realm of new media, i.e. film and video, the collection continues to expand, and presently contains around 90 works.\nIn 2005, the private collection of Simone and Heinz Ackermans, which contained 150 works of international contemporary art, was acquired by the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia following the display of selected works from the collection at the K21 from 2002 to 2005. The focus of the Ackermans Collection is art since the 1980s, on figurative sculpture, photographic works, installations, as well as film and video works.\n\n\n== Patrons ==\n                                                                                                             \nThe Gesellschaft der Freunde der Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen e.V. (Society of Friends of the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen) has provided the Kunstsammlung with support since 1968. The functions fulfilled by the Society are described in its bylaws, and encompass the conceptual and material furtherance of the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen. Its chief priority is the acquisition of works of art. Thanks to the Friends of the Kunstsammlung, a number of the museum's otherwise unattainable goals in this area have been fulfilled.\nIn order to cope successfully with a set of challenges which has grown continuously as the museum has expanded to occupy three separate buildings (the K20, the K21 and the Schmela Haus), the Society must call upon a continuously expanding community of \"friends\" who are prepared to provide both conceptual and material support for this internationally recognized museum of modern and contemporary art.\n\n\n== Library ==\nThe K20 has at its disposal a publicly accessible specialist library containing literature on the art of the 20th and 21st centuries. The holdings encompass more than 100,000 volumes, which can be used on location. Among these are monographs, reference works, exhibition catalogs, periodicals, bulletins, and audiovisual media such as videos and CDs. After the death of the museum's founding director, the library was renamed the Werner Schmalenbach Library in his honor.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of art museums\nList of museums in Germany\n\n\n== Literature ==\nKunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, D\u00fcsseldorf (ed.): Einblicke.

        "wiki": "D\u00fcsseldorf (often Dusseldorf in English sources; UK: , US: , German: [\u02c8d\u028fsl\u0329d\u0254\u0281f] (listen);  Low Franconian and Ripuarian: D\u00fcsseld\u00f6rp ([\u02c8d\u028fsl\u0329d\u0153\u0250\u032fp]); archaic Dutch: Dusseldorp) is the capital and second-largest city of the most populous German state of North Rhine-Westphalia after Cologne, and the seventh-largest city in Germany, with a population of 617,280. At the confluence of the Rhine and its tributary D\u00fcssel, the city lies in the centre of both the Rhine-Ruhr and the Rhineland Metropolitan Regions with the Cologne Bonn Region to its south and the Ruhr to its north. Most of the city lies on the right bank of the Rhine (as opposed to Cologne, whose city centre lies on the river's left bank). The city is the largest in the German Low Franconian dialect area (closely related to Dutch). \"Dorf\" meaning \"village\" in German, the \"-dorf\" suffix (English cognate: thorp) is unusual in the German-speaking area for a settlement of D\u00fcsseldorf's size.\nMercer's 2012 Quality of Living survey ranked D\u00fcsseldorf the sixth most livable city in the world. D\u00fcsseldorf Airport is Germany's third-busiest airport after those of Frankfurt and Munich, serving as the most important international airport for the inhabitants of the densely populated Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area. D\u00fcsseldorf is an international business and financial centre, renowned for its fashion and trade fairs, and is headquarters to one Fortune Global 500 and two DAX companies. Messe D\u00fcsseldorf organises nearly one fifth of premier trade shows. As second largest city of the Rhineland, D\u00fcsseldorf holds Rhenish Carnival celebrations every year in February/March, the D\u00fcsseldorf carnival celebrations being the third most popular in Germany after those held in Cologne and Mainz.There are 22 institutions of higher education in the city including the Heinrich-Heine-Universit\u00e4t D\u00fcsseldorf, the university of applied sciences (Hochschule D\u00fcsseldorf), the academy of arts (Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf) (Joseph Beuys, Emanuel Leutze, August Macke, Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, and Andreas Gursky), and the university of music (Robert-Schumann-Musikhochschule D\u00fcsseldorf). The city is also known for its pioneering influence on electronic/experimental music (Kraftwerk) and its Japanese community.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early development ===\nWhen the Roman Empire was strengthening its position throughout Europe, a few Germanic tribes clung on in marshy territory off the eastern banks of the Rhine. In the 7th and 8th centuries, the odd farming or fishing settlement could be found at the point where the small river D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine. It was from such settlements that the city of D\u00fcsseldorf grew.\n\nThe first written mention of D\u00fcsseldorf (then called Dusseldorp in the local Low Rhenish dialect) dates back to 1135. Under Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa the small town of Kaiserswerth to the north of D\u00fcsseldorf became a well-fortified outpost, where soldiers kept a watchful eye on every movement on the Rhine. Kaiserswerth eventually became a suburb of D\u00fcsseldorf in 1929. In 1186, D\u00fcsseldorf came under the rule of the Counts of Berg. 14 August 1288 is one of the most important dates in the history of D\u00fcsseldorf. On this day the sovereign Count Adolf VIII of Berg granted the village on the banks of the D\u00fcssel town privileges. Before this, a bloody struggle for power had taken place between the Archbishop of Cologne and the count of Berg, culminating in the Battle of Worringen.\n\nThe Archbishop of Cologne's forces were wiped out by the forces of the count of Berg who were supported by citizens and farmers of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf, paving the way for D\u00fcsseldorf's elevation to city status, which is commemorated today by a monument on the Burgplatz. The custom of turning cartwheels is credited to the children of D\u00fcsseldorf. There are variations of the origin of the cartwheeling children. Today the symbol (Der Radschl\u00e4ger) represents the story and every year the D\u00fcsseldorfers celebrate by having a cartwheeling contest. After this battle the relationship between the four cities deteriorated, because they were commercial rivals; it is often said that there is a kind of hostility between the citizens of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf. Today, it finds its expression mainly in a humorous form (especially during the Rhineland Karneval) and in sports.A market square sprang up on the banks of the Rhine and the square was protected by city walls on all four sides. In 1380, the dukes of Berg moved their seat to the town and D\u00fcsseldorf was made regional capital of the Duchy of Berg. During the following centuries several famous landmarks were built, including the Collegiate Church of St Lambertus. In 1609, the ducal line of the United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg died out, and after a virulent struggle over succession, J\u00fclich and Berg fell to the Wittelsbach Counts of Palatinate-Neuburg, who made D\u00fcsseldorf their main domicile, even after they inherited the Electorate of the Palatinate, in 1685, becoming now Prince-electors as Electors Palatine.Under the art-loving Johann Wilhelm II (r. 1690\u20131716), a vast art gallery with a huge selection of paintings and sculptures, were housed in the Stadtschloss (city castle). After his death, the city fell on hard times again, especially after Elector Charles Theodore inherited Bavaria and moved the electoral court to Munich. With him he took the art collection, which became part of what is now the Alte Pinakothek in Munich. Destruction and poverty struck D\u00fcsseldorf after the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon made Berg a Grand Duchy and D\u00fcsseldorf its capital. Johann Devaranne, a leader of Solingen's resistance to Napoleon's conscription decrees, was executed here in 1813. After Napoleon's defeat, the whole Rhineland including Berg was given to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815. The Rhine Province's parliament was established in D\u00fcsseldorf. By the mid-19th century, D\u00fcsseldorf enjoyed a revival thanks to the Industrial Revolution as the city boasted 100,000 inhabitants by 1882; the figure doubled in 1892.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nDuring World War I the Royal Naval Air Service (RNS) undertook the first Entente strategic bombing missions on 22 September 1914, when it bombed the Zeppelin bases in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\nIn 1920, D\u00fcsseldorf became the centre of the General Strike. On 15 April 1920, 45 delegates of the German Miners Union were murdered by the Freikorps.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nThe city was a target of strategic bombing during World War II, particularly during the RAF bombing campaign in 1943 when over 700 bombers were used in a single night. Raids continued late into the war. As part of the campaign against German oil facilities, the RAF raid of 20\u201321 February on the Rhenania Ossag refinery in the Reisholz district of the city halted oil production there. The Allied ground advance into Germany reached D\u00fcsseldorf in mid-April 1945. The United States 97th Infantry Division easily captured the city on 18 April 1945, after the local German Resistance group launched Aktion Rheinland.\n\n\n=== German Federal Republic ===\nIn 1946, D\u00fcsseldorf was made capital of the new federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The city's reconstruction proceeded at a frantic pace and the economic transformation guided D\u00fcsseldorf's economic growth.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Physical geography ===\n\nD\u00fcsseldorf lies at the centre of the Lower Rhine basin, where the delta of the D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine. The city lies on the east side of the Rhine, except District 4 (Oberkassel, Niederkassel, Heerdt and L\u00f6rick).\nAcross the Rhine, the city of Neuss stands on the delta of the Erft. D\u00fcsseldorf lies southwest of the Ruhr urban area, and in the middle of the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region.\nD\u00fcsseldorf is built entirely on alluvium, mud, sand, clay and occasionally gravel. The highest point in D\u00fcsseldorf is the top of Sandberg in the far eastern part of the city (Hubbelrath borough) at 165 metres (541 ft). The lowest point is at the far northern end in Wittlaer borough where the Schwarzbach enters the Rhine, with an average elevation of 28 metres (92 ft).\n\n\n=== Adjacent cities and districts ===\nThe following districts and cities border D\u00fcsseldorf (clockwise starting from the north): the City of Duisburg, the District of Mettmann (Ratingen, Mettmann, Erkrath, Hilden, Langenfeld, and Monheim), and the District of Neuss (Dormagen, Neuss, and Meerbusch).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe city has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb, mild in relation to East Germany). Like the rest of the lower Rhineland, D\u00fcsseldorf experiences moderate winters with little snowfall and mild to warm summers. The average annual temperature is 10.6 \u00b0C (51 \u00b0F) with an average yearly precipitation of 797 millimetres (31 in). The dominant wind direction is from the west with velocities in the range of 3 to 4 m/s (7\u20139 mph), with gusts of 3.5 \u22124.8 m/s (8\u201310.7 mph). The wind is calm (defined as being under 2 m/s or 4.5 mph) about 35% of the time, more frequently at night and in the winter.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nWith a population of 612,178 within the city boundaries (31 December 2015), D\u00fcsseldorf is Germany's seventh largest city. Its population surpassed the threshold of 100,000 inhabitants during the height of industrialisation in 1882, and peaked at just over 705,000 in 1962. The city then began to lose residents with many moving into neighbouring municipalities. However, since the late 1990s, the city's population has been slowly rising again.\nA total of 109,883 (18%) of D\u00fcsseldorf's population are foreigners (31 December 2008), the majority of whom come from within Europe (81,742). The largest national minorities are Turks, Greeks, and Poles.

Heinrich Heine, whose 200th birthday was celebrated in 1997 and who originally had a proposed memorial in the city dedicated to him; Clara and Robert Schumann; and as Felix Mendelssohn, are the most prominent artists related to the city, which is home to a distinguished Academy of Fine Arts.\nThe D\u00fcsseldorf cultural scene comprises traditional and avant-garde, classical and glamorous. The world-famous state art collection of North Rhine-Westphalia, the highly acclaimed Deutsche Oper am Rhein (opera), and the D\u00fcsseldorfer Schauspielhaus (theatre), artistic home of Gustaf Gr\u00fcndgens, are major elements of D\u00fcsseldorf's reputation as a centre of the fine arts.\n\n\n=== Beer ===\nD\u00fcsseldorf is well known for its Altbier, a hoppy beer which translates as old [style] beer, a reference to the pre-lager brewing method of using a warm top-fermenting yeast like British pale ales. Over time the Alt yeast adjusted to lower temperatures, and the Alt brewers would store or lager the beer after fermentation, leading to a cleaner, crisper beer. The name \"altbier\" first appeared in the 19th century to differentiate the beers of D\u00fcsseldorf from the new pale lager that was gaining a hold on Germany.Brewers in D\u00fcsseldorf used the pale malts that were used for the modern pale lagers, but retained the old (\"alt\") method of using warm fermenting yeasts. The first brewery to use the name Alt was Schumacher which opened in 1838. The founder, Mathias Schumacher, allowed the beer to mature in cool conditions in wooden casks for longer than normal, and laid the foundation for the modern alt \u2013 amber coloured and lagered. The result is a pale beer that has some of the lean dryness of a lager but with fruity notes as well.There are five pub-breweries in D\u00fcsseldorf which brew Altbier on the premises: F\u00fcchschen, Schumacher, Schl\u00fcssel, Uerige and Brauerei K\u00fcrzer. Four of the five are in the historic centre of D\u00fcsseldorf (Altstadt); the other (Schumacher), between the Altstadt and D\u00fcsseldorf Central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), also maintains an establishment in the Altstadt, Im Goldenen Kessel, across the street from Schl\u00fcssel.\nEach (except Brauerei K\u00fcrzer) produces a special, secret, seasonal \"Sticke\" version in small quantities, though the names vary: Schl\u00fcssel spells it \"Stike\", without the \"c\", while Schumacher calls its special beer \"Latzenbier\", meaning \"slat beer\", possibly because the kegs from which it was poured had been stored on raised shelves. F\u00fcchschen's seasonal is its Weihnachtsbier (Christmas beer), available in bottles starting mid-November, and served in the brewpub on Christmas Eve.\n\n\n=== Music and nightlife ===\n\nSince the 1950s the \"Kom(m)\u00f6dchen\" has been one of the most prominent political cabarets of Germany. The city's most famous contribution to the culture of modern popular music is beyond doubt the influential avant-garde electronic band Kraftwerk. Formed by a few D\u00fcsseldorf-born musicians, Kraftwerk is internationally known as the most significant band in the history of post-war German music and as pioneers in electronic music. Other influential musical groups originating from D\u00fcsseldorf include Neu!, formed in 1971 by Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother, after their split from Kraftwerk, and La D\u00fcsseldorf, also formed by Dinger in 1976 shortly after Neu! disbanded. Both groups had a significant influence on a variety of subsequent rock, post-punk, and electronic music artists.Internationally known power metal band Warlock was formed in D\u00fcsseldorf in 1982. Its frontwoman, Doro Pesch, had a successful solo career in Europe and Asia since Warlock ended. The punk band Die Toten Hosen, which is famous around the world, also the most popular singers in Germany Westernhagen and Heino come from D\u00fcsseldorf. The electronic act D.A.F. was formed in the city in 1978, as well as the electronic/industrial pioneers Die Krupps in 1980. Another famous formation is Fehlfarben. Founded in the late 1970s by Peter Hein, Frank Fenstermacher, Kurt Dahlke and Michael Kemner.\nD\u00fcsseldorf appears in several songs, including D\u00fcsseldorf by the British indie band Teleman and W\u00e4rst du doch in D\u00fcsseldorf geblieben by Danish singer Dorthe Kollo.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nD\u00fcsseldorf, Germany is the fashion capital of Germany as it is a major cultural center for the art and fashion scenes. The fashionable clothes trend took root in this city before 1949. 1949 is the date of the first fashion show staged in D\u00fcsseldorf. Fashion trends have occurred as access to more elegant clothing for the general public has been a part of the culture for almost a century. Two times a year an event called the, \u201cVoices of Fashion,\u201d occurs and attracts many people to visit D\u00fcsseldorf to find the latest fashion items. There are famous designers that have made a name for themselves in D\u00fcsseldorf as well. Designers Sabine Schumacher, Peter O. Mahler, and Renate Harvan all design in D\u00fcsseldorf. To keep the creativity and passion for fashion alive in D\u00fcsseldorf everyday there are schools dedicated to fashion design in D\u00fcsseldorf as well. Akademie Mode and Design Institution, Design Department Academy, and Mode Design College are the three prominent fashion schools residing in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n=== Carnival ===\n\nOne of the biggest cultural events in D\u00fcsseldorf is the Karneval (also referred to as the \"fifth season\") which starts every year on 11 November at 11:11 a.m., and reaches its climax on Rosenmontag (Rose Monday), featuring a huge parade through the streets of D\u00fcsseldorf. Karneval ends on Aschermittwoch (Ash Wednesday).\n\n\n=== Cartwheeler of D\u00fcsseldorf ===\n\nThe D\u00fcsseldorfer Radschl\u00e4ger (Boy who does Cartwheels) is said to be the city's oldest tradition. The symbol of the cartwheeler can be found on many souvenirs and various things in D\u00fcsseldorf have the cartwheelers to thank for their names. This tradition was honoured in 1954 by the erection of a fountain, called Cartwheeler's Fountain, on the Burgplatz in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n==== Legends of its origin and history ====\nThe tradition cannot be linked to one specific historical event, instead, there are several stories surrounding the beginnings of the D\u00fcsseldorf Cartwheelers. Probably the most well known version is Battle of Worringen. In the battle of 1288 Count Adolf devastatingly defeated the Archbishop of Cologne. As a consequence of this victory, D\u00fcsseldorf obtained Town privileges. The inhabitants, especially the children ran joyfully on the streets and performed cartwheels.\nAnother story talks about a wedding procession during which one of the wheels of the wedding carriage broke. In order to fend off the threat of bad luck, a boy supposedly jumped to the carriage, took hold of the wheel and thus became a living part of the wheel. Whether the story is about the marriage of Jan Wellem and Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici or the wedding of Margravine Jakobea of Baden and Johann Wilhelm is debatable.\nAnother story gives an account of this wedding between Margrave Jacobe von Baden and Johann Wilhelm, in 1585. According to legend she felt miserable about her marriage, but the cartwheelers who displayed their skills next to her carriage were able to make her smile. Numerous travelers were attracted to the city by great exhibitions \u2013 the forerunner of today's fairs \u2013 between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. During this time the children who did the cart wheeling found out that it was a profitable source of income. The bourgeoisie accepted this in good humour as a symbolic act of local patriotism. In the beginning the lads shouted \"f\u00f6r eene Penning schlage ich das Rad\u201c (cartwheel for a penny). The Jan Wellem monument returned to D\u00fcsseldorf at the end of the Second World War. The procession was accompanied by torches, fanfares and the cartwheeling boys.\n\n\n===== Cartwheelers in the cityscape =====\nCartwheelers can be found by several fountains within the city and near many small landmarks. The most famous is Cartwheeler's Fountain in Burgplatz with an inscription of a quote by Hans M\u00fcller-Schl\u00f6sser: \"Radschl\u00e4ger wolle mer blieve, wie jeck et de Minschen och drieve\u201c (We will always remain cartwheelers, however crazy it drives people.) The fountain was designed by Alfred Zschorsch in 1954 and donated by the  Heimatverein D\u00fcsseldorfer Jonges, which is a club devoted to the maintenance of local and regional traditions. There are other cartwheelers that decorate storm drains and the door knocker on the Church of Lambertus, which was designed by Friedrich Becker. He created the cartwheeler in front of the Schadow Arcades.This tradition has been kept alive by the Alde D\u00fcsseldorfer B\u00fcrgergesellschaft von 1920 e. V., a society founded in 1920, who organized the first cartwheeler competition on 17 October 1937. Since 1971 this event has been held annually in cooperation with the Stadtsparkasse (a local bank), but formerly took place in the K\u00f6nigsallee. Since 2006 it has taken place on the Rheinwerft, near the old part of town. This is a fixed date in the city\u2019s calendar of events. About 500 boys regularly participate in this event and since 1971 girls have also taken part. In 2001 the art project Radschl\u00e4ger-Kunst (Cartwheeler Art) was called into life, in which over 100 cartwheeler sculptures have been designed by various artists. The door knocker on the Church of Lambertus functioned as a model for the sculptures that are 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) high, 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) wide and 30 cm (12 in) deep. They were positioned around the city centre. Some of the sculptures have been auctioned off to companies and private owners.\n\n\n=== Christmas market ===\nEvery Christmas, the city of D\u00fcsseldorf uses the city centre to host one of the largest Christmas gatherings in Germany. The Christmas festival occurs every year from 17 November until 23 December. This Christmas fest brings D\u00fcsseldorf a large portion of tourism every year as many people from nearby areas come to the city to drink mulled wine and hot chocolate and watch craftsman blow glass and create art. The event contains many small wooden buildings all clustered in the middle of the city for all the citizens to enjoy. The event, to many visitors, has an old European feel, but is very lively.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nTraditional meals in the region are Rheinischer Sauerbraten (a beef roast and sometimes horse marinated for a few days in vinegar and spices served with gravy and raisins) and Heaven and Earth (Himmel und \u00c4d; black pudding with stewed apples mixed with mashed potatoes). In winter the people like to eat Muscheln Rheinischer Art (Rhenish-style mussels) as well as Reibekuchen (fried potato pancake served with apple sauce). Also a special meal: D\u00fcsseldorfer Senfrostbraten (Steaks roasted with D\u00fcsseldorf mustard on top).\nD\u00fcsseldorf is known for its strong Dijon-like mustard served in a traditional pot called \"Mostertp\u00f6ttche\", which was eternalised in a still life by Vincent van Gogh in 1884.The Rhine Metropolis is one of the most diverse areas in terms of culinary diversity. D\u00fcsseldorf, with the third largest Japanese community in Europe, not only provides a wide range of culinary cuisine but also has a solid foundation of Authentic Asian food in the city. D\u00fcsseldorf's exceptional culinary cuisine has been recognized and visited by the Worldwide leading travel guide of Lonely Planet. Along with a broad range of diverse cultural cuisine, D\u00fcsseldorf is also home to various Michelin starred restaurants that are world renowned.Halve Hahn \u2013 this dish is made from a half a double rye roll, which is another of the specialties of D\u00fcsseldorf, buttered, with a thick slice of aged Gouda cheese, onions, mustard, ground paprika and sour pickles.\nHimmel un Aad \u2013 a dish of mashed potatoes and apples along with slices of blutwurst. Caramelized onions are usually served with this meal.\nReibekuchen is another famous dish from D\u00fcsseldorf; this dish is usually drizzled with R\u00fcbensyrup (beet syrup) and is served on pumpernickel slices along with applesauce\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nThe F\u00f6rderpreis f\u00fcr Literatur der Landeshauptstadt D\u00fcsseldorf is a German Literary award donated by the City of D\u00fcsseldorf in Northrhine-Westphalia.

The rivalry includes carnival parades, football, ice hockey and beer. People in Cologne prefer K\u00f6lsch while people in D\u00fcsseldorf prefer Alt. Waiters and patrons will \"scorn\" and make a \"mockery\" of people who order Alt beer in Cologne and K\u00f6lsch in D\u00fcsseldorf.

        "wiki": "The Hudson River School was a mid-19th century American art movement embodied by a group of landscape painters whose aesthetic vision was influenced by Romanticism. The paintings typically depict the Hudson River Valley and the surrounding area, including the Catskill, Adirondack, and White Mountains. Works by the second generation of artists associated with the school expanded to include other locales in New England, the Maritimes, the American West, and South America.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe name Hudson River School is thought to have been coined by New York Tribune art critic Clarence Cook or by landscape painter Homer Dodge Martin. It was initially used disparagingly, as the style had gone out of favor after the plein-air Barbizon School had come into vogue among American patrons and collectors.\nHudson River School paintings reflect three themes of America in the 19th century: discovery, exploration, and settlement. They also depict the American landscape as a pastoral setting, where human beings and nature coexist peacefully. Hudson River School landscapes are characterized by their realistic, detailed, and sometimes idealized portrayal of nature, often juxtaposing peaceful agriculture and the remaining wilderness which was fast disappearing from the Hudson Valley just as it was coming to be appreciated for its qualities of ruggedness and sublimity. In general, Hudson River School artists believed that nature in the form of the American landscape was a reflection of God, though they varied in the depth of their religious conviction. They were inspired by European masters such as Claude Lorrain, John Constable, and J. M. W. Turner. Several painters were members of the D\u00fcsseldorf school of painting, others were educated by German Paul Weber.\n\n\n== Founder ==\n\nThomas Cole is generally acknowledged as the founder of the Hudson River School. He took a steamship up the Hudson in the autumn of 1825, stopping first at West Point then at Catskill landing. He hiked west high into the eastern Catskill Mountains of New York to paint the first landscapes of the area. The first review of his work appeared in the New York Evening Post on November 22, 1825. Cole was from England and the brilliant autumn colors in the American landscape inspired him. His close friend Asher Durand became a prominent figure in the school, as well. A prominent element of the Hudson River School was its themes of nationalism, nature, and property. Adherents of the movement also tended to be suspicious of the economic and technological development of the age.\n\n\n== Second generation ==\n\nThe second generation of Hudson River School artists emerged after Cole's premature death in 1848; its members included Cole's prize pupil Frederic Edwin Church, John Frederick Kensett, and Sanford Robinson Gifford. Works by artists of this second generation are often described as examples of Luminism. Kensett, Gifford, and Church were also among the founders of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.Most of the finest works of the second generation were painted between 1855 and 1875. During that time, artists such as Frederic Edwin Church and Albert Bierstadt were celebrities. They were both influenced by the D\u00fcsseldorf school of painting, and Bierstadt had studied in that city for several years. Thousands of people would pay 25 cents per person to view paintings such as Niagara  and The Icebergs. The epic size of these landscapes was unexampled in earlier American painting and reminded Americans of the vast, untamed, and magnificent wilderness areas in their country. This was the period of settlement in the American West, preservation of national parks, and establishment of green city parks.\n\n\n== Women ==\nA number of women were associated with the Hudson River School. Susie M. Barstow was an avid mountain climber who painted the mountain scenery of the Catskills and the White Mountains. Eliza Pratt Greatorex was an Irish-born painter who was the second woman elected to the National Academy of Design. Julie Hart Beers led sketching expeditions in the Hudson Valley region before moving to a New York City art studio with her daughters. Harriet Cany Peale studied with Rembrandt Peale, and Mary Blood Mellen was a student and collaborator with Fitz Henry Lane.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nHudson River School art has had minor periods of resurgence in popularity. The school gained interest after World War I, probably due to nationalist attitudes. Interest declined until the 1960s, and the regrowth of the Hudson Valley has spurred further interest in the movement. Historic house museums and other sites dedicated to the Hudson River School include Olana State Historic Site in Hudson, New York, the Thomas Cole National Historic Site in the town of Catskill, the Newington-Cropsey Foundation's historic house museum, art gallery, and research library in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, and the John D. Barrow Art Gallery in the village of Skaneateles, New York.\n\n\n== Collections ==\n\n\n=== Public collections ===\nOne of the largest collections of paintings by artists of the Hudson River School is at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Connecticut. Some of the most notable works in the Atheneum's collection are 13 landscapes by Thomas Cole, and 11 by Hartford native Frederic Edwin Church, both of whom were personal friends of the museum's founder, Daniel Wadsworth.\n\n\n=== Other collections ===\nAlbany Institute of History & Art in Albany, New York\nArnot Art Museum in Elmira, New York\nBerkshire Museum in Pittsfield, Massachusetts\nBrooklyn Museum in Brooklyn, New York\nCorcoran Gallery of Art, in Washington, DC\nCrystal Bridges Museum, in Bentonville, Arkansas\nCummer Museum of Art & Gardens, in Jacksonville, Florida\nDetroit Institute of Arts in Detroit, Michigan\nFenimore Art Museum in Cooperstown, New York\nFrances Lehman Loeb Art Center, in Poughkeepsie, New York\nFruitlands Museum in Harvard, Massachusetts\nGilcrease Museum in Tulsa, Oklahoma\nHaggin Museum in Stockton, California\nHudson River Museum in Yonkers, New York\nHunter Museum of American Art in Chattanooga, Tennessee\nLouvre Museum in Paris, France\nMabee-Gerrer Museum of Art in Shawnee, Oklahoma\nMarsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park in Woodstock, Vermont\nMetropolitan Museum of Art, in Manhattan, New York\nMuseum of Fine Arts, Boston, in Boston, Massachusetts\nMuseum of White Mountain Art at Jackson, in New Hampshire\nNational Gallery of Art in Washington, DC\nNewark Museum in Newark, New Jersey\nNewington-Cropsey Foundation in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York\nNew-York Historical Society, in Manhattan, New York\nOlana State Historic Site, in Hudson, New York\nSt. Johnsbury Athenaeum, in St. Johnsbury, Vermont\nWestervelt Warner Museum of American Art, in Tuscaloosa, Alabama\nThyssen-Bornemisza Museum, in Madrid, Spain.\nThe Heckscher Museum of Art, in Huntington, New York\nWorcester Art Museum, in Worcester, Massachusetts\nWadsworth Atheneum, in Hartford, ConnecticutThe Newington-Cropsey Foundation, in their Gallery of Art Building, maintains a research library of Hudson River School art and painters, open to the public by reservation.\n\n\n== Notable artists ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nD\u00fcsseldorf school of painting\nHistory of painting\nLandscape art\nList of Hudson River School artists\nMacchiaioli\nRomanticism\nWestern painting\nWhite Mountain art\nYoung America Movement\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\nSources\n\nAmerican paradise: the world of the Hudson River school.

        "wiki": "The Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen is the art collection of the German Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia, in D\u00fcsseldorf. United by this institution are three different exhibition venues: the K20 at Grabbeplatz, the K21 in the St\u00e4ndehaus, and the Schmela Haus. The Kunstsammlung was founded in 1961 by the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia as a foundation under private law for the purpose of displaying the art collection and expanding it through new acquisitions.\nDuring its 50-year history, the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen has earned an international reputation as a museum for the art of the 20th century. For some time now, however, the chronological spectrum of the collection\u2014which was initiated through the purchase of works by Paul Klee\u2014has extended up to the immediate present. The building at Grabbeplatz (K20), with its characteristic black granite fa\u00e7ade, was inaugurated in 1986. An extension building was completed in 2010.\nWith major works by Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and Piet Mondrian, among others, as well as a wide-ranging ensemble of circa 100 drawings and paintings by Paul Klee, the permanent collection of the Kunstsammlung offers a singular perspective of classical modernism. The collection of postwar American art includes works by Jackson Pollock and Frank Stella and by pop artists Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, and Andy Warhol; other high points of the collection are works by Joseph Beuys, Gerhard Richter, Tony Cragg, Emil Schumacher, Sarah Morris, Katharina Fritsch, Nam June Paik, Wolf Vostell and Imi Knoebel.\nOpened in spring of 2002 as an additional venue of the Kunstsammlung was the St\u00e4ndehaus (K21) set alongside the Kaiserteich, a building which formerly served as the seat of the Parliament of North Rhine-Westphalia. Among the highlights on view there are a number of artist's rooms and large-scale installations, a special focus of this portion of the collection.\nThe Schmela Haus, in D\u00fcsseldorf's historic district, joined the Kunstsammlung in 2009 as a \"rehearsal stage\" and lecture venue. When it first opened in 1971, this protected landmark by Dutch architect Aldo van Eyck was home to the Galerie Alfred Schmela and was the first building to be erected in the Federal Republic of Germany expressly as an art gallery. Since spring of 2011, the Schmela Haus is also used again for exhibitions.\nAs an institution with three locations, the Kunstsammlung has more than 10,000 m2 (110,000 sq ft) of exhibition surface at its disposal.\nWith its accompanying programs and special projects, the Education Department strives to make the works held in the Regional Collection accessible to visitors of all ages. Available for this purpose are a number of studios, a media workshop, and a \"laboratory\" which is integrated into the exhibition galleries.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe history of the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen begins in 1960 with the purchase of 88 works by Paul Klee from the collection of Pittsburgh steel manufacturer G. David Thompson. The purchase\u2014brokered by Basel art dealer Ernst Beyeler and overseen by then state premiere Franz Meyer\u2014forms the nucleus of the collection, founded in 1961 under the title \"Stiftung Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen\". Between 1962 and his retirement in 1990, Werner Schmalenbach served as the first director of the newly founded collection. He assembled an extraordinarily high-quality collection of classical modernist artworks, thereby creating the only regional collection in Germany specializing in modern art. To begin with, the collection was housed in J\u00e4gerhof Palace. Soon after it opened, space limitations prompted plans for a new building. Announced in 1975 was a competition for its design; the winning proposal was submitted by the Danish architectural office of Dissing+Weitling. The building \u2013 which resides within architectural history at the transition from postwar modernism to postmodernism \u2013 was inaugurated on 14 March 1986 in the presence of the then German President Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker, and has served ever since as an emblem of the city. With its curved fa\u00e7ade of polished, natural black stone, the building gives Grabbeplatz its special character. It sits on the square directly across from the Kunsthalle D\u00fcsseldorf, whose building also serves as the headquarters of the Kunstverein f\u00fcr die Rheinlande und Westfalen.\nIn 1990, Schmalenbach was succeeded as Director by Armin Zweite, formerly head of the St\u00e4dtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus in Munich. While Schmalenbach had expanded the museum's holdings for the most part through the addition of masterworks of painting, it was primarily contemporary sculptures, installations, and photographs of international rank which entered the collection beginning in 1990 through the efforts of his successor. On 1 September 2009, Marion Ackermann \u2013 former director of the Kunstmuseum Stuttgart \u2013 assumed artistic directorship of the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen. She has taken a dynamic approach to the collection, and seeks to relate contemporary art and classic modern to one another more closely. Together with Hagen Lippe-Wei\u00dfenfeld, who joined the team on 1 November 2008 as Director of Finance and Business Affairs, Ackermann serves on the Chairmanship of the Foundation.\n\nOn 12 November 2009, the Kunstsammlung inaugurated the former home of the Galerie Schmela, located at Mutter-Ey-Stra\u00dfe 3 in D\u00fcsseldorf-Altstadt, as a venue for exhibitions, discussions and other activities.\nAfter remaining closed for more than two years during comprehensive renovations and the erection of an extension building, the K20 at Grabbeplatz resumed operations as an exhibition venue in July 2010. Available now for the collection and for temporary exhibitions is a generous surface area. The first artists to exhibit there were Belgian illustrator Kris Martin and German sculptor Michael Sailstorfer, who created accessible installations for the two galleries of the new building, namely the Klee Halle and the Konrad und Gabriele Henkel Galerie, which together offer almost 2.000 m\u00b2.\nDuring the first two weeks after the reopening alone, nearly 60,000 visitors took advantage of free admission to the Kunstsammlung. The museum welcomed its 100,000th visitor on 21 October 2010. Contributing to the new and more emphatic public presence of the Kunstsammlung \u2013 which is now able to display the art collections of this federal state more comprehensively than ever before \u2013 is the large-scale mosaic mural \"Hornet\", composed of colorful tiles and the work of American artist Sarah Morris. With its length of 27 meters, it has become attractive landmark on the newly created Paul Klee Platz along the rear fa\u00e7ade of the K20.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nFeatured on a regular basis in the venues of the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen alongside presentations of the permanent collection are internationally acclaimed temporary exhibitions.\nOn view from 11 September 2010 to 16 January 2011 in the K20 and the Schmela Haus was the ambitious Joseph Beuys exhibition \"Parallelprozesse/Parallel Processes\", organized around large-scale installation works dating from all creative periods of this artist. This exhibition \u2013 the first special presentation mounted after the reopening of the Kunstsammlung am Grabbeplatz \u2013 formed part of the program of the D\u00fcsseldorf Quadriennale, and was seen by 103,000 visitors.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== The K20 am Grabbeplatz ===\nThe building which houses the Kunstsammlung K20 am Grabbeplatz, with its distinctive fa\u00e7ade of black Bornholm granite, was opened in 1986. Working in the tradition of Arne Jacobsen, the Copenhagen architecture office of Dissing+Weitling created a building which features details typical of its time and positions the qualities of the artworks on display in the foreground.\nThe entrance area opens onto the Grabbe Halle on the same level, the building's tallest gallery space, which features 14-metre ceilings. Used for temporary exhibitions, this hall measures 600 m\u00b2 and is free of supporting pillars.\nFrom the lobby, three single-flight staircases arranged one behind the next provide access to the two upper storeys. Like the galleries in the 2nd upper storey, the large hall in the 1st upper storey enjoys natural top lighting.\nThe foundation stone for the extension was laid in 2008 and the new building was inaugurated in July 2010. Realized by the same architectural office, the new building perpetuates the architectural idiom of the original structure. During the two-year-long period of closure, the original building was completely renovated and brought up to current technical standards.\nAvailable now in the two new exhibition halls of the extension building \u2013 both free of supporting pillars \u2013 are altogether 2000 m\u00b2 of surface area. The Klee Halle is positioned on the right-hand side of the foyer of the old building, and is mainly used for temporary exhibitions. With a clearance space of 6.4 m, the hall is illuminated artificially by more than 500 spotlights. A narrow staircase in the rear connects the ground floor level with the new upper hall. The entire exhibition surface of the Kunstsammlung am Grabbeplatz now amounts to more than 5000 m\u00b2.\n\n\n=== The K21 in the St\u00e4ndehaus ===\nOn 18 April 2002, the museum building known as the St\u00e4ndehaus am Kaiserteich was inaugurated in the presence of German then President Johannes Rau, and became the second main pillar of the Kunstsammlung for modern and contemporary art.\nBetween 1876 and 1880, the St\u00e4ndehaus in D\u00fcsseldorf was erected in the historicist neo-Renaissance style by architect Julius Raschdorff. For many years, the St\u00e4ndehaus accommodated the Provincial Diet of the Prussian province of the Rhineland. The Parliament of the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia met there between 1949 and 1988. Following the relocation of the Parliament, the St\u00e4ndehaus remained empty and unused for 14 years.\nSurrounding the building's central public square \u2013 which takes the form of a spacious piazza \u2013 are four wings containing continuous arcade passageways. The three-year conversion of this representative building in the historicist style was undertaken by the architects Kiessler+Partner of Munich. They created a modern museum building with a striking glazed domed roof in the form of an elongated cloister vault, composed of 1919 sheets of glass, which shapes the building's aesthetic appearance.\nWhile the outer fa\u00e7ade has been preserved, nearly all original fixtures were removed from the interior. The historic staircase was retained, and now leads to the galleries in the three upper stories. The flexible exhibition galleries in the basement level, together with the upper rooms, add up to altogether 5300 m\u00b2 of exhibition surface.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== The Schmela Haus ===\nThe Schmela Haus was built by Dutch architect Aldo van Eyck (1918\u20131999), a key representative of structuralist architecture. Inaugurated in 1971, and now under landmarks protection, it was the first building in the Federal German Republic to be erected specifically as a private art gallery. The five-story building, built from gray pumice, is characterized by its interplay of interior and exterior and between its private residential and public exhibition spaces. The building was purchased by the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia after being vacated by the gallery.\n51\u00b013\u203238\u2033N 6\u00b046\u203232\u2033E\n\n\n== Collection ==\n\nThe collection encompasses a singular selection of works from the 20th and 21st centuries. Among the high points are paintings by the German Expressionists, Pablo Picasso, Wassily Kandinsky and Jackson Pollock, and installations by Joseph Beuys and Nam June Paik. Alongside these works, which have long since achieved iconic status, are additional outstanding examples of classical modernism, of American art after 1945, along with major installation works, photographs, and film and video pieces by contemporary artists. Critics have referred to the collection \u2013 whose individual works are notable for their outstanding quality \u2013 as a \"secret National Gallery\".The focus of the collection is classical modernism. Stylistically, the works from before 1945 range from Fauvism, Expressionism, Pittura Metafisica, and Cubism to works by members of the Blaue Reiter group, as well as Dada and Surrealism. The collection also includes 100 works by Paul Klee. In 1960, the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia earmarked 6 million German Marks for the purchase of 88 paintings, drawings, and color studies on paper by Klee \u2013 an ensemble which formed the nucleus of the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen. Although the price tag seemed high at the time, it appears a rare bargain from today's perspective. The works came from a private American collection in Pittsburgh.\nAmong groups of works by individual artists is an ensemble of 12 by Pablo Picasso which encompasses nearly all of the major creative phases of his career. Cubism forms an important focus of the collection, with works in the style by Pablo Picasso, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Juan Gris, Georges Braque and others.\nArt after 1945 is represented primarily by circa 40 major pieces by American artists. Among these are works by Mark Rothko, Robert Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol, Donald Judd and Jackson Pollock, whose monumental Number 32 from 1950 is one of the few mural-sized drip paintings by this artist, and is regarded as a key exemplar of Abstract Expressionism. Among the four works by Robert Rauschenberg is Wager, which dates from 1957 and is one of the largest and most complex of his \"combine paintings\".\nEuropean postwar art is represented among others by the works of Markus L\u00fcpertz, Per Kirkeby, Gerhard Richter, Emil Schumacher and Joseph Beuys, whose late work  \"Palazzo Regale\", acquired in 1992, has been supplemented by a further 60 works. These were formerly owned by D\u00fcsseldorf art collector G\u00fcnter Ulbricht.\nInstallations and artist's rooms are an important focus of the Kunstsammlung, an area which has been expanded continuously in recent years (through works by Marcel Broodthaers, for example). German photography is represented in the collection by the works of Bernd and Hilla Becher and other exponents of the D\u00fcsseldorf School of photographers. In the realm of new media, i.e. film and video, the collection continues to expand, and presently contains around 90 works.\nIn 2005, the private collection of Simone and Heinz Ackermans, which contained 150 works of international contemporary art, was acquired by the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia following the display of selected works from the collection at the K21 from 2002 to 2005. The focus of the Ackermans Collection is art since the 1980s, on figurative sculpture, photographic works, installations, as well as film and video works.\n\n\n== Patrons ==\n                                                                                                             \nThe Gesellschaft der Freunde der Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen e.V. (Society of Friends of the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen) has provided the Kunstsammlung with support since 1968. The functions fulfilled by the Society are described in its bylaws, and encompass the conceptual and material furtherance of the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen. Its chief priority is the acquisition of works of art. Thanks to the Friends of the Kunstsammlung, a number of the museum's otherwise unattainable goals in this area have been fulfilled.\nIn order to cope successfully with a set of challenges which has grown continuously as the museum has expanded to occupy three separate buildings (the K20, the K21 and the Schmela Haus), the Society must call upon a continuously expanding community of \"friends\" who are prepared to provide both conceptual and material support for this internationally recognized museum of modern and contemporary art.\n\n\n== Library ==\nThe K20 has at its disposal a publicly accessible specialist library containing literature on the art of the 20th and 21st centuries. The holdings encompass more than 100,000 volumes, which can be used on location. Among these are monographs, reference works, exhibition catalogs, periodicals, bulletins, and audiovisual media such as videos and CDs. After the death of the museum's founding director, the library was renamed the Werner Schmalenbach Library in his honor.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of art museums\nList of museums in Germany\n\n\n== Literature ==\nKunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, D\u00fcsseldorf (ed.): Einblicke.

        "wiki": "Bad Kreuznach (German pronunciation: [ba\u02d0t \u02c8k\u0281\u0254\u028ftsnax]) is a town in the Bad Kreuznach district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It is a spa town most well known for its medieval bridge dating from around 1300, the Alte Nahebr\u00fccke, which is one of the few remaining bridges in the world with buildings on it.The town is located in the Nahe river wine region, renowned both nationally and internationally for its wines, especially from the Riesling, Silvaner and M\u00fcller-Thurgau grape varieties.\nBad Kreuznach does not lie within any Verbandsgemeinde, even though it is the seat of the Bad Kreuznach (Verbandsgemeinde). The town is the seat of several courts as well as federal and state authorities. Bad Kreuznach is also officially a gro\u00dfe kreisangeh\u00f6rige Stadt (\"large town belonging to a district\"), meaning that it does not have the district-level powers that kreisfreie St\u00e4dte (\"district-free towns/cities\") enjoy. It is, nonetheless, the district seat, and also the seat of the state chamber of commerce for Rhineland-Palatinate. It is classed as a middle centre with some functions of an upper centre, making it the administrative, cultural and economic hub of a region with more than 150,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nBad Kreuznach lies between the Hunsr\u00fcck, Rhenish Hesse and the North Palatine Uplands some 14 km (as the crow flies) south-southwest of Bingen am Rhein. It lies at the mouth of the Ellerbach where it empties into the lower Nahe.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring municipalities ===\nClockwise from the north, Bad Kreuznach's neighbours are the municipalities of Bretzenheim, Langenlonsheim, Gensingen, Welgesheim, Zotzenheim, Sprendlingen, Badenheim (these last five lying in the neighbouring Mainz-Bingen district), Biebelsheim, Pfaffen-Schwabenheim, Volxheim, Hackenheim, Frei-Laubersheim, Altenbamberg, Traisen, H\u00fcffelsheim, R\u00fcdesheim an der Nahe, Roxheim, Hargesheim and Guldental.\n\n\n=== Constituent communities ===\nBad Kreuznach's outlying Ortsbezirke or Stadtteile are Bosenheim, Ippesheim, Planig, Winzenheim and Bad M\u00fcnster am Stein-Ebernburg.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nYearly precipitation in Bad Kreuznach amounts to 517 mm, which is very low, falling into the lowest third of the precipitation chart for all Germany. Only at 5% of the German Weather Service's weather stations are even lower figures recorded. The driest month is January. The most rainfall comes in June. In that month, precipitation is 1.8 times what it is in January. Precipitation varies only slightly. At only 7% of the weather stations are lower seasonal swings recorded.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nAs early as the 5th century BC, there is conclusive evidence that there was a Celtic settlement within what are now Bad Kreuznach's town limits. About 58 BC, the area became part of the Roman Empire and a Roman vicus came into being here, named, according to legend, after a Celt called Cruciniac, who transferred a part of his land to the Romans for them to build a supply station between Mainz (Mogontiacum) and Trier (Augusta Treverorum). Kreuznach lay on the Roman road that led from Metz (Divodurum) by way of the Saar crossing near Dillingen-Pachten (Contiomagus) and the Vicus Wareswald near Tholey to Bingen am Rhein (Bingium). About AD 250, an enormous (measuring 81 \u00d7 71 m), luxurious palace, unique to the lands north of the Alps, was built, in the style of a peristyle villa. It contained 50 rooms on the ground floor alone. Spolia found near the Heidenmauer (\"Heathen Wall\") have led to the conclusion that there were a temple to either Mercury or both Mercury and Maia and a Gallo-Roman provincial theatre. According to an inscription and tile plates that were found in Bad Kreuznach, a vexillatio of the Legio XXII Primigenia was stationed there. In the course of measures to shore up the Imperial border against the Germanic Alemannic tribes who kept making incursions across the limes into the Empire, an auxiliary castrum was built in 370 under Emperor Valentinian I.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nAfter Rome's downfall, Kreuznach became in the year 500 a royal estate and an imperial village in the newly growing Frankish Empire. Then, the town's first church was built within the old castrum's walls, which was at first consecrated to Saint Martin, but later to Saint Kilian, and in 1590, it was torn down. According to an 822 document from Louis the Pious, who was invoking an earlier document from Charlemagne, about 741, Saint Martin's Church in Kreuznach was supposedly donated to the Bishopric of W\u00fcrzburg by his forebear Carloman. According to this indirect note, Kreuznach once again had a documentary mention in the Annales regni Francorum as Royal Pfalz (an imperial palace), where Louis the Pious stayed in 819 and 839. Kreuznach was mentioned in documents by Louis the Pious (in 823 as villa Cruciniacus and in 825 and 839 as Cruciniacum castrum or Cruciniacum palatium regium), Louis the German (in 845 as villa Cruzinacha and in 868 as villa Cruciniacum), Charles III, \"the Fat\" (in 882 as C[h]rucinachum, Crutcinacha, Crucenachum), Arnulf of Carinthia (in 889), Henry the Fowler (in 923), Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor (in 962 as Cruciniacus) and Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor (in 1179 as Cruczennach). On the other hand, the Crucinaha in Emperor Otto III's documents from 1000 (which granted the rights to hold a yearly market and to strike coins) is today thought to refer to Christnach, an outlying centre of Waldbillig, a town nowadays in Luxembourg. In mediaeval and early modern Latin sources, Kreuznach is named not only as Crucenacum, Crucin[i]acum (adjective Crucenacensis, Crucin[i]acensis) and the like, but also as Stauronesus, Stauronesum (adjective Staurone[n]s[i]us; from \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 \"cross\" and \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 \"island\") or Naviculacrucis (from navicula, a kind of small boat used on inland waterways, called a Nachen in German, and crux \"cross\"). Sometimes also encountered is the abbreviation Xnach (often with a Fraktur X, with a cross-stroke: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            X\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {X}}}\n  ). About 1017, Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor enfeoffed his wife Cunigunde's grandnephew Count Eberhard V of Nellenburg with the noble estate of Kreuznach and the Villa Schwabenheim belonging thereto. After his death, King Henry IV supposedly donated the settlement of Kreuznach to the High Foundation of Speyer in 1065, who then transferred it shortly after 1105 \u2013 presumably as a fief \u2013 to the Counts of Sponheim. On Epiphany 1147, it is said that Bernard of Clairvaux performed a miraculous healing at Saint Kilian's Church. In 1183, half of the old Frankish village of Kreuznach at the former Roman castrum \u2013 the Osterburg \u2013 burnt down. Afterwards, of the 21 families there, 11 moved to what is now the Old Town (Altstadt). In the years 1206 to 1230, Counts Gottfried III of Sponheim (d. 1218) and Johann I of Sponheim (d. 1266) had the castle Kauzenburg built, even though King Philip of Swabia had forbidden them to do so. Along with the building of this castle came the rise of the New Town (Neustadt) on the Nahe's north bank. In the years 1235 and 1270, Kreuznach was granted town rights, market rights, taxation rights and tolling rights under the rule of the comital House of Sponheim, which were acknowledged once again in 1290 by King Rudolf I of Habsburg (1218\u20131291). In 1279, in the Battle of Sprendlingen, the legend of Michel Mort arose. He is a local legendary hero, a butcher from Kreuznach who fought on the Sponheim side in the battle against the troops of the Archbishop of Mainz. When Count Johann I of Sponheim found himself in difficulties, Michel Mort drew the enemy's lances upon himself, sparing the Count by bringing about his own death. Early knowledge of the town of Kreuznach is documented in one line of a song by the minstrel Tannh\u00e4user from the 13th century, which is preserved in handwriting by Hans Sachs: \"vur cre\u0171czenach rint a\u0171ch die na\". In Modern German, this would be \"Vor Kreuznach rinnt auch die Nahe\" (\"Before Kreuznach, the Nahe also runs\"). Records witness Jewish settlement in Kreuznach beginning in the late 13th century, while for a short time in the early 14th century, North Italian traders (\"Lombards\") lived in town. In the 13th century, Kreuznach was a fortified town and in 1320 it withstood a siege by Archbishop-Elector Baldwin of Trier (about 1270\u20131336). In 1361, Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor (1316\u20131378) granted Count Walram I of Sponheim (about 1305\u20131380) a yearly market privilege for Kreuznach. In 1375, the townsfolk rose up against the town council. Count Walram's response was to have four of the uprising's leaders beheaded at the marketplace. Through its long time as Kreuznach's lordly family, the House of Sponheim had seven heads:\n\nSimon I (1223\u20131264)\nJohn I (1265\u20131290)\nJohn II (1290\u20131340) and Simon II (1290\u20131336)\nWalram (1336\u20131380)\nSimon III (1380\u20131414)\nElisabeth (1414\u20131417)In 1417, however, the \"Further\" line of the House of Sponheim died out when Countess Elisabeth of Sponheim-Kreuznach (1365\u20131417) died. In her will, she divided the county between Electoral Palatinate and the County of Sponheim-Starkenburg, bequeathing to them one fifth and four-fifths respectively. In 1418, King Sigismund of Luxembourg (1368\u20131437) enfeoffed Count Johann V of Sponheim-Starkenburg (about 1359\u20131437) with the yearly market, the mint, the Jews at Kreuznach and the right of escort as far as Gensingen on the Trier-Mainz highway. In 1437, the lordship over Kreuznach was divided up between the Counts of Veldenz, the Margraves of Baden and Palatinate-Simmern. In 1457, at a time when a children's crusade movement was on the rise, 120 children left Kreuznach on their way to Mont-Saint-Michel by way of Wissembourg. In 1475, Electoral Palatinate issued a comprehensive police act for the Amt of Kreuznach, in which at this time, no Badish Amtmann resided. Elector Palatine Philip the Upright (1448\u20131508) and John I, Count Palatine of Simmern (1459\u20131509), granted the town leave to hold a second yearly market in 1490. In that same year, Elector Palatine Philip bestowed ownership of the saltz- und badbronnen (\"salty and bathing springs\") upon his cooks Conrad Brunn and Matthes von Nevendorf. The briny springs were likely discovered in 1478; nevertheless a Sulzer Hof in what is today called the Salinental (\"Saltworks Dale\") had already been mentioned in the 13th or 14th century. On 24 August 1495, there was another uprising of the townsfolk, but this one was directed at Kreuznach's Palatine Amtmann, Albrecht V G\u00f6ler von Ravensburg (1444\u20131503), who had refused to release a prisoner against the posting of a bond. Nobody was beheaded this time, but Elector Palatine Philip did have a few of the leaders maimed, and then put into force a new town order.\n\n\n==== Town fortifications ====\nThe town wall, first mentioned in 1247, had a footprint that formed roughly a square in the Old Town, and was set back a few metres from what are today the streets Wilhelmstra\u00dfe, Salinenstra\u00dfe and Schlo\u00dfstra\u00dfe, with the fourth side skirting the millpond. Serving as town gates were, in the north, the Kilianstor or the M\u00fchlentor (\"Saint Kilian's Gate\" or \"Mill Gate\"; torn down in 1877), in the southeast the Hackenheimer Tor (later the Mannheimer Tor; torn down in 1860) and in the south the St.-Peter-Pf\u00f6rtchen, which lay at the end of Rossstra\u00dfe, and which for security was often walled up. In the New Town, the town wall ran from the Butterfass (\"Butterchurn\"; later serving as the prison tower) on the Nahe riverbank up to the intersection of Wilhelmstra\u00dfe and Br\u00fcckes on Bundesstra\u00dfe 48, where to the northwest the L\u00f6hrpforte (also called the Lehrtor or the Binger Tor; torn down about 1837) was found. It then ran in a bow between Hofgartenstra\u00dfe and Hochstra\u00dfe to the R\u00fcdesheimer Tor in the southwest at the beginning of Gerbergasse, whose course it then followed down to the Ellerbach and along the Nahe as a riverbank wall. Along this section, the town wall contained the Fischerpforte or Ellerpforte as a watergate and in the south the Gro\u00dfe Pforte (\"Great Gate\") at the bridge across the Nahe. Belonging to the fortified complex of the Kauzenburg across the Ellerbach from the New Town were the Klappertor and a narrow, defensive ward (zwinger), from which the street known as \"Zwingel\" gets its name. On the bridge over to the ait (or the W\u00f6rth as it is called locally; the river island between the two parts of town) stood the Br\u00fcckentor (\"Bridge Gate\"). To defend the town there was, besides the castle's Burgmannen, also a kind of townsmen's defence force or shooting guild (somewhat like a town militia). Preserved as an incunable print from 1487, printed in Mainz by Peter Sch\u00f6ffer (about 1425\u20131503), is an invitation from the mayor and town council to any and all who considered themselves good marksmen with the crossbow to come to a shooting contest on 23 September.\n\n\n==== Jewish population ====\nOn 31 March 1283 (2 Nisan 5043) in Kreuznach (\u05e7\u05e8\u05d5\u05d9\u05e6\u05e0\u05d0\u05da), Rabbi Ephraim bar Elieser ha-Levi \u2013 apparently as a result of a judicial sentence \u2013 was broken on the wheel. The execution was likely linked to the Mainz blood libel accusations, which in March and April 1283 also led to pogroms in Mellrichstadt, Mainz, Bacharach and Rockenhausen. \nIn 1311, Aaron Judeus de Crucenaco (the last three words mean \"the Jew from Kreuznach\") was mentioned, as was a Jewish toll gatherer from Bingen am Rhein named Abraham von Kreuznach in 1328, 1342 and 1343. In 1336, Emperor Louis the Bavarian allowed Count Johann II of Sponheim-Kreuznach to permanently keep 60 house-owning freed Jews at Kreuznach or elsewhere on his lands (\"\u2026 da\u00df er zu Cre\u00fctzenach oder anderstwoh in seinen landen 60 hau\u00dfges\u00e4s\u00df gefreyter juden ewiglich halten m\u00f6ge \u2026\"). After further persecution in the time of the Plague in 1348/1349, there is no further evidence of Jews in Kreuznach until 1375. By 1382 at the latest, the Jew Gottschalk (who died sometime between 1409 and 1421) from Katzenellenbogen was living in Kreuznach and owned the house at the corner of L\u00e4mmergasse and Mannheimerstra\u00dfe 12 (later: L\u00f6wensteiner Hof) near the Eiermarkt (\"Egg Market\"). On a false charge of usury, Count Simon III of Sponheim (after 1330\u20131414) had him thrown in prison and only released him after payment of a hefty ransom. He was afterwards taken into protection by Ruprecht III of the Palatinate (1352\u20131410) against a yearly payment of 10 Rhenish guilders. At Gottschalk's suggestion, Archbishop Johann of Nassau-Wiesbaden-Idstein (about 1360\u20131419) lifted the \"dice toll\" for Jews crossing the border into the Archbishopric of Mainz. The special taxes for Jews ordered in 1418 and 1434 by King Sigismund of Luxembourg were also imposed in Kreuznach.In the Middle Ages, the eastern part of today's Poststra\u00dfe in the New Town was the Judengasse (\"Jews' Lane\"). The Kleine Judengasse ran from the Judengasse to what is today called Magister-Faust-Gasse. In 1482, a \"Jewish school\" was mentioned, which might already have stood at F\u00e4hrgasse 2 (lane formerly known as Kleine Eselsgass \u2013 \"Little Ass's Lane\"), where the Old Synagogue of Bad Kreuznach later stood (first mentioned here in 1715; new Baroque building in 1737; renovated in 1844; destroyed in 1938; torn down in 1953/1954; last wall remnant removed in 1975). In 1525, Louis V, Elector Palatine (1478\u20131544) allowed Me\u00efr Levi to settle for, at first, twelve years in Kreuznach, to organise the money market there, to receive visits, to lay out his own burial plot and to deal in medicines. In the earlier half of the 16th century, his son, the physician Isaak Levi, whose collection of medical works became well known as Des Juden buch von kreuczenach (\"The Jew's Book of/from Kreuznach\"), lived in Kreuznach. The work is preserved in a manuscript transcribed personally by Louis V, Elector Palatine. The oldest Jewish graveyard in Kreuznach lay in the area of today's Rittergut Bangert (knightly estate), having been mentioned in 1525 and 1636. The Jewish graveyard on Stromberger Stra\u00dfe was bought in 1661 (one preserved gravestone, however, dates from 1630) and expanded in 1919. It is said to be one of the best preserved in Rhineland-Palatinate. The Jewish family Creizenach, originally from Kreuznach, is known from records to have been in Mainz and Frankfurt am Main from 1733, and to have produced a number of important academics (Michael Creizenach, Theodor Creizenach, Wilhelm Creizenach). The Yiddish name for Kreuznach was \u05e6\u05dc\u05dd\u05be\u05de\u05e7\u05d5\u05dd (abbreviated \u05e6\u05f4\u05de), variously rendered in Latin script as Zelem-Mochum or Celemochum (with the initial Z or C intended to transliterate the letter \"\u05e6\", as they would be pronounced /ts/ in German), which literally meant \"Image Place\", for pious Jews wished to avoid the term Kreuz (\"cross\"). In 1828, 425 of the 7,896 inhabitants of the B\u00fcrgermeisterei (\"Mayoralty\") of Kreuznach (5.4%) adhered to the Jewish faith, as did 611 of the town's 18,143 inhabitants (3.4%) in 1890.\n\n\n==== Monasteries ====\nBefore the Thirty Years' War, Kreuznach had some 8,000 inhabitants and seven monasteries. In the Middle Ages and early modern times, the following monasteries were mentioned:\nSaint Mary's Monastery (St. Marien-Kloster; monastery's nature legendary) or Saint Mary's Church (St. Marien-Kirche) on the ait, supposedly endowed by King Dagobert I (d. 639) on the site where Paul's Evangelical Church (Pauluskirche) now stands.\nSaint Kilian's Monastery (Kloster St. Kilian; old parish church; monastery's nature unclear), in the Osterburg (old Roman castrum, Charlemagne's palace) on the Heidenmauer (\"Heathen Wall\") built on the site of the Constantinian Saint Martin's Church (St. Martins-Kirche), first mentioned about 741 and destroyed by the Normans about 891, tied with a hospital in 1310; in the 14th century there was a Beguine cell with prayer house; the monastery was torn down about 1590. The patrocinia of Saint Martin and Saint Kilian were then added to Saint Mary's Church on the ait.\nAugustinian convent of Saint Peter, endowed by Rhinegrave Wolfram I (III) of Stein (d. about 1179) about 1140, incorporated into the Schwabenheim Augustinian monastery in 1437, moved to the so-called Bubenkapelle (\"Lads' Chapel\") in 1491, reoccupied in 1495, dissolved in 1566/1568; the 15 nuns who were driven out went to Eibingen Abbey. In 1624, an attempt to reoccupy the complex by Augustinian monks failed; Jesuits settled there in 1636 and in 1648 they were granted it by agreement, today Oranienhof. The Piet\u00e0 from Saint Peter, for whose reverence a forty-day indulgence was secured from Pope Alexander VI in 1502, was kept until its destruction in 1942 at St. Quintin's Church, Mainz.\nCarmelite Monastery to Saint Nicholas, so-called Schwarz-Kloster (\"Black Monastery\"), endowed in 1281 by the comital House of Sponheim, confirmed in 1290 by Archbishop Gerhard II of Eppstein of Mainz (about 1230\u20131305), dissolved in 1802.\nSaint Anthony's and Saint Catherine's Chapel (St. Antonius-und-St.-Katharinen-Kapelle; also called the Bubenkapelle) on the way into M\u00fchlengasse (\"Mill Lane\"), which belonged to the Schwabenheim Augustinian monastery; it was here, right inside the town, that Count Walram of Sponheim (about 1305\u20131380) moved the Beguine cell from Saint Kilian's, given up in 1437; reoccupied by Augustinian nuns from 1491 to 1495, then moved to Saint Peter's.\nSaint Wolfgang's Franciscan Monastery (Franziskanerkloster St. Wolfgang), endowed in 1472 by Frederick I, Elector Palatine (1425\u20131476) and Count Palatine Frederick I of Simmern (1417\u20131480), confirmed by Pope Sixtus IV (1414\u20131484), dissolved in 1802, now the Gymnasium an der Stadtmauer (\"Gymnasium on the Town Wall\").\nSaint Vincent's Monastery, location unclear, existed in the Thirty Years' War and later.\nJesuit occupation about 1623, 1625 to 1632 and 1636 to 1652 in the quire of the Ait Church (W\u00f6rthkirche), later called the Bridge Church (Br\u00fcckenkirche) and now Paul's Church (Pauluskirche), received in 1631 from Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor (1578\u20131637) Saint Peter's and took ownership in 1636. In Kreuznach, the study prefect Johann Engelbert Oliverius (1588\u20131631) worked and died.\n\n\n==== Plague and leprosy ====\nThe Plague threatened Kreuznach several times throughout its history. Great epidemics are recorded as having broken out in 1348/1349 (Johannes Trithemius spoke of 1,600 victims), 1364, 1501/1502, 1608, 1635 (beginning in September) and 1666 (reportedly 1,300 victims). During the 1501 epidemic, the humanist and Palatine prince-raiser Adam Werner von Themar (1462\u20131537), one of Abbot Trithemius's friends, wrote a poem in Kreuznach about the plague saint, Sebastian. Outside the town, a sickhouse for lepers, the so-called Gutleuthof, was founded on the Gr\u00e4fenbach down from the village of Hargesheim and had its first documentary mention in 1487.\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\nIn the War of the Succession of Landshut against Elector Palatine Philip of the Rhine (1448\u20131508), both the town and the castle were unsuccessfully besieged for six days by Duke Alexander of Zweibr\u00fccken (1462\u20131514) and Landgrave Wilhelm I of Lower Hesse (1499\u20131515), who then laid the surrounding countryside waste. The Sponheim abbot Johannes Trithemius (1462\u20131516) had brought the monasterial belongings, the library and the archive to safety in Kreuznach. The besieged town was relieved by Electoral Palatinate Captain Hans III, Landschad of Steinach (1465\u20131531). In 1507, Master Faust assumed the rector's post at the Kreuznach Latin school, which had been secured for him by Franz von Sickingen. On the grounds of allegations of fornication, he fled the town only a short time afterwards, as witnessed by a letter from Johannes Trithemius to Johannes Virdung, in which Virdung was warned about Faust. Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor (1459\u20131519), who spent Whitsun 1508 in Boppard, stayed in Kreuznach in June 1508 and wrote from there to his daughter Duchess Margaret of Savoy (1480\u20131530). In 1557, the Reformation was introduced into Kreuznach. According to the 1601 Verzeichnis aller Herrlich- und Gerechtigkeiten der St\u00e4tt und D\u00f6rffer der vorderen Grafschaft Sponheim im Ampt Creutznach (\"Directory of All Lordships and Justices of the Towns and Villages of the Further County of Sponheim in the Amt of Kreuznach\"), compiled by Electoral Palatinate Oberamtmann Johann von Eltz-Blieskastel-Wecklingen (1553\u20131610), the town had 807 estates and was the seat of a Hofgericht (lordly court) to which the \"free villages\" of Waldb\u00f6ckelheim, W\u00f6llstein, Volxheim, Braunweiler, Mandel and Roxheim, which were thus freed from the toll at Kreuznach, had to send Sch\u00f6ffen (roughly \"lay jurists\").\n\n\n==== Thirty Years' War ====\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, Kreuznach was overrun and captured many times by various factions fighting in that war:\n\n9 September 1620 [O.S. 31 August 1620] - In the Siege of Bad Kreuznach the town was taken by the Imperial-Spanish troops of General Marquis Ambrogio Spinola (1569\u20131630) under Wilhelm Ferdinand von Effern.  In 1621 Countess Catharina Belgica of Nassau (1578\u20131648) travelled to Kreuznach to see Spinola to ask him to the spare the County of Hanau-M\u00fcnzenberg. The Governors General of the Lower Palatinate, based in Kreuznach, were Don Guillermo de Verdugo di Fauleria (1578\u20131629), Baron von B\u00f6hmisch-Mascha und Tuppau, Don Felipe de Sylva (d. 1644) and Louis de la Tour.\n1 March 1632 [O.S. 20 February 1632] - Kreuznach was taken by Swedish, Saxe-Weimar and English troops under King Gustav II Adolf (1594\u20131632); the castle capitulated on 4 March 1632 [O.S. 23 February 1632]). William Craven and Sir Francis Fane of Fulbeck (about 1611\u20131681?) were both seriously wounded at the conquest of the castle. Serving as commanders were the Scots Colonel Alexander Ramsay (d. 1634) and Lieutenant Colonel (later General and Field Marshal) Robert Douglas (1611\u20131662, raised to Count in 1654). Julius Wilhelm Zincgref (1591\u20131635) was installed in 1632 as the Kreuznach state scrivener by the allied Ludwig Philipp of Palatinate-Simmern.\n14 July 1635 - Imperial troops briefly thrust their way into Kreuznach, but were repulsed by the occupation at the castle.\n6 August 1635 [O.S. 27 July 1635] - Saxe-Weimar and French troops under Duke Bernard of Saxe-Weimar (1604\u20131639) and Louis de Nogaret Cardinal de La Valette (1593\u20131639), together with the Swedes passed through Kreuznach, later passing through once again on 19 September 1635 [O.S. 9 September 1635] as they retreated. Kreuznach's last \"Swedish\" commander was Colonel Johann Georg Stauff (1603\u20131683; raised to nobility in 1661) from Dirmstein.\n20 December 1635 - Kreuznach was taken by Imperial-Spanish and Imperial-Croatian troops under General Matthias Gallas (1588\u20131647). The castle was still held by the Swedes until May 1636 under an armistice upon which both Colonel Stauff and Badish Lieutenant Colonel Bernhard Studnitzky von Beneschau (Studnick\u00fd z Bene\u0161ova) agreed on 9 January 1636 [O.S. 30 December 1635]. Stationed in the town were regiments headed by William, Margrave of Baden-Baden. As neutral ground, Kreuznach was placed under joint Badish and Palatinate-Simmern rule.\n21 November 1639 [O.S. 11 November 1639] - Kreuznach was taken by French and Saxe-Weimar troops under Duke Henri II d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans, Duke of Longueville (1595\u20131663), after town commander Braun von Schmidtburg zu Schweich had gone over to them.\n27 May 1641 [O.S. 17 May 1641] - Bad Kreuznach was captured by Imperial-Bavarian and Imperial-Spanish troops under the Schillerhaas, Generalfeldwachtmeister Gilles de Haes (1597\u20131657) began. An earlier attack in March 1641 had been defeated. The town capitulated on 6 June 1641 [O.S. 27 May 1641], while the fortress held out until 12 June 1641 [O.S. 2 June 1641].\n4 November 1644 [O.S. 25 October 1644] - Kreuznach was taken by French troops under Marshal of France Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne (1611\u20131675) (the castle was held by the Bavarians until 26 December 1644 [O.S. 16 December 1644]) and transferred by Mar\u00e9chal de camp Guy de Bar (1605\u20131695) to Palatinate-Simmern.The town was thus heavily drawn into hardship and woe, and the population dwindled from some 8,000 at the war's outbreak to roughly 3,500. The expression \"Er ist zu Kreuznach geboren\" (\"He was born at Kreuznach\") became a byword in German for somebody who had to struggle with a great deal of hardship. On 19 August 1663, the town was stricken by an extraordinarily high flood on the river Nahe.\n\n\n==== Nine Years' War ====\nIn the Nine Years' War (known in Germany as the Pf\u00e4lzischer Erbfolgekrieg, or War of the Palatine Succession), the Kauzenburg (castle) was conquered on 5 October 1688 by Marshal Louis Fran\u00e7ois, duc de Boufflers (1644\u20131711). The town fortifications and the castle were torn down and the town of Kreuznach largely destroyed in May 1689 by French troops under Brigadier Ez\u00e9chiel du Mas, Comte de M\u00e9lac (about 1630\u20131704) or Lieutenant General Marquis Nicolas du Bl\u00e9 d\u2019Uxelles (1652\u20131730). On 18 October 1689, Kreuznach's churches were burnt down.\n\n\n==== 18th century ====\nAs of 1708, Kreuznach wholly belonged to Electoral Palatinate. Under Elector Palatine Karl III Philipp (1661\u20131742), the Karlshalle Saltworks were built in 1729. Built in 1743 by Prince-Elector, Count Palatine and Duke Karl Theodor (1724\u20131799) were the Theodorshalle Saltworks. On 13 May 1725, after a cloudburst and hailstorm, Kreuznach was stricken by an extreme flood in which 31 people lost their lives, some 300 or 400 head of cattle drowned, two houses were utterly destroyed and many damaged and remaining parts of the town wall fell in. Taking part at the founding of the Masonic Lodge Zum wiedererbauten Tempel der Bruderliebe (\"To the Rebuilt Temple of Brotherly Love\") in Worms in 1781 were also Freemasons from Kreuznach. As early as 1775, the Grand Lodge of the Rhenish Masonic Lodges (8th Provincial Grand Lodge) of Strict Observance had already been given the name \"Kreuznach\". In the extreme winter of 1783/1784, the town was heavily damaged on 27\u201328 February 1784 by an icerun and flooding. A pharmacist named Daniel Riem (1730\u20131784) was killed in his house \"Zum wei\u00dfen Schwan\" (\"At the White Swan\") when it collapsed into the floodwaters.\n\n\n==== French Revolutionary and Napoleonic times ====\n\nIn the course of the Napoleonic Wars (1792\u20131814), French emigrants came to Kreuznach, among them Prince Louis Joseph of Cond\u00e9 (1736\u20131818). In October 1792, French Revolutionary troops under General Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine (1740\u20131793) occupied the land around Kreuznach, remaining there until 28 March 1793. The town itself was briefly occupied by French troops under General Fran\u00e7ois S\u00e9verin Marceau-Desgraviers (1769\u20131796) on 4 January and then again on 16 October 1794. From 30 October until 1 December 1795, the town was held by Imperial troops under Rhinegrave Karl August von Salm-Grumbach (1742\u20131800), but they were at first driven out in bloody battles by Marshals Jean-Baptiste Jourdan (1762\u20131833) and Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte (1763\u20131844). In this time, the town suffered greatly under sackings and involuntary contributions. After the French withdrew on 12 December, it was occupied by an Austrian battalion under Captain Alois Graf Gavasini (1759\u20131834), which withdrew again on 30 May 1796. On 9 June 1796, Kreuznach was once again occupied by the French. In 1797, Kreuznach, along with all lands on the Rhine's left bank, was annexed by the French First Republic, a deed confirmed under international law by the 1801 Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville. The parts of town that lay north of the Nahe were assigned to the Arrondissement of Simmern in the Department of Rhin-et-Moselle, whereas those that lay to the south were assigned to the Department of Mont-Tonnerre (or Donnersberg in German). The subprefect in Simmern in 1800 was Andreas van Recum (1765\u20131828) and in 1806 it was Ludwig von Closen (1752\u20131830). The maire of Kreuznach as of 1800 was Franz Joseph Potthoff (b. 1756; d. after 1806) and beginning in 1806 it was Karl Joseph Burret (1761\u20131828). On 20 September and 5 October 1804, the French Emperor, Napoleon Bonaparte visited Kreuznach. On the occasion of Napoleon's victory in the Battle of Austerlitz a celebratory Te Deum was held at the Catholic churches in January 1806 on Bishop of Aachen Marc-Antoine Berdolet's (1740\u20131809) orders (Kreuznach was part of his diocese from 1801 to 1821). In 1808, Napoleon made a gift of Kreuznach's two saltworks to his favourite sister, Pauline. In 1809, the Kreuznach Masonic Lodge \"Les amis r\u00e9unis de la Nahe et du Rhin\" was founded by van Reccum, which at first lasted only until 1814. It was, however, refounded in 1858. In Napoleon's honour, the timing of the Kreuznach yearly market was set by Mayor Burret on the Sunday after his birthday (15 August). Men from Kreuznach also took part in Napoleon's 1812 Russian Campaign on the French side, to whom a monument established at the Mannheimer Stra\u00dfe graveyard in 1842 still stands. The subsequent German campaign (called the Befreiungskriege, or Wars of Liberation, in Germany) put an end to French rule.\n\n\n==== Congress of Vienna to First World War ====\nUntil a permanent new order could be imposed under the terms of the Congress of Vienna, the region lay under joint Bavarian-Austrian administration, whose seat was in Kreuznach. When these terms eventually came about, Kreuznach passed to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815 and from 1816 it belonged to the Regierungsbezirk of Koblenz in the province of the Grand Duchy of the Lower Rhine (as of 1822 the Rhine Province) and was a border town with two neighbouring states, the Grand Duchy of Hesse to the east and the Bavarian exclave of the Palatinate to the south. The two saltworks, which had now apparently been taken away from Napoleon's sister, were from 1816 to 1897 Grand-Ducal-Hessian state property on Prussian territory. In 1817, Johann Erhard Prieger opened the first bathing parlour with briny water and thereby laid the groundwork for the fast-growing spa business. In 1843, Karl Marx married Jenny von Westphalen in Kreuznach, presumably at the Wilhelmskirche (William's Church), which had been built between 1698 and 1700 and was later, in 1968, all but torn down, leaving only the churchtower. In Kreuznach, Marx set down considerable portions of his manuscript Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right (Zur Kritik der Hegelschen Rechtsphilosophie) in 1843. Clara Schumann, who was attending the spa in Kreuznach, and her half-sister Marie Wieck gave a concert at the spa house in 1860. With the building of the Nahe Valley Railway from Bingerbr\u00fcck to Saarbr\u00fccken in 1858/1860, the groundwork was laid for the town's industrialisation. This, along with the ever-growing income from the spa, led after years of stagnation to an economic boost for the town's development. Nevertheless, the railway was not built for industry and spa-goers alone, but also as a logistical supply line for a war that was expected to break out with France. Before this, though, right at Kreuznach's town limits, Prussia and Bavaria once again stood at odds with each other in 1866. Thinking that was not influenced by this led to another railway line being built even before the First World War, the \"strategic railway\" from Bad M\u00fcnster by way of Staudernheim, Meisenheim, Lauterecken and Kusel towards the west, making Kreuznach into an important contributor to transport towards the west. Only about 1950 were parts of this line torn up and abandoned. Today, between Staudernheim and Kusel, it serves as a tourist attraction for those who wish to ride draisines.\n\nIn 1891, three members of the Franciscan Brothers of the Holy Cross came to live in Kreuznach. In 1893, they took over the hospital Kiskys-W\u00f6rth, which as of 1905 bore the name St. Marienw\u00f6rth. Since 1948, they have run it together with the Sisters of the Congregation of Papal Law of the Maids of Mary of the Immaculate Conception, and today run it as a hospital bearing the classification II. Regelversorgung under Germany's Versorgungsstufe hospital planning system. In 1901, the Second Rhenish Diakonissen-Mutterhaus (\"Deaconess's Mother-House\"), founded in 1889 in Sobernheim, moved under its abbot, the Reverend Hugo Reich (1854\u20131935), to Kreuznach. It is now a foundation known as the kreuznacher diakonie (always written with lowercase initials). In 1904, the pharmacist Karl Aschoff discovered the Kreuznach brine's radon content, and thereafter introduced \"radon balneology\", a therapy that had already been practised in the Austro-Hungarian town of Sankt Joachimsthal in the Bohemian Ore Mountains (now J\u00e1chymov in the Czech Republic). Even though the Bad Kreuznach's radon content was much slighter than that found in the waters from Brambach or Bad Gastein, the town was quickly billed as a \"radium healing spa\" \u2013 the technical error in that billing notwithstanding. In 1912, a radon inhalatorium was brought into service, into which was piped the air from an old mining gallery at the Kauzenberg, which had a higher radon content than the springwater. The inhalatorium was destroyed in 1945. In 1974, however, the old mining gallery itself was converted into a therapy room. To this day, radon inhalation serves as a natural pain reliever for those suffering from rheumatism. In the First World War, both the Kreuznach spa house and other hotels and villas became as of 2 January 1917 the seat of the Great Headquarters of Kaiser Wilhelm II. The Kaiser actually lived in the spa house. Used as the General staff building was the Oranienhof. At the spa house on 19 December 1917, General Mustafa Kemal Pasha \u2013 better known as Atat\u00fcrk (\"Father of the Turks\") and later president of a strictly secular Turkey \u2013 the Kaiser, Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff all met for talks. Only an extreme wintertime flood on the Nahe in January 1918 led to the Oberste Heeresleitung being moved to Spa in Belgium.\n\n\n==== Weimar Republic and Third Reich ====\nAfter the First World War, French troops occupied the Rhineland and along with it, Kreuznach, whose great hotels were thereafter mostly abandoned. In 1924, Kreuznach was granted the designation Bad, literally \"Bath\", which is conferred on places that can be regarded as health resorts. Since this time, the town has been known as Bad Kreuznach. After Adolf Hitler and the Nazis seized power in 1933, some, among them the trade unionist Hugo Salzmann, organised resistance to National Socialism. Despite imprisonment, Salzmann survived the Third Reich, and after 1945 sat on town council for the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). The Jews who were still left in the district after the Second World War broke out were on the district leadership's orders taken in 1942 to the former Kolpinghaus, whence, on 27 July, they were deported to Theresienstadt. Bad Kreuznach, whose spa facilities and remaining hotels once again, from 1939 to 1940, became the seat of the Army High Command, was time and again targeted by Allied air raids because of the Wehrmacht barracks on Bosenheimer Stra\u00dfe, Alzeyer Stra\u00dfe and Franziska-Puricelli-Stra\u00dfe as well as the strategically important Berlin-Paris railway line, which then led through the town. The last Stadtkommandant (town commander), Lieutenant Colonel Johann Kaup (d. 1945), kept Bad Kreuznach from even greater destruction when he offered advancing American troops no resistance, and yielded the town to them on 16 March 1945 with barely any fighting. Shortly before this, German troops had blown up yet another part of the old bridge across the Nahe, thus also destroying residential buildings near the bridge ends.\n\n\n==== After 1945 ====\nBad Kreuznach was occupied by US troops in March 1945 and thus stood under American military authority. This even extended to one of the Rheinwiesenlager for disarmed German forces, which lay near Bad Kreuznach on the road to Bretzenheim, and whose former location is now marked by a memorial. It was commonly known as the \"Field of Misery\". Found in the Lohrer Wald (forest) is a graveyard of honour for wartime and camp victims. Under the Potsdam Protocols on the fixing of occupation zone boundaries, Bad Kreuznach found itself for a while in French zone of occupation, but in an exchange in the early 1950s, United States Armed Forces came back into the districts of Kreuznach, Birkenfeld and Kusel. Until the middle of 2001, the Americans maintained four barracks, a Redstone missile unit, a firing range, a small airfield and a drill ground in Bad Kreuznach. The last US forces in Bad Kreuznach were parts of the 1st Armored Division (\"Old Ironsides\"). In 1958, President of France Charles de Gaulle and Federal Chancellor Konrad Adenauer agreed in Bad Kreuznach to an institutionalisation of the special relations between the two countries, which in 1963 resulted in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Treaty. A monumental stone before the old spa house recalls this historic event. On 1 April 1960, the town of Bad Kreuznach was declared, after application to the state government, a gro\u00dfe kreisangeh\u00f6rige Stadt (\"large town belonging to a district\"). In 2010 Bad Kreuznach launched a competition to replace the 1950s addition to the Alte Nahebr\u00fccke (\"Old Nahe Bridge\"). The bridge, designed by competition winner Dissing+Weitling architecture of Copenhagen, is scheduled for completion by 2012.\n\n\n==== Amalgamations ====\nIn the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate, the hitherto self-administering municipalities of Bosenheim, Planig, Ippesheim (all three of which had belonged until then to the Bingen district) and Winzenheim were amalgamated on 7 June 1969 with Bad Kreuznach. Furthermore, R\u00fcdesheim an der Nahe was also amalgamated, but fought the amalgamation in court, winning, and thereby regaining its autonomy a few months later. As part of the 2009 German federal election, a plebiscite was included on the ballot on the question of whether the towns of Bad Kreuznach and Bad M\u00fcnster am Stein-Ebernburg should be merged, and 68.3% of the Bad Kreuznach voters favoured negotiations between the two towns. On 25 May 2009, the town received another special designation, this time from the Cabinet: Ort der Vielfalt \u2013 \"Place of Diversity\".\n\n\n== Religion ==\nAs at 31 August 2013, there are 44,851 full-time residents in Bad Kreuznach, and of those, 15,431 are Evangelical (34.405%), 13,355 are Catholic (29.776%), 4 belong to the Old Catholic Church (0.009%), 77 belong to the Greek Orthodox Church (0.172%), 68 belong to the Russian Orthodox Church (0.152%), 1 is United Methodist (0.002%), 16 belong to the Free Evangelical Church (0.036%), 41 are Lutheran (0.091%), 2 belong to the Palatinate State Free Religious Community (0.004%), 1 belongs to the Mainz Free Religious Community (0.002%), 4 are Reformed (0.009%), 9 belong to the Alzey Free Religious Community (0.02%), 2 form part of a membership group in a Jewish community (0.004%) (162 other Jews belong to the Bad Kreuznach-Koblenz worship community [0.361%] while a further one belongs to the State League of Jewish worship communities in Bavaria [0.002%]), 9 are Jehovah's Witnesses (0.02%), 1 belongs to yet another free religious community (0.002%), 5,088 (11.344%) belong to other religious groups and 10,579 (23.587%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Town council ===\nThe council is made up of 44 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the chief mayor as chairwoman. Since this election, the town has been run by a Jamaica coalition of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany, the Free Democratic Party and the Greens.\nThe municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:\n\n\n=== Mayors ===\nListed here are Bad Kreuznach's mayors since Napoleonic times:\n\n\n=== Mayor ===\nBad Kreuznach's chief mayor (Oberb\u00fcrgermeisterin) is Dr. Heike Kaster-Meurer, her deputy mayor (B\u00fcrgermeisterin) is Martina Hassel and her council deputies (Beigeordnete) are Wolfgang Heinrich, Udo Bausch and Andrea Manz.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe town's arms might be described thus: On an escutcheon argent ensigned with a town wall with three towers all embattled Or, a fess countercompony Or and azure between three crosses patt\u00e9e sable.\nBad Kreuznach's right to bear arms comes from municipal law for the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The three crosses patt\u00e9e (that is, with the ends somewhat broader than the rest of the crosses' arms) are a canting charge, referring to the town's name, the German word for \"cross\" being Kreuz. The crosses are sometimes wrongly taken to be Christian crosses. In fact, the name Kreuznach developed out of the Celtic-Latin word Cruciniacum, which meant \"Crucinius's Home\", thus a man's name with the suffix \u2014acum added, meaning \"flowing water\". The coat of arms first appeared with this composition on the keystone at Saint Nicholas's Church in the late 13th century. The mural crown on top of the escutcheon began appearing only about 1800 under French rule. The stylised stretch of town wall was originally rendered reddish-brown, but it usually appears gold nowadays.\n\n\n=== Town partnerships ===\nBad Kreuznach fosters partnerships with the following places:\n Bourg-en-Bresse, Ain, France since 1963\n Neuruppin, Ostprignitz-Ruppin, Brandenburg since 1990\n\n\n== Culture and sightseeing ==\n\n\n=== Buildings ===\nThe following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate's Directory of Cultural Monuments:\n\n\n==== Bad Kreuznach (main centre) ====\nPaul's Evangelical Church (Pauluskirche), Kurhausstra\u00dfe 2/4 \u2013 Late Gothic quire and transept, early 15th century, west fa\u00e7ade after 1458, Classicist nave and tower 1768\u20131781, architect Philipp Heinrich Hellermann, Meisenheim;

many individual monuments such as the spa house (1840\u20131860), four-winged bathhouse (1911/1912), private bathhouses (Late Classicist and Renaissance Revival), especially monuments created by the sculptor family Cauer and bronze figures, saltworks (Karlshalle, Theodorshalle); in the south a jutting, pointed area bordered in the east by the railway line, in the north by Baumstra\u00dfe/Salinenstra\u00dfe/Schlo\u00dfstra\u00dfe, the millpond and the old bridge across the Nahe, in the west by a strip along the bank on the other side of the Nahe.\nNew Town (Neustadt, monumental zone) \u2013 historically expanded development in the part of town founded after 1200 by the Counts of Sponheim north of the Nahe including the Ellerbach: late mediaeval Saint Nicholas's Church (St. Nikolauskirche), cellar and ground floor, partly also upper floors, with later upper floors added, former castle houses and nobles' houses from the 16th or 17th century as well as the town scrivener's office from 1540, timber-frame houses from the 18th century with Classicist and Renaissance Revival fa\u00e7ades from the 19th century and Wilhelmsbr\u00fccke (bridge) in imitation of Historicist style with towers from 1906\nTown fortifications \u2013 The town fortifications are made up of three complete wall systems around sovereign area (Burgfrieden), Neustadt (\"New Town\") and Altstadt (\"Old Town\") with outward ditches, wall towers and gate towers, first mentioned in 1247, destroyed in 1689, repaired in the 18th century, in late 18th century ditches filled in, beginning about 1840, walls torn down or integrated into new buildings;

It supports houses built from 1582 to 1612, and it is one of the few remaining bridges with buildings on it.\nThe Pauluskirche (St. Paul's Church), where Karl Marx was married to Jenny von Westphalen on 19 June 1843.\nThe Kurhaus (built in 1913) is a hotel and bath house. The baths which give the town its special designation contain the noble gas radon, with supposedly curative properties.\nThe Dr-Faust-Haus (built in 1507) was the home of Johann Georg Faust, the alchemist on whom the Faust tale is said to be based.\nTwo mosaics from a Roman villa (about AD 250) are displayed in an on-site museum, the R\u00f6merhalle. The tombstone of Tiberius Julius Abdes Pantera is also on view here.\nBad Kreuznach's wine is well known.\nFor 50 years Kreuznach was home to a United States Army base, Rose Barracks, including headquarters of the U.S. 8th Infantry Division, including the 8th Signal Battalion, and the 8th Intelligence Co., and later the U.S. 1st Armored Division, which closed down in May 2001\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Music clubs and choirs ===\nCapella Nicolai\nChor Cantamus\nChor Mosaik\nChor Reinhard \u2013 newly founded men's Christian choir\nGospelchor Grenzenlos \u2013 \"Borderless\" Gospel choir\nKantorei der Pauluskirche \u2013 Paul's Evangelical Church choir\nKonzertgesellschaft Bad Kreuznach \u2013 concert company\nKreuznacher-Diakonie-Kantorei \u2013 diaconal choir\nMC Harmonie 1845 Planig e.V.\nMusikverein \"Musikfreunde Winzenheim\" e.

A full list of prizewinners since the award's introduction can be seen at the link. In 2013, the prize was not awarded owing to cost-cutting measures.\n\n\n=== Sport and leisure ===\n\n\n==== Sport clubs ====\nIn Bad Kreuznach there are many clubs that can boast of successes at the national level. In trampolining and whitewater slalom, the town is a national stronghold, while it has also shown strength at the state level in shooting sports and bocce. The biggest club is VfL 1848 Bad Kreuznach, within which the first basketball department in any sport club in Germany was founded in 1935. After the Second World War, too, the club produced many important personalities, among them several players at the national level. Moreover, the club's field hockey department is also of importance, having for a while been represented in the Damen-Bundesliga (\"Ladies' National League\"). The first field hockey department in a Bad Kreuznach sport club, however, was the Kreuznacher HC, which made it to the semi-finals at the German Championship in 1960, and which to this day stages the Easter Hockey Tournament. In football, the town's most successful club is Eintracht Bad Kreuznach. The team played in, among other leagues, the Oberliga, when that was Germany's highest level in football, as well as, later, the Second Bundesliga. The club that has won the most titles is MTV Bad Kreuznach, which in trampolining is among Germany's most successful clubs. Canoeing, in particular whitewater slalom, is practised by RKV Bad Kreuznach. Creuznacher RV has a long tradition in rowing. Also important are the shooting sport clubs SG Bad Kreuznach 1847 and BSC Bad Kreuznach. In disabled sports, the Sportfreunde Diakonie especially has been successful, particularly in bocce.\n\n\n==== Town of Bad Kreuznach Sport Badge ====\nThe Sportplakette der Stadt Bad Kreuznach is an honour awarded by the town once each year to individual sportsmen or sportswomen, whole teams, worthy promoters of sports and worthy people whose jobs are linked to sports. With this award, the town also hopes to underscore its image as a sporting town in Rhineland-Palatinate. The Sport Badge is conferred upon sportsmen or sportswomen at three levels:\n\nGold\nParticipation in a world championship or the Olympic Games\nWorld Cup ranking 1st to 3rd place\n1st to 3rd place at European championships\nSilver\nWorld Cup ranking 4th or 5th place\nEuropean championships 4th or 5th place\n1st place at German championships\nBronze\nWorld Cup ranking 6th or 7th place\nParticipation in a European championship\n2nd or 3rd place at a German championshipA promoter or person working in a sport-related field must be active in an unpaid capacity for at least 25 years to receive this award.\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Winegrowing ===\nBad Kreuznach is characterised to a considerable extent by winegrowing, and with 777 ha of vineyard planted \u2013 77% white wine varieties and 23% red \u2013 it is the biggest winegrowing centre in the Nahe wine region and the seventh biggest in Rhineland-Palatinate.\n\n\n=== Industry and trade ===\nBad Kreuznach has roughly 1,600 businesses with at least one employee, thereby offering 28,000 jobs, of which half are filled by commuters who come into town from surrounding areas. The economic structure is thus characterised mainly by small and medium enterprises, but also some big businesses like the tire manufacturer Michelin, the machine builder KHS, the Meffert Farbwerke (dyes, lacquers, plasters, protective coatings) and the Jos. Schneider Optische Werke GmbH may be mentioned. In 2002, the tradition-rich Seitz-Filter-Werke was taken over by the US-based Pall Corporation. Thus producing businesses are of great importance, and are especially well represented by the chemical industry (tires, lacquers, dyes) and the optical industry as well as machine builders and automotive suppliers. Retail and wholesale dealers, as well as restaurants hold particular weight in the inner town, although in the last few years, the service sector, too, has been gaining in importance. The express road links to the Autobahn bring Bad Kreuznach closer to Frankfurt Airport. The town can also attract new investment with its economic conversion areas.\n\n\n=== Spa and tourism ===\n\nThe spa operations and the wellness tourism also hold a special place for the town as the world's oldest radon-brine spa and the Rhineland-Palatinate centre for rheumatic care. Available in town are 2,498* beds for guests, which out of 449,756* overnight stays have seen 270,306* stays by guests in rehabilitation clinics. All together, the town was visited by 92,700 overnight guests (*as of 31 December 2010). Also available to the spa operations are six spa clinics, spa sanatoria, the thermal brine movement bath \"Crucenia Thermen\" with a salt grotto, a radon gallery, graduation towers in the Salinental (dale), the brine-fogger in the Kurpark (spa park) set up as open-air inhalatoria and the \"Crucenia Gesundheitszentrum\" (\"Crucenia Health Centre\") for ambulatory spa treatment. The indications for these treatments are for rheumatic complaints, changes in joints due to gout, degenerative diseases of the spinal column and joints, women's complaints, illnesses of the respiratory system, paediatric illnesses, vascular illnesses, non-infectious skin diseases, endocrinological dysfunctions, psychosomatic illnesses and eye complaints. After the noticeable decline in the spa business in the mid 1990s, there was a remodelling of the healing spa. At the Saunalandschaft bathhouse rose a \"wellness temple\" with 12 great saunas on an area of 4 000 m2, which receives roughly 80,000 visitors every year.\n\n\n=== Hospitals and specialised clinics ===\nIn the hospital run by kreuznacher diakonie (397 beds) and the St. Marienw\u00f6rth hospital (Franciscan brothers), Bad Kreuznach has at its disposal two general hospitals that have available the most modern specialised departments for heart and intestinal disorders, and also strokes. In the spa zone, there is also the \"Sana\" Rhineland-Palatinate Rheumatic Centre, made up of a rheumatic hospital and a rehabilitation clinic, the Karl-Aschoff-Klinik. Another rehabilitation clinic under private sponsorship is the Klinik Nahetal. Also, there are the psychosomatic specialised clinic St.-Franziska-Stift and the rehabilitation and preventive clinic for children and youth, Viktoriastift.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nGiven Bad Kreuznach's location in the narrow Nahe valley, all transport corridors run upstream parallel to the river. Moreover, the town is an important crossing point for all modes of transport.\n\n\n==== Rail ====\n\nFrom 1896 to 1936, there were the Kreuznacher Kleinbahnen (\"Kreuznach Narrow-Gauge Railways\"), a rural narrow-gauge railway network. An original steam locomotive and its shed, which were moved from Winterburg, can be found today in nearby Bockenau. The Kreuznacher Stra\u00dfen- und Vorortbahnen (\"Kreuznach Tramways and Suburban Railways\") ran not only a service within the town but also lines out into the surrounding area, to Bad M\u00fcnster am Stein, Langenlonsheim and Sankt Johann. In 1953, the whole operation was shut down. Since the introduction of \"Rhineland-Palatinate Timetabling\" (Rheinland-Pfalz-Takt) in the mid 1990s, the train services other than the ICE/EC/IC services have once again earned some importance. Besides the introduction of hourly timetabling, there has also been a marked expansion into the nighttime hours, with trains leaving for Mainz three hours later each day. Bad Kreuznach station is one of Rhineland-Palatinate's few V-shaped stations (called a Keilbahnhof, or \"wedge station\", in the German terminology). Branching off the Nahe Valley Railway (Bingen\u2013Saarbr\u00fccken) here is the railway line to Gau Algesheim. From Bingen am Rhein, Regionalbahn trains run by way of the Alsenz Valley Railway, which branches off the Nahe Valley Railway in Bad M\u00fcnster am Stein, to Kaiserslautern, reaching it in roughly 65 minutes. Running on the line to Saarbr\u00fccken and by way of Gau Algesheim and the West Rhine Railway to Mainz are Regional-Express and Regionalbahn trains. The travel time to Mainz lies between 25 and 40 minutes, and to Saarbr\u00fccken between 1 hour and 40 minutes and 2 hours and 20 minutes.\n\n\n==== Road ====\nBad Kreuznach can be reached by car through the like-named interchange on the Autobahn A 61 as well as on Bundesstra\u00dfen 41, 48 and 428. Except for Bundesstra\u00dfe 48, all these roads skirt the inner town, while the Autobahn is roughly 12 km from the town centre. Local public transport is provided by a town bus network with services running at 15- or 30-minute intervals. There are seven bus routes run by Verkehrsgesellschaft Bad Kreuznach (VGK), which is owned by the company Rhenus Veniro. Furthermore, there is a great number of regional bus routes serving the nearby area, run by VGK and Omnibusverkehr Rhein-Nahe GmbH (ORN). The routes run by the various carriers are all part of the Rhein-Nahe-Nahverkehrsverbund (\"Rhine-Nahe Local Transport Association\").\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\n\n==== Broadcast ====\nAntenne Bad Kreuznach radio station\ndomradio Studio-Nahe UKW 87,9, clerical radio, domradio K\u00f6ln repeater, local station on Saturday morning and church service broadcast on Sunday\nB\u00fcrgerfernsehen Offener Kanal Bad Kreuznach, public access television channel\n\n\n==== Print media ====\nAllgemeine Zeitung Bad Kreuznach: daily newspaper for Bad Kreuznach and area, owned by Verlagsgruppe Rhein Main. circulation roughly 13,000.\nOeffentlicher Anzeiger: daily newspaper for Bad Kreuznach and area, owned by Rhein-Zeitung (Mittelrhein-Verlag). circulation roughly 22,000.\nConcerned with town history: Bad Kreuznacher Heimatbl\u00e4tter, irregularly appearing insert in the Oeffentlichen Anzeiger\nVorSicht \u2013 Das Rhein-Nahe-Journal. circulation 15,000\nLifetime: town magazine for Bad Kreuznach\nWochenspiegel Bad Kreuznach: weekly advertising flyer, owned by SW-Verlag.\nKreuznacher Rundschau, until 1 October 2010: Neue Kreuznacher Zeitung: weekly advertising flyer.

From 1956 until its closure in 1976, it bore the name Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Landarbeit und Landtechnik. From 1971 to 1987, the discipline of cultivation of the Fachhochschule Rheinland-Pfalz, Bingen, was located in Bad Kreuznach. Since it moved away to Bingen, Bad Kreuznach has been offering collegelike training for aspirant winemakers and agricultural technologists with the DLR (Dienstleistungszentrum L\u00e4ndlicher Raum). This two-year Technikerschule f\u00fcr Weinbau und Oenologie sowie Landbau is a path within the agricultural economics college. It continues the tradition of the former, well known H\u00f6heren Weinbauschule (\"Higher Winegrowing School\") and the Ingenieurschule f\u00fcr Landbau (\"Engineering School for Cultivation\") and fills a gap in the training between Fachhochschule and one-year Fachschule. The Agentur f\u00fcr Qualit\u00e4tssicherung, Evaluation und Selbstst\u00e4ndigkeit von Schulen (\"Agency for Quality Assurance, Evaluation and Independence of Schools\") and the P\u00e4dagogisches Zentrum Rheinland-Pfalz (\"Rhineland-Palatinate Paedagogical Centre\"), the latter of which the state's schools support with their further paedagogical and didactic development, likewise have their seats in the town, as does the Staatliche Studienseminar Bad Kreuznach (a higher teachers' college). The Evangelical Church in the Rhineland maintained from 1960 to 2003 a seminary in Bad Kreuznach to train vicars.\n\n\n== Famous people ==\n\n\n=== Honorary citizens ===\nThus far, 15 persons have been named honorary citizens of the town of Bad Kreuznach.

In the early 17th century this was integrated into the residential palace (today Markt 9).\nIn Daniel Defoe's (1660\u20131731) novel Robinson Crusoe, which came out in 1719, the title character tells the reader that his mother's family originally bore the name \"Kreutznaer\" and had emigrated to England by way of Bremen. Since then, the surname Crusoe has been taken to be a corruption of the word Kreuznacher (\"person from Kreuznach\"). In 1720, at first anonymously, Defoe's novel Memoirs of a Cavalier appeared, in which receipts from \"Creutznach\" are described.\nMarcel Proust visited the town with his mother in 1895.\nBad Kreuznach is known among photographers as the home of Schneider Optische Werke, a famous photographic lens maker.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAll these works are in German:\n\nJohann Goswin Widder: Versuch einer vollst\u00e4ndigen Geographisch-Historischen Beschreibung der Kurf\u00fcrstl.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Neanderthal Museum is a museum in Mettmann, Germany. Located at the site of the first Neanderthal man discovery in the Neandertal, it features an exhibit centered on human evolution. The museum was constructed in 1996 to a design by the architects Zamp Kelp, Julius Krauss and Arno Brandlhuber and draws about 170,000 visitors per year. The museum also includes an archaeological park on the original discovery site, a Stone Age workshop, as well as an art trail named \"human traces\". All signs in the museum as well as the audio guide offered by the museum are available in German and English.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe architectural plan for the museum was chosen through a competition held in the spring of 1993 in which 130 participants from Germany and other countries participated. The design submitted by Professor G\u00fcnter Zamp Kelp, Julius Krauss and Arno Brandlhuber was chosen as it represented the importance of the location. The museum was established on 10 October 1996 near the site where the renowned Neanderthal fossil was found. Its multimedia exhibition was upgraded in 2006. Continuing donations, endowment or testamentary of funding are helpful for further development of the museum and for acquisition of many more exhibits.\nThe former hotel Neanderthaler Hof was demolished to make room for the museum's extension.\n\n\n== Exhibits ==\nThe museum gives a background of the migration of people from the savannas to the modern cities with emphasis of Neanderthals. Their life size models are cast and exhibited on the basis of fossils excavated from archaeological sites. The exhibits are displayed in the four floors of the building which are interconnected through a spiraling ramp. At the beginning of the ramp, in the first section, there are exhibits on the history of the Neanderthal named \"A valley and its Secret\", which provides information on relics of the skeleton of the Neanderthal. The next exhibit, \u201cA journey through time\u201d, is about crucial stages of human history. Based on the main subject \"Evolution of Humankind\",  the thematic areas spread over five sections exhibit sequentially the \"Life and Survival\", \"Tools and Knowledge\", \"Myth and Religion\", Environment and Nourishment\" and \"Communication and Society\".The museum has a unique collection of casts of the original human fossils which represent the evolution of the hominids in general and that of the Neanderthals in particular. This cast collection, prepared on the basis of finds from various excavated sites in the world, was facilitated by the donations given by Alfred Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation.The museum also houses the NESPOS Society e.V. (Pleistocene People and Places) which provides an interactive database on all anthropological and archaeological data connected with the Neanderthals in the form of \"3D\u2013images of CT-Scans and surface scans, as well as high-resolution photographs of human fossils and artifacts\u201d. Software, developed digitally by NESPOS on the basis of all fossil collections, is distributed freely, which includes scans of 600 fossils and artifacts from Belgium, Croatia, France and Germany.\n\n\n=== Special exhibitions ===\nThe museum houses special exhibitions. The last exhibition on monkeys finished in October 2012 was developed by the museum at a cost of \u20ac120,000. A total of 43,000 visitors saw this exhibition, which makes it one of the more popular ones, and it will next be able to be seen at the Naturhistorisches Museum in Braunschweig. The next special exhibition at the Neanderthal Museum will feature wolves and was created by the G\u00f6rlitz branch of the Naturmuseum Senckenberg; it will open on 18 November 2012 and will be on display until 17 March 2013.  Over the course of this exhibition, dog owners are allowed to take their dogs into the museum on four days; this initiative is based on the precedent by the Phaeno Science Center in Wolfsburg that has an annual dog day.\n\n\n== Services ==\n\n\n=== Research ===\nThe Neanderthal Museum Foundation, apart from its present exhibits, also supports research with an interdisciplinary academic approach with particular emphasis on research of the early history of humanity. International excavations and research projects are also actively pursued programmes. The museum encourages lay people to facilitate investigations on local prehistory. The Museum has the world\u2019s largest database on glacial archaeology, under the title \"NESPOS\". Its activities include holding international conferences and symposiums on a regular basis, which \"generate interdisciplinary contacts and spark new ideas and perspectives\" and the proceedings of which are published in scientific series published by the museum. The museum\u2019s work in archaeological and palaeo-anthropological research is succinctly displayed through the audio visuals screened with the aid of several types of  multimedia equipment. The museum has an exhaustive collection of scientific publications and movies related to the prehistory of Europe and western Asia and also many scientific journals and monographs which can referred at the media centre.\n\n\n=== Education programmes ===\nThe museum specifically operates a programme to disseminate knowledge to teachers (including pre-school teachers) through its Permanent Exhibition and Stone Age Workshop. Children are also encouraged to learn from the exhibits which are not part of the school curriculum. In this regard the display areas in the garden such as the Discovery Site, the \u201cHuman Traces\u201d art trail and the Ice Age Game Reserve are very topical for children in particular. The Neanderthal Museum also conducts a workshop on the Stone Age, which is educative not only to children but also to the youth and older people. In this workshop, access is provided to prehistoric fossils like bone, leather or sinew, prehistoric tools and techniques used in the daily life of our ancestors.\n\n\n== Grounds ==\nIn the garden area, which is developed in the precincts of the museum to represent the Neander Valley, there are many attractions along the labelled paths labelled such as Art trail \"Human Traces\u201d. Further, towards the Game reserve, the aurochs and the wild horses can be seen. The original excavated site where fossils of Neanderthal man were found is also close to the museum.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nThe museum has received many appreciation medals for architecture, exhibits, its website and tourism, between 1997 and 2009, and these are:\nArchitekturpreis Beton 1997, by the Bundesverband der Deutschen Zementindustrie (Federal Association of the German Cement Industry)\n\"Auszeichnung guter Bauten\", BDA-Award D\u00fcsseldorf 1997,  by the Bund Deutscher Architekten (Federation of German Architects)\nEuropean Museum of the Year Award Special Commendation 1998,  by the European Museums Forum\n\"Architektur Preis Nordrhein-Westfalen 1998\", by the Bund Deutscher Architekten (Federation of German Architects)\n\u201cGoldstar-Award\u201d in 1999 for the Website by the International Council of Museums; Rheinland Award 2000 for innovative tourism management in the Rhineland\n\"Neuere deutsche Architektur - Eine reflexive Moderne\" (current architecture in Germany - a reflexive modern way) by  a national and international committee for the special exhibition in 2002\nSpecial award of the Neanderthal Museum, in 2003, for the best concept of life and presentation of culture by the Foundation \"Lebendige Stadt\"\nSelected place in the \"country of ideas\" in 2006, by the initiative \"Deutschland - Land der Ideen\" (Germany - country of ideas)\nSelected place in the \"country of ideas\", in 2009,  by the initiative \"Deutschland - Land der Ideen\" (Germany - country of ideas).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "We took this option as part of a Scenic river cruise, and so pleased that we did. Our guide was very knowledgeable, and the whole museum was very well put together and thought out. It was interesting to see the life-size models. I would highly recommend this museum - so much",

          "My husband and I enjoyed our visit to the museum. Priced at 9 euros, we thought this was a good value. The information is presented in English and German. If you don't know one of these languages well, you will not get very much out of the visit. The information is presented",
          "This is a modern museum with commentary in English as well as German. It explains how they found the first ever Neanderthal remains and how it fits into the human story. My wife is not a huge museum fan but even she enjoyed the visit. Plan a couple of hours to fully walk around",

          "I think this attraction is better suited to the younger visitor, it was a pleasant experience but it lack 'something'. The commentary that went with the exhibits was in English as well as German (which was good as my German is non existent) but there didn't seem to be much",
          "Came here as something to do in dussledorf and really enjoyed it, if I'm honest I expected to be a bit bored but I wasn't at all, it was great - really interesting and informative! and they supplied headphones so all the information was available in English! They even let us",
          "Its ok in general. Not much informative and is small. Has activities for kids and familes, but has not so much information",
          "Unfortunately I thought the Neanderthal Museum was a \"must see\". But it turned out to be a place with seeing for kids or family's. But the visit to this Museum can be combined with a longer walk in the near nature reserve where the actual Neanderthal Man was found",
          "The museum is an amazing exhibition of the findings of the Neanderthals..good place to learn , the displays are nice and well explained also in English language . Nice place to take kids from 4 to 16 years old ....or older good place to go with the family . Also outside you can",

        "wiki": "The Kunstpalast is an art museum in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Museum Kunst Palast was founded as Kunstmuseum D\u00fcsseldorf, a typical communal arts collection in Germany. The first exhibits were given by the popular regent Jan Wellem, Duke of Palatinate, and his wife Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici and some rich citizens of D\u00fcsseldorf. The number of exhibits was expanded in the 19th century by the collection of Lambert Krahe, formerly a collection for educational reasons of the Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf. The D\u00fcsseldorfer Gallerieverein, founded in the 19th century, collected many drawings of the D\u00fcsseldorfer Malerschule, later given to that collection. The museum for advanced arts, whose opening was in 1883, merged with that museum later. \nThe Kunstmuseum in its actual form opened in 1913, it became a foundation (in private-public partnership) called: \"Stiftung museum kunst palast\" in 2000.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe Ehrenhof was built in 1925 for the exhibition \"GeSoLei\" (short \u201eGESOLEI\u201c, germ.: \"health, social care and sports\"). Construction plans of the building are made by the architect Wilhelm Kreis. The Communal Arts Collection and the Hetjens-Museum for ceramics moved into the Ehrenhof building in 1928. In 1969 the ceramis moved to the Palais Nesselrode at the Schulstra\u00dfe in D\u00fcsseldorf-Carlstadt. There is also the NRW-Forum Kultur und Wirtschaft (forum for culture and economy of North Rhine-Westphalia) in the same building complex.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nThe Museum Kunst Palast includes objects of fine arts from Classical antiquity to the present, including drawings, sculptures, a collection of more than 70,000 graphic exhibits  and photographs, applied arts and design and one of Europe's largests glass collections.\n\nModern Art\nSculpture / Applied Art\nPaintings\nPrints and Drawings\nHelmut Hentrich Glass MuseumThe graphic collection includes 14,000 Italian baroque graphics. The collection presents several works from Europe, Japan, Persia/Iran, beginning with the 3rd century BC. The art collection also include works from periods such as Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque,  the time of Goethe, the 19th century, the 20th century including a large collection of ZERO works, and the present.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Affiliated Institutes ==\nThe Archive for artistical photography of the rhenanian artscene (AFORK) is part of the Modern Department and has an extension collection of prints and will be part of a future Research Center for the Arts at the museum.\nThe ZERO foundation, founded by the Museum Kunst Palast together with the three ZERO artists Heinz Mack, G\u00fcnther Uecker und Otto Piene, has temporary offices, with an extensive archive, in the New Harbour, and will be part of a future Research Center for the Arts at the museum.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nAmong several exhibitions of archival material, the Museum Kunstpalast has already hosted some exhibitions on Old Masters as well, including:\n\nAn exhibition of paintings by Caravaggio (from 2006 to 2007)\nThe biggest exhibition of El Greco paintings in Germany since several decades. The exhibition showed their influence on Modern Art. It took place in 2012\nAn exhibition of paintings by Spanish baroque painter Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n (from 2015 to 2016)\n\n\n== References ==\n\nmuseum kunst palast, D\u00fcsseldorf with articles written by Bettina Baumg\u00e4rtel, Sonja Brink, Christoph Danelzik-Br\u00fcggemann, Jean-Hubert Martin, Helmut Ricke, Dieter Scholz, Barbara Til, Stephan von Wiese.

          "The museum is quite nice with good objects. But, its kind of confusing how the tour is, the object information plats is not in english and in every room there is a guard following your every step all the time at close distant.",
          "Nice, large collection mainly of old art, but the most important part is their glass art collection. Worth a short visit.",
          "The glass works exhibit on the first floor is exceptional both in its range from the ancient to modern works. Nicely set up and extensive. This is not to diminish the sculpture and paintings which are also well presented and wide ranging. Good collection of modern pieces.",
          "Do you know what Netsukes are? Visit this museum and find out. You can find a wide variety of art objects here which will tease your senses. Building seems architecture of 30's, giving you the flavor of the period of that time. Recommend visit, it takes about 2 hours going",
          "Renovated soviet style building with excellent collection of old masters, and contemporary Duesseldorf artists. One major gallery closd for repairs in 2017, check website. Highlights: Renaissance wood sculpture, Rubens room.",
          "This is a large museum with a fine collection for every taste. When I visited there was a small exhibition about Entartete Kunst during the Nazi era. Another section had spectacular religious woodwork from around 15th century and more. But the best collection was in the",
          "A great experience here at the Kunstpalast. Currently there is the Lucas Cranach the Elder exhibition which is a real to-do. I came to see the works of Caspar David Friedrich; but was pleasantly surprised by the high level of the Cranach exhibit stretching all the way to the",
          "Museum Kunstpalast hosts really nice exhibitions. Even after half a dozen visits we can confirm there is a wide variety in themes of the collections, each time very successful accompanying audioguides are offered (included in entrance fee). Besides the specific exhibitions",
          "I didn't go inside the museum, but I really liked to go there because I enjoyed the square in front of the museum.",
          "I loved the Lucas Cranach exhibition, really well presented with a fascinating audioguide, and the section at the end on Cranach's influence on modern painters was brilliant. Great that photos weren't allowed - it irritates me when people snap away rather than look at the art.",
          "Lucas Cranach exhibition did not deserve such a presentation . Having such an unique artist with his work almost 500 years ago to show, needed more passion and engagement . Just look what Museum are doing in other countries like Ottawa in Canada, Amsterdam or Brussels or",
          "The layout is rather strange, the collections are spread between buildings and as a result I ended up missing half of the collections. The ticket sales person asked me if I wanted a ticket for the whole museum or just one building and I chose just one thinking everything would",
          "We saw the exhibition 'behind the curtain', which had a great range of artists. The other galleries had fantastic paintings, which we assume were permanently on display. I did not expect to be blown away by so much of the work in the glass museum, but I was. This is most",
          "We loved it. The glass collection was the best, from earliest utilitarian pieces to modern art exhibits. Almost a small museum in it's own right. Check out the current visiting exhibition as well, and if you like the sound of that, it's worth a visit.",
          "After the K20 museum, I thought this was the other interesting art museum in Dusseldorf. The layout as some have mention is a bit odd, but nothing to dampen the experience. For me the highlights included the Modern Art, with works by Kirchner, Marc, Dix, Macke, Hockney and",
          "But depends mostly on the exhibitions taking place there! However it\u00b4s definitely a place to visit from time to time",
          "Spent a rainy morning here to visit the art collection. Interesting exhibition and some very historical pieces of art. Layout between the two buildings is odd and somewhat difficult to navigate but still worth the visit. Do not arrive early as there is no place to have coffee",
          "Fifteen minutes after entering the museum my son and I were verbally abused by the guard/museum attendant on the first floor and left. I was carrying a small oblong shaped backpack with very expensive Canon camera equipment in it. I made sure to speak with the guard on ground",
          "***Please note that the museum is closed on Mondays \ud83d\ude2c This is one of my favorite museums in the world. It is not too crowded so you can enjoy the place without any distractions. Jean Tinguely exhibit was so great.. Also the glass art exhibit was wonderful\ud83d\ude0a I have gone there",
          "The main displays on view were by Jean Tinguely his Super MetaMaxi a collection of very over the top mechanical absurdities ,my wife has seen better scrap yards(quote). The museum is a nice place and a lovely walk through a nice park from the old town entrance fees also get you",

          "If you like art and know about it this is the place for you. the've got some prints and then they have a big (huge) area with renaissance art where you can see some amazing things. There's another part with some art by Joseph Boyce, I think he studied in Dusseldolf. And there is",

          "When I was there, they had an awesome exhibit with works from a major Baroque artist, which made the visit exceptional. Of course, they won't always have that same special exhibit, but I'm sure that they have something regularly. But I still feel confident giving this five stars",
          "This has such an etherial exhibit in an atrium style with a modern white tree with lights on it in the middle of the museum. I loved this place.",
          "but that's about all. It is an impressive exhibit and discusses the history of glass as decorative art from ancient times to the present- the rest of the museum is weak.",
          "I had a really tough time finding this hotel. I took the train and then walked. There were not many people on foot - on the street or near the museum. I entered the doorway across from the entrance even though both were labeled Kunstpalast... I was shocked that there were not",
          "I don't know whether I went to this or not. K20 and K21 i did and got a free taxi shuttle between the two museums.If this was the one by Tonhalle then I missed it as it was closed as most museums on MONDAYS. Better co-ordination and info for Tourists?!! Numbers in Dusseldorf",
          "Large museum a little way north of the Altstadt - just follow the Rhine to get there. It has separate areas with modern art, older art - including a whole room of paintings by Rubens - and a particularly fine glass section. It also holds special exhibitions on a regular basis.",
          "The Kunspalast has got 3 collections: glass works, old masters -mainlay German - and modern paintings. Our problem was that there are too many not so important art works, and just some great paintings. This is not the first museum you should visit in D\u00fcsseldorf.",
          "I went to this museum one Sunday when everything was closed. I had planned to spend my last day in Germany shopping. Oops. This museum was open and I decided to go. What a pleasant surprise. Great collections of modern and classical art. If you can go by August of 2015,",

          "Stopped in to see the glass museum and was not disappointed. Nice history of glass from middle ages to modern sculptures. The rest of the museum was also worth seeing and was more than I expected from a small city like Dusseldorf.",
          "The museum was like a 3D maze with many dead-ends. There were more staffs than visitors and they told me don't go that way and go this way every time I stepped into some wrong place (The signposts are sparse and written only in German that I couldn't read.) One of them even",
          "Somehow we managed to see the glass exhibits for free and some of the modern pieces were interesting. However we did not feel like paying to see the other exhibits but the shhop was nice and had a good range of gifts.",
          "It's Split into 2 buildings and you pay at either entrance for both. One side has a pleasant cafe and houses temporary exhibitions usually and the other building usually has the permanent collection including a large glass collection",

          "If you are in D\u00fcsseldorf and you want to see a Museum showing classic paintings, you must go to the Kunstpalast. Although the statement may look preposterous, it is not easy to discover this fact. I love classic German painting and, when I arrived in D\u00fcsseldorf, I immediately",

          "I visited when there was a change in exhibitions - basically one wing closed. I watched the \"Alten Meister\" - bit too much for me. Maybe because I saw the George Grosz exhibit first - many drawings - nice overview. Then a smaller wing with modern art ... some weird pieces. A lot",
          "We arrived amid a jazz concert in front of the museum complex and enjoyed the music inside as well. The glass exhibit is quite magnificent. The museum has some Rubens as well as interesting 19th and 20th century art.",

          "Very disjointed with very officious attendants. I was asked to show my ticket 5 times and told that I could not carry my coat - hence visitors tying their coats around their waists. The girl at the ticket desk said the Cream Cheese was open but it was not. The glass is",
          "Depressing exterior hides a truly fantastic museum. Even with part of it closed for a new installation it was worth several hours. The Glass section alone was worth the modest admission. That area was amazing! If you are a fan of glass you must see it. Rest of the museum was",
          "I was in the area with time so I headed into this museum. There are some nice parts, particularly the glass museum. We rarely get a lot of glass in other museums. But overall I was not impressed. There are some nice works here but no extensive sampling of any period. I also",

          "We went on a rainy day in April and were the only two people in the entire museum. The glass collection was very nice, the other sections were just average. I have to comment on the obnoxious amount of security in each room. We were stopped three times and asked to see our",
          "I only went to see Gursky, but it rocked! The place is massive and can get crowded, but I'm glad I went. They really do present the pieces very well. I didn't check out the rest of the museum, but I really liked this part/exhibition.",
          "Very interesting museum with a variety of exhibitions - from wooden icons and statues of 11-12 century, amazing paintings of 19 century to the modern arts. They also have gorgeous exhibitin of glass, again from ancient ages till nowadays. Kunstpalast in Dusseldorf is worth",
          "While some of the 19th-century galleries, which I remembered to have major holdings of Dusseldorf-school landscape paintings, were closed, we were very impressed by this museum's extensive and significant collection of historical and contemporary glass, including both displays",

          "Apart from 2 Rembrandt paintings, Museum Kunst Palast does not have many work to show. It looks more like a gallery than a museum. Besides, half of it was closed for an event when we visited it, so we did not have the chance to see the whole of it.",
          "The museum was very interesting with many different styles and ages of paintings. The glass exhibition was very good and excellently displayed. Well worth an hour or two during your visit to Dusseldorf",
          "Visited it during the \"nights-of-the-museums\". This museum is north of Tonhalle and the NRW-forum. Of course, the night ambience and the massive attendance added to the overall impression, but is worth visiting any day time."

The district covers an area of 11.35 square kilometres and (as of December 2009) has about 75,000 inhabitants.\nDespite being one of D\u00fcsseldorf's smallest districts by area, Stadtbezirk 1 includes several distinct quarters: the city's Medieval Altstadt is known as an entertainment district with plenty of Altbier pubs and bars, while the adjacent Baroque-style Carlstadt has a very Bohemian character. Stadtmitte is the city's shopping and central business district, extending into the three Gr\u00fcnderzeit quarters of Pempelfort, Derendorf and Golzheim - the latter three also being popular as both business locations and residential areas. The entire district has a high density of institutions and enterprises associated with the arts and culture in general.\nThe district shares borders (clockwise from north) with D\u00fcsseldorf districts 5, 6, 2, 3 and - over the Rhine - District 4.\n\n\n== Subdivisions ==\nDistrict 1 is made up of six Stadtteile (city parts):\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\n\n=== Landmarks ===\nD\u00fcsseldorf Stock Exchange\nK\u00f6nigsallee\nKunstakademie\nMarktplatz\nSchlossturm\nSt. Lambertuskirche\nNew Synagogue\nDrei-Scheiben-Haus\nJohannes-Church\n\n\n=== Arts, Culture and Entertainment ===\nDeutsche Oper am Rhein\nD\u00fcsseldorfer Schauspielhaus\nFilmmuseum\nForum NRW\nHetjens Museum (German museum of ceramics)\nInstitut Fran\u00e7ais D\u00fcsseldorf\nKom(m)\u00f6dchen (Political cabaret)\nKunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen - K20 (Grabbeplatz) and K21 (St\u00e4ndehaus)\nKunsthalle D\u00fcsseldorf\nMarionettentheater\nMuseum Kunst Palast\nStadtmuseum\nTanzhaus NRW (theatre for dance)\nTonhalle D\u00fcsseldorf (concert hall for classical music, jazz, pop, cabaret)\n\n\n=== Shopping ===\nK\u00f6 Gallerie\nSchadow-Arkaden\nSevens K\u00f6nigsallee\n\n\n=== Parks and open spaces ===\nHofgarten\nK\u00f6nigsallee\nRheinpark\nRheinuferpromenade\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nAs the business center of D\u00fcsseldorf, District 1 is well served by numerous railway stations and highway.

          "I frankly do not understand some of the lower ratings of the K.I.T. The fact that someone thought of reconverting a disused tunnel to a museum is very nice of itself. The small museum provides an area for less known artists to present their work. Enter through the cafe, and go",
          "The idea, or at least the name, of a contemporary art museum in a 'tunnel' drew my curiosity, but a visit here proved to be a little disappointing. First, the size of the museum is, and feels, very small. The exhibition on display at the time of my visit was, sorry to say, not",

          "This is very small museum under the tunnel. But fact is its not actually a tunnel. You can not pass through it like other famous tunnels as you have seen in Antwerp or Hamburg. Basically its a V shaped basement which was hosting below average modern art. There was nothing that",
          "Go to drink a coffee or something like that, because it is quiet and the view to the river is very good. The wi-Fi was insufficient, so we didn't stay long. No need to pay to go down to the tunnel. I rate this collection poor",

          "OK, modern art is always gonna be contravesial, there was one or two interesting pieces, how ever on the whole I found it very week. It could be that I timed it badly and that when I visited the exhibition was not to my taste, however I found this very week. OK it is a lot",
          "Kunst im Tunnel is quite small. There were about 20 exhibits. Some of these are drawings. There's also a torso dressed up in a peculiar way, and gravestones with pictures on them. It's work by upcoming artists, and I think that chances of really liking a work from upcoming",

        "wiki": "The D\u00fcsseldorf's cartwheeler (Radschl\u00e4ger in German) is the oldest tradition of D\u00fcsseldorf and became one of their famous landmarks. The symbol of the cartwheel is found on many souvenirs and various naming D\u00fcsseldorf again. This tradition was honoured in 1954 by the erection of a fountain, called Cartwheeler's Fountain, in D\u00fcsseldorf's Burgplatz.\n\n\n== Origin of the legend and history ==\nThe origin of the custom cannot be pinned down to a single historic event, but several stories have appeared around it.\nThe best known version is the battle of Worringen. Adolf VIII, Count of Berg, defeated the Archbishop of Cologne in this battle in 1288. As a result of the victory, D\u00fcsseldorf received city rights. According to the story, the custom stems from the population and especially the children running for joy and making cartwheels on the streets .\nAnother narrative style is about a wedding procession, in which the wedding carriage's wheel broke. To ward off the impending disaster, a boy jumped into a coach, and held the wheel. Whether the wedding was that of Jan Wellem and Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici or to the wedding of the Margravine Jakobea of Baden with Johann Wilhelm of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg, is controversial. A further modification takes on these second wedding. The bride is supposed to have been very unhappy with her marriage, but the cartwheelers and their coach's skills would have made her laugh.\nLate 19th century and early 20th century, many travelers came to the city for major exhibitions -the forerunners of today's fairs. The children discovered that cartwheels was a lucrative source of income, as the incoming bourgeois paid them up to a penny for what they thought was a \"local and patriotic\" symbol.\nIn 1945, after the war-evacuated Jan-Wellem monument was brought back to the city, not only torches and fanfare accompanied it, but also cartwheeling boys.\n\n\n== Cartwheels in D\u00fcsseldorf's cityscape ==\nCartwheelers are found in several fountains in the city. The best known is Radschl\u00e4gerbrunnen (Cartwheeler Fountain) in the Burgplatz, created in 1954 by Alfred Zschorsch, with Hans M\u00fcller-Schl\u00f6sser's inscription \"Radschl\u00e4ger wolle mer blieve, wie jeck et de Minschen och drieve\" (\"We want to keep being cartwheelers, no matter how crazy the world might be\"). Even street maintenance hole covers and door knockers of Saint Lambertus Church, designed by Friedrich Becker, who also created the cartwheelers in front of the D\u00fcsseldorf's shopping mall Schadow-Arkaden.\nThe tradition is notably kept alive by the Alde D\u00fcsseldorf civil society of 1920, who conducted the first cartwheeler competition on 17 October 1937. Since 1971, it was held annually by boys and girls in June on the K\u00f6nigsallee, and since 2006 on the Rheinwerft below the old town and has become an integral part in the D\u00fcsseldorf event program. More than 500 boys and girls participate each year.\n\nIn 2001, the project Radschl\u00e4ger-Kunst (Cartwheeler-Art) started, consisting in the creation of over 100 cartwheeler sculptures by professional and amateur artists. The sculptures, which used Saint Lambertus Church door knockers as a starting model, are two meters high and wide and have a depth of 30 centimeters. They were distributed in the urban area and only a part was purchased at the end of the year from private individuals or companies.",

At the confluence of the Rhine and its tributary D\u00fcssel, the city lies in the centre of both the Rhine-Ruhr and the Rhineland Metropolitan Regions with the Cologne Bonn Region to its south and the Ruhr to its north. Most of the city lies on the right bank of the Rhine (as opposed to Cologne, whose city centre lies on the river's left bank). The city is the largest in the German Low Franconian dialect area (closely related to Dutch). \"Dorf\" meaning \"village\" in German, the \"-dorf\" suffix (English cognate: thorp) is unusual in the German-speaking area for a settlement of D\u00fcsseldorf's size.\nMercer's 2012 Quality of Living survey ranked D\u00fcsseldorf the sixth most livable city in the world. D\u00fcsseldorf Airport is Germany's third-busiest airport after those of Frankfurt and Munich, serving as the most important international airport for the inhabitants of the densely populated Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area. D\u00fcsseldorf is an international business and financial centre, renowned for its fashion and trade fairs, and is headquarters to one Fortune Global 500 and two DAX companies. Messe D\u00fcsseldorf organises nearly one fifth of premier trade shows. As second largest city of the Rhineland, D\u00fcsseldorf holds Rhenish Carnival celebrations every year in February/March, the D\u00fcsseldorf carnival celebrations being the third most popular in Germany after those held in Cologne and Mainz.There are 22 institutions of higher education in the city including the Heinrich-Heine-Universit\u00e4t D\u00fcsseldorf, the university of applied sciences (Hochschule D\u00fcsseldorf), the academy of arts (Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf) (Joseph Beuys, Emanuel Leutze, August Macke, Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, and Andreas Gursky), and the university of music (Robert-Schumann-Musikhochschule D\u00fcsseldorf). The city is also known for its pioneering influence on electronic/experimental music (Kraftwerk) and its Japanese community.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early development ===\nWhen the Roman Empire was strengthening its position throughout Europe, a few Germanic tribes clung on in marshy territory off the eastern banks of the Rhine. In the 7th and 8th centuries, the odd farming or fishing settlement could be found at the point where the small river D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine. It was from such settlements that the city of D\u00fcsseldorf grew.\n\nThe first written mention of D\u00fcsseldorf (then called Dusseldorp in the local Low Rhenish dialect) dates back to 1135. Under Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa the small town of Kaiserswerth to the north of D\u00fcsseldorf became a well-fortified outpost, where soldiers kept a watchful eye on every movement on the Rhine. Kaiserswerth eventually became a suburb of D\u00fcsseldorf in 1929. In 1186, D\u00fcsseldorf came under the rule of the Counts of Berg. 14 August 1288 is one of the most important dates in the history of D\u00fcsseldorf. On this day the sovereign Count Adolf VIII of Berg granted the village on the banks of the D\u00fcssel town privileges. Before this, a bloody struggle for power had taken place between the Archbishop of Cologne and the count of Berg, culminating in the Battle of Worringen.\n\nThe Archbishop of Cologne's forces were wiped out by the forces of the count of Berg who were supported by citizens and farmers of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf, paving the way for D\u00fcsseldorf's elevation to city status, which is commemorated today by a monument on the Burgplatz. The custom of turning cartwheels is credited to the children of D\u00fcsseldorf. There are variations of the origin of the cartwheeling children. Today the symbol (Der Radschl\u00e4ger) represents the story and every year the D\u00fcsseldorfers celebrate by having a cartwheeling contest. After this battle the relationship between the four cities deteriorated, because they were commercial rivals; it is often said that there is a kind of hostility between the citizens of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf. Today, it finds its expression mainly in a humorous form (especially during the Rhineland Karneval) and in sports.A market square sprang up on the banks of the Rhine and the square was protected by city walls on all four sides. In 1380, the dukes of Berg moved their seat to the town and D\u00fcsseldorf was made regional capital of the Duchy of Berg. During the following centuries several famous landmarks were built, including the Collegiate Church of St Lambertus. In 1609, the ducal line of the United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg died out, and after a virulent struggle over succession, J\u00fclich and Berg fell to the Wittelsbach Counts of Palatinate-Neuburg, who made D\u00fcsseldorf their main domicile, even after they inherited the Electorate of the Palatinate, in 1685, becoming now Prince-electors as Electors Palatine.Under the art-loving Johann Wilhelm II (r. 1690\u20131716), a vast art gallery with a huge selection of paintings and sculptures, were housed in the Stadtschloss (city castle). After his death, the city fell on hard times again, especially after Elector Charles Theodore inherited Bavaria and moved the electoral court to Munich. With him he took the art collection, which became part of what is now the Alte Pinakothek in Munich. Destruction and poverty struck D\u00fcsseldorf after the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon made Berg a Grand Duchy and D\u00fcsseldorf its capital. Johann Devaranne, a leader of Solingen's resistance to Napoleon's conscription decrees, was executed here in 1813. After Napoleon's defeat, the whole Rhineland including Berg was given to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815. The Rhine Province's parliament was established in D\u00fcsseldorf. By the mid-19th century, D\u00fcsseldorf enjoyed a revival thanks to the Industrial Revolution as the city boasted 100,000 inhabitants by 1882; the figure doubled in 1892.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nDuring World War I the Royal Naval Air Service (RNS) undertook the first Entente strategic bombing missions on 22 September 1914, when it bombed the Zeppelin bases in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\nIn 1920, D\u00fcsseldorf became the centre of the General Strike. On 15 April 1920, 45 delegates of the German Miners Union were murdered by the Freikorps.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nThe city was a target of strategic bombing during World War II, particularly during the RAF bombing campaign in 1943 when over 700 bombers were used in a single night. Raids continued late into the war. As part of the campaign against German oil facilities, the RAF raid of 20\u201321 February on the Rhenania Ossag refinery in the Reisholz district of the city halted oil production there. The Allied ground advance into Germany reached D\u00fcsseldorf in mid-April 1945. The United States 97th Infantry Division easily captured the city on 18 April 1945, after the local German Resistance group launched Aktion Rheinland.\n\n\n=== German Federal Republic ===\nIn 1946, D\u00fcsseldorf was made capital of the new federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The city's reconstruction proceeded at a frantic pace and the economic transformation guided D\u00fcsseldorf's economic growth.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Physical geography ===\n\nD\u00fcsseldorf lies at the centre of the Lower Rhine basin, where the delta of the D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine. The city lies on the east side of the Rhine, except District 4 (Oberkassel, Niederkassel, Heerdt and L\u00f6rick).\nAcross the Rhine, the city of Neuss stands on the delta of the Erft. D\u00fcsseldorf lies southwest of the Ruhr urban area, and in the middle of the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region.\nD\u00fcsseldorf is built entirely on alluvium, mud, sand, clay and occasionally gravel. The highest point in D\u00fcsseldorf is the top of Sandberg in the far eastern part of the city (Hubbelrath borough) at 165 metres (541 ft). The lowest point is at the far northern end in Wittlaer borough where the Schwarzbach enters the Rhine, with an average elevation of 28 metres (92 ft).\n\n\n=== Adjacent cities and districts ===\nThe following districts and cities border D\u00fcsseldorf (clockwise starting from the north): the City of Duisburg, the District of Mettmann (Ratingen, Mettmann, Erkrath, Hilden, Langenfeld, and Monheim), and the District of Neuss (Dormagen, Neuss, and Meerbusch).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe city has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb, mild in relation to East Germany). Like the rest of the lower Rhineland, D\u00fcsseldorf experiences moderate winters with little snowfall and mild to warm summers.

Heinrich Heine, whose 200th birthday was celebrated in 1997 and who originally had a proposed memorial in the city dedicated to him; Clara and Robert Schumann; and as Felix Mendelssohn, are the most prominent artists related to the city, which is home to a distinguished Academy of Fine Arts.\nThe D\u00fcsseldorf cultural scene comprises traditional and avant-garde, classical and glamorous. The world-famous state art collection of North Rhine-Westphalia, the highly acclaimed Deutsche Oper am Rhein (opera), and the D\u00fcsseldorfer Schauspielhaus (theatre), artistic home of Gustaf Gr\u00fcndgens, are major elements of D\u00fcsseldorf's reputation as a centre of the fine arts.\n\n\n=== Beer ===\nD\u00fcsseldorf is well known for its Altbier, a hoppy beer which translates as old [style] beer, a reference to the pre-lager brewing method of using a warm top-fermenting yeast like British pale ales. Over time the Alt yeast adjusted to lower temperatures, and the Alt brewers would store or lager the beer after fermentation, leading to a cleaner, crisper beer. The name \"altbier\" first appeared in the 19th century to differentiate the beers of D\u00fcsseldorf from the new pale lager that was gaining a hold on Germany.Brewers in D\u00fcsseldorf used the pale malts that were used for the modern pale lagers, but retained the old (\"alt\") method of using warm fermenting yeasts. The first brewery to use the name Alt was Schumacher which opened in 1838. The founder, Mathias Schumacher, allowed the beer to mature in cool conditions in wooden casks for longer than normal, and laid the foundation for the modern alt \u2013 amber coloured and lagered. The result is a pale beer that has some of the lean dryness of a lager but with fruity notes as well.There are five pub-breweries in D\u00fcsseldorf which brew Altbier on the premises: F\u00fcchschen, Schumacher, Schl\u00fcssel, Uerige and Brauerei K\u00fcrzer. Four of the five are in the historic centre of D\u00fcsseldorf (Altstadt); the other (Schumacher), between the Altstadt and D\u00fcsseldorf Central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), also maintains an establishment in the Altstadt, Im Goldenen Kessel, across the street from Schl\u00fcssel.\nEach (except Brauerei K\u00fcrzer) produces a special, secret, seasonal \"Sticke\" version in small quantities, though the names vary: Schl\u00fcssel spells it \"Stike\", without the \"c\", while Schumacher calls its special beer \"Latzenbier\", meaning \"slat beer\", possibly because the kegs from which it was poured had been stored on raised shelves. F\u00fcchschen's seasonal is its Weihnachtsbier (Christmas beer), available in bottles starting mid-November, and served in the brewpub on Christmas Eve.\n\n\n=== Music and nightlife ===\n\nSince the 1950s the \"Kom(m)\u00f6dchen\" has been one of the most prominent political cabarets of Germany. The city's most famous contribution to the culture of modern popular music is beyond doubt the influential avant-garde electronic band Kraftwerk. Formed by a few D\u00fcsseldorf-born musicians, Kraftwerk is internationally known as the most significant band in the history of post-war German music and as pioneers in electronic music. Other influential musical groups originating from D\u00fcsseldorf include Neu!, formed in 1971 by Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother, after their split from Kraftwerk, and La D\u00fcsseldorf, also formed by Dinger in 1976 shortly after Neu! disbanded. Both groups had a significant influence on a variety of subsequent rock, post-punk, and electronic music artists.Internationally known power metal band Warlock was formed in D\u00fcsseldorf in 1982. Its frontwoman, Doro Pesch, had a successful solo career in Europe and Asia since Warlock ended. The punk band Die Toten Hosen, which is famous around the world, also the most popular singers in Germany Westernhagen and Heino come from D\u00fcsseldorf. The electronic act D.A.F. was formed in the city in 1978, as well as the electronic/industrial pioneers Die Krupps in 1980. Another famous formation is Fehlfarben. Founded in the late 1970s by Peter Hein, Frank Fenstermacher, Kurt Dahlke and Michael Kemner.\nD\u00fcsseldorf appears in several songs, including D\u00fcsseldorf by the British indie band Teleman and W\u00e4rst du doch in D\u00fcsseldorf geblieben by Danish singer Dorthe Kollo.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nD\u00fcsseldorf, Germany is the fashion capital of Germany as it is a major cultural center for the art and fashion scenes. The fashionable clothes trend took root in this city before 1949. 1949 is the date of the first fashion show staged in D\u00fcsseldorf. Fashion trends have occurred as access to more elegant clothing for the general public has been a part of the culture for almost a century. Two times a year an event called the, \u201cVoices of Fashion,\u201d occurs and attracts many people to visit D\u00fcsseldorf to find the latest fashion items. There are famous designers that have made a name for themselves in D\u00fcsseldorf as well. Designers Sabine Schumacher, Peter O. Mahler, and Renate Harvan all design in D\u00fcsseldorf.

Karneval ends on Aschermittwoch (Ash Wednesday).\n\n\n=== Cartwheeler of D\u00fcsseldorf ===\n\nThe D\u00fcsseldorfer Radschl\u00e4ger (Boy who does Cartwheels) is said to be the city's oldest tradition. The symbol of the cartwheeler can be found on many souvenirs and various things in D\u00fcsseldorf have the cartwheelers to thank for their names. This tradition was honoured in 1954 by the erection of a fountain, called Cartwheeler's Fountain, on the Burgplatz in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n==== Legends of its origin and history ====\nThe tradition cannot be linked to one specific historical event, instead, there are several stories surrounding the beginnings of the D\u00fcsseldorf Cartwheelers. Probably the most well known version is Battle of Worringen. In the battle of 1288 Count Adolf devastatingly defeated the Archbishop of Cologne. As a consequence of this victory, D\u00fcsseldorf obtained Town privileges. The inhabitants, especially the children ran joyfully on the streets and performed cartwheels.\nAnother story talks about a wedding procession during which one of the wheels of the wedding carriage broke. In order to fend off the threat of bad luck, a boy supposedly jumped to the carriage, took hold of the wheel and thus became a living part of the wheel. Whether the story is about the marriage of Jan Wellem and Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici or the wedding of Margravine Jakobea of Baden and Johann Wilhelm is debatable.\nAnother story gives an account of this wedding between Margrave Jacobe von Baden and Johann Wilhelm, in 1585. According to legend she felt miserable about her marriage, but the cartwheelers who displayed their skills next to her carriage were able to make her smile. Numerous travelers were attracted to the city by great exhibitions \u2013 the forerunner of today's fairs \u2013 between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. During this time the children who did the cart wheeling found out that it was a profitable source of income. The bourgeoisie accepted this in good humour as a symbolic act of local patriotism. In the beginning the lads shouted \"f\u00f6r eene Penning schlage ich das Rad\u201c (cartwheel for a penny). The Jan Wellem monument returned to D\u00fcsseldorf at the end of the Second World War. The procession was accompanied by torches, fanfares and the cartwheeling boys.\n\n\n===== Cartwheelers in the cityscape =====\nCartwheelers can be found by several fountains within the city and near many small landmarks. The most famous is Cartwheeler's Fountain in Burgplatz with an inscription of a quote by Hans M\u00fcller-Schl\u00f6sser: \"Radschl\u00e4ger wolle mer blieve, wie jeck et de Minschen och drieve\u201c (We will always remain cartwheelers, however crazy it drives people.) The fountain was designed by Alfred Zschorsch in 1954 and donated by the  Heimatverein D\u00fcsseldorfer Jonges, which is a club devoted to the maintenance of local and regional traditions. There are other cartwheelers that decorate storm drains and the door knocker on the Church of Lambertus, which was designed by Friedrich Becker. He created the cartwheeler in front of the Schadow Arcades.This tradition has been kept alive by the Alde D\u00fcsseldorfer B\u00fcrgergesellschaft von 1920 e. V., a society founded in 1920, who organized the first cartwheeler competition on 17 October 1937. Since 1971 this event has been held annually in cooperation with the Stadtsparkasse (a local bank), but formerly took place in the K\u00f6nigsallee. Since 2006 it has taken place on the Rheinwerft, near the old part of town. This is a fixed date in the city\u2019s calendar of events. About 500 boys regularly participate in this event and since 1971 girls have also taken part. In 2001 the art project Radschl\u00e4ger-Kunst (Cartwheeler Art) was called into life, in which over 100 cartwheeler sculptures have been designed by various artists. The door knocker on the Church of Lambertus functioned as a model for the sculptures that are 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) high, 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) wide and 30 cm (12 in) deep. They were positioned around the city centre. Some of the sculptures have been auctioned off to companies and private owners.\n\n\n=== Christmas market ===\nEvery Christmas, the city of D\u00fcsseldorf uses the city centre to host one of the largest Christmas gatherings in Germany. The Christmas festival occurs every year from 17 November until 23 December. This Christmas fest brings D\u00fcsseldorf a large portion of tourism every year as many people from nearby areas come to the city to drink mulled wine and hot chocolate and watch craftsman blow glass and create art. The event contains many small wooden buildings all clustered in the middle of the city for all the citizens to enjoy.

At the confluence of the Rhine and its tributary D\u00fcssel, the city lies in the centre of both the Rhine-Ruhr and the Rhineland Metropolitan Regions with the Cologne Bonn Region to its south and the Ruhr to its north. Most of the city lies on the right bank of the Rhine (as opposed to Cologne, whose city centre lies on the river's left bank). The city is the largest in the German Low Franconian dialect area (closely related to Dutch). \"Dorf\" meaning \"village\" in German, the \"-dorf\" suffix (English cognate: thorp) is unusual in the German-speaking area for a settlement of D\u00fcsseldorf's size.\nMercer's 2012 Quality of Living survey ranked D\u00fcsseldorf the sixth most livable city in the world. D\u00fcsseldorf Airport is Germany's third-busiest airport after those of Frankfurt and Munich, serving as the most important international airport for the inhabitants of the densely populated Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area. D\u00fcsseldorf is an international business and financial centre, renowned for its fashion and trade fairs, and is headquarters to one Fortune Global 500 and two DAX companies. Messe D\u00fcsseldorf organises nearly one fifth of premier trade shows. As second largest city of the Rhineland, D\u00fcsseldorf holds Rhenish Carnival celebrations every year in February/March, the D\u00fcsseldorf carnival celebrations being the third most popular in Germany after those held in Cologne and Mainz.There are 22 institutions of higher education in the city including the Heinrich-Heine-Universit\u00e4t D\u00fcsseldorf, the university of applied sciences (Hochschule D\u00fcsseldorf), the academy of arts (Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf) (Joseph Beuys, Emanuel Leutze, August Macke, Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, and Andreas Gursky), and the university of music (Robert-Schumann-Musikhochschule D\u00fcsseldorf). The city is also known for its pioneering influence on electronic/experimental music (Kraftwerk) and its Japanese community.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early development ===\nWhen the Roman Empire was strengthening its position throughout Europe, a few Germanic tribes clung on in marshy territory off the eastern banks of the Rhine. In the 7th and 8th centuries, the odd farming or fishing settlement could be found at the point where the small river D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine. It was from such settlements that the city of D\u00fcsseldorf grew.\n\nThe first written mention of D\u00fcsseldorf (then called Dusseldorp in the local Low Rhenish dialect) dates back to 1135. Under Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa the small town of Kaiserswerth to the north of D\u00fcsseldorf became a well-fortified outpost, where soldiers kept a watchful eye on every movement on the Rhine. Kaiserswerth eventually became a suburb of D\u00fcsseldorf in 1929. In 1186, D\u00fcsseldorf came under the rule of the Counts of Berg. 14 August 1288 is one of the most important dates in the history of D\u00fcsseldorf. On this day the sovereign Count Adolf VIII of Berg granted the village on the banks of the D\u00fcssel town privileges. Before this, a bloody struggle for power had taken place between the Archbishop of Cologne and the count of Berg, culminating in the Battle of Worringen.\n\nThe Archbishop of Cologne's forces were wiped out by the forces of the count of Berg who were supported by citizens and farmers of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf, paving the way for D\u00fcsseldorf's elevation to city status, which is commemorated today by a monument on the Burgplatz. The custom of turning cartwheels is credited to the children of D\u00fcsseldorf. There are variations of the origin of the cartwheeling children. Today the symbol (Der Radschl\u00e4ger) represents the story and every year the D\u00fcsseldorfers celebrate by having a cartwheeling contest. After this battle the relationship between the four cities deteriorated, because they were commercial rivals; it is often said that there is a kind of hostility between the citizens of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf. Today, it finds its expression mainly in a humorous form (especially during the Rhineland Karneval) and in sports.A market square sprang up on the banks of the Rhine and the square was protected by city walls on all four sides. In 1380, the dukes of Berg moved their seat to the town and D\u00fcsseldorf was made regional capital of the Duchy of Berg. During the following centuries several famous landmarks were built, including the Collegiate Church of St Lambertus. In 1609, the ducal line of the United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg died out, and after a virulent struggle over succession, J\u00fclich and Berg fell to the Wittelsbach Counts of Palatinate-Neuburg, who made D\u00fcsseldorf their main domicile, even after they inherited the Electorate of the Palatinate, in 1685, becoming now Prince-electors as Electors Palatine.Under the art-loving Johann Wilhelm II (r. 1690\u20131716), a vast art gallery with a huge selection of paintings and sculptures, were housed in the Stadtschloss (city castle). After his death, the city fell on hard times again, especially after Elector Charles Theodore inherited Bavaria and moved the electoral court to Munich. With him he took the art collection, which became part of what is now the Alte Pinakothek in Munich. Destruction and poverty struck D\u00fcsseldorf after the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon made Berg a Grand Duchy and D\u00fcsseldorf its capital. Johann Devaranne, a leader of Solingen's resistance to Napoleon's conscription decrees, was executed here in 1813. After Napoleon's defeat, the whole Rhineland including Berg was given to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815. The Rhine Province's parliament was established in D\u00fcsseldorf. By the mid-19th century, D\u00fcsseldorf enjoyed a revival thanks to the Industrial Revolution as the city boasted 100,000 inhabitants by 1882; the figure doubled in 1892.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nDuring World War I the Royal Naval Air Service (RNS) undertook the first Entente strategic bombing missions on 22 September 1914, when it bombed the Zeppelin bases in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\nIn 1920, D\u00fcsseldorf became the centre of the General Strike. On 15 April 1920, 45 delegates of the German Miners Union were murdered by the Freikorps.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nThe city was a target of strategic bombing during World War II, particularly during the RAF bombing campaign in 1943 when over 700 bombers were used in a single night. Raids continued late into the war. As part of the campaign against German oil facilities, the RAF raid of 20\u201321 February on the Rhenania Ossag refinery in the Reisholz district of the city halted oil production there. The Allied ground advance into Germany reached D\u00fcsseldorf in mid-April 1945. The United States 97th Infantry Division easily captured the city on 18 April 1945, after the local German Resistance group launched Aktion Rheinland.\n\n\n=== German Federal Republic ===\nIn 1946, D\u00fcsseldorf was made capital of the new federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The city's reconstruction proceeded at a frantic pace and the economic transformation guided D\u00fcsseldorf's economic growth.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Physical geography ===\n\nD\u00fcsseldorf lies at the centre of the Lower Rhine basin, where the delta of the D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine.

Over time the Alt yeast adjusted to lower temperatures, and the Alt brewers would store or lager the beer after fermentation, leading to a cleaner, crisper beer. The name \"altbier\" first appeared in the 19th century to differentiate the beers of D\u00fcsseldorf from the new pale lager that was gaining a hold on Germany.Brewers in D\u00fcsseldorf used the pale malts that were used for the modern pale lagers, but retained the old (\"alt\") method of using warm fermenting yeasts. The first brewery to use the name Alt was Schumacher which opened in 1838. The founder, Mathias Schumacher, allowed the beer to mature in cool conditions in wooden casks for longer than normal, and laid the foundation for the modern alt \u2013 amber coloured and lagered. The result is a pale beer that has some of the lean dryness of a lager but with fruity notes as well.There are five pub-breweries in D\u00fcsseldorf which brew Altbier on the premises: F\u00fcchschen, Schumacher, Schl\u00fcssel, Uerige and Brauerei K\u00fcrzer. Four of the five are in the historic centre of D\u00fcsseldorf (Altstadt); the other (Schumacher), between the Altstadt and D\u00fcsseldorf Central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), also maintains an establishment in the Altstadt, Im Goldenen Kessel, across the street from Schl\u00fcssel.\nEach (except Brauerei K\u00fcrzer) produces a special, secret, seasonal \"Sticke\" version in small quantities, though the names vary: Schl\u00fcssel spells it \"Stike\", without the \"c\", while Schumacher calls its special beer \"Latzenbier\", meaning \"slat beer\", possibly because the kegs from which it was poured had been stored on raised shelves. F\u00fcchschen's seasonal is its Weihnachtsbier (Christmas beer), available in bottles starting mid-November, and served in the brewpub on Christmas Eve.\n\n\n=== Music and nightlife ===\n\nSince the 1950s the \"Kom(m)\u00f6dchen\" has been one of the most prominent political cabarets of Germany. The city's most famous contribution to the culture of modern popular music is beyond doubt the influential avant-garde electronic band Kraftwerk. Formed by a few D\u00fcsseldorf-born musicians, Kraftwerk is internationally known as the most significant band in the history of post-war German music and as pioneers in electronic music. Other influential musical groups originating from D\u00fcsseldorf include Neu!, formed in 1971 by Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother, after their split from Kraftwerk, and La D\u00fcsseldorf, also formed by Dinger in 1976 shortly after Neu! disbanded. Both groups had a significant influence on a variety of subsequent rock, post-punk, and electronic music artists.Internationally known power metal band Warlock was formed in D\u00fcsseldorf in 1982. Its frontwoman, Doro Pesch, had a successful solo career in Europe and Asia since Warlock ended. The punk band Die Toten Hosen, which is famous around the world, also the most popular singers in Germany Westernhagen and Heino come from D\u00fcsseldorf. The electronic act D.A.F. was formed in the city in 1978, as well as the electronic/industrial pioneers Die Krupps in 1980. Another famous formation is Fehlfarben. Founded in the late 1970s by Peter Hein, Frank Fenstermacher, Kurt Dahlke and Michael Kemner.\nD\u00fcsseldorf appears in several songs, including D\u00fcsseldorf by the British indie band Teleman and W\u00e4rst du doch in D\u00fcsseldorf geblieben by Danish singer Dorthe Kollo.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nD\u00fcsseldorf, Germany is the fashion capital of Germany as it is a major cultural center for the art and fashion scenes. The fashionable clothes trend took root in this city before 1949. 1949 is the date of the first fashion show staged in D\u00fcsseldorf. Fashion trends have occurred as access to more elegant clothing for the general public has been a part of the culture for almost a century. Two times a year an event called the, \u201cVoices of Fashion,\u201d occurs and attracts many people to visit D\u00fcsseldorf to find the latest fashion items. There are famous designers that have made a name for themselves in D\u00fcsseldorf as well. Designers Sabine Schumacher, Peter O. Mahler, and Renate Harvan all design in D\u00fcsseldorf.

Karneval ends on Aschermittwoch (Ash Wednesday).\n\n\n=== Cartwheeler of D\u00fcsseldorf ===\n\nThe D\u00fcsseldorfer Radschl\u00e4ger (Boy who does Cartwheels) is said to be the city's oldest tradition. The symbol of the cartwheeler can be found on many souvenirs and various things in D\u00fcsseldorf have the cartwheelers to thank for their names. This tradition was honoured in 1954 by the erection of a fountain, called Cartwheeler's Fountain, on the Burgplatz in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n==== Legends of its origin and history ====\nThe tradition cannot be linked to one specific historical event, instead, there are several stories surrounding the beginnings of the D\u00fcsseldorf Cartwheelers. Probably the most well known version is Battle of Worringen. In the battle of 1288 Count Adolf devastatingly defeated the Archbishop of Cologne. As a consequence of this victory, D\u00fcsseldorf obtained Town privileges. The inhabitants, especially the children ran joyfully on the streets and performed cartwheels.\nAnother story talks about a wedding procession during which one of the wheels of the wedding carriage broke. In order to fend off the threat of bad luck, a boy supposedly jumped to the carriage, took hold of the wheel and thus became a living part of the wheel. Whether the story is about the marriage of Jan Wellem and Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici or the wedding of Margravine Jakobea of Baden and Johann Wilhelm is debatable.\nAnother story gives an account of this wedding between Margrave Jacobe von Baden and Johann Wilhelm, in 1585. According to legend she felt miserable about her marriage, but the cartwheelers who displayed their skills next to her carriage were able to make her smile. Numerous travelers were attracted to the city by great exhibitions \u2013 the forerunner of today's fairs \u2013 between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. During this time the children who did the cart wheeling found out that it was a profitable source of income. The bourgeoisie accepted this in good humour as a symbolic act of local patriotism. In the beginning the lads shouted \"f\u00f6r eene Penning schlage ich das Rad\u201c (cartwheel for a penny). The Jan Wellem monument returned to D\u00fcsseldorf at the end of the Second World War. The procession was accompanied by torches, fanfares and the cartwheeling boys.\n\n\n===== Cartwheelers in the cityscape =====\nCartwheelers can be found by several fountains within the city and near many small landmarks. The most famous is Cartwheeler's Fountain in Burgplatz with an inscription of a quote by Hans M\u00fcller-Schl\u00f6sser: \"Radschl\u00e4ger wolle mer blieve, wie jeck et de Minschen och drieve\u201c (We will always remain cartwheelers, however crazy it drives people.) The fountain was designed by Alfred Zschorsch in 1954 and donated by the  Heimatverein D\u00fcsseldorfer Jonges, which is a club devoted to the maintenance of local and regional traditions. There are other cartwheelers that decorate storm drains and the door knocker on the Church of Lambertus, which was designed by Friedrich Becker. He created the cartwheeler in front of the Schadow Arcades.This tradition has been kept alive by the Alde D\u00fcsseldorfer B\u00fcrgergesellschaft von 1920 e. V., a society founded in 1920, who organized the first cartwheeler competition on 17 October 1937. Since 1971 this event has been held annually in cooperation with the Stadtsparkasse (a local bank), but formerly took place in the K\u00f6nigsallee. Since 2006 it has taken place on the Rheinwerft, near the old part of town. This is a fixed date in the city\u2019s calendar of events. About 500 boys regularly participate in this event and since 1971 girls have also taken part. In 2001 the art project Radschl\u00e4ger-Kunst (Cartwheeler Art) was called into life, in which over 100 cartwheeler sculptures have been designed by various artists. The door knocker on the Church of Lambertus functioned as a model for the sculptures that are 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) high, 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) wide and 30 cm (12 in) deep. They were positioned around the city centre. Some of the sculptures have been auctioned off to companies and private owners.\n\n\n=== Christmas market ===\nEvery Christmas, the city of D\u00fcsseldorf uses the city centre to host one of the largest Christmas gatherings in Germany. The Christmas festival occurs every year from 17 November until 23 December. This Christmas fest brings D\u00fcsseldorf a large portion of tourism every year as many people from nearby areas come to the city to drink mulled wine and hot chocolate and watch craftsman blow glass and create art. The event contains many small wooden buildings all clustered in the middle of the city for all the citizens to enjoy. The event, to many visitors, has an old European feel, but is very lively.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nTraditional meals in the region are Rheinischer Sauerbraten (a beef roast and sometimes horse marinated for a few days in vinegar and spices served with gravy and raisins) and Heaven and Earth (Himmel und \u00c4d; black pudding with stewed apples mixed with mashed potatoes). In winter the people like to eat Muscheln Rheinischer Art (Rhenish-style mussels) as well as Reibekuchen (fried potato pancake served with apple sauce). Also a special meal: D\u00fcsseldorfer Senfrostbraten (Steaks roasted with D\u00fcsseldorf mustard on top).\nD\u00fcsseldorf is known for its strong Dijon-like mustard served in a traditional pot called \"Mostertp\u00f6ttche\", which was eternalised in a still life by Vincent van Gogh in 1884.The Rhine Metropolis is one of the most diverse areas in terms of culinary diversity.

        "wiki": "Golzheim, a borough of D\u00fcsseldorf in District 1 on the Rhine, just north of the city center, is primarily a business and hotel district, but retains some of the old stately villas.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe oldest parts of D\u00fcsseldorf are to be found in Golzheim and Stockum, but the Golzheim area was not so built-up that it could not accommodate the large international Trade Fair of 1902, and thus was established as the primary D\u00fcsseldorf exhibition site. It hosted the international national Health Fair of 1926 and the huge cultural NSDAP Exhibition of 1937. The waterfront on the Rhine, the Rheinpark Golzheim, owes its shape to these exhibitions.\nStarted in 1947, the annual D\u00fcsseldorf Trade Fair was held in Golzheim in the Ehrenhof complex, until the new exhibition grounds were built next to the airport in 1971.\nMany of the apartments, surrounding the area of Kaiserswerther Stra\u00dfe and Uerdinger Stra\u00dfe, were used as holiday apartments for members of the German Armed Forces in the 1930s.  From the air, gun emplacements can still be seen on top of these apartments and these were used to defend D\u00fcsseldorf during World War II.\nSince 1958 Golzheim is the place of the New Synagogue of D\u00fcsseldorf, which is the religious center for about 7.500 members of the local Jewish community, the third largest in Germany.\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\nGolzheim is one of the most prestigious office addresses in the city.  The tallest building is the Sky Office at 22 stories which was completed in 2006.  On the Ehrenhof are the NRW-Forum Kultur und Wirtschaft (North-Rhine Westphalia Forum for Culture and Trade),  and the art museum (Museum Kunst Palast).  The Tonhalle D\u00fcsseldorf (concert hall), located next to Oberkassel bridge on the Rhine, used to be a planetarium.  It and the Rheinpark Golzheim are important places for events.\n\nThe land for the park was reclaimed from an old harbor basin in 1900 in preparation for the 1902 Exhibition, and was used for exhibition and trade fair purposes until 1926.  After the international Health Fair of 1926, which had 7.5 million visitors, the area was turned into a park. Originally called  \"Kaiser-Wilhelm-Park\",  the Rheinpark Golzheim is not a classical park, but is more of a greenbelt, 24 hectares, between Cecilienallee and the Rhine, from the Oberkassel bridge to the Theodor Heuss bridge, with arranged copses of trees and plenty of open lawn for sunbathing and amateur volleyball games. The Circus Roncalli is located year-round in the park, and in the summer a local brewery sponsors an open-air cinema.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nGolzheim has an area of 2.64 km2, 10,248 inhabitants and therefore a density of 3,882 inhabitants/km2. Golzheim borders on the Rhine to the west, on Pempelfort to the south, on Kaiserswerth to the north, and on Derendorf to the east.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20061023164155/http://www.duesseldorf.de/bv/01/stadtteile/golzheim.shtml\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20070304201906/http://www.duesseldorf.de/bv/01/infos/historie.shtml\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20040919055933/http://www.duesseldorf-today.rp-online.de/cityguide/stadtrundgang/tour8/tour803.shtml\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20070304201434/http://www.duesseldorf.de/bv/01/infos/daten.shtml\nhttp://www.nrw-forum.de/\nWebsites from D\u00fcsseldorf Golzheim on Duesselgo - an search engine and portal for the region with an English range",

        "wiki": "D\u00fcsseldorf (often Dusseldorf in English sources; UK: , US: , German: [\u02c8d\u028fsl\u0329d\u0254\u0281f] (listen);  Low Franconian and Ripuarian: D\u00fcsseld\u00f6rp ([\u02c8d\u028fsl\u0329d\u0153\u0250\u032fp]); archaic Dutch: Dusseldorp) is the capital and second-largest city of the most populous German state of North Rhine-Westphalia after Cologne, and the seventh-largest city in Germany, with a population of 617,280. At the confluence of the Rhine and its tributary D\u00fcssel, the city lies in the centre of both the Rhine-Ruhr and the Rhineland Metropolitan Regions with the Cologne Bonn Region to its south and the Ruhr to its north. Most of the city lies on the right bank of the Rhine (as opposed to Cologne, whose city centre lies on the river's left bank). The city is the largest in the German Low Franconian dialect area (closely related to Dutch). \"Dorf\" meaning \"village\" in German, the \"-dorf\" suffix (English cognate: thorp) is unusual in the German-speaking area for a settlement of D\u00fcsseldorf's size.\nMercer's 2012 Quality of Living survey ranked D\u00fcsseldorf the sixth most livable city in the world. D\u00fcsseldorf Airport is Germany's third-busiest airport after those of Frankfurt and Munich, serving as the most important international airport for the inhabitants of the densely populated Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area. D\u00fcsseldorf is an international business and financial centre, renowned for its fashion and trade fairs, and is headquarters to one Fortune Global 500 and two DAX companies. Messe D\u00fcsseldorf organises nearly one fifth of premier trade shows. As second largest city of the Rhineland, D\u00fcsseldorf holds Rhenish Carnival celebrations every year in February/March, the D\u00fcsseldorf carnival celebrations being the third most popular in Germany after those held in Cologne and Mainz.There are 22 institutions of higher education in the city including the Heinrich-Heine-Universit\u00e4t D\u00fcsseldorf, the university of applied sciences (Hochschule D\u00fcsseldorf), the academy of arts (Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf) (Joseph Beuys, Emanuel Leutze, August Macke, Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, and Andreas Gursky), and the university of music (Robert-Schumann-Musikhochschule D\u00fcsseldorf). The city is also known for its pioneering influence on electronic/experimental music (Kraftwerk) and its Japanese community.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early development ===\nWhen the Roman Empire was strengthening its position throughout Europe, a few Germanic tribes clung on in marshy territory off the eastern banks of the Rhine. In the 7th and 8th centuries, the odd farming or fishing settlement could be found at the point where the small river D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine. It was from such settlements that the city of D\u00fcsseldorf grew.\n\nThe first written mention of D\u00fcsseldorf (then called Dusseldorp in the local Low Rhenish dialect) dates back to 1135. Under Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa the small town of Kaiserswerth to the north of D\u00fcsseldorf became a well-fortified outpost, where soldiers kept a watchful eye on every movement on the Rhine. Kaiserswerth eventually became a suburb of D\u00fcsseldorf in 1929. In 1186, D\u00fcsseldorf came under the rule of the Counts of Berg. 14 August 1288 is one of the most important dates in the history of D\u00fcsseldorf. On this day the sovereign Count Adolf VIII of Berg granted the village on the banks of the D\u00fcssel town privileges. Before this, a bloody struggle for power had taken place between the Archbishop of Cologne and the count of Berg, culminating in the Battle of Worringen.\n\nThe Archbishop of Cologne's forces were wiped out by the forces of the count of Berg who were supported by citizens and farmers of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf, paving the way for D\u00fcsseldorf's elevation to city status, which is commemorated today by a monument on the Burgplatz. The custom of turning cartwheels is credited to the children of D\u00fcsseldorf. There are variations of the origin of the cartwheeling children. Today the symbol (Der Radschl\u00e4ger) represents the story and every year the D\u00fcsseldorfers celebrate by having a cartwheeling contest. After this battle the relationship between the four cities deteriorated, because they were commercial rivals; it is often said that there is a kind of hostility between the citizens of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf. Today, it finds its expression mainly in a humorous form (especially during the Rhineland Karneval) and in sports.A market square sprang up on the banks of the Rhine and the square was protected by city walls on all four sides. In 1380, the dukes of Berg moved their seat to the town and D\u00fcsseldorf was made regional capital of the Duchy of Berg. During the following centuries several famous landmarks were built, including the Collegiate Church of St Lambertus. In 1609, the ducal line of the United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg died out, and after a virulent struggle over succession, J\u00fclich and Berg fell to the Wittelsbach Counts of Palatinate-Neuburg, who made D\u00fcsseldorf their main domicile, even after they inherited the Electorate of the Palatinate, in 1685, becoming now Prince-electors as Electors Palatine.Under the art-loving Johann Wilhelm II (r. 1690\u20131716), a vast art gallery with a huge selection of paintings and sculptures, were housed in the Stadtschloss (city castle). After his death, the city fell on hard times again, especially after Elector Charles Theodore inherited Bavaria and moved the electoral court to Munich. With him he took the art collection, which became part of what is now the Alte Pinakothek in Munich. Destruction and poverty struck D\u00fcsseldorf after the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon made Berg a Grand Duchy and D\u00fcsseldorf its capital. Johann Devaranne, a leader of Solingen's resistance to Napoleon's conscription decrees, was executed here in 1813. After Napoleon's defeat, the whole Rhineland including Berg was given to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815. The Rhine Province's parliament was established in D\u00fcsseldorf. By the mid-19th century, D\u00fcsseldorf enjoyed a revival thanks to the Industrial Revolution as the city boasted 100,000 inhabitants by 1882; the figure doubled in 1892.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nDuring World War I the Royal Naval Air Service (RNS) undertook the first Entente strategic bombing missions on 22 September 1914, when it bombed the Zeppelin bases in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\nIn 1920, D\u00fcsseldorf became the centre of the General Strike. On 15 April 1920, 45 delegates of the German Miners Union were murdered by the Freikorps.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nThe city was a target of strategic bombing during World War II, particularly during the RAF bombing campaign in 1943 when over 700 bombers were used in a single night. Raids continued late into the war. As part of the campaign against German oil facilities, the RAF raid of 20\u201321 February on the Rhenania Ossag refinery in the Reisholz district of the city halted oil production there. The Allied ground advance into Germany reached D\u00fcsseldorf in mid-April 1945. The United States 97th Infantry Division easily captured the city on 18 April 1945, after the local German Resistance group launched Aktion Rheinland.\n\n\n=== German Federal Republic ===\nIn 1946, D\u00fcsseldorf was made capital of the new federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The city's reconstruction proceeded at a frantic pace and the economic transformation guided D\u00fcsseldorf's economic growth.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Physical geography ===\n\nD\u00fcsseldorf lies at the centre of the Lower Rhine basin, where the delta of the D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine. The city lies on the east side of the Rhine, except District 4 (Oberkassel, Niederkassel, Heerdt and L\u00f6rick).\nAcross the Rhine, the city of Neuss stands on the delta of the Erft. D\u00fcsseldorf lies southwest of the Ruhr urban area, and in the middle of the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region.\nD\u00fcsseldorf is built entirely on alluvium, mud, sand, clay and occasionally gravel. The highest point in D\u00fcsseldorf is the top of Sandberg in the far eastern part of the city (Hubbelrath borough) at 165 metres (541 ft). The lowest point is at the far northern end in Wittlaer borough where the Schwarzbach enters the Rhine, with an average elevation of 28 metres (92 ft).\n\n\n=== Adjacent cities and districts ===\nThe following districts and cities border D\u00fcsseldorf (clockwise starting from the north): the City of Duisburg, the District of Mettmann (Ratingen, Mettmann, Erkrath, Hilden, Langenfeld, and Monheim), and the District of Neuss (Dormagen, Neuss, and Meerbusch).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe city has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb, mild in relation to East Germany). Like the rest of the lower Rhineland, D\u00fcsseldorf experiences moderate winters with little snowfall and mild to warm summers. The average annual temperature is 10.6 \u00b0C (51 \u00b0F) with an average yearly precipitation of 797 millimetres (31 in). The dominant wind direction is from the west with velocities in the range of 3 to 4 m/s (7\u20139 mph), with gusts of 3.5 \u22124.8 m/s (8\u201310.7 mph). The wind is calm (defined as being under 2 m/s or 4.5 mph) about 35% of the time, more frequently at night and in the winter.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nWith a population of 612,178 within the city boundaries (31 December 2015), D\u00fcsseldorf is Germany's seventh largest city. Its population surpassed the threshold of 100,000 inhabitants during the height of industrialisation in 1882, and peaked at just over 705,000 in 1962. The city then began to lose residents with many moving into neighbouring municipalities. However, since the late 1990s, the city's population has been slowly rising again.\nA total of 109,883 (18%) of D\u00fcsseldorf's population are foreigners (31 December 2008), the majority of whom come from within Europe (81,742).

It is obligatory to carry out any journeys to destinations in the city and directly neighbouring cities.\n\n\n=== Carsharing ===\nIn addition to stationary car sharing, where vehicles must be returned to their original location after use, socalled One-way carsharing vehicles have also been available for hire since 2012. These vehicles, which can be parked anywhere where parking is normally allowed within D\u00fcsseldorf, can be rented from Car2go, Greenwheels, Stadtmobil and DriveNow.\n\n\n=== Autobahn ===\nNorth Rhine-Westphalia has the densest network of autobahns in Germany and D\u00fcsseldorf is directly accessible via the A3, A44, A46, A52, A57, A59 and A524.\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nD\u00fcsseldorf is connected to some national and international cycling paths, including EV15 The Rhine Cycle Route.\nThe city of D\u00fcsseldorf is a member of the German North Rhine-Westphalia District, Municipality and City Friends of Pedestrians and Cyclists Working Group, who bestowed upon D\u00fcsseldorf the title of \"Friend of Cyclists City\" in 2007, although the city still has a few gaps in the network of cycle paths in the eyes of many of its citizens.\n\n\n== Culture and recreation ==\nElector Jan Wellem and his wife Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici of Tuscany, were patrons of D\u00fcsseldorf's first significant cultural activities in the 17th and 18th centuries. Heinrich Heine, whose 200th birthday was celebrated in 1997 and who originally had a proposed memorial in the city dedicated to him; Clara and Robert Schumann; and as Felix Mendelssohn, are the most prominent artists related to the city, which is home to a distinguished Academy of Fine Arts.\nThe D\u00fcsseldorf cultural scene comprises traditional and avant-garde, classical and glamorous. The world-famous state art collection of North Rhine-Westphalia, the highly acclaimed Deutsche Oper am Rhein (opera), and the D\u00fcsseldorfer Schauspielhaus (theatre), artistic home of Gustaf Gr\u00fcndgens, are major elements of D\u00fcsseldorf's reputation as a centre of the fine arts.\n\n\n=== Beer ===\nD\u00fcsseldorf is well known for its Altbier, a hoppy beer which translates as old [style] beer, a reference to the pre-lager brewing method of using a warm top-fermenting yeast like British pale ales. Over time the Alt yeast adjusted to lower temperatures, and the Alt brewers would store or lager the beer after fermentation, leading to a cleaner, crisper beer. The name \"altbier\" first appeared in the 19th century to differentiate the beers of D\u00fcsseldorf from the new pale lager that was gaining a hold on Germany.Brewers in D\u00fcsseldorf used the pale malts that were used for the modern pale lagers, but retained the old (\"alt\") method of using warm fermenting yeasts. The first brewery to use the name Alt was Schumacher which opened in 1838. The founder, Mathias Schumacher, allowed the beer to mature in cool conditions in wooden casks for longer than normal, and laid the foundation for the modern alt \u2013 amber coloured and lagered. The result is a pale beer that has some of the lean dryness of a lager but with fruity notes as well.There are five pub-breweries in D\u00fcsseldorf which brew Altbier on the premises: F\u00fcchschen, Schumacher, Schl\u00fcssel, Uerige and Brauerei K\u00fcrzer. Four of the five are in the historic centre of D\u00fcsseldorf (Altstadt); the other (Schumacher), between the Altstadt and D\u00fcsseldorf Central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), also maintains an establishment in the Altstadt, Im Goldenen Kessel, across the street from Schl\u00fcssel.\nEach (except Brauerei K\u00fcrzer) produces a special, secret, seasonal \"Sticke\" version in small quantities, though the names vary: Schl\u00fcssel spells it \"Stike\", without the \"c\", while Schumacher calls its special beer \"Latzenbier\", meaning \"slat beer\", possibly because the kegs from which it was poured had been stored on raised shelves. F\u00fcchschen's seasonal is its Weihnachtsbier (Christmas beer), available in bottles starting mid-November, and served in the brewpub on Christmas Eve.\n\n\n=== Music and nightlife ===\n\nSince the 1950s the \"Kom(m)\u00f6dchen\" has been one of the most prominent political cabarets of Germany. The city's most famous contribution to the culture of modern popular music is beyond doubt the influential avant-garde electronic band Kraftwerk. Formed by a few D\u00fcsseldorf-born musicians, Kraftwerk is internationally known as the most significant band in the history of post-war German music and as pioneers in electronic music. Other influential musical groups originating from D\u00fcsseldorf include Neu!, formed in 1971 by Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother, after their split from Kraftwerk, and La D\u00fcsseldorf, also formed by Dinger in 1976 shortly after Neu! disbanded. Both groups had a significant influence on a variety of subsequent rock, post-punk, and electronic music artists.Internationally known power metal band Warlock was formed in D\u00fcsseldorf in 1982. Its frontwoman, Doro Pesch, had a successful solo career in Europe and Asia since Warlock ended. The punk band Die Toten Hosen, which is famous around the world, also the most popular singers in Germany Westernhagen and Heino come from D\u00fcsseldorf. The electronic act D.A.F. was formed in the city in 1978, as well as the electronic/industrial pioneers Die Krupps in 1980. Another famous formation is Fehlfarben. Founded in the late 1970s by Peter Hein, Frank Fenstermacher, Kurt Dahlke and Michael Kemner.\nD\u00fcsseldorf appears in several songs, including D\u00fcsseldorf by the British indie band Teleman and W\u00e4rst du doch in D\u00fcsseldorf geblieben by Danish singer Dorthe Kollo.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nD\u00fcsseldorf, Germany is the fashion capital of Germany as it is a major cultural center for the art and fashion scenes. The fashionable clothes trend took root in this city before 1949. 1949 is the date of the first fashion show staged in D\u00fcsseldorf. Fashion trends have occurred as access to more elegant clothing for the general public has been a part of the culture for almost a century. Two times a year an event called the, \u201cVoices of Fashion,\u201d occurs and attracts many people to visit D\u00fcsseldorf to find the latest fashion items. There are famous designers that have made a name for themselves in D\u00fcsseldorf as well. Designers Sabine Schumacher, Peter O. Mahler, and Renate Harvan all design in D\u00fcsseldorf. To keep the creativity and passion for fashion alive in D\u00fcsseldorf everyday there are schools dedicated to fashion design in D\u00fcsseldorf as well. Akademie Mode and Design Institution, Design Department Academy, and Mode Design College are the three prominent fashion schools residing in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n=== Carnival ===\n\nOne of the biggest cultural events in D\u00fcsseldorf is the Karneval (also referred to as the \"fifth season\") which starts every year on 11 November at 11:11 a.m., and reaches its climax on Rosenmontag (Rose Monday), featuring a huge parade through the streets of D\u00fcsseldorf. Karneval ends on Aschermittwoch (Ash Wednesday).\n\n\n=== Cartwheeler of D\u00fcsseldorf ===\n\nThe D\u00fcsseldorfer Radschl\u00e4ger (Boy who does Cartwheels) is said to be the city's oldest tradition. The symbol of the cartwheeler can be found on many souvenirs and various things in D\u00fcsseldorf have the cartwheelers to thank for their names. This tradition was honoured in 1954 by the erection of a fountain, called Cartwheeler's Fountain, on the Burgplatz in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n==== Legends of its origin and history ====\nThe tradition cannot be linked to one specific historical event, instead, there are several stories surrounding the beginnings of the D\u00fcsseldorf Cartwheelers. Probably the most well known version is Battle of Worringen. In the battle of 1288 Count Adolf devastatingly defeated the Archbishop of Cologne. As a consequence of this victory, D\u00fcsseldorf obtained Town privileges. The inhabitants, especially the children ran joyfully on the streets and performed cartwheels.\nAnother story talks about a wedding procession during which one of the wheels of the wedding carriage broke. In order to fend off the threat of bad luck, a boy supposedly jumped to the carriage, took hold of the wheel and thus became a living part of the wheel. Whether the story is about the marriage of Jan Wellem and Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici or the wedding of Margravine Jakobea of Baden and Johann Wilhelm is debatable.\nAnother story gives an account of this wedding between Margrave Jacobe von Baden and Johann Wilhelm, in 1585. According to legend she felt miserable about her marriage, but the cartwheelers who displayed their skills next to her carriage were able to make her smile. Numerous travelers were attracted to the city by great exhibitions \u2013 the forerunner of today's fairs \u2013 between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. During this time the children who did the cart wheeling found out that it was a profitable source of income. The bourgeoisie accepted this in good humour as a symbolic act of local patriotism. In the beginning the lads shouted \"f\u00f6r eene Penning schlage ich das Rad\u201c (cartwheel for a penny). The Jan Wellem monument returned to D\u00fcsseldorf at the end of the Second World War. The procession was accompanied by torches, fanfares and the cartwheeling boys.\n\n\n===== Cartwheelers in the cityscape =====\nCartwheelers can be found by several fountains within the city and near many small landmarks. The most famous is Cartwheeler's Fountain in Burgplatz with an inscription of a quote by Hans M\u00fcller-Schl\u00f6sser: \"Radschl\u00e4ger wolle mer blieve, wie jeck et de Minschen och drieve\u201c (We will always remain cartwheelers, however crazy it drives people.) The fountain was designed by Alfred Zschorsch in 1954 and donated by the  Heimatverein D\u00fcsseldorfer Jonges, which is a club devoted to the maintenance of local and regional traditions. There are other cartwheelers that decorate storm drains and the door knocker on the Church of Lambertus, which was designed by Friedrich Becker. He created the cartwheeler in front of the Schadow Arcades.This tradition has been kept alive by the Alde D\u00fcsseldorfer B\u00fcrgergesellschaft von 1920 e. V., a society founded in 1920, who organized the first cartwheeler competition on 17 October 1937. Since 1971 this event has been held annually in cooperation with the Stadtsparkasse (a local bank), but formerly took place in the K\u00f6nigsallee. Since 2006 it has taken place on the Rheinwerft, near the old part of town. This is a fixed date in the city\u2019s calendar of events. About 500 boys regularly participate in this event and since 1971 girls have also taken part. In 2001 the art project Radschl\u00e4ger-Kunst (Cartwheeler Art) was called into life, in which over 100 cartwheeler sculptures have been designed by various artists. The door knocker on the Church of Lambertus functioned as a model for the sculptures that are 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) high, 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) wide and 30 cm (12 in) deep. They were positioned around the city centre. Some of the sculptures have been auctioned off to companies and private owners.\n\n\n=== Christmas market ===\nEvery Christmas, the city of D\u00fcsseldorf uses the city centre to host one of the largest Christmas gatherings in Germany. The Christmas festival occurs every year from 17 November until 23 December. This Christmas fest brings D\u00fcsseldorf a large portion of tourism every year as many people from nearby areas come to the city to drink mulled wine and hot chocolate and watch craftsman blow glass and create art. The event contains many small wooden buildings all clustered in the middle of the city for all the citizens to enjoy. The event, to many visitors, has an old European feel, but is very lively.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nTraditional meals in the region are Rheinischer Sauerbraten (a beef roast and sometimes horse marinated for a few days in vinegar and spices served with gravy and raisins) and Heaven and Earth (Himmel und \u00c4d; black pudding with stewed apples mixed with mashed potatoes). In winter the people like to eat Muscheln Rheinischer Art (Rhenish-style mussels) as well as Reibekuchen (fried potato pancake served with apple sauce). Also a special meal: D\u00fcsseldorfer Senfrostbraten (Steaks roasted with D\u00fcsseldorf mustard on top).\nD\u00fcsseldorf is known for its strong Dijon-like mustard served in a traditional pot called \"Mostertp\u00f6ttche\", which was eternalised in a still life by Vincent van Gogh in 1884.The Rhine Metropolis is one of the most diverse areas in terms of culinary diversity. D\u00fcsseldorf, with the third largest Japanese community in Europe, not only provides a wide range of culinary cuisine but also has a solid foundation of Authentic Asian food in the city.

Along with a broad range of diverse cultural cuisine, D\u00fcsseldorf is also home to various Michelin starred restaurants that are world renowned.Halve Hahn \u2013 this dish is made from a half a double rye roll, which is another of the specialties of D\u00fcsseldorf, buttered, with a thick slice of aged Gouda cheese, onions, mustard, ground paprika and sour pickles.\nHimmel un Aad \u2013 a dish of mashed potatoes and apples along with slices of blutwurst. Caramelized onions are usually served with this meal.\nReibekuchen is another famous dish from D\u00fcsseldorf; this dish is usually drizzled with R\u00fcbensyrup (beet syrup) and is served on pumpernickel slices along with applesauce\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nThe F\u00f6rderpreis f\u00fcr Literatur der Landeshauptstadt D\u00fcsseldorf is a German Literary award donated by the City of D\u00fcsseldorf in Northrhine-Westphalia.

The rivalry includes carnival parades, football, ice hockey and beer. People in Cologne prefer K\u00f6lsch while people in D\u00fcsseldorf prefer Alt. Waiters and patrons will \"scorn\" and make a \"mockery\" of people who order Alt beer in Cologne and K\u00f6lsch in D\u00fcsseldorf. The rivalry has been described as a \"love-hate relationship\".\n\n\n=== Theatres ===\n\nApollo (variet\u00e9, circus; shows do not require knowledge of German language)\nCapitol (musicals)\nDeutsche Oper am Rhein (Opera; Ballet)\nD\u00fcsseldorfer Schauspielhaus; the theatre started with theatrical performances in 1585\nD\u00fcsseldorfer Marionetten-Theater\nMerkur Spiel-Arena (Venue of the Eurovision Song Contest 2011)\nFFT \u2013 Forum Freies Theater (intimate theatre)\nJunges Theater in der Altstadt\nKlangraum (20th-century classical music)\nKom(m)\u00f6dchen (Political cabaret)\nKom\u00f6die D\u00fcsseldorf\nPalais Wittgenstein\nPuppentheater an der Helmholtzstra\u00dfe (puppetry)\nRobert-Schumann-Saal\nSavoy-Theater\nSeniorentheater in der Altstadt\nTanzhaus NRW (theatre for dance)\nTonhalle D\u00fcsseldorf (concert hall for classical music, jazz, pop, cabaret)\nTheater an der K\u00f6\nTheater an der Luegallee\nTheateratelier Takelgarn\nTheater Flin\nTheater Glorreich\n\n\n=== Museums, arts and history institutes, and other attractions ===\n\nAkademie-Galerie (exhibition space of the Art Academy D\u00fcsseldorf)\nAndreaskirche\nAquazoo-L\u00f6bbecke-Museum (aquarium and zoological museum)\nTvTower\nBRAUSE \u2013 Vereinsheim des Metzgerei Schnitzel Kunstvereins e.V.\nFilm museum\nFilmstiftung NRW (NRW Film Foundation)\nForum NRW\nGoethe-Museum\nHeinrich-Heine-Institut\nHeinrich Heine Birth-house\nHetjens Museum (German museum of ceramics)\nImai \u2013 inter media art institute\nInstitut Fran\u00e7ais D\u00fcsseldorf\nInstitut f\u00fcr Kunstdokumentation und Szenografie (Institute for Art Documentation and Scenography)\nJulia Stoschek Collection (video art)\nKAI 10|Raum f\u00fcr Kunst\nKulturbahnhof Eller\nKunstarchiv Kaiserswerth (works of Bernd and Hilla Becher/Kahmen Collection)\nKunst im Tunnel (KIT)\nKunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen (Art Collection Northrhine-Westphalia) \u2013 K20 (Grabbeplatz) and K21 (St\u00e4ndehaus)\nKunsthalle D\u00fcsseldorf\nKunstverein f\u00fcr die Rheinlande und Westfalen (Society for the Promotion of the Fine Arts)\nMuseum Kunst Palast\nMahn- und Gedenkst\u00e4tte f\u00fcr die Opfer des Nationalsozialmus (Memorial museum for victims of Nationalsocialism)\nOnomato\nPolnisches Institut D\u00fcsseldorf\nPuppentheater an der Helmholtzstra\u00dfe\nRathaus\nReinraum e.V. \u2013 Verein zur F\u00f6rderung von Kunst und Kultur\nRheinturm (Rhine Tower; highest building and landmark of D\u00fcsseldorf)\nSt. Lambertuskirche\nSchiffahrt Museum\nSchloss J\u00e4gerhof\nSchlossturm\nSchloss und Park Benrath (Palace and park of Benrath)\nStadtbibliothek\nStadtmuseum (City history museum)\nStatue of Jan Wellem\nTheatermuseum, D\u00fcsseldorf\nTriton Museum\nVolkshochschule\nZakk \u2013 cultural centre with concerts, readings, debates and party\n\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\nBotanischer Garten D\u00fcsseldorf, a modern botanical garden\nHofgarten\nThe Nordpark, with the Aquazoo\nThe S\u00fcdfriedhof (The South Cemetery)\nVolksgarten adjacent to S\u00fcdpark\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nD\u00fcsseldorf's main football team Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf won the 1933 German championship, the German Cup in 1979 and 1980, and were finalists in the European Cup Winners Cup in 1979.

        "wiki": "D\u00fcsseldorf (often Dusseldorf in English sources; UK: , US: , German: [\u02c8d\u028fsl\u0329d\u0254\u0281f] (listen);  Low Franconian and Ripuarian: D\u00fcsseld\u00f6rp ([\u02c8d\u028fsl\u0329d\u0153\u0250\u032fp]); archaic Dutch: Dusseldorp) is the capital and second-largest city of the most populous German state of North Rhine-Westphalia after Cologne, and the seventh-largest city in Germany, with a population of 617,280. At the confluence of the Rhine and its tributary D\u00fcssel, the city lies in the centre of both the Rhine-Ruhr and the Rhineland Metropolitan Regions with the Cologne Bonn Region to its south and the Ruhr to its north. Most of the city lies on the right bank of the Rhine (as opposed to Cologne, whose city centre lies on the river's left bank). The city is the largest in the German Low Franconian dialect area (closely related to Dutch). \"Dorf\" meaning \"village\" in German, the \"-dorf\" suffix (English cognate: thorp) is unusual in the German-speaking area for a settlement of D\u00fcsseldorf's size.\nMercer's 2012 Quality of Living survey ranked D\u00fcsseldorf the sixth most livable city in the world. D\u00fcsseldorf Airport is Germany's third-busiest airport after those of Frankfurt and Munich, serving as the most important international airport for the inhabitants of the densely populated Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area. D\u00fcsseldorf is an international business and financial centre, renowned for its fashion and trade fairs, and is headquarters to one Fortune Global 500 and two DAX companies. Messe D\u00fcsseldorf organises nearly one fifth of premier trade shows. As second largest city of the Rhineland, D\u00fcsseldorf holds Rhenish Carnival celebrations every year in February/March, the D\u00fcsseldorf carnival celebrations being the third most popular in Germany after those held in Cologne and Mainz.There are 22 institutions of higher education in the city including the Heinrich-Heine-Universit\u00e4t D\u00fcsseldorf, the university of applied sciences (Hochschule D\u00fcsseldorf), the academy of arts (Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf) (Joseph Beuys, Emanuel Leutze, August Macke, Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, and Andreas Gursky), and the university of music (Robert-Schumann-Musikhochschule D\u00fcsseldorf). The city is also known for its pioneering influence on electronic/experimental music (Kraftwerk) and its Japanese community.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early development ===\nWhen the Roman Empire was strengthening its position throughout Europe, a few Germanic tribes clung on in marshy territory off the eastern banks of the Rhine. In the 7th and 8th centuries, the odd farming or fishing settlement could be found at the point where the small river D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine. It was from such settlements that the city of D\u00fcsseldorf grew.\n\nThe first written mention of D\u00fcsseldorf (then called Dusseldorp in the local Low Rhenish dialect) dates back to 1135. Under Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa the small town of Kaiserswerth to the north of D\u00fcsseldorf became a well-fortified outpost, where soldiers kept a watchful eye on every movement on the Rhine. Kaiserswerth eventually became a suburb of D\u00fcsseldorf in 1929. In 1186, D\u00fcsseldorf came under the rule of the Counts of Berg. 14 August 1288 is one of the most important dates in the history of D\u00fcsseldorf. On this day the sovereign Count Adolf VIII of Berg granted the village on the banks of the D\u00fcssel town privileges. Before this, a bloody struggle for power had taken place between the Archbishop of Cologne and the count of Berg, culminating in the Battle of Worringen.\n\nThe Archbishop of Cologne's forces were wiped out by the forces of the count of Berg who were supported by citizens and farmers of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf, paving the way for D\u00fcsseldorf's elevation to city status, which is commemorated today by a monument on the Burgplatz. The custom of turning cartwheels is credited to the children of D\u00fcsseldorf. There are variations of the origin of the cartwheeling children. Today the symbol (Der Radschl\u00e4ger) represents the story and every year the D\u00fcsseldorfers celebrate by having a cartwheeling contest. After this battle the relationship between the four cities deteriorated, because they were commercial rivals; it is often said that there is a kind of hostility between the citizens of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf. Today, it finds its expression mainly in a humorous form (especially during the Rhineland Karneval) and in sports.A market square sprang up on the banks of the Rhine and the square was protected by city walls on all four sides. In 1380, the dukes of Berg moved their seat to the town and D\u00fcsseldorf was made regional capital of the Duchy of Berg. During the following centuries several famous landmarks were built, including the Collegiate Church of St Lambertus. In 1609, the ducal line of the United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg died out, and after a virulent struggle over succession, J\u00fclich and Berg fell to the Wittelsbach Counts of Palatinate-Neuburg, who made D\u00fcsseldorf their main domicile, even after they inherited the Electorate of the Palatinate, in 1685, becoming now Prince-electors as Electors Palatine.Under the art-loving Johann Wilhelm II (r. 1690\u20131716), a vast art gallery with a huge selection of paintings and sculptures, were housed in the Stadtschloss (city castle). After his death, the city fell on hard times again, especially after Elector Charles Theodore inherited Bavaria and moved the electoral court to Munich. With him he took the art collection, which became part of what is now the Alte Pinakothek in Munich. Destruction and poverty struck D\u00fcsseldorf after the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon made Berg a Grand Duchy and D\u00fcsseldorf its capital. Johann Devaranne, a leader of Solingen's resistance to Napoleon's conscription decrees, was executed here in 1813. After Napoleon's defeat, the whole Rhineland including Berg was given to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815. The Rhine Province's parliament was established in D\u00fcsseldorf.

Over time the Alt yeast adjusted to lower temperatures, and the Alt brewers would store or lager the beer after fermentation, leading to a cleaner, crisper beer. The name \"altbier\" first appeared in the 19th century to differentiate the beers of D\u00fcsseldorf from the new pale lager that was gaining a hold on Germany.Brewers in D\u00fcsseldorf used the pale malts that were used for the modern pale lagers, but retained the old (\"alt\") method of using warm fermenting yeasts. The first brewery to use the name Alt was Schumacher which opened in 1838. The founder, Mathias Schumacher, allowed the beer to mature in cool conditions in wooden casks for longer than normal, and laid the foundation for the modern alt \u2013 amber coloured and lagered. The result is a pale beer that has some of the lean dryness of a lager but with fruity notes as well.There are five pub-breweries in D\u00fcsseldorf which brew Altbier on the premises: F\u00fcchschen, Schumacher, Schl\u00fcssel, Uerige and Brauerei K\u00fcrzer. Four of the five are in the historic centre of D\u00fcsseldorf (Altstadt); the other (Schumacher), between the Altstadt and D\u00fcsseldorf Central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), also maintains an establishment in the Altstadt, Im Goldenen Kessel, across the street from Schl\u00fcssel.\nEach (except Brauerei K\u00fcrzer) produces a special, secret, seasonal \"Sticke\" version in small quantities, though the names vary: Schl\u00fcssel spells it \"Stike\", without the \"c\", while Schumacher calls its special beer \"Latzenbier\", meaning \"slat beer\", possibly because the kegs from which it was poured had been stored on raised shelves. F\u00fcchschen's seasonal is its Weihnachtsbier (Christmas beer), available in bottles starting mid-November, and served in the brewpub on Christmas Eve.\n\n\n=== Music and nightlife ===\n\nSince the 1950s the \"Kom(m)\u00f6dchen\" has been one of the most prominent political cabarets of Germany. The city's most famous contribution to the culture of modern popular music is beyond doubt the influential avant-garde electronic band Kraftwerk. Formed by a few D\u00fcsseldorf-born musicians, Kraftwerk is internationally known as the most significant band in the history of post-war German music and as pioneers in electronic music. Other influential musical groups originating from D\u00fcsseldorf include Neu!, formed in 1971 by Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother, after their split from Kraftwerk, and La D\u00fcsseldorf, also formed by Dinger in 1976 shortly after Neu! disbanded. Both groups had a significant influence on a variety of subsequent rock, post-punk, and electronic music artists.Internationally known power metal band Warlock was formed in D\u00fcsseldorf in 1982. Its frontwoman, Doro Pesch, had a successful solo career in Europe and Asia since Warlock ended.

The fashionable clothes trend took root in this city before 1949. 1949 is the date of the first fashion show staged in D\u00fcsseldorf. Fashion trends have occurred as access to more elegant clothing for the general public has been a part of the culture for almost a century.

Karneval ends on Aschermittwoch (Ash Wednesday).\n\n\n=== Cartwheeler of D\u00fcsseldorf ===\n\nThe D\u00fcsseldorfer Radschl\u00e4ger (Boy who does Cartwheels) is said to be the city's oldest tradition. The symbol of the cartwheeler can be found on many souvenirs and various things in D\u00fcsseldorf have the cartwheelers to thank for their names. This tradition was honoured in 1954 by the erection of a fountain, called Cartwheeler's Fountain, on the Burgplatz in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n==== Legends of its origin and history ====\nThe tradition cannot be linked to one specific historical event, instead, there are several stories surrounding the beginnings of the D\u00fcsseldorf Cartwheelers. Probably the most well known version is Battle of Worringen. In the battle of 1288 Count Adolf devastatingly defeated the Archbishop of Cologne. As a consequence of this victory, D\u00fcsseldorf obtained Town privileges. The inhabitants, especially the children ran joyfully on the streets and performed cartwheels.\nAnother story talks about a wedding procession during which one of the wheels of the wedding carriage broke. In order to fend off the threat of bad luck, a boy supposedly jumped to the carriage, took hold of the wheel and thus became a living part of the wheel. Whether the story is about the marriage of Jan Wellem and Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici or the wedding of Margravine Jakobea of Baden and Johann Wilhelm is debatable.\nAnother story gives an account of this wedding between Margrave Jacobe von Baden and Johann Wilhelm, in 1585. According to legend she felt miserable about her marriage, but the cartwheelers who displayed their skills next to her carriage were able to make her smile. Numerous travelers were attracted to the city by great exhibitions \u2013 the forerunner of today's fairs \u2013 between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. During this time the children who did the cart wheeling found out that it was a profitable source of income. The bourgeoisie accepted this in good humour as a symbolic act of local patriotism. In the beginning the lads shouted \"f\u00f6r eene Penning schlage ich das Rad\u201c (cartwheel for a penny). The Jan Wellem monument returned to D\u00fcsseldorf at the end of the Second World War. The procession was accompanied by torches, fanfares and the cartwheeling boys.\n\n\n===== Cartwheelers in the cityscape =====\nCartwheelers can be found by several fountains within the city and near many small landmarks. The most famous is Cartwheeler's Fountain in Burgplatz with an inscription of a quote by Hans M\u00fcller-Schl\u00f6sser: \"Radschl\u00e4ger wolle mer blieve, wie jeck et de Minschen och drieve\u201c (We will always remain cartwheelers, however crazy it drives people.) The fountain was designed by Alfred Zschorsch in 1954 and donated by the  Heimatverein D\u00fcsseldorfer Jonges, which is a club devoted to the maintenance of local and regional traditions. There are other cartwheelers that decorate storm drains and the door knocker on the Church of Lambertus, which was designed by Friedrich Becker. He created the cartwheeler in front of the Schadow Arcades.This tradition has been kept alive by the Alde D\u00fcsseldorfer B\u00fcrgergesellschaft von 1920 e. V., a society founded in 1920, who organized the first cartwheeler competition on 17 October 1937. Since 1971 this event has been held annually in cooperation with the Stadtsparkasse (a local bank), but formerly took place in the K\u00f6nigsallee. Since 2006 it has taken place on the Rheinwerft, near the old part of town. This is a fixed date in the city\u2019s calendar of events. About 500 boys regularly participate in this event and since 1971 girls have also taken part. In 2001 the art project Radschl\u00e4ger-Kunst (Cartwheeler Art) was called into life, in which over 100 cartwheeler sculptures have been designed by various artists. The door knocker on the Church of Lambertus functioned as a model for the sculptures that are 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) high, 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) wide and 30 cm (12 in) deep. They were positioned around the city centre. Some of the sculptures have been auctioned off to companies and private owners.\n\n\n=== Christmas market ===\nEvery Christmas, the city of D\u00fcsseldorf uses the city centre to host one of the largest Christmas gatherings in Germany. The Christmas festival occurs every year from 17 November until 23 December. This Christmas fest brings D\u00fcsseldorf a large portion of tourism every year as many people from nearby areas come to the city to drink mulled wine and hot chocolate and watch craftsman blow glass and create art. The event contains many small wooden buildings all clustered in the middle of the city for all the citizens to enjoy.

At the confluence of the Rhine and its tributary D\u00fcssel, the city lies in the centre of both the Rhine-Ruhr and the Rhineland Metropolitan Regions with the Cologne Bonn Region to its south and the Ruhr to its north. Most of the city lies on the right bank of the Rhine (as opposed to Cologne, whose city centre lies on the river's left bank). The city is the largest in the German Low Franconian dialect area (closely related to Dutch). \"Dorf\" meaning \"village\" in German, the \"-dorf\" suffix (English cognate: thorp) is unusual in the German-speaking area for a settlement of D\u00fcsseldorf's size.\nMercer's 2012 Quality of Living survey ranked D\u00fcsseldorf the sixth most livable city in the world. D\u00fcsseldorf Airport is Germany's third-busiest airport after those of Frankfurt and Munich, serving as the most important international airport for the inhabitants of the densely populated Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area. D\u00fcsseldorf is an international business and financial centre, renowned for its fashion and trade fairs, and is headquarters to one Fortune Global 500 and two DAX companies. Messe D\u00fcsseldorf organises nearly one fifth of premier trade shows. As second largest city of the Rhineland, D\u00fcsseldorf holds Rhenish Carnival celebrations every year in February/March, the D\u00fcsseldorf carnival celebrations being the third most popular in Germany after those held in Cologne and Mainz.There are 22 institutions of higher education in the city including the Heinrich-Heine-Universit\u00e4t D\u00fcsseldorf, the university of applied sciences (Hochschule D\u00fcsseldorf), the academy of arts (Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf) (Joseph Beuys, Emanuel Leutze, August Macke, Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, and Andreas Gursky), and the university of music (Robert-Schumann-Musikhochschule D\u00fcsseldorf). The city is also known for its pioneering influence on electronic/experimental music (Kraftwerk) and its Japanese community.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early development ===\nWhen the Roman Empire was strengthening its position throughout Europe, a few Germanic tribes clung on in marshy territory off the eastern banks of the Rhine. In the 7th and 8th centuries, the odd farming or fishing settlement could be found at the point where the small river D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine. It was from such settlements that the city of D\u00fcsseldorf grew.\n\nThe first written mention of D\u00fcsseldorf (then called Dusseldorp in the local Low Rhenish dialect) dates back to 1135. Under Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa the small town of Kaiserswerth to the north of D\u00fcsseldorf became a well-fortified outpost, where soldiers kept a watchful eye on every movement on the Rhine. Kaiserswerth eventually became a suburb of D\u00fcsseldorf in 1929. In 1186, D\u00fcsseldorf came under the rule of the Counts of Berg. 14 August 1288 is one of the most important dates in the history of D\u00fcsseldorf. On this day the sovereign Count Adolf VIII of Berg granted the village on the banks of the D\u00fcssel town privileges. Before this, a bloody struggle for power had taken place between the Archbishop of Cologne and the count of Berg, culminating in the Battle of Worringen.\n\nThe Archbishop of Cologne's forces were wiped out by the forces of the count of Berg who were supported by citizens and farmers of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf, paving the way for D\u00fcsseldorf's elevation to city status, which is commemorated today by a monument on the Burgplatz. The custom of turning cartwheels is credited to the children of D\u00fcsseldorf. There are variations of the origin of the cartwheeling children. Today the symbol (Der Radschl\u00e4ger) represents the story and every year the D\u00fcsseldorfers celebrate by having a cartwheeling contest. After this battle the relationship between the four cities deteriorated, because they were commercial rivals; it is often said that there is a kind of hostility between the citizens of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf. Today, it finds its expression mainly in a humorous form (especially during the Rhineland Karneval) and in sports.A market square sprang up on the banks of the Rhine and the square was protected by city walls on all four sides. In 1380, the dukes of Berg moved their seat to the town and D\u00fcsseldorf was made regional capital of the Duchy of Berg. During the following centuries several famous landmarks were built, including the Collegiate Church of St Lambertus. In 1609, the ducal line of the United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg died out, and after a virulent struggle over succession, J\u00fclich and Berg fell to the Wittelsbach Counts of Palatinate-Neuburg, who made D\u00fcsseldorf their main domicile, even after they inherited the Electorate of the Palatinate, in 1685, becoming now Prince-electors as Electors Palatine.Under the art-loving Johann Wilhelm II (r. 1690\u20131716), a vast art gallery with a huge selection of paintings and sculptures, were housed in the Stadtschloss (city castle). After his death, the city fell on hard times again, especially after Elector Charles Theodore inherited Bavaria and moved the electoral court to Munich. With him he took the art collection, which became part of what is now the Alte Pinakothek in Munich. Destruction and poverty struck D\u00fcsseldorf after the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon made Berg a Grand Duchy and D\u00fcsseldorf its capital. Johann Devaranne, a leader of Solingen's resistance to Napoleon's conscription decrees, was executed here in 1813. After Napoleon's defeat, the whole Rhineland including Berg was given to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815. The Rhine Province's parliament was established in D\u00fcsseldorf. By the mid-19th century, D\u00fcsseldorf enjoyed a revival thanks to the Industrial Revolution as the city boasted 100,000 inhabitants by 1882; the figure doubled in 1892.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nDuring World War I the Royal Naval Air Service (RNS) undertook the first Entente strategic bombing missions on 22 September 1914, when it bombed the Zeppelin bases in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\nIn 1920, D\u00fcsseldorf became the centre of the General Strike.

Raids continued late into the war. As part of the campaign against German oil facilities, the RAF raid of 20\u201321 February on the Rhenania Ossag refinery in the Reisholz district of the city halted oil production there. The Allied ground advance into Germany reached D\u00fcsseldorf in mid-April 1945.

Over time the Alt yeast adjusted to lower temperatures, and the Alt brewers would store or lager the beer after fermentation, leading to a cleaner, crisper beer. The name \"altbier\" first appeared in the 19th century to differentiate the beers of D\u00fcsseldorf from the new pale lager that was gaining a hold on Germany.Brewers in D\u00fcsseldorf used the pale malts that were used for the modern pale lagers, but retained the old (\"alt\") method of using warm fermenting yeasts. The first brewery to use the name Alt was Schumacher which opened in 1838. The founder, Mathias Schumacher, allowed the beer to mature in cool conditions in wooden casks for longer than normal, and laid the foundation for the modern alt \u2013 amber coloured and lagered. The result is a pale beer that has some of the lean dryness of a lager but with fruity notes as well.There are five pub-breweries in D\u00fcsseldorf which brew Altbier on the premises: F\u00fcchschen, Schumacher, Schl\u00fcssel, Uerige and Brauerei K\u00fcrzer. Four of the five are in the historic centre of D\u00fcsseldorf (Altstadt); the other (Schumacher), between the Altstadt and D\u00fcsseldorf Central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), also maintains an establishment in the Altstadt, Im Goldenen Kessel, across the street from Schl\u00fcssel.\nEach (except Brauerei K\u00fcrzer) produces a special, secret, seasonal \"Sticke\" version in small quantities, though the names vary: Schl\u00fcssel spells it \"Stike\", without the \"c\", while Schumacher calls its special beer \"Latzenbier\", meaning \"slat beer\", possibly because the kegs from which it was poured had been stored on raised shelves. F\u00fcchschen's seasonal is its Weihnachtsbier (Christmas beer), available in bottles starting mid-November, and served in the brewpub on Christmas Eve.\n\n\n=== Music and nightlife ===\n\nSince the 1950s the \"Kom(m)\u00f6dchen\" has been one of the most prominent political cabarets of Germany. The city's most famous contribution to the culture of modern popular music is beyond doubt the influential avant-garde electronic band Kraftwerk. Formed by a few D\u00fcsseldorf-born musicians, Kraftwerk is internationally known as the most significant band in the history of post-war German music and as pioneers in electronic music. Other influential musical groups originating from D\u00fcsseldorf include Neu!, formed in 1971 by Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother, after their split from Kraftwerk, and La D\u00fcsseldorf, also formed by Dinger in 1976 shortly after Neu! disbanded. Both groups had a significant influence on a variety of subsequent rock, post-punk, and electronic music artists.Internationally known power metal band Warlock was formed in D\u00fcsseldorf in 1982. Its frontwoman, Doro Pesch, had a successful solo career in Europe and Asia since Warlock ended. The punk band Die Toten Hosen, which is famous around the world, also the most popular singers in Germany Westernhagen and Heino come from D\u00fcsseldorf.

Founded in the late 1970s by Peter Hein, Frank Fenstermacher, Kurt Dahlke and Michael Kemner.\nD\u00fcsseldorf appears in several songs, including D\u00fcsseldorf by the British indie band Teleman and W\u00e4rst du doch in D\u00fcsseldorf geblieben by Danish singer Dorthe Kollo.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nD\u00fcsseldorf, Germany is the fashion capital of Germany as it is a major cultural center for the art and fashion scenes. The fashionable clothes trend took root in this city before 1949. 1949 is the date of the first fashion show staged in D\u00fcsseldorf. Fashion trends have occurred as access to more elegant clothing for the general public has been a part of the culture for almost a century. Two times a year an event called the, \u201cVoices of Fashion,\u201d occurs and attracts many people to visit D\u00fcsseldorf to find the latest fashion items. There are famous designers that have made a name for themselves in D\u00fcsseldorf as well. Designers Sabine Schumacher, Peter O. Mahler, and Renate Harvan all design in D\u00fcsseldorf.

Karneval ends on Aschermittwoch (Ash Wednesday).\n\n\n=== Cartwheeler of D\u00fcsseldorf ===\n\nThe D\u00fcsseldorfer Radschl\u00e4ger (Boy who does Cartwheels) is said to be the city's oldest tradition. The symbol of the cartwheeler can be found on many souvenirs and various things in D\u00fcsseldorf have the cartwheelers to thank for their names. This tradition was honoured in 1954 by the erection of a fountain, called Cartwheeler's Fountain, on the Burgplatz in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n==== Legends of its origin and history ====\nThe tradition cannot be linked to one specific historical event, instead, there are several stories surrounding the beginnings of the D\u00fcsseldorf Cartwheelers. Probably the most well known version is Battle of Worringen. In the battle of 1288 Count Adolf devastatingly defeated the Archbishop of Cologne. As a consequence of this victory, D\u00fcsseldorf obtained Town privileges. The inhabitants, especially the children ran joyfully on the streets and performed cartwheels.\nAnother story talks about a wedding procession during which one of the wheels of the wedding carriage broke. In order to fend off the threat of bad luck, a boy supposedly jumped to the carriage, took hold of the wheel and thus became a living part of the wheel. Whether the story is about the marriage of Jan Wellem and Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici or the wedding of Margravine Jakobea of Baden and Johann Wilhelm is debatable.\nAnother story gives an account of this wedding between Margrave Jacobe von Baden and Johann Wilhelm, in 1585. According to legend she felt miserable about her marriage, but the cartwheelers who displayed their skills next to her carriage were able to make her smile. Numerous travelers were attracted to the city by great exhibitions \u2013 the forerunner of today's fairs \u2013 between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. During this time the children who did the cart wheeling found out that it was a profitable source of income. The bourgeoisie accepted this in good humour as a symbolic act of local patriotism. In the beginning the lads shouted \"f\u00f6r eene Penning schlage ich das Rad\u201c (cartwheel for a penny). The Jan Wellem monument returned to D\u00fcsseldorf at the end of the Second World War. The procession was accompanied by torches, fanfares and the cartwheeling boys.\n\n\n===== Cartwheelers in the cityscape =====\nCartwheelers can be found by several fountains within the city and near many small landmarks. The most famous is Cartwheeler's Fountain in Burgplatz with an inscription of a quote by Hans M\u00fcller-Schl\u00f6sser: \"Radschl\u00e4ger wolle mer blieve, wie jeck et de Minschen och drieve\u201c (We will always remain cartwheelers, however crazy it drives people.) The fountain was designed by Alfred Zschorsch in 1954 and donated by the  Heimatverein D\u00fcsseldorfer Jonges, which is a club devoted to the maintenance of local and regional traditions. There are other cartwheelers that decorate storm drains and the door knocker on the Church of Lambertus, which was designed by Friedrich Becker. He created the cartwheeler in front of the Schadow Arcades.This tradition has been kept alive by the Alde D\u00fcsseldorfer B\u00fcrgergesellschaft von 1920 e. V., a society founded in 1920, who organized the first cartwheeler competition on 17 October 1937. Since 1971 this event has been held annually in cooperation with the Stadtsparkasse (a local bank), but formerly took place in the K\u00f6nigsallee. Since 2006 it has taken place on the Rheinwerft, near the old part of town. This is a fixed date in the city\u2019s calendar of events. About 500 boys regularly participate in this event and since 1971 girls have also taken part. In 2001 the art project Radschl\u00e4ger-Kunst (Cartwheeler Art) was called into life, in which over 100 cartwheeler sculptures have been designed by various artists. The door knocker on the Church of Lambertus functioned as a model for the sculptures that are 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) high, 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) wide and 30 cm (12 in) deep. They were positioned around the city centre. Some of the sculptures have been auctioned off to companies and private owners.\n\n\n=== Christmas market ===\nEvery Christmas, the city of D\u00fcsseldorf uses the city centre to host one of the largest Christmas gatherings in Germany. The Christmas festival occurs every year from 17 November until 23 December. This Christmas fest brings D\u00fcsseldorf a large portion of tourism every year as many people from nearby areas come to the city to drink mulled wine and hot chocolate and watch craftsman blow glass and create art. The event contains many small wooden buildings all clustered in the middle of the city for all the citizens to enjoy. The event, to many visitors, has an old European feel, but is very lively.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nTraditional meals in the region are Rheinischer Sauerbraten (a beef roast and sometimes horse marinated for a few days in vinegar and spices served with gravy and raisins) and Heaven and Earth (Himmel und \u00c4d; black pudding with stewed apples mixed with mashed potatoes). In winter the people like to eat Muscheln Rheinischer Art (Rhenish-style mussels) as well as Reibekuchen (fried potato pancake served with apple sauce). Also a special meal: D\u00fcsseldorfer Senfrostbraten (Steaks roasted with D\u00fcsseldorf mustard on top).\nD\u00fcsseldorf is known for its strong Dijon-like mustard served in a traditional pot called \"Mostertp\u00f6ttche\", which was eternalised in a still life by Vincent van Gogh in 1884.The Rhine Metropolis is one of the most diverse areas in terms of culinary diversity.

        "wiki": "Unterbach was a local borough of Erkrath, Germany, until 1975, when it became an urban borough of D\u00fcsseldorf in a local reorganisation. A portion of the pre-1975 Unterbach remains as the borough of Erkrath-Unterfeldhaus. The eastern end of the borough of D\u00fcsseldorf-Vennhausen was attached to Unterbach during the reorganisation since it was already culturally associated with Unterbach.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe name of the local part comes from the knights van Unterbeke, whose seat was the House of Unterbach \u2013 an old water castle, first mentioned as seat of the knights in 1169. The gallery of the lords of the House of Unterbach and their coats of arms are to be discovered elsewhere in Unterbach on the monument, which also serves as homeland and war memorial. The columns of the monument bear the names in time-correct sequence in stone. Further local historical buildings of Unterbach are mentioned at the former customs office at the eastern local entrance \"at the Zault\", the tubing mill and the association house.\n\n\n=== House Unterbach ===\n\nHouse Unterbach was probably established in the times of the Carolingian dynasty. Probably from fear for the Hungarians, who burned down Gerresheim and its neighboring places nearly completely, the area was for the first time removed around 900 AD to the castle. \nAs a knight's seat it is recorded in 1169 for the first time. Probably around 1300 it came then to the today's substantial development of the attachment with encircling walls up to 1.20 meters thick, four towers with walls up to two meters thick, surrounded by a broad water ditch. Parts of the circulating wall and three of the towers are still perceptible today, i.e. a gate tower, a court tower and a round tower. A further round tower, which was formerly on the left, was torn off at the height of the manor-house and integrated into this. Parts of the course bridge mechanism are likewise still to be seen in the gate tower. Beside it are still further authentic knight material stores in the towers. The towers are 10 meters high up to 9 meters in diameter. Probably one of them was in former times once higher. The garden plantings of the castle and the surrounding area were created by the well-known landscape architect Maximilian Friedrich Weyhe, to whose numerous works also belongs the Hofgarten and the world-famous K\u00f6nigsallee.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nUnterbach lies in the southeast of the city D\u00fcsseldorf and is the fifth-largest quarter of D\u00fcsseldorf, with an area of 9.13 km2. A large part of this area is the local recreation area Lake Unterbach (Unterbacher See). In Unterbach just like in neighboring Vennhausen around the lake a moorland colonizing one operated approximately, of it street names witnessed such as Vennstrasse (fen street), as well as large ones and small peat break. Details are however not well known. Unterbach is separated by a forest belt from the close-lying boroughs of D\u00fcsseldorf. The first hills of the Bergisches Land terminate here at the lower Rhine level and give Unterbach, in comparison to remaining D\u00fcsseldorf, a hilly character. Thus Unterbach climbs from here, beginning on Lake Unterbach at the foot of the Korresberg, rising behind the closed land development in the city of Erkrath, to a height of 100 meters. This location, the local recreation area of Unterbacher lake/Eller forest and the partial Unterbach forest lying on Erkrath's area makes it into a borough with a high standard of living. Unterbach has about 7,254 inhabitants with a small population density of 795 inhabitants for each km\u00b2.\n\n\n=== Lake Unterbach ===\n\nThe Lake Unterbach (Unterbacher See), in the local linguistic usage excavator hole, is a former excavator lake in the quarter Unterbach in the southeast of D\u00fcsseldorf. It is 87 hectares large and up to 13.4 m deep. Around the lake lies the protected area Eller forest, which consists to a large extent of sparse woods. Within this forest there are numerous moving and cycle tracks. In the lake are four islands proven as bird protecting area. Water does not have an above ground inlet, it is fed only by groundwater. It was created by excavating for gravel and sands between 1926 and 1973. During the World War II there was a fake airfield of the German air force put there for the deception of allied bombers. With the surface removal of gravel, groundwater flows through the lake and determines also its water level.\nThe lake represents an important local recreation area for the region of D\u00fcsseldorf.\nOn the north bank are also an observation deck with restaurant, a mini golf course and a small sailing boat port with boat rental business as well as a rowboat port used by schools from D\u00fcsseldorf and Erkrath.\nThere is a campground on the south and there are two beaches in the north and the south, including a nude beach at the southern beach.\nThe Lake Unterbach is administered by a public society, which was created on 7 February 1956 by the neighboring cities D\u00fcsseldorf, Erkrath and Hilden.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nUnterbach has retained its village character with its active association and church life, firmly established as a geographically separate quarter of D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n=== Carnival ===\nUnterbach has maintained for itself a singular character within D\u00fcsseldorf from old times in regard to the carnival: It is the only quarter with an absolutely independent carnival board, its own pair of princes and separation. Here also is the origin in the region of D\u00fcsseldorf for the dialect expressions \"Halven cock\" and \"old shot\". The latter had its greatest success with \"the stars sparkle\", which was originally the slogan song of the session 1997 in the Unterbach carnival. The meetings and the procession in the Unterbach carnival extend into the surrounding cities.\nThe coat of arms animal of Unterbach is the donkey, presented as jumping over the donkey brook. At the shopping centre, \"at the Breidenplatz\", a donkey cast in bronze is set up in the Unterbacher. The Carnival fool's call in Unterbach is the donkey sound \"I-A\" unlike the Rhineland \"Helau\" in the rest of D\u00fcsseldorf. Also the Karnevalsumzug (Carnival Procession) is led off by a living donkey. New citizens can let themselves be struck (tied to?) to the donkey. This donkey culture finds its origin in the fact that D\u00fcsseldorf was partly built from and on the sand, which originated from the Auskiesung (dredging) of the Unterbacher lake and its environs. The sand was transported in former times along the donkey brook and further the today still existing arterial road to D\u00fcsseldorf called Sandtr\u00e4gerweg (sand-carriers way) on the backs of donkeys. The remark \"Unterbach's donkeys are coming\" referred not only to the animals.\nThe donkey brook flows through the neighboring borough of Eller as well as its lock park behind Unterbach. There it flows into the southern D\u00fcssel.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe TV Unterbach 1905 announced the place country wide in the trampoline sports with a first success of a German pupil master and a third place of the pupil crew championship achieved at the same time in 1968. With the further ascent the association became in the years 1978, 1979, 1980, 1982 and 1984 in this discipline of German masters, placed many further German and European titles, a vice-world champion as well as the majority of the German national team. By the allocation to D\u00fcsseldorf in the framework to the association a large practice hall lying in Unterbach is missing to the local reorganisation and does gymnastics at present in the second federal league.\n\n\n== Reorganisation ==\nUnterbach was moved from Erkrath to D\u00fcsseldorf in 1975. A part of Unterbach, called Unterfeldhaus, remained in Erkrath. Since this reorganisation, the inhabitants of the two former Unterbach appear main street sides in different cities. Also the House Unterbach \u2013 as the nucleus of Unterbach \u2013 is on the \"wrong\" roadside and thus in Erkrath. The parts of the Unterbach forest and the sports field of the soccer association sports club Unterbach are on Erkrath's area. Practically this separation however never manifested itself. The cultural, church and association life turn out as in only one local part. Besides many students from Unterbach visit the resuming schools in Erkrath.\n\n\n== External links ==\nUnterbach Online (German)\nDistrict Administration (German)\nCommunal Administration (German)This article is based in part on material from the German Wikipedia.",

        "wiki": "D\u00fcsseldorf (often Dusseldorf in English sources; UK: , US: , German: [\u02c8d\u028fsl\u0329d\u0254\u0281f] (listen);  Low Franconian and Ripuarian: D\u00fcsseld\u00f6rp ([\u02c8d\u028fsl\u0329d\u0153\u0250\u032fp]); archaic Dutch: Dusseldorp) is the capital and second-largest city of the most populous German state of North Rhine-Westphalia after Cologne, and the seventh-largest city in Germany, with a population of 617,280. At the confluence of the Rhine and its tributary D\u00fcssel, the city lies in the centre of both the Rhine-Ruhr and the Rhineland Metropolitan Regions with the Cologne Bonn Region to its south and the Ruhr to its north. Most of the city lies on the right bank of the Rhine (as opposed to Cologne, whose city centre lies on the river's left bank). The city is the largest in the German Low Franconian dialect area (closely related to Dutch). \"Dorf\" meaning \"village\" in German, the \"-dorf\" suffix (English cognate: thorp) is unusual in the German-speaking area for a settlement of D\u00fcsseldorf's size.\nMercer's 2012 Quality of Living survey ranked D\u00fcsseldorf the sixth most livable city in the world. D\u00fcsseldorf Airport is Germany's third-busiest airport after those of Frankfurt and Munich, serving as the most important international airport for the inhabitants of the densely populated Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area. D\u00fcsseldorf is an international business and financial centre, renowned for its fashion and trade fairs, and is headquarters to one Fortune Global 500 and two DAX companies. Messe D\u00fcsseldorf organises nearly one fifth of premier trade shows. As second largest city of the Rhineland, D\u00fcsseldorf holds Rhenish Carnival celebrations every year in February/March, the D\u00fcsseldorf carnival celebrations being the third most popular in Germany after those held in Cologne and Mainz.There are 22 institutions of higher education in the city including the Heinrich-Heine-Universit\u00e4t D\u00fcsseldorf, the university of applied sciences (Hochschule D\u00fcsseldorf), the academy of arts (Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf) (Joseph Beuys, Emanuel Leutze, August Macke, Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, and Andreas Gursky), and the university of music (Robert-Schumann-Musikhochschule D\u00fcsseldorf). The city is also known for its pioneering influence on electronic/experimental music (Kraftwerk) and its Japanese community.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early development ===\nWhen the Roman Empire was strengthening its position throughout Europe, a few Germanic tribes clung on in marshy territory off the eastern banks of the Rhine. In the 7th and 8th centuries, the odd farming or fishing settlement could be found at the point where the small river D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine. It was from such settlements that the city of D\u00fcsseldorf grew.\n\nThe first written mention of D\u00fcsseldorf (then called Dusseldorp in the local Low Rhenish dialect) dates back to 1135. Under Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa the small town of Kaiserswerth to the north of D\u00fcsseldorf became a well-fortified outpost, where soldiers kept a watchful eye on every movement on the Rhine. Kaiserswerth eventually became a suburb of D\u00fcsseldorf in 1929. In 1186, D\u00fcsseldorf came under the rule of the Counts of Berg. 14 August 1288 is one of the most important dates in the history of D\u00fcsseldorf. On this day the sovereign Count Adolf VIII of Berg granted the village on the banks of the D\u00fcssel town privileges. Before this, a bloody struggle for power had taken place between the Archbishop of Cologne and the count of Berg, culminating in the Battle of Worringen.\n\nThe Archbishop of Cologne's forces were wiped out by the forces of the count of Berg who were supported by citizens and farmers of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf, paving the way for D\u00fcsseldorf's elevation to city status, which is commemorated today by a monument on the Burgplatz. The custom of turning cartwheels is credited to the children of D\u00fcsseldorf. There are variations of the origin of the cartwheeling children. Today the symbol (Der Radschl\u00e4ger) represents the story and every year the D\u00fcsseldorfers celebrate by having a cartwheeling contest. After this battle the relationship between the four cities deteriorated, because they were commercial rivals; it is often said that there is a kind of hostility between the citizens of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf. Today, it finds its expression mainly in a humorous form (especially during the Rhineland Karneval) and in sports.A market square sprang up on the banks of the Rhine and the square was protected by city walls on all four sides. In 1380, the dukes of Berg moved their seat to the town and D\u00fcsseldorf was made regional capital of the Duchy of Berg. During the following centuries several famous landmarks were built, including the Collegiate Church of St Lambertus. In 1609, the ducal line of the United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg died out, and after a virulent struggle over succession, J\u00fclich and Berg fell to the Wittelsbach Counts of Palatinate-Neuburg, who made D\u00fcsseldorf their main domicile, even after they inherited the Electorate of the Palatinate, in 1685, becoming now Prince-electors as Electors Palatine.Under the art-loving Johann Wilhelm II (r. 1690\u20131716), a vast art gallery with a huge selection of paintings and sculptures, were housed in the Stadtschloss (city castle). After his death, the city fell on hard times again, especially after Elector Charles Theodore inherited Bavaria and moved the electoral court to Munich. With him he took the art collection, which became part of what is now the Alte Pinakothek in Munich. Destruction and poverty struck D\u00fcsseldorf after the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon made Berg a Grand Duchy and D\u00fcsseldorf its capital. Johann Devaranne, a leader of Solingen's resistance to Napoleon's conscription decrees, was executed here in 1813. After Napoleon's defeat, the whole Rhineland including Berg was given to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815. The Rhine Province's parliament was established in D\u00fcsseldorf.

Over time the Alt yeast adjusted to lower temperatures, and the Alt brewers would store or lager the beer after fermentation, leading to a cleaner, crisper beer. The name \"altbier\" first appeared in the 19th century to differentiate the beers of D\u00fcsseldorf from the new pale lager that was gaining a hold on Germany.Brewers in D\u00fcsseldorf used the pale malts that were used for the modern pale lagers, but retained the old (\"alt\") method of using warm fermenting yeasts. The first brewery to use the name Alt was Schumacher which opened in 1838. The founder, Mathias Schumacher, allowed the beer to mature in cool conditions in wooden casks for longer than normal, and laid the foundation for the modern alt \u2013 amber coloured and lagered. The result is a pale beer that has some of the lean dryness of a lager but with fruity notes as well.There are five pub-breweries in D\u00fcsseldorf which brew Altbier on the premises: F\u00fcchschen, Schumacher, Schl\u00fcssel, Uerige and Brauerei K\u00fcrzer. Four of the five are in the historic centre of D\u00fcsseldorf (Altstadt); the other (Schumacher), between the Altstadt and D\u00fcsseldorf Central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), also maintains an establishment in the Altstadt, Im Goldenen Kessel, across the street from Schl\u00fcssel.\nEach (except Brauerei K\u00fcrzer) produces a special, secret, seasonal \"Sticke\" version in small quantities, though the names vary: Schl\u00fcssel spells it \"Stike\", without the \"c\", while Schumacher calls its special beer \"Latzenbier\", meaning \"slat beer\", possibly because the kegs from which it was poured had been stored on raised shelves. F\u00fcchschen's seasonal is its Weihnachtsbier (Christmas beer), available in bottles starting mid-November, and served in the brewpub on Christmas Eve.\n\n\n=== Music and nightlife ===\n\nSince the 1950s the \"Kom(m)\u00f6dchen\" has been one of the most prominent political cabarets of Germany. The city's most famous contribution to the culture of modern popular music is beyond doubt the influential avant-garde electronic band Kraftwerk. Formed by a few D\u00fcsseldorf-born musicians, Kraftwerk is internationally known as the most significant band in the history of post-war German music and as pioneers in electronic music. Other influential musical groups originating from D\u00fcsseldorf include Neu!, formed in 1971 by Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother, after their split from Kraftwerk, and La D\u00fcsseldorf, also formed by Dinger in 1976 shortly after Neu! disbanded. Both groups had a significant influence on a variety of subsequent rock, post-punk, and electronic music artists.Internationally known power metal band Warlock was formed in D\u00fcsseldorf in 1982. Its frontwoman, Doro Pesch, had a successful solo career in Europe and Asia since Warlock ended.

The fashionable clothes trend took root in this city before 1949. 1949 is the date of the first fashion show staged in D\u00fcsseldorf. Fashion trends have occurred as access to more elegant clothing for the general public has been a part of the culture for almost a century.

Karneval ends on Aschermittwoch (Ash Wednesday).\n\n\n=== Cartwheeler of D\u00fcsseldorf ===\n\nThe D\u00fcsseldorfer Radschl\u00e4ger (Boy who does Cartwheels) is said to be the city's oldest tradition. The symbol of the cartwheeler can be found on many souvenirs and various things in D\u00fcsseldorf have the cartwheelers to thank for their names. This tradition was honoured in 1954 by the erection of a fountain, called Cartwheeler's Fountain, on the Burgplatz in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n==== Legends of its origin and history ====\nThe tradition cannot be linked to one specific historical event, instead, there are several stories surrounding the beginnings of the D\u00fcsseldorf Cartwheelers. Probably the most well known version is Battle of Worringen. In the battle of 1288 Count Adolf devastatingly defeated the Archbishop of Cologne. As a consequence of this victory, D\u00fcsseldorf obtained Town privileges. The inhabitants, especially the children ran joyfully on the streets and performed cartwheels.\nAnother story talks about a wedding procession during which one of the wheels of the wedding carriage broke. In order to fend off the threat of bad luck, a boy supposedly jumped to the carriage, took hold of the wheel and thus became a living part of the wheel. Whether the story is about the marriage of Jan Wellem and Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici or the wedding of Margravine Jakobea of Baden and Johann Wilhelm is debatable.\nAnother story gives an account of this wedding between Margrave Jacobe von Baden and Johann Wilhelm, in 1585. According to legend she felt miserable about her marriage, but the cartwheelers who displayed their skills next to her carriage were able to make her smile. Numerous travelers were attracted to the city by great exhibitions \u2013 the forerunner of today's fairs \u2013 between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. During this time the children who did the cart wheeling found out that it was a profitable source of income. The bourgeoisie accepted this in good humour as a symbolic act of local patriotism. In the beginning the lads shouted \"f\u00f6r eene Penning schlage ich das Rad\u201c (cartwheel for a penny). The Jan Wellem monument returned to D\u00fcsseldorf at the end of the Second World War. The procession was accompanied by torches, fanfares and the cartwheeling boys.\n\n\n===== Cartwheelers in the cityscape =====\nCartwheelers can be found by several fountains within the city and near many small landmarks. The most famous is Cartwheeler's Fountain in Burgplatz with an inscription of a quote by Hans M\u00fcller-Schl\u00f6sser: \"Radschl\u00e4ger wolle mer blieve, wie jeck et de Minschen och drieve\u201c (We will always remain cartwheelers, however crazy it drives people.) The fountain was designed by Alfred Zschorsch in 1954 and donated by the  Heimatverein D\u00fcsseldorfer Jonges, which is a club devoted to the maintenance of local and regional traditions. There are other cartwheelers that decorate storm drains and the door knocker on the Church of Lambertus, which was designed by Friedrich Becker. He created the cartwheeler in front of the Schadow Arcades.This tradition has been kept alive by the Alde D\u00fcsseldorfer B\u00fcrgergesellschaft von 1920 e. V., a society founded in 1920, who organized the first cartwheeler competition on 17 October 1937. Since 1971 this event has been held annually in cooperation with the Stadtsparkasse (a local bank), but formerly took place in the K\u00f6nigsallee. Since 2006 it has taken place on the Rheinwerft, near the old part of town. This is a fixed date in the city\u2019s calendar of events. About 500 boys regularly participate in this event and since 1971 girls have also taken part. In 2001 the art project Radschl\u00e4ger-Kunst (Cartwheeler Art) was called into life, in which over 100 cartwheeler sculptures have been designed by various artists. The door knocker on the Church of Lambertus functioned as a model for the sculptures that are 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) high, 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) wide and 30 cm (12 in) deep. They were positioned around the city centre. Some of the sculptures have been auctioned off to companies and private owners.\n\n\n=== Christmas market ===\nEvery Christmas, the city of D\u00fcsseldorf uses the city centre to host one of the largest Christmas gatherings in Germany. The Christmas festival occurs every year from 17 November until 23 December. This Christmas fest brings D\u00fcsseldorf a large portion of tourism every year as many people from nearby areas come to the city to drink mulled wine and hot chocolate and watch craftsman blow glass and create art. The event contains many small wooden buildings all clustered in the middle of the city for all the citizens to enjoy.

          "Lovely little museum with plenty to see and do. The second floor which houses the history of film and animation is probably the most interesting as it's quite interactive with zoetropes and other equipment. The day/night light effect room was my favourite, very pretty. As",
          "The museum while presenting an overall history of movie making, completely glosses over the importance of films in Nazi propaganda. A questionable parallel between the US Klan and the Nazis is drawn. While interesting overall, I was quite disappointed in the lack of presentation",
          "A good museum close to the old town and right next door to the Ceramics Museum both of which are included on the Dusseldorf Card so an easy way to spend an afternoon, over four floors it is packed with loads of amazing items from through out cinema history well worth a visit!",
          "The museum was okay, although a lot was in German. Not everything was translated to English unfortunately. We bought the Dusseldorf card, due to this the entrance was free. They show different techniques of filming, what is nice to see. As well you are able to interact with",

          "It is an interesting experience, they have many dresses and clothes of good films. It is most based in the old history of the cinema and need new material. But in overall positive experience. I didn\u00b4t had to pay because i went for free with the D\u00fcsseldorf welcome city guide.",
          "As movie lovers we could not skip this one. The museum is located in a relatively small building on 4 different floors. It tries to show a lot of things, maybe a bit too much: not only the (pre)history of movie making with antique panoptica/camera obscura stuff, but also",
          "Comes with the territory of traveling but not much of the museum in is English. The picture and movie clips where awesome. I learned a lot just from observation. They also has an awesome collection of equipment and these porcelain carvings that are magical with backlighting. And",
          "We visited this museum with a group of 25 students (17-19 years old). The entrance price and the price of the guide were very affordable. The guided tour took 90 minutes, and was over in the blink of an eye. There were so many interesting things to discover, and the museum is",
          "The entry fee is now 5 Euros which is still cheap for what you get. Its a great way to spend a rainy afternoon if you are interested in Cinema. There is a lot about German cinema and also about the evolution of creating the moving image. There are some interesting interactive",
          "For only 4 Euro entry fee you can see a neat little museum with a TON of film history. Most of it isn't up to date if you are looking for more recent activities but old cameras, techniques and directors are on display."

It will help if you can read German, but it's such a visual museum we enjoyed it anyway.  There's several interactive exhibits. It was free with a Dusseldorf card.",

        "wiki": "D\u00fcsseldorf (often Dusseldorf in English sources; UK: , US: , German: [\u02c8d\u028fsl\u0329d\u0254\u0281f] (listen);  Low Franconian and Ripuarian: D\u00fcsseld\u00f6rp ([\u02c8d\u028fsl\u0329d\u0153\u0250\u032fp]); archaic Dutch: Dusseldorp) is the capital and second-largest city of the most populous German state of North Rhine-Westphalia after Cologne, and the seventh-largest city in Germany, with a population of 617,280. At the confluence of the Rhine and its tributary D\u00fcssel, the city lies in the centre of both the Rhine-Ruhr and the Rhineland Metropolitan Regions with the Cologne Bonn Region to its south and the Ruhr to its north. Most of the city lies on the right bank of the Rhine (as opposed to Cologne, whose city centre lies on the river's left bank). The city is the largest in the German Low Franconian dialect area (closely related to Dutch). \"Dorf\" meaning \"village\" in German, the \"-dorf\" suffix (English cognate: thorp) is unusual in the German-speaking area for a settlement of D\u00fcsseldorf's size.\nMercer's 2012 Quality of Living survey ranked D\u00fcsseldorf the sixth most livable city in the world. D\u00fcsseldorf Airport is Germany's third-busiest airport after those of Frankfurt and Munich, serving as the most important international airport for the inhabitants of the densely populated Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area. D\u00fcsseldorf is an international business and financial centre, renowned for its fashion and trade fairs, and is headquarters to one Fortune Global 500 and two DAX companies. Messe D\u00fcsseldorf organises nearly one fifth of premier trade shows. As second largest city of the Rhineland, D\u00fcsseldorf holds Rhenish Carnival celebrations every year in February/March, the D\u00fcsseldorf carnival celebrations being the third most popular in Germany after those held in Cologne and Mainz.There are 22 institutions of higher education in the city including the Heinrich-Heine-Universit\u00e4t D\u00fcsseldorf, the university of applied sciences (Hochschule D\u00fcsseldorf), the academy of arts (Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf) (Joseph Beuys, Emanuel Leutze, August Macke, Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, and Andreas Gursky), and the university of music (Robert-Schumann-Musikhochschule D\u00fcsseldorf). The city is also known for its pioneering influence on electronic/experimental music (Kraftwerk) and its Japanese community.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early development ===\nWhen the Roman Empire was strengthening its position throughout Europe, a few Germanic tribes clung on in marshy territory off the eastern banks of the Rhine. In the 7th and 8th centuries, the odd farming or fishing settlement could be found at the point where the small river D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine. It was from such settlements that the city of D\u00fcsseldorf grew.\n\nThe first written mention of D\u00fcsseldorf (then called Dusseldorp in the local Low Rhenish dialect) dates back to 1135. Under Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa the small town of Kaiserswerth to the north of D\u00fcsseldorf became a well-fortified outpost, where soldiers kept a watchful eye on every movement on the Rhine. Kaiserswerth eventually became a suburb of D\u00fcsseldorf in 1929. In 1186, D\u00fcsseldorf came under the rule of the Counts of Berg. 14 August 1288 is one of the most important dates in the history of D\u00fcsseldorf. On this day the sovereign Count Adolf VIII of Berg granted the village on the banks of the D\u00fcssel town privileges. Before this, a bloody struggle for power had taken place between the Archbishop of Cologne and the count of Berg, culminating in the Battle of Worringen.\n\nThe Archbishop of Cologne's forces were wiped out by the forces of the count of Berg who were supported by citizens and farmers of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf, paving the way for D\u00fcsseldorf's elevation to city status, which is commemorated today by a monument on the Burgplatz. The custom of turning cartwheels is credited to the children of D\u00fcsseldorf. There are variations of the origin of the cartwheeling children. Today the symbol (Der Radschl\u00e4ger) represents the story and every year the D\u00fcsseldorfers celebrate by having a cartwheeling contest. After this battle the relationship between the four cities deteriorated, because they were commercial rivals; it is often said that there is a kind of hostility between the citizens of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf. Today, it finds its expression mainly in a humorous form (especially during the Rhineland Karneval) and in sports.A market square sprang up on the banks of the Rhine and the square was protected by city walls on all four sides. In 1380, the dukes of Berg moved their seat to the town and D\u00fcsseldorf was made regional capital of the Duchy of Berg. During the following centuries several famous landmarks were built, including the Collegiate Church of St Lambertus. In 1609, the ducal line of the United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg died out, and after a virulent struggle over succession, J\u00fclich and Berg fell to the Wittelsbach Counts of Palatinate-Neuburg, who made D\u00fcsseldorf their main domicile, even after they inherited the Electorate of the Palatinate, in 1685, becoming now Prince-electors as Electors Palatine.Under the art-loving Johann Wilhelm II (r. 1690\u20131716), a vast art gallery with a huge selection of paintings and sculptures, were housed in the Stadtschloss (city castle). After his death, the city fell on hard times again, especially after Elector Charles Theodore inherited Bavaria and moved the electoral court to Munich. With him he took the art collection, which became part of what is now the Alte Pinakothek in Munich. Destruction and poverty struck D\u00fcsseldorf after the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon made Berg a Grand Duchy and D\u00fcsseldorf its capital. Johann Devaranne, a leader of Solingen's resistance to Napoleon's conscription decrees, was executed here in 1813. After Napoleon's defeat, the whole Rhineland including Berg was given to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815. The Rhine Province's parliament was established in D\u00fcsseldorf. By the mid-19th century, D\u00fcsseldorf enjoyed a revival thanks to the Industrial Revolution as the city boasted 100,000 inhabitants by 1882; the figure doubled in 1892.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nDuring World War I the Royal Naval Air Service (RNS) undertook the first Entente strategic bombing missions on 22 September 1914, when it bombed the Zeppelin bases in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\nIn 1920, D\u00fcsseldorf became the centre of the General Strike. On 15 April 1920, 45 delegates of the German Miners Union were murdered by the Freikorps.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nThe city was a target of strategic bombing during World War II, particularly during the RAF bombing campaign in 1943 when over 700 bombers were used in a single night. Raids continued late into the war. As part of the campaign against German oil facilities, the RAF raid of 20\u201321 February on the Rhenania Ossag refinery in the Reisholz district of the city halted oil production there. The Allied ground advance into Germany reached D\u00fcsseldorf in mid-April 1945. The United States 97th Infantry Division easily captured the city on 18 April 1945, after the local German Resistance group launched Aktion Rheinland.\n\n\n=== German Federal Republic ===\nIn 1946, D\u00fcsseldorf was made capital of the new federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The city's reconstruction proceeded at a frantic pace and the economic transformation guided D\u00fcsseldorf's economic growth.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Physical geography ===\n\nD\u00fcsseldorf lies at the centre of the Lower Rhine basin, where the delta of the D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine.

Over time the Alt yeast adjusted to lower temperatures, and the Alt brewers would store or lager the beer after fermentation, leading to a cleaner, crisper beer. The name \"altbier\" first appeared in the 19th century to differentiate the beers of D\u00fcsseldorf from the new pale lager that was gaining a hold on Germany.Brewers in D\u00fcsseldorf used the pale malts that were used for the modern pale lagers, but retained the old (\"alt\") method of using warm fermenting yeasts. The first brewery to use the name Alt was Schumacher which opened in 1838. The founder, Mathias Schumacher, allowed the beer to mature in cool conditions in wooden casks for longer than normal, and laid the foundation for the modern alt \u2013 amber coloured and lagered. The result is a pale beer that has some of the lean dryness of a lager but with fruity notes as well.There are five pub-breweries in D\u00fcsseldorf which brew Altbier on the premises: F\u00fcchschen, Schumacher, Schl\u00fcssel, Uerige and Brauerei K\u00fcrzer. Four of the five are in the historic centre of D\u00fcsseldorf (Altstadt); the other (Schumacher), between the Altstadt and D\u00fcsseldorf Central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), also maintains an establishment in the Altstadt, Im Goldenen Kessel, across the street from Schl\u00fcssel.\nEach (except Brauerei K\u00fcrzer) produces a special, secret, seasonal \"Sticke\" version in small quantities, though the names vary: Schl\u00fcssel spells it \"Stike\", without the \"c\", while Schumacher calls its special beer \"Latzenbier\", meaning \"slat beer\", possibly because the kegs from which it was poured had been stored on raised shelves. F\u00fcchschen's seasonal is its Weihnachtsbier (Christmas beer), available in bottles starting mid-November, and served in the brewpub on Christmas Eve.\n\n\n=== Music and nightlife ===\n\nSince the 1950s the \"Kom(m)\u00f6dchen\" has been one of the most prominent political cabarets of Germany. The city's most famous contribution to the culture of modern popular music is beyond doubt the influential avant-garde electronic band Kraftwerk. Formed by a few D\u00fcsseldorf-born musicians, Kraftwerk is internationally known as the most significant band in the history of post-war German music and as pioneers in electronic music. Other influential musical groups originating from D\u00fcsseldorf include Neu!, formed in 1971 by Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother, after their split from Kraftwerk, and La D\u00fcsseldorf, also formed by Dinger in 1976 shortly after Neu! disbanded. Both groups had a significant influence on a variety of subsequent rock, post-punk, and electronic music artists.Internationally known power metal band Warlock was formed in D\u00fcsseldorf in 1982. Its frontwoman, Doro Pesch, had a successful solo career in Europe and Asia since Warlock ended. The punk band Die Toten Hosen, which is famous around the world, also the most popular singers in Germany Westernhagen and Heino come from D\u00fcsseldorf. The electronic act D.A.F. was formed in the city in 1978, as well as the electronic/industrial pioneers Die Krupps in 1980. Another famous formation is Fehlfarben. Founded in the late 1970s by Peter Hein, Frank Fenstermacher, Kurt Dahlke and Michael Kemner.\nD\u00fcsseldorf appears in several songs, including D\u00fcsseldorf by the British indie band Teleman and W\u00e4rst du doch in D\u00fcsseldorf geblieben by Danish singer Dorthe Kollo.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nD\u00fcsseldorf, Germany is the fashion capital of Germany as it is a major cultural center for the art and fashion scenes. The fashionable clothes trend took root in this city before 1949. 1949 is the date of the first fashion show staged in D\u00fcsseldorf. Fashion trends have occurred as access to more elegant clothing for the general public has been a part of the culture for almost a century. Two times a year an event called the, \u201cVoices of Fashion,\u201d occurs and attracts many people to visit D\u00fcsseldorf to find the latest fashion items. There are famous designers that have made a name for themselves in D\u00fcsseldorf as well. Designers Sabine Schumacher, Peter O. Mahler, and Renate Harvan all design in D\u00fcsseldorf.

Karneval ends on Aschermittwoch (Ash Wednesday).\n\n\n=== Cartwheeler of D\u00fcsseldorf ===\n\nThe D\u00fcsseldorfer Radschl\u00e4ger (Boy who does Cartwheels) is said to be the city's oldest tradition. The symbol of the cartwheeler can be found on many souvenirs and various things in D\u00fcsseldorf have the cartwheelers to thank for their names. This tradition was honoured in 1954 by the erection of a fountain, called Cartwheeler's Fountain, on the Burgplatz in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n==== Legends of its origin and history ====\nThe tradition cannot be linked to one specific historical event, instead, there are several stories surrounding the beginnings of the D\u00fcsseldorf Cartwheelers. Probably the most well known version is Battle of Worringen. In the battle of 1288 Count Adolf devastatingly defeated the Archbishop of Cologne. As a consequence of this victory, D\u00fcsseldorf obtained Town privileges. The inhabitants, especially the children ran joyfully on the streets and performed cartwheels.\nAnother story talks about a wedding procession during which one of the wheels of the wedding carriage broke. In order to fend off the threat of bad luck, a boy supposedly jumped to the carriage, took hold of the wheel and thus became a living part of the wheel. Whether the story is about the marriage of Jan Wellem and Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici or the wedding of Margravine Jakobea of Baden and Johann Wilhelm is debatable.\nAnother story gives an account of this wedding between Margrave Jacobe von Baden and Johann Wilhelm, in 1585. According to legend she felt miserable about her marriage, but the cartwheelers who displayed their skills next to her carriage were able to make her smile. Numerous travelers were attracted to the city by great exhibitions \u2013 the forerunner of today's fairs \u2013 between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. During this time the children who did the cart wheeling found out that it was a profitable source of income. The bourgeoisie accepted this in good humour as a symbolic act of local patriotism. In the beginning the lads shouted \"f\u00f6r eene Penning schlage ich das Rad\u201c (cartwheel for a penny). The Jan Wellem monument returned to D\u00fcsseldorf at the end of the Second World War. The procession was accompanied by torches, fanfares and the cartwheeling boys.\n\n\n===== Cartwheelers in the cityscape =====\nCartwheelers can be found by several fountains within the city and near many small landmarks. The most famous is Cartwheeler's Fountain in Burgplatz with an inscription of a quote by Hans M\u00fcller-Schl\u00f6sser: \"Radschl\u00e4ger wolle mer blieve, wie jeck et de Minschen och drieve\u201c (We will always remain cartwheelers, however crazy it drives people.) The fountain was designed by Alfred Zschorsch in 1954 and donated by the  Heimatverein D\u00fcsseldorfer Jonges, which is a club devoted to the maintenance of local and regional traditions. There are other cartwheelers that decorate storm drains and the door knocker on the Church of Lambertus, which was designed by Friedrich Becker. He created the cartwheeler in front of the Schadow Arcades.This tradition has been kept alive by the Alde D\u00fcsseldorfer B\u00fcrgergesellschaft von 1920 e. V., a society founded in 1920, who organized the first cartwheeler competition on 17 October 1937. Since 1971 this event has been held annually in cooperation with the Stadtsparkasse (a local bank), but formerly took place in the K\u00f6nigsallee. Since 2006 it has taken place on the Rheinwerft, near the old part of town. This is a fixed date in the city\u2019s calendar of events. About 500 boys regularly participate in this event and since 1971 girls have also taken part. In 2001 the art project Radschl\u00e4ger-Kunst (Cartwheeler Art) was called into life, in which over 100 cartwheeler sculptures have been designed by various artists. The door knocker on the Church of Lambertus functioned as a model for the sculptures that are 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) high, 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) wide and 30 cm (12 in) deep. They were positioned around the city centre. Some of the sculptures have been auctioned off to companies and private owners.\n\n\n=== Christmas market ===\nEvery Christmas, the city of D\u00fcsseldorf uses the city centre to host one of the largest Christmas gatherings in Germany. The Christmas festival occurs every year from 17 November until 23 December. This Christmas fest brings D\u00fcsseldorf a large portion of tourism every year as many people from nearby areas come to the city to drink mulled wine and hot chocolate and watch craftsman blow glass and create art. The event contains many small wooden buildings all clustered in the middle of the city for all the citizens to enjoy. The event, to many visitors, has an old European feel, but is very lively.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nTraditional meals in the region are Rheinischer Sauerbraten (a beef roast and sometimes horse marinated for a few days in vinegar and spices served with gravy and raisins) and Heaven and Earth (Himmel und \u00c4d; black pudding with stewed apples mixed with mashed potatoes). In winter the people like to eat Muscheln Rheinischer Art (Rhenish-style mussels) as well as Reibekuchen (fried potato pancake served with apple sauce). Also a special meal: D\u00fcsseldorfer Senfrostbraten (Steaks roasted with D\u00fcsseldorf mustard on top).\nD\u00fcsseldorf is known for its strong Dijon-like mustard served in a traditional pot called \"Mostertp\u00f6ttche\", which was eternalised in a still life by Vincent van Gogh in 1884.The Rhine Metropolis is one of the most diverse areas in terms of culinary diversity.

Bundesliga in the 2017\u201318 season.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation to World War II ===\nThe earliest roots of the association go back to the establishment of the gymnastics club Turnverein Flingern on 5 May 1895 in the village of Flingern, today one of the eastern quarters of D\u00fcsseldorf. Two other sides figure in the club's early history: D\u00fcsseldorfer Fu\u00dfballklub Spielverein, founded in 1908, and FK Alemania 1911, which was founded in 1911 and became Fortuna 1911 the following year. In mid-1913, these two clubs merged to form D\u00fcsseldorfer Fu\u00dfball-Club Fortuna 1911 which played its debut season in the Westdeutschen Spielverband in 1913\u201314. TV Flingern joined Fortuna to create D\u00fcsseldorfer Turn- und Sportverein Fortuna on 15 November 1919.In the late 1920s, Fortuna won its first honours as a first tier side; it captured a district level Bezirksliga title in 1927, sent its first representative to the Germany national team in 1928 (Ernst Albrecht), and took a second Bezirksliga title in 1929. The team continued to perform well into the 1930s, winning its third and fourth district titles en route to a Western German football championship in 1931 and its greatest success, a German football championship in 1933 against Schalke 04, which was on the verge of becoming the era's dominant side in Germany. Fortuna was the first team to win the title without conceding a goal in the final rounds of the tournament. It beat Vorw\u00e4rts-Rasensport Gleiwitz (9\u20130), Arminia Hannover (3\u20130), Eintracht Frankfurt (4\u20130) and finally Schalke 04 (3\u20130) en route to becoming the first national champion from the industrial Rhine-Ruhr area.\nIn the following season, the club began playing in Gauliga Niederrhein, 1 of 16 top-flight divisions formed in the re-organization of German football under the Third Reich. D\u00fcsseldorf dominated the division through the 1930s as five-time champions between 1936 and 1940, and made losing appearances in the national championship final in 1936 (1\u20132 to 1. FC N\u00fcrnberg) and the final of the Tschammerpokal, the predecessor of today's DFB-Pokal, in 1937 (1\u20132 against Schalke 04). The club was relegated in 1942 but made a prompt return to the top flight the following season. In 1944\u201345, it began play as the combined wartime side Kriegsspielgemeinschaft TSV Fortuna/SC 99 D\u00fcsseldorf with partner D\u00fcsseldorfer Sport Club 1899, but took part in only two matches as Nazi Germany fell before the advance of Allied armies.The most notable players of that era were Paul Janes, Germany's most capped player from 1942 to 1970 (71 caps), German team captain (1939\u20131942) and member of the Breslau Eleven that beat Denmark 8\u20130 in Breslau in 1937 and went on to win 10 of 11 games played during that year; Stanislaus Kobierski, who earned 26 caps and scored Germany's first ever FIFA World Cup goal; Ernst Albrecht; and Jakob Bender.\n\n\n=== Post War era ===\n\nAfter World War II, Allied occupation authorities ordered the dissolution of all sports organizations in Germany. Fortuna was re-formed in 1945 and then played most of their football in the Oberliga West (I) in the years between 1947 and the creation of the Bundesliga, Germany's professional football league, in 1963. It played as a lower-to-mid-table side but did earn three appearances in the DFB-Pokal final in \u2013 1957, 1958 and 1962 \u2013 but was not able to take the prize, losing each of those matches to Bayern Munich, VfB Stuttgart and 1. FC N\u00fcrnberg. It was also during this era that Toni Turek, goalkeeper for Germany's \"Miracle of Bern\" side at the 1954 World Cup; Erich Juskowiak (30 caps and World Cup player in 1958); and later national team coach Jupp Derwall all represented Fortuna.\n\n\n=== 1960s and 1970s ===\nFortuna's performance was not good enough to earn them a place among the original 16 teams chosen for the newly founded Bundesliga in 1963, but the club did manage to play its way into the premier division three years later for a cameo appearance in 1966\u201367. Despite a sensational 2\u20131 away win at recently crowned European Cup Winners' Cup winners Borussia Dortmund in its Bundesliga debut, Fortuna was immediately relegated, though only to return in 1971 for a stay that lasted 16 seasons and included two third-place league finishes (in 1972\u201373 and 1973\u201374). On 9 December 1978, Fortuna recorded a 7\u20131 victory against Bayern Munich, to date the highest away defeat for Bayern in its entire Bundesliga history. In addition, Fortuna continued its prosperous play in the DFB-Pokal, making another three appearances. After losing in its fifth appearance in the final in 1978 against local rivals 1. FC K\u00f6ln (0\u20132), the club finally broke through and came away as champions in 1979, prevailing 1\u20130 against Hertha BSC, then repeating as champions 1980 with 2\u20131 victory against 1. FC K\u00f6ln. During this period, the club established a record for consecutive DFB-Pokal match victories, with 18-straight between 1978 and 1981.\nFortuna is among a group of four teams which have made frequent appearances in the DFB-Pokal final only to come away empty-handed. Like 1. FC Kaiserslautern, Fortuna has just two wins against fives losses. 1. FC K\u00f6ln has four wins and six losses in the Cup final, while Schalke 04 has been frustrated most often, with five wins and seven losses. Four of the D\u00fcsseldorfer's losses were by a single goal and two of those were in extra time.\nThe club's best turn in European competition was in the 1979 European Cup Winners' Cup Final, where it finished as runners-up to Barcelona, losing 4\u20133 in extra time in an exciting finale at Basel. It was the first of four occasions that the Catalan club won the tournament.\nFortuna achieved its success mostly with hometown players like the famous Allofs brothers (Klaus Allofs and Thomas Allofs) or players like Gerd Zewe (440 games in the Bundesliga), Dieter Herzog, Reiner Geye, Wolfgang Seel and Rudi Bommer who joined the team as nearly unknown players and ended as internationals. Between 1960 and 1967, Peter Meyer scored 119 goals in 174 games.\n\n\n=== 1980s to the new century ===\n\nSince its relegation in 1987, Fortuna has bounced back and forth between leagues, spending five more seasons in the Bundesliga in 1989\u201392 and 1995\u201397 and slipping as low as Oberliga Nordrhein (IV) in 2002\u201304. In 2001, the club escaped relegation to tier IV only because two other clubs were denied licenses to play in tier III for financial reasons. Fortuna had its own money problems at the time but have since managed to arrange its finances more or less back into order. Between 2001 and 2003, the club was sponsored by German punk rock band Die Toten Hosen.\n\n\n=== Recent seasons ===\nIn 2008\u201309, Fortuna competed in the newly established 3. Liga, finishing second and gaining automatic promotion to the 2. Bundesliga, where it finished fourth in its comeback season, 2009\u201310. In this season, Fortuna was the only side unbeaten in home-matches in the three top German (nationwide) leagues.\nAfter a promising 2009\u201310 season, the 2010\u201311 season began poorly for Fortuna. After the first six games of the season, the club was in last place, having lost every match. During these first six matches, the club managed to score only two goals \u2013 one of which was an own-goal by the other side. Despite this discouraging start, Fortuna bounced back and finished the season in seventh place. 2011\u201312 began very differently: after the first half of the season, Fortuna was in first place in the table with a remarkable record of 12 wins, 5 draws and 0 losses. The \"Herbstmeister\" title gave the team and the fans hope that this could be the year Fortuna returned to the Bundesliga. The second half of the season was more challenging, as Fortuna was unable to maintain its pace: it suffered four losses and a number of draws, slipping to third place in the final standings. Nonetheless, this was sufficient for them to qualify for the two-game relegation playoff against the third-last place team in the Bundesliga \u2013 Hertha BSC. The first game of the relegation was played on 10 May 2012 in Berlin, with Fortuna winning 2\u20131. Fortuna drew the deciding game which was played on 15 May in D\u00fcsseldorf. Hertha fans, however, threw firecrackers at the field and the players, and one minute before the match ended, overexcited Fortuna fans stormed the field.\nThe promotion to the Bundesliga represented an extraordinary personal achievement for team captain Andreas Lambertz, as he became the first player in German football history to be promoted three times with the same club, from the then fourth-tier Oberliga to the Bundesliga. For striker Sascha R\u00f6sler, it marked the fourth time in his career that he was promoted from the Second Division into the Bundesliga.\nComing with the recent promotion, the club achieved a new record in German football history, becoming the only German club that has been relegated from the Bundesliga down to a fourth-tier league (time period of downfall: 1997\u20132002) and promoted back to the Bundesliga afterwards (time period of uprising: 2004\u20132012).\nFortuna started the 2012\u201313 Bundesliga season strongly: after five games, it was in fifth place in the table and concerns about relegation seemed to have been put to rest. However, Fortuna's 1\u20130 home win over SpVgg Greuther F\u00fcrth on 16 February would prove to be the club's final victory of the season. The season concluded with Fortuna playing in Hannover 96, a match Fortuna lost 0\u20133. This defeat, combined with an FC Augsburg win over Greuther F\u00fcrth and a bizarre and unlikely victory by 1899 Hoffenheim over second-place Borussia Dortmund, resulted in Fortuna dropping two places. Fortuna finished 17th and were again relegated back to the 2. Bundesliga.\nFortuna's relegation was the result not only of this unlikely series of occurrences on the final day of the season, but also a poor conclusion to the year. Of its final eight matches, it did not win a single one; just one win would have secured its position for the following season's Bundesliga. This poor performance contributed to the dismissal of head coach Norbert Meier.Relegation to the 2. Bundesliga led to a period of generally disappointing performance. Fortuna spent the years between 2013 and 2017 in the middle of the table, often battling against relegation and rarely challenging for promotion back to the Bundesliga. During these years, the club went through a series of coaching changes, with Oliver Reck, Frank Kramer, and former player Mike Buskens among others leading the club at various points. Success however remained elusive.\nIn March 2016, Friedhelm Funkel \u2013 a native of Neuss \u2013 took over as coach of Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf. In his first game as coach, Funkel led the club to a 4\u20133 win against 1. FC Kaiserslautern, ending a month-long winless streak. Funkel's start as coach marked the beginning of a period of increased stability and success for Fortuna.\nAt the start of the 2017\u201318 season, two of Fortuna's strongest performers from the previous year, goalkeeper Michael Rensing and forward Ihlas Bebou, were both lost from the club with Rensing suffering two broken ribs and Bebou transferring to Bundesliga side Hannover 96. A further setback was that Funkel's assistant Peter Hermann asked to be released from his contract with Fortuna in order to rejoin his mentor Jupp Heynckes upon his return to FC Bayern. With these three losses, it appeared that the 2017\u201318 season could be difficult for Fortuna. However, the club started extremely strongly: on the fourth day of the season, Fortuna had climbed to first place in the table, with a draw and three wins. For the remainder of the year, they would not drop below third place, benefiting from particularly strong play by Rensing's replacement in goal, Raphael Wolf, newly-acquired Belgian forward Benito Raman, striker Rouwen Hennings, and midfielder Florian Neuhaus. A late-season slump saw Fortuna lose three games in succession in early April, but Fortuna won their next two matches, securing promotion to the Bundesliga. In the final game of the season, with promotion already secured, Fortuna defeated 1. FC N\u00fcrnberg 3:2 on a last-minute goal thereby securing first place and the 2. Division Championship. For coach Friedhelm Funkel, this marks the sixth time he had led a club to promotion\u2014a German record.\nFortuna D\u00fcsseldorf's return to first-division football in 2018\u201319 was greeted with great enthusiasm by their supporters. The first half of the season was marked by strong but inconsistent play. Fortuna played remarkably well against top Bundesliga sides, taking a point from Leipzig and defeating Hoffenheim and first-place Borussia Dortmund. Most encouraging was an away draw against the defending champions Bayern Munich, when Fortuna came back after trailing 2\u20130 and 3\u20131, to secure a 3\u20133 draw in the 93rd minute, with Dodi Lukebakio scored all three of Fortuna's goals. However, Fortuna failed to play with the same consistency and decisiveness against clubs lower in the table, against whom they will battle to avoid relegation, losing to Augsburg, N\u00fcrnberg and Mainz, and only managing a draw against Stuttgart. Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf entered the mid-winter break in 14th place in the table, concluding the first half of the season with three successive wins against Freiburg, Dortmund and Hannover. Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf enjoyed a more consistent second half of the season, with away wins over Augsburg, Hertha Berlin and one of their best performances in recent times, a storming display in a 0-4 win at Schalke 04. A 4-1 win at home to Werder Bremen and a 3-1 victory over Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach were highlights at home, whilst other home wins over VfB Stuttgart, N\u00fcrnberg and a final day defeat of Hannover 96 ensured a 10th place finish in the Bundesliga. This achieved Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf\u2019s highest league finish since the 1989-90 Bundesliga season, where they finished 9th.\n\n\n== Sponsorship ==\nFor the 2017\u201318 season, online sports betting website Tipbet renewed its agreement as Premium Partners of Fortuna.

Bundesliga.\n\n\n== Rivalries and fan culture ==\nFortuna's fiercest rivalry is with 1. FC K\u00f6ln, which stems from the geographic proximity of D\u00fcsseldorf and Cologne as well as the historic rivalry between the two cities. However, in recent seasons the clubs have rarely played in the same division making head-to-head encounters increasingly rare. The 2013\u201314 season marked the last time the two clubs met in competitive matches when both played in the Second Division. For the 2018\u201319 season, Fortuna was promoted to the 1. Bundesliga precisely as 1. FC K\u00f6ln was demoted from the Bundesliga to the Second Division, again avoiding the \u201cRheinland Derby\u201d.\nFortuna\u2019s other historic rivals are Rot-Weiss Essen, Bayer 04 Leverkusen, and Wuppertaler SV. During the 1970s, all four clubs played in the Bundesliga. Both Essen and Wuppertal have since dropped to lower leagues. Bayer Leverkusen, on the other hand, has emerged as a powerful force in the Bundesliga. Leverkusen\u2019s financial support from the Bayer chemical conglomerate has led to many D\u00fcsseldorf fans criticizing the club as \u201cplastic\u201d and inauthentic, without any real tradition. During the seasons when they both played in the Second Division, Fortuna\u2019s matches against MSV Duisburg and Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach were hotly contested and were often referred to as \u201cLower Rhein Derbys\u201d. Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf and Rot-Weiss Essen have played one another 59 times and many fans still regard this as a heated rivalry, but direct matches have been rare in recent years. Fortuna also has inter-city rivalries with D\u00fcsseldorf SC99 and TuRU D\u00fcsseldorf, yet these have also lost their intensity. During the post-war years, no other club within the D\u00fcsseldorf city limits has ever played in a higher division than Fortuna.\nBecause of the dominance of FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen in recent decades, Fortuna also has a competitive rivalry with the Bavarians. Although D\u00fcsseldorf has not mounted a serious challenge for the Bundesliga championship since the early 1970s, matches between Fortuna and FC Bayern have been fiercely contested. In a 1975 match, Bayern led at halftime 4:2, but Fortuna came back to win 6:5. On 9 December 1978, Fortuna defeated FC Bayern 7:1, an outcome which to this day remains FC Bayern\u2019s worst-ever away loss. During the 1985\u201386 season, Fortuna was the only team to win both of its games against the eventual champions from Munich, winning 4:0 and 3:2. \nThe band Die Toten Hosen, many of whose members are enthusiastic fans of Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf, have celebrated the team's success against FC Bayern in their song \"Bayern\" which appears on their album \"Immortal\".\nThe last Bundesliga game was a draw after Munich had led 3\u20131. Fortuna scored two goals, 3: 3 in 10 minutes.\nThe club has a particular strong affiliation with English League One side Ipswich Town, with their supporters making annual visits to see them at their home ground, Portman Road, since 2003. Ipswich fans have also done the same, with some coming to cheer Dusseldorf on at the Merkur Spiel-Arena.Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf enjoys a strong a spirited fan base, and supporters in the \"ultra\" curve of the stadium are well known for their elaborate choreographed displays and enthusiastic support for their club, which occasionally includes the lighting of \u201cBengalos\u201d or fireworks in the stands.\nMembers of the band Die Toten Hosen, including lead singer Campino, are often present at Fortuna matches at home and on the road, and when Fortuna celebrated its recent 2. Division championship in front of thousands of fans at D\u00fcsseldorf's city hall on 14 May 2018, the band appeared with them. The band is also highly regarded by the club for serving as sponsors during the 2001\u201302 and 2002\u201303 seasons, when the club had been relegated to the Regional League and faced financial difficulty.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "wiki": "D\u00fcsseldorf (often Dusseldorf in English sources; UK: , US: , German: [\u02c8d\u028fsl\u0329d\u0254\u0281f] (listen);  Low Franconian and Ripuarian: D\u00fcsseld\u00f6rp ([\u02c8d\u028fsl\u0329d\u0153\u0250\u032fp]); archaic Dutch: Dusseldorp) is the capital and second-largest city of the most populous German state of North Rhine-Westphalia after Cologne, and the seventh-largest city in Germany, with a population of 617,280. At the confluence of the Rhine and its tributary D\u00fcssel, the city lies in the centre of both the Rhine-Ruhr and the Rhineland Metropolitan Regions with the Cologne Bonn Region to its south and the Ruhr to its north. Most of the city lies on the right bank of the Rhine (as opposed to Cologne, whose city centre lies on the river's left bank). The city is the largest in the German Low Franconian dialect area (closely related to Dutch). \"Dorf\" meaning \"village\" in German, the \"-dorf\" suffix (English cognate: thorp) is unusual in the German-speaking area for a settlement of D\u00fcsseldorf's size.\nMercer's 2012 Quality of Living survey ranked D\u00fcsseldorf the sixth most livable city in the world. D\u00fcsseldorf Airport is Germany's third-busiest airport after those of Frankfurt and Munich, serving as the most important international airport for the inhabitants of the densely populated Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area. D\u00fcsseldorf is an international business and financial centre, renowned for its fashion and trade fairs, and is headquarters to one Fortune Global 500 and two DAX companies. Messe D\u00fcsseldorf organises nearly one fifth of premier trade shows. As second largest city of the Rhineland, D\u00fcsseldorf holds Rhenish Carnival celebrations every year in February/March, the D\u00fcsseldorf carnival celebrations being the third most popular in Germany after those held in Cologne and Mainz.There are 22 institutions of higher education in the city including the Heinrich-Heine-Universit\u00e4t D\u00fcsseldorf, the university of applied sciences (Hochschule D\u00fcsseldorf), the academy of arts (Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf) (Joseph Beuys, Emanuel Leutze, August Macke, Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, and Andreas Gursky), and the university of music (Robert-Schumann-Musikhochschule D\u00fcsseldorf). The city is also known for its pioneering influence on electronic/experimental music (Kraftwerk) and its Japanese community.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early development ===\nWhen the Roman Empire was strengthening its position throughout Europe, a few Germanic tribes clung on in marshy territory off the eastern banks of the Rhine. In the 7th and 8th centuries, the odd farming or fishing settlement could be found at the point where the small river D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine. It was from such settlements that the city of D\u00fcsseldorf grew.\n\nThe first written mention of D\u00fcsseldorf (then called Dusseldorp in the local Low Rhenish dialect) dates back to 1135. Under Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa the small town of Kaiserswerth to the north of D\u00fcsseldorf became a well-fortified outpost, where soldiers kept a watchful eye on every movement on the Rhine. Kaiserswerth eventually became a suburb of D\u00fcsseldorf in 1929. In 1186, D\u00fcsseldorf came under the rule of the Counts of Berg. 14 August 1288 is one of the most important dates in the history of D\u00fcsseldorf. On this day the sovereign Count Adolf VIII of Berg granted the village on the banks of the D\u00fcssel town privileges. Before this, a bloody struggle for power had taken place between the Archbishop of Cologne and the count of Berg, culminating in the Battle of Worringen.\n\nThe Archbishop of Cologne's forces were wiped out by the forces of the count of Berg who were supported by citizens and farmers of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf, paving the way for D\u00fcsseldorf's elevation to city status, which is commemorated today by a monument on the Burgplatz. The custom of turning cartwheels is credited to the children of D\u00fcsseldorf. There are variations of the origin of the cartwheeling children. Today the symbol (Der Radschl\u00e4ger) represents the story and every year the D\u00fcsseldorfers celebrate by having a cartwheeling contest. After this battle the relationship between the four cities deteriorated, because they were commercial rivals; it is often said that there is a kind of hostility between the citizens of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf. Today, it finds its expression mainly in a humorous form (especially during the Rhineland Karneval) and in sports.A market square sprang up on the banks of the Rhine and the square was protected by city walls on all four sides. In 1380, the dukes of Berg moved their seat to the town and D\u00fcsseldorf was made regional capital of the Duchy of Berg. During the following centuries several famous landmarks were built, including the Collegiate Church of St Lambertus. In 1609, the ducal line of the United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg died out, and after a virulent struggle over succession, J\u00fclich and Berg fell to the Wittelsbach Counts of Palatinate-Neuburg, who made D\u00fcsseldorf their main domicile, even after they inherited the Electorate of the Palatinate, in 1685, becoming now Prince-electors as Electors Palatine.Under the art-loving Johann Wilhelm II (r. 1690\u20131716), a vast art gallery with a huge selection of paintings and sculptures, were housed in the Stadtschloss (city castle). After his death, the city fell on hard times again, especially after Elector Charles Theodore inherited Bavaria and moved the electoral court to Munich. With him he took the art collection, which became part of what is now the Alte Pinakothek in Munich. Destruction and poverty struck D\u00fcsseldorf after the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon made Berg a Grand Duchy and D\u00fcsseldorf its capital. Johann Devaranne, a leader of Solingen's resistance to Napoleon's conscription decrees, was executed here in 1813. After Napoleon's defeat, the whole Rhineland including Berg was given to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815. The Rhine Province's parliament was established in D\u00fcsseldorf. By the mid-19th century, D\u00fcsseldorf enjoyed a revival thanks to the Industrial Revolution as the city boasted 100,000 inhabitants by 1882; the figure doubled in 1892.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nDuring World War I the Royal Naval Air Service (RNS) undertook the first Entente strategic bombing missions on 22 September 1914, when it bombed the Zeppelin bases in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\nIn 1920, D\u00fcsseldorf became the centre of the General Strike. On 15 April 1920, 45 delegates of the German Miners Union were murdered by the Freikorps.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nThe city was a target of strategic bombing during World War II, particularly during the RAF bombing campaign in 1943 when over 700 bombers were used in a single night. Raids continued late into the war. As part of the campaign against German oil facilities, the RAF raid of 20\u201321 February on the Rhenania Ossag refinery in the Reisholz district of the city halted oil production there. The Allied ground advance into Germany reached D\u00fcsseldorf in mid-April 1945. The United States 97th Infantry Division easily captured the city on 18 April 1945, after the local German Resistance group launched Aktion Rheinland.\n\n\n=== German Federal Republic ===\nIn 1946, D\u00fcsseldorf was made capital of the new federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The city's reconstruction proceeded at a frantic pace and the economic transformation guided D\u00fcsseldorf's economic growth.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Physical geography ===\n\nD\u00fcsseldorf lies at the centre of the Lower Rhine basin, where the delta of the D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine. The city lies on the east side of the Rhine, except District 4 (Oberkassel, Niederkassel, Heerdt and L\u00f6rick).\nAcross the Rhine, the city of Neuss stands on the delta of the Erft. D\u00fcsseldorf lies southwest of the Ruhr urban area, and in the middle of the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region.\nD\u00fcsseldorf is built entirely on alluvium, mud, sand, clay and occasionally gravel. The highest point in D\u00fcsseldorf is the top of Sandberg in the far eastern part of the city (Hubbelrath borough) at 165 metres (541 ft). The lowest point is at the far northern end in Wittlaer borough where the Schwarzbach enters the Rhine, with an average elevation of 28 metres (92 ft).\n\n\n=== Adjacent cities and districts ===\nThe following districts and cities border D\u00fcsseldorf (clockwise starting from the north): the City of Duisburg, the District of Mettmann (Ratingen, Mettmann, Erkrath, Hilden, Langenfeld, and Monheim), and the District of Neuss (Dormagen, Neuss, and Meerbusch).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe city has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb, mild in relation to East Germany).

The wind is calm (defined as being under 2 m/s or 4.5 mph) about 35% of the time, more frequently at night and in the winter.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nWith a population of 612,178 within the city boundaries (31 December 2015), D\u00fcsseldorf is Germany's seventh largest city. Its population surpassed the threshold of 100,000 inhabitants during the height of industrialisation in 1882, and peaked at just over 705,000 in 1962. The city then began to lose residents with many moving into neighbouring municipalities. However, since the late 1990s, the city's population has been slowly rising again.\nA total of 109,883 (18%) of D\u00fcsseldorf's population are foreigners (31 December 2008), the majority of whom come from within Europe (81,742).

Heinrich Heine, whose 200th birthday was celebrated in 1997 and who originally had a proposed memorial in the city dedicated to him; Clara and Robert Schumann; and as Felix Mendelssohn, are the most prominent artists related to the city, which is home to a distinguished Academy of Fine Arts.\nThe D\u00fcsseldorf cultural scene comprises traditional and avant-garde, classical and glamorous. The world-famous state art collection of North Rhine-Westphalia, the highly acclaimed Deutsche Oper am Rhein (opera), and the D\u00fcsseldorfer Schauspielhaus (theatre), artistic home of Gustaf Gr\u00fcndgens, are major elements of D\u00fcsseldorf's reputation as a centre of the fine arts.\n\n\n=== Beer ===\nD\u00fcsseldorf is well known for its Altbier, a hoppy beer which translates as old [style] beer, a reference to the pre-lager brewing method of using a warm top-fermenting yeast like British pale ales. Over time the Alt yeast adjusted to lower temperatures, and the Alt brewers would store or lager the beer after fermentation, leading to a cleaner, crisper beer. The name \"altbier\" first appeared in the 19th century to differentiate the beers of D\u00fcsseldorf from the new pale lager that was gaining a hold on Germany.Brewers in D\u00fcsseldorf used the pale malts that were used for the modern pale lagers, but retained the old (\"alt\") method of using warm fermenting yeasts. The first brewery to use the name Alt was Schumacher which opened in 1838. The founder, Mathias Schumacher, allowed the beer to mature in cool conditions in wooden casks for longer than normal, and laid the foundation for the modern alt \u2013 amber coloured and lagered. The result is a pale beer that has some of the lean dryness of a lager but with fruity notes as well.There are five pub-breweries in D\u00fcsseldorf which brew Altbier on the premises: F\u00fcchschen, Schumacher, Schl\u00fcssel, Uerige and Brauerei K\u00fcrzer. Four of the five are in the historic centre of D\u00fcsseldorf (Altstadt); the other (Schumacher), between the Altstadt and D\u00fcsseldorf Central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), also maintains an establishment in the Altstadt, Im Goldenen Kessel, across the street from Schl\u00fcssel.\nEach (except Brauerei K\u00fcrzer) produces a special, secret, seasonal \"Sticke\" version in small quantities, though the names vary: Schl\u00fcssel spells it \"Stike\", without the \"c\", while Schumacher calls its special beer \"Latzenbier\", meaning \"slat beer\", possibly because the kegs from which it was poured had been stored on raised shelves. F\u00fcchschen's seasonal is its Weihnachtsbier (Christmas beer), available in bottles starting mid-November, and served in the brewpub on Christmas Eve.\n\n\n=== Music and nightlife ===\n\nSince the 1950s the \"Kom(m)\u00f6dchen\" has been one of the most prominent political cabarets of Germany. The city's most famous contribution to the culture of modern popular music is beyond doubt the influential avant-garde electronic band Kraftwerk. Formed by a few D\u00fcsseldorf-born musicians, Kraftwerk is internationally known as the most significant band in the history of post-war German music and as pioneers in electronic music. Other influential musical groups originating from D\u00fcsseldorf include Neu!, formed in 1971 by Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother, after their split from Kraftwerk, and La D\u00fcsseldorf, also formed by Dinger in 1976 shortly after Neu! disbanded. Both groups had a significant influence on a variety of subsequent rock, post-punk, and electronic music artists.Internationally known power metal band Warlock was formed in D\u00fcsseldorf in 1982. Its frontwoman, Doro Pesch, had a successful solo career in Europe and Asia since Warlock ended. The punk band Die Toten Hosen, which is famous around the world, also the most popular singers in Germany Westernhagen and Heino come from D\u00fcsseldorf. The electronic act D.A.F. was formed in the city in 1978, as well as the electronic/industrial pioneers Die Krupps in 1980. Another famous formation is Fehlfarben. Founded in the late 1970s by Peter Hein, Frank Fenstermacher, Kurt Dahlke and Michael Kemner.\nD\u00fcsseldorf appears in several songs, including D\u00fcsseldorf by the British indie band Teleman and W\u00e4rst du doch in D\u00fcsseldorf geblieben by Danish singer Dorthe Kollo.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nD\u00fcsseldorf, Germany is the fashion capital of Germany as it is a major cultural center for the art and fashion scenes. The fashionable clothes trend took root in this city before 1949. 1949 is the date of the first fashion show staged in D\u00fcsseldorf. Fashion trends have occurred as access to more elegant clothing for the general public has been a part of the culture for almost a century. Two times a year an event called the, \u201cVoices of Fashion,\u201d occurs and attracts many people to visit D\u00fcsseldorf to find the latest fashion items. There are famous designers that have made a name for themselves in D\u00fcsseldorf as well. Designers Sabine Schumacher, Peter O. Mahler, and Renate Harvan all design in D\u00fcsseldorf. To keep the creativity and passion for fashion alive in D\u00fcsseldorf everyday there are schools dedicated to fashion design in D\u00fcsseldorf as well. Akademie Mode and Design Institution, Design Department Academy, and Mode Design College are the three prominent fashion schools residing in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n=== Carnival ===\n\nOne of the biggest cultural events in D\u00fcsseldorf is the Karneval (also referred to as the \"fifth season\") which starts every year on 11 November at 11:11 a.m., and reaches its climax on Rosenmontag (Rose Monday), featuring a huge parade through the streets of D\u00fcsseldorf. Karneval ends on Aschermittwoch (Ash Wednesday).\n\n\n=== Cartwheeler of D\u00fcsseldorf ===\n\nThe D\u00fcsseldorfer Radschl\u00e4ger (Boy who does Cartwheels) is said to be the city's oldest tradition. The symbol of the cartwheeler can be found on many souvenirs and various things in D\u00fcsseldorf have the cartwheelers to thank for their names. This tradition was honoured in 1954 by the erection of a fountain, called Cartwheeler's Fountain, on the Burgplatz in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n==== Legends of its origin and history ====\nThe tradition cannot be linked to one specific historical event, instead, there are several stories surrounding the beginnings of the D\u00fcsseldorf Cartwheelers. Probably the most well known version is Battle of Worringen. In the battle of 1288 Count Adolf devastatingly defeated the Archbishop of Cologne. As a consequence of this victory, D\u00fcsseldorf obtained Town privileges. The inhabitants, especially the children ran joyfully on the streets and performed cartwheels.\nAnother story talks about a wedding procession during which one of the wheels of the wedding carriage broke. In order to fend off the threat of bad luck, a boy supposedly jumped to the carriage, took hold of the wheel and thus became a living part of the wheel. Whether the story is about the marriage of Jan Wellem and Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici or the wedding of Margravine Jakobea of Baden and Johann Wilhelm is debatable.\nAnother story gives an account of this wedding between Margrave Jacobe von Baden and Johann Wilhelm, in 1585. According to legend she felt miserable about her marriage, but the cartwheelers who displayed their skills next to her carriage were able to make her smile. Numerous travelers were attracted to the city by great exhibitions \u2013 the forerunner of today's fairs \u2013 between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. During this time the children who did the cart wheeling found out that it was a profitable source of income. The bourgeoisie accepted this in good humour as a symbolic act of local patriotism. In the beginning the lads shouted \"f\u00f6r eene Penning schlage ich das Rad\u201c (cartwheel for a penny). The Jan Wellem monument returned to D\u00fcsseldorf at the end of the Second World War. The procession was accompanied by torches, fanfares and the cartwheeling boys.\n\n\n===== Cartwheelers in the cityscape =====\nCartwheelers can be found by several fountains within the city and near many small landmarks. The most famous is Cartwheeler's Fountain in Burgplatz with an inscription of a quote by Hans M\u00fcller-Schl\u00f6sser: \"Radschl\u00e4ger wolle mer blieve, wie jeck et de Minschen och drieve\u201c (We will always remain cartwheelers, however crazy it drives people.) The fountain was designed by Alfred Zschorsch in 1954 and donated by the  Heimatverein D\u00fcsseldorfer Jonges, which is a club devoted to the maintenance of local and regional traditions. There are other cartwheelers that decorate storm drains and the door knocker on the Church of Lambertus, which was designed by Friedrich Becker. He created the cartwheeler in front of the Schadow Arcades.This tradition has been kept alive by the Alde D\u00fcsseldorfer B\u00fcrgergesellschaft von 1920 e. V., a society founded in 1920, who organized the first cartwheeler competition on 17 October 1937. Since 1971 this event has been held annually in cooperation with the Stadtsparkasse (a local bank), but formerly took place in the K\u00f6nigsallee. Since 2006 it has taken place on the Rheinwerft, near the old part of town. This is a fixed date in the city\u2019s calendar of events. About 500 boys regularly participate in this event and since 1971 girls have also taken part. In 2001 the art project Radschl\u00e4ger-Kunst (Cartwheeler Art) was called into life, in which over 100 cartwheeler sculptures have been designed by various artists. The door knocker on the Church of Lambertus functioned as a model for the sculptures that are 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) high, 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) wide and 30 cm (12 in) deep. They were positioned around the city centre. Some of the sculptures have been auctioned off to companies and private owners.\n\n\n=== Christmas market ===\nEvery Christmas, the city of D\u00fcsseldorf uses the city centre to host one of the largest Christmas gatherings in Germany. The Christmas festival occurs every year from 17 November until 23 December. This Christmas fest brings D\u00fcsseldorf a large portion of tourism every year as many people from nearby areas come to the city to drink mulled wine and hot chocolate and watch craftsman blow glass and create art.

At the confluence of the Rhine and its tributary D\u00fcssel, the city lies in the centre of both the Rhine-Ruhr and the Rhineland Metropolitan Regions with the Cologne Bonn Region to its south and the Ruhr to its north. Most of the city lies on the right bank of the Rhine (as opposed to Cologne, whose city centre lies on the river's left bank). The city is the largest in the German Low Franconian dialect area (closely related to Dutch). \"Dorf\" meaning \"village\" in German, the \"-dorf\" suffix (English cognate: thorp) is unusual in the German-speaking area for a settlement of D\u00fcsseldorf's size.\nMercer's 2012 Quality of Living survey ranked D\u00fcsseldorf the sixth most livable city in the world. D\u00fcsseldorf Airport is Germany's third-busiest airport after those of Frankfurt and Munich, serving as the most important international airport for the inhabitants of the densely populated Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area. D\u00fcsseldorf is an international business and financial centre, renowned for its fashion and trade fairs, and is headquarters to one Fortune Global 500 and two DAX companies. Messe D\u00fcsseldorf organises nearly one fifth of premier trade shows. As second largest city of the Rhineland, D\u00fcsseldorf holds Rhenish Carnival celebrations every year in February/March, the D\u00fcsseldorf carnival celebrations being the third most popular in Germany after those held in Cologne and Mainz.There are 22 institutions of higher education in the city including the Heinrich-Heine-Universit\u00e4t D\u00fcsseldorf, the university of applied sciences (Hochschule D\u00fcsseldorf), the academy of arts (Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf) (Joseph Beuys, Emanuel Leutze, August Macke, Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, and Andreas Gursky), and the university of music (Robert-Schumann-Musikhochschule D\u00fcsseldorf). The city is also known for its pioneering influence on electronic/experimental music (Kraftwerk) and its Japanese community.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early development ===\nWhen the Roman Empire was strengthening its position throughout Europe, a few Germanic tribes clung on in marshy territory off the eastern banks of the Rhine. In the 7th and 8th centuries, the odd farming or fishing settlement could be found at the point where the small river D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine. It was from such settlements that the city of D\u00fcsseldorf grew.\n\nThe first written mention of D\u00fcsseldorf (then called Dusseldorp in the local Low Rhenish dialect) dates back to 1135. Under Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa the small town of Kaiserswerth to the north of D\u00fcsseldorf became a well-fortified outpost, where soldiers kept a watchful eye on every movement on the Rhine. Kaiserswerth eventually became a suburb of D\u00fcsseldorf in 1929. In 1186, D\u00fcsseldorf came under the rule of the Counts of Berg. 14 August 1288 is one of the most important dates in the history of D\u00fcsseldorf. On this day the sovereign Count Adolf VIII of Berg granted the village on the banks of the D\u00fcssel town privileges. Before this, a bloody struggle for power had taken place between the Archbishop of Cologne and the count of Berg, culminating in the Battle of Worringen.\n\nThe Archbishop of Cologne's forces were wiped out by the forces of the count of Berg who were supported by citizens and farmers of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf, paving the way for D\u00fcsseldorf's elevation to city status, which is commemorated today by a monument on the Burgplatz. The custom of turning cartwheels is credited to the children of D\u00fcsseldorf. There are variations of the origin of the cartwheeling children. Today the symbol (Der Radschl\u00e4ger) represents the story and every year the D\u00fcsseldorfers celebrate by having a cartwheeling contest. After this battle the relationship between the four cities deteriorated, because they were commercial rivals; it is often said that there is a kind of hostility between the citizens of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf. Today, it finds its expression mainly in a humorous form (especially during the Rhineland Karneval) and in sports.A market square sprang up on the banks of the Rhine and the square was protected by city walls on all four sides. In 1380, the dukes of Berg moved their seat to the town and D\u00fcsseldorf was made regional capital of the Duchy of Berg. During the following centuries several famous landmarks were built, including the Collegiate Church of St Lambertus. In 1609, the ducal line of the United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg died out, and after a virulent struggle over succession, J\u00fclich and Berg fell to the Wittelsbach Counts of Palatinate-Neuburg, who made D\u00fcsseldorf their main domicile, even after they inherited the Electorate of the Palatinate, in 1685, becoming now Prince-electors as Electors Palatine.Under the art-loving Johann Wilhelm II (r. 1690\u20131716), a vast art gallery with a huge selection of paintings and sculptures, were housed in the Stadtschloss (city castle). After his death, the city fell on hard times again, especially after Elector Charles Theodore inherited Bavaria and moved the electoral court to Munich. With him he took the art collection, which became part of what is now the Alte Pinakothek in Munich. Destruction and poverty struck D\u00fcsseldorf after the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon made Berg a Grand Duchy and D\u00fcsseldorf its capital. Johann Devaranne, a leader of Solingen's resistance to Napoleon's conscription decrees, was executed here in 1813. After Napoleon's defeat, the whole Rhineland including Berg was given to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815. The Rhine Province's parliament was established in D\u00fcsseldorf. By the mid-19th century, D\u00fcsseldorf enjoyed a revival thanks to the Industrial Revolution as the city boasted 100,000 inhabitants by 1882; the figure doubled in 1892.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nDuring World War I the Royal Naval Air Service (RNS) undertook the first Entente strategic bombing missions on 22 September 1914, when it bombed the Zeppelin bases in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\nIn 1920, D\u00fcsseldorf became the centre of the General Strike.

Raids continued late into the war. As part of the campaign against German oil facilities, the RAF raid of 20\u201321 February on the Rhenania Ossag refinery in the Reisholz district of the city halted oil production there. The Allied ground advance into Germany reached D\u00fcsseldorf in mid-April 1945.

Over time the Alt yeast adjusted to lower temperatures, and the Alt brewers would store or lager the beer after fermentation, leading to a cleaner, crisper beer. The name \"altbier\" first appeared in the 19th century to differentiate the beers of D\u00fcsseldorf from the new pale lager that was gaining a hold on Germany.Brewers in D\u00fcsseldorf used the pale malts that were used for the modern pale lagers, but retained the old (\"alt\") method of using warm fermenting yeasts. The first brewery to use the name Alt was Schumacher which opened in 1838. The founder, Mathias Schumacher, allowed the beer to mature in cool conditions in wooden casks for longer than normal, and laid the foundation for the modern alt \u2013 amber coloured and lagered. The result is a pale beer that has some of the lean dryness of a lager but with fruity notes as well.There are five pub-breweries in D\u00fcsseldorf which brew Altbier on the premises: F\u00fcchschen, Schumacher, Schl\u00fcssel, Uerige and Brauerei K\u00fcrzer. Four of the five are in the historic centre of D\u00fcsseldorf (Altstadt); the other (Schumacher), between the Altstadt and D\u00fcsseldorf Central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), also maintains an establishment in the Altstadt, Im Goldenen Kessel, across the street from Schl\u00fcssel.\nEach (except Brauerei K\u00fcrzer) produces a special, secret, seasonal \"Sticke\" version in small quantities, though the names vary: Schl\u00fcssel spells it \"Stike\", without the \"c\", while Schumacher calls its special beer \"Latzenbier\", meaning \"slat beer\", possibly because the kegs from which it was poured had been stored on raised shelves. F\u00fcchschen's seasonal is its Weihnachtsbier (Christmas beer), available in bottles starting mid-November, and served in the brewpub on Christmas Eve.\n\n\n=== Music and nightlife ===\n\nSince the 1950s the \"Kom(m)\u00f6dchen\" has been one of the most prominent political cabarets of Germany. The city's most famous contribution to the culture of modern popular music is beyond doubt the influential avant-garde electronic band Kraftwerk. Formed by a few D\u00fcsseldorf-born musicians, Kraftwerk is internationally known as the most significant band in the history of post-war German music and as pioneers in electronic music. Other influential musical groups originating from D\u00fcsseldorf include Neu!, formed in 1971 by Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother, after their split from Kraftwerk, and La D\u00fcsseldorf, also formed by Dinger in 1976 shortly after Neu! disbanded. Both groups had a significant influence on a variety of subsequent rock, post-punk, and electronic music artists.Internationally known power metal band Warlock was formed in D\u00fcsseldorf in 1982. Its frontwoman, Doro Pesch, had a successful solo career in Europe and Asia since Warlock ended. The punk band Die Toten Hosen, which is famous around the world, also the most popular singers in Germany Westernhagen and Heino come from D\u00fcsseldorf.

Founded in the late 1970s by Peter Hein, Frank Fenstermacher, Kurt Dahlke and Michael Kemner.\nD\u00fcsseldorf appears in several songs, including D\u00fcsseldorf by the British indie band Teleman and W\u00e4rst du doch in D\u00fcsseldorf geblieben by Danish singer Dorthe Kollo.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nD\u00fcsseldorf, Germany is the fashion capital of Germany as it is a major cultural center for the art and fashion scenes. The fashionable clothes trend took root in this city before 1949. 1949 is the date of the first fashion show staged in D\u00fcsseldorf. Fashion trends have occurred as access to more elegant clothing for the general public has been a part of the culture for almost a century. Two times a year an event called the, \u201cVoices of Fashion,\u201d occurs and attracts many people to visit D\u00fcsseldorf to find the latest fashion items. There are famous designers that have made a name for themselves in D\u00fcsseldorf as well. Designers Sabine Schumacher, Peter O. Mahler, and Renate Harvan all design in D\u00fcsseldorf.

Karneval ends on Aschermittwoch (Ash Wednesday).\n\n\n=== Cartwheeler of D\u00fcsseldorf ===\n\nThe D\u00fcsseldorfer Radschl\u00e4ger (Boy who does Cartwheels) is said to be the city's oldest tradition. The symbol of the cartwheeler can be found on many souvenirs and various things in D\u00fcsseldorf have the cartwheelers to thank for their names. This tradition was honoured in 1954 by the erection of a fountain, called Cartwheeler's Fountain, on the Burgplatz in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n==== Legends of its origin and history ====\nThe tradition cannot be linked to one specific historical event, instead, there are several stories surrounding the beginnings of the D\u00fcsseldorf Cartwheelers. Probably the most well known version is Battle of Worringen. In the battle of 1288 Count Adolf devastatingly defeated the Archbishop of Cologne. As a consequence of this victory, D\u00fcsseldorf obtained Town privileges. The inhabitants, especially the children ran joyfully on the streets and performed cartwheels.\nAnother story talks about a wedding procession during which one of the wheels of the wedding carriage broke. In order to fend off the threat of bad luck, a boy supposedly jumped to the carriage, took hold of the wheel and thus became a living part of the wheel. Whether the story is about the marriage of Jan Wellem and Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici or the wedding of Margravine Jakobea of Baden and Johann Wilhelm is debatable.\nAnother story gives an account of this wedding between Margrave Jacobe von Baden and Johann Wilhelm, in 1585. According to legend she felt miserable about her marriage, but the cartwheelers who displayed their skills next to her carriage were able to make her smile. Numerous travelers were attracted to the city by great exhibitions \u2013 the forerunner of today's fairs \u2013 between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. During this time the children who did the cart wheeling found out that it was a profitable source of income. The bourgeoisie accepted this in good humour as a symbolic act of local patriotism. In the beginning the lads shouted \"f\u00f6r eene Penning schlage ich das Rad\u201c (cartwheel for a penny). The Jan Wellem monument returned to D\u00fcsseldorf at the end of the Second World War. The procession was accompanied by torches, fanfares and the cartwheeling boys.\n\n\n===== Cartwheelers in the cityscape =====\nCartwheelers can be found by several fountains within the city and near many small landmarks. The most famous is Cartwheeler's Fountain in Burgplatz with an inscription of a quote by Hans M\u00fcller-Schl\u00f6sser: \"Radschl\u00e4ger wolle mer blieve, wie jeck et de Minschen och drieve\u201c (We will always remain cartwheelers, however crazy it drives people.) The fountain was designed by Alfred Zschorsch in 1954 and donated by the  Heimatverein D\u00fcsseldorfer Jonges, which is a club devoted to the maintenance of local and regional traditions. There are other cartwheelers that decorate storm drains and the door knocker on the Church of Lambertus, which was designed by Friedrich Becker. He created the cartwheeler in front of the Schadow Arcades.This tradition has been kept alive by the Alde D\u00fcsseldorfer B\u00fcrgergesellschaft von 1920 e. V., a society founded in 1920, who organized the first cartwheeler competition on 17 October 1937. Since 1971 this event has been held annually in cooperation with the Stadtsparkasse (a local bank), but formerly took place in the K\u00f6nigsallee. Since 2006 it has taken place on the Rheinwerft, near the old part of town. This is a fixed date in the city\u2019s calendar of events. About 500 boys regularly participate in this event and since 1971 girls have also taken part. In 2001 the art project Radschl\u00e4ger-Kunst (Cartwheeler Art) was called into life, in which over 100 cartwheeler sculptures have been designed by various artists. The door knocker on the Church of Lambertus functioned as a model for the sculptures that are 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) high, 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) wide and 30 cm (12 in) deep. They were positioned around the city centre. Some of the sculptures have been auctioned off to companies and private owners.\n\n\n=== Christmas market ===\nEvery Christmas, the city of D\u00fcsseldorf uses the city centre to host one of the largest Christmas gatherings in Germany. The Christmas festival occurs every year from 17 November until 23 December. This Christmas fest brings D\u00fcsseldorf a large portion of tourism every year as many people from nearby areas come to the city to drink mulled wine and hot chocolate and watch craftsman blow glass and create art. The event contains many small wooden buildings all clustered in the middle of the city for all the citizens to enjoy. The event, to many visitors, has an old European feel, but is very lively.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nTraditional meals in the region are Rheinischer Sauerbraten (a beef roast and sometimes horse marinated for a few days in vinegar and spices served with gravy and raisins) and Heaven and Earth (Himmel und \u00c4d; black pudding with stewed apples mixed with mashed potatoes). In winter the people like to eat Muscheln Rheinischer Art (Rhenish-style mussels) as well as Reibekuchen (fried potato pancake served with apple sauce). Also a special meal: D\u00fcsseldorfer Senfrostbraten (Steaks roasted with D\u00fcsseldorf mustard on top).\nD\u00fcsseldorf is known for its strong Dijon-like mustard served in a traditional pot called \"Mostertp\u00f6ttche\", which was eternalised in a still life by Vincent van Gogh in 1884.The Rhine Metropolis is one of the most diverse areas in terms of culinary diversity.

        "wiki": "D\u00fcsseldorf (often Dusseldorf in English sources; UK: , US: , German: [\u02c8d\u028fsl\u0329d\u0254\u0281f] (listen);  Low Franconian and Ripuarian: D\u00fcsseld\u00f6rp ([\u02c8d\u028fsl\u0329d\u0153\u0250\u032fp]); archaic Dutch: Dusseldorp) is the capital and second-largest city of the most populous German state of North Rhine-Westphalia after Cologne, and the seventh-largest city in Germany, with a population of 617,280. At the confluence of the Rhine and its tributary D\u00fcssel, the city lies in the centre of both the Rhine-Ruhr and the Rhineland Metropolitan Regions with the Cologne Bonn Region to its south and the Ruhr to its north. Most of the city lies on the right bank of the Rhine (as opposed to Cologne, whose city centre lies on the river's left bank). The city is the largest in the German Low Franconian dialect area (closely related to Dutch). \"Dorf\" meaning \"village\" in German, the \"-dorf\" suffix (English cognate: thorp) is unusual in the German-speaking area for a settlement of D\u00fcsseldorf's size.\nMercer's 2012 Quality of Living survey ranked D\u00fcsseldorf the sixth most livable city in the world. D\u00fcsseldorf Airport is Germany's third-busiest airport after those of Frankfurt and Munich, serving as the most important international airport for the inhabitants of the densely populated Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area. D\u00fcsseldorf is an international business and financial centre, renowned for its fashion and trade fairs, and is headquarters to one Fortune Global 500 and two DAX companies. Messe D\u00fcsseldorf organises nearly one fifth of premier trade shows. As second largest city of the Rhineland, D\u00fcsseldorf holds Rhenish Carnival celebrations every year in February/March, the D\u00fcsseldorf carnival celebrations being the third most popular in Germany after those held in Cologne and Mainz.There are 22 institutions of higher education in the city including the Heinrich-Heine-Universit\u00e4t D\u00fcsseldorf, the university of applied sciences (Hochschule D\u00fcsseldorf), the academy of arts (Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf) (Joseph Beuys, Emanuel Leutze, August Macke, Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, and Andreas Gursky), and the university of music (Robert-Schumann-Musikhochschule D\u00fcsseldorf). The city is also known for its pioneering influence on electronic/experimental music (Kraftwerk) and its Japanese community.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early development ===\nWhen the Roman Empire was strengthening its position throughout Europe, a few Germanic tribes clung on in marshy territory off the eastern banks of the Rhine. In the 7th and 8th centuries, the odd farming or fishing settlement could be found at the point where the small river D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine. It was from such settlements that the city of D\u00fcsseldorf grew.\n\nThe first written mention of D\u00fcsseldorf (then called Dusseldorp in the local Low Rhenish dialect) dates back to 1135. Under Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa the small town of Kaiserswerth to the north of D\u00fcsseldorf became a well-fortified outpost, where soldiers kept a watchful eye on every movement on the Rhine. Kaiserswerth eventually became a suburb of D\u00fcsseldorf in 1929. In 1186, D\u00fcsseldorf came under the rule of the Counts of Berg. 14 August 1288 is one of the most important dates in the history of D\u00fcsseldorf. On this day the sovereign Count Adolf VIII of Berg granted the village on the banks of the D\u00fcssel town privileges. Before this, a bloody struggle for power had taken place between the Archbishop of Cologne and the count of Berg, culminating in the Battle of Worringen.\n\nThe Archbishop of Cologne's forces were wiped out by the forces of the count of Berg who were supported by citizens and farmers of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf, paving the way for D\u00fcsseldorf's elevation to city status, which is commemorated today by a monument on the Burgplatz. The custom of turning cartwheels is credited to the children of D\u00fcsseldorf. There are variations of the origin of the cartwheeling children. Today the symbol (Der Radschl\u00e4ger) represents the story and every year the D\u00fcsseldorfers celebrate by having a cartwheeling contest. After this battle the relationship between the four cities deteriorated, because they were commercial rivals; it is often said that there is a kind of hostility between the citizens of Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf. Today, it finds its expression mainly in a humorous form (especially during the Rhineland Karneval) and in sports.A market square sprang up on the banks of the Rhine and the square was protected by city walls on all four sides. In 1380, the dukes of Berg moved their seat to the town and D\u00fcsseldorf was made regional capital of the Duchy of Berg. During the following centuries several famous landmarks were built, including the Collegiate Church of St Lambertus. In 1609, the ducal line of the United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg died out, and after a virulent struggle over succession, J\u00fclich and Berg fell to the Wittelsbach Counts of Palatinate-Neuburg, who made D\u00fcsseldorf their main domicile, even after they inherited the Electorate of the Palatinate, in 1685, becoming now Prince-electors as Electors Palatine.Under the art-loving Johann Wilhelm II (r. 1690\u20131716), a vast art gallery with a huge selection of paintings and sculptures, were housed in the Stadtschloss (city castle). After his death, the city fell on hard times again, especially after Elector Charles Theodore inherited Bavaria and moved the electoral court to Munich. With him he took the art collection, which became part of what is now the Alte Pinakothek in Munich. Destruction and poverty struck D\u00fcsseldorf after the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon made Berg a Grand Duchy and D\u00fcsseldorf its capital. Johann Devaranne, a leader of Solingen's resistance to Napoleon's conscription decrees, was executed here in 1813. After Napoleon's defeat, the whole Rhineland including Berg was given to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815. The Rhine Province's parliament was established in D\u00fcsseldorf. By the mid-19th century, D\u00fcsseldorf enjoyed a revival thanks to the Industrial Revolution as the city boasted 100,000 inhabitants by 1882; the figure doubled in 1892.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nDuring World War I the Royal Naval Air Service (RNS) undertook the first Entente strategic bombing missions on 22 September 1914, when it bombed the Zeppelin bases in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\nIn 1920, D\u00fcsseldorf became the centre of the General Strike. On 15 April 1920, 45 delegates of the German Miners Union were murdered by the Freikorps.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nThe city was a target of strategic bombing during World War II, particularly during the RAF bombing campaign in 1943 when over 700 bombers were used in a single night. Raids continued late into the war. As part of the campaign against German oil facilities, the RAF raid of 20\u201321 February on the Rhenania Ossag refinery in the Reisholz district of the city halted oil production there. The Allied ground advance into Germany reached D\u00fcsseldorf in mid-April 1945. The United States 97th Infantry Division easily captured the city on 18 April 1945, after the local German Resistance group launched Aktion Rheinland.\n\n\n=== German Federal Republic ===\nIn 1946, D\u00fcsseldorf was made capital of the new federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The city's reconstruction proceeded at a frantic pace and the economic transformation guided D\u00fcsseldorf's economic growth.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Physical geography ===\n\nD\u00fcsseldorf lies at the centre of the Lower Rhine basin, where the delta of the D\u00fcssel flows into the Rhine. The city lies on the east side of the Rhine, except District 4 (Oberkassel, Niederkassel, Heerdt and L\u00f6rick).\nAcross the Rhine, the city of Neuss stands on the delta of the Erft. D\u00fcsseldorf lies southwest of the Ruhr urban area, and in the middle of the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region.\nD\u00fcsseldorf is built entirely on alluvium, mud, sand, clay and occasionally gravel. The highest point in D\u00fcsseldorf is the top of Sandberg in the far eastern part of the city (Hubbelrath borough) at 165 metres (541 ft). The lowest point is at the far northern end in Wittlaer borough where the Schwarzbach enters the Rhine, with an average elevation of 28 metres (92 ft).\n\n\n=== Adjacent cities and districts ===\nThe following districts and cities border D\u00fcsseldorf (clockwise starting from the north): the City of Duisburg, the District of Mettmann (Ratingen, Mettmann, Erkrath, Hilden, Langenfeld, and Monheim), and the District of Neuss (Dormagen, Neuss, and Meerbusch).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe city has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb, mild in relation to East Germany). Like the rest of the lower Rhineland, D\u00fcsseldorf experiences moderate winters with little snowfall and mild to warm summers. The average annual temperature is 10.6 \u00b0C (51 \u00b0F) with an average yearly precipitation of 797 millimetres (31 in). The dominant wind direction is from the west with velocities in the range of 3 to 4 m/s (7\u20139 mph), with gusts of 3.5 \u22124.8 m/s (8\u201310.7 mph). The wind is calm (defined as being under 2 m/s or 4.5 mph) about 35% of the time, more frequently at night and in the winter.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nWith a population of 612,178 within the city boundaries (31 December 2015), D\u00fcsseldorf is Germany's seventh largest city. Its population surpassed the threshold of 100,000 inhabitants during the height of industrialisation in 1882, and peaked at just over 705,000 in 1962. The city then began to lose residents with many moving into neighbouring municipalities. However, since the late 1990s, the city's population has been slowly rising again.\nA total of 109,883 (18%) of D\u00fcsseldorf's population are foreigners (31 December 2008), the majority of whom come from within Europe (81,742). The largest national minorities are Turks, Greeks, and Poles. D\u00fcsseldorf and its surroundings have the third-largest Japanese community in Europe and the largest in Germany (about 11,000 people). D\u00fcsseldorf has the third-largest Jewish community in Germany, with about 7,000 members.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Mayors ===\n\n\n=== Districts ===\n\nSince 1975, D\u00fcsseldorf is divided into ten administrative districts. Each district (Bezirk) has its own elected district council (Bezirksvertretung) and its own district mayor (Bezirksvorsteher). The district councils are advisory only. Each district is further subdivided into boroughs. There are 50 boroughs in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nD\u00fcsseldorf has become one of the top telecommunications centres in Germany.

It is obligatory to carry out any journeys to destinations in the city and directly neighbouring cities.\n\n\n=== Carsharing ===\nIn addition to stationary car sharing, where vehicles must be returned to their original location after use, socalled One-way carsharing vehicles have also been available for hire since 2012. These vehicles, which can be parked anywhere where parking is normally allowed within D\u00fcsseldorf, can be rented from Car2go, Greenwheels, Stadtmobil and DriveNow.\n\n\n=== Autobahn ===\nNorth Rhine-Westphalia has the densest network of autobahns in Germany and D\u00fcsseldorf is directly accessible via the A3, A44, A46, A52, A57, A59 and A524.\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nD\u00fcsseldorf is connected to some national and international cycling paths, including EV15 The Rhine Cycle Route.\nThe city of D\u00fcsseldorf is a member of the German North Rhine-Westphalia District, Municipality and City Friends of Pedestrians and Cyclists Working Group, who bestowed upon D\u00fcsseldorf the title of \"Friend of Cyclists City\" in 2007, although the city still has a few gaps in the network of cycle paths in the eyes of many of its citizens.\n\n\n== Culture and recreation ==\nElector Jan Wellem and his wife Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici of Tuscany, were patrons of D\u00fcsseldorf's first significant cultural activities in the 17th and 18th centuries. Heinrich Heine, whose 200th birthday was celebrated in 1997 and who originally had a proposed memorial in the city dedicated to him; Clara and Robert Schumann; and as Felix Mendelssohn, are the most prominent artists related to the city, which is home to a distinguished Academy of Fine Arts.\nThe D\u00fcsseldorf cultural scene comprises traditional and avant-garde, classical and glamorous. The world-famous state art collection of North Rhine-Westphalia, the highly acclaimed Deutsche Oper am Rhein (opera), and the D\u00fcsseldorfer Schauspielhaus (theatre), artistic home of Gustaf Gr\u00fcndgens, are major elements of D\u00fcsseldorf's reputation as a centre of the fine arts.\n\n\n=== Beer ===\nD\u00fcsseldorf is well known for its Altbier, a hoppy beer which translates as old [style] beer, a reference to the pre-lager brewing method of using a warm top-fermenting yeast like British pale ales. Over time the Alt yeast adjusted to lower temperatures, and the Alt brewers would store or lager the beer after fermentation, leading to a cleaner, crisper beer. The name \"altbier\" first appeared in the 19th century to differentiate the beers of D\u00fcsseldorf from the new pale lager that was gaining a hold on Germany.Brewers in D\u00fcsseldorf used the pale malts that were used for the modern pale lagers, but retained the old (\"alt\") method of using warm fermenting yeasts. The first brewery to use the name Alt was Schumacher which opened in 1838. The founder, Mathias Schumacher, allowed the beer to mature in cool conditions in wooden casks for longer than normal, and laid the foundation for the modern alt \u2013 amber coloured and lagered. The result is a pale beer that has some of the lean dryness of a lager but with fruity notes as well.There are five pub-breweries in D\u00fcsseldorf which brew Altbier on the premises: F\u00fcchschen, Schumacher, Schl\u00fcssel, Uerige and Brauerei K\u00fcrzer. Four of the five are in the historic centre of D\u00fcsseldorf (Altstadt); the other (Schumacher), between the Altstadt and D\u00fcsseldorf Central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), also maintains an establishment in the Altstadt, Im Goldenen Kessel, across the street from Schl\u00fcssel.\nEach (except Brauerei K\u00fcrzer) produces a special, secret, seasonal \"Sticke\" version in small quantities, though the names vary: Schl\u00fcssel spells it \"Stike\", without the \"c\", while Schumacher calls its special beer \"Latzenbier\", meaning \"slat beer\", possibly because the kegs from which it was poured had been stored on raised shelves. F\u00fcchschen's seasonal is its Weihnachtsbier (Christmas beer), available in bottles starting mid-November, and served in the brewpub on Christmas Eve.\n\n\n=== Music and nightlife ===\n\nSince the 1950s the \"Kom(m)\u00f6dchen\" has been one of the most prominent political cabarets of Germany. The city's most famous contribution to the culture of modern popular music is beyond doubt the influential avant-garde electronic band Kraftwerk. Formed by a few D\u00fcsseldorf-born musicians, Kraftwerk is internationally known as the most significant band in the history of post-war German music and as pioneers in electronic music. Other influential musical groups originating from D\u00fcsseldorf include Neu!, formed in 1971 by Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother, after their split from Kraftwerk, and La D\u00fcsseldorf, also formed by Dinger in 1976 shortly after Neu! disbanded. Both groups had a significant influence on a variety of subsequent rock, post-punk, and electronic music artists.Internationally known power metal band Warlock was formed in D\u00fcsseldorf in 1982. Its frontwoman, Doro Pesch, had a successful solo career in Europe and Asia since Warlock ended.

The fashionable clothes trend took root in this city before 1949. 1949 is the date of the first fashion show staged in D\u00fcsseldorf. Fashion trends have occurred as access to more elegant clothing for the general public has been a part of the culture for almost a century. Two times a year an event called the, \u201cVoices of Fashion,\u201d occurs and attracts many people to visit D\u00fcsseldorf to find the latest fashion items. There are famous designers that have made a name for themselves in D\u00fcsseldorf as well. Designers Sabine Schumacher, Peter O. Mahler, and Renate Harvan all design in D\u00fcsseldorf. To keep the creativity and passion for fashion alive in D\u00fcsseldorf everyday there are schools dedicated to fashion design in D\u00fcsseldorf as well. Akademie Mode and Design Institution, Design Department Academy, and Mode Design College are the three prominent fashion schools residing in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n=== Carnival ===\n\nOne of the biggest cultural events in D\u00fcsseldorf is the Karneval (also referred to as the \"fifth season\") which starts every year on 11 November at 11:11 a.m., and reaches its climax on Rosenmontag (Rose Monday), featuring a huge parade through the streets of D\u00fcsseldorf. Karneval ends on Aschermittwoch (Ash Wednesday).\n\n\n=== Cartwheeler of D\u00fcsseldorf ===\n\nThe D\u00fcsseldorfer Radschl\u00e4ger (Boy who does Cartwheels) is said to be the city's oldest tradition. The symbol of the cartwheeler can be found on many souvenirs and various things in D\u00fcsseldorf have the cartwheelers to thank for their names. This tradition was honoured in 1954 by the erection of a fountain, called Cartwheeler's Fountain, on the Burgplatz in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n==== Legends of its origin and history ====\nThe tradition cannot be linked to one specific historical event, instead, there are several stories surrounding the beginnings of the D\u00fcsseldorf Cartwheelers. Probably the most well known version is Battle of Worringen. In the battle of 1288 Count Adolf devastatingly defeated the Archbishop of Cologne. As a consequence of this victory, D\u00fcsseldorf obtained Town privileges. The inhabitants, especially the children ran joyfully on the streets and performed cartwheels.\nAnother story talks about a wedding procession during which one of the wheels of the wedding carriage broke. In order to fend off the threat of bad luck, a boy supposedly jumped to the carriage, took hold of the wheel and thus became a living part of the wheel. Whether the story is about the marriage of Jan Wellem and Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici or the wedding of Margravine Jakobea of Baden and Johann Wilhelm is debatable.\nAnother story gives an account of this wedding between Margrave Jacobe von Baden and Johann Wilhelm, in 1585. According to legend she felt miserable about her marriage, but the cartwheelers who displayed their skills next to her carriage were able to make her smile. Numerous travelers were attracted to the city by great exhibitions \u2013 the forerunner of today's fairs \u2013 between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. During this time the children who did the cart wheeling found out that it was a profitable source of income. The bourgeoisie accepted this in good humour as a symbolic act of local patriotism. In the beginning the lads shouted \"f\u00f6r eene Penning schlage ich das Rad\u201c (cartwheel for a penny). The Jan Wellem monument returned to D\u00fcsseldorf at the end of the Second World War. The procession was accompanied by torches, fanfares and the cartwheeling boys.\n\n\n===== Cartwheelers in the cityscape =====\nCartwheelers can be found by several fountains within the city and near many small landmarks. The most famous is Cartwheeler's Fountain in Burgplatz with an inscription of a quote by Hans M\u00fcller-Schl\u00f6sser: \"Radschl\u00e4ger wolle mer blieve, wie jeck et de Minschen och drieve\u201c (We will always remain cartwheelers, however crazy it drives people.) The fountain was designed by Alfred Zschorsch in 1954 and donated by the  Heimatverein D\u00fcsseldorfer Jonges, which is a club devoted to the maintenance of local and regional traditions. There are other cartwheelers that decorate storm drains and the door knocker on the Church of Lambertus, which was designed by Friedrich Becker. He created the cartwheeler in front of the Schadow Arcades.This tradition has been kept alive by the Alde D\u00fcsseldorfer B\u00fcrgergesellschaft von 1920 e. V., a society founded in 1920, who organized the first cartwheeler competition on 17 October 1937. Since 1971 this event has been held annually in cooperation with the Stadtsparkasse (a local bank), but formerly took place in the K\u00f6nigsallee. Since 2006 it has taken place on the Rheinwerft, near the old part of town. This is a fixed date in the city\u2019s calendar of events. About 500 boys regularly participate in this event and since 1971 girls have also taken part. In 2001 the art project Radschl\u00e4ger-Kunst (Cartwheeler Art) was called into life, in which over 100 cartwheeler sculptures have been designed by various artists. The door knocker on the Church of Lambertus functioned as a model for the sculptures that are 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) high, 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) wide and 30 cm (12 in) deep. They were positioned around the city centre. Some of the sculptures have been auctioned off to companies and private owners.\n\n\n=== Christmas market ===\nEvery Christmas, the city of D\u00fcsseldorf uses the city centre to host one of the largest Christmas gatherings in Germany. The Christmas festival occurs every year from 17 November until 23 December. This Christmas fest brings D\u00fcsseldorf a large portion of tourism every year as many people from nearby areas come to the city to drink mulled wine and hot chocolate and watch craftsman blow glass and create art. The event contains many small wooden buildings all clustered in the middle of the city for all the citizens to enjoy. The event, to many visitors, has an old European feel, but is very lively.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nTraditional meals in the region are Rheinischer Sauerbraten (a beef roast and sometimes horse marinated for a few days in vinegar and spices served with gravy and raisins) and Heaven and Earth (Himmel und \u00c4d; black pudding with stewed apples mixed with mashed potatoes). In winter the people like to eat Muscheln Rheinischer Art (Rhenish-style mussels) as well as Reibekuchen (fried potato pancake served with apple sauce). Also a special meal: D\u00fcsseldorfer Senfrostbraten (Steaks roasted with D\u00fcsseldorf mustard on top).\nD\u00fcsseldorf is known for its strong Dijon-like mustard served in a traditional pot called \"Mostertp\u00f6ttche\", which was eternalised in a still life by Vincent van Gogh in 1884.The Rhine Metropolis is one of the most diverse areas in terms of culinary diversity. D\u00fcsseldorf, with the third largest Japanese community in Europe, not only provides a wide range of culinary cuisine but also has a solid foundation of Authentic Asian food in the city.

Along with a broad range of diverse cultural cuisine, D\u00fcsseldorf is also home to various Michelin starred restaurants that are world renowned.Halve Hahn \u2013 this dish is made from a half a double rye roll, which is another of the specialties of D\u00fcsseldorf, buttered, with a thick slice of aged Gouda cheese, onions, mustard, ground paprika and sour pickles.\nHimmel un Aad \u2013 a dish of mashed potatoes and apples along with slices of blutwurst.

The rivalry includes carnival parades, football, ice hockey and beer. People in Cologne prefer K\u00f6lsch while people in D\u00fcsseldorf prefer Alt. Waiters and patrons will \"scorn\" and make a \"mockery\" of people who order Alt beer in Cologne and K\u00f6lsch in D\u00fcsseldorf.

        "wiki": "D\u00fcsseldorf-Hafen is an urban borough of D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, located on the river Rhine and the location of the city's docks.\nThe borough covers 3.85 km2 and is predominantly commercial and industrial in nature, with a very small residential population. It had 212 residents in the year 2000, making it the D\u00fcsseldorf borough with the lowest population density.\nThe docks prospered for decades but lost much of their trade when Mannesmann closed its nearby pipe factory. As a result the eastern part of the docks started to be redeveloped, attracting businesses in the service sector such as media, design and fashion companies. One of the first new residents to the so-called Media Harbour was Westdeutscher Rundfunk with its current affairs TV and radio studios. D\u00fcsseldorf local radio station Antenne D\u00fcsseldorf is also based in the harbour area. One of the largest cinemas of D\u00fcsseldorf is in the Hafen. The Landtag (State parliament) of North Rhine-Westphalia and the Rheinturm are situated right next to the harbour.\nWithin the Hafen district is the Neuer Zollhof an ensemble of three warped-looking buildings by architect Frank Gehry and other postmodernist buildings. There are also many restaurants, bars, and a few clubs, which make the Hafen a prominent lifestyle district. \nThe western part of the area still has actively used docks for barges that transport materials on the Rhine. There are plans for further redevelopment with the construction of high end apartment buildings.\nIn 2003 the port company merged with the port of Neuss on the opposite bank of the Rhine to form Neuss-D\u00fcsseldorfer H\u00e4fen GmbH & Co. KG.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNeuss D\u00fcsseldorfer H\u00e4fen, History (German)\nCommunal Administration, Der Medienhafen (German)\nCommunal Administration, District Mayor (German)This article is based on a translation of an article from the German Wikipedia.",

          "We came here from Cologne by a regional train which only took 20 mins. Entry to the palace is by guided tour only, but is worth it as the rooms are stunning. There was an English tour we told at 3:15 that day, but seeing as we arrived around 1 we tagged onto a German tour and",

          "On a lazy and sunny Sunday we visited the castle. Parking is a bit strange, where do I leave my car? Once on the premises we did not buy tickets for the tour. Strolled around and follow the mass towards the river. Nice walk, approx 10 min but you can easily extend, lanes enough",

          "The tour is only in German and went well over an hour - which is a lot of time to not understand- if I were just seeing the rooms and reading the fact sheet, I could have done it in 15 mins. But, the house is well preserved and has nice gardens and water features- its a good way",
          "We visited the castle late spring, and we were not disappointed. We went to the cafe at the main entrance where we enjoyed ice-coffee (with ice-cream) and then went for a walk throughout the castle. The areas nearest to the main building featured back-yard gardens with large",

          "The beautiful park is worth to be visited. From here it's only a few meters to the river Rhine. The castle itself is not that spectacular, so no need to buy an entrance ticket. From Benrath Station it's just 15 minutes to Dusseldorf Main Station.",
          "Visited this 'palace' when staying in Dusseldorf. There was a wedding taking place so no tour of the building itself. The gardens were in need of a lot of attention, very weedy, patchy grass, etc - basically i wouldn't bother - i've been to many, many nicer places.",

          "I arrived expecting to tour the ch\u00e2teau but it was not obvious that you could - I gather there is a ticket office to the far right of the buildings which are in 3 parts. It would have cost 14 euros to do the 2 museums and have guided tour in German which seems very steep",
          "We went during the middle of the week so it was very quiet and peaceful (according to the locals it's normally busy during the weekends). Definite worth a visit, but I recommend making time to spend at least an hour so you can calmy walk around and visit the nearby lake",
          "Lovely walks through the gardens. Didn't go into the scloss but actually didn't feel the need. Don't use the cafe, walk into Benrath and near the tram stop is a beautiful little cafe with scrumptious cakes and coffe at an exceptionally reasonable price.",

          "The palace is set in a tranquil lake and garden a little away from the city. Its beautiful and worth spending a couple of hours.",
          "Nice palace- worthy a visit if you are in Dusseldorf. The garden is also very beautiful and very well maintained. The lake , the fountain and the garden...overall a peaceful place to spend 3-4 hours. There is a fee for the museum though.",

          "Let me start by saying that if I could have a chance to go back to Dusseldorf - the first place, where I would go again is a garden palace - Schloss Benrath. When we were visiting the palace, we had to buy tickets for the entrance to it. We were also given an opportunity to",
          "Most places like this that I have been to like this have tons of people, but we actually saw very few visitors when we toured Schloss Benrath. It's not as well maintained as some palaces but still a neat place to visit. The gardens are quite pretty. If you plan on visiting",
          "Its a palace with sumptuous interior and a huge park with water bodies on one side and a beautiful pond on the other. Good place to hold weddings. I was fortunate to see a Bride dressed in beautiful White dress here on my visit to this place. In Spring this place looks like",
          "This place is not too far from Dusseldorf. There are museums and a coffee shop inside but we only walked around the park which is located at the rear. The gardens and surrounding are all well kept and maintained.",
          "Took my parents visiting from the UK and it was my first visit too. Easy access from the centre of Dusseldorf via the 701 tram that drops you right on the doorstep. The Schloss is actually a summer pleasure palace that is very well preserved and presented. Entrance is a",
          "Really beautiful castle, if youhave time absolutely visit it. Expect lots of Germans running around and ruining your pictures :)",
          "A wonderful day out with lots to see and do. Lovely walks and gardens. Easily accessible by tran public transport.",
          "Even though Benrath is a bit further away from the city center, it is a great place to walk around or have picnic in during a sunny day. It can be reached in around thirty to forty minutes from the center and it is definetely worth visiting.",
          "Somewhen in internet I found that it opens in 10: 00 so arrived timely. Actually it opens in 11:00. Till than we explored the gardens. They were free and OK for February. Guided tour was in English as we were lucky enaugh to be the only guests, otherwise it would be in German.",
          "The ticket-meister seemed surprised our Dusseldorf Card got us on the palace tour for free, and so were we. We arrived at 11:30am, and the next tour in English was due to start at midday, so we strolled around the lake while we waited. My wife, I, and the knowledgable",
          "Based on reviews we had a plan to spend almost the whole day at the Schloss Benrath and Park. Unfortunately, our visit was significantly shorter. Start with location of the Schloss. It took about 25-30 mins from Dusseldorf Hbf to get to the palace by U74 followed by tram 701",
          "It is just a beautiful place to see and feel history. Lovely monuments great gardens and immaculate lawns. always love to ride my bike around the area and so close to the rhine as well.",
          "Lovely little castle with a huge garden, mostly park. You can walk on the grass, have a picnic, stroll with your bike by the fountain or just walk and admire. Before entering the garden, onthe right side is a souvenir shop with many, many nice things to remind you of your visit",
          "A little bit far from the city center. In winter it works till 5 p.m. We came at 4:20, the doors were closed. It's a pity. The castle seems to be rather luxurious in Rococo style. The park is nice but unfortunately not illuminated. We couldn't walk as it was getting dark. I",
          "Nice visit to fill in an afternoon away from the hustle and bustle of city centre. Pleasant trip with a guide who really did very we'll presenting a bi lingual tour. Easy access from city centre by tram ( 28 mins) gardens would be superb in summer months. Signage not great on",
          "Going here in December might not have been the best time. We enjoyed the Gardens but I am sure they would be much nicer in summer or spring. it was a nice place to have a walk and to look at one of Karl Theodor's Schlosses. It is literally a pink palace, but as compared to other",
          "Interesting tour, but rather brief - you only get to see a selection of rooms. Gardens would be lovely in summer",
          "I have been here several times now. Whenever family visits from the states we always visit here. The tour of the castle itself is beautiful and the guides have been very knowledgeable. Officially they don't have a tour in English, but every time I have been the guide also",
          "It is well worth travelling out here from the centre of Dussledorf to visit this palace. It is beautifully situated with two low buildings on either side of the palace and a lake in front. There is a lovely park, mostly quite wild, apart from a long canal-like water feature. Our",
          "The Benrath Castle is advertised in many traveling guides and tourist web sites. However, there is not much to see about the castle itself. There is a little museum store and a guided tour that you can take to see the interior of the castle. However, what's really spectacular is",
          "It is an ideal attraction for a sunny weekend. The Benrather Schloss is the summer residence of a German king with a big pond in the front and an elaborate old park in the back. There is a playground for the lille children and a array of very big old trees arranged around a star",
          "You can only go round the main palace as part of a tour. This was only available in German. A poorly written sheet of A4 was available in English which was brief and gave very poor information. They should have audible tours available in the range of european languages if they",
          "Enjoyable park to visit, nice walks and good place to watch people enjoying a nice afternoon. Easily reachable by tram. The freak storm that hit Dusseldorf in June downed a lot of old big trees in public parks. Because of that they had to close off a large part of the forested",
          "I went to the Schloss Benrath on the local tram. It was very easy to get to. Tours take place hourly to see the inside. However photos are forbidden inside. Which is a real shame as the inside is absolutely stunning. The tour was very interesting. I would recommend it. It is",
          "The gardens are beautiful. Walk to the Rhine River. Parking can be difficult. Take the tour of the castle or just sit in the caf\u00e9 and watch the passers by.",
          "Pink summer palace. Large summer house and gardens, museum and caf\u00e9. Very Baroque building with lovely architecture. We had sunshine and it was a really pretty place to see.",
          "I visited the Schloss on a beautiful sunny Sunday morning and walked through the numerous gardens and listened to music being played in corners and was taken back to a different world",
          "The grounds seem to be a public park so you can take a bus, tram or Ubahn to the stop right outside the entrance and wander around the grounds. If you want to go in there are tours available. Take transit and have a nice walk around, while there wander down the street a few",
          "Lovely gardens,interesting guided tour in English.Lots to see and easy to get to by S Bahn.Outdoor cafe.",
          "Its a very pretty building in pink with a fountain outside. Nice walks with nice gardens /pretty flowers.I did not do the tour as it was in German and all the writing was in German so thought I would explore the grounds instead. Good for photographs but not your typical English",
          "the Benrather Schloss never fails to excel with perfectly neat parks and clean picknick areas. Visit the flower and herb gardens if you admire nature",
          "This is a good place to have some quiet alone time. The Benrath palace is a nice building with a beautiful and serene park behind it. The place is exceptionally clean and the park is well maintained. Many people were walking and jogging in the premises. The museum was closed",
          "so beautiful and clean park you can imagine as you are a princess and take a long walk through the park and old forest",
          "Coming back to this place after 9 years - it was great to see, but unfortunately the recent storm had caused a lot of damage - the Schloss is worth a visit especially with all its guided tours - try it out!!!",
          "We visited this place on a quiet mid week morning and were not disappointed. Using our D - Dusseldorf visititor card we gained a healthy 40% discount on our entrance tickets for both the Palace tour and the 2 museums. (Note: no ticket is required to walk the grounds and",
          "We visited on Wed morning and found out that the wedding is going on and closed for public until 14:00. That was disappointing and we could only go around the garden which was still beautiful. They said that Wed mornings tend to be booked out for weddings so check it out before",
          "I find it amazing how lords and people from the higher socialeconomy class used to live in so nice places with gardens-individual forests miles away! Everything is so green and I loved it! Amazing place to walk, run or enjoy your day! But It is so sad how the weather conditions",
          "A tranquil oasis of beauty and elegance....Last time I was here was 10 years ago, but it had the same atmosphere now as back then. I love it.",
          "I visited many palaces in Germany and all of them are nice, quiet and clean with tens of thousands square meters of gardens and parks. Benrath palaces is no exception but it is a little more special as in one end of it you'll also find the Rhine banks. For me it certainly worth",
          "Loved the gardens very extensive and popular with lots of locals. The schloss was closed till later in the day as there was a wedding being held there. Lovely setting.. Cafe food and coffee very good",

          "We took some out of town visitors here for a visit of a schloss without having to go out of town. The tour was awesome. Our tour was in German, but the guide stopped to repeat it in English. (I can't say that all guides will do that, but ours did.) It is a beautiful schloss",
          "This place has lawns and ponds. there is a park like a forest.In january you have no leaves and no colors as expected. good to visit in some other season. at the end of park you will find tiny beach on Rhine river.",

          "Good Place with huge lawans and gardens and the entrance to the palace through the small forest like lawn was good. Entrance into the Palace/Home was 9 Euro. Entrance into the lawns,garden area is free.",
          "The palace features a great park with different theme spots and a few small ponds, even something that quite resembles a forest in the middle of the city. It is really pleasant to take a walk through. Sometimes there are events organized in the park like concerts, etc. The",
          "The buildings itself were very unimpressive.. but the huge lawns and then wooded area behind were good.. i would give it a miss cause for one it is quite a way out and then two nothing much to do.. for a outing e.g a picnic with kids would be fun but not for tourists..",
          "There are multiple buildings, large gardens and a pond. This was once what could be called a large manor house and it's associated buildings. There's a pair of museums that are housed on either side of the castle itself, and we toured the natural history museum with it's",
          "Really enjoyed the scenery and the beautiful gardens. We could've walked a lot more but it started to rain. The coffee shop was pretty but no one would serve us so we tried the Natural Museum. A complete waste of 6 euro. Nothing in English, the displays were amateurish and there",

          "My review solely concerns the grounds, we didn't take the guided tour. It is free to visit the grounds/gardens, and for this reason if you're on a budget while in Dusseldorf, you should definitely consider a visit here. There is a fee if you want to take the tour of the house.",
          "We came here on our last day in Germany. We were flying back to the UK from Dusseldorf and we spent the last day in Dusseldorf with our friends who live in Cologne. This is a very pretty place and it is well worth a visit if you have some time. It was very peaceful and the",
          "We traveled out to the Schloss on our last day in Dusseldorf on Easter Monday and so glad we did. We managed to get a tour of the Schloss with an extremely knowledgeable young female guide who conducted it half in German and half English . The tour started in the basement and",
          "We spent an hour or so wandering round the mix of formal gardens and woodland. We went on a Monday so it was pretty quiet but my friend said it gets really busy at the weekends. It was a beautiful day when we went and I think it would be a really lovely place to take a picnic",
          "The peculiarity is the nice pinkreddish color and the surroundings. In fron there is a small lake which during the winter is froxen and behind the castle you have a beautyfull park nice for walks and jogging",

          "We visited Benrath during the morning. We went there by metro. Takes a while though. But the metro stop is right before the entrence. You can also take the train to Benrath station. You need to walk to the castle for about 5-10 minutes. Unfortunately the 2 museums and the",
          "Good views. A great place to walk in the open air. Nice gardens :) It's not easy to park. We had to leave the car quite far away.",
          "A nice place to visit even if I could not get in because it was just about to close down, the park and neighborhood are pretty. I guess it is a good destination in the south of town",
          "You'll get so much more out of the experience. Don't forger to walk around the surrounding huge park. It's gardens are amazing especially during spring.",
          "Schloss itself was average, but the grounds were beautiful...the autumn colours of the exstensive woods were a pleasure to walk in.",
          "Easy enough to get to by bus, but not close to anything else. We wandered around outside and took pictures, but didn't do the tour. It was an enjoyable morning.",
          "The Palace looked unassuming from afar but once we entered onto the grounds, we were quite taken by the garden and the lake and the large shady walking paths. It was a good area for a stroll and for relaxation. Plenty of garden seats around too!",
          "Well worth a visit if you have time during your trip. It's not necessary to go inside to enjoy the trip either. The grounds are nice enough.",
          "Take a trip on the U74 or the 701 tram which both stop outside. You can stroll through the grounds without paying and the tea room, not expensive, is like taking tea in a stately home. The gift shop is above average.",

          "Having just visited Schloss Benrath I would like to correct some of the misapprehensions of previous reviewers. I speak no German at all, and had no trouble with the normal German tour, the guide spoke good English and was very willing to clarify any issues. We didn\u00b4t have to",
          "It has been some time now since my partner and I visited Benrath while on a Christmas break to Dusseldorf in December 2010. The city itself was fantastic but we decided to take a day trip to visit Benrath Castle. It was fairly quiet being the beginning of December, so tourists",
          "We didn't go into the Schloss as we had limited time, but enjoyed a tranquil walk around the (free) park and gardens.The Spiegelweiher ( reflecting pond) is nearly 500 metres long and is a very beautiful sight. There are several small themed gardens to visit, as well as an",
          "I have been to Schloss Benrath multiple times, and I have always enjoyed each time. It is a wonderful, quaint castle, located just outside Duesseldorf and very accessible by train or bus. This most recent time, I took my girls to the natural history exhibit, displaying all",
          "Went down to Benrath from where we are staying in Hilden; it is a mganificent lake with a small fountain and lots of ducks and swans swimming around but we were very disappointed that you had to prebook to go into the palace and even then, it was weeks in advance! We have not",
          "One of my favourite parts of Dusseldrf to visit. The gardens are outstanding. Get the tram to schloss benrath, rather than benrath, it's right there.",
          "Schloss Benrath has history, culture and beautiful gardens. A nice place for a walk, with benches along the ponds to sit, watch the swans and ducks (or feed them). Great place for families.",
          "My wife and I toured the Schloss this past week and really enjoyed it. We we very fortunate that we had our own personal tour guide, who was very friendly, and knowledgeable. We learned a lot about the palace and /german culture in general. One word of caution - in order to",
          "You have to make an appointment 3 months in advance to get the good tour of the Schloss ( the King who commissioned it only visited one time for 5 hours) which is a museum, but the grounds with a long reflecting pool are well worth a visit.",

          "Schloss Benrath is very nice to visit at a sunny day as not only the building itself is very nice but also the park surrounding it. If you visit, you should definitely do the trip inside as it is very interesting to see the intelligent architecture for the staff serving the",

          "green and well-maintained garden, for a walk or for a picnic on sunday sunny day",
          "Having lived next to this fantastic park for a few years I can really recommend a day trip almost any time of year to enjoy the nice looks, green lawns, playgrounds, jogging paths and more. Of course, in spring time when the magnolia trees are in bloom it offers an orgy in pink",
          "We went during peak winter and again during start of summer. However, this place is good for bicycle riders who can go around the palace and then continue along the river to go back to the city. The palace has a huge pond in the middle and is surrounded by what must have once",
          "One of the few sightseeings I did when in Duesseldorf, certainly worth its effort. Huge gardens with flowers that blossom, realy old building with amazing details on the roof. Make sure you will spend 2-3 hours there on a sunny day to make it worth.",

          "If you are in the area this is an interesting couple of hours. I was lucky enough to get an English tour - not usually given but our small group were all English-speakers (even the Germans). IF you go skip the museums - all in German, and not very good regardless."

The construction began in 1854 after it was planned completely in a tesselated paradigm. It was named in honour to King Frederick William IV of Prussia. In the beginning it was a bit swampy, but after a short while it developed well and became a borough mainly for officers and public clerks. Even today in Friedrichstadt many buildings are in the Wilhelminian style.\nThe idea of the Garden City was another concept proved in Friedrichstadt. The garden architect Maximilian Weyhe designed two parks with ponds in Friedrichstadt. In 1880 the Parliament of the Prussian Rhine Province got its seat in the St\u00e4ndehaus (House of States) in Friedrichstadt.

        "wiki": "The Church of St. Andreas (German: St. Andreas) is a Roman Catholic parish church situated in the center of the German city of D\u00fcsseldorf. It is the priory church of the local community of Dominican Friars, who also administer the much older Church of St. Lambert.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe church, dedicated to St. Andrew, was constructed between 1622 and 1629 in the South German baroque style. It was originally built for the Jesuits, who arrived in D\u00fcsseldorf in 1619, and served as the \"court church\" for the Counts palatine of Neuburg (House of Palatinate-Neuburg) from 1708. After the dissolution of the Jesuit order in August 1773, it served as a parish church until 2005, when it became the monastery church of the Dominican Order. The building itself is now owned by the land of North Rhine Westphalia.The church is furnished with stucco by Johannes Kuhn from Strassburg and life-size sculptures of the apostles and of saints of the Society of Jesus.\n\nIn the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the church was an important center of musical culture in D\u00fcsseldorf. The composer Johann Hugo von Wilderer served as its organist. The mausoleum, designed by Venetian architect Simone del Sarto, contains the tombs of several Electors Palatine, including that of Johann Wilhelm. The high altar of the church was destroyed during World War II. The new altar, designed by Ewald Matar\u00e9 was built in 1960. Paintings by Ernst Deger can be found in the church's two side altars which are dedicated to the Virgin Mary.In 1972 the church came under the pastoral care of the local community of Dominican Friars and became their priory church.\n\n\n== Organ ==\nThe organ dates back to an instrument built in 1782 by Peter Kemper, in a casing by Bernhard Orlinski and Josef Zimmermann. In World War II the organ was damaged. In 1953 it was restored and expanded by 18 stops by the organ builder Fabritius. In 1970/71 and again in 2003, the organ was restored by Rudolf von Beckerath Orgelbau.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to St. Andreas D\u00fcsseldorf at Wikimedia Commons\nSt. Andreas, entry in the database of the D\u00fcsseldorf Institut f\u00fcr Denkmalschutz und Denkmalpflege (Institute for Monument Protection and Preservation) (in German)",

          "I'm hardly a fashionista, but both my wife and sister-in-law have *opinions* about fashion, so when I found myself in Dusseldorf after a work trip recently, I figured I'd have a look around, and take some pictures that I could send them. As it turns out, I had a blast exploring",
          "We only visited the permanent collection, skipping the three special exhibits on offer for lack of time. There\u2019s a nice selection of paintings from various historical periods, of course with emphasis on German artists. There\u2019s a fair amount of sculpture too. Most of the works",
          "Really worth a visit! A great place with a very large collection to see. It is super clean and has s wardrobe for storing clothes/bags. I was allowed to take photos with my professional camera the whole way around just as long as it didn\u2019t have the flash on. There is no options",
          "Alltogether interesting and good quality collection of modern and classical art, divided over various parts of the building. One could choose whether or not one wanted to see the temporary exhibition or not. We chose not, unfortunately the deliniation of where the permanent",
          "Maybe my timing was bad- Looks like I visited between special exhibitions, and maybe during renovations? The museum itself describes the permanent collection as 'scant', and it was, even though there were some interesting paintings in the 20th century department. The older,",
          "We thought to \"just\" do this museum and were utterly amazed by the vast collection from medieval paintings to contempory art. We loved the Young Rhinecountry exhibition (Das Junge Rheinland) and Front Line Female Photographers (Fotografinnen an der Front von Lee Miller bis Anja",
          "I spend almost a whole day exploring this amazing art collection. I enjoyed the glass museum - it was fascinating! A must for every art-fan!",
          "The Museum's collection consists of an art gallery - paintings by old masters, including Rubens and L. Cranach the Elder; paintings of the XIX century - the work of A. Beklin, M. Lieberman, A. Menzel, K.D/ Friedrich, and art of the XX century - A. Mack, F. Mark, K. Rolfs, L.",
          "This is a very nice museum but one of the major reasons to come here is to see the glass. A very large and very tasteful display of glass focusing on glass through the ages. Several floors will keep you quite busy. There is an incredible display in a separate room that happens",
          "Spent 5 hours wandering around this wonderful gallery. All the exhibts were displayed beautifully and the women War photographers exhibition was just brilliant. If you get a chance to visit make sure you do as it well worth the entry ticket cost.",
          "We went there especially for the glass collection. It didn't disappoint. Very very nice! The normal museum collection was also nice. not to much and not to many visitors at once",
          "At a first glance you might think it's a typical art museum, the kind you can visit in any major European city. It hosts some impressive Rubens paintings and works from many other less known artists. However, the main atraction is the glassworks exhibition, I found it very",
          "The Museum Kunstpalast really gives you a good view of D\u00fcsseldorf as the German \"Art-City\" - \"Kunststadt\" - and has a lot of paintings from the \"D\u00fcsseldorder Malerschule\" (19th C) But also elder art - and modern art. And the history starts outside - why are two figures missing ?",
          "The Museum is located near the river Rhine. Parking is possible in their underground parking lot and on the street. We visited the exposition \u201cPS, ich liebe Dich\u201d, which was a sports car exposition but not centred on the car but in the design of it. We had a guided tour of it",

          "We visited glass museum on premises and it was an amazing experience. It was a large exhibition with some really beautiful and interesting pieces. There's also a lot of information about the craft.",
          "If you're visiting the Altstadt the Kunstpalast is a little off the beaten track but worth the 20 minute walk to get there if you need some quiet time. Admission prices are a little high but for five euros you can view the resident exhibits and kill a couple of hours without too",
          "Located close to the Rhein River and old town. The somewhat less inviting exterior of the large building and garden did not give any indication of the fantastic display of art that we would find in the interior. It could easily have been missed from our touring itinerary. Great",
          "The museum has a lot of different art pieces and was not busy at all when we visited in June. The glass collection sounded really interesting but was nothing amazing. There are not a lot of things to do in this city unless you are interested in shopping. This is one of the",
          "Defenetly worth visiting. Glass museum (bottom level) not big, but has real masterpieces. You can select Video guides movie, that allow you to see 10-12 the most famous glass factory (each movie is about 10 min) (free). Upper levels are dedicated to modern artists (1950-2015)",
          "For accessible exhibits of Rembrandt, Degas among other great artists and art, one will not be disappointed. Especially enjoyed glass art collection. Stunning ancient and modern glass art. Spend the day and visit cafe.",
          "Not being a fan of art museums, this one is the best yet that i visited. Staff is friendly and helpful. There are audioguides (never seen those in art museums before) that explain you some background about the pictures you see. Price is reasonable. Size is manageable. And you",
          "The museum is quite nice with good objects. But, its kind of confusing how the tour is, the object information plats is not in english and in every room there is a guard following your every step all the time at close distant.",
          "Nice, large collection mainly of old art, but the most important part is their glass art collection. Worth a short visit.",
          "The glass works exhibit on the first floor is exceptional both in its range from the ancient to modern works. Nicely set up and extensive. This is not to diminish the sculpture and paintings which are also well presented and wide ranging. Good collection of modern pieces.",
          "Do you know what Netsukes are? Visit this museum and find out. You can find a wide variety of art objects here which will tease your senses. Building seems architecture of 30's, giving you the flavor of the period of that time. Recommend visit, it takes about 2 hours going",
          "Renovated soviet style building with excellent collection of old masters, and contemporary Duesseldorf artists. One major gallery closd for repairs in 2017, check website. Highlights: Renaissance wood sculpture, Rubens room.",
          "This is a large museum with a fine collection for every taste. When I visited there was a small exhibition about Entartete Kunst during the Nazi era. Another section had spectacular religious woodwork from around 15th century and more. But the best collection was in the",
          "A great experience here at the Kunstpalast. Currently there is the Lucas Cranach the Elder exhibition which is a real to-do. I came to see the works of Caspar David Friedrich; but was pleasantly surprised by the high level of the Cranach exhibit stretching all the way to the",
          "Museum Kunstpalast hosts really nice exhibitions. Even after half a dozen visits we can confirm there is a wide variety in themes of the collections, each time very successful accompanying audioguides are offered (included in entrance fee). Besides the specific exhibitions",
          "I didn't go inside the museum, but I really liked to go there because I enjoyed the square in front of the museum.",
          "I loved the Lucas Cranach exhibition, really well presented with a fascinating audioguide, and the section at the end on Cranach's influence on modern painters was brilliant. Great that photos weren't allowed - it irritates me when people snap away rather than look at the art.",
          "Lucas Cranach exhibition did not deserve such a presentation . Having such an unique artist with his work almost 500 years ago to show, needed more passion and engagement . Just look what Museum are doing in other countries like Ottawa in Canada, Amsterdam or Brussels or",
          "The layout is rather strange, the collections are spread between buildings and as a result I ended up missing half of the collections. The ticket sales person asked me if I wanted a ticket for the whole museum or just one building and I chose just one thinking everything would",
          "We saw the exhibition 'behind the curtain', which had a great range of artists. The other galleries had fantastic paintings, which we assume were permanently on display. I did not expect to be blown away by so much of the work in the glass museum, but I was. This is most",
          "We loved it. The glass collection was the best, from earliest utilitarian pieces to modern art exhibits. Almost a small museum in it's own right. Check out the current visiting exhibition as well, and if you like the sound of that, it's worth a visit.",
          "After the K20 museum, I thought this was the other interesting art museum in Dusseldorf. The layout as some have mention is a bit odd, but nothing to dampen the experience. For me the highlights included the Modern Art, with works by Kirchner, Marc, Dix, Macke, Hockney and",
          "But depends mostly on the exhibitions taking place there! However it\u00b4s definitely a place to visit from time to time",
          "Spent a rainy morning here to visit the art collection. Interesting exhibition and some very historical pieces of art. Layout between the two buildings is odd and somewhat difficult to navigate but still worth the visit. Do not arrive early as there is no place to have coffee",
          "Fifteen minutes after entering the museum my son and I were verbally abused by the guard/museum attendant on the first floor and left. I was carrying a small oblong shaped backpack with very expensive Canon camera equipment in it. I made sure to speak with the guard on ground",
          "***Please note that the museum is closed on Mondays \ud83d\ude2c This is one of my favorite museums in the world. It is not too crowded so you can enjoy the place without any distractions. Jean Tinguely exhibit was so great.. Also the glass art exhibit was wonderful\ud83d\ude0a I have gone there",
          "The main displays on view were by Jean Tinguely his Super MetaMaxi a collection of very over the top mechanical absurdities ,my wife has seen better scrap yards(quote). The museum is a nice place and a lovely walk through a nice park from the old town entrance fees also get you",
          "A very soothing place filled with a large variety of work. Went there for the glass work but ended-up enjoying and satying much longer. efinitely well worth the time.",
          "I went there coincidently but love it. The personnel is so helpful; works are out of imagination. I also love its garden but because of the winter time I cannot spend time there",
          "Famous art museum, classical, modern. Well arranged. Many special exhibitions. Worth a trip for sure.",
          "We are visit\u00edng today the excebition of the famous spanish painter ZUBARAN. Really amazing, it's only possible to see this extraordinary collection of famous paintings until 31st January 2016- but there are always fine art works to see in future !",
          "If you like art and know about it this is the place for you. the've got some prints and then they have a big (huge) area with renaissance art where you can see some amazing things. There's another part with some art by Joseph Boyce, I think he studied in Dusseldolf. And there is",
          "This is a spacious museum, not too many people. Great temporary expositions; we also got access to the permanent collection (some nice Dutch and Flemish painters).",
          "I visited this museum to see the traveling Zurbaran exhibit and was delighted to find a superb collection of historic and art glass.",
          "You must go see this exhibit even if you know nothing about art or Zubaran! Be sure to spend 3 euros and rent the headset. With the headset, the tour takes just over an hour. My husband knew nothing about Zubaran and thoroughly enjoyed the visit. Zubaran painted in such",
          "Heavy emphasis and honest exhibits of the years following the war. Principally geared for the German people with little effort to offer translations either on display or audio guide. Exposure to German politics, a nod to a divided country, and cultural reminiscence. Still worth",
          "I visited this fine art Museum and I especially enjoyed their fine temporary exhibit featuring splendid paintings by Francisco de Zurbaran.I appreciated the light effects of those paintings.Personal Zurbaran favorites were:\"Saint Casilda \",Fra Pedro de Ona.and\"Saint Francis",
          "When I was there, they had an awesome exhibit with works from a major Baroque artist, which made the visit exceptional. Of course, they won't always have that same special exhibit, but I'm sure that they have something regularly. But I still feel confident giving this five stars",
          "This has such an etherial exhibit in an atrium style with a modern white tree with lights on it in the middle of the museum. I loved this place.",
          "but that's about all. It is an impressive exhibit and discusses the history of glass as decorative art from ancient times to the present- the rest of the museum is weak.",
          "I had a really tough time finding this hotel. I took the train and then walked. There were not many people on foot - on the street or near the museum. I entered the doorway across from the entrance even though both were labeled Kunstpalast... I was shocked that there were not",
          "I don't know whether I went to this or not. K20 and K21 i did and got a free taxi shuttle between the two museums.If this was the one by Tonhalle then I missed it as it was closed as most museums on MONDAYS. Better co-ordination and info for Tourists?!! Numbers in Dusseldorf",
          "Large museum a little way north of the Altstadt - just follow the Rhine to get there. It has separate areas with modern art, older art - including a whole room of paintings by Rubens - and a particularly fine glass section. It also holds special exhibitions on a regular basis.",
          "The Kunspalast has got 3 collections: glass works, old masters -mainlay German - and modern paintings. Our problem was that there are too many not so important art works, and just some great paintings. This is not the first museum you should visit in D\u00fcsseldorf.",
          "I went to this museum one Sunday when everything was closed. I had planned to spend my last day in Germany shopping. Oops. This museum was open and I decided to go. What a pleasant surprise. Great collections of modern and classical art. If you can go by August of 2015,",
          "Depending from THE time you are going you can visit this museum as a few others in That Same area. Those museums have very Nice exibitions. You can check THE website of dusseldorf art and culture and i am pretty sure you can always Find an exhibition you like",
          "Okay, I understand the other reviewers bitterness. The building may look good from outside, but they are not connected, thus you have to make many U-turns and get out of the building and enter again to see the other exhibition. (And even in a same building, the flow is very",
          "Stopped in to see the glass museum and was not disappointed. Nice history of glass from middle ages to modern sculptures. The rest of the museum was also worth seeing and was more than I expected from a small city like Dusseldorf.",
          "The museum was like a 3D maze with many dead-ends. There were more staffs than visitors and they told me don't go that way and go this way every time I stepped into some wrong place (The signposts are sparse and written only in German that I couldn't read.) One of them even",
          "Somehow we managed to see the glass exhibits for free and some of the modern pieces were interesting. However we did not feel like paying to see the other exhibits but the shhop was nice and had a good range of gifts.",
          "It's Split into 2 buildings and you pay at either entrance for both. One side has a pleasant cafe and houses temporary exhibitions usually and the other building usually has the permanent collection including a large glass collection",
          "i really enjoyed my visit here my kids didnt tho, must have more translation as language was a issue",
          "If you are in D\u00fcsseldorf and you want to see a Museum showing classic paintings, you must go to the Kunstpalast. Although the statement may look preposterous, it is not easy to discover this fact. I love classic German painting and, when I arrived in D\u00fcsseldorf, I immediately",
          "There is a convenient shuttle between the two museums. and you can buy a combined ticket as well. Nice cafe serving Flammekuchen.",
          "I visited when there was a change in exhibitions - basically one wing closed. I watched the \"Alten Meister\" - bit too much for me. Maybe because I saw the George Grosz exhibit first - many drawings - nice overview. Then a smaller wing with modern art ... some weird pieces. A lot",
          "We arrived amid a jazz concert in front of the museum complex and enjoyed the music inside as well. The glass exhibit is quite magnificent. The museum has some Rubens as well as interesting 19th and 20th century art.",
          "current show \"Art & Alchemy\" not to be missed. Main collection covers all centuries, so something for everyone. Huge glass collection interesting. Allow an hour at least to pick & choose from entire collection.",
          "After visiting this place, I re-read some comments posted by other recent reviewers, and had to nod my head in agreement : \"very officious attendants\"; \"depressing exterior hides a truly fantastic museum.\" So true. Then again, it seems to me that these descriptions apply",
          "Very disjointed with very officious attendants. I was asked to show my ticket 5 times and told that I could not carry my coat - hence visitors tying their coats around their waists. The girl at the ticket desk said the Cream Cheese was open but it was not. The glass is",
          "Depressing exterior hides a truly fantastic museum. Even with part of it closed for a new installation it was worth several hours. The Glass section alone was worth the modest admission. That area was amazing! If you are a fan of glass you must see it. Rest of the museum was",
          "I was in the area with time so I headed into this museum. There are some nice parts, particularly the glass museum. We rarely get a lot of glass in other museums. But overall I was not impressed. There are some nice works here but no extensive sampling of any period. I also",
          "Have been there there for different occaions/ exhibtions. Always great. Its worth going there especially if they have a dedicated exhibition. It was enjoyable everytime we went there! Check it out and if you you are interested in the exhibition go in!",
          "Highly recommended. not many people there and we were able to look at any display we wanted for as long as we wanted.",
          "We had already had a long walk through town and had no idea that the museum/art gallery was so vast, so we started in the cafe on the top floor, overlooking the fantasy tree in the huge atrium, and then worked our way down and around via many interesting galleries. The fee was",
          "We enjoyed the very large Dusseldorf museum (allow a full day here) --although we had a hell of a time trying to get information about the current and ongoing exhibits during a period where they had a roof leak and thus had removed much of the art we were traveling there to see.",
          "The Kunspalast has a worthwhile collection ranging from Middle Age masterpieces to 20th century paintings. German romantic paintings are a key part of the collection. The associates Glass Museum is not to be missed.",
          "Set out very well on 3 floors Glass museum then art and sculpture. Nice and airy{museums and Art galleries are usually so humid} relaxed and easy going no rush...but best to go just after they open @11:00 Tue---Sun",
          "if u interest on art, then should stop your foot here. in the morning , we went to Hetjens museum,then we have 2 more hours before 1700 , so we went to this museum. That is huge , but got 3 floors. sometimes there are some special exhibitions held which need extra cost. But, if",
          "We went on a rainy day in April and were the only two people in the entire museum. The glass collection was very nice, the other sections were just average. I have to comment on the obnoxious amount of security in each room. We were stopped three times and asked to see our",
          "I only went to see Gursky, but it rocked! The place is massive and can get crowded, but I'm glad I went. They really do present the pieces very well. I didn't check out the rest of the museum, but I really liked this part/exhibition.",
          "Very interesting museum with a variety of exhibitions - from wooden icons and statues of 11-12 century, amazing paintings of 19 century to the modern arts. They also have gorgeous exhibitin of glass, again from ancient ages till nowadays. Kunstpalast in Dusseldorf is worth",
          "While some of the 19th-century galleries, which I remembered to have major holdings of Dusseldorf-school landscape paintings, were closed, we were very impressed by this museum's extensive and significant collection of historical and contemporary glass, including both displays",
          "If you are in Dusseldorf between May 2012 and September 2012, you must go. A fabulous show!",
          "I bought way to much in the little shop. Organisation is very good, although if you would like to drink something, be very patient. Very very patient. Toilets are free, and very clean.",
          "Viisted the \"El Greco and the moderns\" exhibition. Most impressive. The Kunstpalast seems to be well-equipped for large exhibitions. We didn't visit the collection. The facilities are very good. Seems to be a highly professional venue.",
          "Apart from 2 Rembrandt paintings, Museum Kunst Palast does not have many work to show. It looks more like a gallery than a museum. Besides, half of it was closed for an event when we visited it, so we did not have the chance to see the whole of it.",
          "The museum was very interesting with many different styles and ages of paintings. The glass exhibition was very good and excellently displayed. Well worth an hour or two during your visit to Dusseldorf",
          "Visited it during the \"nights-of-the-museums\". This museum is north of Tonhalle and the NRW-forum. Of course, the night ambience and the massive attendance added to the overall impression, but is worth visiting any day time."

        "wiki": "Magnum, P.I. is an American crime drama television series starring Tom Selleck as Thomas Magnum, a private investigator (P.I.) living on Oahu, Hawaii. The series ran from 1980 to 1988 during its first-run broadcast on the American television network CBS. According to the Nielsen ratings, Magnum, P.I. consistently ranked in the top twenty U.S. television programs during the first five years of its original run in the United States.A reboot series of the same name was ordered to series on May 11, 2018, and premiered on September 24, 2018 on CBS.\n\n\n== Premise ==\nThomas Sullivan Magnum III is a private investigator played by Tom Selleck. He resides in the guest house of a 200-acre (81 ha) beachfront estate called Robin's Nest, in Hawaii, at the invitation of its owner, Robin Masters, the celebrated, but never-seen, author of several dozen lurid novels. Ostensibly this is quid pro quo for Magnum's services based upon his expertise in security; the pilot and several early episodes suggest Magnum had done Masters a favor of some kind, possibly when Masters hired him for a case. The voice of Robin Masters, heard only in five episodes, was provided by Orson Welles (one last \"appearance\" was provided by a different actor, Red Crandell).Magnum lives a luxurious life on the estate and operates as a P.I. on cases that suit him. The only thorn in the side of his near-perfect lifestyle is Jonathan Quayle Higgins III, played by John Hillerman. An ex-British Army Sergeant Major, he is on the surface a stern, \"by-the-book\" caretaker of Robin's Nest, whose strict ways often conflict with Magnum's more easy-going methods. He patrols Robin's Nest with his two highly trained \"lads\", Doberman Pinschers named Zeus and Apollo. Magnum has free use of the guest house and the car, a Ferrari 308 GTS Quattrovalvole, but as a humorous aside in various episodes, often has to bargain with Higgins for use of estate amenities such as the tennis courts, wine cellar and expensive cameras.\nThe relationship between Magnum and Higgins is initially cool, but as the series progressed, an unspoken respect and fondness of sorts grew between the pair. Many episodes dedicated more screen time to this \"odd couple\" pairing after the relationship proved popular with fans. A recurrent theme throughout the last two seasons, starting in the episode \"Paper War\", involves Magnum's sneaking suspicion that Higgins is actually Robin Masters since he opens Robin's mail, calls Robin's Ferrari \"his car\" etc. This suspicion is neither proved nor disproved, although in at least one episode Higgins is shown alone in a room, picking up a ringing phone and talking to Robin Masters, indicating they are two different persons.Aside from Higgins, Magnum's two main companions on the islands are Theodore Calvin \"T.C.\" (Roger E. Mosley), who runs a local helicopter charter service called \"Island Hoppers\", and often finds himself persuaded by Magnum to fly him during various cases, and Orville Wilbur Richard \"Rick\" Wright (Larry Manetti), who refuses to use his given name Orville and who owns a local bar. In the pilot episode, this was \"Rick's Cafe Americain\" in town, inspired by Casablanca, with Rick appearing in suitable 1930s attire. After completing the pilot, though, executives felt that audiences would be unable to fully connect with this element. Instead, Rick moved to running the plush, beachside King Kamehameha Club, which has exclusive membership and Higgins on the board of directors. Magnum often strolls around the club, using its facilities and running up an ever-unpaid tab, further fueling the Magnum-Higgins feud.\nT.C. and Rick are both former Marines from Marine Observation Squadron 2 (VMO-2) with whom Magnum, a former Navy SEAL and Naval Intelligence officer, served in the Vietnam War. The series was one of the first to deal with Vietnam veterans as \"human beings\" and not as shell-shocked killers, and was praised by many ex-servicemen groups for doing so. Magnum often dupes or bribes T.C. and Rick into aiding him on his cases, much to their frustration, though the deep friendship within the group, including Higgins, proved to be one of the key elements of the program over its eight-season run.Magnum comes and goes as he pleases, works only when he wants, and has the almost unlimited use of the Ferrari and many other luxuries of the estate. He keeps a mini-refrigerator with a seemingly endless supply of beer (\"Old D\u00fcsseldorf in a long neck\"), wears his father's treasured Rolex GMT Master wristwatch and is surrounded by countless beautiful women, who are often victims of crime, his clients, or are connected in various other ways to the cases he solves.\nOther characteristics specific to Magnum are his thick moustache, baseball caps (usually a Detroit Tigers or VMO-2 cap), a rubber chicken, and a variety of colorful Aloha shirts. Nearly every episode is narrated, in voice-over, by Magnum at various points. At the end of the seventh season, Magnum was to be killed off, to end the series. Following an outcry from fans who demanded a more satisfactory conclusion, an eighth season was produced to bring Magnum \"back to life\" and to round off the series.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n=== Main cast ===\n\nTom Selleck as Thomas Sullivan Magnum III\nRoger E. Mosley as Theodore \"T.C.\" Calvin\nLarry Manetti as Rick Wright\nJohn Hillerman as Jonathan Quayle Higgins III\n\n\n=== Recurring characters ===\nLt. Yoshi Tanaka: A homicide-division police lieutenant with the Honolulu police department (played by Kwan Hi Lim), he has a slight Lieutenant Columbo-like enigmatic quality, characterized by his casual dress and ironic sense of humor. He is also, like Magnum, a Detroit Tigers fan. He appeared in Seasons 2\u20138.\nAgatha Chumley: Higgins' quintessentially English lady friend (played by Gillian Dobb), who seems to have a crush on Higgins. Her first appearance was in the episode \"Black on White.\" She appeared in Seasons 3\u20138.\nColonel \"Buck\" Greene: A Marine Corps aviator and intelligence officer (played by Lance LeGault), who is often Magnum's nemesis in seasons 2\u20138. LeGault also played John W. Newton, aka \"Delta One\" in Episode 1.9 \"Missing in Action\".\nCarol Baldwin: An assistant district attorney (played in all but the first appearance by Kathleen Lloyd). She appeared in Seasons 3\u20138 in this role; before playing Carol Baldwin, Lloyd guest starred in the episode \"Almost Home\" as Bridget Archer.\nLieutenant \"Mac\" MacReynolds: A doughnut-munching Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) lieutenant (played by Jeff MacKay), killed by a car bomb planted by \"Ivan\", a Russian KGB officer. Mac returns as a ghost for three episodes (\"Mac's Back\", \"Limbo\" and \"Infinity and Jelly Doughnuts\") and later as a look-alike character (see below). In the pilot, MacKay portrayed \"Ski\", a guard at the entrance gate of Pearl Harbor. He appeared in Seasons 1\u20133 and 7\u20138.\nJim Bonnick: A con man and an ex-Navy pilot who was released on a medical discharge, (played by Jeff MacKay), he was also Mac Reynolds' look-alike. In at least one episode (\"Mac's Back\"), MacKay appeared in both roles. He appeared in Seasons 5\u20138.\nFrancis \"Icepick\" Hofstetler: An American loan shark and major underworld figure from Chicago, and a quasi-father figure to Rick Wright (played initially by Walter Chotzen and then by veteran actor Elisha Cook Jr.).\nDr. Ibold, M.D. \"Doc Ibold\": A minor character (played by Glenn Cannon) who appeared in episodes when the script called for a physician. First referred to as \"Script Writer #1\", he was known for prescribing opiates for any and all ailments. He appeared in Seasons 2\u20138. Cannon also played Dr. Bernard Kessler in Episode 1.7, \"Never Again...Never Again\".\nMichelle Hue: The love of Magnum's life (played by Marta DuBois); she and Magnum married in Vietnam but the devoutly Catholic Michelle had the marriage annulled after her first husband, a North Vietnamese general who was presumed dead, resurfaced. Magnum had believed that Michelle was killed during the 1975 evacuation of Saigon. She appeared in Seasons 2\u20138.\nLieutenant (later Lieutenant Commander) Maggie Poole: The successor of the deceased Mac Reynolds (played by Jean Bruce Scott), she dislikes her superior, Marine Corps Colonel Greene. She appeared in Seasons 3\u20138.\nLuther H. Gillis: A mock film-noir St. Louis private eye with a Boston accent (played by Eugene Roche), whose deception, dissembling and disturbing capacity for violence are almost always underestimated or overlooked by Magnum. Gillis provided the narration in the five episodes in which he appeared in Seasons 4\u20138.\nLt. Nolan Page: A hard-nosed, no-nonsense Honolulu Police Department lieutenant with a New York accent (played by Joe Santos) assists Magnum on several cases.\nMoki: The bartender of the King Kamehameha Club in Season 1; later replaced by Keoki, he appeared in Seasons 1\u20132.\nKeoki: The bartender/server of the King Kamehameha Club starting in Season 2. He is arrested in season 4 by Lt. Tanaka for robbing the club in the episode \"I Witness\". He appeared in Seasons 2\u20134.\nBryant Calvin, T.C.'s son in seasons 7 and 8, played by Shavar Ross.\n\n\n=== Guest stars ===\nThe following notable actors (including some future stars) appeared on the show: \n\n\n== Setting ==\n\nRobin's Nest (21.324917\u00b0N 157.679526\u00b0W\ufeff / 21.324917; -157.679526) is the fictional beach front estate on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, which serves as the residence of the main characters. In the series, it is owned by renowned novelist Robin Masters, who employs Jonathan Higgins as the estate's caretaker and Thomas Magnum as its security expert. Higgins resides in the estate's main house while Magnum occupies the guest house.\nIn reality, the 3-acre (1.2 ha) beachfront property was located on the east shore of Oahu at 41-505 Kalanianaole Highway (Route 72) near Waimanalo Beach (21\u00b019\u203230\u2033N 157\u00b040\u203248\u2033W). Called \"Pahonu\" (\"turtle enclosure\" in Hawaiian), it was also known locally as \"The Anderson Estate\" after long-time owner, local politician Eve Anderson. The grounds had been used for hundreds of years for raising green sea turtles for the Hawaiian royal family and includes a 500-by-50-foot stone wall that surrounds the former turtle-raising pond. Since 1978, the turtle pond has been on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Hawaii. A residential estate since the early 1930s, comprising an 11,000-square-foot (1,000 m2) main house, a boathouse (which in the series appears as the guest house that Magnum occupies), a gatehouse, and private tennis court.Owned in January 2014 by Cox Communications heiress Barbara Cox Anthony, it was placed on the market with Sotheby's International Realty for $15.75 million and sold for $8.7 million in March 2015. In April 2018, the estate was demolished.Many of the indoor scenes of Magnum, P.I. were filmed on the old Hawaii Five-O soundstage, as the network did not wish for their Hawaiian production facilities to go to waste after Hawaii Five-O ended its run.Through the years, fans of the show have noted commonalities in the settings of time and space (the so-called fictional TV universe) between Magnum, P.I. and Hawaii Five-O. For example, in Season 1, Episode 5: \"Thank Heavens for Little Girls, and Big Ones Too\", Higgins calls Five-O to report a theft. Or Season 1 Episode 6: \"Skin Deep\", Magnum (Tom Selleck) gets on the radio pretending he's with the police and asks: \"Billy, this is McGarrett of Five-O. Is David Norman armed?\" The producers of Magnum, P.I. unsuccessfully attempted to convince Jack Lord to make a cameo.However, in a 2013 episode of the Hawaii Five-0 reboot, the characters \"sing\" the Magnum, P.I. theme song while discussing which person most resembled the characters on that television program. The purported connection between the two programs appears to be preserved in the reboots, as explained by their creators in TV Guide, where plans for a crossover were announced as well as acknowledgement of the coexistence of Magnum with Hawaii Five-0 in the same TV universe. A two-part crossover event between Hawaii Five-0 and Magnum P.I. aired on CBS in January 2020, with the Hawaii Five-0 episode \"Ihea 'oe i ka wa a ka ua e loku ana?\" (which is Hawaiian for \"Where were you when the rain was pouring?\"), followed by the Magnum P.I. episode \"Desperate Measures\".\n\n\n== Theme music ==\nThe original theme music for the opening credits of the pilot episode was a mid-tempo jazzy piece by Ian Freebairn-Smith. This music was also used for the next nine regular episodes.Beginning in Episode 12, it was replaced by a more uptempo theme typical of 1980s action series by Mike Post and Pete Carpenter with guitar by Larry Carlton. This theme had been used during the show and over the closing credits from Episode 8. A longer version of this second theme (\"Theme from Magnum P.I.\", 3:25 in duration) credited to Post was released as a 7-inch single by Elektra Records in 1982 and featured on the Billboard Hot 100 chart that same year, peaking at No. 25 on 8 May 1982. This version also appeared on Post's 1982 album Television Theme Songs.\n\n\n== Vehicles ==\n\n\n=== Cars ===\nRobin Masters' cars\n\n\"ROBIN 1\"\n1979 Ferrari 308GTS (season 1)\n1981 Ferrari 308GTSi (seasons 2\u20136)\n1984 Ferrari 308GTSi quattrovalvole (seasons 7\u20138)\n\"ROBIN 2\"\n1980 Audi 5000 Type 43 (C2) (seasons 1\u20134; first copy blown up in S1E5)\n1985 Audi 5000 Type 44 (C3) (seasons 5\u20138)\n1974 Jaguar XJ Series II (seen only in season 4, episode 18)\n\"ROBIN 3\"\n1980 GMC Jimmy (full-size K5 \u2014 season 1\u20133)\n1983 GMC Jimmy (mid-size S15 \u2014 seasons 4\u20136)\n1984 Jeep Wagoneer (XJ Model \u2014 seasons 7\u20138)\n\"Robin 23\"\n1981 Ferrari GTSi (green) \u2013 seen only in the 13th episode of the 6th season; \"Summer School\".

The car was previously driven by James Bond in the unofficial 1983 movie Never Say Never Again.\n\n\n=== Aircraft ===\nIsland Hoppers (TC's) helicopter \u2014 Hughes 500D (various models)\nKen Enderlin Charters \u2014 N9267F is a Hughes Model 369HS built in 1975, Construction Number (C/N) 1150778S, in the episodes \"Dream a Little Dream\" and \"Missing Melody\".\n\n\n== Development and production ==\nDevelopment of Magnum, P.I. was originally slated at ABC, which aired other Glen Larson series The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries and Battlestar Galactica. However, in January 1979, ABC cancelled both series, and development on Magnum, P.I.. Larson then took the series over to CBS.Selleck's contract commitment to the Magnum, P.I. series famously cost him the role of Indiana Jones in the first Indiana Jones film, Raiders of the Lost Ark, which went to Harrison Ford. Selleck was unable to take the part of Jones as Magnum was due to start filming in March 1980. Owing to the 1980 AFTRA/Screen Actors Guild strike, production of Magnum was delayed until December 1980, which would have allowed Selleck to play Jones.In the 1986-87 season 7 of Magnum, P.I., Selleck was brought in as a producer and the program was moved from its Thursday night slot on CBS to Wednesday, which increased its slumping ratings from competing with The Cosby Show on NBC.\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n\n=== Crossovers ===\n\n\"Ki'is Don't Lie\" \u2014 Magnum works with the Simon brothers to recover a stolen Hawaiian artifact that's supposedly cursed. The plot concludes on Simon & Simon in the episode \"Emeralds Are Not a Girl's Best Friend\".\n\"Novel Connection\" \u2014 Jessica Fletcher comes to Hawaii when an attempt is made on the lives of Robin's guests. The plot concludes on Murder, She Wrote in the episode \"Magnum on Ice\".For re-run and overseas purposes, the first half of these crossovers (the Magnum episode) also had alternate endings filmed, which wrapped the story up in a single episode and so allowed repeat showings as \"stand-alone\" stories rather than two-part crossovers.One mooted crossover from later in the series' run was with the CBS vigilante drama The Equalizer, starring Edward Woodward as the retired spy Robert McCall. According to Equalizer executive producer Coleman Luck, interviewed for a special-feature documentary on The Equalizer, the crossover was proposed by Universal Television and was opposed by the Equalizer production staff.\n\n\n== Home media ==\nUniversal Studios has released all eight seasons of Magnum, P.I. on DVD in Region 1, 2 and 4. On October 1, 2013, Universal released Magnum, P.I. - The Complete Series on DVD in Region 1. The 42-disc set features all 162 episodes of the series as well as bonus features.On December 12, 2016, in the United Kingdom, the complete series was released in HD on Blu-ray.In Australia, Madman Entertainment has re-released all eight seasons on DVD from November 18, 2015 - June 20, 2018, followed by \"The Complete Series\" on October 9, 2019.\n\nRegion 2 release dates refer to the United Kingdom market only.* Includes the crossover Season 2 episode from Simon & Simon titled \"Emeralds Are Not a Girl's Best Friend\".\n** Includes the crossover Season 3 episode from Murder, She Wrote titled \"Magnum On Ice\".\n\n*** Includes the bonus Season 5 episode from The Rockford Files titled \"White on White and Nearly Perfect\" featuring Tom Selleck. \n****Includes bonus episodes from The A-Team, Season 2 titled \"Diamonds 'n' Dust\" and Knight Rider, Season 2, titled \"Brother's Keeper\".\n\n\n== Awards ==\nSelleck won an Emmy in 1984 for his portrayal of the title character. Three years later, co-star John Hillerman also won an Emmy. In 1981, series creators and writers Glen A. Larson and Donald P. Bellisario received an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best Episode in a TV Series.\n\n\n=== Golden Globe Awards ===\nMagnum, P.I. was nominated for multiple Golden Globe Awards:\n\n\n=== Primetime Emmy Awards ===\n\n\n=== Other Awards ===\n\n\n== Detroit Tigers incident ==\nOn September 16, 2017, a group of 45 men dressed as Thomas Magnum were ejected from a Detroit Tigers game for smoking and catcalling women in the park.\nThe story quickly became one of international interest as the group, from nearby Allen Park, Michigan gave dozens of interviews to newspapers, magazines, radio stations, podcasts and more.\n\n\n== Proposed sequels ==\nIn October 2013, while being interviewed by Yahoo!, Selleck revealed that Tom Clancy\u2014himself a huge fan of the series\u2014was planning to write a screenplay for a Magnum, P.I. film in the 1990s, serving as a continuation of the show. He also added that Universal Pictures was heavily interested in producing it at the time. The project remained unmaterialized.\nIn September 2016, ABC began developing a sequel from Leverage creator John Rogers and producer Eva Longoria centering on Lily \"Tommy\" Magnum, which never made it to series.\n\n\n== Reboot ==\n\nIn October 2017, CBS announced they had issued a pilot commitment for a reboot of the series, to be developed by Peter M. Lenkov, who has helped reboot other series like Hawaii Five-0 and MacGyver for the network. CBS officially ordered the pilot three months later, along with one for a reboot of another hit 1980s television series for the network, Cagney & Lacey, as well as one for 1990s favorite Murphy Brown.\nOn February 20, 2018, actor Jay Hernandez was cast as Thomas Magnum.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMagnum, P.I. on IMDb\nMagnum, P.I. at TV.com\nMagnum P.I. at epguides.com\nMagnum Mania",

        "wiki": "The Duisburg Zoo, founded on 12 May 1934, is one of the largest zoological gardens in Germany. It is especially well known for its dolphinarium and, since 1994, for breeding koalas.\nFar less well known are the breeding successes in other areas, for example, with fossas (carnivorous mammals from Madagascar) and red river hogs.\nThe zoo is located in the northern part of the Duisburg urban forest on the border with M\u00fclheim on the Ruhr. Federal highway A 3 divides the zoo into western and an eastern parts, which are joined by a leafy country bridge. The highway is scarcely noticeable to the visitors.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Duisburg Zoo was founded in 1934 as the Duisburg-Hamborner Tierpark am Kaiserberg. In 1936, the zoo began to grow from a small animal park with its first (loaned) elephant.  With the beginning of World War II in 1939, the zoo had to be closed. Only in 1946 was the zoo re-opened with animals loaned from the Hellabrunn Zoo in Munich. In 1952, the zoo could register the acquisition of its first elephant. In 1958, a facility for penguins and seals was dedicated by businessman and promoter Helmut Horten. In 1965, one of Europe\u2019s largest dolphinariums was opened in a newly developed area. Research into the behavior of dolphins increased the zoo\u2019s prestige, but also drew sharp criticism, since even the generously dimensioned dolphinarium only managed to offer a small fraction of the space available to a dolphin in its natural habitat.\nDirector Wolfgang Gewalt drew similarly vehement criticism for leading an expedition to supply the zoo with a white whale. In the summer of 2004, the beluga Ferdinand and the Commerson's dolphin Yogi, the last animals of their kind in Duisburg, were flown to SeaWorld in San Diego, California, where they are spending their twilight years in species-appropriate tanks with their others of their kind. Amazingly, the animals, which are the oldest of their kind known, appear to have tolerated the move well.\n In 1970, the animal park renamed itself a \"zoo\" and marked 1978 with the birth of its first dolphin. Besides the construction of a house for kodiak bears (1982), big cats (1985), koalas (1994) and an outdoor facility for gorillas among other things, a city partnership between Duisburg and Wuhan was dedicated with the construction of a Chinese garden complete with fauna. The Duisburg Zoo celebrated its 70 years of existence in May 2004. In recent years, the zoo made efforts to renovate its antiquated enclosures, which caused many species, for example the polar bears, to be given up; there remain facilities which do not  meet contemporary standards. Since September 2005, a new facility for the two river dolphins, dubbed the \u201cRio Negro\u201d, has opened. One of the dolphins died a short time later; the other one is still alive (Apr 2013).\n\n\n== Enclosures ==\n\n\n=== Dolphinarium ===\nThe Dolphinarium is inhabited by 7 bottle-nosed dolphins : Ivo (M), Pepina (F), Delphi (F), Daisy (F), D\u00f6rte (F), Debbie (F) and Dobbie (M). They live in a pool containing about 3 million liters of seawater. It is not cleaned chemically, but with special equipment using air. It is the largest dolphinarium in Germany. Depending on the season, two or three performances take place every day in the large arena. During the week, the dolphinarium is free-of-charge for visitors between performances (but not on Sundays or bank holidays). It regularly offers special treats, such as \"An Evening with the Dolphins\" or \"Zookeeper for a Day\" and weddings or children's birthday parties can be celebrated there. Dolphins have been born and bred in Duisburg several times: Duphi (1988; since died), Delphi (1992), Daisy (1996), Duke (2001; since died) and Dolly (2007, the daughter of Delphi). However, on several occasions the offspring did not reach maturity. In September 2007, Donna, the daughter of Pepina, was born, and she has been on show to visitors since 27 February 2008.\nThe park have also an amazonia dolphin : Baby (M-46 years old).\n\n\n=== Rio Negro ===\nThe Rio Negro was opened in 2005, and is situated in the Tropical House. In a large pool lives the Amazon dolphin Baby - the first of its kind in Europe. The pool is constructed to look almost natural, and is separated from the viewing area by a curved, meter-high glass plate. The house is decked out naturally with wooden flooring, much foliage, and uncaged animals. Previously, another dolphin Apure also lived here; at the time of his death in 2006, he was the oldest known Amazon dolphin in the world, being at least 42 years old. The pool is not intended to be exclusively used for the surviving Amazon dolphin - the plans are that it will be used in the future by manatees after Baby dies.\n\n\n=== Koala House ===\n\nIn the Koala House, glass-fronted area houses these small Australian animals. The koalas are only separated from the visitors by this glass plate. Additionally, general information on koalas and Australia, as well as the story of how the koalas came to be in the zoo, is available. A long-term exhibition of pictures by nature photographer Ingo \u00d6land is also on view, showing the landscape of Australia and its animals in 22 large-format pictures.\n\n\n=== Fossa Enclosure ===\nThe Fossa Enclosure is laid out to imitate the natural habitat of the fossa, with much foliage and several small pools. The breeding program is the largest worldwide, and since 1994, the zoo has coordinated the European preservation program for this species. The enclosure was financed and donated by the Association of Duisburg Zoo Friends (Verein der Duisburger Zoofreunde) in 2000.\n\n\n=== Equatorium ===\nThe Equatorium is the largest section of Duisburg Zoo. It derives its name for housing animals usually found in the rainforests of the equatorial regions, and primarily houses primates. A few years ago, the installation was redesigned and renovated piece-by-piece. In 2002, the Gorilla-Bush, was opened, a large open enclosure for lowland gorillas and De Brazza's monkeys. In the autumn of 2005, the new East entrance opened, behind which one can view the mountain loris in a 'walk-through' enclosure. Visitors can feed these animals daily. Next to the loris enclosure, colobus monkeys also inhabit a natural-looking enclosure donated by Thyssen. Other animals in this section include orangutans, macaques, gibbons, sloths, and pygmy hippos.\n\n\n=== Outdoor Tortoise Enclosure ===\nIn 2006, the Outdoor Tortoise Enclosure was laid out. It is meant to imitate the animals' natural habitat, with many stony burrows for the tortoises to retreat into and foliage in the enclosure for the tortoises to consume. Within the enclosure, there is also a small stream and 'warming shelters': Plexiglass containers into which the tortoises can go to warm themselves up.\nPreviously, the tortoises were housed in the same building as the aquarium, where they had a large enclosure strewn with sand and into which warming lamps were placed.\n\n\n== Ruhrpott-Schnauzen ==\nEveryday life at the Duisburg Zoo can be followed daily on ZDF. This TV channel has broadcast the documentary series Ruhrpott-Schnauzen since June 2006.\nThe last program so far was broadcast on 8 July 2008, and was succeeded from October 2008 by a new program Tierische Kumpel, which relates stories from not just Duisburg but also ZOOM Erlebniswelt in Gelsenkirchen and the Aquazoo D\u00fcsseldorf).\n\n\n== External links ==\nDuisburg Zoo home page\nDuisburg Zoo school home page\nZoo restaurant \u201cZoo Terraces\u201c home page\nBrief portrait of all the important details at Zoo-infos.de\nThe complete presentation of \u201c70 Years at the Duisburg Zoo\u201c from Zoo-AG Bielefeld\nField trip report from Zoo-AG Bielefeld\nZDF-Series \"Ruhrpottschnauzen\" home page\nWebsite about Ferdinand, the Beluga Whale\nZoologischer Garten Duisburg on zooinstitutes.com",

          "On visiting Duisburg on Family business we took time out and visited the zoo. Was very large so the price we thought would be worth it.. We were wrong, hardly any animals on show ( kept getting told they dont force animals out) 3 different times we went back and still didnt see",
          "My partner and i had nothing to do as it was a Sunday and most things are closed in Germany on Sundays so, we decided to go to the Zoo. We were pleasantly surprised by the variety of animals at this Zoo. The enclosures that the animals were in were well kept and a good size for",
          "The terrain of the zoo is divided by a noisy highway, which cannot be overheard. Some enclosures are empty and seem very neglected. There are many areas under construction, so that paths are blocked and you have to take detours. The dining facilities in the zoo are limited to",
          "This is a truly superb place to visit. The day we visited was cloudy and cold. This didn't spoil our day. In December visitor numbers are low, so at times we felt like it was a private viewing. There's places to eat than normal but that was fine. Parts of the zoo are a bit old,",
          "We've been a couple times, once on a sunny day, and once on a rainy day. A main attraction is the dolphin show, which is both informative and entertaining, but there are other animals that make this a nice visit. Seeing the primate area (siamang, gibbons, gorillas, orangutans,",
          "You could easily get lost in the Zoo, even though it's not all that big. This Zoo is a garden, a big park, with lots of exotic animals. Animals are assembled by region and this makes it easier to find what you are looking for. The Chinese garden is beautiful. Overall, it's a",

          "Went here with the family, the parking is a bit down the road and you pay for that and then it is quite pricey on entry. It's a nice zoo, great aquarium area and great play ground as well. The farm area is nice however they should really have hand sanitizer dispensers around",

          "Again we've had a wonderful day, even in February when it was a bit chilly. It is an old zoo, dating back to 1934. Some of the enclosures are smaller as those in younger zoos and somewhat dated - might need updating. Since our last visit in 2016 a new tiger area has been created",

That day was a holiday in NRW, so the zoo was extra crowded, we had to cue for 10-15 minutes, even though we were there early in the morning (it opens at 9 a.m.). Entrance fee is 16.90 \u20ac/adults and 9.90 \u20ac/kids",

          "Zoo is good and well maintained. Dont miss the shows. They are good. Especially dolphin show. Worth visiting.",
          "The zoo isnt very big, but its absolutely worth a visit. Im a huge Zoo fan, Ive visited several zoos in Europe. Duisburg have several animals which one wouldnt expect to see, They've got an albino Bennett's kangaroo for instance. I've also never seen a wolverine or a wombat",
          "There are exhibits where you are up close and personal with the animals, providing curious and refreshing moments of \"who is entertaining who?\" At one point we were in a cage, and some of the animals outside looking at us in what appeared to be an amused fashion. Not cheap, so",
          "I loved my visit to Duisburg zoo. I got to see some animals for first time in my life. I enjoyed seeing the dolphin show.. amazing creatures. Sealions were amusing to see. I saw red pandas too. They have a nice China garden inside the zoo, where few good clicks can be taken.",
          "We ve been there the 16 th December 2015 it was an amazing experience especially if you like annimals and nature you will enjoy it a lot. The zoo is very big and unfortunately we didn't manage to see everything although we spent a full day there.",
          "I was here in winter, and half the zoo seemed to be closed. I saw giraffes, lions, tigers, bears, all the basic stuff. One animal struck me as exceptional, namely the Fossa from Madagascar. A whitish dolphin also looked special - I think it was the Amazon river dolphin.",
          "One of the biggest assets of this zoo are the old trees and the naturally grown environment. It\u2019s a great place for all the animals there. But it is also very nice for the visitors to walk around in this place. The variety of animals is great and from what I could see, the way",

          "Its a very nice place for a day trip, there is a Dolphin show which should not be missed, do note the time at the entrance and follow the zoo trail accordingly, although its mostly for kids but even elders will enjoy. It is easy to reach the Zoo using U-bahn from main station.",
          "Just off the A3, the Duisburg Zoo is easily accessible from all around. Parking can be tricky, given e distance to the zoo from the lots. But the zoo is very pleasant and well shaded. If they would only ban smoking, it would get more stars.",
          "Just back from a visit to Duisberg Zoo and have to say what a great way to spend a day! A lot of animals to see so would recommend an early start, check the times for when to visit each enclosure / area as we watched the lions feeding and the dolphin show. Particularly enjoyed",

          "The zoo in Duisburg is an average old school zoo. It has basic enclosures for the animals and isn't focused on entertainment like Hannover or Leipzig. What I really didn't like is the noise level. The zoo is split in half by a busy highway (Autobahn A3) and this you hear at a",
          "The zoo is located close to the motorway. The car park is located a couple of 100 yards from the main entrance. The zoo is nicely maintained. There is a big variety of animals. If you take your time you'll need about 6-7 hours to see it all, including the dolphin show.",
          "One of our favorite places to bring visitors! Be sure to see the Koala exhibit and the dolphin show- both are definitely something your don't get to see at every zoo! Other favorites are lemur island (love that you can get up close and personal with these adorable animals!) and",
          "I have been coming here since I have been one year old, the tin man is still outside the elephant house, unfortunately the entry fee has gone to an astronomically high of \u20ac25 per adult! Although once inside prices for food and gift shop are affordable. Bit disappointed in all",
          "Be careful when sunlight is gone. It's difficult to find and read the information panels and to get the exit door",
          "Nice sized zoo and pretty well maintained-its hard to compete with the San Diego or the Cincinnati Zoo but this little zoo will not disappoint. I particularly enjoyed the small aquarium with it's nice sized marine aquarium (they had a 7 legged starfish) an otter habitat. I also",
          "Loved the dolphin show and it's great for walks and very educational. Animals did seem happy there and there is lots to do for kids.",
          "It's worth going to Duisburg to see this lovely zoo--the Australian animals and large, medium, and local domestic cats are worth a visit on their own, but the zoo also has a dolphin show and many wonderful birds, ungulates, and, of course, elephants! We loved the zoo postcards",
          "Loved lemur island and the little monkeys who were free to roam in the treehouse area. A huge zoo which I'm sure some of which I missed!",
          "Had an enjoyable day walking around this zoo, unfortunately we left the Dolphins till last and we missed the last show so didn't get to see them. It would have been nice if you could still view them, but if you miss a show the doors are closed and there's nothing to see. Many of",
          "We are a couples from India and this is our first time to the zoo. I loved the way people here maintain the zoos very different from what we see in india. PROS: The animals are allowed more spaces and most of them dont look like they are trapped in a small space. Especially",
          "Overview: The zoo itself is not the easiest place to get to without a car but it isnt impossible, you can travel by train to the city and get a tram which is simple or go by car. The zoo has 2 entrances, back entrance and front. Front entrance parking is small and very limited",
          "This is a wonderful place for nature and animal lovers... super awesome place to relax and have fun with those cute animals.. food is awesome and delicious..",
          "We visited this zoo for the very first time, we took our 4 nearly turning 5 year old. I have found it very difficult in the past to find a zoo which has dolphins. This zoo did not disappoint, from entry to leaving, my little one was in absolute awe and the so where the other two",
          "The zoo was good organised, not very big, some installations were not that big for the animals that held (like the one for the hipos). In general the zoo deserves 4 stars, but it holds koalas, which is pretty hard in nowadays Europe, and that gives the extra star. The koalas",
          "Kids and their parents, grandparents and so on can have a great day at the Zoo Duisburg, Germany. There are dolphins in a Dolphinarium, which make a great show. The gardens are quiet nice and they also have a japanese garden.",
          "We went on a quiet day. It was a long walk from the parking area to the zoo, but at least there wasn't a waiting line. Tickets were only 14.50 and we started walking around. A lot of animals were asleep during the morning, and most of the animals were inside. The animals we saw",
          "It was a cold, blustery, icy day at the zoo for us, and we loved it. Watching the interactions between the staff and some of the animals showed that the zoo keepers care both for the animals, and involving the people attending. Meerkat and sea lion feeding time should be seen,",
          "A nice place to visit with friends and family in a day.Worth watching the dolphin show and the garden",

          "Absolutely loved this zoo and Iv been to many around the world and this tops most of them. I love the amount of animals there are and the way the zoo is open until dusk so you can walk around with nobody else about, which is far more relaxing. The Dolphin show was amazing and it",

          "A must when you are in Duisburg. Good to be reached by tram. In Duisburg zoo you have, beside lots of other animals, koalas, dolphins and meerkat. Once a year there is a runners event where the runners run on the tracks of the zoo along the animals in their cages or theit",

          "We have been exposed to good zoos where we live, and the Duisburg Zoo was a very good zoo. The price was economical, they had good maps to get around, and it was an enjoyable experience. We went primarily for the Dolphin Show, and we were not disappointed. It is in an amazing",

        "wiki": "The Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region (German: Metropolregion Rhein-Ruhr) is the largest metropolitan region in Germany with over 10 million inhabitants. It is of polycentric nature. It covers an area of 7,268 square kilometres (2,806 sq mi) and lies entirely within the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region spreads from Dortmund-Bochum-Essen-Duisburg (Ruhr Area) in the north, to the urban areas of the cities of M\u00f6nchengladbach, D\u00fcsseldorf (the state capital), Wuppertal, Leverkusen, Cologne (the region's largest and Germany's fourth largest city), and Bonn in the south. The location of the Rhine-Ruhr at the heart of the European Blue Banana makes it well connected to other major European cities and metropolitan areas like the Randstad, the Flemish Diamond and the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region.\nThe metropolitan area is named after the Rhine and Ruhr rivers, which are the region's defining geographical features and historically its economic backbone.\n\n\n== Subdivisions ==\nThe largest cities in the Rhine-Ruhr area are Cologne, with over 1 million inhabitants, followed by D\u00fcsseldorf, Dortmund and Essen, which each have a population of over 500,000.\nThere are many different sub-definitions of what belongs to the Rhine-Ruhr area, but the metropolitan area itself has officially defined borders with Hamm in the east, M\u00f6nchengladbach in the west and Bonn in the south and the small city Wesel as its northernmost point. The northern border is similar to the border of the Ruhr Area.\nThe table below shows an unofficial summary of regions. In the official definition the metropolitan area is much smaller.\n\nEurostat's Urban Audit splits the Rhine-Ruhr region into six Larger Urban Zones (LUZ). These six Urban Zones do not cover the cities of Remscheid and Solingen nor the district of Rhein-Kreis Neuss.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nHistorically, most of the Ruhr area was for the most part characterized by heavy industry since the age of industrialisation in the late 19th and early 20th century. Since the Middle Ages, Cologne, Dortmund and other cities were important regional trading cities, but during the 19th century the city of D\u00fcsseldorf grew to become the administrative center of the region and since 1945 its political capital.\nToday, the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region accounts for roughly 15% of the GDP of the German economy, which would place it as the 2nd largest GDP of metropolitan area in the European Union. Despite this size, the Rhine-Ruhr region as a whole often lacks international competitiveness because it lacks a unified presentation. Cities and urban areas within it often pursue separate investment policies against each other.From within, D\u00fcsseldorf, Essen and Cologne are by far the largest economic centers, with specialisation in financial/high tech and insurance/multi media services respectively. Other major economic centers are Bonn and Dortmund. The region is home to twelve Fortune Global 500 companies, among them E.ON AG, Essen, Deutsche Post AG, Bonn, Metro AG, D\u00fcsseldorf, Deutsche Telekom AG, Bonn, ThyssenKrupp AG, Essen/Duisburg, RWE AG, Essen, Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Franz Haniel & Cie. GmbH, Duisburg, Evonik Industries, Essen, Hochtief AG, Essen and the Henkel Group, D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\nThe Rhine-Ruhr area's climate is characterized by having the warmest winters in Germany, especially its western part at the Lower Rhine area. Classified by K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification to be oceanic (Cfb).\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\nThe area has four international commercial airports, and multiple smaller aerodromes for general aviation.\n\n\n=== Road ===\nNorth Rhine-Westphalia has the densest network of Autobahns in Germany.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nThe rail, S-Bahn, U-Bahn and bus companies are administered through a consortium of local and regional transport lines, the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr. It offers a rapid transit system which interconnects all cities and their respective local buses, trams, U- and S-Bahn systems, partly under the umbrella of Deutsche Bahn. Their systems are highly integrated where even some subway lines continue from one city to the next (for example between D\u00fcsseldorf and Duisburg or Bochum and Herne, which is unique in Germany, as the city border is crossed underground).

          "Overlooked by most British people I suspect, but it is really worth a trip out there (by tram) a huge world heritage industrial site, with fantastic museum and knowledgeable friendly staff. The blending of the museum artefacts with the old machinery is particularly well done!",
          "Fantastic area with industrial monuments from coal mining area, great opportunities for a day hike with your camera, there are also restaurants and exhibitions on the area, it is listed as UNESCO heritage since a couple of years",
          "book a guided trip you will not regret it as there is so much to see im a great fan of this place we take all our visitors to see it and they all say the same mind blowing so much information and yet its a fun day out",
          "Our business partner organized a guided tour for us of this interesting site that about an hour or so before our dinner at the site's restaurant. The tour was very impressive as our guide not only knew a lot about the site and its history but also able to explain things in",
          "I took a 2 hour guided tour. Guide was really passionate about his job and explained every single detail about the history of the mine and it`s effect on the Ruhr region.",
          "We took the tour of what was once the worlds largest coal mining and processing location. Unbeleavable that 23,000 tonnes of coal PER DAY was being moved through this facility in its hayday. Well worth taking the tour [in various languages].",
          "This museum is a trip through anthropology. I cannot recommend this site enough. You will be not be disappointed. An absolute bargain for 8 euro",
          "While interesting to an degree, I found myself quickly bored. The industrial setting is intriguing, but I personally am no stranger to the industry and it did not captivate me for long. Expositions within are rather chaotic and large parts of it are focused on the local life",
          "The site itself is pretty big and do not follow a precisely organized \u201cvisit plan\u201d. You just park on one of the parkings that are distributed around the place, find a metal beam built-in the path (it shows you the general direction) and you go around the perimeter to go off the",

          "I didn't really know what to expect but I was stunned by this strange location, the architecture and the vastness. I would say it's worth a visit if you're interested in industrial locations, it's history and architecture. The signs around the area lack some information but the",
          "It's probably the \"world's most beautiful coal mine\" and if you take a tour, for those with a specific interest in Industrial archeology, it is probably a fascinating experience. However , as a site of \"general\" tourist interest it has some shortcomings. The site is very large",

          "A very interesting experience. You can easily spend a whole day here to get a feel for what it was like during the height of the mining time in the Ruhrgebiet. Highly recommend!",
          "Very organized museum. The visit is very interesting with interactive videos of coal mining operation. The guide explains everything very carefully and the coffee is very yummy! Highly recommend the tour.",
          "It's an amazing place concerning big area to visit. Be prepared, it's a wide walk. However, I felt a lack of directions. There is some maps, but I cannot see too much help. I recommend.",

          "When I told my wife I had reserved 2 places for us on the English tour today at the coal mine my wife didn't exactly go yippee. But we had such a fascinating insight into the life of a coal miner and how coal was extracted and processed in this area. For 2 hours we were",
          "It does not matter whether you are for or against fossil, probably if you're against this will reinforce that view. That does not block the fact that this site, half a village in size is extremely impressive and worth visiting. Even on a gloomy day.",
          "Former coal mine is preserved as a UNESCO site and you can wander around, take a guided tour, or visit the museums. First, I spent about two hours doing the walk around the perimeter of the site. The buildings and mining equipment are huge. For some buildings, I could guess at",

          "Coal mining is what drove the Ruhr's 'Golden Century' during the industrial revolution - here's a great big (huge !) museum to show you how and why. Explanations in German and English. The only oddity is that they don't show you what happened underground, focusing on the nice",
          "Its a must for all visitors. This mine had shaped the history of Germany and may other coal mining nations. Make sure to visit the Coking plant first and get the timings for English tours which last for a hour mostly. In between you may walking towards the Boiler house which is",
          "To be honest we only managed to scratch the surface of what's on offer at the Zollverein Coal Mine Complex. We only had a couple of hours to spare so looked round the Visitor Centre and then ventured down into the Ruhr Museum. This is amazing with a massive exhibition regarding",
          "A fascinating insight into life working in a coal mine and the conditions the workers endured, particularly in the early days. Good to get a guide to show you the highlights and explain things to you.",
          "This is really a beautiful Unesco building. The expo inside the building gives a good view of the life and history back in the days. You could buy drinks and food in a small kiosk. You don\u2019t have a lot of choice but it\u2019s ok. We\u2019ve spend about 4 hours in the museum.",
          "A must if you visit Essen! Be sure to walk up to the viewing roof. UNESCO heritage and well worth the visit. Wish I had more time to try the restaurant. Not sure if the name, nice ambiance when I popped in to check it out.",
          "A pretty good place to wander around on a nice day and have a walk among some impressive industrial culture. Good place to learn more about it. In summer you can also go swimming around here. There's also no lack of events, so a lot to experience around here.",
          "It is a UNESCO world heritage site. Modern industrial design that changed the world. The timeline was nicely presented so was the transformation of the entire ruhr region. Really impressive industrial and cultural history.",
          "A fantastic place to experience the feel of the industrial heartland of Germany. Free parking, free to walk around the place externally. Great museum built into the place with an average priced entrance fee, but also includes great views of the area and a short movie experience.",
          "A great place to wonder (or bike) around and being impressed by the old industrial mining plant. Not just zolle verein, but the whole region is filled with strange and great plants and old rusty factories. All is easily accessible.",
          "Zollverein is really a nice place and full of education and history. Especially Panaroma was excellent.",
          "A fried who is from Oberhausen took us to this museum, it's very interesting and impressive, but you either need the English tour or someone who can explain what it's about as it's only in German. If you want to make the most of the visit it requires lots of steps to climb.",
          "We didn't know what this facility would be like, but given that it has UNESCO World Heritage status, we thought it would be worth a look. It's a magnificent repurposing of the old coal mining/briquetting complex. The day we visited, it was swelteringly hot; had it been more",
          "The museum is very interesting to tour. Big open spaces left basically left untouched from when it was in operation. Would have gotten a significantly higher rating if all of the information signs hade been written in both English as well as German.",
          "Different and pretty nice! Good presentation in the movie zone. There is also and coffee terase. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Huge area with a lot to see and open 24 hours for free. The industrial complex is well maintained and well worth a visit.",
          "I' ve been there with my husband a few weeks ago because we had read a lot of this place and he is an architect so he was interested in the structure. Being there you can comprehend how many organizated are Germans and how they can work and pull out something from nothing.",
          "This is the one and only place in Essen. If you stop over, this world heritage is a must visit on your list. I you have time try the torch tour through the old facilities. Loving it!",
          "A nice way to show inhabitants and visitors the looks and feels of the brown area of Germany, the Ruhrgebiet. It lacks though life, and points of interest. This explains the spare only visitors one comes across in the area.",
          "Not a typical museum. Be prepared for a lot of walking if you wanna see it all. Lots of things to see, read and learn.",
          "An interesting site. Can't t see the important inner parts, other than the outer architecture, without a tour. A duration of about 2 hrs. 9.5euros. Access to inside the buildings is only assured with a guide. Expressive, impressive, not to be missed while in the area North Rhine",
          "One of the best areas of Essen for tourism, where you can find the Red Dot Design Museum and the old massive mining structures, with a magnificent museum inside.",
          "Very interesting! We were there with family and dog Maxi. Everyone had a lot of fun. Great for a long walk with interesting scenery! Next time we will go into the museum- without the dog!",
          "Highly recommend the tour. You need at least 2 hours here to see everything - probably four is better. Good car parking and there is a cafe. Not really suitable for those with disabilities as you can only visit the main floor. A tour involves a lot of stair climbing.",
          "Had hoped to participate in an English-language tour, but our schedule did not allow it. But it didn't really matter since there is plenty to see here even if you can't read all of the exhibits. Gives a great insight into the industrial heritage of the Ruhr region, and hence",
          "One of the most interesting places in Ruhrarea ! Used to be a coalmine but to day it is a wonderful Museum ,interesting architecture and the most beautiful restaurant.",
          "Zollverein is a great place to get close to the industrial history of the Ruhr area. There are interesting museums and recommended tours that focus on different aspects of the work done here. The view from the top of Kohlenw\u00e4sche brings more interesting insights. Also there is",
          "The '\u00dcber Kohle und Kumpel' (about coal and miners) guided tour is excellent. I had to go on a guided tour in German but on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays they have guided tours in English. During the tour, the guide explained all the processes involved in sorting and washing",
          "I didn\u2019t know what to expect from a visit to Zollverein Coal Mine. Arriving at the site was the first surprise; it is physically an amazingly big site. There are original industrial machinery still in place. These are huge engines and helps to understand how Germany as a",
          "There are not so many attractions in Essen. This one is the best. Check out how the people of this area have worked and lived in the 50s 60s and 70s. Hard stuff. You can find a nice restaurant here. A little pricey but worth a visit.",
          "Great industrial event location to host customer events. Offers great experience, customer tour, good toilet facilities and friendly staff. The plenary room is a bit noisy and this offers room to improve.",
          "Must-see and must-do item. A real eye-opener. We went back 2nd day as we did not finish it all between 11:00 - 17:00",
          "I found it very interesting to learn about this place and very much enjoyed my visit. I thought that it was great to learn about the history of the building and see how it looked inside. In opinion this was a pleasant visit and would recommend this place.",
          "The museum is very interesting and has much to offer for those interested in history (from the beginning of time to the modern era). In addition, you can climb up the stairs to the roof. To start with, there is a nice, orange moving stairway to enter the building.",
          "Informative, step back in time, history and unique. It's not a place I would normally visit but I found it interesting and a unique experience to see how a coal mine operated. It was world listed as a UNESCO site in 2001 and only ceased operation as a mine in 1993. It is",
          "The whole complex is a large maze made out of an old mine. There are many buildings, the Ruhr Museum, Red Dot museum and some others. It's very striking and the photos from the Zollverein are very unusual. My only complaint is that it's a bit difficult to navigate, signposts",
          "Spent more than half a day just on the permanent exhibition - it was really worth it but I'll have to go back for the guided tour when next I am in Essen. It is a really interesting site but I must admit that I am very glad it is no longer in operation as it must've been quite",
          "The large industrial mining site of Essen has been protected and is now open for visit to the public. There are three parkings for cars which enables you to access the site from three different directions. The walking paths around the side are well managed and offer the",
          "The museum is a disused but massive coal mine with a long history. Unfortunately it is no longer possible to be taken underground and the visit is confined to the many buildings and workshops. It is necessary to climb lots of steps but lifts are provided and there is no hurry.",
          "you should see it. long distances to walk but it\u00b4s worth there were also shops with nice objects in industrial design",
          "It's an industrial ruin, which had resuscitated, under a cover of culture and art, without any reference to it's former function. Not worthy of a visit",
          "Very interesting site about the Ruhr's industrial past. Make sure to join one of there guided tours to get the best of it.",
          "We took a guided tour through the Zollverein former coal mine and coke plant. I sort of expected some history of the place and maybe some background information about mining coal and such, and we certainly got that, but we also got so much more. The property is now a hub of",
          "This place is huge - literally, both in times of the main building / museum and the actual grounds. Plenty of parking available and easy enough to find. The only real downside perhaps is support for languages other than German. To be fair, there's a fair bit of support for",
          "I've been walking around the site and looking at many things. It's all magnificent to see, especially considering how deep the mines probably go, you'll feel small. As a lover of all things on rails, my day was also filled with moments of watching around and looking at the old",
          "I understand it is located in a non English speaking part of the world, but there should be more catering to non German speaking tourists that want to appreciate this magnificent story of us humans changing the world with big wheels and hammers of industry",
          "We had booked geat tour of 2 hrs. The guide was very funny with his local dialect but amazingly knowledgeable... Lots of stairs to climb but no special fitness required. Just if you take elderly people not all tours might be suitable. Whatch the webpage for seasonal or daily",
          "Great experience on a guided tour followed by a fantastic dinner. This place is a great example of how you regenerate an old steel works and make a good business out of it. Well done to the tour guides and the chefs alike. We'll be back",
          "This place is interesting. It has own story . There is nice view and inside is like museum... In the tower there is coffe",
          "Always a great place to visit, full of angles and adventures, a good place if you are in an industrial mood, Rhurland Museum is fantastic. It is nice to wander around outside as well!",
          "Huge complex with interesting view. Not much option for non German language as when we came English only available during weekend. Was good though, although inside factory guide took quite so long, nearly 2 hours.",
          "A very nice place, a lot of things to learn...about living there, coal, cokery and more. Impressive!",
          "Beautiful characteristic Industrial memorial, walk around terrains for best experience. Red Dot Design Museum with design prize winning objects in huge 'rusty' factory hall restyled by Norman Foster is also a unique experience. Go there",
          "Definitely worthwhile a visit, it is a tribute to the past of the industry in Germany. Give it a try!",
          "We spent a very interesting day going around this large museum, gaining an appreciation of the hardships undergone by the miners and their families, as well as the destruction cause during the World Wars",
          "Very interesting place, with impressive architecture and so much to learn about the industrial story of the city. We had booked a tour as a family and had a great guide (in German) who was very good at talking to all ages. There is also a fab design museum on site and the site",
          "Visiting from the UK we were unaware of this place until a colleague recommended. This gives a great insight into the mining in the area and a good history lesson of the local areas. Peter our tour guide was very knowledgeable and friendly.",
          "It is a interesting tour especially if you want to see the history of the city Essen. This complex is well preserved and safe to visit. It is my first time to fell so close to a mine.",
          "Very interesting guided tour giving complete picture of history of coal in this area. 8.000km of tunnels in underground.",
          "The industrial past of Germany is rarely on a tourists list. This is recent history of the working heroes which were responsible for the German Economical Miracle after the Second World War. A remarkable place to visit.",
          "We visited the \"Zeche\" in December 2016, mainly for my partner to try out the long ice skating rink specially prepared for the winter. While she was out skating (at a very reasonable seven Euros with no time limits) I had a good walk around the industrial complex, which provided",
          "This place resembles a once fully operational German coal mine of which there have been plenty in the so called \"Ruhrgebiet\". Together with its' support building, it gives a very good impression, how coal mining once worked. The place is UNESCO heritage and this is fully",
          "Really well laid out, fascinating view of Ruhr industry. Great exhibits, excellent helpful staff and good value for money. It takes at least a full day to gain an appreciation of this museum and I'd thoroughly recommend it",
          "Some locations know to force one's respect just by what and how they are. It's the case here, without any doubt. Easy to reach by car or public transportation, the Zollverein is an impressive site that really makes you want to think about the hard working that was done there.",
          "Thanks for saving and adapting this complex for visitors!!! It was amazing to walk around the giant structures and try to image what it was like to work in such a place. The Ruhr museum located in the complex is outstanding.",
          "This is one of the best museum I ever visited. After hundred years those steels can still hold and stand. Remember Essen was one of the biggest mining industry in Germany and in Europe I guess, but after World War Two everything was destroyed.",
          "We have held a couple of events here, up in the old coal hoppers. It is packed with atmosphere, and feels ultra modern in spite of this being such an old historic site.",
          "We had our wedding reception here and had a great night. I live in Essen and loved the place before, but now it's my favourite place. Great surroundings, great architecture, nature, it's overall breathtaking. Go there, it's always worth the visit. The museum Ruhr is great as",
          "Great place for a few hours visit. The tram drops you right outside and as it was sunny, we took the perimeter walk round the entire site. Amazing in the sheer enormous scale of the coal washer and, later on, the coke-making plant. The Ruhr museum was interesting but frustrating",
          "Very interesting, huge site and great history. This must have been an incredible place to see when fully working.",
          "WE took a tour of the coal mine but it was in German since the English tours are only on the weekends. It was very interesting to see the complex. We had read up on it and we were able to ask questions of staff that did speak English. The tour was about 2 hrs long. There is now",
          "Ok, I rarely get disappointed with a world heritage site. But this one! Lacks absolute minimum conditions for a tourist spot. 1- they don't have absolute minimum English information 2- you can't enter the main building without your guides and the tours are mostly offered in",
          "I went here as part of a business function. We booked a private guide and he was excellent in both information given and entertainment. It is a very interesting place to visit.",
          "This tour was offered as an excursion & only a handful of people joined. The remaining passengers thought we were crazy for visiting a coal mine. Turns out to be a very informative & enjoyable day. Fascinating buildings and educational context of Germany during the industrial",
          "We stay at 17.10.2016 at Zeche Zollverein - very competent guide - answer all questions very good. I was getting a good view into the production of coal und the related products. The whole areas has also a very interesting Architecture, which is quite unusual for this type of",
          "The visit of the world heritage place in combination of an company event of Siemens at the Zollverein Zeche is a must if you want to understand how Germany made its industrial comeback after WWII . Here you will understand.",
          "A huge area is recultivated. There are several places to visit. Main museum gives you the spirit of coal mining with huge monuments and machines but you get very interesting information about the history on the interactive exhibitions as well. Coffe bars, rest rooms are",
          "We spent almost the whole day there still not being able to do what we wanted. You can wander around, join organised tours, visit museum or go up to the top to see the panorama of the area. A great place to learn more about history of industrialisation, highly recommended.",
          "Enjoyed an interesting visit to this UNESCO World Heritage site which boasts unique architecture. Taking the long escalator ride (an experience in itself) to the entrance you can the proceed to visit the coal mine museum which is actually a journey through history, Be sure to",
          "Really amazing place, so well preserved. We didn't take one of the tours as we were there for an event but enjoyed wandering around the complex. Kudos to the state for keeping it so lovely.",
          "We did a tour guide on a week day, few people around we could see some interesting spots, but unfortunatey not down to the mine as I expected. It certainly worth the visit.",
          "This is the second time I am taking this tour. In 2001 right when it was included into the UNESCO World Heritage list the museum was amazing. Now the expositions look dated; I wonder if they are properly maintained. I would still give it four+ stars if not for the English guide",
          "It is an architectural and technical masterpiece, earning its reputation as the \u201cmost beautiful coal mine in the world\u201d. Recommend to take a guided tour minimum 90 minutes. If possible, you should spend a day in this beautiful area and enjoy this art of engineers.",
          "This is a fascinating place to visit, especially if industrial settings fascinate you, but even if that is not your thing this is really impressive, its hard to imagine it working, everything is on such a grand scale it is simply impressive. The guided tour is a must, the guides",
          "Good value with art gallery etc.. All the installations are changed regularly and are online..would recommend rainy day activity",
          "We went here with a 5 year old girl and did the family tour which was good for kids all round. I would recommend a whole day here lots to see. Food is standard chips and sausage otherwise I would have given 5 stars.",
          "we did the 4 hour tour through the mine and the cokes factory. The guide was very knowledgeable and was able to tell stories about life in the mines and factories as well as explain the historical facts and production processes. The price (18 euro for the tour) is really",
          "With a friend we decided to visit some Industriekultur attractions. We started in Essen. The entrance is impressive, a huge mechanical staircase is taking you up to the Visitor center. Everything is BIG. This is a great place (in- and outside) to get in touch with rough, large,",
          "Big coal mining industrial complex completely transformed into a nice museum. They managed auite an excpetional collection of itens and visits. It is very appealing to whoever likes history and surely interesting enough to anyone to pictue why and how the ruhr gebiet was so",
          "Zollverein is relatively old mining facility, still partialy active. It was the heart of Ruhr area and leader of German industrialization. It was also the center of Essen development. Today, pars of the facility which are not active are avaliabale for visitors: there is mining",
          "This building gives very fast an idea of how it was working in a coal mine. They have many Events there, so it is very often filled with new stories. I recommend to go a few time in the year. The moving stairways (some say the longest in the world) are a attraction by it's own.",
          "The walking path allows you to see the enormity of the structures. I was excited to take photos of the industrialized buildings and hope that they will show how massive it really is. For being a non-functioning mine, I was surprised by all of the activity. They are in the midst",
          "We actually didn't enter the museum but just walked around and had some lunch at one of the restaurants. We were lucky with a sunny day in April. It was beautiful to see! Although I think it would have looked a bit depressing on a rainy day. It is an awesome sight to see!",
          "One of the first mines in the Ruhr. This beautiful architecture of this turn of the century mine has been spared the ravages of war and the wrecking ball. A must see. A small restaurant (good food) with beautiful historic decor is operated on site. Only two hours are needed.",
          "Old coal mine, former one of the biggest in the mining region; for someone might seem not interesting or not special, but i enjoyed the visit , and our english speaking guide told a lot of things, which i never knew about the region in the times when the mine was operating. So i",
          "Built in Bauhaus style and home to both the ruhr history and Reddot Design museum, this is a place to wonder around a whole day long, Best is to see if you can join guided mine tour to learn about the past of this amazing place",
          "The Zollverein is very interesting! The tours are fairly priced and if you just want to walk around by yourself, it is totally free! The Zollverein has a beautiful park around it with old train tracks that are now out of service. I walked around the whole 3.5km trail and I",
          "We enjoyed the 3-hour \"nachtschicht\" tour. It is only offered on Saturday nights, and is well worth the 18 Euro and three hours -- especially if you are interested in well-maintained relics of an industrialized era soon to be forgotten. I don't think US sites would allow",
          "Enjoyed a lovely day out at Zollverein. Visited the impressive Red Dot Design Museum, got back in time with some typical miners plate at the Kokerei and absorbed the industrial heritage all over the area. We'll be back.",
          "We spent several hours at the complex, first by doing the self guided museum tour. It was quite good, with a little something for everyone. The exhibit, as described, does follow the history of mining in this suburb of Essen. The displays range from a collection of",
          "As a resident of near by city from Zollverein, it still is a great historcial mine site to visit including the Ruhr Museum. It can be accessed by tram line 107, the Kulturlinie.",
          "Museum is interesting but difficult to find your way even with map. Entrance 8 euro, audioguide 3 euro (not really important since you can read the same info on the wall). There is a guided tour at 3pm but no more space for us so I don't know if is good or not.",
          "The place was turned into a great museum. We had booked a nightly tour which was just amazing. Take warm clothes and good shoes inside.",
          "I appreciate it isn't everyone's cup of tea, but if you enjoy industrial structures, this is the one for you. We arrived late in the day and decided to ignore the museum and just take a walk around, three hours later and we had finally finished. Zollverein really is breathtaking",
          "The world cultural heritage of industry is interesting for everybody. All buildings for coal in this mine have now a new function. But the architecture is the same old as it was once. You will find a big interesting museum of culture and technic of mines, coal, steel, lifestyle",
          "I have been there several times and it's still worth a visit. You can visit the museum or just stroll around and get an impression of the mine industrial complex at Zollverein. In winter you can also go ice skating in this special atmosphere.",
          "we were here on a rainy cold day - so we didnt see the outer areas other than the main building and museum. siting a museum in an old mine worked for me ... it was dark with strategic lighting yet despite this it was not gloomy. Enjoyed the industrial setting, and the",
          "We went here with our colleague's out of Germany and i must say we were impressed . They combined coal mine with a huge museum about the environment around Essen and there is so much to see that you must take several hours to make sure you see it all. Do take your time to",
          "We went there and had a quick look around. If the sun had been shining, it might have been more enjoyable. It's an industrial museum; interesting for some, boring for others. Worth a visit, though.",
          "Went here to see art installations and sculpture as advertised on their website, got a tour of Frizt Lang 's Metropolis instead! The weather was atrocious so outdoors wasn't an option, and some art installations were closed. The whole complex is majestically impressive, and",
          "This site is rightfully on the UNESCO World Heritage list. A tour takes you through the production process of 'Koks' from coal. Our tour guide was quite funny with his remarks about the rivals in neighbouring Gelsenkirchen. This part is similar to the tours in Duisburg",
          "We spent almost a full day here. It's been restored brilliantly, and its hard to think that this was an active coalmine less than 20 years ago. The coalmine itself is only part of it, there are several other museums within the whole set up, which make it even more interesting,",
          "I took two tours and both were most interesting with highly motivated and most knowledgable guides. If you are already there, take the chance and visit the design museum too. If you are hungry, then the restaurant is good too.",
          "We went to a wedding reception here but spent the day before exploring. Great Dow the history buffs as well as people interested in how things work! Beautiful property and a great tour! We took the English your and the guide was very informative! The reception site was also",
          "If you're around Essen you must visit the coal mine. It's a perfect spot for photographers to let yourself go especially in the summer. It gives you the chance to see the history of Essen. Outside you can walk for free, the Museum is very cheap though.",
          "If you are any where close to Essen Germany, it is definitely worth taking the time to see the small town of Zollverein and the enormous coal mine --- now a fascinating museum. If you read the popular fiction book by Anthony Doerr you will read about Zollverein and this",
          "This is must visit place if you are visiting Essen, amazing history and visit to the old coal mile. English language tour everyday at 3.00 PM.",
          "The area of former coal mine and coke battery has been rebuilt to into the museum. The area is very large but it is much better to walk arounrd it in a sunny weather.",
          "This is simply a must if visiting either Essen or the Ruhr area. Maintained as an industrial heritage site, long walks, bike rides and many other activities are offered over the expansive coal mining site. Highly interesting and housing a number of fantastic gastronomic",
          "I was not really attracted by visiting a coal mine, but the time spent there was extremely useful. You could start with a little tourist train (every 30 minutes) which allows to see the enormous size of the place from the outside. But you will get a much better insight view when",
          "This is a really interesting place to visit, I was not expecting it to be this nice. It is better to take a conducted tour, Tours are available in English and German, may be also in other languages but not so sure. It is better to check the tour timing before hand from the",
          "Far more interesting than I imagined a coal mine complex would be but definitely should be seen. Design museum was stunning.",
          "The Coal Mine Museum was great with the guided tour. It is quite extensive and was in German only (Luckily we had a friend who helped translate for us). It is quite a bit of walking, so have comfortable shoes on. It was about 2hrs long. We also went to the Red Dot Museum for the",
          "Two wonderful museums ( the Ruhr Museum provides an excellent activity bag for kids with a fun quiz and additional equipment). Well-stocked shop, small cafe. Very interesting sight, lots of historical buildings telling the story of mining.",
          "Half a day spent on this site, visiting the Ruhr and Red Dot Design Museums and spending most of our time walking around the buildings to enjoy a bright shiny day. Site is free and so is parking, lots of spaces available. Fee required for both museums and well worth it,",
          "We eventually found the Zollverein Coal Mine Museum site, the GPS took us in the general direction but the signage is appalling, there is nothing to tell you where to park or where to start touring. It is a big sprawling site - it may be a UNESCO heritage site - but it would",
          "In a spectacular setting, good restaurant with easy access and free of charge --> more than just a lunch meeting. Went for a stroll among the great industrial monuments",
          "We were really intrigued with this place - very well preserved and so interesting. Easy to get around and explore freely.",
          "Essen is a symbol of change. From heavy steel and coal industry to service oriented business. Essen was nearly erased in the 2nd world war for the bin a major war industry location. Nowadays Essen is rewarded with titles like Unesco heritage for Zeche Zollverein, European",
          "I visited this attraction recently as part of a trip to the region. I had never really experienced anything like it and knew very little about coal mining in the Ruhr, except for the fact that it had been a major industry in the area. The scale was enormous and the tour was very",
          "You can participate to a guided tour by paying some fees and know its history and past period of the Ruhr-gebiet. You can have a look to all the previously used machines, techniques, tools and devices that was used some 40-60 years ago. For your information, you can find",
          "If you want to get a history lesson old Essen, this is a great place to go. And if you go up to the tower, you can see the red of the city at a birds eye view. It's not a destination on its own, but if you're in the area, it's definitely worth a visit.",
          "The coal mine was shut down in 1986. Today this is a UNESCO Heritage place, this was the first industrial monument. Museums, small restaurant, caff\u00e9, artist are using today the facility. Actually we wanted only visit one of the museums, but we spent almost the entire day there.",
          "We visited for a couple of hours on a quiet Wednesday in early July, so couldn't take advantage of all that this site offers but we had a restaurant-quality meal with really friendly service in the atmospheric Kokerei cafe and were free to wander and explore the perimeter of",
          "We did not pay to get the full experience - but it's quite interesting even if you only watch the free stuff! Very worthwhile to visit!",
          "This is a large coal mine, coal washing and coking plant that has been wonderfully preserved and interpreted. The tours of the site are very interesting and the bookshop has some great books on the region's industrial history.",
          "Zollverein offers a in depth look into the Ruhrgebeit culture. They offer tours and exhibitions in the museum that are always interesting and change periodically. Be sure to check out the special exhibitions when visiting the Zollverein!",
          "Great place for those who love industrial history. I love the way how the different facilities are placed in the existing industrial spaces. The place is really huge, a guided tour is very recommended.",
          "It was my best visit of the year. The Museum is big and very interesting with a historical and geological exhibitions. If you want to see something real and great you have to go there !",
          "Very impressive coal mine. Would definitely suggested to have a guided tour! Our tour guides name was Dr. Heinz something something. Do ask for him - he made the tour super interesting and had some very good jokes to tell :D Extremely disappointed by the restaurant the Kokerei.",
          "Seriously, it's nice, took it as a part of orientation week through a study exchange program in Essen and felt like.... common 10-20 minutes are enough. The never ending JB 007 style escalator is interesting haha, the waterfall with the coats after the tour was fun for some, but",
          "You don't see this kind of attraction everywhere. It was interesting. It's on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites.",
          "I have been here for many times. Always amazed how German people can transform this factory to such nice museum. 1. Educational, teach and show people how to process coal, the achievements of engineering 2. Entertainment, nice place to have a meal, lunch for business,",
          "It's just amazing place, especially for those like us that just love industrial tourism. You can easily spend the whole day there since there's also some food there :-) The only thing which is confusing is where to get and how to get the full picture what and when to do. The",

          "Though many refer to this as the Eiffel Tower of the Ruhrpott, I would say the Eiffel Tower is the Zeche Zollverein of Paris! This was build not as a vanity project but to dig real coal of of the ground to make electricity and gas. Amazing! What's more at its peak it had 5,000",

          "If you like industrials and infrasture areas of the 1920', you will love this place! Zeche Zollverein was the most powerfull coal mine over many decades. The big tower in the middle is the center of 3 great minetunnels. You can take a walk through the whole area of mining & the",

          "I just went there a few days ago. It was great! I brought my student card (I am from Indonesia) and I got student ticket so it was cheaper. The officers were all nice, friendly and helpful. And the most important thing is the museum was so great, you can learn a lot, everything",
          "Even if you don't have any particular intense in coal or the industry there is enough here to entertain most people for a couple of hours. I can see why it's a World Heritage site. The buildings are incredible in a strange and fascinating kind of a way. Massive, now silent,",
          "This world heritage is wonderful. My dad used to work in a different mine and it was a great experience visiting this museum with him and listen to all his fascinating stories while actually seeing all the equipment used to mine and wash coal. It was neat seeing videos about the",
          "Staggeringly enormous but beautifully designed mine and coke washing plant. The escalator that takes you to the top of the coke washing plant which now houses the museums is an experience in itself. We were able to explore the building and visits the various museums, as well as",

          "Complex is massive and worth seeing the mines buildings and the coke plant. Difficult to explain unless you see it. However one of the power plant buildings is converted into a design museum. Everything is in German and English. Six Euros entry and worth every penny as the items",

          "I visited with a couple of friends out of curiosity. It's quite a large complex so I would schedule for at least 3 hours of visit. We went from 12pm-4pm in the afternoon but still didn't get to see one of the exhibitions. They have various exhibitions planned throughout the year",
          "The city of Essen is trying hard to reinvent itself as an art center. It is a work on progress. We were there during the week and it was fairly deserted. The grounds are interesting but if you're pressed for time, this is probably something that can be missed.",
          "The tour of the coking plant was very well designed and delivered. Although the space is huge, the content and activities throughout are entertaining to the point that we did not notice how quickly 2.5 hours went by. Some basic fitness is required to climb up and down those",
          "I visited just out of curiosity, and was positively impressed. The complex is HUGE and there is plenty of stuff to do. On top of my head of things to do: - Two potential tours, once for the Coal Mine main building (2 hours, 9 euro) and another for the Coal Heating Plant. I",

          "In my opinion this place is a way overrated. The food was just fine, nothing outstanding, not worthy of its price, and a ham served before the main course I believe wasn't fresh, me and my friend had stomach ache after. However, I wouldn't be so strict if it wasn't that expensive. For the services they claim I expected more.",

        "wiki": "Krefeld ( KRAY-feld, -\u2060felt, German: [\u02c8k\u0281e\u02d0f\u025blt] (listen)), also spelled Crefeld until 1929 (though the spelling was still being used in British papers throughout the second world war), is a city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is located northwest of D\u00fcsseldorf, its centre lying just a few kilometres to the west of the river Rhine; the borough of Uerdingen is situated directly on the Rhine. Because of its economic past, Krefeld is often referred to as the \"Velvet and Silk City\". It is accessed by the autobahns A57 (Cologne\u2013Nijmegen) and A44 (Aachen\u2013D\u00fcsseldorf\u2013Dortmund\u2013Kassel).\nKrefeld's residents speak Hochdeutsch, or standard German, but the native dialect is a Low German variety, sometimes locally called Krefelder Plattdeutsch, Krieewelsch Platt, Plattdeutsch, or sometimes simply Platt. The Uerdingen line isogloss, separating general dialectical areas in Germany and neighboring Germanic-speaking countries, runs through and is named after Krefeld's Uerdingen district, originally an independent municipality.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nRecords first mention Krefeld in 1105 under the name of Krinvelde.\nIn February 1598, Walburga, wife of Adolf van Nieuwenaar, and last Countess of Limburg and Moers, gave the County of Moers, which included Krefeld, to Maurice, Prince of Orange. After her death in 1600, John William of Cleves took possession of these lands, but Maurice successfully defended his heritage in 1601. Krefeld and Moers would remain under the jurisdiction of the House of Orange and the Dutch Republic during the Dutch Golden Age. The growth of the town began in that century, partially because Krefeld was one of few towns spared the horrors of the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648). The town of Uerdingen, incorporated into Krefeld in the 20th century, was less fortunate, almost ceasing to exist, destroyed at the hands of troops from Hesse during the Thirty Years' War.\nAfter the death of William III of Orange in 1702, Krefeld passed to the Kingdom of Prussia. The Battle of Krefeld occurred nearby in 1758 during the Seven Years' War. Krefeld and Uerdingen were included within the Prussian Province of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg in 1815 (after 1822 the Rhine Province).\nIn 1872 Krefeld became an independent city within Rhenish Prussia. In 1918 during the First World War the Belgian Army used it as a base during the occupation of the Rhineland. In 1929 Krefeld and Uerdingen merged to form Krefeld-Uerdingen; in 1940 the name was shortened to simply Krefeld.\n\n\n=== The Mennonites of Krefeld ===\nFrom 1607 Mennonites arrived in Krefeld, as in nearby Gronau, from neighboring Roman Catholic territories where they were persecuted. They sought refuge in the lands of the more tolerant House of Orange-Nassau, at the time rulers of Krefeld; in 1657 their congregation was officially recognized and in 1693 they were allowed to build their own church, although hidden in a back yard (which still exists, reconstructed after World War II, with about 800 members). Also the Quaker Evangelists received a sympathetic audience among the larger of the German-Mennonite congregations around Krefeld, Gronau, Emden and Altona, Hamburg. In 1683 a group of thirteen Mennonite families (twelve of them Mennonite-Quakers) left Krefeld to re-settle in Pennsylvania in order to enjoy religious freedom. They crossed the Atlantic on the ship Concord, and founded the settlement of Germantown (now incorporated in Philadelphia), invited by William Penn, and thus beginning the Pennsylvania Dutch ethnic identity. The most important Mennonite family of Krefeld were the silk merchants and silk weaving industrialists Von der Leyen who, by 1763, employed half of Krefeld's population of 6,082 in their factories. Their residence, built from 1791, is the current City Hall.\n\n\n=== The Jews of Krefeld ===\nJews were listed as citizens of Krefeld from 1617. In 1764 a synagogue was erected, and by 1812, under French rule, the town included 196 Jewish families, with three Jewish-owned banks.  Under Napoleon, the town became the capital for the surrounding Jewish communities including over 5000 Jews, and by 1897 they comprised 1.8% of the population. In 1846 a Jewish representative was voted onto the town's municipal council, while rising antisemitism was noted during these elections. A reform synagogue was built in 1876, arousing opposition from the Orthodox community. A Jewish school existed in the town, with more than 200 students around 1900.In November 1938 during Kristallnacht, the two synagogues were attacked. In 1941 following an order from Hitler to deport the German Jews to the east, Jews from the town were sent to the area around Riga and murdered there. In 1945, the U.S. Army occupied the city and placed Henry Kissinger, then an Army private and later Secretary of State of the United States, in charge of the city administration.In 2008 a new synagogue, library and Jewish cultural center were erected on the location of one of the demolished synagogues. Around 1100 Jews were reported to live in and around Krefeld at the time.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nOn 11 December 1941, during World War II, a detailed report on the transport of Jews from Krefeld and its surroundings listed 1007 Jews from Krefeld and Duisburg, were deported to the \u0160\u0137irotava Railway Station near Riga, later to become Jungfernhof concentration camp. They were transported in freezing conditions with no drinking water for more than two days. Almost immediately upon arrival they were shot in the Rumbula forest massacre.On 21 June 1943 British bombs destroyed many buildings in the east part of the city; a firestorm consumed large parts of the city center (apart from the central train station, which remained intact apart from minor damage). On 3 March 1945 US troops entered Krefeld, among them the later U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.During the Cold War, the city was host to the 16th Signal Regiment of the United Kingdom's Royal Corps of Signals stationed at Bradbury Barracks. The town became part of the new state of North Rhine-Westphalia after World War II.\n\n\n== Points of interest ==\n\nLinn Castle (German)\nBotanischer Garten Krefeld, a municipal botanical garden\nKrefeld Zoo\nLange and Esters Houses, neighbouring houses by early Mies van der Rohe, now serving as local contemporary art museum venues\nKaiser Wilhelm Museum, contemporary art museum\nGerman Textile Museum\nGalopprennbahn Krefeld, horse racing track\nThe well-preserved historic old towns of the formerly independent districts Uerdingen, Linn and H\u00fcls\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\nThere are a number of districts in Krefeld.

They are served by Intercity, Regional-Express and Regionalbahn trains. The D\u00fcsseldorf-based Rheinbahn operates a Stadtbahn service to the centrally located Rheinstra\u00dfe stop. This line was the first electric inter-city rail line in Europe, established in 1898, and commonly called the K-Bahn because of the letter \"K\" used to denote the trains to Krefeld. Nowadays, in the VRR notation, it is called U76, with the morning and afternoon express trains numbered as U70, the line number there coloured red instead of the usual blue used for U-Bahn lines. The term K-Bahn, however, prevails in common usage.\nThe city of Krefeld itself operates four tramway and several bus lines under the umbrella of SWK MOBIL, a city-owned company. Since 2010, 19 of the oldest trams of the type Duewag GT8 were replaced by modern barrier-free trams of the type Bombardier Flexity Outlook. SWK Mobil owns an option to buy another 19 trams of the same type to replace the last 19 Duewag M8 trams. The whole tram fleet will then be barrier-free. Next to that the city plans to extend the line 044 in Krefeld-H\u00fcls to connect the northern district of H\u00fcls with the Krefeld downtown area.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe headquarters of Fressnapf, a pet food retailer franchise company, are situated in Krefeld.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\nSince 1964, the city has hosted an \"honors program in foreign language (German) studies\" for high school students from Indiana, United States. The program annually places approximately thirty carefully selected high school juniors with families in and around Krefeld for intensive German language training. Since 1973, the fire services of Krefeld and twin city Leicester have played each other in an annual 'friendly' football match.\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\nKrefeld is twinned with:\n\n\n== Notable natives ==\nScientists:\n\nCharlotte Auerbach (1899\u20131994), genetic scientist, born here\nRudi Dornbusch (1 December, 8 June 1942 \u2013 25 July 2002), economist\nMax Zorn (6 June 1906 \u2013 9 March 1993 in Bloomington, Indiana), mathematician\nLeopold L\u00f6wenheim, (1878\u20131957), German logicianWriters, poets and journalists:\n\nBernhard Hennen (born in 1966), German best-seller writer of fantasy literature\nKurt Feltz (14 April 1910 \u2013 3 August 1982 in Majorca), poet\nWerner Ross (1912 in Uerdingen \u2013 2002), German writer\nOtto Br\u00fces (1 May 1897 \u2013 18 April 1967), journalist\nBodo Hauser (1946-2004), journalist and writer\nMargarethe Schreinemakers (1958), German television presenter and journalistMusicians:\n\nMaria Madlen Madsen (23 March 1905 \u2013 23 March 1990), opera singer\nSilent Force, prog/classical \"epic\" rock band\nBlind Guardian, popular German heavy metal band\nSaki Kaskas, video game music composer\nEveron, German progressive metal band\nRalf H\u00fctter (20 August 1946), lead singer of electronic music pioneers Kraftwerk\nAquagen, popular German trance and eurodance artists\nHeinrich Band (1821\u20131860), inventor of the bandone\u00f3n\nAndrea Berg, (born 1966), popular German singer\nCosmic Gate, popular German trance duo\nAlbert Dohmen (born 1956), opera singerArtists:\n\nTheo Akkermann (1 November 1907 \u2013 1 August 1982), sculptor\nJoseph Beuys (12 May 1921 \u2013 1986), artist\nHeinrich Campendonk (3 November 1889 \u2013 9 May 1957 in Amsterdam)\nAlbert Oehlen, artist\nMarkus Oehlen, artist\nMarc Margielsky, artistAviators:\n\nFelix Kracht (1912\u20132002), aerospace engineer, an Airbus pioneer and former Senior Vice President\nWerner Voss (13 April 1897 \u2013 23 September 1917), German World War I aviator\nEmil Sch\u00e4fer (17 December 1891 \u2013 5 June 1917), German World War I aviatorAthletes:\n\nMartin Hyun, German and U.S. hockey player\nFrank Schwinghammer, a German and Canadian hockey player\nPhilip Hindes, a British sprint cyclistKnights Cross Holder:\n\nHeinz Harmel (1906\u20132000)Other:\n\nCarl Josef Kleingrothe (1864\u20131925), photographer in Medan, Sumatra.\nThierry Herm\u00e8s, German-born French businessman and founder of Herm\u00e8s (1801\u20131878)\nBernd Neumann, German-born American producer, entrepreneur and co-founder of MaxCDN (1966\u20132020)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website  (in German)\nKrefeld-Linner Flachsmarkt\nKrefeld Ice hockey team\nKFC Uerdingen\nStadttheater Krefeld",

          "Very big place to visit. Not all exhibitions were open did to covid. Hardly any guests, no queues so it was pleasant. No whales though, just dolphins and small sharks",
          "It is a lovely place but some of the areas are closed because of COVID-19.",
          "My husband and I visited the aquarium today and although it was nice, it is definitely not worth \u20ac26 per ticket for just the regular aquarium experience. We assume it's because of the low season, but there were major exhibits closed for \u2026",
          "It is a beautiful aquarium, with a big tank with dolphins and another with sharks, this are the highlights. As a negative the tour ends quite fast considering the price",
          "Very lovely experience and you have to visit here that you can enjoy with your family. Kids will be very excited to see all things there. The adult ticket price is 27\u20ac and above and under 14 it will cost 18\u20ac, but if you book early adult price it will be 18\u20ac. And there are so many family packages and you can see them at the counter.",
          "The first half is pretty dire. Very crowded and the fish tanks are distressingly small. It picks up for the second half with a much better layout. Hard to believe this is the largest aquarium in Europe. I've seen much better ones. You're done in about 2hours.",
          "I thought it would be better if we could touch dolphins.\nIt was needed about two hours to see all.\nI think that it is a good aquarium, but I don't think it is a bit better than some aquariums in Japan.",
          "If you live in Italy or are visiting the north, you need to come to this aquarium.   Fun for the whole family.  Watch out for the Mickey Mouse\u2019s in front, they will harass you for money and give your kids  balloons to try and get you to \u201cdonate\u201d",
          "Very small spaces for the number of animals that had the fish tanks, many people taking pictures with flash damaging the vision of the animals and children touched open fish tanks without any control and protection over the sea creatures. \u2026",
          "Great place to visit! I loved the focus on the educational and conservation work they do. Well laid out, with a couple of busier areas around the more popular attractions such as the baby manatee but that is to be expected!",
          "This place was neat, lots of fish and other little critters. Only down side was the dolphin exhibit... it was sad to see them swimming in endless circles. Maybe a bigger area for them would fix that.",
          "Exceptional variety of fishes and sea animals. Very clean everything and excellent treatment of the animals by the staff. You can touch the manta rays",
          "Much to see. 2 adults, 2 children (8 and 2 years) 75 Euros entrance.",
          "This was a wonderful place to visit! They have many different creatures to see, with information boards in English. The manatees were the highlight for me, but the dolphins and penguins were also lovely to see. It was not too busy which is \u2026",
          "A normal large aquarium. My son and I entered, with the usual base ticket, and did not enter any of the for-pay side exhibits. We enjoyed watching the dolphins, manatees, and sharks. You can buy tickets online but we used the ticket counter out since it was not busy in January 2020.",
          "It is a very big aquarium with a hell lot of fishes that look so beautiful and amazing. It was a fantastic experience for my whole family and took us more than half a day to see the complete aquarium. It is worth the money and once in a \u2026",
          "The Aquarium of Genoa (in Italian: Acquario di Genova) is the largest aquarium in Italy .[2] Located in the old harbor area of Genoa, Italy, the 33,000-square-foot (3,100 m2) aquarium is a member organization of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA), and welcomes more than 1.2 million visitors each year.",
          "It's a very open and nice place I live near there",
          "I love fishes and it shows a lot of types of fishes swimming in front of you..i recommend this to the tourists all foreigners and local",
          "Well was so beautiful, I think a bit expensive but once you have to go and see it! Great experience for all ages, for kids and everyone! Takes a few hours to go through definitely. Try to get a combination ticket with a maritime museum. Great deals online too! Have fun and thank you for the aquarium of Genoa!\u270c\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd70",
          "I visited like 10 times and everytime have the \"wow\" factor",
          "The aquarium is quite simple and didn't impressed me. The place was a bit old, staff was rude and there's nothing different to see than other aquariums. I personally didn't like it that much, nothing new and stimulated to me.",
          "Very good for both adults and children and if you time it right you can see them feeding dolphins.",
          "Big aquarium, very nice. Beautiful place.",
          "Amazing place, especially for children. A lot of interesting animals like seal, sea horses, dolphins, sharks, swordfish, pinguins ets.",
          "Lots of things to see and a good place to bring the families to learn about the ocean. I am a bit concerned about the shark tank though, the area seems small and some of the sharks has visible scare on the nose that seems to be results of \u2026",
          "Not the nicest aquarium, but overall nice facility. I really enjoyed seeing the Mantis! Was the first time I saw some in person, the Dolphin aquarium was also pretty cool. \n\nThe admission was a little pricey at 30\u20ac per person. We spent 2 hours at the site, I couldn\u2019t imagine spending more than 4 hours here.",
          "Compared to the Barcelona and Valencia aquarium it\u2019s quite small and animals look.... sad:( the variety is without doubt very big However I think they made it look big with the corridors that lead from one room to another. The dolphins were \u2026",
          "The expo is good. It is however slightly disappointing to purchase a ticket for 26\u20ac and then find out about a 2-3\u20ac paywall for some parts of the exhibition, which was not clearly stated up front.",
          "It's an amazing huge aquarium with a lot of sea creatures, which could be observed in almost natural environment. A lot of additional very interesting information is also provided. It's a must place to visit in Genova for all ages. The price is unfortunately could be something less. Please count at least 3 hours for a visit.",
          "Europe's biggest aquarium with unique species you won't see anywhere else, and a huge variety of animals to see. A fantastic aquarium in great condition who obviously care a lot for their animals. The route through the exhibits flows well \u2026",
          "I like it bu not much means its very costly butt fun is 50% of its cost \ud83d\ude1c i suggest price should reduce .. when price will be low i think more tourists will approach \ud83e\udd14  or add something more interesting ..",
          "It's huge,  it's detailed, it's informative, it's inexpensive and the exhibits are exquisite",
          "Not so much species to see. Service was good and acceptable. Area was clean and organized. Great place for the kids.",
          "\u039dice place with beautiful species. Quite big with many different tanks to see. Not so many 'feeding times' but loved the tanks where you coukd touch few fishes.\nThe cons are the expensive ticket, 26 euro, the fact that presentations (eg. \u2026",
          "The ticket has variable prices depending on the day and the number of tourists. Also the price at the ticket office is different than the one mentioned on the oficial website. We paid 27 euro/person in the mid of September. I expected it to be longer, larger, more interactive and with at least one tunnel surrounded by water...",
          "The best aquarium I have ever been to. Every sea creature I could think of and an easy to follow layout.",
          "Up there with the best in the world , I mean it .",
          "Our private tour guide Davide was incredibly knowledgeable about every aspect of marine life.  He was amazing at handling our group of 14 reuniting family members all chatting and asking questions from every direction.  Bravo Davide!!  Highly recommended.",
          "A great attraction. Animals in captivity are always a sad thing, although this a very educative and well thought venue.",
          "Lots to see. Great for kids. A bit pricey. Check out times for dolphin show/feeding and penguins. Enjoyed our visit.",
          "This aquarium was huge.It took approaximately 3 hours to roam and watch all the sea creatures inside.A good place to visit and spend time.Worth visiting this aquarium \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c",
          "Such a beautiful place to visit! Came here to celebrate my daughters 16th birthday!",
          "Crazy expensive - 29\u20ac per adult (and from 12 y.o. you are an adult!)  and you'd need to pay extra for additional stuff inside. Interesting but a bit sad at the same time. The sea animals don't deserve it. Maltese aquarium is much better in my opinion (also way less expensive).",
          "The bigest in EU just cool",
          "The biggest and best equipped in Europe for what I've seen. A great way to spend the day in genova.",
          "While in Genova the Aquarium is a MUST to visit. The ticket cost was \u20ac26 but completely worth it. At the time I enter they had dolphins show and shark feeding. It was so amazing to see and learn a lot about the sea animals. Another thing I \u2026",
          "I can't tell you how much I enjoyed aquarium of Genoa it is such a beautiful and full of amazing creatures in the water. You can see from the smallest creature to the largest sharks, dolphins sea lions. It is a must visit for every tourist that used to Genoa. I will recommend it 1000 times even if you have seen it before.",
          "It is a very large aquarium, housing a lot of tanks. It took us around 4 hours to walk through reading most of the info at each tank, and not stopping to eat/drink. We went around 10.30 on a Wednesday - no queues to get in, but was quite \u2026",
          "Infrastructure structure, technology and modern space! Very nice place to go with your family!",
          "Genoa us a marvelous city. This aquarium is located in the old, historic port in a ship. It's quite clever.  Many different geographic areas are covered. Snacks of course. Two places for lunch. The fast food type place was noisy but the \u2026",
          "Unique place to take your kids and friends to this spectacular Aquarium. It is rather large. It has fish from the Barrier reefs, etc as well as manatees from India, and several kind of jellyfish. It is the largest in Europe.",
          "Interesting place. A lot of space and they take care to have things for the little ones....but is sad to see the old Genova declined",
          "Biggest in Europe. Did not fall short on the amount of displays. Allow at least 2 hours to go round without a stop for food or drink. Some displays looked a bit tired but they are adding new things like the VR experience which my kids loved. Visited on a Sunday just before lunch. Started to get busy by early afternoon.",
          "Good day out well set out",
          "Big aquarium with so much to see! Best to go in the morning as it is an all day experience. There is a family friendly restaurant at the back of the aquarium with outside seating. The dolphin show was great and you can watch from the top or the bottom of the aquarium.",
          "Aquarium of Genova \nIs a best place to visit \ud83d\udc4d",
          "The best aquarium I've been to, can't believe they have manatees! Wonderful place, very clean, friendly, catered for many different languages around the whole building. It's actually partly on a ship which is incredible! So many incredible \u2026",
          "Awesome place. You can admire dolphins and sharks...",
          "Good and sea life informative place for all kid family and other visitors",
          "First of all it is criminally overpriced and that of course influenced my rating a lot. Too crowded with bad ventilation and worse air conditioning. Yes there is some interesting stuff to see but you cannot because they do not care about \u2026",
          "Really good experience. The best one we visited so far. On Saturday at 2pm in the end of June there were no too much people inside which we were afraid of while buying tickets.",
          "Had an amazing experience. I had an experience of walking along the sea life, with the sea animals and a few terrestrial animals. There's multiple option for food and drinks. A person also take a photo for us. Had an amazing time",
          "A \"must seen\" in Genova. Parking just in front (don't let you guide to the parking, these are thiefs!) Enjoy the amazing exhibition and scenery. \ud83d\ude0e\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9\ud83d\ude0a",
          "Nice aquarium but the entrance is quite pricey. On top of that, you need to pay extra (2\u20ac) to access special areas like rain forest or use a VR Headset.\nIt is still nice, but I enjoyed the one in Barcelona much more. Here there is not much for education or for children to interact with.",
          "Didnt like it at all. Dolphins basin is much too small. Too many people to enjoy animals who lives in cages. No thank you. This was the last time i visited a zoo or similar.... its horrible.",
          "Plan in advance but this is a must go place.\nDolphins, murenas and also penguins are great performers.\nPools are recreating the environment of all the different seas on earth.",
          "Loved playing with the seal ..do visit and say hi to him!!",
          "Great visit do not park in front or it will cost you 50 euros for 24h",
          "This is a nice aquarium in the centre of the city.",
          "Good atmosphere there for hanging out with friends and family..",
          "A great place to spend time with family and friends. Kids would love this place. \n\nBuying tickets online can save losing time in long lines, especially during summer. Students must ask for discounts at the ticket counter. Normal ticket price for adults is \u20ac26 (\u20ac27 on weekends and holidays). Students can go in for \u20ac18.",
          "I was in Genoa for a day, after disembarking from a 12-night cruise. Wanting to see a few of the \"must see\" places, I decide to check this one out. It's a pretty decent aquarium with a nice collection of sea creatures including penguins, dolphins, manatees, and lots of different fish.",
          "We enjoyed seeing the dolphins and lamantines! But it is quite small thus we spent max 2 hours at the site, I couldn\u2019t imagine spending more here.\n\nThe admission is too high at 28\u20ac per person.",
          "Very entertaining",
          "One of the best aquariums I've visited. We spent a good free hours here and there is plenty to see including the spectacular dolphin area",
          "Great for seeing very colourful reef and tropical fish not so good for those large fish and dolphins being held prisoner in those small tank's",
          "Very big and great animals in museum! I liked it there very much! Buy the ticket online!",
          "Very nice aquarium. But super packed and relatively expensive compared to other aquaria.",
          "Great Aquarium. My son loved it.",
          "If you are ever in Genova, make sure you stop by and enjoy all the sea life!",
          "It's a really nice place, a lot of fish to see and enjoy!",
          "It's definitely the place worth to visit if you are in Genova. There are a lot of fishes, sea animals which cared for nicely. Entrance fee about 25-30 eur per person.",
          "Good for kids.\nLittle variety but what they have is done with very good quality.\nAll extra exibitions like butterflies, etc., you can ignore and will miss nothing.",
          "Nice aquarium, big and with plenty of different fishes. Recommended it you are in town",
          "This place is awesome, definitely a must-see and for good reason a target for families with kids and not only... \nBut that's the catch, too many people in a closed, very humid, warm, dark atmosphere... After a while anybody would feel a bit \u2026",
          "London its better. But its nice..(little expansive)",
          "Purchase your tickets online is faster.",
          "One of the best smelling aquariums I've seen.",
          "The place is very spacious and not crowded.  You can watch the dolphins at 12 am in upper floor and 14:15 i think again from the lower floor which allows you to watch their show underwater.  Every place is really special. \nBut, we expected it to be longer trip.\nAlso, we bougth the most beautiful marine themed dools for our oldest son.",
          "This was better than I expected (I grew up visiting the Shedd Aquarium). The aquarium spends a ton of money on maintaining and training dolphins, but you can only watch from a hallway, so most children and adults can't see a thing, this was probably the biggest negative.",
          "Though couldn't enter inside aquarium due to time constraint, but being located at centre of city, everything is easily accessible from this very place, be it shopping, exploring local places or indulging in some quality and delicious local Italian food.",
          "At the beginning I found it a bit expensive but after my visit I think it's totally fair. If you are in Genoa don't miss it.",
          "Such a great place. I've been to a few aquariums and I must say that this aquarium is very diverse. So many different species from all over. So much information on each one and throughout tells you about how fragile the ecosystem really is. \u2026",
          "Impressed that the aquarium was made out of a ship, that still floats.",
          "Was nice and seeing the dolphins were my favorite. Not as big as I thought, but still enough to have fun and see. Little shows also took place inside the aquarium involving the aquarium staff, so that was fun to see as well. \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Best aquarium we have ever visited. Go just to watch the dolphin pool from the lower level",
          "A little bit expensive. Beautiful. Some other thing maybe. It was very disturbing that some 'Afro's' before the entrance, were trying to get money of us with all possible offers and lies. They kept on doing all the time, and it was best \u2026",
          "It is beautiful but extremly crowded. I Think it is overpriced too.  I reccomend avoiding weekends. They should definitely make some limits on how many people go in there at once...",
          "The aquarium is big, lots of aspects of the marine life. Took 2.5 hours with kids. Must see the lower level dolphin aquarium, the seals, the penguins and the tropical aquarium.",
          "This is one of the best Genova attractions.",
          "Wow wow wow so interesting place really worth a visit",
          "It was a great place. It has a little bit of everything: dolphins, penguins, and different kind of fish. It's expensive though.",
          "Excellent Relax Place Highly Recommend",
          "Lovely  place  to with young &older  children  it is  one of the biggest  Aquarium  in Europe",
          "A few amazing places where you can eat, lovely sunsets, and great place to walk around and spend a quiet evening",
          "I would expect to have more informative captions for the different species. The beautiful dolphins (and sharks) didn't have the same captivity conditions resembling the natural environments of the species as the other smaller species did. Overall a good experience.",
          "Great place to visit especially with children, quite educational.. !",
          "This aquarium took a place in my heart, alongside the Monterey Bay Aquarium. The atmosphere in it is amazing: a place with no time, where you can concentrate on fish and sea creatures! My absolute favorite were the manatees, the seals and \u2026",
          "A nice aquarium with a big variety.",
          "Aquarium was good but far too crowded so it's hard to enjoy",
          "It was nice.  Much more than i expected.",
          "Aquarium is small in comparison to others we have seen. But right outside there is a nice pirate ship for kids to visit which was a nice experience.",
          "Fantastic place to spend time with your kids  and family.",
          "Wardrobe was not working, kitchen restaurant was not working, staff unpolite, wi-fi was not working. Expedition itself not bad.",
          "Filled with fish eventhough they look pretty dead. Less varieties. Would be perfect for a todler",
          "Very big, and I saw all those sea species. I really loved dolphins and sea lions",
          "Nice acquarium.",
          "Big octopops wasnt there and we werent informed about it...",
          "WOW! This is a serious aquarium, from the shark tank to the dolphins and everything in between this place is amazing & kept our 3 year old niece very happy. good value for money and great location.",
          "A great place to spend time with your kids, you can spend more then 4 hr's in the complex, the delphine show was great, and many exhibitions worth looking at  the 360 degree lift is nice , nothing more, the biosphere is ok, but the main attraction is the aquarium",
          "The best aquarium I have been to. So good I actually went twice during a trip to Genoa as it was the best attraction in the city. The times for the dolphin shows are unclear, but it's well worth waiting for. I timed it so I could see the \u2026",
          "Very good, this ranks with the British national aquarium in Plymouth, and the Aquarium of Western Australia. Loads to see, very informative, plenty to keep the kids interested.",
          "It's a nice place to visit with the kids. I found it a little bit expensive for the variety it offers. And also the dolphin tank was small for 6 , in my opinion",
          "If you really want to see any animals you have to body check your way to a view. If you are into being trampled to death fantasies though this is the place to go! Also a great place if you enjoy watching people taking awful pictures of animals that had their pictures taken by pros a million times before.",
          "Great place where you can spend the day with kids in case of bad weather. But awfully crowded",
          "The sharks and the dolphins looked quite miserable. Poor things! The tropical part was nicer. Felt sorry for the sea turtle and the penguins. It's a nice concept (part of the aquarium is an old ship), but there's not enough space for the \u2026",
          "Interesting place. A lot of different environments. Probably the infrastructure is not prepared to the quantity of people accepted by day on the peak seasons. Suggest to restrict number of people accepted per day.",
          "the aquarium from Monaco is better + the c\u00f4te d'azure region is fantastic",
          "Awesome plce,very nice to go and learn with family, outside the museum que can go for nice walk,have a glass of wine or enjoy dinner",
          "Very nice\nLiked it\n\nThe Aquarium of Genoa is the largest aquarium in Italy. Located in the old harbor area of Genoa, Italy, the 33,000-square-foot aquarium is a member organization of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria, and welcomes more than 1.2 million visitors each year.",
          "Great aquarium, the largest in Europe. It has big pools with sharks, dolphins, penguins among many other marine animals. It is worth making a reservation and avoid rush hours where it can get really crowded.\n\nCost: Included in the Acquario Village Combo ticket ( Aquarium, Biosfera,  Maritime museum; 57 Euro)",
          "Nice aquarium and we could leave our suitcases in the cloakroom which was great!",
          "Nice place but annoying additional charges for cloakroom (2eur per piece) and other attractions",
          "Did you ever see Dolphins out in the wild? If so, don't waste your money to see 5 dolphins in a very tiny aquarium!\nSame with the penguin and seal...",
          "Great experience, takes about 2 hours to go trough it.",
          "Very nice and cool great time for family time",
          "Perhaps the high point of my visit to Genoa. It is a very nice place with a variety of sea creatures and even other animals. I like the fact that they have a fast food area on site as walking around the facility may be a little tasking.",
          "A large aquarium with lots to see. It's good that the signs are both in Italian and English. Helpful staff and tidy overall. A bit on the expensive side (28\u20ac) but then again lots to see and experience. Biggest drawback that hasn't to do \u2026",
          "Not as packed with different species as the one in Copenhagen, but there's still enough to see for several hours, and they created perfect atmosphere with ambient music and lights.\nAlso, you don't see lamantinos in every aquarium, and the \u2026",
          "Big nice aquarium with few free shows during a day.",
          "Best place in the city. Loved all the different types of fishes displayed.",
          "A great way to spend 2 hours enjoying the nature!",
          "That's awesome lovely Amazing place, love it \u2764\ufe0f",
          "This would be a great aquarium if it didn't have the manatees & dolphins caged in. I went because my wife really wanted to and I'm not too proud to admit I balled my eyes out when I saw the beautiful manatees in such a small space. And I \u2026",
          "What a fantastic education place. PLEASE LET THE BIG FISH AND MAMMALS FREE. ITS CRUEL AND NOT NECESSARY. THE AQUARIUM WOULD BE A HAPPIER KINDER PLACE. PLEASE LET THEM GO HOME.",
          "Super beautiful and amazing! With a lot of fishes and beautiful things to see. The ticket is a little bit expensive but it worth seekng inside this place. I think it takes around 2 hours to see everything . I went there with my family and definitely it was good",
          "Extremely beautiful and interesting",
          "An Amazing place to visit in Genova\nA bit sad though, that the animals aren\u2019t living in their original home",
          "Great fun for the whole family. A bit expensive for 5 people. A lot to see. We spent there 4 hours.",
          "Fantastic place to visit in your leisure time to feel the marine environment.",
          "Is it the biggest or the dirtiest? We went there in 15.07.2019 and the toilets are not usable. Even no soap. Actually you can't get your service after you pay 28\u20ac for the entrance. \n\nThey are proud with the \"biggest thing\" but probably it \u2026",
          "Good entertainment and good value for money",
          "Still one of the most beautiful acquaria in Europe for an affordable price",
          "Very wide variety of marine life. One of the best aquariums I've been to. Needs more air conditioning though.",
          "Magnificent place. You can spend 3 hours of enjoying there.",
          "Wonderful and extensive exhibits, kid-friendly, stroller-friendly, well organized and clean.",
          "Very beautiful place.  Strongly recommend.",
          "Very good place to visit and it is the largest aquarium in Europe",
          "Excellent place to while away a couple of hours",
          "Great place. Really big. Room for push chairs. Dolphin show is amazing. All info in English too and maps available in loads of other languages.",
          "There aren't that many animals in there but its beautiful and fun",
          "Very cool but FREE THE DOLPHINS!!",
          "Great place to visit with kids. My son likes sharks so much, so he was happy as my daughter who liked more tropical fishes and tactile pool. Had to wait in the line to enter though as there's a  photo service at entrance, and the wardrobe... Really huge place, the show with dolphins is amazing!",
          "Nice,but crowded and it is a bit complicated to find an alternative way to another floor if you want to skip a part.",
          "What you will discover is that the most impressive species to be studied is homo sapiens taking selfies on Saturdays. Not much to see, made me sad to see the dolphins being given so little space, even if it is large by international standards. The best room was the jellyfish.",
          "Great on the rainy day we had, went at lunch time and wasn't too busy, it looked busier as we were leaving a couple of hours later. Definitely wait for the shark feeding and dolphin show.",
          "Nice event for big and smal! Additional costs for several attractions inside...thats why just 4 stars",
          "There is student discount if you buy the tickets at the counter! \u20ac18 for students and about \u20ac26 for adults",
          "Good place for visiting but for me not too much of corals.",
          "Interesting place with much different aquariums. Very nice and funny sealion... my lovely animale",
          "Nice to see a large variety of sea life under one roof",
          "Very interesting and alot of species to see",
          "Best and biggest aquarium in Europe....loved the experience...worth the visit",
          "A wonderful experience for a family trip or couples or anyone with an interest in marine life. The place is organized in a way that you can't miss anything, absolutely worth seeing while in Genova",
          "so sad i didnt get the time to experience this magical wonder!",
          "Very large aquarium, lots of variety.  However, I did feel the tanks were rather empty of any plant life or habitiat for the fish.... Especially the dolphins!\n\nDolphins in an aquarium seems one step too far.",
          "Impressive in size and featuring plenty of species, it is a nice experience, especially for children. A bit overpriced for the experience but on a sunny day you can enjoy the sun on its deck.",
          "I was pleasantly pleased to have found this gem visiting the city. There was an old ship docked nearby, which was a marvel in itself, and a number of places to visit nearby. The aquarium was set up well and the tanks looked quite healthy \u2026",
          "These animals should be free. I feel so sorry for the dolphins which are in a small tank with nothing to do. May all beings be happy and free.",
          "Magnificent chiesa\nYou will love to visit Genova",
          "Fantastic experience, great value for money. The variety of species was incredible",
          "The biggest aquarium in Europe, a must see if you have kids or if you are just around!",
          "Loads of water life. Highly recommended after peak times so you can take your time to admire them .",
          "A very pleasant experience throughout! After the first two rooms, one presentation and one large cylindric aquarium, you enter the \"real\" aquarium.\n\nHere you get up close and personal with Manatees, Seals, Sharks, Jellyfish and everything \u2026",
          "It was really nice aquarium! Recommend",
          "Fantastic! So many different species! The dolphins pool is huge",
          "One word to describe this place, \"crowded\".  Regardless of increments set, you still have to fight through the crowds of people.  Alot of empty space that could be utilized but it isn't; not so much for an Aquarium that is said to be the biggest in Europe.  Perhaps in space it is.",
          "Great p\u0142ace for whole family :) You have to visit :)",
          "Is one's of the best place in the city \nGood for everyone",
          "Popular place for Tourist. Thr prices was very expensive for me so i didn't get inside.",
          "Really cool, the wiew on the fishes was beautiful. We enyojed it really much.",
          "Nice Aquarium. Entrance cost for adult arround 30.- Euro. Depends which day.\nIn the Aquarium you going throug a circle.",
          "A fun place to visit with your family. We really enjoyed the touch tank.",
          "Very nice. Good reason to visit it with kids.",
          "We spent a wonderful time here with my son. Fish, sharks, dolphins and penguins and many many other awsome things.... Marvellous",
          "Best in europe but expensive. Worth a visit",
          "A fantastic, top notch aquarium. They say it's the largest in Europe but you can see everything in an afternoon. While I encourage you to support the aquarium by buying souvenirs and food, eat somewhere else if you have a list of restaurants you want to eat at. The only reason to eat at the aquarium is for the view.",
          "As usual the experience is top, however no 5 star due to too high ticket price\nThis year we got that bad surprise, now prices are variable following the season, high season high price, ending up to spend almost the double we used to in the past\nThen please avoid the high season... if you can",
          "I am so happy I visited this aquarium because they have so many varieties of fish that I have not seen before... I believe it is the largest aquarium in Europe",
          "Beautiful. Big variety of fish. The only problem is that you cant find the exit quickly",
          "Not worth it\n\nWe stopped here by chance and that was our luck! This family runned restaurant (third generation within those walls) his a fantastic spot to taste typical food from Genova and enjoy a not to touristic location.\nWe had some \u2026",
          "Poor mammals and any animals should be free not in captivity.\nI left in tears from there...",
          "Not bad. Thats all. There are nice aquariums but not as much as I expected for such price (28 eur per person). Mallorca aquarium is much better in my opinion.",
          "Very well done. I would recommend. Lots of exhibits.",
          "Nice place. Not extra big. But if you like sea creatures you can spend a lot of time. Kids were happy to run with delphines and \"play\" with tropic fishes.\nWill visit next time for sure",
          "Little pricey ticket, but definitely worth to visit. Dolphins are magical.",
          "A nice aquarium-  with 2 larger sharks and dolphins.",
          "We loved this place! There is a great range of animals to see and its very educational. I love the fact that they put everything in English too.",
          "Pretty good aquarium, with an excellent opportunity to view dolphins. On the other hand, it's claim to be 'the biggest in Europe' must be based mainly on the amount of empty floor space, not the number of tanks or fish. It's pricey, and the \u2026",
          "If you visit Genova this is a must, so amazing",
          "It was WOW and AMAZING, more than i expected",
          "Very interesting place. Amazing fishes, possibility to touch them.",
          "they let you pet stingrays. Great place for a day with family.",
          "Crowded even on days that are supposed to be relatively empty when it's tourist season. Advised to come off season if possible. Exhibits are mediocre, but the place is quite big.",
          "You must take your children and go there \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c",
          "A great place to visit! You can see all sorts of different fish and mostly the fish seem happy and well taken care of. In addition the establishment seems to care about the nature, because at the end of the museum they make you aware of \u2026",
          "It is on of europes biggest aquarium im Genua. The animals they have are just incredible. You can see sharks and all kind of fishes and under water living marmals.\n\nThe dolphin show  was awesome.\nThe dolphin really seems to like thair trainer how did a stunning show with. \n\n*****5 big fatttttttttttttt stars!!!!!!!*****",
          "Awesome aquarium! I thought price was little high at first but worth every euro. So awesome. Must check out. Especially on a hot day to get out of the sun and enjoy a great time. Can watch the dolphins for HOURS! So well trained.",
          "A great experience, up close and personal with such amazing creatures, loved it",
          "Expensive, outdated, takes too long to get tickets.\nThis place promisses more than it delivers. Comparing with other aquariums we have been to this is on the bottom of the list. When you arrive you are immediately surrounded by 4-5 \u2026",
          "Beautiful place of awe",
          "It was something to do while the cruise ship was in port. Very crowded though and seeing dolphins in such small tanks was upsetting. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d return as I prefer to see them in the wild.",
          "Amazing Aquarium, well located. Perfect if you're visiting the city.",
          "Our kids had a great time exploring the aquarium. Most displays showed in English. The dolphin show was fantastic. It was all in Italian, but the kids still enjoyed the show.",
          "Aquarium was beautiful, a lot of thing to see but food service is terrible.",
          "Good place",
          "There is much to do, when we visited we were there for 2 hours. There is a restaurant and petting pool, so many animals, it is not just fish they have dolfins and penguins to snakes and frogs. I definitely recommend that you try this aquarium.",
          "It was beautiful to see the sharks being fed and the dolphins performing",
          "Fantastic aquarium. Reserve 3-4 hours for it",
          "We all loved it,  especially the manatees!",
          "I love this place!! It is a must to visit in Genova.",
          "Great location for children and for adults too!\nUsualy spent about 3 hours!",
          "Compared to other more modern ones in Europe, falls behind... Value for money is poor",
          "I really loved the variety of different sea animals one was able to see here, especially the dolphins were a big highlight! Still I found the tank for the dolphins too small. I'm sure they would love an extra swimming area   outside of the aquarium for example!",
          "Most incredible aquarium I have ever seen.",
          "A really nice facility with many ceiling to floor aquarium views. My favorites spaces were there seal and the dolphin enclosure. The penguin display is a little underwhelming but everything else was pretty good. The restrooms were \u2026",
          "Great aquarium with lots to see. Almost all information in English as well as Italian.",
          "Excelent for a visit with children.",
          "Awesome animals! Easy to navigate, well presented. I'm not sure who loved it more, me or my two year old niece!",
          "Nice aquarium. Just didn't like that you had to stay in one direction couldn't meander and go backwards through the place",
          "The big aquarium from Western Europe ! I recommend for all types of people's ! \u2764\u2764\u2764",
          "Very crowded. Long queues to buy a ticket and to enter. Though the aquarium is great!",
          "Very nice place beautiful and clean... however the restaurant was very slow and no space to eat...",
          "Visually beautiful.",
          "It's okay. Though I expected more and not all the fishes are real and there are fewer fishes than expected...",
          "This is a nice place to spend time with the family, although there\u2019s no much information about the animals, they look healthy and beautiful",
          "A wonderful and huge place with several amazing attractions, I specially like the shark and dolphin show rooms in which you can see through a curved glass that makes an amazing experience.\nThe place is specially suitable for kids and \u2026",
          "Wonderful day out for children of all ages",
          "Huge huge huge.......worth every penny spend",
          "It was a great experience!",
          "Wonderful experience. I was even more excited than my 4 y-o. The acquario is huge and with so many different sea species. Species that you only see on TV. If u go to Genova, that s a must-see!",
          "I find this is all for the people and not for the animals. For example, the dolphins had to do tricks and had only a concrete pool, with no plants to swim in. There were also no toys for them to play with to stimulate their minds. Being as intelligent creatures as they are, I found that heartbreaking.",
          "Very exciting place, suitable for families",
          "I was disgusted to see that they had dolphins in captivity. Why would anyone think it is acceptable to keep large cetaceans in captivity?",
          "The best one ever! All sea life, fauna and flora! Dolphin show, lots of different sharks, Red sea life and more!",
          "The biggest aquarium of Mediterranean sea!",
          "The best aquarium I've ever been to.  Well worth a visit",
          "Great find, will definitely be back!",
          "Good enough. Beautiful dolphins and lamantines...but i wish that dolphins get free...",
          "Truly a huge aquarium with lots of varieties. It is a walking distance from the main port of Genoa. It is a host for a large maritime life as well as some land dwelling animals (Boa, huge turtles..) You can expect to see many endangered \u2026",
          "Aquarium is big but I expected more from the Europe's best aquarium.",
          "Initially the aquarium seemed pretty nice and to have a decent variety. \nUnfortunately the building itself was very smelly and although this can be forgiven due to the extremely hot weather, what is absolutely unacceptable is finding a dead \u2026",
          "Nice ....great",
          "Almost the sea wonders in one place. Great place for children and adults",
          "Boring and expensive for a family !!!! Staff have not bought in to customer service ethos at all.....",
          "Awesome! Really a place to visit",
          "Best aquarium in Europe.",
          "Massive place, really good to visit. Allow about 2+ hrs to see it all.",
          "Lots to sea and with good air conditioning",
          "A large aquarium with lots of marine life to see, but layout and explanatory panels are a bit old fashioned.",
          "Nice place to visit early on the morning. Avoid holidays day as its really busy. A bit expensive for what you actually get to see. The temperature around is really hot so make short you visit it with light garments. ;)",
          "Aquarium of genoa is the best place to visit because there we can see many kinds of sea fishes. We can see sharks and dolphin and penguin and so many other fishes.",
          "A fantastic Aquarium and for what you get, fairly reasonably priced. Unfortunately it was simply too busy. People were taking no notice of signs about flash photography. With the amount of money that they will be raking in, you need more staff about to make sure people are following rules.",
          "I think the price I way too much and the aquarium was not up to date, som of the fish did not have a good life, and ormost impossible to find parking, and beware of theifs in the front of the aquarium.",
          "Amazing! \nBest place ever to see the under sea life how is it?!! \nAlso I shot 2 photo from the PANORAMIC ELEVATOR it so nice if u wanna see the hole city \u2764\u2764\n\nGENOVA is not a normal city!\nIt's so kind! \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude0d",
          "Very impressive aquarium. I wish dolphins had a bigger room to swim.",
          "Wow, just wow. One of the largest aquqriums in Europe, you are going to enjoy each and every moment. If you are living and Genoa, and have kids then buhing an annual pass would be a good idea. I just fell in love with dolphins. \u263a\ufe0f",
          "It's amazing place in Genoa next to the city center.",
          "Nice but expensive ticket price... If I hadn't see the dolphin show (which happens twice per day) I would say it doesn't worth the cost.",
          "Love to go with kids and loved ones",
          "Lovely! Its a true maze but there's sooo much to see!",
          "Simply amazing\nOne of the best aquarium in the world in my opinion.\nThe dolphin pool is the best one and the show that the make is wonderful\nPerfect choice for a day out with friend or family\n\nFollow my adventures and review on instagram\nNicholasamenta93",

          "Marvellous day out",
          "Wonderful place, kids love's.",
          "The Aquarium is a great experience. Though they have some smaller sections you pay extra to see once inside. Almost everything is translated to English. But videos in displays and projections are only in Italian",
          "Very nice for adults and kids",
          "It is so beautiful!! I've been twice and the first time I was in awe. I love the ocean and marine life it was an amazing experience.  The second time the aquarium had added new things and it was like seeing it for the first time all over again. Strongly recommended it is breathtaking!",
          "Great place to spend a rainy afternoon with your kids.",
          "Greatest aquarium in Europe",
          "Very nice aquarium, kids especially loved the dolphins and jellyfish. Highly recommended.\n\nSome negative remarks:\na) ticket pdf + email says you MUST print it, whereas FAQ says it's ok to display on phone. Indeed we showed it on my phone \u2026",
          "Great food top floor..",
          "Magical. It's quite big, so make sure to invest a couple of hours. Moreover, make sure that you finish your visit an hour before closing time, because they push you to leave (with their way) 45 mins before closing time. Lagoon of mermaids is the highlight for a person that has visited several aquariums across the globe.",
          "Ugly building on the outside, but very beautiful on the inside... A lot to see, very interactive also for the kids. Food from the burger place inside was good, but expensive. Definitely something you want to go to with small children! Preferably those younger than 4 years old since they have free entrance",
          "Very nice aquarium. It seems to have almost all the creatures of sea. The Dolphin show is great and must. Although it is quite expensive, it is worth visiting especially along with kids. The surrounding is also very nice and lots of options around for foods.",
          "Great aquarium! Lot of beautiful animals. Penguins and dolphins are friendly.",
          "Great aquarium right on the port! Lots to see and learn.",

          "2 hours experience of aquatic Life",

          "Absolutely loved it",
          "Lovely and unique collections of marine life. Very friendly staff",
          "Nice place to visit in Genoa. A lot to see and the habitats were pretty big and well maintained. Maybe a bit overpriced but we had a great time watching all the lovely species from the ocean.",
          "Very nice place; the best thing, by far, are the dolphins.",
          "Interesting place. Modern and loving",
          "This aquarium is incredible! All of the animals seem to be well cared for without any noticeable decrease in attraction for visitors. The semi-immersive tanks are an ingenious design to make you feel that much more immersed in the ocean \u2026",
          "Nice place to visit. But some aquariums can be and cleaner :)",
          "Wonderful experience. Exceptional collection, including dolphins, penguins and seals, beautifully presented.",
          "One of the best in the world",
          "Amazing aquarium. My 1 year old daughter loved it. Honestly this aquarium greatly exceeded my expectations. Definitely worth a visit if you're in Genoa.",
          "Excellent place. The best and the biggest aquarium in Europe. However, little costly for non-european tourists.",
          "i viewed pictures but unfortunetly it was late to access it but i think it's very interesting to visit Bellissimo",
          "Nice place with lots of aquariums and things to see. A surprise was the \"you can touch pool\" where you have the posibility to touch a few stingrays. Really really cool.",
          "Great place to take children.",
          "Was more than expected. Beautiful, big and interesting. A bit pricey but worth it as they seem to take very good care of the animals.",
          "Would be 5 stars if it wasn't so busy.",
          "A M A ZI N G",
          "This was a very emotional place for me! Loved it!!!",
          "Cool",
          "Even if you\u2019re not a kid anymore this place is awesome. There are a lot of various species, watching dolphins swimming was incredible. Entrance fee is a little bit expensive but it totally does worth it.",
          "Best aquarium in Europe. Lots of different and beautiful animals. Definetely a stop to do in Genova.",
          "Didn't even go there!",
          "Very nice display of water fauna. Best if you buy the tickets online and at least a few days before so you get a good time interval.",
          "Wonderful. Kids Will Love it",
          "Spacious aquarium! Has almost all kinds of fish! Lovely dolphin show. I recommend it. We went to Genova especially to visit the aquarium",
          "It's very nice place to visit. Not only for kids but also for adults. TICKET BOUGHT ON INTERNET IS CHEAPER. It takes only 5 minutes to buy it. You can take photos and videos without flash. Seeing so many different creatures is just \u2026",
          "Great place for the family. We visited from America. The dolphins are especially fun to see.",
          "Is beautiful",
          "It is an above average aquarium with good verity of species. However, I find it a little bit expensive at 28 Euro ticket for adults on weekends.",
          "Nice. Will visit again",
          "Good place to bring family on weekend here",
          "Big and nice aquarium. However, despite that it occupies big area, it doesn't present too much varieties of sea inhabitants.",
          "Not my favorite aquarium. Laid out like a labyrinth in a ship, I had a feeling of being herded through IKEA. Rather small pools, but an interesting collection of creatures. The kids loved it, and that\u2019s the most important thing.",
          "One of the most biggest aquarium that we have visited. English language not present all over the places. Take cca 4 hours to visit it. Been very impressed by dolphin show inside - a show where the trainer was in front of the glass wall \u2026",
          "Amazing! It's a must see",
          "Dolphin sink and the big varieties of sea creatures.",
          "Beautiful animal displays and lots of interaction with them as well. The food is good as well.",
          "Quite crowdy, better to book in advance.",
          "We chose a hotel very near the Acquarium with views of boats from the balcony.\nVery child friendly, though not cheap. \nA good nights sleep is important.\nIt was a lovely weekend for us all.",
          "Lots of fish if you like fish",
          "Nice variety of sea creatures and fish.\nThe most interesting part is seeing the seals swimming very fast inside their tank.",
          "Definitely not the largest aquarium in Europe",
          "Excellent place to visit with family. Lots of fish to see and read about. Show with dolphins takes place at 12 and 16. Several gift shops. And cafe with snacks and fast food.",
          "Very nice. Kids loved it. Dolphins show was great. They could have taken better care of non itallian speaking turists.",
          "Very nice place, good to spent some time with kids.",
          "Best place in Genova",
          "Magical place! Best experience in Genoa. Well kept Aquarium easy to navigate and trippy. Entrance fee is 26 eur per adult. Highly recommended!",
          "Large and interesting aquarium. Sad that dolphins had too small pool. Separately was birds room with a fee, it was extraordinary, birds flew around in the room. It was good, that they had information for every risk of extinction and information for each species as well.",
          "Nice big place. Quite a lot to see and do in Genova aswell, just don't gave back roads!!",
          "A fun afternoon, especially if u have kids.",
          "If you go to Genoa it's a must see. That said the prices are rocket high and it can get very crowded. I saw lots of people with infants but I'd recommend it only if you have kids over 3. Older kids can definitely get the most out of it.",
          "Worth visiting place with kids",
          "Good sight for visitors. Has a varity of sea world to view",
          "Boring",
          "It is the bigest aquarium in Europe. I strongly suggest to visit.",
          "Would not go back to gernoa",
          "I like this pleace...a lot of fish..and dolfins",
          "The kids loved this aquarium. It's huge. You could easily spend half a day here. Very modern facilities and so much to see and learn. Definitely recommend visiting. ",
          "I enjoyed the Aquarium but it felt a bit crowded and noisy for my taste. Also, though some of the tanks are very big, you can still see their ends and walls, so it does not leave you with the impression of being \"immersed\" in the underworld.",
          "Brilliant place. Kept my boy entertained for hours and the Dolphin viewing hall is superb.",
          "Quite interesting to explore with children. Lots of fishes and other sea creatures. Easy to navigate and stroller friendly.",
          "The aquarium itself is very good...can easily spend half a day here at a relaxed pace....a lot more marine life than I thought. ..the outside part maybe not that nice as it's a port city so very busy and filthy....Old Genoa town much nicer and only 15 minutes walk from here.",
          "Lovely sight.... Fun of it all was the formation performance by the dolphins",
          "Nice aquarium very interesting very big",
          "Lots of cool water animals. The under watersurface dolphin show was good but we somehow missed that whole section at first.",
          "Not worth paying 26\u20ac",
          "Very nice port.",
          "It was a great experience. We spent there 2h30 but it is a place where you can spend your whole day both adults and children. There are thematic aquariums by zones, fishes, or a cartoon (sponge bob). It is easily accessible from the traim \u2026",
          "Absolutely too expensive. 88 Eur for a family of 4 people.\nAdditionally you need to pay the parking.\nIt has nothing really sensational to offer, if you have seen other aquariums then you can skip this one.",

          "This is definitely the best aquarium I've seen. The one in Barcelona (claimed to be the biggest in Europe) is much less interesting. An advice to make your visit amazing: check the times when they make dolphin shows (at the upper floor): it \u2026",
          "The best",
          "Really big aquarium, though I doubt it\u2019s \u201cthe biggest in Europe\u201d as they advertise it. They have dolphins and penguins there.",

          "Very good location !",
          "It's a bit expensive but the exibits there are fun especially the seals and dolphin exhibits. For the moat part it's air conditioned, which is nice for a break from the summer heat. If your into sea life check it out if not don't feel too much like you are missing out.",
          "Very beautiful and vast. Must spend 2 hours minimum.",
          "If u are at Genoa.. then this is one of the place where you can spend your time.. aquarium is at very reasonable and pretty nice experience...",

Don't forget to see the biodome and the butterflies. Keep in mind that some exhibits require an extra (small) fee/donation to enter. ",

          "It's been a while since I've visited an aquarium and the aquarium of Genova did not disappoint! They also had a small section for animals from Madagascar. They were quite informative. It's about \u20ac26/adult but I'd say it's worth it if you're into marine life!",
          "Wonderful place, a must see in Genoa. There are lots of fish, dolphins, lots of sea life. There is a special hall where one can touch a a fish!",
          "The kids loved it. It was incredible hot inside though, and the space for the animals is bit too small...",
          "Longest queues ever, too crowded we didn\u2019t have the energy or time to wait so long, unfortunately they had one line open, probably because inside it was full- there needs to be better organization to this, but it was nice to wander outside with little gift shops and food stands",
          "Very good.",
          "This is the 6 time I visited this aquarium in my life, and the 2 nd in the last 3 years. Always leave me enchanted. Excellent place to visit for adults and children. The pool where you can touch the fish is my favourite.",
          "Too many screaming children. Difficulty seeing displays",
          "Huge aquarium. Wide diversity of fish, also had lizzards and snakes which my son liked. Spent at least 2 and a half hours there.",

          "Didn't bother taking photos, as we all know what fish look like... We went as it was a treat from my aunt for my kids, which they enjoyed the few hours walking about and looking. \n\nBut.... Where were the squid? Octopus? Its a shame they \u2026",
          "A must go place for everyone who is interested in animals, particularly marine life. If you do visit, don't miss the dolphin show at around 2 pm, fantastic! Good for kids and families. Tickets are rather pricey with family options - 2 \u2026",

          "An incredible expirience, it usually lasts between 2 and 3 hours to go trough the whole aquarium. A ticket is \u20ac26, you can obtain a \u20ac8 discount if you are a student. A place you definitely must go if you visit Genova.",
          "Very nice aquarium it\u2019s a must to see in Genoa my 2 years old love it",
          "Extremely crowded even in January. There is no point to book a slot in advance, nobody cares. In addition: nothing special. My kids enjoyed the aquarium in Brighton and in London much more.",
          "Great place. Impressive animals. My son of 6 years old stays here for 4 hours. \nOnly 2 points are not good: Price, and the restaurant inside.",
          "Extremly interesting.",
          "Nice fishes!!",

          "Fish in plane tanks don't intrest me anymore",
          "The size is not so big, but I could enjoy it. Fish making is suitable for children.",
          "An absolutely great way to spend a day with kids. Interesting exhibits, dolphins that can play ball sports, a new manatee pup, parking right outside the door, a building designed by Renzo Piano, what's not to like?",
          "I read online that this was a very nice aquarium and I had a rainy day so I went. It was terrible. The tanks that the fish had were soo small. Especially for an animal like a shark or dolphin, they need lots of room to constantly swim. \u2026",
          "Very beautiful",
          "Short version: it's worth the money.\n\nLong version: it's bigger than it looks: several environments are reproduced in temperature, humidity and pH.\nI *strongly* recommend to buy the visit \"Behind-the-scenes\": it's worth every single penny \u2026",
          "Very exciting place even for adults, but especially for children. Calms you down. Must visit at least once in the life!",

          "Great place to spend some hours. Sharks, dolphins, medusas and all kinds of sea animals. It's a great experience for both children and adults. If you stay for at least a day in Genoa, it's definitely woth to visit, though it's quite expensive, but a memorable experience.",
          "Great place value for money.",

          "I was honestly expecting more out of this aquarium for being supposedly one of the best in Europe. It had some nice exhibits, but seemed short for a tour and employees were shutting down sections behind us as we walked through, even though \u2026",
          "A wonderful experience. Completely worth the price.",
          "It's a big aquarium and what I liked the most were the lamantines (never saw them before at an aquarium), a touch pool with fish and a very big pool with dolphins wich you can watch from above and below water.",
          "Nice place to visit and spend sometime. Kids will definitely enjoy the place with large and small fishes. They have maintained it well with sharks, dolphins, penguins and many other species. Crowded on weekends so be prepared. Lots of places to eat nearby. De Ferrari is at the walking distance.",
          "It was  a very nice place to visit. Just that at the time where I was there, there were too many people.",

          "A great behind the scenes experience where we learnt so much about jellyfish and bottlenose dolphins and what the Genoese families enjoy doing on a Sunday. The place was packed and it's like a Tardis - hard to escape from. I expect it's less crowded on a week day. Altogether though, an experience I thoroughly enjoyed.",
          "Bellisimo",
          "Although not the best we've seen, but we'll worth the visit. Has some unique animals You won't find in one place (penguins, sharks, sea cows and seals). One obvious down point - very pricy.",

          "Although I found it expensive, it is a nice way to pass a few hours. There is a lot to see and some interactive areas too. We stopped halfway through for a drink on the terrace which was lovely as it wasn't too hot on the day we visited but not much shade available if the sun",
          "I can't say we have seen a lot of acquariums around the world, but we (a touring senior couple) found this one pretty impressive. The walk-around displays were quite awesome and the tropical lagoon captivated me--I could have spent hours just watching the colourful fish swim",
          "We were there with my husband last month, and doesn't regret about it) However the tickets were expensive - \u20ac28 per person only to aquarium - it was worth it! There are a lot of sea creatures, as sea cows (they are so cool, big and joyful), sharks, jellyfishes, dolphins,",
          "Great aquarium. We booked a behind the scenes tour for 10 of us 10-70 years old. The aquarium staff were flat out fantastic to help book our adventure. Valentina, our guide, was amazing! Her english is excellent and she kept everyone engaged. She is just wonderful. We laugh, we",
          "Dont go in the summer. Very hot! I hope in other periods its more clean. The glasses were dearty snd how can you see the fish like that?? The cafeteria area was embarassing. Dirth all over. How ever the kids enjoy. They enjoy everywhere",
          "Advertised as biggest aquarium in Europe. I was so dissappointed because I saw much nicer and more organized aquariums elsewhere in Europe. In short, this place is not worth the time and money you spend for it.",
          "It is well expensive , but I don\u2019t recommend if you\u2019re couple .it is a perfect place if you have a family with kids that will enjoy more. For me it was a little bit boring",
          "I been there with my family on vacation and as I been with my little brother and cousin we decided to go there so they can enjoyed the experience. Is a really good place to know the different kind of Fauna located in the mediterranean sea and other part of the world. But for",
          "A good experience, the kids where extremly happy with the visit. A lot of stairs so not very easy accessible with a stroller (there are lifts but not always located near the stairs). Maybe a bit expensive, we took the Acqua Village package, but was a good treat on a rainy day.",
          "Very good aquarium, just watch out for the pickpockets offering \u201cfree\u201d bracelets outside. Don\u2019t let them put it on your arm, as they ask for a fee, then if you don\u2019t want the bracelet, they take it back and try and have your watch at the same time!!",
          "Amazing experience, interactive and well set up! Staff is very well prepared and kind. My 6 year old fully enjoyed! We strongly recommend the dolfin experience!",
          "This is a big aquarium with a lot of great tanks with fish and corals. They also have a few dolphins and yeah, I'm on the fence. Some of them are very old and deserve to live out their lives in peace, but the aquarium could do a better job at explaining how exactly their pod",
          "Fabulous aquarium and wonderfully interactive. Deserves the accolades it receives although it's not cheap. Especially if you go with a family. Still thought it worth the price of the ticket and enjoyed it very much.",
          "The best aquarium I\u2019ve ever been to. Such an amazing array of marine life on show. We spent around 2hours here and loved every minute. It mightn\u2019t be cheap but so worth it. My partner even said it was better than Seaworld. Recommended 100% whilst in Genoa.",
          "Very very lovely experience at the aquarium de Genova! .. seeing all the different types of animals that are there & the dolphins swimming over your head is amazing! Lovely lovely food also inside the restaurant that is inside there! Worth every euro & definitely worth",
          "Very interesting, but the queues at the entrance maybe long and it is a bit overcrowded. Visiting it in detail will take close to three hours",
          "We stumbled into the aquarium on a very warm July afternoon. It was great. Cool atmosphere and about 2 hrs of time to relax and check out fish. I\u2019ve been to a handful of aquariums including the Monterrey California aquarium and this one is very good. Check it out.",
          "Located in the hearth of Old Harbour is an amazing experience for adults and Young\u2019s that\u2019s worth\u2019s visit Genoa just for this. Is one of the most important Aquarium in the world connected with university and synergistically exchange worldwide with other important similar",
          "26\u20ac per adult. Even concessions were only a couple or so euros less. There are very few such attractions in Genoa, so it may be that travellers are paying for the lack of competition.. Have been to far better aquariums for less money ..",
          "Right next to the Cruise Port a wonderful collection of marine life. Bit rowdy, so buy skip the line tickets and keep extra time. Extensive collection of marine life specially the Jelly fish, Seal, Penguins, Swordfish, Sea Horses, Eel, etc. Follow it up with Biosphere, where the",
          "While the lines are long, the wait is very quick so don\u2019t be deceived. The location offers a variety of activities for adults and children, interactive, educational and extremely interactive. Food options available, multiple floors with elevator options",
          "Considering the tickets cost, it is expected to have possibility to breath inside...poor air conditioning, especially when many visitors. Moscow aquarium much better.",
          "Fantastic visit..it may look a bit pricey, but the reward of so many fabulous displays soon override the cost. All the fish and animals are presented in a beautiful setting. Absolute must on any visit to Genoa",
          "I recommend getting to the aquarium early, we were there just after 9am and there were no queues but by the time we came out about 3 hours later there were large queues to get in. The aquarium is big and the dolphin enclosure especially the underwater part was great, plenty to",
          "Was lots to see including the dolphin. Would get there first thing 8:30 as the queues are very long later on.",
          "Very small aquarium. We have been to several other in Europe: Lisbon, Bristol, Wroclaw and this one is so far the most outdated. Animals are very cramped, especially the penguins. Dolphin show nothing spectacular. You were asked to pay money for watching a movie, getting",
          "Great family fun and I would suggest to visit the aquarium when in Genoa. It is also located conviniently at the dock to visit also other plces. Also reasonably priced. Good price/performance ratio.",
          "Came to the aquarium as part of a TUI excursion so because the entrance fee was included in the cost we didn't have to queue and we got straight inside without the hassle. We are so glad we booked this trip as it is an amazing place to see. All of the aquariums were huge so all",
          "We decided to take the plunge despite the high price as it seemed like a good place to visit, it was a cold windy day and an indoor experience seemed like a good idea. The whole place is very well laid out and the tour takes you in a nice logical order through all the",
          "Great place to Be on a rainy day. Expensive to het in but worth every bit of it. Huge aquariums of all over tue would. Very relaxing wathing the dolphins with a Cup of Coffee from the Shop right next to it.",
          "The first time we tried to go to the Aquarium we spent 3 hours trying to get a parking space and then gave up - use public transport as there are far to few parking spaces around the aquarium. On our second attempt, arriving by train, we had to wait two hours for a time slot to",
          "Cannot be missed if in the area! Well maintained, clean and spacious. Loved the dolphins and the tactile pool...",
          "There were just too many people in there to be able to enjoy the visit. Go early, or late maybe?? We were a bit sad about the manatees.",
          "Having read reviews and visiting with a 6 year old, we we're really looking forward to this experience, Unfortunately, we we're left disappointed. We prepaid \u20ac95 online for a 2.30pm visit to try and avoid the queues, as turning up at 10.30am was chaotic. It didn't work as We",
          "they mantain good but I'm not happy for them . it's not good put them in a cage . I'm so sorry for them .",

          "I went with my daughter (13) and I was expecting a pleasant and knowledgeable experience; instead we were pushed throughout the crowded place, unable to see, read and enjoy the animals. Moreover, several of the experiences inside come for an extra a few euros, adding up costs to",
          "It was quite disappointing, specially after the one in Madrid. I don't think it is worth the money even because inside there are more activities. The spaces are small for the fish and every room we went in was FULL of people!",
          "This a lovely place to visit during a trip to Genova, I spent my first evening in Genova here and was amazed watching the sea life and animals and seeing all the different species in the Aquarium. The exhibitions are organised very well with a lot to see and plenty of",
          "First of all we expected more for 30\u20ac. It\u2019s written visit takes 2,30h, took us only 1hour actually. Except dolphins there was nothing exciting. Definitily overcrowded and my daughter couldn\u2019t walk alone as older kids constantly push her. Also description of animals are placed",
          "Nice place to visit. Just to comments: eating there is a bit of a problem (if you do not go out) and some shows would add a lot of interest to the visit.",
          "My 8 year old and I visited for the second time on a rainy Sunday afternoon and it was as good as ever and open later than expected. Such a huge range of fish and animals including manatees, dolphins and sharks - my 8 year old like the octopus best and the jellyfish are amazing.",
          "Got to agenoa on Apr Sat morning. Probably wouldn't be here if we didn't have a crouse. Just out of the port there is a tourist info. Got a city map and 4 coupons. 10 min walk and we got to the aquarium. Almost no line. Inside stupid line for taking photo for god knows how much",
          "Huge collection from all other the world. Fascinating - you need at least 2 hours just to go through the whole building and if you want to stop and enjoy it more, plan more time! We were 2 adults (no kids) and though that the experience was spectacular. Lots of information in",
          "Lots of fish tanks, dolphins show. the explanations are also in English. Lots of other attractions nearby.",
          "A must go. I definitely suggest that you follow the agenda of the aquarium and not miss the feeding sessions of the manatees, dolphins and sting rays.... We went on a weekday and did not find any school groups which was great. With the aquarium ticket then there are discounts to",
          "This would be a great aquarium if it didn't have the manatees & dolphins caged in. I went because my wife really wanted to and I'm not too proud to admit I balled my eyes out when I saw the beautiful manatees in such a small space. And I lost it again when I saw the dolphins",
          "Wonderful aquarium very informative fishlook very well cared for. Contains not only fish but also reptiles. Premises also has a picnic area, fast food cafe and restaurant.",
          "Good little aquarium with plenty to see. Feeljng kind of sorry for the manatees and dolphins for their small enclosures though. I must say that I think the Ripleys one in Toronto is better.",
          "Having been to many aquariums on 3 continents, I found the layout of Genoa\u2019s aquarium to be very refreshing and engaging. The aquarium is split over 2 levels which enables you to see many of the exhibits from above water too. A lot of thought had been put into backdrop to the",
          "Good Aquarium, just too expensive. There are a lot of different animals and it's very big, but 27 \u20ac for an adult was a lot of money.",
          "A great way to spend a few hours in Genoa. We loved the layout that made sure you saw everything. We saw dolphins being fed and touched rays. The coral reef display is stunning",
          "So we bought the 26\u20ac ticket to skip the line and it was a smart ting to do! We went Sunday morning but inside of aquarium was full with family and kids, was kind of hard to see in the tanks. We spend 4 hours in there, but had to take break many times cuz it was to warm and a lot",
          "We bought a 50 Euro combination ticket which allowed access to a range of harbor attractions including the aquarium, biosphere, the maritime museum and a small submarine. The aquarium itself was value for the money. A stunning range of tropical fish, small sharks and dolphins on",
          "the aquarium is definitely one of the best in Europe, you will have a lot of tanks to enjoy. it need a bit refreshing honestly but is definitely a great place and worth a visit",
          "We spent almost three hours. Learned a lot Took some great photos. Great family outing. Upper and lower floor exhibits. Up close with dolphins. Amazing pirate ship next door. Many shops around this area.",
          "Not much to say about the aquarium. Very well maintained and nice collection of animals. Full recommendation! One thing to be cautious though: there's a butterfly section towards the end for which they charge another 2EUR on top of the already expensive 26EUR entrance fee. It's",
          "What a fantastic place to visit. A little pricey ( just short of \u20ac100 for 4 adults and 1 child, but well worth every penny. Average time spent there is around 2 and half hours.",
          "Many fish to see. Very interesting and depending on the day quite cheap. I also loved the area around it..",
          "Went in January with friends and the aquarium was very very quiet, felt like we were the only people walking around. Only thing was it was hard to get to the entrance to the aquarium because there were so many men outside trying to sell you things aggressively that it scared us",
          "Probably the only nice attraction in Genova, very interesting, but it is not as big as i was expected to be and it was almost impossible to see the dolphins, because the exposure was very dark.",
          "Nice location, good for family and friends. Always something new to see. Not so cheap but it is worth to spend a couple of hours there. Easy to reach by car and train.",
          "I love a good aquarium and this one is fantastic. Terrific range of exhibits, the animals are well looked after and the displays and curation are terrific - I was surprised by just how good it is. I would gladly come again and can't recommend it highly enough - amongst the",
          "The place was a swarming throng of excited children. While I should have expected this, it was worse than I imagined and impacted negatively on my experienced. That said, the range of sea creatures wasn\u2019t as expansive as I had expected for the largest aquarium in Europe. The",
          "Brilliant family day out. Tickets can be bought online or at the venue. The standard ticket is sufficient for a days activities. The additional aspects are in Italian so may not be worth the extra money. Definitely watch the dolphins - one of the highlights!",
          "What\u2019s the best age to take a child to an acquarium? So many inside who didn\u2019t seem interested in the fish at all. The parents were all keen though. Ticket entry is expensive but there are a lot of exhibits. Wished the dolphins had a bigger tank ....",
          "I had been to lots of aquariums in many cities and this one is among the best that I had visited. It\u2019s large and will easily take 3 hours to complete if you want to see everything. I enjoyed watching the dolphins being fed. Forget the VR experience. Waste of time.",
          "We have been to many aquariums but devoted a day to visiting the Genoa aquarium. It is quite different and well presented. They take you through a series of rooms, each devoted to a certain species or theme. It was different from all other aquariums we have visited...and",
          "Husband who is is in a wheelchair and I visited last week and the price for us in total as a concession was euro 23. Everywhere can be accessed by wheelchair, slopes and lifts at various points are available. Displays are clean and exhibits are healthy. Our favourites were the",
          "Went there for a business presentation - something I wasn\u2019t particularly excited for. Turned out to be fun, entertaining, educational and amazed me in a very unexpected way. It\u2019s very well organised, state of the art presentations , great respect for the animals (it\u2019s not just",
          "A fantastic aquarium, many types of fish and more. The penguins are beautiful, I would have stayed for hours to watch them. In the restaurant we also eat well.",
          "I don't mind as much spending money on things that improve the world. I wish they would release the dolphins, but it was very well organized and I am happy that I was able to see it.",
          "There is a lot to walk and to learn. You can see plenty of fish with name and description. An interesting picture of marine wildlife that can teach a lot about the sea life. The most attractive point is the dolphin area, and you can see the above and from a side when you",
          "love the acquarium and the work the marine biologists do here. Great place to take kids for an educational tour. Animals look well taken care of.",
          "Visited the Genoa aquarium at the end of our cruise, having heard it was the largest in Europe and we were not disappointed. Having been to Barcelona Aquarium earlier in the week just showed how much better the living conditions were at Genoa. Viewing windows to see the",
          "The Genoa Aquarium is right next to the NH Genoa Marina Hotel where we stayed. It is bright blue and a structure like to seabed or the bottom of a blue ocean tanker. It hosts a huge variety of sea life ranging from dolphins, penguins, sharks and colourful tropical fish. The",
          "Overall excellent experience, which should please both adults and kids. Pros: - beautiful tanks with everything from jellyfish to sharks - good location in the harbor Cons: - dolphin show not as spectacular as similar types of aquariums - could feel expensive for larger",
          "One of the better aquariums I've seen. Maybe not that modern-looking, but filled with great species in spacious water-tanks. Ticket is not cheap, but in my opinion it's worth it. A must-see. Highly recommended.",
          "Having been to the Boston Aquarium (great), Ripley's here in Toronto (underwhelming) and the two Aquariums in Japan (Okinawa and Osaka, both the best ones), I had a pretty good idea of what to expect from the Acquario di Genova; it did not disappoint. The box office appears to",
          "This is a fairly large Aquarium with quite a few impressive exhibitions of sea life. While it is larger than most aquariums, my feeling is that the ones in Baltimore, USA and in Monterey, USA have more of the Wow factor. Still, this aquarium is worth a visit.",
          "Huge variety of underwater creatures. Never new that existed. I actually spend themost of my Day there. Also the ticket price was normal.",
          "A bit pricey, but well worth a visit. You will need at least 3 hours to visit the aquarium and get your monies worth. Great variety of fish and sharks to get up close to. A perfect way to spend some hours on a rainy day as a couple or with the kids.",
          "Not a lover off aquariums but this place is amazing we stayed for hours . Not just your normal aquatic experience. Well worth a visit",
          "I\u2019ve been thinking about whether to go to the Aquarium of Genova or not for quite some time, since 26 euro for a ticket is kind of a big deal for a student on a low budget. In the end I decided to give it a try (also because it was raining a lot that day). and I can honestly say",
          "One of the better aquariums I\u2019ve visited. Very much worth the \u20ac26. No need for a skip the line ticket. Definitely plan a few hours to see it all. Seals, dolphins, colorful fish. Mesmerizing for our 7 months old smallest guest - and plenty of context for the adults in the group.",
          "We had 2 hours to kill and went in. We have seen some aquariums in our life. This one is clearly top. Educational, entertaining, interactive, clean and animals seem well treated.",
          "We liked the visit to the aquarium, it is big and has manatees and dolphins which you don\u2019t find easily in other aquariums. It has a nice section were you can touch stingray.... worthy to visit for a couple of hours.",
          "The aquarium is really at the port and there is a lot to see there which is also nice. We enjoyed our time inside - they really maintain it well. We also did the VR Experience and we visited the garden with the butterflies and small birds. The terrace was also great to relax",
          "There is a lot to see at this aquarium and you will do well to get round it in less than 2 hours. We were impressed with the variety of species and they seem to be kept in good conditions. Definitely worth a visit though as is often the case with aquariums it\u2019s no cheap.",
          "I spent an afternoon at the Aquarium of Genoa. The location of the aquarium was absolutely stunning, especially with the Biosfera right next to it! Pertaining to the animals, they had a good variety: including dolphins. I honestly believe the dolphins were just as entertained by",
          "I think it is extremely beautiful place for people who are interested in fish and underwater nature. For me it was overrated. Useful information: dolphins' training lasts around 10 minutes and is in Italian language. No translation of course. The most inspiring place - aquarium",
          "Not if you have been to Noumea! The problem with the Aquarium is that it does the 'exotic' things well like warm/tropical climate...like where we live. Unfortunately we went to learn more about the Mediterranean Sea life and that was quite pedestrian sadly. The highlight for",
          "We have been to lots of aquariums and my favourite is currently the one in Atlanta, Georgia which is outstanding. This one has tired exhibits, tanks which look dirty and uncared for, where some are so dingy that you can barely see through the \"glass\". The dolphins looked sad",
          "This is the best aquarium we have been to, including those in Chicago and Atlanta. It took us 3+ hours to go through. The tanks and habitats were exceptionally clean, the exhibits were well designed, and the variety of exhibits spanning the globe was remarkable. We bought a",
          "This is one of the best aquariums I\u2019ve been to, well worth a visit. It is well designed so that even on a busy Saturday it didn\u2019t feel too full. Would be excellent for children, with lots of photos and information boards. Watching the dolphins and their talk at 12 was a",
          "Floating fish, soothing music, hours of engagement. Worth every minute. Children will love it. Right in the heart of the porta antica.",
          "We visited the Aquarium based on recommendations and weren't disappointed. The displays are on par with any others that we've seen around the world. There are touch pools and interactive areas for children. I recommend buying the combination ticket for access to the Biosphere",
          "Just reduce the price of the photograph that you are selling. 10 Euros are too expensive. Make it 5. More people will purchase.",
          "The aquarium is beautiful with factual and friendly exhibits, a dolphin show, and a virtual reality activity (for a few extra euro). There was even a behind the scenes tour offered - but only in Italian. This can easily be a 2-3 hour event - depending on your pace - with a",
          "A wonderful experience from the start to finish as there are plenty of interests for all ages. A variety of specimen collections all very well spread out and a unique experience to view intriguing living creatures that make our planet so wonderful.",
          "First the positives, well laid out, informative and well signposted. Thought it was expensive at 26 euros each, looking a bit tied and we are not really sure, in this day and age, about having captive Manatees, Dolpins and penguins in baically smallish tanks.",
          "On a rainy day here in Genoa, I decided to check out the famous aquarium here. The entry price is a little high, I\u2019ll admit, but the experience was great! This place is indeed huge and has a lot of exhibits! The best is the dolphin exhibit, and try to be there when they put on a",
          "Great aquarium - looks a little dated on the outside but inside is spectacular! Little expensive and shame they try and get more money with \u201cadd ons\u201d throughout the visit - 3D dive experience you have to pay extra for as well as the butterfly\u2019s 26 Euro a ticket - expensive but",
          "Travelled from Milan to visit this aquarium expecting it to be amazing as some blogs has written it to be top 10 in Europe. It was really mediocre. It wasn\u2019t very big and the tanks were small for some marine life... especially the manatee tank! The one in Lisbon was breath",
          "Excellent day out. Lots to see. My husband and I had a fabulous time. Good value for money brought tickets on web before we came.",
          "Wonderful and exciting experience especially the dolphin show. We would recommend to visit this acquarium to anyone visiting Genoa.",
          "Extraordinary aquarium-well organized, clean, intelligently designed. They have spectacular tanks of sharks, fish, turtles, jellyfish, coral, etc. For those of us who appreciate the cute and cuddly factor , it is well handled by penguins, manatees, dolphins and seals. A most",
          "I have done different aquariums around the world found this one to be overpriced for what I saw. $26.00 euro.",
          "People of all ages were enthralled by the creatures in the various aquariums. Particularly popular were the cheeky penguins, the playful dolphins, the amusing seals and the graceful manatees. There were also a few aquarium dedicated to particular habitats eg coral reef. Other",
          "The aquarium was one of our favourite activities in Genoa. Very well organized and beautiful presentation. Lots of variety and some interactive activities for families. Most displays are labelled in English as well as Italian. It took us about 4 hours to go through. We bought",
          "Seen many aquariums in various countries & this has got to be one of the best. Despite looking drab from the outside it is stunning inside. Questionable about having such large mammals in captivity as Dolphins , but seemed ok.",
          "Having heard that this is the best aquarium in Europe we had to visit, and the first major exhibit is the Manatees, they were so lovable(!!) The tanks are massive and seeing the Dolphins swimming in such a large area almost stifled the thoughts that they would all be better off",
          "After many bad experiences with other aquariums ( SeaLife, Livorno... which are not worth more than 40 minutes of visit ) this one in Genova was really big and had many new species to see and a good documentation on each bassin. So it is easy to spend here more than 2 hours. For",
          "Good place not only for children, but for adults too :) I think this is the biggest European aquarium!",
          "This is a nice aquarium and great to see with kids. My girls ages 10 and 9 enjoyed the Aquarium especially interacting with the Harbor Seals. The Aquarium can be crowded in August even on a Monday morning, here are a few tips, pre-buy your tickets in advanced online and go for",
          "This is the most amazing aquarium with so many different species displayed in very well designed tanks. If you\u2019re in Genoa it\u2019s a must!",
          "Great place with countless great attractions. It's a place interesting for everybody. If you are in Genova you must visit!",
          "Kids are so happy and grownups too. It is a perfect way to learn, spend time and have fun. I would suggest to visit the aquarium in the morning. It takes at least two and half hours excluded the biosphere and activities.",
          "If you are interested in creatures that lives in water, you should visit this place. Bad thing it was a little bit expensive.",
          "My husband and I visited the Aquarium in Genoa. It is the largest Aquarium in Italy. It was wonderful and extremely clean. They provided a lot of information on the different fish and sea life we saw, and it was easy to visit. We really enjoyed it a lot and would recommend it if",
          "Very educative place where you can spend even few hours exploring both under and overwater world and admiring endangered species",
          "We all know that Genoa Aquarium is the largest in Europe, but no matter of the size it's worth a visit. That was our third visit of the aquarium and it's nice to see the cganges and the improvements they make. Take the time to explore it in your own pace, sit in front of the",
          "We had a great time at the aquarium. Just getting there and see the huge pirate ship outside made my children so happy. As the biggest Aquarium in Europe there is so much to see and will need a few hours to cover it all. The dolphin show was a big attraction. It is really a must",
          "We took a tour with english guide around the aquarium, and it was the best idea ever! Instead of simply looking at fishes, we got a bit of behind the scene of aquarium life, how it is operated, how the feed the fishes and clean the tanks... cool for kids and adults!",
          "We had a fabulous time at the aquarium, slightly worried that it wouldn't be worth the money - but it totally is. So much to see and keep even little ones amused. Loos, bins and seats all over - as it's quite a trek. You need at least the 2hrs 45 mins they recommend. It is",
          "Many people can say thst 26 euro is too much and you can visit some museums instead of it.But I like it: dolphins and lamantins are amazing!It is really great to go there with children:a lot of things for them.Great view to the city.I can only say that there are too many",
          "The aquarium itself was nice and clean but we didn\u2019t think it was anything special. We\u2019ve been to worse(such as London) which was very over crowded and small. We at least had a lot of space here. The only unique thing to see here was the manities.",
          "Large intelligent mammals like dolphins need rich environments with lots of stimulation and space. For me the dolphin show was just tragic. The rest of the aquarium is in many places interesting and some effort seems to have been made to consider the welfare of the animals. I'd",
          "There are a lot of fish and water animals to see. As you walk throughout the aquarium, time tends to fly by without notice and yet there are still so many things left to see. Although it doesn't feel too long. Spent 4 hours in there wondering from room to room, always looking",
          "Really enjoyed it. Dolphin viewing area absolutely fantastic. One suggestion would be a cheaper ticket for just seeing the dolphins, as then I think people would return a second / third time to see them over and over again.",
          "Nice place to visit.It took us more than 2 hours.The kids were amazed and we had a good time. The near museum maritima Galata was near by the aquarium and was also amazing.Thanks Genova",

          "Done a few aquariums. London, Barcelona, Hunstanton (\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23). Genoa by far the biggest but, the best? Quite expensive too. Couple of options for add ons can also empty wallet of extra Euro which, frankly, are poor. If never taken your kids to an aquarium then do it but, if you",
          "Good welcome from receptionists and by technicians during the detailed visit and after when we were offered a tea",
          "The exterior view of this aquarium is deceiving -- it is much larger that you expect. The elegant lay-out brings you back and forth, level-by-level and is a real treat. Its a short walk thru the historic section of Genoa and to the Pier area...if you make the trip you won't be",
          "We had a great time in the aquarium. Everyone was excited and enjoy the time there, the personal of the aquarium was super helpful (especially as we had our pram ). Our little kid try to touch the fish in the fish pool, and make friend with a scuba diver (was cleaning one",
          "Me, my partner and our 6 year old went today. We were there for a total of 3 hours. It was an amazing experience from start to finish. The biggest aquarium in Europe didn't disappoint. I think the only aquatic species not on show were whales. Watching the dolphins swimming",

There was show with dolphins \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d they are so smart and beautiful! And penguins, they are sooo lovely and many other fishes, you can find all whom lives in the water.

          "As a family we often seem to end up in aquariums when on holiday and have been to aquariums all over Europe. This one recommends itself by stating that it is the largest in Europe. It is probably the most expensive too! Personally if you\u2019ve been to one you know what you\u2019re going",
          "The aquarium was so busy that we didn\u2019t have chance to get a good look round as people were hoggin the tanks. I really think they should have a limit on the amount of people they let in. In addition to this I wa quite upset to see some fish had tanks way too small for their size.",
          "The Genoa aquarium is a unique experience. We visited the aquarium, me, my wife, a 4 year old and a 10 month old. The visit has fascinated us adults but has really impressed our 4 year old. In some rooms it seems to be really inside the ocean. Face to face with dolphins. A",
          "We went on a rainy day with 2 kids. My husband and my brother-in-law queued for almost an hour for 6 tickets. There are quite a lot to see and easily spend 3 or 4 hours in the aquarium. Dolphines, manatees, penguins are the stars, not only kids love them adults too.",
          "The aquarium is good, but certainly not the biggest and best in Europe. The manatees are especially fascinating. Unfortunately the experience was spoiled by uncontrolled noisy school kids. I'm not sure they were getting much out of their trip, and it was certainly not adding",
          "At the entrance everybody pass through a photo generating an annoying jam with no space to move. Inside some additional unannounced payments for some sections. Delphines were closed due to the rain. We spent 1 hour and 15 min for the whole route and I don't believe this is the",
          "School hols so the place was over run with push chairs and kids running around. Enjoyed looking st fish but be careful when buying tickets online I paid also for the lift which when we got there was not in operation therefore paid too much for entrance tickets.",
          "Just 10 mins walk from the cruise ship terminal (all under shade) and well worth a look especially the dolphins and manatees. Get there early to get a ticket if you want to go in straight away or they do entry times when busy. Much quieter at lunchtime so worth booking tickets",
          "The Aquarium of Genoa is one of the placed I recommend to all travellers simulating the sea life and facilities around is good as well",
          "Was a great great experience. I am not a big fan of fish and water creatures but I really had a great time when I visited the Aquarium. Our type was for couples but I think for families with kids would definitely be a good visit!",
          "On the leaflet it says this is the largest aquarium in Europe. But we visited Valencia aquarium last year and it was much bigger. It cost \u20ac70 for myself, my partner and our daughter.. we were only in there for a couple of hours. There was some lovely big tanks to look at, which",
          "Visited this as an excursion on an MSC Cruise ship. I have to say I never have found fish very interesting but this was amazing! You follow the map a set route so you do not miss anything. We paid a couple of extra euros to do the virtual reality experience which was enjoyable.",
          "Beautiful aquarium, nice (small) shows and absolutely worth seeing. We spent 5 hours in the aquarium and couldn't get enough of all the species, the dolphins, the whales etc. Beautiful!",
          "Must see place to visit. A lot of different species to see. Dolphin show is great. Definitely worth seeing.",
          "Apart from a mildly irritating website booking system. We arrived and were greated by staff and always helped and directed in English to elevators as we had a buggy. An impressive space with an array of different learning zones to enjoy. Caffetria serves great quality food and",
          "Overall a great learning and fun experience, definitely recommended for families and adults too. We spent the whole day inside so keep this in mind when planning your activities for the day.",

          "We went there at 3pm with two children (4 and 7 years) and we were suprised how big it was. So many things to see and explore. The kids loved the place and we spent over 2 hours enjoying ourselves. Really recommend to go there. Not overcrowded and relaxed, even on a sunday",
          "A must do if you are in the area. We traveled 1hr each way to come here and it was worth it! Check the time of the different shows though as we missed a couple",
          "Not at all state of the art - not well maintained and far too expensive for what is shown. Some basins not nice, even a little dirty. No places to sit and rest (only at the dolphins\u2019 basin), which belongs to the more ugly ones as described before. Only a lot of glas wall does",
          "I have never been to aquarium before, so when I visited Genova last week I went there. The place is amazing, you get to see all kinds of animals (dolphins, tortoise, snakes etc). IF you go to Genoa, it is a must see.",
          "There was a lot of fish, but nothing really impressive. Booring that there was no dolphins in the big tank in the end. The dolphins was jut playing around for themselves. We had to see them outside, from a distanse.",
          "We went there at the of the day and would definitely spend more time there! The aquarium has a lot to see, different types of fishes and corrals. We just could not see the show of Dolphins.",
          "Hello, We had a very pleasant experience ar the Aquarium. You must go and visit it, especially if you are with your family. The kids will love it. They also have a cafeteria where you can grab some fast food. Enjoy!",
          "this large aquarium is in the port of Genoa. if you are coming from a cruise liner, you can walk to it. takes about 2-3 hours and has good collection. diferent types of fishes, sharks, dolphins, jelly fish and many other aquatic species. price is about \u20ac26.00 for adults. there",
          "Our two boys (10 and 12) really enjoyed the visit, as did my wife and I. There was so much to see. Well presented with lots of interesting information, too. The highlight for us was watching the dolphins play with balls/foam toys, and to see them swimming together. Also enjoyed",
          "Not wanting to seem pessimistic, but i'm not a fan of caged/tanked animals. I came here with my gf because she wanted to. :-) Objectively speaking, it is a good quality aquarium compared with others I have visited (including some famous ones in other areass of the world). For",
          "This is the best place to visit in Genoa. I was enjoyed to seed aquatic animals near by me. you will enjoy different animals like fishes, birds and so on. You will be taken in different rooms with alive organisms. It was my first time to see sea animals closer to me.",
          "We saw every kind of fish we have heard of. And.many more we never heard of. Somehow we missed whales though - not sure if they are there.",
          "We went there as a family, we only did the aquarium, not the other attractions. Our children are quite young and at the end of our visit to the aquarium we were glad we didn't do more. However, we didn't stay in Genoa too long, so maybe if we'd been there longer, we would have",
          "It seemed a little pricey to be honest and after the first room we thought oh no this is going to be terrible! Thankfully we could not have been more wrong!! Room after room of amazing exhibits which we thoroughly enjoyed for a few hours. Go and have a look it is awesome.",
          "Very nice view on the living creatures of the ocean. Only a pitty we didn't see any show of the dolphins. But the diversity of fishes and the way they are exposed is very nice.",
          "Shortly, it was breathtaking. Even the order of the scenes were well selected. Not to mention the content. We saw all the must see animals and they were within a reach. The reason I gave only 4 is because I think that the VR should be improved or free of charge. Same with the",
          "It was definitely fantastic experience for us and our kids. Being so close to all this animals is simply amazing!",
          "This is just a amazing experience for everyone.You will see all shorts of creatures from the ocean. Special thanks to penguins who were super entertaining! Sharks and dolphins were also great. Dolphins you can see above and under the water which was super. It was like an ballet",

          "Our whole family has enjoyed very much the aquarium . The exhibition is well organised and is easy to follow. Cafeteria was to small for the number of visitors, but let this not distract you from the real excitement.",
          "My 9 year old enjoyed it. Shame the dolphin pool was being cleaned so no show. But I wasn't that keen on seeing dolphins perform in a swimming pool anyway.",
          "Would definitely recommend if you plan on spending a few days in Genoa. Enjoyed the aquarium, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend paying for the full price version or the add ons as they seem very small. Be warned at the moment the dolphin and manatee tanks are undergoing",
          "Great fun for a couple of hours with loads of exhibits. Unfortunately the viewing area for the dolphins wasn't open, which would've been nice to know before paying an ambitious \u20ac26 entry fee per adult (only reason I gave 4 stars). Regardless there was lots to do and see, with",
          "Magical. It's quite big, so make sure to invest a couple of hours. Moreover, make sure that you finish your visit an hour before closing time, because they push you to leave (with their way) 45 mins before closing time. Lagoon of mermaids is the highlight for a person that has",
          "It wasn\u2019t as impressive as the literature says. It isn\u2019t that big. Takes 90 minutes to see everything. It is a place more suited for kids. There is another aquarium more impressive in Valencia Spain",

          "As my kids like aquariums, we have seen quite a few, however this one stood out positively! Quite quick to get in (not cheap), outside mwah, but inside amazing. Many fish, cool aquariums with fish I have never seen (sword sharks, manatees, etc.) in an aquarium. Great way to",

          "I am a HUGE marine life fan and this visit simply took my breath away. There are a variety of tickets available ranging from 23-54 EUR, I opted for the 35 EUR ticket which gave you access to the aquarium, biosphere and botanical garden. The map of the aquarium was available in",
          "The best thing you do as a family visit to Genoa. So informative and great for both children and adults.",

          "I took this place for granted. It's a great place that is never too busy and perfect for a family or little ones. It's a bit pricey but worth it. When you compare it to a place like Ripley's Aquarium in Toronto it is leaps and bounds better. Quiet atmosphere with appropriate",
          "We booked before leaving UK and purchased a multi ticket for the aquarium, tropical garden, biosphere and lift. Would highly recommend the aquarium we were in there a few hours. Bad points..not clear on tickets that the biosphere is NOT the tropical bit..in the aquarium building",

          "I was not sure about visiting the aquarium bec was a bit expensive for my budget but the visit totally paid EACH CENT. Well organized, huge and amazing variety of sea animals...incredible. Would definitely recommend and visit again. Even though I dont like 100 per cent the idea",

          "Although a bit expensive (26 euros p.p) we enjoy the 2 hours we spend in the aquarium of Genova. Its great fun especially for kids.",
          "This was a very nice, well-maintained clean aquarium. It was a great way to spend a morning. Not really enough exhibits to warrant more than 2-3 hours. Also, beware of the incredibly aggressive peddlers stalking the entrance. They literally grabbed the wrists of my children",
          "Highly recommended! very nice place with the posibility to take very nice pictures. The animals were amazing, and I will say some of them were happy !",
          "I went there with all my family and the kids liked it. The fish are great and the place is cleaned and organized BUUUUT it's not as \"wow\" and huge as they advertise and compared to the American acquarium it's a real disappointment. I honestly believe that they could and they",
          "It's a good Aquarium - would be interesting to see what data they use to claim this one is the largest in Europe but nevertheless, it was a good time spent. Entry is 26 euro for adults. Be careful of the dodgy people asking for money or trying to sell you stuff near the ticket",
          "Everything you would expect plus dolphins playing, sharks,sawfish and manatees. There were good viewing areas for penguins and seals.",
          "We come from Queensland, Australia where there are several large aquariums so we were a little disappointed with this one after reading the ads. We had a few hours to while away after a Mediterranean cruise so more old buildings etc. were not on our list. A lot of walking around",
          "It was a bad experience... it was totally crowded, too many people and it was almost impossible to see something without hit someone... The dolphings habe not enought space and in one of the fish areas, people could put the hands inside the water...no one from the aquarium was",
          "The Aquarium is such an amazing place! All the fish, all the displays and all the activities are worth for an afternoon visit!",
          "This place is an interesting one.... if it weren't for the dolphins we would have asked for a refund. It's too busy and there is no policing of the amount of people walking around. Overcrowded and noisy! Sadly, most of these fish / animals were in too small cages and looked",
          "Any attraction which takes longer to actually get into that the time you spend in it is always going to struggle for a good review. This may be and probably is the biggest aquarium in Europe and is probably also the busiest attraction in Genoa (be warned)! An hour or so to queue",
          "Had a fab time. Probably the best aquarium I have visited. Amazing view of the dolphins. I would definitely recommend booking your tickets in advance so you can skip the mile long queue!",
          "Seems a bit expensive at27\u20ac per person but when you get in its worth every penny Get their in time for the Dolphins and the show Am impressive array of fish etc on display all very well cared for and very clean I'd reckoned a trip here",
          "Went on Easter Sunday with my boyfriend. My tickets were never emailed to me so I was really panicking about trying to get them printed. Went to the help desk, really helpful and polite staff. We then went to the entrance line as we had a designated time slot ( the undesignated",
          "We have visited many aquariums all over the world and this was the worst experience we've ever had. We waited on line for 30 min to buy tickets then had to come back 1h30min later to wait on line again for 15 min only to get inside and find the entire aquarium to be one huge",
          "Our visit at the aquarium was magnificent overall, the fish are all kept very well and seemed happy. I wished they included one or two more smoking areas as the visit is quite long! Also I would suggest that the parking might be partly refunded to incentive ppl visit this",
          "I enjoyed myself as much as my little son did. Every pavilion was a surprise and an adventure. Moreover, this was the most interactive aquarium we have ever been in. It is very well maintained and there are lots of places to take a rest, if you need one. We had an amazing time.",
          "The place is worth a visit. Not hard to find. The largest aquarium in Italy with many different marine creatures. A well organized sea life exhibition. It's all clean. Friendly staff. I liked the most sharks and dolphins. You can buy something to remember in the store.",
          "As someone who has had a lifelong love of the ocean and studied environmental conservation at university, I always have high hopes for aquariums. I can say with certainty that this aquarium has surpassed all expectations in every way possible. From the start there a spectacular",
          "At the first half of my visit I was wondering why I paid \u20ac26 to see the aquarium. But then I found out they had dolphins! The place is really worth the visit. Everything is clean, a nice variety of animals, friendly staff (they can help you in English). I would go ther again. I",
          "Italy's biggest aquarium has everything you could want to while away a few hours. The kids will love the sharks and dolphins, and you'll enjoy the cafe too!",
          "Great aquarium, with good views of all the fish. Some labels needed up dating. I loved the manatee who held the lettuce in its' fins to eat it - all the while balancing on its' tail! The ray pool was good too, where you allowed to touch the fish if they come to you.",
          "A big aquarium with lots of different sea creatures. Definitely one of the best in Europe. Well laid out, with informative descriptions in English.",
          "Of course you're going to the aquarium! Wonderful experience. Not the biggest, but worth the trip. A bit expensive tho :-/",
          "It\u2019s a nice place with a lot of Medusa:)) you need about 3 hours to see everything. It\u2019s a perfect place to go with family and friends.",
          "Its located in port and easily accesible.Tanks vary in size and animals which are inside.Staff really seems to care about the animals,which is very nice to see.",
          "Fascinating educational aquarium with interesting animals displayed. Very well organised and planned out. Equally fun for kids and adults. Reasonable prices, friendly staff. Definitely one of the best aquariums I have visited. One more reason to love genoa.",
          "Superb Aquarium. Perfect collection of all species of underwater bio diversities. Dolphin training session was mind capturing but dolphin training session should be conducted in English language.",
          "This is a must even if you are in Genova only for a couple of days. This place is so natural, educational, well-thought and planned, that it's really amazing. I went there with my daughter and my husband and at first I thought that it would be a little boring for the",
          "My wife and I visited the Genova Aquarium while on a Mediterranean cruise this past December. It was one of the best aquariums we have ever been to and we have been to many across the world. This one definitely lived up to it's reputation and blew us away. The dolphin exhibit",
          "The biggest acquarium in Europe is located in the old port of Genova, worth a visit and is a family friendly structure even if for some add-on experience you have to pay. More staff should br needed, especially when a lot of screaming children are around.",
          "Large Aquarium and amazing. Quite crowded during holidays but it is a must when in Genova with children.",
          "It has all the main attractions expected in an aquarium. However, having a kid and being a round the world traveler this is not on my top list.",
          "The aquarium in general is your another everyday decent aquarium. The walls and floors are a bit dirty sometimes, but this is something you'd expect from such places. The exibition itself were good. There are information planks that gives you general knowledge about every other",
          "The Genoa Aquarium is considered one of the best aquariums in Europe - and it certainly lived up to its name. The aquarium is great for all ages, as it's massive - there are several floors full of exhibits. There's also a lot of wildlife and marine life that you don't see at",
          "probably our best experience in the city of Genova. a very nice aquarium, very rich in terms of species and well located. an experience we recommend to anyone who is visiting Genova.",
          "Best place to visit for someone who loves animals, nature and everything regarding the oceans! It is a lenghty visit so make enought time so you can enjoy every atraction in its fullest! Highly recommend!",
          "My son was ecstatic. He said: Mommy, this is a dream come true!! Great place for families, if you book tickets in advance you dont have to queue up for long, it was generally a very good experience. Definitely worth visiting!",
          "Comprehensive and big exhibition space with a lot of interesting species, exhibits and activities. Good for couples, families and adults as well. My favorite part was the stingray petting. Full price ticket is not cheap but a great deal of special price entries are available. It",
          "Our visit to the aquarium was a beautiful experience. Not only for the kids, but also for adults. A lovely place!",
          "It is definitely not a typical Italian scenic spot, but something really different and worth visiting after seeing dozens of historical sites, especially for children and sea lovers. My friend and I just wanted to escape from the searing sun in summer, but were left fascinated",
          "Enjoyed very much, best was behind the scenes.My children loved the trip. We were in the acquarium for more than 5 hours, Dolphins amazing.",
          "Wonderful!!!6th visit and still amazing, probably will be there next year too! Loved the butterflies",
          "Love it! We visit it in the middle of the week and entered as soon as aquarium opened the door so we were actually alone all the way throu. It is the biggest aquarium that we visit it till then. The number of spicies is enormous. We really enyojed our time there.",
          "One of the best things to do when in Genoa. It offers entertainment for 3-4 hours minimum, but one can easily spend here a day as well. There is an amazing variety of different sea animals. There are various programs as well, like feeding, different shows etc. There were many",
          "I was with my wife and daughter(1 year old). I have to admit taking tickets in advance was good idea. Variety of sealife was excellent but this Aquarium was over crowded and to see something you had to force yourself thru a group of people which is not easy with children.",
          "I think it was a very nice visit. I just missed a little bit more of interaction with the animals. Maybe a 3d show, something more fun, instead of just walking by them, like in a zoo. But in general the aquarium is very beatiful and you can tell it\u00b4s always clean and good",
          "It had a variety of creatures, some you can even touch, a place to eat, inside and outside things to see, etc. We all loved it and had such a fun time!",
          "I had the opportunity to visit the Aquarium of Genova. It is rather large and full of different species of fish. Friendly to families with a stroller! Take care that the ticket price is a little high! Also being next to the seaside you cannot find a free parking (if you arrive",
          "The aquarium is well kept and very nice. Also there is plenty of information boards around. Only how the dolphins and pinguins were kept, somehow didn't appeal to me. Especially doing the tricks with the dolphins wasn't necessary. I understand it attracts people, but there",
          "Really interesting visit, kids were obviously astonished in front of the pools and colours, the dolphins and sharks were really collaborating with great activity in the water. Nice display, overall good quality in the services and cleaning, good organization.",
          "The water world of Genoa, Located in the old harbor of the city. In the attraction, there are about 70 water tanks that show over 400 species of water animals such as: various sizes of fish, jellyfish, sea horses, seals, sharks and dolphins. Feeding sharks and dolphins can be",
          "Excellent aquarium, not usually a fan of them but we had a very enjoyable 2.5 hours spent walking around the aquarium.",
          "We (family with daughters aged 6 and 3) got here right after our cruise. At first the building, which hosts the aquarium is nothing much, but it holds many treasures. Everything is nicely set, it has enough space so it's not overcrowded. The highlights are the dolphins, penguins",
          "The aquarium itself is fairly impressive. A wide variety of exhibits, interesting to see and beautiful creatures. But wow, is it expensive for a visit. We spent maybe two hours in there and it cost \u20ac25 or there about each. And there's a lot of weird sponsorship going on with",
          "A lot of aquatic creatures which visitors can watch through the long walkway. For us, this was second best after the Valencia one.",
          "I have visited a number public zoo's an aquariums, with a big interest in what species are being kept, and the set-up's they have been provided with. I must say that this aquarium took me by surprise. Parking is not the easiest or the cheapest so do your research first. We",
          "If you like aquariums and it's a rainy day, why not. Otherwise, it's just pretty expensive and rather shameless that they have certain attractions where they request even more money (VR experience, butterfly exhibit, 15\u20ac for 2 souvenier photos in front of the green screen).",
          "This is the biggest aquarium in Europe, I really enjoyed seeing Gods life under the sea. My favorite was the penquins. Oh and the military/veterans gets a discount w I.D.. Go early to beat the lines. You wont regret it. I really enjoyed myself, I oooh and aaah'd like I was a kid",
          "Went to the Acquario di Genova yesterday. It's marvellously arranged, with all the climatic areas of the world and the marine fauna thereof. It's only when we emerged that we realised how tired we were, with aching legs, having spent 2 and a half hours on our feet! Highlights",
          "I definitely enjoyed the aquarium especially the penguins, however there were a large variety of seafaring creatures. Great for adults and kids.",
          "Whether you were a fish fan or not, the visual impact, brilliant presentation and information both scientific and general will fascinate you. There seemed to be plenty to keep young children amused too. My only complaint is the entry fee. I realize a place like this has",
          "I enjoyed the aquarium , it was big enough and probably the highlights are the dolphins aquarium (one of them kept smiling and swimming close to me) and the interactive pool where you can touch a small size kind of stingrays .. the only downside was i thought it is expensive at",
          "Nice place,but sky high prices! The aquarium itself is very big, but 25 euro is too much considering also that for most attractions you have to pay a supplement..Greedy, greedy, greedy !",
          "I had so much fun i loved this place \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f the dolphins are funny and lovely they made a nice show and i saw many types of fish i had never seen",
          "The best aquarium I've ever been too.Really great only a little expensive for a family but still worth it.a good hour and half to 2 hours spent in there.",
          "This was a really interesting day out. Not just about fish and aquatic mammals, but about corals and other things in or near the sea (like mangrove swamps). Most pools can be viewed from the side and also from above. The various pools are large and interestingly set up; there",
          "We had the luck of catching the morming and noon dolphin shows. Seeing one above water and one below water was a unique experience. Same goes for petting the mantra fish. This aquarium provides different sea and water topics which is different from ordinary aquariums.",
          "The acquario is truly brilliant you can spend the whole day here so much to see. The food choices are excellent and tasty. Excellent service. The dolphins were so amazing! A must see when in Genova.",
          "As always with aquariums and zoos, I have mixed feelings, it is beautiful and very interesting, but some animals used to have a lot of space in the wild are put in small \"cages\". I don't regret going, because it was beautiful and fascinating. Most of the species seem to live in",
          "Well worth a visit particularly child friendly. Entry is quite expensive but worth it for the range of display tanks and the quality of the presentation",
          "Go to aquariums in most cities I visit. This one was very good. Quite expensive but worth the money as so much to see. Also had a nice meal at the restaurant there. The only slightly annoying thing was the constant hassling by trinket sellers around the area and even in the",
          "We went on a Saturday should have visited midweek. The Aquarium was fantastic. The beginning with the pregnant Seahorses was spectacular. I've never seen that before. The Jellyfish, were phenomenal. So many kinds with the different lighting colors reflecting through their",
          "I have seen for the first time marine animals of different groups at a single place.Worth seeing by all age groups.the display was nice giving a live experience.Beside sea animals other animals are there.",
          "This acquarium is indeed very big ,second largest in Europe and very varied,From manatees to sharks,dolphins (and a dolphins' nursery),penguins,jellyfish,piranha pythons etc and that is just one part of the acquarium.For an additional price,u can see a variety of birds and lots",
          "Great experience! I was a little sceptical as I was not really a big fan of aquariums. This one is massive and so many things to see. Definitely worth the \u20ac25 we paid.",
          "Spectacular, from the the get down this is an awesome adventure. Stopping after an hour or so for a bite to eat is so worth it. A day at this aquarium is about 2 to 3 hours but soooo worth it It's entertaining, educative n there more than enough places to take lovely pics",
          "It's really a good place where you can seee sharks, dolphins and fishes. it is too expensive for an aquarium.",
          "It's big, it's pretty, is beautiful. Convenient with wheelchair or stroller. The dauphin's tank is huge, offering views from multiple locations. Nice aquarium",
          "Interesting aquarium, but seriously overpriced compared to others much superior in Europe, like Valencia one. Be aware that it can get very crowded.",
          "We have been lucky enough to visit a number of acquariums world wide. US ones are generally good and the one in Sydney, Australia is fantastic. This one is a average at best. It is advertised as the biggest in Europe but doesn't seem that expansive. Other acquariums seem to do",
          "This aquarium is magnificent in the range and beauty of the species. The highlights for us included the dancing dolphins at feeding time (12 noon when we were there), to see them dance together, do summersaults and acrobatics and you see them both underwater and above. Also the",
          "Si, \u00e8 agosto, ma davvero troppa gente nonostante il sito dicesse che non c'era troppa affluenza. La struttura \u00e8 bella, ben tenuta ma se siete gi\u00e0 stati in qualche altro acquario non c'\u00e8 davvero niente di diverso, mi aspettavo di pi\u00f9 date le recensioni. Comunque siamo andati con",
          "We were not disappointed at all, the aquarium is great! A lot of species, a lot of positive emotions. You can see a dolphin show, it is really amazing. Also, we loved sea cows, they are really funny and eat all the time. By the way, they have a discount for students ( 15\u20ac",
          "We've seen a lot of acquariums in Europe, but this one nails all the other ones. From the moment you enter you are getting immersed into the world of water and oceans. Nice collection of fishes and animals. A pleasure for the eyes. Children adore it.",
          "The entrance fee is sizable but I can tell you: it is worth it! You can easily spend have a day in the acquarium. Lot's of fish, small animals and fauna to observe in a beautiful context. Parking in front of the building is very expensive so look for an alternative",
          "Very nice aquarium. Really big and very impressive. Including some touch pools. Dolphins and sharks are very good to see. My kids were exited. Starting early helps to avoid long waiting lines.",
          "This is a big aquarium with lot to see. It will be interesting for kind and adults both. There is a nice cafeteria in the middle of your visit, so if you are tired, you can sit down and relax. This is one of many aquariums that I have visited. It is quite pricey, maybe even not",
          "We were really impressed with this aquarium, it seems that a great deal of thought and time has been spent designing this place to make it easy to wander around at your own pace. Apart from the big shark tank which was good, it had some surprises further on with much bigger",
          "I've been too many aquarium but this was advertised as the biggest in Europe so it was certainly worth a visit with my young daughter during our visit to Genoa. There's something about this place being too big. It has every aspect of sea life. I didn't see a whale (I wouldn't",
          "Just not worth the price. For me it felt uncomfortable that they try to sell you things during your visit, everything costs extra money and you feel exploited.",
          "Fantastic Attraction in Genoa. Especially if you're with some kids, they would be simply amazed to enjoy and see how nice is this Acquarium. Probably is one of the Best in whole Europe. Of course cannot compete with Usa Acquarium, but in any case you can enjoy the attractions",
          "A bit expensive for the time spent inside. The dolphin section was a favourite. Penguins a bit squashed. But through a kids eyes this would not be noticed. Was able to take pretty pics with iPhone.",
          "Went early at 09.00 to avoid the queues as it's a popular attraction. Really enjoyed the aquarium and as a family with teens we moved through it quite quickly. It's all in Italian but there's plenty to look at and the layout is very easy. Not so many interactive things - only",
          "My husband is more of the aquatic lover. But there was quite a lot to see in this aquarium. We just caught the end of the dolphin show, and there were lots of exhibits to see.",
          "Although adults we agreed to viait the aquarium because it was way tooooo hot in Genoa to stay outside.it turned out to be a great ideea because they have there really nicely arranged aquariums with all soets of stories created around the species.yes it is a freat idea while in",
          "A very extensive collection including Dolphins, Seals, Sharks and Manitees as well a diverse fish from all corners of the globe, this aquarium is right on the Marina and well worth a visit. It is quite expensive at 25 euro for an adult but you'll easily spend 2 or 3 hours",
          "Amazing aquarium. It's to see and do. The only place I've ever seen Manatees!! Bought a combined ticket which also gives entrance to the museum del mare and the submarine for \u20ac40.",
          "Go for it .... my big kids wanted to go and we weren't disappointed ... a good trip .... enjoy and don't miss the dolphins and the quiet area for the manatees",
          "We love an aquarium and all agreed this was the best we have visited. There were several animals we have never seen before - manatees were a highlight - and it wasn't too crowded or busy. The cafe was reasonably priced and served good coffee. A very enjoyable visit.",
          "Really enjoyed this aquarium, it's one of the main things to do in Genoa and can easily spend 3 hours in here. Only downside it's \u20ac25, which is way more than I expected. However, as a highlight of Genoa it's probably worth it",
          "Don't miss. Check the time schedule and make sure the all the parts of the museum are open at time of your visit",
          "Escape the heat and visit the underwater world at Acquario di Genova. You'll spend a lovely time learning about ecosystems around the world! Have fun!",
          "We went with our 7 years old son in July and we would recommend it to families with young kids as seeing all that sea life is just amazing (although it was heartbreaking for us adults to see the animals trapped in a museum rather than be in the wildlife!). Some parts of the",
          "My favorite part was the amazing sight of dolphins cause I adore them, but there is a lot more to see, because the spot is hugest I have ever seen",
          "I visited the aquarium with my girlfriend. The ticket is 25\u20ac per person. Aquarium is very nice with a lot of things to see, but i find it a little bit expensive for what they offer. I mention that i didn't catch the dolphin 'show', and maybe that makes a difference. Expect also",
          "A huge and well organized aquarium. It has something for everyone, from create your own fish for their virtual aquarium to incredible dolphins, this place has it all. Sealions, turtles, piranha, you name it it's there. I didn't know there were jellyfish as small as pencil",
          "The largest aquarium in Europe with some brilliant exhibits - saw manatees for the first time - touch area, examples of fish from across the world. An absolute must if visiting Genoa but can get very busy, in the Summer it is open very late and a visit at say 6.00 would avoid",
          "Been here several times it is a good size and plenty to see and do the dolphins in particular are amazing I love to spend time watching them the scenery around the center is amazing also",
          "My husband and I visited the acquario and absolutely loved it. It is very big, interesting, there are activities for children, there is a pet pool there which is very cool and I haven't seen something like this anywhere.",
          "Superb aquarium, quite high price however excellent in all aspects. Many types of fish and other animals. Would recommend to all visitors of Genova.",
          "I have been to many aquariums worldwide. top of my personal list ist definitely Genova and Sydney, Australia. From location, size and design Genova is unique and the must see place in this beautiful city. highly recommended!",
          "At 50 Euros between us, my wife & I expected much of this attraction, and I cannot understand how so many people rate it so highly, as it was truly the lowest point of our trip around Northern Italy by a long way. It may have been because we entered it at 7.45pm although it says",
          "The best place with sea animal i have ever been!!! Everything is spectacular, great organisation, splendid plants and sea animals. Best place for children to see rare fish closure. The dolphins area is wonderfull... peace... quiet... blue... harmony!!!",
          "We have been to a few aquariums, but this beats them all. A great experience. Go late afternoon/early evening to avoid the crowds, and be prepared to walk!",
          "After reading reviews - decided that we have to see it, despite our home town Chicago has its own famous Shed Aquarium. We were not disappointed. Be prepared - it's huge - so plan to spend 3-4 hours at least, to see all it has at the leisure pace. There is strategically placed",
          "Great place for children (and their parents as well). We took a bundle Aquarium + Galata Museum + Submarine, and spent there about the full day. All of those were interesting. Expect at least half an hour for touching a stingray in the Aquarium :) Hint \u2013 there is a tangible",
          "It's not safe for tourist to park and be around the area because of trick beggars. The touch the fish part was awful with very few fish for the kids to touch. A very expensive place for an average experience. Important notice: Do NOT accept anything \"free\" from the beggars. They",
          "Very cool place! I believe it's a must when visiting Genoa. It not only gives you a great look at Italy's biggest aquarium, but a great view of Genoa from its glass windows. A place for the young and old!",
          "Definitely go!! Absolutely stunning and well organised, so much to see, you'll easily spend 2 hours there!",
          "Great place to spend about 4 hours or so - you can buy your tickets online but you still need to go to an office to validate them before entry which is a bit of a waste of time and there are no rules when it comes to forming a queue in Italy. Lovely aquarium and the dolphin show",
          "You have the opportunity to see different sea species like starfish wine color and very tiny jellyfish.",
          "For the price of EUR 25 (also for youngsters above 12 years) and its reputation, I would have expected a bit more. But it is interesting especially the pools with the delfins and the pinguins.",
          "This is the best aquarium we have visited. The architecture and multilevel display areas are fantastic because you never really know what's coming next. The sheer variety of sea life is great and kept us and our 3 year old daughter enthralled. In fact I have rarely seen her so",
          "It was good but not great. Lots of fish but it lacked bigger sharks. No audio guide. You often had the feeling that the fish were suffering from enclosure induced stress. Heart breaking to see some creatures banged up like that.",
          "Beautiful in so many ways! Loads of different fishes, colourful, interesting and useful to learn more about what is going on under the sea level. Feeding time was a blast!! Take cash with you and have a great time alone or with kids. Could be better information on english, so",
          "The layout of the aquarium is nicely done. The exhibits aren't too crowded together. The tanks for the larger mammals and the tropical reef are viewed twice along the exhibit route, once from the side and once from above. There is a nicely done exhibit on naturalists and",
          "We're from Vancouver, and have also visited the Monterey aquarium and many others, so have pretty high expectations for aquariums. This one was good but not outstanding. I was happy with the amount to see, as adults visiting without children. Lots of sea horses and fish of",
          "The first time I visit it was my first time in Genoa also so I was visiting all main attractions. I like it a lot and enjoyed the visit despite it was really crowded in there and people went on taking pictures with flash (it really bothers me) which is not allow because it's not",
          "Visited purely by chance to get out the heat of the day, what a fantastic place , its seemingly the largest of its kind in Europe, go visit it, you can lose yourself for hours here :)",
          "absolutely loved the visit, exotic fish unique aquarium and a wide variety of sea creatures, many which i've never even seen before! would go for it again and again..",
          "very interesting and always evolving with novelties. Scientifically very sound and very good entertainment.",
          "We travel with kids (10 and 8 now) and always try to visit the aquarium for a day out of the sun and some biology education. Plus, we like the fish : ). I sort of expected more from this aquarium given its size. It was nice, and is very large, but the tanks were a little",
          "This is a good aquarium, and it entertained the kids. Our hotel (best western) sold discounted tickets so look into that. Personally I would not visit the aquarium again if you have been to monterey, san diego, tampa bay, etc... this is no where near as good. I wish I had",
          "Even if it is not the best Acquario I have ever seen, it is worth a visit. You will find almost every type of fish and aquatic mammal inside. The best part was to see the dolphins jump right next to me!",
          "A Renzo Piano designed aquarium right in the old seaside of Genoa. The modern structure fitting in seamlessly with the seaport of Christopher Columbus! I have seen many aquariums in the states but this was monumentally different. You can view the fish from above and below and",
          "When I told a friend I was going to Italy with my son he promptly ordered: \"you must go see Genoa Acquarium!\". Oh well, we were not going to the city, but ... we did a leap of faith on his behalf. We paied 50 euro for 2 adults and a 3 year old child. And in the end ... it was",
          "Its the biggest in Italy, but the whole area is not really big. It has nice collection of marine animals but nothing you cannot see anywhere else. There are also plants, turtle etc in the exitbition. If you are tourist from Asia and USA, most likely you find other aquariums are",
          "We went here on a Sunday around noon and only 5 people were in line. Got in right away and it was not very crowded. Maybe because it was almost lunch time. Besides seeing the aquarium from the paid \u20ac25 ticket. We also took the chance to go behind the scene for an extra \u20ac8. They",
          "Entrance is not cheap, but worth every penny. You can easily spend 2 hours here seeing various see animals and fauna.",
          "I have seen various big Aquariums in Europe in my life, this is certainly one of the best. Had a great visit, enjoyed the setting and the experience. Do it.",
          "Hearing this was \"largest in Europe\" raises hopes. It's ok, but nothing special. If you are from North America and have visited Atlanta or Toronto or Monterrey, don't expect more. Rainy day attraction.",
          "Well organized the online ticket purchase (we skipped the main cue). All the visit is nicely organized.",
          "I have visited many aquariums around the world but this one is definitely the best one I have ever seen! Rated 9th worldwide, it should be closer to the top due to the brilliance of its displays of exotic fish, manta rays, sharks, dolphins, and all other types of fish, etc.",
          "Firstly this place is costly- luckily our boy is only 3 so he got in free, but EURO 50+ is on the high side - but we thought it would be worth it. Unfortunately not..... there is nothing wrong with the aquarium, but also nothing special either, as others have mentioned. Despite",
          "Every corner of the world was represented at this aquarium. Enjoyed the Antarctica portion as well as the tropical areas. Beautifully done exhibits with a hands on area where you can touch the rays.",
          "We went here because it is the biggest aquarium in Italy. I have been to many aquariums and unfortunately I was disappointed. We still enjoyed ourselves walking around seeing the different species and learned a couple things in the process. In my opinion there was nothing that",
          "Absolutely loved the aquarium! It is very impressive, lots to see, informative, well designed and laid out. The dolphins were a real highlight, especially at feeding time.",
          "Closed bathroom and dirty place by near a great place to walk.also too . You can go to a lot of restaurant near",
          "Great aquarium with loads to see. Huge underwater viewing area of dolphin pool. Our baby loved it. It does get pretty crowded.",
          "Visited this on a rainy day (perfect) and on my own, and took about 1 1/2 hours to go round and see everything, though I suspect with children in tow you could spend a lot longer. There are all sorts of games they can play and lots to see and do. Would have given it 5 stars",
          "There is nothing else to say than amazing. Aquarium shows a lot of animals that you couldn't see anywhere else, dolphins and jellyfish win for me. I could spend there hours. The only thing missing here was bench at each aquarium so you could just sit and observe. 6/5!",
          "Lots to see from all over the world. Cost was 25 Euro per adult. After you have enter the exhibition you are asked to have you photo taken. Don't be alarmed as you can buy the photo at the end. The directions are straight forward with the supplied map and there are plenty of",
          "My wife and I visited this Aquarium while in Genoa, it is a large site, nice in its layout, can easily accommodate large groups. Note, in summer, the Aquarium could get rather hot as there is no air conditioning. Exhibits are spaced out, and the garden tanks, coral etc, are just",
          "Many animals! I give only 4 stars because sometimes its unclear which fish is what. But the Dolphins are really cute :)",
          "The place is amazing. You can see lots of fish and rare species. It's a great experience even for the \u00e1rulta. It's lovely how close you can be to the animals.",
          "With fairly long queues we decide to join and visit This is easily the most amazing aquarium I have visited 100s of interesting species and a great look into the past, present and future Excellent facilities throughout Well worth the entrance fee",
          "It's a shame we didn't read the reviews before going to this place. Although the visitors are supposed to be let inside every 30 min to avoid overcrowding, it was a mess. As many others noted, it is quite hot inside. Despite the great variety of species, most tanks were quite",
          "Located near the Old port of Genoa. Many collection are there though nothing special. High entrance fee.",
          "Non-conditioned air inside the whole aquarium ruins all the impression. The staff which allows people to enter the facility is not well organised, routes inside the aquarium were not well prepared - there was definitely some way open which shouldn't so at some point it was",
          "Very good visit in this aquarium for a 25\u20ac fee (more expensive than the Louvre or the Hermitage museums for instance...) + some activities necessitate a separate additional cost. Quite a bit of variety in the species that are present.",
          "Lots of friends told this is a must, and indeed it is. But I expected more. it was overcrowded, hot and the overall settings were not remarkably appealing. Good but not excellent, even though it is Europe's biggest. If you go, you have to book online well in advance. Try to",
          "First off you have to wait in a huge line for tickets unless you get there early. Then you have to wait for your time to go in (ours was 2 hours after purchasing tickets). Finally once you were in it was massively crowded, you couldn't see anything and were tripping over",
          "Coming from San Francisco, where we have two large aquarium, not to mention the Monterey Bay Aquarium nearby, I would have to compare it to something of a hybrid between the Steinhart and Monterey Bay aquariums. Lots of planned things for kids to do. Penguins were fun to watch.",
          "Yes, I held this particular stop over my kids' heads for days, anytime they seemed to need a reward for good behavior. But in the end, I think I enjoyed it as much as they did. Our highlight was the dolphins. They view of the harbor and hillsides was amazing, and it was such a",
          "Unfortunately the beauty of the content doesn't make up for the mess and disorganization. Needless to say that the aquarium is fantastic, well conceived and thought through. But that's about it. The mess at the entrance for ticketing, the mess inside to get around makes you",
          "The aquarium was fantastic, definitely worth a visit. Takes about three hours. The ticket we purchased included the biosphere and the Antarctic museum, however the Antarctic museum was closed when we went after the aquarium, as last entry was 12:00 on Saturday and this wasn't",
          "Fish tanks are huge and amazing as always. Try to get to dolphin feeding show, they are awesome and very well trained.",

          "We went to this aquarium so that our three year old boy could see all the fish hel loves and discover new ones. This aquarium is huge! It has tanks full of sharks, others with dolphins and still others with penguins! It has all types of fish and some other marine animals, the",
          "This is a very BIG aquarium, with lots of fish and other marine animals (dolphins, sharks, seals, penguins, etc) If you have been to other aquariums - this one is nothing too special. Its a nice stop, maybe a bit expensive at 25 euros, but we still had a good time walking",
          "Makes a Visit to Genoa worth it if you're unsure! A massive range of fish and other animals, would definitely come back!",
          "We bought our tickets online - which seemed a really good idea when we saw how busy it was - but then had to go through 3 different queues to have our tickets (turned out they were vouchers and not tickets!) converted to tickets. You need to find the \"office entrance\"! Once",
          "This is the second biggest aquarium in Europe and deserves a couple of hours of anyone's time. If you've visited similar places, it's not particularly original, but it's well designed and contains a huge variety of sea life. Highly recommended.",
          "Wonderful place! Went there together with my family in occasion of my father 60th Anniversary and I completely hit the target with this idea! Place is very well organized, with a good guidance which ensures you don't get \"lost\" and miss \"hidden\" sections! Since the last time I",
          "I like aquariums, they are peaceful and colourful and this one is no different. It is also nicely situated in the Port near other attractions.",
          "Spent 3.5 hrs in this super aquarium for only 25\u20ac each. The best and largest exhibits of living coral I have seen...ethically grown, not taken from the wild...and associated beautiful fish. Dolphins on exhibit in outside pools...no side show acts. Signage is available in English",
          "The largest probably... Diverse absolutely not.... There are far better aquarium around and if you have seen some or even one you could easily skip it... The best part is the one with dolphins.... The rest of it is extremely basic.... While it can be something for children... I",
          "We came to Genoa specially to visit the aquarium, considering it's the largest one in Europe, we expected quite something. However, when we arrived the tickets were very expensive and the trip was surprisingly short. The Penguins on the other hand looked great and were a thrill.",
          "This is an incredible place. A huge aquarium, I think the largest in Europe. A great deal of thought has gone into planning the displays, some of which show the fish on different levels. There really is something for all age groups. It will take a couple of hours to see",
          "We went on a Sunday and it was full [and I mean full] of familes. This made it a little difficulty to see things properly as all the children naturallt wanted to press their noses up against the glass. It was also rather noisy to say the least. Apart form that, we did enjoy",
          "Too Many people, too much noise, if you have been to another aquarium before,I don't recommend you visiting it.",
          "It was a nice thing to do in a windy and cloudy day. You need at least 3 hrs to visit the basic package. A bit expensive for what they offer and on weekends is full of kids so you can't really enjoy making a nice photo.",
          "Great to visit aquarium if the weather is not so nice, u need 3 hrs at least, specially if u get stuck in front of the dolphines\ud83d\ude01 they have great show,worth waiting for.",
          "I wanted to visit the Aquarium because I red that it is the largest one in the Europe. But I was very disappointed. It is not so big as I imagine. I should say it is beautiful Aquarium, but the price is too high for this.",
          "Was here about 20 years ago and was impressed then. Now its even better. Tip: take your time and read the info on display.",
          "We liked so much this place, it's wonderful, perfect for children and interesting for adults. You're going to love it for sure !",
          "The acquarium itself is really big, there are many different sections with sealife, on Friday there were many school trips and sometimes was quite crowded and noisy but it's a definitely a place to visit in Genoa. If only the price was a bit lower...",
          "A nice collection of sea creatures. They did a good job creating their natural habitats. Our 4 yr old really enjoyed all the fish, and so did we. The only minus is the location or better the lack of parking spaces esp. for larger cars.",
          "Although it is not the cheapest It was amazing! I personally reccomend to go outside high season to experience proximity to animals.",
          "Loved this place, so well taken care off and please do not miss the manta rays are where you can actually touch them, OMG amazing loved it",
          "The Aquarium is large and houses a variety of creatures however the price is steep. It is part of a large area with plenty to see and do, a good way to spend a day.",
          "I visited here during a one day stay in Genoa and thoroughly eNjoyed it. The displays are very well done and the big fish tanks (sharks, porpoises, etc) are stunning. The sea front area where it is located is also close to the Galata maritime museum which is also definitely",

          "Ferrari square is not named after the most famous Ferrari in the world - Enzo. It is named after Raffaele De Ferrari, the banker who financed the reconstruction of the port of Genoa in the nineteenth century. I suspect that the majority of Italians doesn't know anything about",

          "This is one of my favorite piazzas in Italy, and I like piazzas a lot. Perhaps it is the maze of twisting little streets that open up on this large plaza with the gigantic fountain that enhances the perception, but you'll want to stop and drink it in, perhaps with an espresso.",
          "This plaza is great for photos. Street off to the side via Settembre has great shopping (for my wife) and a couple of good coffee shops. Seems safer than some of other side streets.",

          "We went to the center of Genova for shopping at the \"Via XX Settembre\" and then saw this nice fountain. If you are in the neighborhood I would recommend to stop by and have a look at the fountain and the surrounding buildings. But maybe this is not worth the while to make an",

          "We walked here from the port, but it wasn't really worth it. I was hoping there would be good restaurants on the piazza, but there wasn't anything like that. Luckily we found a great one nearby called Santa Therese. At least the architecture in the piazza is interesting.",
          "Piazza Raffaele De Ferrari is in the centre on Genoa very close to the famous Strada Nuova. The fountain is in the middle of it. On the warm sunny day the fountain and the square itself look very cosy and relaxing. Teatro Carlo Felice , the principal opera house of Genova, is",

          "What a beautiful site. It's a beautiful fountain in the middle of Genoa that has a calming effect after a long days walk through the city. They've added some kind of blue colourant to the water as if trying to enhance its appearance. I feel this is odd and it spoils the natural",
          "This was one of the places we visited more than once, just to take a break and sit and relax while on our walk through this gorgeous city. It was exceptionally clean and litter free. Specially due to the fact that so many travelllers visited here.",

        "wiki": "Via Giuseppe Garibaldi is a street in the historical centre of Genoa, in Northwestern Italy, well known for its ancient palaces. It is one of the Strade Nuove (Italian for \"new streets\") built by the Genoese aristocracy during the Renaissance. Since July 2006 it is inscribed in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Site Genoa: the Strade Nuove and the system of the Palazzi dei Rolli.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe street, sanctioned in 1550, was built in 1558-1583. Originally named Strada Maggiore or Strada Nuova, in 1882 it was dedicated to Giuseppe Garibaldi. The street is 250 metres long and 7.5 metres wide.\nBetween the first half of the 16th century and the first half of the 17th century, the nobility of the Republic of Genoa started a careful town planning to transform the existing medieval city and initiate a sizeable urban expansion to the North. The move to expand the antique palaces and to build new sumptuous ones was driven by the extraordinary wealth that came into the city through prosperous financing activities towards several European powers. In particular, the Genoese aristocracy financed the expensive undertakings of the Spanish Crown, such as the mercenary army that Spain kept in Flanders from 1566 to the peace of Westphalia in 1648. The ruling class of Genoa, mixing nobility of blood with new mercantile wealth, sought to underpin their prestige by the construction of grand city palaces and suburban villas of unusual splendor.\n\n\n== Palaces listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site ==\n\n\n== In literature ==\nCharles Dickens gave a suggestive description of Strada Nuova in his travelogue Pictures from Italy.\n...When shall I forget the Streets of Palaces: the Strada Nuova and the Strada Balbi! or how the former looked one summer day, when I first saw it underneath the brightest and most intensely blue of summer skies: which its narrow perspective of immense mansions, reduced to a tapering and most precious strip of brightness, looking down upon the heavy shade below! The endless details of these rich Palaces: the walls of some of them, within, alive with masterpieces by Vandyke! The great, heavy, stone balconies, one above another, and tier over tier: with here and there, one larger than the rest, towering high up\u2014a huge marble platform; the doorless vestibules, massively barred lower windows, immense public staircases, thick marble pillars, strong dungeon-like arches, and dreary, dreaming, echoing vaulted chambers: among which the eye wanders again, and again, and again, as every palace is succeeded by another- the terrace gardens between house and house, with green arches of the vine, and groves of orange-trees, and blushing oleander in full bloom, twenty, thirty, forty feet above the street\u2014the painted halls, mouldering, and blotting, and rotting in the damp corners, and still shining out in beautiful colours and voluptuous designs...\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nFiorella Caraceni (1992), Una strada rinascimentale: via Garibaldi a Genova, Genova, SAGEP\nGiorgio Doria (1995), Nobilt\u00e0 e investimenti a Genova in Et\u00e0 moderna, Genova\nGioconda Pomella (2007), Guida Completa ai Palazzi dei Rolli Genova, Genova, De Ferrari Editore(ISBN 9788871728155)\nMauro Quercioli (2008), I Palazzi dei Rolli di Genova, Roma, Libreria dello Stato (ISBN 9788824011433)\nFiorella Caraceni Poleggi (2001), Palazzi Antichi e Moderni di Genova raccolti e disegnati da Pietro Paolo Rubens (1652), Genova, Tormena Editore (ISBN 9788884801302)\nMario Lab\u00f2 (2003), I palazzi di Genova di P.P.

          "The entire city is the best kept secret in Europe, I visited in April 2008. Via Garibaldi is such a romantic street: the cobblestone, the musicians playing, the quaint little shops, etc. My hotel, The Best Western, was right off of V.G. and I had a faboulous time. Shuttles",
          "It's definatly something to see while in Genova. The palaces are nice. I didnt go into any of the museums. After walking the road west to east, go north for the gothic-renaissance church (black&white)."

        "wiki": "Genoa Cathedral (Italian: Duomo di Genova, Cattedrale di San Lorenzo) is a Roman Catholic cathedral in the Italian city of Genoa. It is dedicated to Saint Lawrence (San Lorenzo), and is the seat of the Archbishop of Genoa. The cathedral was consecrated by Pope Gelasius II in 1118 and was built between the twelfth century and the fourteenth century as fundamentally a medieval building, with some later additions. Secondary naves and side covers are of Romanesque style and the main facade is Gothic from the early thirteenth century, while capitals and columns with interior corridors date from the early fourteenth century. The bell tower and dome were built in the sixteenth century.\n\n\n== History ==\nExcavations under the pavement and in the area in front of today's west front have brought to light walls and pavements of Roman age as well as pre-Christian sarcophagi, suggesting the existence of a burial ground in the site. Later a church devoted to the Twelve Apostles was built, which was in turn flanked and replaced by a new cathedral dedicated to Saint Lawrence, in Romanesque style. Money came from the successful enterprises of the Genoese fleets in the Crusades.\nThe first cathedral, now the basilica of St. Syrus, was founded probably in the 5th or 6th century AD, devoted to Saint Sirus, bishop of Genoa. The transferring of the cathedral favored the urbanization of the zone that, with the construction of its walls in 1155, and the fusion of the three ancient city nuclei (castrum, civitas and burgus), became the heart of the city. The piazza, in the absence of other public squares and centers of lay power, was the city's only public space for the whole of the Middle Ages. The cathedral was consecrated by Pope Gelasius II in 1118, and from 1133 had archiepiscopal rank. After the fire of 1296, provoked by fights between Guelphs and Ghibellines, the building was partly restored and partly rebuilt. Between 1307 and 1312 the fa\u00e7ade was completed, the inner colonnades rebuilt with capitals and matronei added. The Romanesque structures remained pretty untouched, and frescoes of religious subject were also added.\nVarious altars and chapels have been erected between the 14th and 15th centuries. The small loggia on the north-eastern tower of the fa\u00e7ade was built in 1455; the opposite one, in Mannerist style, is from 1522. In 1550 the Perugian architect Galeazzo Alessi was commissioned by the city magistrates to plan the reconstruction of the entire building; however, he executed only the covering of the nave and aisles, the pavement, the dome and the apse.\nThe construction of the cathedral finished in the 17th century. The dome and the medieval parts were restored in 1894-1900. The present 7 bells are tuned in the major scale of C#.\nAmong the artworks inside the church are ceiling frescoes in a chapel on the north by Luca Cambiaso; a Crucifixion with Saints (St. Sebastian's Vision) by Barocci; in front of the organ is an Episode from the life of St. Lawrence by Giovanni Andrea Ansaldo; the ceiling fresco in the presbytery of the Martyrdom of St Lawrence was painted by  Lazzaro Tavarone; and an Assumption of the Virgin (1914) by Gaetano Previati. The church also contains 14th-century frescoes in the Byzantine style in the main portal.\nSculptural works include a statue in the chapel of St. John by  Domenico Gagini ; a Virgin and a St. John the Baptist  by Andrea Sansovino. Other works include works by  Matteo Civitali, Taddeo Carlone,and Giacomo and Guglielmo Della Porta .\nThe Museum of the Treasury lies under the cathedral and holds a collection of jewellery and silverware from 9 AD up to the present. Among the most important pieces are the sacred bowl (it:Sacro Catino) brought by Guglielmo Embriaco after the conquest of Caesarea and supposed to be the chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper; and the Cassa Processionale del Corpus Domini.\n\n\n=== War damage ===\n\nThe cathedral had a fortunate escape on February 9, 1941, when the city was being shelled as part of Operation Grog. Because of a crew error, the British battleship HMS Malaya fired a 381 mm (15.0 in) armour-piercing shell into the south-eastern corner of the nave. The relatively soft material failed to detonate the fuse and the shell is still there.The inscription, which gives thanks for the cathedral's escape reads: \nQUESTA BOMBA LANCIATA DALLA FLOTTA INGLESE PUR SFONDANDO LE PARETI DI QUESTA INSIGNE CATTEDRALE QUI CADEVA INESPLOSA IL IX FEBBRAIO MCMXLI  \nA RICONOSCENZA PERENNE GENOVA CITT\u00c0 DI MARIA VOLLE INCISA IN PIETRA LA MEMORIA DI TANTA GRAZIA  (This bomb, launched by the British Navy, though breaking through the walls of this great cathedral, fell here unexploded on February 9, 1941. In perpetual gratitude, Genoa, the City of Mary, desired to engrave in stone, the memory of such grace.)\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of cathedrals\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Genoa\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPadovano, Aldo; Felice Volpe (2008).

          "After living here for 3 years I finally went up the tower to get a view of the city. The view is only so-so because of buildings blocking the way. Also, you cannot actually go to the very top since it is blocked off. The 5 Euro admission price is is too high for this",

          "Of course the Duomo looks god from the outside with the classic stripes, but the inside it disappointing. Firstly, there is restoration going on so you can't see the ceilings, and secondly and more importantly, you can only stand just inside at the entrance and look in you",

          "If you don't want to or can't, walk upstairs, ignore the front magnificent entrance and carry on round to the side entrance which is up a slight ramp. The church is ornate outside but inside it has painted religious ceilings and the side chapels are good too. Check out the",
          "I was not even looking for it, I had no map, I just walked around and found it, breathtaking, definitly worth it, I'm not catholic but I still appreciate the efforts in design and architecture put into all these historical churches",
          "We went into the church at the end of a Saturday mass, so were happy to see the beauty of this historical building. It's atmosfere is unique, especially the medivial sculptures and the side altars.",
          "Impossible to be miss coming up from the Genova Harbout toward the Centro Storico. The magnificient structure is towering most of the surrounding streets anyway, so is hard to miss. Interiors are worthy a visit as well, but please remember is a Church, so no beachwears or silly",
          "Visited here on the way to a local restaurant, was nice to see this and the square with relatively no tourists about. Very nice architecture and nice to have a wander around.",
          "This is a beautiful church. The outside has much to be admired as does the inside. And we especially liked that inside there was not as much gold as in some of the other churches we have visited.",
          "The decoration inside the church is spectacular. There is a dress code for entry but at the side door ladies can borrow a wrap if required.",
          "nice hidden sqaure and momental cathedral, by a portion of focaccia, something to drink and enjoy every single detail",
          "The building is well worth a visit - the interior is a mixture of medieval and baroque styles, with magnificent architecture. There is also an unexploded bomb from WWII on display - a reminder that Genoa was an important military target at the time.",
          "This place is just stunning to look at - one of the finest in northern Italy outside of the major city sites. It's a shame you can't see it from further away but head towards it, stand in the front square and admire the architecture, colour, and design - you won't be",
          "This is the first site ot attraction we have seen when came to Genoa. It made us happy to be here and we were ready to explore more o the city. But this is more or less all you have to see there. Appart from ugly, dirty, strange streets when you are going towards the old harbour",
          "On one of the main squares, this is a really impressive church. It is the size and the symmetry that are special.",
          "Only front side of cathedral look pretty nice other sides are devastated, cathedral is very big and from inside look like any other cathedral.",
          "We popped in here as we were wandering the area. It was quiet, cool, and lovely. If I return to Genova, I will visit here again and stay longer.",
          "This is a wonderful and impressive sight. A summer visit means long lines that can be helped a bit by pre-buying tickets. My daughter and I like to use audio guides when we can and the Duomo guide was disappointing. There was very little background provided, mostly just names",
          "Whenever some selfmade church-official is telling one female she should wear clothes covering legs and shoulders and lets another walk in in super-shorts, Jezus will roll-over in his grave. Nice building but completely run over. Stupid the entry and exit were allowed through te",
          "Typical of Genovese style with the grey and white layers of marble and stone, intricate carvings and examples of various architectural styles as the church was built over the years. Beautiful inside, definitely worth a stop.",
          "Very impressive from the outside and from the inside. Located in a small square it's size dominates the center of town",
          "Stunning and well worth the visit... Loved the \"unexploded\" British WWII bomb in the main area... Nice touch : )",
          "I visited this place with my colleague from Latvia. The structure itself says the story and its beautiful. Its well built and looks awesome. My friend told me some history about it. Many a times during my visit to piazz de ferrare or Piazz dele erbe i passed through this church.",
          "Like many Italian towns this duomo is an important part of history and life. This one is not exception. The museum is closed on a Sunday, unlike others which are closed on a Monday.",
          "My family and I spent a day in Genoa and this was one of the first things we stumbled upon while walking around the city. It's a tucked away beauty; I loved taking photos of the exterior, however they didn't let us girls in because of our clothes. If you want to see the inside",
          "This was closed when we arrived but we did get some very good photos of the building which has a very interesting style and is in a nice area.",
          "Beautiful Cathedral! We attended mass there. It is centrally located near beautiful streets, restaurants, and lots of shops.",
          "we managed to sneak in even though supposedly shut. Not as impressive as some but worth a quick visit. The outside is very attractive though and you do sort of just come across it when wandering streets of Genoa",
          "The overall experience of the architecture and art is a sensory experience. The Matteo Civitali sculptures in a side chapel are well worth the search. Civitali was a late 15th century master from Lucca who is not well known outside of artist and scholars circles.",
          "The Cattedrale is a must for anyone coming to Genoa. A little bit hidden in the narrow streets of the centre. Be aware of the \"lunch break\". It closes between 12:30 and 14:00.",
          "This Cathedral is compact.It has beautifully painted ceiling and has some lovely paintings on the wall. It is now undergoing refurbishment, near the Altar.It has a nice facade, almost neoclassical. Worth a visit.",
          "Nice cathedral with free entry and worth a quick visit whilst in Genoa. Not much more to say really...................",
          "We saw a LOT of cathedrals, churches, enthralling buildings and scenery of every sort. But this was a standout. Even the kids were impressed and their attention was held for the length of our visit.",
          "We loved this church! One of our favorites with the wicked awesome black and white marble throughout. Also right near a nice shopping strip and tons of delicious restaurants. We sat on the steps for a bit eating gelato and highly enjoyed a local band playing some traditional",
          "We only had a morning to spend in Genoa, but managed to see this cathedral. It is grand and imposing from the outside, with impressive scale and detail. Inside is lovely - make sure that shoulders are covered and shorts reach your knees. Wish we'd had more time. Highly recommend.",
          "I just got a kick of the fact that they kept the bomb form WWII in one of the corners of the church. Lovely as all churches but as all of them, what a waist of resources.",
          "Beautiful Cathedral in a small square which was smaller but it was amplified a couple of centuries ago. Very beautiful inside too.",
          "Late 11th century Cathedral, with lovely lion sculptures guarding the front. The Chapel of Saint John the Baptist, built 15th century is beautiful.",
          "I stopped by St. Lorenzo by accidently, however I never seen the white & grey marble used inside & outside before! It's a great designed church, beautiful windows, detailed sculptures, main gates & the lion's sculptures. Must see when you visit in Genoa!",
          "Old and beautiful. Exceptional example of Italian architecture. Decorated with beautiful paintings. Can't miss it if u visit Genova",
          "We had the luck of staying in a flat overlooking the cathedral di San Lorenzo, so I spent much of our trip looking at it, sitting on its steps, or walking in its shadow. Such beauty! And the inside is truly breathtaking. One of my favorite things about this cathedral is that",
          "The black and white of this building showed it was valued. The entrance in itself is well worth a view.",
          "Beside the gorgeous architecture, the duomo has many \"hidden\" features that worth a visit. First of all \"il santo catino\" the holy basin which was believed used by Jesus during the last supper and sometimes believed to be the holy grail. Then, as a very interesting search, look",
          "It reminds a lot Santa Maria Novella (colors, style) but to my opinion (and I am far away to be an expert ..don't get me wrong) it's much nicer this one. Less crowded, more intimate and amazing details. The main door is spectacular",
          "The cathedral is really beautiful mixture of 14th and 15th century interiors that is much restored and is currently partially obscured by what looked like permanent scaffolding. There are a number of illustrated information sheets around the building but sadly my italian is not",
          "Our family attended Good Friday mass here recently. It was a great experience for my wife. The interior is classic amazing Italian Church!",
          "For those who love to enjoy the works of Catholicism, like me, this cathedral is eye popping, it is dated 1098 (ancient!) And houses inside the ashes of St. John the Baptist (the patron saint of Genoa). The same was consecrated by Pope Gelasius II in 1118, after nearly 200 years",
          "One of many nice churches worth visiting in Genoa. This is one of two main ones with the medieval white/black horizontal striped masonry that was used in years 1100-1300; this one having better architecture and is much more interesting. Free to enter and look around, this",
          "Incredibly different outside architecture and inside fullfilled cathedral, a definite 'must visit' when in Genoa!",
          "The cathedral is built of alternate layers of Carrara marble and local slate, facing into Piazza San Lorenzo, and with Via San Lorenzo running alongside. Lots of little cafes, shops, market stalls etc, leading down to the port. Some beautiful decoration inside. Locals use the",
          "Visited this cathedral in January - very beautiful architecture and cozy atmosphere in the square. Cathedral looks from the inside as well - it's always free so worth going.",
          "We came upon this Cathedral on our first night out in Genova, it sits in the heart of the medical district and a very unexpected surprise as we rounded a corner to fine this amazing building in front of us. We returned to next day to see inside very beautiful and a definite",
          "There is a shell inside this church which was shooted from a crouser during second world war. Good quest to find it.",
          "After a walk in porto antico go to the duomo.Inside take a ticket of 6.5 euros and visit the treasures of the duomo.We found a treasure there.There was a golden cross containing small wood parts of the ACTUALL CROSS OF CRIST.i think there is nothing like this in all Vatican.",
          "We arrived just before Christmas and the place had a film crew etc all around so we could go in, but it was easy to admire the beautiful architecture and different coloured stone used here..quite unusual.",
          "Got to the outside of this building and the doors was close as if saying stay out. Was not sure if it is safe to enter or not. The lion statue outside had a sad face so that says a lot. We decided not to go in.",
          "The design of this cathedral is one of its kind. I haven't been inside but it clearly stands out as one of the most creatively designed I have ever seen.",
          "Really beautiful cathedral. G\u00e9nova is full with little streets and se thought it was lovely how just walking around you could discover beautiful sights such as this one. Just one thing, they have formal dressing code in case you want to entre the church.",
          "You need to be aware that the churches and Cathederal are kinky open during certain hours. Normally late afternoon to early evening. San Lorenzo is just breathtaking, wonderful architecture and typical Genova style. A must visit.",
          "Nice church, centrally located. Probably not my favourite church in Genova, but also worth seeing. Always some fun going on outside the church.",
          "I went to the Cathedral, like many others, to see the spectacular architecture of the interior, which is nice and distinct, especially due to the arches in the middle. What I also recommend is to go the museum and see the church artifacts, among them ashes from John the baptist",
          "I saw the cathedral at night and was impressed at the architecture and of course the sad lions on each side of the entrance. Inside is a massive display of deity and artifacts and most importantly a place to pray.",
          "Well worth a visit and you can go in as a tourist even when Mass is being said. Just be silent! Very unusual architecture - unlike most cathedrals I've been in. It's on the street up to the Ferrari metro and piazza from the old port area.",
          "Well worth a visit - interesting inside and out. Try to go when there is a service as the singing by the choir is fantastic",
          "This is a very impressive building to view, and, unlike many churches in Italian cities, open yo visitors most of the time and free to get into. Unfortunately, when you get in you find that most of the interior is railed off, except during services, and you can only go round a",
          "A nice cathedral both outside and inside wise. You can enjoy sitting outside on the stairs or visit the church itself. It is also amazing for photography. There is not entrance fee.",
          "Walking through the old city section of Genoa we were struck by the view of the Cathedral Di San Lorenzo. It is designed with alternating black and white stone giving it an austere, yet regal look. The entrance is grand with a huge flight of stairs flanked on each side by",
          "A beautiful black and white marble church in a charming square in the old part of Genova. The city is full of historic churches and piazzas but I just loved the outside of this one. Not as stunning as Siena but definitely worth a look.",
          "Great gothic example in north italy, its magnificiency spreads at the top of narrow streets walking along from ancient harbour",
          "Beautiful old cathedral with interesting paintings, stained glass and chapels within. Elegant styling well worth a visit.",
          "During our stay in Genoa we visited the beautiful black and white striped Cathedral di San Lorenzo (Saint Lawrence), which is guard by two lions. The Cathedral dates back to the 5th Century because underneath the church old Roman walls have been found. The first Christians built",
          "Absolutely must-visit place in Genoa - gives a good understanding of what is Italian church architecture.",
          "A stunning stripy facade and my favourite bit was the lion sculptures at the entrance. We were bemused by its expressive face and tail curled up between its legs - very unique. A good piazza to admire the splendour of Genova.",
          "The day we arrived in Genoa there was a major Holy parade with hundreds of people and clergy marching towards the Duomo. Music was playing on loud speakers. We followed the marchers to the Duomo. It looked like a place for us to visit later and we did. It was very pretty on the",
          "This was disappointing. The facade was great and the guide book raved about the interior, but I can't comment, as tourists were penned into the rear 5 yards of the church. We couldn't even pray. And no, there was no service in progress, we just weren't welcome. Not a very",
          "We stopped here on a shore excursion into Genoa. It's a unique structure with the black and white striped stones. The inside was beautiful as well. They do supply wraps for legs or shoulders if you didn't come prepared and wish to go inside.",
          "Impressive and monumental building with outstanding and imposing architecture and decorations inside and out. The main Cathedral in Genoa well worth a visit.",
          "Interesting architecture and decorations inside and out, spanning several centuries. Musicians playing accordian, bass and violin on the steps made me think I'd stepped into a 1960s Italian movie.",

          "I was advised to visit the cattedrale di san lorenzo prior to our visit to genoa and was glad I took the advice, I have visit lots of churches and cathedrals on our travel's but few have matched and even fewer have bettered the magnificence externally or internally of this most",

          "Remarkable Cathedrale built from marble collected from all the sailing ships that called Genoa home. It's black on white exterior almost gives it a checkerboard look. Legend has it that the primary builder for the church had a dog that was at his side day and nite. Without",
          "It's worthy even only from outside, very big, well mantained...Definetively it worths a visit. It's very difficult to take a picture from outside because very often there's a market or any other event can take place just in front. Interesting also the legend about the sculptured",
          "This is a beautiful church, housing the remains of St. John the Baptist. It doesn't take long to visit, and so should be a must see on everyone's visit to Genova. Inside the tesoro of the church (treasury) is housed what is believed to be the Holy Grail.",
          "The Cattedrale di San Lorenzo was excellent. The stained glass windows were beautiful as was the whole church. A very speacial place.",

          "Although not huge like Notre Dame or the Milano Duomo, this place of worship is simply overwhelming in its simple beauty and proportions. Sit there for a while and let the atmosphere and good vibrations sink in - you won't regret the time spent there, not to mention all the",
          "Great cathedral. Closed 1200-1500. The reliquary in the basement is excellent. I've never been so close to priceless extraordinary objects. Costs about 6 euro and includes a visit to a nearby museum (afternoon only) which has wall hangings which I am yet to understand.",

          "Whilst very old and interesting interior is not as stunning as other churches. For architecture experts maybe a higher rating",
          "I loved the statues on the outside of this magnificent Cathedral. The square in front had excellent acoustics showed off admirably by a busker.",

          "The cathedral has a distinct architectural style. Beautiful inside and out. It is kept a bit dark on the inside, but one is still able to see the great statues and Genoese Gothic style with Romanesque arches. It's a definite must see.",

          "My husband was very impressed with this cathedral - I tell you this, because he often says.....not another cathedral!! It is a fully active church, and yet, the art work is amazing. There are ceiling frescoes in a chapel on the north by Luca Cambiaso; a Crucifixion with Saints",
          "I couldn't believe how breathtakingly beautiful this cathedral was, both inside and out. I cam here as part of a Regent Seven Seas cruise ground excursion and immediately fell in love with everything Genoa. I really had no idea what to expect going in, since I hadn't heard",

        "wiki": "The Castello d'Albertis, or D'Albertis Castle is a historical residence in Genoa, north-western Italy. It was the home of sea captain Enrico Alberto d'Albertis, and was donated to the city of Genoa on his death in 1932. It currently houses the  Museo delle Culture del Mondo  (Museum of World Cultures), inaugurated in 2004.\n\n\n== Description ==\nD'Albertis designed the castle in the style of an architectural collage with a  Gothic revival appearance inspired by palaces in Florence and castles of Aosta Valley.\nErected between 1886 and 1892 under the supervision of Gothic Revivalist  Alfredo D'Andrade, the castle is located on the site of a 13th-century fortified area, which had been reinforced in the 16th century. Alberto not only based his design on the city's foundation, he incorporated and preserved the foundations of the bastion and one of the turrets.Inaugurated for the celebrations of 400 years of Columbus' discover of America, it was the first villa-castle built in Genoa.From top of the hill of Monte Galletto (or Montegalletto), one of the hills in the district of Castelletto, the castle dominates Genoa with a view of the Ligurian Sea.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nThe museum includes ethnographic and archaeological findings  collected by both Enrico and Luigi Maria d'Albertis during their trips to Africa, America (from Canada to Tierra del Fuego), New Guinea and Oceania. There is a large number of weapons from Sudan and the Zambesi area Chinese spears and European halberds. There are several exemplars of Canadian and American plains indigenous people, made in buffalo and deer leather and covered by porcupine thorns; also findings belonging to the Maya civilization from Honduras are present.\nIt also exhibits models of ships and yachts, nautical instruments, photographs and the volumes of d'Albertis personal library.\nA separate section dedicated to music (the Museo delle Musiche dei Popoli, \"Museum of Peoples' Music\") exhibits musical instruments from the whole world.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMackenzie Castle\nList of castles in Italy\nAscensore Castello d'Albertis-Montegalletto\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWebsite (in Italian)\nD'Albertis Castle at the Museum of World Cultures",

        "wiki": "The Galata - Museo del mare is a maritime museum in the Italian city of Genoa. It is the largest museum of its kind in the Mediterranean area and also one of the most modern in Italy. The museum is located on the grounds of the Porto Antico, in the Palazzo Galata (named after the ancient colony of Galata) in the Darsena district, where galleys were built in the Republic of Genoa era. It is close to downtown Genoa, the Port of Genoa, and within walking distance of Genova Principe train station and Darsena metro stop. It opened in 2004 as part of Genoa's 2004 European Capital of Culture celebration.\n\n\n== History ==\nGalata is a historic district of Istanbul, Turkey, and until the 15th century, home to one of the most important Genoese communities in the Mediterranean. Therefore, in the late 19th century, when the Municipality of Genoa built a district of commercial docks, the oldest of these was given the name of the ancient colony. In the 19th century, this district served as a busy shipyard. In its lower part, the galleys of the Republic of Genoa were built, and it was part of the \"Arsenale\", the most important military and maritime complex in the city. In the 20th century, Galata lost its commercial function and was abandoned. In the late 1990s, the municipality decided to establish the seat of the future maritime museum of Genoa in the Galata district.\nOpened in 2004, the museum is located in the Palazzo Galata, whose renovation was designed by the Spanish architect Guillermo V\u00e1zquez Consuegra. In addition to a natural-scale reproduction of a Genoese galley, the museum houses several interactive rooms which help visitors understand what it meant to go to sea in different eras. One of these is the \"La Merica\" exhibition, open since 2011, dedicated to the history of Italian migration. It shows both the lot of exploited immigrants in Genoa in the 19th century and that of Italian emigrants who traveled to the United States, Argentina, and Brazil on overcrowded ships, and founded an Italian diaspora in the New World. Special emphasis is placed on current immigration trends as well as the European migrant crisis.In 2005, the Galata museum merged with the Commenda Museum-Theater and the Naval Museum of Pegli, together forming the Mu.MA - Istituzione Musei del Mare e delle Migrazioni (Institute of Museums of the Sea and Migration) to better combine the topics of the sea and migration.\n\n\n== The museum ==\nThe ground floor tells the tale of galleys. It houses a faithful reconstruction of a 17th-century Genoese galley placed on the original slipways. The same floor contains the Darsena weapons exhibit with its racks of knives, breastplates, and helmets. Other rooms hold portraits of Christopher Columbus and Andrea Doria as well as precious world maps and ancient portolans which can be consulted using virtual navigation. The exhibit also holds several autographed documents belonging to Columbus.\nThe first and second floors are dedicated to sailing and to shipyards. An entire room is occupied by a reproduction of the brigantine \"Anna\", on which one can access the deck and appreciate many original nautical instruments. Another room shows a reconstruction of a shipyard in the late 18th century, with its various carpentry tools in the mechanical workshop. In yet another room, a virtual reconstruction allows, through sound effects, to experience a storm off Cape Horn.\nThe 1,200m2 third floor houses an exhibition entirely dedicated to the era of transatlantic liners. Visitors can access the bridge of a steamship from the immigrant era, and a naval simulator offers a simulated crossing of the Atlantic from the Strait of Gibraltar to New York, passing under the Statue of Liberty, then on to Ellis Island. Among the objects collected during shipwrecks are a bell from the SS Rex and a lifebuoy used by one of the survivors of the RMS Lusitania.\n\n\n=== Shipowners' Hall ===\nLocated on the third floor of the museum, the Shipowners' Hall was opened on 2 March 2017; it tells the story of Genoa and its port through its protagonists: the shipowners.\n\n\n=== Other exhibits and facilities ===\nThe museum owns the raft which saved Ambrogio Fogar when his boat was hit by orcas in 1978 off the Falkland Islands. Ambrogio survived the ordeal but his travel companion Mauro Mancini died while waiting to be rescued. In 2010, 32 years after the incident, the Fogar family decided to donate the raft to the Galata - Museo del mare museum.Other facilities include an exhibition hall, library, and a caf\u00e9 with an outdoor terrace. The museum attracts many school field trips, and its proximity to Genova Principe train station and Darsena metro stop making it conveniently accessible.\n\n\n=== The submarine museum ===\n\nSince 26 September 2009, the diesel-electric submarine Nazario Sauro (S 518), launched in 1976 by Fincantieri di Monfalcone shipbuilders, has been moored at the dock in front of the Museo del mare. Intended by the Italian Navy to serve the municipality of Genoa, it has been used since 29 May 2010 as a floating annex to the museum.\n\n\n==== Sections of the submarine ====\nParts which can be visited\n\n1.

The exhibits start with the development of Genoa\u2019s harbor and proceeds through: a full size galleon ship, a display on Christopher",
          "Good experience. A nice place to spend an afternoon. The submarine was very nice. I recommend it to everybody.",
          "My wife and I visited the Maitime Museum in Genoa. There was so much history and you could board different vessels inside the 5 storeyed museum. We spent nearly 3 hours there for 13 Euros per person and an additional 6 Euros to visit the inside of a submarine. It is highly",
          "This is a great place for adults and kids, sorry teenagers ! You will learn all about the might and glory from Genoa great navigation period and get to see a model of a 1500 vessel, also a grest aperitivo in the last floor",
          "Full scale Galleon that you can explore, wonderfully detailed models, responsive audio visual displays and amazing original art work all contribute to an understanding of Genoa and its boating heritage. The staff are smiling and friendly. The spaces are dark and art work could",
          "A great experience very informative from the beginning of the Italian sailing right through to modern times. An experience inside a real submarine is well worth the visit. 5 floors which can be a little confusing navigating round each floor as the direction signs are in obvious.",
          "we did the trip and the sub marine tour very good museum get there easily as it dose get busy and very noisy with Italians talking loudly not too much of the exhibits in English but still worth a visit epically the tour of the migrants from 1900 the sub is also good take your",
          "As befits a world class seaport with a long and impressive history of seafaring, Genoa has an equally stunning maritime museum. Like most Italian museums, it's full of interesting hands-on, interactive exhibits, of which its section detailing Italian immigration to the US",
          "Was really looking forward to visitingthis as Genoa has a fascinating maritime history. We were not disappointed. Indeed we spent 3 enthralling hours here but could have spent much longer. An audio guide cost just \u20ac1. The museum starts its maritime story with 2 huge photos of",
          "This is a beautiful museum with a huge number of artifacts, painting, maps and etchings from Genoa's and Italy's history, but we were disappointed in how little effort was made in any language but Italian. There is an audio guide that you pay for but it only covers a few of the",
          "History and modernity in one place, this museum shows not only the complete city's history, but as well many aspects of marine industry, life, massive immigrants waves from the past and so on.",
          "Large, modern museum only a few minutes walk from the Aquarium in Genoa. Full of artefacts, reconstructions of ships you can explore, interactive displays and information. The area devoted to immigration and emigration over the decades is particularly good and bang up to date.",
          "This is a large museum with several different sections. To start with, you'll get to know about Christopher Columbus followed by history of Genova (it's port and the city). You'll be able to get on board of old ships and learn what the life of seamen was like during the time of",
          "Probably the highlight of our visit to Genoa. Loads to see and do. The place is huge and seems to go on and on, up and up. Be careful not to spend too long on the lower floors and not have enough time and energy for the upper decks. The exhibition on migration, for example, is",
          "Given Genoa's history as one of the great seafaring and trading city-state historic nations, it's only fitting that Italy's largest maritime museum is located here. Designed by architect Guillermo Vasquez Consuegra, the museum gives a new life to the former arsenal of the",
          "Very nice place :) Please do not miss the Boat, The kids from 17-5 years enjoy the exhibitions :) one child is free of charge from the three!",
          "Hello, We were at this Maritime Museum and we loved it. The downside is that they have a real submarine that you can visit but the kids below 4 years are not allowed. Anyway go and visit it, because you will not be disappointed. Enjoy!",
          "A very detailed and absorbing museum, if you are interested in all things maritime; naval history and warfare, seafaring, Genoa and the sea, exploration, migration, even sea myths and monsters. Some of the earlier sections are not so well lit, and a few of the exhibits are not",
          "We visited the museum under my other half's insistence. As someone who is not particularly interested in boats I warn all others alike me that this is not for you. This is 3 hours (at a quick pace) of model boats, paintings of boats, information about boats and a couple of life",
          "We loved the museum, especially the interactive parts like the galea and the emigration \"trip\" It is classic and innovative at the same time",
          "Took our 7 and 9 year olds here in June and we all loved it. The immigrant exhibit on the 4th floor was fantastic, we learned so much and the kids were truly fascinated by learning about the people they got assigned to follow. The museum was fairly empty on a weekday afternoon",
          "The museum is worth a visit if you have an interest in the sea and maritime history. There is a lack of english explanation on the exhibits so can be hard to follow if you aren't versed in the finer points. However it is Italy so why should we expect english? I believe there is",
          "There are lovely points like reali life models of ships. Some aspects didn\u2019t meet our understanding. Hence there were no signs in English, though overall it is very nice place to see and visit.",
          "TOURIST TRAP and almost nothing translate to English!!! if you dont understand italian, avoid please! (Maybe if you understand it could worth, not sure).",
          "This is a great museum to visit. My only tip is to ask if they have any headphones for English commentary- we were not given any but there were signs on the way around stating number points for English commentary. Some displays have English and others not, do this would have",
          "The time flew past on our visit to this museum. It is very engaging and a lot of effort has gone into bringing various exhibits to life. A little Italian would be helpful but not a pre-requisite. Would definitely recommend paying the extra for the submarine and the emigration",
          "The Galata Museo del Mare offers a unique perspective on Maritime history...much more than just Columbus, Genova's native son.",
          "As good a maritime museum as I have seen anywhere in the world - possibly even better than Bremerhaven. My only criticism is the apparent lack of staff and attendants, both to welcome you and to supervise the exhibits. This is in stark contrast to the trio of art museums in town",
          "Beautiful museum. But not for foreign tourists. You can ask for an audioguide, but there is so much noise in the museum that it is almost impossible to understand the audioguide. Above all is the explanation that you get too brief. A pity if you ask me.",
          "This museum is amazing if you like history and art. It traces the History of Genoa from Middle Age to now, focusing on special point with interactive means. It takes time to discover everything but it is worth it. You learn a lot about life with the sea, aboard a ship,",
          "Apart from the rooftop seating area which had fantastic views I wouldn\u2019t personally rush to go here- unless of course you are dotty about ships",
          "We were 7 family members with 2 kids, ages 8 and 10. The museum is very well laid out, with several places with interactive displays. Kept the kids very engaged in the tour.",
          "While most of this place is in Italian (as you would expect) there was enough English that you can work it out. It gave me a much better insight into the Italian seafaring history that I had never understood before. I loved the way the had made the higher floors feel like the",
          "I thought this would be a niche museum and only went to see it on my last morning as my museum card gave me access and I had a few hours before my train. I'm very glad I did. It's a fascinating museum, which would be ideal for families with children as it's very interactive. The",
          "Get a historical overview about the harbour of genoa of the last centuries, it has its price, but they took many efforts to illustrate the historical development. story of emigration from europe, andrea doria, 4d simulation with beeing on rough sea (must see!), very impressive",
          "Galata museum is worth visiting. If you decide to visit Genoa, I recommend visiting this museum and Palazzo Reale as they have many interesting things to offer.",
          "To be honest we only had time for a quick visit here but the submarine was interesting and fun and the Genoese longship was amazing. My son loved it in here. We bought the multi ticket which is valid for a year so might make another visit before we head home.",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to this museum. An array of exhibitions, collections of art and replica boats to have a play on. There is so much history across the four floors that you should allow plenty of time to see everything. Also be sure to take the elevator to the roof",
          "A big museum on 4 floors packed with interesting stuff. If you are interested to see a little of everything connected to travel, sea , history and immigration- this is a please to go. It is mostly Italian but has a lot of English plates too. The museum is modern, interactive",
          "Wow, wow, wow! GMdM is maybe the best marine museon I ever have visited. First of all Genoa is not a town: Genoa is sea and huge harbor. GMdM tells all the roots of Genoa. There is lot to for everyone: ships, guns, clothes, maps... even music. Museum tells history of Genoa, why",
          "I really enjoyed the diversity of this museum, touching on Genoa\u2019s history in cruise industry, Italian emigration, naval war history, etc. Most interesting maritime museum I have ever visited.",
          "A good view of Italy's maritime past. Highlights for me were the historic Genoese maps and the model of the Genoese Galley. The story of Italian emmigration was also very well told, with lots of videos and an excellent mock-up of the emigrants sleeping quarters. The jobsworth",
          "This is a great museum, telling you everything you need to know about Genoa's long relationship with the sea.",

          "This large museum takes you through maritime history as it pertains to Italy, Genova, and globally. It is well thought out and takes you through logically successive steps from the 15th century up until modern times, explaining the progression as you go from ground floor to the",
          "Time spent in Galata is really worth. Learn on life at sea and ocean and the exhibit on emigrants past and current is amazing! Migration and inclusion. Andrea Doria Ship story is fascinating and you can\u2019t miss the view from the terrace. Fun and learning for adults and kids! Just",
          "We visited with one 4 years old and one 14 years old and they were both delighted. There are things to see and to experience for all ages. Museum is architectural wonder and it is so well organised and interestingly presented that you won\u2019t be bored. I liked the emigration",
          "Several floors ... You need audio guide , limited english descriptions. Good reproductions of older ships. A little ecclectic in terms of topics, emigration, immigration, boat designs, etc",
          "Great museum dedicated to Genoese maritime history, ships and people's lives. It is very interesting and lots of exhibits are interactive. There are also a 4D storm simulation and few real life models of ships and a submarine. The museum is so big and attractive that you would",
          "A fascinating experience with so much to see and do - especially for younger visitors. I particularly enjoyed the display of old maps and the 'emigrazione e immigrazione' exhibition on the third floor. So well presented and explained!",
          "Nice museum on the 'Mediterranean. Too floor has panorama of the city. A floor on immigration and more",
          "Obviously the history of Genova sailing is beautifully presented but the details of the Andrea Dora, the immigration experience of the 1900-1930\u2019s Italian, and the. Wham-oh, the immigrants in the boats landing at Lampedusa etc. Go on a hot or rainy day and stay 3 hours. You",

          "Enjoyed this visit, but it is quite dark inside (has some ancient manuscripts, so probably to preserve those). Some interesting arrangements of ships old and new. Learned a lot about Genovese history (esp about Chris Columbus) and Genoa's achievements militarily. Some of the",
          "I loved loved loved loved this museum. Don't get me wrong, I also love great art, antiquities, ceramics, etc. But sometimes you also need amazingly cool stuff like a real submarine, a Roman-era war galley, a collection of comic books about sea monsters, and most of all...an",
          "It's big - on 5 floors plus the submarine! You start off on the ground floor with some historical facts on Cristopher Columbus then up to lean how the Genovese made their stupendous wealth. On the second floor you can steer a ship and learn about storms and shipwrecks, while on",
          "I loved this, it was very interactive, you need about 2 hours to fully enjoy the experience but it's really worth it",
          "What a great museum! We all really enjoyed it and underestimated how long we would spend there. The museum is on 4/5 floors and gets better and better as you go up. A lot of Maritime history but also current information on migration from an Italian perspective and globally. We",
          "As others have put it before me, it is indeed much larger than it looks. It is very meticulously organized by floors and themes, and the exhibits are not only amazingly detailed, accurate and masterfully preserved, they are also very engaging. Not just a dusty piece of history",
          "We went with our 7 years old son and we LOVED it! It is a good 2-3 hours spent filled with history of Genoa and its maritime power. Really interesting and is definitely suitable for young kids, adolescents and adults. We would highly recommend it and we would also recommend to",
          "Some wonderful exhibits including two full size ships. Covers Genova's links with the sea from pre Columbus to the present day. Only disappointment was that despite the great presentations and information, quite a lot of these have no translation.",
          "I went with my 14 year old son in June to the Museo del Mare. It is huge. We got the audio guides and did most of the museum. There are full sized ships inside. With many details about he history of Genoa and the sea, and how ships and the habor worked back then. We enjoyed",

          "Better than I expected. Excellent for children and adults alike. Very informative about Genova, its sea-faring republican past (it was one of the main maritime city-states and small empires (Repubbliche Marinare) with its rivals Venice, Pisa and Amalfi. Very interesting part on",
          "A must see for a marine enthusiast...tells a great deal about the history of Genoa. Equally Insightful for young children and adults. The museum transforms you to the world of high seas. You learn a great deal about history, and can also relate to a lot of movies made on high",
          "The museum was almost empty when we visited so it was easy and nice to explore. A lot of history with some very nice exhibitions and possibilities for kids to try things. Submarine was also nice. Nice way to spend 2-3 hours while in Genova.",
          "A brilliant museum at Genoa port. Full of interesting collections and large scale reproductions. The history covers a huge amount and was very informative.",
          "We were really impressed with the exhibits here. Highlight was an immersive exhibition which puts you in the shoes of early 20th century Italian emigrants. Also there is a cool exhibit on the horrors of the sea in pop culture",
          "I liked the museum and it was a worthwhile couple of hours. as mentioned by others the signs directing you around the exhibits are poor in some places. The audioguide was OK but needs more input. Person at the cash desk was a bit stroppy. Maybe it was a bad day for her.",

          "If you come to Genoa don't skip this amazing attraction, it definitely deserves a visit, either with children or only adults. It's big, has a lot of great attractions for kids and it's really interesting for adults. There are 4 floors for all tastes! It's also possible to",

          "This museum is well worth the visit. A friend, who is a local, recommended highly so I thought I'd give it a chance. It got my interest from the beginning with its display of a full size galley ship ( I was reading a book about vikings at the time). It went on to show many",
          "Having been fortunate enough to visit many museums in cities round the world we would rate this as one of the best city museums we have visited. It is huge on four floors with great views from the roof terrace. There is loads of information in English ( not always the case in",

          "This museum is chock-full of information on the entirety of Genoa's maritime history, from the Middle Ages to present day. You can easily spend an afternoon here. A lot of great reconstructions of different types of ships and also a decent amount of art displayed. The highlight",
          "A wonderful museum, especially the re-creation of the experiences of emigrants in the 19th/20th centuries",
          "Very interesting but also very big museum (reserve maybe 2-3 hours). All of it was interesting but it was almost too much. The highlight was the submarine at the end. You'll need to pick up your hard hats near the ticket counter first. Didn't find the sub to claustrophobic at",
          "I was really knocked out by this place. It is amazingly well put together and well displayed. There is all the history (some wonderful paintings of Genoa) but then there are whole boats for you to clamber round! A must see.",
          "On a one day visit to Genoa I included a stop at this wonderful maritime museum down Near the water. The exhibits are very educational about the history of Genoese sailing with some beautiful ship models and nautical art work. The top floor has a fascinating exhibit covering",
          "I had a great time in this amazing interactive museum. This museum gives you the feeling of immigrating from Italy 100 years ago. Everything is so informative, intersting and fun. Perfect for all ages.",
          "If you like maritime, navigation or immigration history museums, this is your place. If you don't like these museums, you will find these 4 interactive floors a new and positive surprise. Usually kids love it and it's educational for them as well, in particular nowadays. Full of",
          "A gorgeous museum, complete, well organized, where you can have a complete view about history of Genova absolutely not boring. Don't miss that experience! 17 euro really well payed for. A terrific view from the top.",
          "The museum is HUGE. There are four floors of incredibly thoughtful interior that is made to look like inside of a ship or cabin, or inside of a whale. Every room and gallery is different, aswell as spacious. Paintings, boats which you can get on, trying out how it felt like to",
          "Excellent history of navigation and immigration. Truly brings the context of Genoa as a port city to life. We especially liked the exhibit on Italian emigration from Genoa to the Americas, and more recent immigration to Italy from the wider world. The museum is large and well -",
          "This museum is very good, It has interactive zones and very well displayed. It has activities for kids as well. You can really walk through the history of maritime transportation. It can be combined with a visit with the submarine harboured nearby",
          "why it was special...because galata is a district of istanbul and in the beginning it was founded by the people of genoa...genoese people came to constantinople (istanbul) and constructed the galata tower to check thier maritime commerce.so it was a review of those days as well",
          "Interesting but a bit chaotic and overrun with noisy children - although as parents ourselves we were happy to see youngsters there. We particularly appreciated the 4th floor exhibition on emigration. On the other floors, we found the full-size ships and maps interesting.",
          "This is a vast display of history over four floors..a lot to take in. Great displays of old world vessels..audio graphics. But to it justice you need time",
          "for me as seaman - it is was great time . the history of the Genovese maritime were very interesting. Many thanks to all for making such interesting museum.",
          "The submarine made my day !! Best thing in my trip to genova. Very organized but be careful not to trip or drop ur keys !",
          "A really wortwhile visit, showing a full history of genovese maritime activities. One could spend half a day in there.",
          "The museum is built in an ancient buinding in which the 'galere', the ships of the Republic of Genoa were built. The museus tells the story of the city and of the Republic, his relation with the sea, the commerces and the seatravels. The recostruction of a 'galea and of a brig,",
          "Great museum shop and the museum has something for all ages. Particularly enjoyed the sections where you walk through ships, the 4D experience and the exhibit about immigration. Wish I'd been offered the audio guide....I read and speak Italian but not all",
          "5 floors of museum with life-size replica boats. For me the best sections were the ones on migration which had some good interactive displays. Good views from roof.",
          "This museum, while filled with interesting objects, was badly signed, especially for those not speaking Italian.",
          "On the ground floor you will begin your journey through the maritime history of Genoa. The exhibits explain the development of the port and it's importance in the history of trade, the way the port itself was constructed and the types of vessels using it. The exhibits even",
          "I went to see for 20 years but the museum was educational. The vessels that you could walk through were amazing. The walk in model in the emigration section gave me a new appreciation of what my ancestors went through to make a new life in America.",
          "Despite reading minimal Italian we spent an interesting three hours in the museum. Huge range of exhibits on a nautical theme: learnt about zombies, kraken, the Italian diaspora to South America, how to row a galley and why Christopher Columbus definitely came from Genoa. Plus",
          "Great museum, especially if you're into naval exploration and history in general. Takes you way back when Genoa was a superpower. Seriously amazing installations, very interactive, probably one of the best thought out museums I've ever been to, and I've been to a lot. Bring your",
          "The museum has gone to s lot of trouble and expense to tell the story of the ancient port and sailing history in Genoa. This will not be to everyone's liking but if a bit of history is your thing then this could be for you. Very family friendly with everyone able to climb on",
          "Interesting models of ships interesting maps. Not enough activating things to do for children. Adults and teensger kids only.",
          "We bought joint Galata Museum and Acquarium tickets. They were not cheap, but the Galata part of the ticket was definitely worth it. First of all, at the entrance nobody checked our tickets. We just wandered in and out without being challenged. The first two floors were OK;",
          "I didn't expect too much from this museum, but they surprised me with big collection of various items, and with many interactive display how it was. It is very huge and you can spend 2+ hours to explore it. Ticket is 12\u20ac.",
          "If you had an afternoon to spare, then this is the place to go! Very interactive exhibitions, a fab balcony cafe, and gorgeous views from the top floor as surrounded by glass! A very nice place to escape the heat - took us 3 hours but could do it in less time! There were",
          "Spent 2-3 hours exploring just the first couple of floors of this museum. Love the history of the development of the city of Genoa & it's significant contributions to the Age of Exploration. Highly recommended!!!",
          "It was such a beautiful experience! It's not just about the history of the city, it is much more! So interractive! We had a lot of fun. I only regret I couldn't stay more inside!",
          "We enjoyed a few hours wandering around this museum and the submarine attached at the time. A fascinating history into the shipping and life aboard. Some great exhibts that would appeal to any age.",
          "very interesting both for adults and children has a very large and nice exhibition hall, a place you must see in Genova",

          "Very interesting museum that offers information regarding the maritime history of Genoa. Fun for the whole family. Highly recommend it!!! The gift shop is nothing special but the museum itself is awesome.",
          "When in Genoa don\u2019t forget that this is one of the most important maritime cities of the Mediterranean \u2013 with the largest maritime museum in the Mediterranean. Situated in the harbor it is part of AcquarioVillage with a number of attractions. See it for yourself and feel like",
          "Even though it was a rainy day, I had decided against paying a rather large entrance fee to the museum itself and was actually coming out of the Movie Museum when my attention was drawn to the 'rotating platform' on the edge of the harbour. I was intrigued and then impressed",
          "We didn't really like the flow of the museum, finding it very confusing. It was also mostly in Italian, which, for those not reasonably fluent in the language, would be a real struggle.",
          "I am not really interested in maritime history, but this museum was a good choice to spend two hours on a rainy day. Unfortunately the submarine was closed due to the bad weather, but inside a building you can find rather interesting exhibitions. I really enjoyed the upper level",
          "This was an amazing find. Get the English audio guide and learn about Genoa's storied history at sea. This modern museum is housed next to the harbor. Be sure to visit the roof top for the views. You can go through their emigration display, and travel as an Italian emigrant.",
          "For those loving the maritime history this is the place to spend a full morning. The infrastructe is of world class. Having visited various maritime museans in the world, this, by far is the best. Can be visit with youngsters as it is very well cured.",
          "Worth the time. I learned a lot about Christopher Columbus. Also there was very detailed information about ships and the people that rode them. I was surprised about the information. There was also an area about emigrants going overseas.",
          "Lots of details to read about the Genoa history in maritime activities. There are some real size reproductions to visit and outside also a real small submarine.",
          "we wanted visit just the submarine (well worth the visit) but we had to purchase the whole full price ticket of the museum. we didn't have much time so we had to skip the museum and PAY FULL PRICE anyway! 46Euros for 10 minutes visit of the submarine. Luckily it was just us, so",
          "Very exiting destination for children especially the last two floors. Adults too can appreciate the history of this city. I very much liked the exhibition about migration.",
          "Really well laid out and interesting. There are some explanation boards in English but if I went again I would go for the audio guide.",
          "This site has a museum featuring the evolution of the port and especially the immigrants who passed thru here on their way to the US over 100 years ago- my great grandparents included!",
          "Not boring at all like some museums. History but also fun in the storm room where a 3D storm is simulated. Have a try and also enjoy the terrace on top with stunning view.",
          "The museum seems to be very interesting, but the day of the visit it was crowed with little noisy and misbehaved children, and we couldn't stay very long. We thought however that the structure of the visit could be different, with a clear introduction leading to the historic",
          "This museum was the first thing I visited in Genova. I didn't found it incredible, but it wasn't horrible. I would describe it as decent. I visited also the submarine. The price was very high for the experience and the staff was pretty bored and not very nice. They gave me some",
          "Galata museum is a great way to spent half day in Genoa. It is an interactive museum were kids can see ships in real size, touch, play and experience the sailing. Apart from ships display it has some hidden gems such as three of the Christopher Columbus original letters or the",
          "Interesting and well laid out with reconstructions of life at sea and the story of emigration. Earphones available for info in English at 1\u20ac, which is recommended, as there are limited details on exhibits in other languages. Submarine visit at end great too...hard hats provided",
          "Leave yourself lots of time to explore the endless rooms and information on maritime history - local (Christopher Columbus, etc) and global. I'm not a history of ship buff, but I found it very interesting. Our 11 and 12 year olds loved it too. Our favourite sections were on",
          "This museum uses a range of media to richly describe the maritime history of this town of the sea. The explanations are fulsome and detailed, and the displays are interesting and draw you it to the discussion of the history of the town and port. It is a museum that is worth",
          "It's a must for both history lovers and any those interested in whatever regards sea. Don't miss it!",
          "I skipped this museum the first time I was in Genoa, but was so glad to have made the time to explore it this visit. Make sure you get the museum pass if you will be in the city for a few days as it includes entrance to the Marine museum as well as 19 others. The marine",
          "Most of the displays do not offer English so you can not catch the story. There could be more material regarding Cristoforo Colombus and Andrea Doria. Materials has no link in between and do not offer much for a city with so old history in navy and sea commerce. Highlights",
          "Allow nearly a whole day here if you can, because there are several floors to the museum and there is the whole history of Genoa to take in, from the 15th century and Christopher Columbus right up to Genovese migration to the US in the Depression years. There are wonderful",
          "Lots to see here for all ages. English captions are erratic, but there are some. Very nice eatery with views over the harbour.",
          "State of the art modern naval museum, with great models of ancient ships and equipment. Mock up life size slave ship and Ocean liners etc. Both adults and kids loved it, walk through the whale's mouth and a real submarine in the dock to explore too. Educate your child the easy",
          "The museum covers the history of Genova from a maratime prospective through paintings, maps, models and a variety of exhibits. Of particular interest are several full size replicas of ships which you can walk through. Also featured is a exhibit on Italian immigrants.",
          "We did the package where we visited both the aquarium and museum! We had a really enjoyable time. Joining aboard the ship was my favourite part as you got given a character to follow! Definitely worth a visit especially on a rainy day!! Fun for all the family and would recommend",
          "We visited on an inclusive ticket, loads of walking over many floors, a hard day for the less mobile. Loads of histoy, LOTS TO READ!. For us, it got better an more interesting the higher we went, but so much walking, after the aquarium.",
          "Worth a visit, we combined our ticket with the aquarium and the submarine, we booked our tickets online the night before using our free wifi at the hotel, it gave us at least 15euros discount. The museum is vast, interactive too so ideal for children as well as adults. Highly",
          "This museum is a must for anyone with any interest in Maritime history or a love of the sea and boats. The exhibits are very well thought out with a lot of interactive features and when you think you're nearly at the end, it keeps going! Obviously most of the information is in",
          "Make sure you pick up a leaflet with details of what is on each floor, and this museum is included on the 24/48 hour museum ticket. The museum is a very short walk along the sea front from the Acquarium. From the top floor you get a good city view with various landmarks pointed",
          "This is a beautiful new museum on the harbor. It contains displays on Genoa's maritime history, including full-scale models of galleys and other boats. There are maps, paintings, and lots of interactive displays for children. It treats everything from mercantile success to the",
          "This museum is located in a centuries old Genoa portside building. Basic admission is 12 Euros for adults and 10 Euros for seniors and military. An additional 5 Euros is required for admission to the recent vintage submarine moored alongside. Audio devices are available for",
          "Three floors of history for this amazing museum along the seaside in the Porto Antico area. First floor dedicated to medieval times with a real ship under constraction in the old shipyard which was based there in the old times. Second floor for more modern times with",
          "This is a fabulous maritime museum. The exhibits chronicle the history of the port and the contributions of local-born famous navigators. The atlases, maps, painting and photographs are a treasure chest of interesting artefacts. The inclusion of the galley, the slave ship Anna",
          "Provides an insight into the history of Genoa. A range of displays to see and a great view from the top floor of the harbour. Very interesting.",
          "Although I didn't get to go on the submarine, I did enjoy my wander through this museum. I spent a long time listening/watching to a video presenting various maps of the city and its change over time and I can imagine that families with kids would have a great time climbing over",
          "Very popular, can get quite crowded. Take your time, there is a lot to see. They have lifts for kids buggies, older people etc.",
          "I've been looking forward to visiting this museum for months now. I love the sea and have sailed since I was a child so I was very excited when we got to the museum. When we got to the desk, we asked if the displays were in english and were told that yes. The first section (a",
          "Contrary to what many reviewers said I didn't find this museum really interactive. That was probably because most of the explanations and films were in Italian only and we didn't take the audio guide. We didn't get as far as the third floor where the immigration exposition is -",
          "We spent a few hours in the Galata Museo del Mare and thoroughly enjoyed it. We took the English audio guide and it was worthwhile as most of the written information on the displays is in Italian. The museum is over a number of levels so there is a lot of walking but there are",
          "We had wanted to visit for a while and only got round to it during this year's trip. It was well worth it. The museum has a good balance of more intellectual aspects and information as well as interactive elements (and I say this as an adult - the interactive aspects are",
          "We've visited the museum on the 11th of Aprilie 2015 and it is fascinating... the scene of the two lovers on the Titanic is a verry good idee",
          "This is a good history of Italian Immigration, the port, shipping and general Naval. We took about two hours touring the museum and probably should have taken longer. But there was a large group of school children behind us and we wanted to stay ahead where is was more quiet.",
          "Spread over 4 floors and a floating submarine exhibit you need some time to do this place justice The history of the city and port is detailed and clearly for those interested to spend the time and the same holds true of the evolution of navigation and instruments The replica",
          "We spent a few hours at this great museum. For anyone with a passing interest in the history of the sea and Genoa's role. Great exhibits, interactive displays, scale model replicas giving you a feel for life on the sea. My wife enjoyed our visit here. She had doubts at first.",
          "It's a very nice museum for adults and children. A lot of boats you can get in to. Two flaws: 1. Not a lot of English explanations. 2. A lot of stairs, very inconvenient with a child's stroller.",
          "This is a must see attraction in Genoa. In any case there are not many maritime museums around, but going to one in one of the most famous shipping cities is a definite must in my book. The museum btw is huge and very well organised. A problem is the lack of descriptions in",
          "This reasonably priced museum is just a few steps down the quai. It richly tells the story of The Republic of Genoa and the city's subsequent maritime history. Lots of multimedia, there are many interactive exhibits. Excellent for children and not crowded, even on a Summer",
          "Good day out in the Museum. really enjoyed it as did my son. If you pay a little extra you can visit the submarine. Well worth it!",
          "Great experience and very interesting to explore. Everything has English translation. The museum is very close to the aquarium. The kids enjoyed the most the submarine visit!!",
          "The museum tells you about the nautical aspect of Genoa from the Dark ages and until the present day. The installations are nothing short of amazing and the museum is very coherent: as you go through different rooms, you are being treated to a story, rather than a series of",
          "Like others we found there wasn't enough in English and my Italian is too limited as yet to be of any help. Some of the exhibits are a bit 'dry' but the replica ships are pretty good. For us though the star of the show is the section on Italian emigration to the Americas. Really",
          "We were really hoping that this museum would explain a lot about Genoa's association with the sea and in particular Christopher Columbus, who was allegedly born there although nobody seems entirely sure, but unfortunately (though not unsurprisingly) almost everything was written",
          "We were a little hesitant about going because of the price, \u20ac12 for adult \u20ac7 for a student, but it was very cool and took up a couple hours of our day. They had a lot of interesting information and exhibits about the life at sea. The only downside was that about half the stuff",
          "It is a real travel through the history of navigation and new lands exploration! Visiting this museum means travelling by see as sailor, passenger or migrant experiencing the hard life on board, the severe storms that can lead to wreck and the high- or low-level services",
          "I went to this museum based on other's reviews here on TA. To be honest, this was a solid 3 stars for most of my visit. Many of the displays didn't have English translations, and many of those that did were a little hard to understand. I got the audio guide (extra 1 Euro),",
          "I think the Italian Americans would love this as it includes a really well done exhibition on emigration to the USA. Overall a good mix of interactive and informative. Some of the explanations are only in Italian so take the audio guide if you want all the information. Only in",
          "This was the highlight on our trip to Genoa. The museum has everything you can imagine and more. Very informative, interesting and appealing. Never have I had so many emotional experiences in a museum before. Didn't expect to find large boats, oil paintings and miniature figures",
          "Usually an hour is enough for me around a museum, This one is so varied and well presented, travelling through the history of Genoa and linking up with the todays issues with immigration, My favourite bit was the interaction of going through customs as if emigrating to USA, I",
          "This was a very interesting museum with a wide variety of exhibits related to maritime activity. There were many artifacts from Christopher Columbus, including letters that he had written. There were several replicas of ships, some of which could actually be boarded. There were",
          "Coming from Australia 95% of the population are of immigrant stock .... so the displays of immigrants leaving for distant lands have real relevance",
          "We dropped by for lunch passing through to the ferry terminal had pizza and spaghetti we sat watching the boats had blass of acidic house white but the bottled beer was cold and cheap.if only some one made the effort with the presentation. the view was the best bit",
          "It may not be clear from the outside, but this museum is really big. Can easily spend the whole day there. I really enjoyed the reconstruction of ships, from the old days up to submarine (a real one!). We had to cut the visit short to catch the train, but I would have stayed",
          "Because Genoa was such a major sea power this museum is really one that covers much of the history of the city. There are a wonderful mix of charts, models and art relating to its naval history. It also has a section about the emigration of many Italians to the new world and",
          "this is a great museum....not only do you get to learn all about Genova's history as a naval port, but you also get to climb aboard ships, enter into a submarine, and you see a relic holding Christopher Columbus's ashes.....",
          "Walked around the museum for a couple of hours. Most of the information is in Italian. There seemed to be in-depth descriptions of objects and paintings in Italian, with only the names written in English. I understand that I am in Italy, but all of the other museums seemed to",
          "What a fantastic museum. Informative, & a great hands on section of a galleon. 2 life size replicas you can walk onto as well as walk through exhibition of the immigration experience.",
          "A great museum, even for less nautical types. Plenty of hands-on stuff for kids. Don't miss the submarine!",
          "Well worth a visit, nice aquarium but original galleon ship is fantast worth an hour roaming around the galleon and nice view of harbour. Cafe's all along the front near aquarium.",
          "We spent an entire day here with the four kids, and after having seen so many churches in museums in Genoa,this was a welcome break for all of us. As advertised, the place is huge, and has something for everyone of all ages. My only minor complaint is the price, which came out",
          "especially as representations that the old ships and objects from the former time are impressive. The best we liked the presentation of the immigrants who fled to America in 1900. Quite simply stunning and really very well done. My daughter is determined to keep this museum for",
          "Wasn't really going to many museums as this was more a walking outdoor holiday. Decided to try the maritime museum even tho I am not really into ships. Go go go to this museum and if you have kids bring them. The 3D movies, the sound effects through out are really fun and",
          "In the old port of Genia lies this submarine that could easily go unnoticed. Visit the whole Marine museum and in the ticket the submarine visit is included!",
          "That is a very nice museum if you like the history of the navegations. But is ashame that is not much translation to english. its big, you need at least 3h.",
          "It is huge, you need like 2-3 hours to see everything. It's beautiful, super interesting, very well organized. A very complete museum with a lot of interesting info from the Cristoforo Colombo era. Just pay for the museum, there is a submarine that you have to pay a little",
          "The obvious glory of this museum is the reconstructed classic Genoese galley on the ground floor but the real star attractions th top floor devoted to the experience of some 2 million Italians who emigrated in the late nineteenth centuries from their harsh live as peasants for a",
          "In this new, modern museum you can discover more about immigration in the 1800's, Christopher Columbus, navigation, etc. You can also enter into real submarine and the rooftop is amazing for taking pictures of the entire city.",
          "We planned to spend a morning here but there was so much to see and it was such an informative and interesting place it took the most part of a day. Thoroughly enjoyable and I would highly recommend it.",
          "I visited this museum in February. This is the best maritime museum that I have ever been too. It is informative and interactive. Everything is in Italian but that doesn't make the experience any less fun. I have been there twice and I plan on going again the first opportunity I",
          "If you are into the sea either modern or historical this place is fantastic. Make sure you get the translators if you don't speak Italian as when you get your ticket and passport for your immigration to America you will miss a lot. You do need the head phones for the whole",
          "Excellent museum, a very pleasant morning. Four floors, airy exhibits well spaced out and many with English interpretations. Several walk on displays of Ships. Many paintings. Many models. Cafe on first floor good for half time break. Also submarine is extra but definitely",
          "There are four floors of museum plus a rooftop view of the city and port. The bottom floor was about Christopher Columbus, exploration, models of Genova in the late 15th century and galleys (rowed vessels). There was a feature about Doria, a local Genovese, who became rich",
          "As several other reviewers have said there's a lot in Italian and if you don't read the language initially that's off-putting\u2026but the pictures and maps often speak for themselves and there are enough films with subtitles to tell the story. The gem is the immigration exhibit,",
          "We only gave ourselves 2 hours to get around the museum and the submarine exhibit, which was just barely enough (I'd say 3 hours would be good). Neither my wife or I can read Italian, but there were enough signs in English that it was still a very informative and interesting",
          "This museum was all about Genoa's links with the sea and as a trading post in past times. Some of the displays are modern but enable kids to actually step on board a galley or a submarine, so in that sense, its good fun for them. Many different displays - shipping instruments,",
          "Much of the information in Italian only and there are LOTS of paintings. We enjoyed the Map Room and the ship.",
          "A good museum overall but the only problem for us was that a significant of the information was in Italian and we are not fluent. That being said, don't let that put you off going as there is enough to get by and still enjoy the experience. The immigration experience was",
          "This a great place for old and young alike. There was alot of english interpretation, and easy to follow guides. We enjoyed the whole thing. Also the cafe seemed like a good place for lunch",
          "This is a great place to learn about the maritime history of Genoa. It also has excellent displays of old ships, maps and globes. One of the highlights is a sensitively constructed exhibit dedicated to emigration from Italy, which effectively conveys the desperation and",
          "If ever you are in Genova, make sure you set aside several hours to half a day for this museum. It details the full origins of Genova as a trading port, and the exhibits walk you through the evolution of vessels, from the galleon to the vessel to the steamship right down to the",
          "This museum really gets into the interesting maritime heritage of Genoa. There's good stuff for all ages. I found the Christopher Columbus stuff, the old maps and globes, and the Italian emigration stuff fascinating. The view from the roof terrace is great for photography.",
          "Wonderful exhibitions, people who really know how to display and present history to people, especially to youngsters",
          "Although we did not find any of our requested names on the computer roles, the exhibit was wonderfully well done, and a great joy to see. It focuses on the areas of emmigration from Italy, from Genoa especially, and their recreations , adding multimedia, make for a really",
          "Excellent museum dedicated to Genoa's heritage with the sea. It has 5 floors and a submarine outside in the water. If you want to read everything you need to spend at least a 4-6 hours but it is worth it if you have the time. Was even able to look up relatives that emigrated",
          "we spent the morning walking about the museum but it coul take more than a day to see all in detail fantastic detail models of the ships fantastic historical collection real scale parts if ship models to walk in real submarine to visit if you don't read italian dont forget to",
          "As part of an inmigrant family coming from Italy and Spain to Southamerica and after hearing the stories from my grandparents so many times, going to this museum was a MUST. It is really impresive how detailed oriented to the life at those times it is and the conditions in",
          "For me the best bit of this museum was the section on galley warfare and the chance to sit on a rowers bench to see how rowing felt. There were lots of great paintings and models to look at as well as lots of activities for kids.",
          "Some very good interactive displays, the best being the emigration section up top where an impatient customs officer awaits. Catch the 11 AM \"wrecked at sea on a life boat\" experience. Wear a hat to keep your head dry. Lasts about 10 minutes but no small children allowed.",
          "If you're interested in the history of ships and ocean work/travel, you won't want to miss the Museum of the Sea in Genoa. Beautiful displays thoughtfully arranged and with excellent explanatory material.",
          "Compared with the excellent Aquarium in Genoa, this museum misses out, mainly by not having enough explanation in anything other that Italian... this makes it unclear where to go and what you are seeing, unless you are of a maritime background and can put the pieces together",
          "The history of Genoa's relationship with the sea starts with Christopher Columbus on the ground floor and slowly unwinds as you climb upwards. The evolvement of the sailing ship is shown by lots of paintings, charts, and beautifully detailed handmade scale models - one",
          "you go to the Acquario, and see the sea-life, ad fish and so on. You come to Galata, and see what mankind did on the sea in Genova, along history. Superb 3d models of the harbor, great gallery of art with the harbor of Genova as represented along the ages. various sections,",
          "While there is very little in English my husband and I found it great good fun. They have full size replicas of brigantines and a galley that you can walk thro. They also have a very good walk though of a ship used by immigrants to the States from Italy.",
          "There are some excellent exhibits about Genoa's long history on the Mediterranean Sea. Not much commentary is in English, but there's enough to get the gist of things. Especially liked the mocked-up boats you could get into, the immigrant boat circa 1900 was great. Who knew that",
          "Tried to visit this museum with the Genoa Museum Pass, even though the pass clearly said entrance to the museum was included the person on the gate wanted 9 euro more to let me in. When I showed my pass and asked for an explanation as to why they wanted more money and why",
          "The museum has extensive exhibits about the history of Maritime in Genova, some of which are interactive. Excellent and interesting. Make sure you tour the submarine too!",
          "Easzy to tour around - nottices also in English, And the highlight is a visit through an Italian Submarine of the 1970s-80s",
          "Besides the regular museum stuff (which is really nice), they have computers where you can look up your italian relatives. And, for our surprise, my husband found some information about his grandfather which helped him to find documents and now he is almost getting his italian",
          "The museum is located in the old port, which is a beutiful and matching context for a museum celebrating centuries of Genoese sailsmanship. The museum is full of content, exhibits, demonstrations and explanations. Most of the material is translated to English, but not all. The",
          "Starting on the ground level and moving your way up floor to floor arranged chronologically. It starts with the ships of Columbus. and each subsequent floor explores the importance of Genoa history with the sea. At the time of our visit there was a special exhibit on the",
          "Went here when the weather wasn't so good, had such a fun time looking round it all! Never expected there to be so much and so many floors! I've got to say, the roof terrace was the best part for me, the views over the port and surroundings was breath taking!",
          "This is an interpretation centre for Genoa and its relation with the sea. There are some really good recent interactive exhibits but little that's old. It's good fun for an hour or two & kids should enjoy. I thought it was great until I realised at the exit I should have paid to",
          "Interesting modern museum. Replica ships, especially a replica galley are very interesting. There is also a good display about Italian emmigration to America. Most of the exhibits are explained in English, although it is a pity the translation is often poor.",
          "First, what's important to point out is that the museum offers both exhibitions that are of average quality and excellent ones. However, for a fan of naval history it's simply not enough. The part we enjoyed the most was the interactive exhibition about Italian emmigration (and",
          "I was drug here with a friend and I ended up fascinated. I learned so much about the history of this city and I also enjoyed popping into the submarine.",
          "Well worth the 2 plus hours that you will spend here. Great full size replicas of sailing vessels. Provides much insight into Genoa's maritime history and traditions. Admission is reasonable at 10 euros each.",
          "We went there with our 6-ys old daughter who, at the beginning wasn't particularly keen on the kind of museum, and partly because on Saturday it was raining cats and dogs and walking around Genoa's caruggi (narrow alleys) isn't that much fun in a downpour. We had bought a",
          "As a lover of ships and ship models, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to this museum. I liked the full sized ship displays that visitors can walk through such as the galley and merchant ship. There are many interesting nautical paintings, maps, instruments, globes, ship models and",
          "This place has so much potential but it's been largely wasted. Let's start with the arrival. The lady at the ticket desk seemed annoyed that I'd interrupted her conversation with her colleague. Sadly Italian employment law probably means she'll quite comfortably keep her job",
          "I highly recommned everybody who like sea to visit this place. The museum is full of ship models, interactive maps/devices and ancient artifacts. You can get on board of galley and brigantine, to stand at the wheel to feel youself as captain of ocean-going vessel and travel with",
          "This is a very good, extensive museum about the history of Genoa and the sea. We learned a great deal that we didn't know. The section on emigration with a mock up of the early Atlantic ships carrying the immigrants from Italy to America is very well done. The only criticism is",
          "In Genova lacked a museum like this, especially if compared to the big Aquarium. Lots of models, pictures and info, provided in a very pleasant and stimulating way with the help of some good actors (in video). Many original parts of old vessels and ships to see. I found Italian",
          "The museum is HUGE, spanning on five floors, with a docked WWII submarine to visit, as well. What is great is the recreation of whole ships you can visit, with historical re-enactments to give you plenty of infos. What is not so great is that well over 90% of the infos you can",
          "Very interesting tour, considering the construction of boats as well the port of genoa with many interactive poinps also for a public of adults. To make : visit of external submariner.",
          "The history of Genoa as a maritime power extends back beyond Roman times, and this facility has a most extraordinary set of exhibits to tell it ALL! Museums can be tedious at best, but this will capture and entertain you for hours, including a most fascinating collection of",
          "Well designed and executed. Shows not only Genoa's connection to the sea throughout the ages, but one can also visit a genuine submarine, and - best of all - an excellent exhibit about Italian emigration to the New World.",
          "Little antiquarian. A good overview, but dissapointing since replica materials, paintings, models not shown as such.",
          "A very nice history of the town, harbor and boats. Lots of boats and photos getting you back in time, an imaginary immigration to States and a maybe one life time experience visit to a submarine. Don't miss it if you go to Genoa!",
          "We really loved the full sized replica galley and the information about the Italian emmigration, but there were too few descriptions which had been translated into english.",
          "stunning museum with a variety of exhibits related to sea.Must see in every case.Worths its money.dont forget to take your camera with you",
          "A full and fascinating guide to Genoa's maritime history, with lots of boats for children (and adults) to explore. We learnt a lot. It's just a pity that no Genoa museum or visitor attraction has a decent gift shop, compared to those in British museums and galleries - I would",
          "This is one of the best museums for families who are interested in learning about Italian explorers, geographers, and shipbuilders. Starting with Christopher Columbus and authentic letters he wrote to the Genovese government, the first exhibit you see is a real Spanish galley",
          "This place looked closed - it wasn't and has to be a place everyone visits. It is a huge building with many floors but the exhibits are so good - three entire boats in there - a real find.",
          "Vast collection on 4 floors, many life size models, been to a few maritime museums, but this is definitely the biggest I've seen. Interesting exhibition on migrants and their journey across the pond. Shame only about half of written information was available in English and the",
          "This museum was above all my expectations.I never thought that i will enjoy so much a maritime museum.City of Genoa has made excellent work on this museum and this is something you realise from the beginning of your trip.the museum has so many attractions and objects to see and",
          "This is a really good museum if you're interested in maps, ships, ports, commerce, history, emigration, my goodness this could be a long list. To begin there's an enormous display contrasting the current port with the proposed changes. It's marvellously futuristic and would be",
          "Impressive.You can see here some full scale old ships,some old weapons,maps,sailing instruments and even a Diesel submarine(not atomic,how somebody said in a previous review).As a \"bonus\",the last upper level of the museum is a wonderful belvedere terrace that let you to admire",
          "The museum itself is great. Lots of stuff to see and well organized. But we missed detailed information in English. The main sign have an English translation, but the detailed signs, the audioguide in the museum and videos are in Italian only. Because of this it was for example",
          "Excellent museum with very detailed and impressive quality displays, the ships, the chart rooms, all excellent. You will need about 2 hours in total but more if you want to check out all the details. The price is a bit on the steep side, 3 adults & 2 children plus the",

        "wiki": "The Doge's Palace (Italian: Palazzo Ducale) is a historical building in Genoa, northern Italy. \nOnce the home of the Doges of Genoa, it is now a museum and a centre for cultural events and arts exhibitions. It is situated in the heart of the city, with two different entrances and fa\u00e7ades, the main one on Piazza Matteotti, and the second one on Piazza De Ferrari.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first parts of the Palace were built between 1251 and 1275, during the flourishing period of the Republican history of Genoa, while the Torre Grimaldina (also named \"Torre del Popolo\" - Tower of the People) was completed in 1539.The palace originated from the acquisition by the commune of Genoa of  houses of the Doria between San Matteo and San Lorenzo churches (1291), after which the construction of an annexed new building was started. To this, in 1294, a tower of the Fieschi family was added. The palace was restored in the 1590s by Andrea Ceresola. Around 1655, the Ducal Chapel was frescoed by Giovanni Battista Carlone and Domenico Fiasella. In 1777, it was subject to a fire, and was subsequently rebuilt in Neoclassicist style by Simone Cantoni.\nOn the main floor, the so-called Piano Nobile, are the frescoed halls of the Maggior and Minor Consiglio, where many public events take place.\nThe Palace of the Doges was restored in 1992, in occasion of the celebrations of Christopher Columbus and the 500th anniversary of the discovery of the Americas.\nIn July 2001 the Palace hosted the G8 Summit, which was attended by the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, United Kingdom and United States.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website of the Palace of the Doges of Genoa",

          "Much of your enjoyment while visiting Palazzo Ducale will depend on what is showing in their many exhibition areas. Check their website www.palazzoducale.genova.it and use google to translate to see all the current offerings which frequently offer free exhibitions and",
          "This is in my opinion one of the best exibition of pictures of Steve McCurry; there are more than 200 works on display and they cover a large pat of the artistic experience of Mr. McCurry. There are also few pictures of the Tierra! project where sustainability activities have",

          "The building itself is beautiful but the exhibits that they have are great all the time and very well done. I visited the Miro's exhibit and ready to go see the McKurry exhibit with I heard is fantastic. The palazzo is also very easy to find as it is in the heart of the city",
          "Mente Locale, inside the Palazzo, has very nice evening aperitifs, with lots of free tastings when you order a drink. The palace is quite beautiful as well. Nothing in Genova is as spectacular as other italian cities like Venice or Rome, but this building is worth a visit if you",
          "Unfortunately, the exhibition, Van Gogh/Gauguin has closed but there are currently some smaller exhibitions going on at Palazzo Ducale, including important Italian photographers. We expect another wonderful art exhibition in the Fall 2012. Enjoy your time in Genova.",
          "We were not lucky to get on the Van Gogh and Gauguin exhibition as it was the last day and the line was just huge!!! But it was ok as we have already seen lots of their works in other galleries and museums, but I thought the building itself is more special and spectacular.",
          "Magnificent building many hundreds of years old. Its an art gallery, concert venue, cultural center. Worth a look.",
          "I saw an art exhibition here. I booked online in advance which let me go to the front of a 300 strong queue - even though it was before 11 am. So I would recommend visiting major shows only if you pre-book. Every bag including handbags must be checked into the cloakroom so put",
          "This palazzo has a collection that includes works by Titian, Durer and Caravaggio.",
          "Saw some great artists here and the museum was not too large for our very small girls. They enjoyed it as well. Saw art by Gauguin, Monet, and Van Gogh!",

          "We went to see the Van Gogh an Gauguin exhibition. After waiting on a queue I found out that I have to pay additional 6\u20ac for headphoenes device. I've been in many museums around the world and usually there is no fee for translation device, or at least it is symbolic. A friend",
          "Very interesting and well done the present Van Gogh exhibition.",
          "We went to see the Gauguin and Van Gogh exhibition. Firstly, it was hard to locate the box office. We later met a couple who had failed completely to find it - it's next to the cafe on the ground floor. then we almost joined a conference on Human Rights, as the signage was so",

          "You can visit three palazzi for 7 euros and see some fascinating works of art by well-known and not so famous artists. You can appreciate the grandiose architechture and soak in the atmosphere.",
          "Palazzo Rosso is by far the most impressive of the three. Rosso ends at the roof with the opportunity to see a panorama of Genova. I was disappointed in the Courtyard of Palazzo Bianco as it was overrun with weeds and the greenery browning from neglect. Yet it looked so",
          "If you visit Genoa, this is a must. 3 Palaces one next to the other. All worth seeing, especially if you are interested in paintings. There are hundreds. Most of them religious themes. Not that many are outstanding. Maybe the best are the several Van Dyks.",
          "This comprises three adjacent museums, two next door to one another on one side of the street and linked internally; and the other, Palazzo Rosso, almost opposite on the other side. Palazzo Rosso stands out as by far the best - unless you're into wall after wall of religious",
          "Definitely not to be missed. This street is really the most impressive collection of Italian palazzi you are likely to find. It is like moving back in time.",
          "We really enjoyed visiting the museums, strada Nuova is beautiful and all the palazzi were amazing to visit inside. Really nice the view from Palazzo Rosso and the gardens in Pazzo Bianco/Tursi. Good price for combined ticket, not to be missed when visiting Genova!",
          "The building itself is beautiful and the rooms are well laid out with beautiful paintings/tapestries/sculptures. I would recommend this purely for the view that you can get from the top of the building of all of genoa!",
          "We only went to Palazzi Rossi. This alone was more than enough. We're not even sure we were able to spot their most famous paitnings. But the building is facinaiting enough to make a visit!",
          "This consists of 3 buildings, former palaces and some of the rooms and ceilings are impressively decorated and grand in scale. There are several floors and small garden terraced areas. The major 'name' paintings are by Italian artists , not surprisingly and perhaps,",

          "I was quite surprised by how interesting I found this museum. The art is interesting as is the palace and at the end, you get to go on to the roof and the view of Genoa is breath-taking. You buy the tickets from across the road in the shop and it is worth every penny. Allow a",
          "These are truly beautiful museums with lovely interiors and masses of incredible paintings - the height of which was for me the Paganini room with his Cannon violin. However, we were bemused to be told by staff to go in a certain direction - and we could not return to the rooms",
          "We visited four museums that are right by each other. Each museum has beautiful paintings along with many interesting things about each one.",
          "You haven't seen Genoa if you haven't visited at least one of the palazzi build from the profit made by investors in the early voyages of Christopher Colombus and his contemporries to South America. This is serious wealth, from paintings to the sheer exuberance of the buildings",
          "The three Palazzi museums, Rosso, Bianco and Tursi, make up Musei di Strada Nuova (the original name of Via Garibaldi). These museums are a top draw in Genoa/Genova but Palazzo Rosso was my favorite. Each one will take 30-60 minutes to tour depending on your interests.",
          "Ok this the grandest street you will ever walk down. It appears that the wealth from trade was spent on these splendid palaces. Such beauty. Such wealth probably a shame they didn't share a little.",
          "This street and these wonderful palaces are so beautifully preserved that you get the feeling of being transported back to the 16th century. Rich art works fill all the rooms and the size of the entrances and great halls is amazing. One room after another of beautiful",
          "These museums are in palaces built in the 16th and 17th centuries for Genoa's elite families. Rubens made an engraved series of them because he was so impressed. The ones that are open to the public contain great works of art.",
          "Visited the great 3 museums on the Strada Nuovo. Not so interested in the art works but the Hall of mirrors was wonderful and the ceiling paintings were still in fine condition. Take time to go up in the lift to the high point for the city view. We had the benefit of sound",
          "We went here on a rainy day to explore the historic buildings and art in the 3 palazzos. Some parts were closed due to the bad weather but overall it was a great experience. There is a lot to see, maybe even to much. The buildings itselfs are already worth visiting, great",
          "Went by myself, tickets are \u20ac9 for all three palaces, which I found reasonable. Some places were under construction when I went in July 2015 so I didn't get to see everything. There was still a lot of content so I'd recommend going.",
          "These museums are a nice way to spend a couple of hours (or more if you are that sort!) The Museo Bianca has great art. The Museo Tursi - well, we couldn't find much at all. But it is a wonderful building full of administrative offices, and poor signage!! The ticket was cheap,",
          "These three palazzi are simply gorgeous and a must see in Genoa. There are a lot of important painters and breathtaking masterpieces (such as the marvellous Canova's la Maddalena Penitente). However, I would suggest to visit them only to people who are interested and know",
          "The title says it all. These are amazing buildings with a great view over the city and fantastic furnishings and some terrific tromp l'oiel. The paintings are a lot of early Christian tales illustrated with white people in renaissance clothing.",
          "I was disappointed in these museums except for the excellent opportunity to ride to the roof for a panoramic view of the city and harbour of Genoa. The \"three\" museums are integrated, but you can opt out of various parts. We thought the paintings rather bland, mostly artists",
          "We paid 9e each for the visit to the three palazzos od Rosso, Bianco and Tursi. We are not greatly into paintings so the best parts were the period furniture on level 3 of Palazzo Rosso and the rooftop views of the city - take the lift on level 3 to level 9. We also were there",
          "Straddling three Palazzos,the visit of this Museum is akin to a treasure hunt. The best segments are in the Palazzo Bianco and the Palazzo Rosso . The latter also includes and incredible roof top view of the city literally not for vertigo inclined visitors. The Palazzo Tursi",
          "We took a walking tour of Genoa. Sundays at 10am there is an English tour! Meet at the ticketing office near the Aquarium. Do not wait at the \"I\" tourist information kiosk, we did, and almost missed the tour. $12 Euro. with it free entrance to the three Musei di Strada Nuova",
          "On the one rainy day of our stay, we went to Genoa to see some museums. We started at the Palazzo Rosso and ended up spending a couple of hours there. The art collection was huge and very beautiful. Even the ceilings had paintings (murals?) on them in many of the rooms. The",
          "The museums along Via Garibaldi are known collectively as the 'Musei di Strada Nuova' - the individual buildings are the Palazzo Bianco, Palazzo Rosso and Palazzo Tursi. You have to buy your entry ticket (valid for all three) from the bookshop between Bianco and Tursi before",
          "The art collection was interesting (but I must admit, not entirely captivating to a non-art-connoisseur), the interiors on the higher floors were fantastic, but the true highlight for me was the elevator to the rooftop, where you have an amazing 360degree view of the city.",
          "An eclectic art collection, beautifully restored rooms, and the wonderful view from the rooftop, makes this a must see! The highlight was when a guard opened a solid door and left us alone in a library where Paganini's violin and violin case was displayed. Guides direct you",
          "Not so rich as Pallazo Rosso or Pallazo Reale, but still a palace for you to visit. Don't miss this one either. Actually, if you visit Pallazo Rosso, they are connected and you go from one to the other. Beautiful too.",
          "A palace showing you how was the life in Genoa in the past. Many rooms and wonderful exhibits. Don't miss the upper terrace from where you can have a wonderful view of Genoa from the top.",
          "A single ticket will get you entrance to both the Palazzo Rosso and the Palazzo Bianco. Bianco's big attraction in the art collection. Frankly, I was disappointed because much of the collection is by artists of modest talents and the singe Caravaggio was on loan to another",
          "I think they promote it a lot with names like Rubens and they really have just a couple of Rubens. The art that the have is mostly from the 15th-16th century done by artists not known (students or studios) However, at the end of the day art is art and if you have time go and",
          "We visited Genoa on Aug 5th and were surprised by how empty the streets were as locals escaped the heat for holiday elsewhere. The Strada Nuovo museums were included in the price of this walking tour (which I highly recommend)",
          "Located on the Strada Nuova (Via Garibaldi), a UNESCO World Heritage Site and home to some magnificent Renaissance and Baroque palaces. Companion to the Palazzo Rosso across the street, this museum has a wonderful collection of 16th-18th European art including Lippi's St",
          "Nice museum on an extraordinary street, Strada Nuova, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Went up to the top floor where there is an apartment used by a former director of the museums. While there the guard motioned us to an elevator which went up to the roof. Once up there, we were",
          "It distresses me that the Galleria di Palazzo Blanco (Gallery of the White Palace) is rated so low on TA, as it\u2019s really one of the most important museums and finest palaces in the city with excellent art! See my extensive review below for the notable collection of art,",
          "Ask to be taken by elevator to the top floor, then climb the rickety metal stairs to the crow's nest and be rewarded with the best view of Genoa available!",
          "This is a must do in Genova. Top tip: buy your ticket from the book and gift shop opposite. Use the lift in the palace to get out onto the roof. You will need about 1.5 hours minimum to do the palace justice. The ground floor cafe is good.",
          "Given the rather ordinary unassuming streetscape for this palace, our expectations were really quite modest. What a delightful experience! The entry fee of \u20ac6 pp included two less impressive palaces, but this one blew us away. Interior was amazing mix of elegant rooms,",
          "Just a sort stroll from the Square of Ferrari (centre of town), down a narrow, cobbled street filled with quaint food shops, delis etc and you'll find Palazzo Rosso with wonderful art works from the Renaissance etc. Yes I know, I'm no artist but it's well worth a visit!",
          "Palazzo Bianco is one of the Palazzi dei Rolli along the Strada Nuova. It along with Palazzo Ross across the Strada. It is a very well laid out museum with a garden on the first floor. There is a lift but only from the first floor. It is well worth spending some time here.",
          "Galleria di Palazzo Rosso Via Garibaldi 18. This is one of three Palazzi on Via Garibaldi that have been extensively renovated and turned into museums. The one ticket covers all three -this one and - Palazzo Bianco (Via Garibaldi 11), Doria Tursi (Via Garibaldi 9). The",

          "Palazzo Rosso is one of three Palaces converted to a museum on Via Garibaldi, the UNESCO World Heritage Street. The museum mixes paintings with sculpture, furniture and tapestry in some beautifully restored frescoed rooms. The museum is open Tues-Friday 9A-7P and Sat/Sun from"

          "Dating back to the early 1600\u2019s when it was built for the Balbi family (subsequently owned and expanded by a succession of families), this massive home contains countless original items such as paintings, tapestries, furniture, sculptures, etc. The numerous rooms are decorated",
          "If you have the opportunity to visit Genoa at ROLLI days, don't forget to visit this wonderful palace. As the other builfings at Via Garibaldi you will find marvelous paintings on the ceilings and the Windows room is just wonderful to see.",
          "First of all, we loved genoa! We were on a 4h free walking tour with Spyros from hostel Manena and he showed us an amazing city. That said, Palazzo Reale did not disappointed us and had a lot of history to show, as the whole city does. I was specially thrilled with the warming",
          "We went to Museo Palazzo Reale Di Genova on one rainy Monday morning in November. We went in and there was no one at the ticket office. The palace garden was in front of us so we went in and took a look at the garden. The garden and terrace is not big. We can see the harbour",
          "Very beautiful palace, gorgeous rooms and the terrace from which you can see the city and the port. The entrance is 6 euros.",
          "The Royal Palace is a must-see stop on your travels through Genoa. Every room was still intricately designed and gorgeous. My friend and I were traveling on a tight budget and this was a cheap stop, worth every penny.",
          "This classy palace was built between 1618-1655 for Balbi family. It's 5 mintutes walk from the Piazza Principe (train station) but you can take a bus (20, 32, 34, 35), too. It's difficult to take a good photo outside. Inside you can see original furniture and decoration,",
          "The visit costs 6\u20ac for an adult but I found when I got there that since I am under 25 it actually cost me 2\u20ac! You can visit the second story of the Palazzo with its \"original\" interiors (combination of different eras and some decorations/furniture removed), walls covered in art",
          "The Royal Palace is beautiful and well worth a visit. The entry fee is relatively small, especially for the quality of the art and architecture.",
          "We were forunate to be visiting the city when the palaces are open to the public for free.The hall of mirrors is magnificent",
          "Genoa was very important for the old King Savoia. This Palace was a luxury building close to the sea and the harbour, still very rich. You will be surprised by the fornitures.",
          "We loved this palace! You can see so much. The furniture of the times, the art and the gorgeous frescos. How beautiful. They also have explanations in English in each room. Very good.",
          "Opening hours are a little eccentric, but this is well worth a visit. The palace rooms are spectacular, in particular the long mirrored gallery, and there are great views to the port.",
          "Only one floor available to see but what a floor, beautiful painted ceilings, a throne room, the bedrooms were well done. Just imagined seeing kings and queens",
          "GORGEOUS historic palace with several paintings, Chinese porcelain, and original textiles. Pay attention to the floors and ceilings, which are also works of art. This museum also offers special exhibits worth seeing.",
          "We only had an hour at the museum and it was time and money well spent. The museum was relatively empty and overwhelming beautiful. The grandeur of each room was breathtaking. With multiple rooms that lead onto each other I think I could have easily spent a few hours here.",
          "Lovely Palace over-looking the port. Wonderful chandeliers in every room. Hall of Mirrors is a must. Great views from the terrace.",
          "Was unsure whether I could be bothered - but this was a real surprise and totally full of history and stunning period furniture - the highlight was the Palor of Mirrors and the roof top outside deck. Highly recommended - just see the pix below!",
          "Although the self guided tour only covers a small part of this building, the furnishings, wall and ceiling decorations and art work are extra ordinary. Well worth the entry fee.",
          "Worth a visit. The mirrors room is quite amazing. It's also very interesting to follow the history of the palace, since its beginnings to this days.",
          "Quite reasonable to get in at 6 Euros. Not a lot of rooms to visit and most are very dark. After visiting palaces and museums in other Italian Cities I found this very bland and not very exciting",

          "We had read in a guide book that the hall of mirrors here rivaled that of Versailles. Not even close. If you happen to be stuck in Genoa and need to kill time, this is an okay sight. All of the information about what you are viewing is in Italian. You can only view the top",
          "This is a Must See Museum in Genoa! The entrance fee was only 6 euros, which is a very good price for such a beautiful museum.",
          "This is a stunning place. Check opening times as they close early on a Friday. Rooms are amazing especially the throne room and the gallery of mirrors. The outside terraces are also worth a look. How the other half lived!!",

          "The Museum consists of many rooms decorated and furnished with furniture of the XVIII and XIX centuries of the Savoy Dynasty. Very beautiful are the Mirror Gallery and the Chapel Gallery. Be sure to see the Throne Room, the Reception Hall and the Dance Hall, as well as",
          "We enjoyed everything about it. Easy to do on your own and at your own pace. The ceilings were incredible.",
          "One of the most amazing palaces I have seen. A definate wow factor. The room of mirrors made Versailles look tacky. Helpful staff let us use the lift.",
          "This is an excellent example of past grandeur, really brings the past alive Very good value, well worth a visit.",
          "Such a shame that a beautiful palazzo like this has no audio guide. Yes, there are signs with descriptions in each room, but they are rather poor and the writing is very small. My tip, google it and read about its history before visiting it.",
          "Just been to this amazing place and Wow. It\u2019s just soooo beautiful and nothing I say can do it justice. The cost of entry is very reasonable at just \u20ac6 for adults (under 18s are free, bonus!) It\u2019s so stunning .... definitely visit",

          "This was the palace that all the others in Genoa had to measure up to....and none of them did! This palace has a good chunk of rooms restored. From what we were told they are working on more. If you want to see glitz and glam the way the Genoese royals lived, this is the one.",
          "There are apparently over 80 Palazzo\u2019s in Genoa and each one I am sure are stunning. The Reale Palazzo is no exception. Well appointed rooms of the period. Interesting that the beds are so small given the size of rooms. Room of mirrors is a must see.",
          "This palace has one of the greatest collections of art in Europe. It cost practically nothing to see it, but allow plenty of time, if you want to see it all. The shop has some great souvenirs.",
          "This royal palace is the highlight of the UNESCO Rolli Palaces. There are royal residences, lots of drawings rooms all decorated in the style of the period and the fantastic Hall of Mirrors which is a miniature version of the Great Hall of Mirrors in Versailles, France.",
          "This is one of the many wonderful museums where you rarely encounter anyone else but the attendants who check your ticket. The palace has been restored with great care and bears a superbe collection of paintings, sculpture and furniture from XVI to XVIII century in an exquisite",
          "Really beautiful, definitely worth the \u00a35 entry. The staff are really helpful and happy to answer any questions you have.",
          "I loved the place, the oppulence, the good vibes, the polite and kind staff. The ticket was about 6 euros and you could take as much photos as you wanted, without flash. Very clean and well mainainted, it traps you into history. If in Genova, you need to visit!",
          "So much opulence, so much grandeur, blocked from a harbour view by a newish building. So much of the building is now offices or bare. It was lovely to be able to imagine the past but also slightly sad that there is so little left. The garden was advertised as costing extra but",
          "We were fortunate enough to be in town during one of the Rolli days when many palaces and churches are open to the public for free. This particular palace was our favourite with an excellent selection of sculpture and art displayed in delightful room settings",
          "Beautiful doesn't cover the opulence of this wonderful museum, artifacts, decor and its gardens. Built in the 17th Century by the Balbi family, the series of rooms reveal the most spectacular decorations from a time long gone by. If you want a snapshot of how Genovese royalty",
          "Really worth a visit, rooms are wonderfully painted in the Genoa style, furniture and paintings are of the period.",
          "6 euros to get in, this palace has some wonderful ceilings to admire with beautiful floors in marble & wood made by a English man. There are many fine pictures. The throne room in something not to miss and is the glass room made in the style of Versailles. Some nice views from",
          "It certainly gave you a view of how people in Genoa lived many years ago. In it's day it must have been a majestic palace. Worth the tour if you have the time. The painting on the ceiling and walls were amazing.",
          "If you resist the temptation to visit every palazzo in Genoa - not a problem for us - and do only one, then this is possibly 'the one'. Everything you could wish for in gaudy glitz; nothing understated. Great views and a pretty little garden.",
          "Museum was nice with informative English language signs in each room. That being said, I found the visit a little underwhelming. There is massive unrealized potential (like the city as a whole). Pictures of the garden look beautiful, but the reality is a small square limited in",
          "The palace was originally build by Genovese aristocracy, but was sold to the Royal family of Savoy in the 1820's. The royal family used it as their residence when staying in Genova. The palazzo is famous for it's beautiful \"hall of mirrors\". It will take you about one hour to",
          "The Reale will not be the biggest European home you visit but a stroll through the rooms and small gardens are definitely worth the 6 euro entry. The highlight is the splendid glass gallery. NOTE ABOUT ACCESS - the public rooms are four longish flights of marble steps up from",
          "Well worth a visit. The art and architecture on display was a real surprise. We thoroughly enjoyed wandering around the different rooms and reading the informative descriptions. In midweek it is quiet so you can walk round at your own pace.",
          "Only the third floor has rooms with furniture but the smaller copy of the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles and so many variations on the design of chandeliers in different rooms are superb. It contains many frescoed rooms, though some look in need of tlc. Great panoramic views",
          "This building is splendid although the stairs to reach the entrance are pretty steep! Each room is more splendid than the last with gold leaf in abundance. Well worth a saunter around.",
          "On Via Balbi in the City, this place is an architectural gem. About 6 euro admission and well worth it. You could spend hours in here. The rooms and many of the paintings/ exhibits are described on information cards in English, enabling an understanding of each. Out on the",
          "If your time is limited but you want to visit a museum and a church, these are the ones to choose. Only minutes away from Principe train station with the entrances on Via Balbi they are easily accessible. The Museo Reale is exquisite especially the Hall of Mirrors and the",
          "MdPR look like quite ordinary old building in Genoa. It it much more! I had two really eager, nice and polite guides to tell secrets of every wonderful room I saw. Thanks again young students, I still remember you! I spent in MdPR one hour and the time was pure historical",
          "I\u2019m not over the moon with the museums in Genoa, but that\u2019s because I\u2019m spoiled with seeing all the museums in Rome and Florence, which is hard to compare to... Palazzo Reale was worth a visit. Nicely and luxurious decorated rooms. Quite small though, took me less than half an",
          "I had a couple of hours to kill before my train so I decided to stop here. The gallery was pretty and I was one of four people there so it was intimate and calm. The courtyard is adorable too! Definitely recommend this place if you have a little bit of time and want a chill",
          "Many of the palaces which door the old City have been converted into museums,banks, universities, residences and the like. This one has been perfect do one can see how the other half lived hundreds of years ago. It is ornately designed with numerous sculptures and paintings",
          "This is quite an imposing building, but in need of some TLC. Some of the rooms are very interesting and well worth a visit, whist outside the air is of a building in need of investment. I am no advocate of makeovers, but some tidying up is in order, to complement the aspects",
          "We visited this palace in the main street, VIA Balbi and were not disappointed. A small entrance fee and time to see all the rooms on display. ( also has a coffee shop attached ). Magnificent property beautifully maintained within a short walk from the main train station.",
          "The Royal Palace is an imposing building in Genoa. It contains a large number of frescoed rooms, as well as many valuable paintings and furniture. First used as a nobleman's residence, it became the seat of the Savoy Kings. The most impressive room is the Hall of Mirrors,",
          "We only had 30 mins here,but it was beautiful. It was free no sure if it is normally. There was actors dressed up which was great",
          "Though beautiful, but it would help if there is english alongside the italian explanations. There is restoration work taking place but it certainly need more. It is worth the visit. \u20ac6 per adult",
          "Seen from the Via Balbi, the Palazzo Reale looks pretty impressive. In reality, it is full of masses of instantly forgettable art. The Hall of Mirrors does, at least, help to break the monotony. There are, however, impressive views of the palace from the terrace, and a view",
          "This palazzo isn't about art, this palazzo is about the layout of a palazzo as you walk through the upstairs rooms, and the small garden at the back.",
          "Thus far this has been the most spectacular exhibit I've visited. The mirror room is breathtaking. The outdoor area is very nice too",
          "Having seen the Palazzo Rosso - the most delicious peak into well-off urban genovese life in the 16th century - this is the Season 2: next century.",
          "Located on the Piano Nobile, the museum comprises a series of elegant rooms decorated and furnished in the 18th century by the Durazzo family and in the 19th century by the Savoys.",
          "The ballroom is really spectacular. The rest of the pace, less so. However if you are in Genoa, make sure you do not miss it.",
          "The decoration is over the top and quite impressive. I had a nice time there and really liked the mirror room and the garden. I like the outside of the building as much as the inside, I think.",
          "After a month in Italy, I was becoming blind to the grandeur and beauty of its art and architecture. This place is full of that but reawakened me to the stunning brilliance of it all. There's a gilded hall of mirrors that I'd suggest is likely to widen the most tired of eyes and",
          "Nice big house with a bit of History behind it with a view of the docks. Has some interesting art inside too. Get the 24hr museum pass to make it worthwhile as you can get access, and complete, several of these types of palace/houses in the same day.",
          "Great palace. Huge grand stairs. Elevator for disabled people. Wonderful to look down from terrace to a fountain with courtyard, covered in mystical animals.",
          "The palace is in a side street (or appeared to be) and there was hardly any tourists there at all we bought our ticket and were left alone to go through the palace with our map as a guide. Some of the rooms are fantastic and are reminiscent of rooms in Versailles (just",
          "Nice visit for a day spent differently, however don't expect anything too exciting! Gardens are beautiful, some of the interiors are definitely worth a visit - ticket prices are reasonable too.",

          "I still haven't sorted out the very complicated history of Genoa after being here three days, but it seems this was a royal palace since 1823 after having been the private home of extremely rich people since being built in the 1600's. (And then sold to the State.). The rooms are",

          "We came here on our honeymoon right before a cruise and this palazzo is the only thing we managed to do. It was great in every aspect. Beautiful, interesting and we were lucky enough to have high school students explain the exhibits as we went along (they were doing some sort of",
          "Very interesting palace with plenty to see. The view from the terrace is not bad. Also the terrace is the best place to actually get a good look at the facade.",

          "The entrance belies what is hidden up the several flight of marble stairs... (There is a lift available but you have to ask). Well worth the 4 Euros for the ticket. The sumptuous rooms of centuries passed are fascinating. Have a look for the almost hidden doors in the wall,",
          "Visited this as a free roil day and it was an interesting diversion. It consists of a series of rooms containg furniture/paintings from its previous existence as a royal palace.",
          "This is a lovely Museum. We had a hard time finding it and once in the courtyard the directions to continue upstairs were confused or missing. We followed where another couple were coming from and found it. The staff at the entry ignored us but once upstairs the ladies were",
          "Not many visitors in this amazing palace - the mirrored room is a mini Versailles and fantastic. A real must see.",
          "A museum, a historic palace, a garden and an art gallery. This complex features original furniture, frescoes and a beautiful facade. Built in 1618 for the Balbi family the museum is very well maintained. A great place to while away a few hours - just so much to see and do - lots",
          "The kind of opulence demonstrated in this kind of palazzo always seems to offend my Sense of fairness. Not that there weren't such inequalities elsewhere among Bourbons, Borgias, Tudors, and American robber barons. Not to be missed and great photo op for \u20ac4.2",
          "We went to the museum this afternoon as it is only a few minutes walk from our hotel. It was only \u20ac4 each to go in. There are quite a lot of stairs to go up and then they check your ticket. I started to go one way but was told to go the other way round. I can't see why that was",
          "I paid for the ticket and did not enter!!!! So lousy with no introduction or information about the rules. They even try not to let you in if you do not have change!!",
          "This was the very best of attractions to visit in Genova. Can't believe that they have lived house like this one. Also very cheap attraction. Worth of every penny.",
          "This one is OK. Ultra opulent rooms but, if short of time, I'd rather visit palazzi Bianco, Rosso, Tursi and Spinola for their impressive art.",
          "I believe it was just 5E for entry. Need to charge more to apply to maintenance. Can only imagine the parties they threw with the view of the port from the 3rd floor patios.",
          "Best place I visited in Genova, a must see ! It was very cheap to visit. I got there when it opened which is perfect so you get to take pictures before it gets busy.",
          "We stumbled upon the palazzo as it was near our hotel, and were delighted to find it cost just \u20ac2 for under 26s! We wandered around the beautiful rooms of the palace and saw some awe-inspiring paintings and sculptures. The galleria is stunning, with amazing marbles statues -",
          "Fascinating if you are interested in Roman mythology and the renaissance period. Some rooms beautifully restored, others with cracked mirrors and paint chipped but adds to the history and charm of it. Lovely ornate rooms with English translations but you have to dig through the",
          "Definitely recommend this Museum for visit .So amazing , and beautiful! Tickets are 4\u20ac for adults (26+) , and for kids 11-25 is 2\u20ac .Great place !",
          "This was one of the most beautiful places in Genoa that I have seen. The palace is a great piece of art in itself. Its architecture is beautiful and the decorated ceilings, walls, etc. are all beautiful. Unforunately it was a long walk and we had a boring guide take us through",
          "Beautiful museum with lots of paintings to look at. We took a tour that took us to four different museums. We enjoyed all the paintings.",
          "Fantastic palace! I tried to imagine the life of a woman living in that place and time.... Many well preserved furnished in period, large rooms and outdoor area. Informational cards in each room in different languages explaining decor and crediting each item found within. Well",
          "This building truly is a bit of a hidden gem. When you go in you honestly do feel as if you have gone back a couple of centuries as the rooms have been kept pretty much as they were then, really fascinating. There is also the possibility to walk around the terrace roof area to",
          "So close to our hotel and beautifu interior rooms and courtyard.you can walk around the terrace roof area for good views . Definitely worth a visit .all in Italian and no English guide book offered .",
          "As soon as you enter the palace, you will have a feeling as if you went back to the 17th-18th century because the rooms were kept intact as they were then. The decorations are rich and beautiful. The labels are in English language as well. Recommend visiting!!!",
          "All palacios I visited, this is my favorite ( Palazzo Reale Genoa Italy ) It is one of the most important historical buildings in the city of Genoa, Italy. In July 2006 it was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Today it is a museum consisting of the historic residence,",
          "This palace and museum was built in the 1600s and redeveloped over time. It has 18 rooms open to the public, all of which are phenomenal. It takes about an hour to tour and is very much worth it.",
          "We went to the museum on a Saturday afternoon just to find out it was closed. It was so frustrating after flying from Rome for this visit. We were told it would reopen on Sunday afternoon, but we would have left Genova by then.",
          "The room of Mirrors should not be missed it is beyond beautiful, all you can do is imagine the sumptuous dinners that once took place here.",
          "This is a gem, a kind of little Versailles hidden in the Old City and overlooking the busy port. The surroundings and entrance-fa\u00e7ade are not so great, but the palace itself is just amazing, you cannot miss it.",
          "The palace has a very nice atmosphere, the entrance fee is very small, there were not a lot of people. You can admire in silence and get a nice vibe. The mirrors hall it's really beautiful!",
          "Maybe I got spoiled with all the palaces in Italy, but I found this place just OK. Big rooms with paintings and sculptures. I saw better than this in Italy. No information in English in the rooms so maybe you should read before you come or get a guide if you're veryinterested.",
          "Very friendly little palace, in the center of the city. Nicely decorated rooms, ornamental ceilings, large terraces overlooking the port. Worth a visit.",
          "The royal palace is situated more or less where old historical city start and its a great way to get introduced to the city and get an understanding of a time, when Genova and Savoy were power players on the European scene. The palace is beautiful and a mix of different time",

          "Many museums we visit are good and few are great, This one is GREAT! We pay close attention to detail of wall frescos, ceiling art, furniture, sculptures, light fixtures, paintings and floors. As much of our surrounding as we can while taking it all in. In my opinion, there are",
          "If you have a chance to go to one museum in Genoa go to Palazzo Reale on via Balbi. It has a rococo style interior beautiful ballroom and Hall of mirrors. The garden sloping to the old port has a beautiful view and cobblestone mosaic around a central fountain with lilies.",
          "Not far from the train station. The entrance fee was around 4 euro. The museum was open for viewing on the top floor. Lavishly decorated. There were some information on each room in various languages including English. Photos were allowed. Overall, we enjoyed the visit.",
          "The guy on the main desk spoke very little English (not his fault I speak very little Italian) and you have to pay in cash and there was a struggle over change and there wasn't a plan of the palace or a guide book - oh well it all looks a bit amateur but it was only four euros.",
          "This is a good example of the Italian Palaces. Well worth visiting but beware that they ONLY accept cash and will NOT accept euro50 notes. You must also deposit your backpacks and bags in a locker before entering the actual Palace. This is after you pay and no mention is made",
          "The grand palazzo of the Via Balbi were built for the great merchant families, but through the processes of dynastic decline this one became avaliable to the Savoy family when they took the Italian throne. Already it was fit for a King. Although it has features modelled on the",

          "Stunning place with lots of wonderfully decorated and furnished rooms with imposing artwork. 4 \u20ac entrance fee per person well worth it with many rooms to visit. One place to take your time and feel the history.",
          "We knew all museums in Italy are closed on Mondays. So we planned our trip in that way to get to this museum on Sunday. But when we came the museum was closed, and for the same price they offered us to visit apartment of royal family and a garden. Exposition is so poor we were",
          "A great place to while away a few hours - just so much to see and do - lots of exhibits and not many people there, so plenty of time to view in peace and quiet. The Italian classical style is ornate and over-done by many tastes - but the craftsmanship and talent is evident at",
          "There is so much to look at in the Royal Palace. Every wall and ceiling is an art piece in their own. The extravaganze is just overwhelming. Every room has several fantastic paintings in them, if you want, you can walk around for hours just looking at art. For 4 euros, this is",
          "Only 4\u20ac per person for the visit. Gone through about 20 rooms in the palace. Each room is well preserved and photography is allowed so long no flash is used. There are English description cards at the back of the description plate in every room. We took our time to read",
          "The palace is okay, however it is much smaller than I expected. There are som descriprions in every room but it might be a better experience with a guide. Left the building with an \"okay what's next\"-feeling. Not disappointed, but as I said just Okay.",

          "I loved this beautiful old Palazzo. Very easy to get around, a tick give you free run of a single floor of this grand home, occupied by three great Genoese families over the years. And I especially loved that the original art and furniture is still in place, and that you can",
          "As on of the Palazzo Rolli, this gives you quite an idea what the visiting dignitaries could have expected on their visit to Genova. The hall of mirrors alone is worth the visit. Easy to while away a couple of hours wondering from room to room and in the gardens. The massive",

          "Really had a very ambiguous impression from Genova at first! We arrived at the evening, went out at night and saw all the goodies of a port city with a very obvious consequences of being such. I didn't like it at all. But then next day we went out with the day light, it was",
          "This attraction was well worth the price. The decadence on display is amazing. The hall of mirrors is captivating and certainly the highlight, but there are other gems inside as well.",
          "This is not a huge palace but it has some beautiful rooms (particularly the mirror room), and many of the paintings are well worth seeing. We went in the morning and it was quiet; being alone in the space gives you time to look at the detail and enjoy the atmosphere. You are",
          "This is a lovely palace in Genoa and well worth visiting. We were there on the first Sunday of the month and so entry was free (usually 5EUR). The rooms are beautiful and well presented. As other reviewers have mentioned - the mirror room and the private chapels are",
          "One of the most beautiful palaces I have ever visited. Every single room you walk into is just absolutely breathtaking. One after the other just gets better. The price for this Palace is 4e which is more than worth it. You must visit this place when in Genoa.",
          "Well worth a visit - splendid rooms are well presented. The hall of mirrors is breathtaking. Don't miss the rooftop terrace.",
          "I agree with your reviewer Caroline T. From the terrace I imagine the wealthy viewing their ships being unloaded. They certainly \"lived over the shop\" in those days! I missed the mirrored room first time around and had to retrace my steps, thank goodness I did.",
          "Only the top floor is open, but watch the video before you walk around the rooms - its well worth it. Make sure you visit the Terrace too.",
          "The best view of the palace is from the terrace which you can reach once within the palace. It also has pretty decent collection of paintings, furniture",
          "In what is kind of considered a dumpy city, there is rich deep history of art, commerce, and the birth of the imagination that led to the founding of the new land across the expanse of water that floated Christopher Columbus to the New World. What makes this Palazzo unique is",
          "A gorgeous old building in Genoa. You must visit it if you go there. It's just breathtaking, so much art and some rooms were unbelievable, such as the mirror room. Unfortunately I couldn't visit the garden as there was a bad weather but I've been told that it is worth visiting!",
          "The art work is on the top floors so if that's what you want, go straight up there otherwise you will spend hours going through the palace rooms which are interesting but the artwork is rather heavy going.",
          "One of the highlights of our stay in Genoa was a visit to the Museo di Palazzo Reale. Construction of the Palazzo began in 1618 and was enlarged after being bought by the Durazzo family in 1677. The entire second floor of the palazzo is open to the public, including the very",

          "If you have some time to spare in Genoa, this is well worth a visit. They have a short film at the beginning of the visit, in English, to give you a background history of the Palace. The Guides are very friendly & speak English well enough to answer any queries & were",
          "We happened upon this furnished palace going from our hotel wandering into old town Genoa. I like to see the wall coverings, elaborate furniture, floors, drapes, paintings, lighting... Not just a big empty palace! And this place had it all! Starting with the carriage in the",
          "I visited this museum while my husband back in February. My husband had to work so I toured the city during my free time. I chose this place using Trip Advisor and it was the a great choice. It is one of the most beautiful palaces that I have seen in all of Europe. It also",
          "Firstly we walked in to look at the gardens and we were offered free entry to the museum. Actually we were walking around filling in time. What a magnificent find! It reminded us of the palace of Versailles and even had a spectacular hall of mirrors. The decoration and artworks",
          "We enjoyed this Museum. It has a relaxed air, the attendants do not fuss as you walk among the richly decorated rooms, with costly furnishings, able to enjoy the house as it was to some extent in the 19thc. There are bedrooms, a throne room, reception rooms and an impressive",
          "The hall of mirrors is \"lite\" version of Versailles hall with same name. But you can easily see it without huge crowds (that's nearly to impossible in Versallies). Only you and mirrors... Other parts of palace also worth to visit but less impressive.",
          "Loved the decor and the history of the palace Only 4 euros to get in the room of mirrors is well worth a visit",

          "The rooms are stunning, well preserved and have detail cards of all the items and paintings inside them. The king's balcony is enormous and you get a good view of the sea. The one thing I did not like was that the tour guide was all over us. I had to tell him several times to",
          "This is one place that must be visited in Genoa. It was the home of the Kings of Sardinia and their relatives. It is truly stunning and full of beautiful furniture and ceramics and French clocks.",
          "This was a fabulous palace if you are into the Rococo period. I loved it but my friend found it \"tacky\" only because she likes sleek places. Being it was November, there weren't many people there. It was a bit difficult to find the ticket booth - you have to walk up the red",
          "We have been coming back to our hotel after visiting three other museums and a long walk around the port and historical center. We are so glad that we have not chickened out:) It is a really a precious experience when you visit rooms in their former glory and so well preserved",
          "Via Balbi, on which the museum stands, is one of the most dirtiest streets I've ever seen in Genova. It is indeed a shame to have a royal palace in such a neighborhood. Moreover, the palace/museum itself makes an impression that it has never been cleaned up! If not the great",
          "Magic. Firstly, unlike us, visit on the right day. Check that the Palace is actually open in advance. We got it right, second time! When we visited it was hot, very hot. If you don't want to visit the \"museum\" - Italian for beautifully preserved rooms - you can enter the",

          "This is an absolutely stunning and beautifully preserved piece of Genova's rich history. The mirror room is stunning, worth paying the entrance fee for that alone, as it's like a miniature Versailles. There are helpful information cards in each room in English and Italian, and",
          "The Royal Palace is very close to the station (appr. 5 minutes walking downhill) and might not seem magnificent from the outside. But it is absolutely worth a visit! It displays original furniture that belonged to the wealthy families that inhabited it and you can also see the",
          "a little tired looking from the outside but stunning inside! Pay to go inside as it's well worth the 4 euros. Staff very attentive and cards in English in each room. There is a lift which isn't clearly marked from outside but it's 4 stairways to get to the 2nd floor entrance so",

          "The palace is simply amazing, and so well restored/preserved. The entrance was only 2E, and it was definitely worth it! Unfortunately no photos are allowed, and we were unable to get a guide who spoke English, but it was still definitely worth seeing. Such elaborate interiors",
          "This was a gorgeous attraction, it is well located right near the station. Everything was so well preserved and there was lots of information provided. was well worth the 4Euro entry fee!",
          "Tips: get a guide who speaks a language you know, otherwise you will miss a lot! The Palace is wonderful and gets you back in time. Though, they do not allow to take photos. Quite a shame!",

          "Amazing Palazzo! Cheap to get in, we were taken on a tour where they had boards telling you something about each room. Translations were available in French, Italian, English. The Savoy family once lived here so as you can imaging it is very sumptuous & has such a tangible",
          "You'll be impressed by the furnishings here, though it can be interesting to see the difficulties of living in that time even for the very rich. You can only go through as part of a tour, though the guide doesn't present but just keeps everyone together. Information is presented",

          "Seeing the inside of the palace with all its art and architecture was nice (I love the intricately carved wooden door designes), but I would say the outside is worth a visit too (& free)."

          "The towers and old walls are interesting to see and makes for nice photographs. There are quite a few restaurants in the area if you want to spend more time.",
          "Nice view and that is it. Price for the towers is too much, 5 euros, and you can only enter at a certain time. The view is not worth the money, and the towers look better from outside anyway. If you have some extra money go and see it, but do not expect much ;) .",

          "My small town has more interesting medieval towers. Really average for any town, was expecting more.",
          "It is a gate leading to nothing, as I went there the gate may have been majestic and old but I would only recommend this gate to history lovers as it is not exciting at all. As much as I love Genoa I unfortunately must give this 2 stars as a gate like this one should either lead",
          "The total time on porta soprana and Christopher Colombus house was 20 minutes. You buy the tickets at Colmbus house. Porta soprana house opens at 11:30. Employee must accompany you to the top.",

          "Walking through the narrow, winding side streets just beyond the gates gives one the feeling of what it might have been when Christopher Columbus likely walked among these cobblestones. Fascinating architecture. Grab an espresso and sit and watch the locals.",
          "The Torri di Porta Soprana is one of the more recognizable places in the city and the last remains of the city's medieval fortifications. These twin towers show how strong Genoa's pimp game was, demonstrating their wealth by surrounding the entire port city with this kind of",

          "During our stay in Genova, our apartment was close to the tower called Porta Soprano. We visited the tower and learned about its history. Since the 9th Century, Genova has been defended by walls. Over centuries, the walls have been expanded and had different names. The first",
          "This is the tallest city gate I've seen so far. It's on a pedestrian street, and you get to walk through it. Not sure if you can visit/go on top of the arch. It's right next to Colombo's birth house.",
          "Genoa city centre is a fascinating mix of very old and dramatic buildings, and so it is nice that amongst everything, this very imposing ancient gateway should be in tact as a reminder of yesteryear, and when you walk uphill and through the gateway be sure to look to one side to",
          "On the edge of the old city and right next to Christopher Columbus house. Interesting construction.Like all the old buildings in Genoa in a good state of repair - wouldn't be a must see for me, passed it on a walk to the Museum of Modern Art. Walk round and have a look at it",
          "Twin 12th century semi-circular towers once served as one of the gateways to Genoa. Significant portions of city were walled to prevent attack ( especially from the French). This gateway stands on the spot of an old road that meandered from Rome to here.",
          "I visited this as it was part of the ticket of the house of Colombus. It was quite frightening to go up there as it feels very unsafe. The stairs are very steep, and the tower is old. However, the view is incredible. You get a 360 view of Genoa.",
          "One of the old gates to the walled city. Two towers stand tall, but this part of the wall is more interesting than the others as its very close to the alleged house of Christopher Columbus and also the ruins of the cloister of St. Andrew. Worth walking through, although the",

        "wiki": "Catherine of Genoa (Caterina Fieschi Adorno, 1447 \u2013 15 September 1510) was an Italian Roman Catholic saint and mystic, admired for her work among the sick and the poor and remembered because of various writings describing both these actions and her mystical experiences. She was a member of the noble Fieschi family, and spent most of her life and her means serving the sick, especially during the plague which ravaged Genoa in 1497 and 1501.  She died in that city in 1510.\nHer fame outside her native city is connected with the publication in 1551 of the book known in English as the Life and Doctrine of Saint Catherine of Genoa.She and her teaching were the subject of Baron Friedrich von H\u00fcgel's classic work The Mystical Element of Religion (1908).\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCatherine was born in Genoa in 1447, the last of five children.\nCatherine's parents were Jacopo Fieschi and Francesca di Negro, both of illustrious Italian birth. The family was connected to two previous popes, and Jacopo became Viceroy of Naples.Catherine wished to enter a convent when about 13, perhaps inspired by her sister Limbania who was an Augustinian nun. However, the nuns to whom her confessor applied on her behalf refused her on account of her youth, and after this Catherine  appears to have put the idea aside without any further attempt. After her father\u2019s death in 1463, aged 16, she was married by her parents' wish to a young Genoese nobleman, Giuliano Adorno, a man who, after several experiences in the area of trade and in the military world in the Middle East, had returned to Genoa to get married. Their marriage was probably a ploy to end the feud between their two families. The marriage turned out wretchedly: it was  childless and Giuliano proved to be faithless, violent-tempered and a spendthrift, and he made his wife's life a misery. Details are scant, but it seems at least clear that Catherine spent the first five years of her marriage in silent, melancholy submission to her husband; and that she then, for another five years, turned a little to the world for consolation in her troubles. Then, after ten years of marriage, desperate for an escape, she prayed for three months that God would keep her sick in bed, but her prayer went unanswered.\n\n\n== Conversion ==\nAfter ten years of marriage,  she was converted by a mystical experience during confession on 22 March 1473; her conversion is described as an overpowering sense of God's love for her. After this revelation occurred, she abruptly left the church, without finishing her confession. This marked the beginning of her life of close union with God in prayer, without using forms of prayer such as the rosary. She began to receive Communion almost daily, a practice extremely rare for lay people in the Middle Ages, and she underwent remarkable mental and at times almost pathological experiences, the subject of Friedrich von H\u00fcgel's study The Mystical Element of Religion.She combined this with unselfish service to the sick in a hospital at Genoa, in which her husband joined her after he, too, had been converted. He later became a Franciscan tertiary, but she joined no religious order. Her husband's spending had ruined them financially. He and Catherine decided to live in the Pammatone, a large hospital in Genoa, and to dedicate themselves to works of charity there.  She eventually became manager and treasurer of the hospital.She died on 15 September 1510, worn out with labours of body and soul. Her death had been slow with many days of pain and suffering as she experienced visions and wavered between life and death.\n\n\n== Spiritual teaching ==\nFor about 25 years, Catherine, though frequently going to confession, was unable to open her mind for direction to anyone; but towards the end of her life a Father Marabotti was appointed to be her spiritual guide. He had been a director of the hospital where her husband died in 1497. To him she explained her states, past and present, and he compiled the Memoirs. During this period, her life was devoted to her relationship with God, through \"interior inspiration\" alone.In 1551, 41 years after her death, a book about her life and teaching was published, entitled Libro de la vita mirabile et dottrina santa de la Beata Caterinetta de Genoa (\"Book of the marvellous life and holy teaching of the Blessed Catherine of Genoa\"). This is the source of her \"Dialogues on the Soul and the Body\" and her \"Treatise on Purgatory\", which are often printed separately. Her authorship of these has been denied, and it used to be thought that another mystic, the Augustinian canoness regular Battistina Vernazza, a nun who lived in a monastery in Genoa from 1510 till her death in 1587, had edited the two works. This suggestion is now discredited by recent scholarship, which attributes a large part of both works to Catherine, even though they received their final literary form only after her death.Catherine's thought on purgatory, for which she is particularly known, and her way of describing it, is original in some features for the period.\n\n\n== Beatification and canonization ==\nCatherine's writings were examined by the Holy Office and declared to contain doctrine that would alone be enough to prove her sanctity, and she was accordingly beatified in 1675 by Pope Clement X, and canonized in 1737 by Pope Clement XII. Her writings also became sources of inspiration for other religious leaders such as Robert Bellarmine and Francis de Sales and Cardinal Henry Edward Manning.\nCatherine of Genoa's liturgical feast is celebrated in local calendars on 15 September. Pope Pius XII declared her patroness of the hospitals in Italy.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nChristian mysticism\nList of Catholic saints\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

        "wiki": "The Villa Durazzo-Pallavicini is a villa with notable 19th-century park in the English romantic style and a small botanical garden. The villa now houses the Museo di Archeologia Ligure, and is located at Via Pallavicini 13, immediately next to the railway station in Pegli, a suburb of Genoa, Italy. The park and botanical garden are open daily.\nThe estate was begun in the late 17th century by Clelia Durazzo Grimaldi, who established the Giardino botanico Clelia Durazzo Grimaldi at that time. Today's park was created by her nephew Ignazio Alessandro Pallavicini after he inherited the property.\nThe park was designed by Michele Canzio, set designer for the Teatro Carlo Felice, and built between 1840 and 1846. It covers some 97,000 m\u00b2 of hillside behind the villa. Although recognizably in the English romantic style, the garden is highly theatrical, to the point of being organized as a series of scenes forming a play with prologue and three acts (Return to Nature, Memory, Purification). Structures and statues through the garden form focal points to this libretto.\nWhen the park opened in September 1846, on the occasion of the VIII Congresso degli Scienziati Italiani, it quickly gained national fame. In 1928 its current owner, Matilde Gustinani, donated both park and botanical garden to Genoa for use as a public park. Through the remainder of the 20th century, the garden fell into some disrepair, and indeed was threatened in 1972 by construction of a nearby highway. Its restoration began in 1991, however, in honor of Columbus' discovery of America. As of 2006 about half of the park is open for visitors.\nIn 2017 the park was elected the most beautiful garden in Italy.The park contains two ponds, a dozen notable structures, various statues, and an extensive grotto. The grotto represents a Dantesque inferno, with walkways and subterranean lake through which the visitor may ascend to paradise. In former years, visitors could explore the grotto by boat. Structures include a Coffee House in the shape of triumphal arch, Rustic House, Madonna's Chapel, Mausoleum of the Captain, Temple of Diana, Flower House, Turkish Temple, Obelisk, and Chinese Pagoda.\nThe park also contains a number of plantings of botanical interest, including mature specimens of Araucaria bidwilli, Cedrus libani, Cinnamomum camphora, Jubaea chilensis, Notelaea excelsa, Firmiana simplex, Quercus suber, Podocarpus macrophillus, many exotic palms and a stand of some 160 Camellia japonica.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nVilla Gandolfi Pallavicini, Bologna\n\n\n== References ==\n\nVilla Pallavicini: Parco Romantico di Pegli, Genova Citt\u00e0 Inaspettata, Sagep Libri & Comunicazione Srl, Genoa, 2002.

          "This is a great experience and one not spoilt by the crowds of tourists at other places along the coast. It is easy to get to with the entrance close to Genova Pelgli station. The route through the garden takes you on a personal journey. There are many rare trees and interesting",

          "We decided to just pop inside on a Saturday morning, not expecting much as this church is quite plain from the outside. It's just amazing inside and quite breathtaking.",
          "Just popped in for a few minutes, since we were staying nearby. I am always amazed by the level of detail in the stone carvings and woodcarvings. There is a well known fresco that was not well known to us, and we didn't even see it, I confess. Definitely a nice church for the",
          "Unremarkable looking from the outside, but a true gem from the inside. One of the nicest churches I have ever seen. We've been lucky to see it before a wedding started.",
          "If you visit Genoa, you must take time to visit this unassuming church which is a little out of the main area. It has the most incredible ceilings and decoration I think I've ever seen - none of my many photos could do it justice!",
          "I was walking in the street and pass in front of this church and decided to enter to take a look and I'm really glad that I did it. Inside is very beautiful, especially the ceiling, so don't forget to take you camera.",
          "One of the nicest cathedrals i've visited. Relatively understated on the outside but the ceilings inside were absolutely beautiful. The art on the walls was great too. It was also very quiet and free to enter, definitely worth a visit.",
          "A beautiful Basilica with Roman style pillars in the front. It was very quiet on the inside with not many visitors so we could easily take our time and admire the wonderful surroundings. This was one of the three best churches we found in Genoa.",

          "This fascinating Basilica is very nondescript from the outside and can be easily missed. But if you take the time to look for it, and spend just a few minutes inside, you will be well rewarded. Yes, churches and basilica's seem to abound in Italy but this is a stunning place",

          "This baslica is on the Piazza delle Nunziata. It feels like a quiet retreat, an escape from the busy traffic outside. Too bad we were forced to donate before taking any pictures at all. The guardian of the house certainly was devoted to the place. We could take any postcard we",
          "This church or basillica is much smaller then the Cathedral of Genoa but also much nicer, it is Baroque but not high Baroque which is a bit over the top for me, The ceilings are as in so many churches completely covered with paintings, but you do not have to look up, the placed",

          "This church is stunning both inside and out and should not be missed. They say it is free entry, however if you'd like to take photos they ask for a 1eu donation, which is fair I guess as these buildings would not be cheap to maintain. You also need to pay another euro, if you",
          "A huge church with lots of gold baroque bling inside even thought the exterior is very plain. There are several side chapels with art work which is explained in a leaflet (available in several languages on sale for 1 euro). The church is very easy to visit as it lies in",
          "This is a breathtaking Baroque church dating back to the 1500's. The artwork inside is so extremely numerous that it's hard to see it all, indeed it's hard to grasp such 360 degrees of beauty. I recognized some of these works from art history text books back in college.",
          "While this large Church looks plain from outside,it appears to have been recently restored and the frescoes as well as the stone works inside are quite impressive. Light comes in from all sides and the interior is very pleasing",

          "As a person who has an interest in cathedrals and church buildings, I can categorically say that I have never been inside a church so beautiful, magnificent and spectacular. From the paintings on the walls to the marble columns and the exceptional ceiling covered in gold and",
          "One of the more spectacular churches I have seen in Italy. We almost wandered past the very plain column facade but glad we took the time. It is a very quiet church with few visitors. The ceiling is beautiful, completely covered in gold and frescoes. Even the marble columns are",
          "In a city of beautiful churches, this one took my breath away. Stunning gold gilded ceiling and red & white marble everywhere.",
          "This is a Church, not a Cathedral. Inside it feels like a place of worship, a very beautiful place of worship. It has vistors, but not too many, so you can sit and look, think, analyse, admire and just absorb the feeling of the place. I spent about 2 hours there and I doubt",
          "A simple outside facade didn't prepare us for the explosion of marble, gold and very good paintings. A nice experience but can be a bit overwhelming. Impressive cupola from within, worth seeing it in the full sunshine of a genovese summer's day",
          "I have visited Santissima Annunziata on several occasions, but Genova has no shortage of stunning churches to visit, making it difficult for the tourist to choose which ones to visit! My favorites are San Lorenzo, Chiesa del Gesu, San Siro, and the beautiful Romanesque Santa",
          "A stunning, stunning church. You could almost walk past it without even realising it's there as it is kind of shoe'd in amongst other large buildings on a traffic roundabout. As with most Italian places of worship, it is vast, spectacular, and you end up just gazing at the",

        "wiki": "The Cimitero monumentale di Staglieno is an extensive monumental cemetery located on a hillside in the district of Staglieno of Genoa, Italy, famous for its monumental sculpture. Covering an area of more than a square kilometre, it is one of the largest cemeteries in Europe.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe design of the cemetery of the City of Genoa dates back to Napoleon's Edict of Saint-Cloud from 1804, when he forbade burials in churches and towns.\nThe original project was approved in 1835 by the City's architect Carlo Barabino (1768\u20131835). However, he died the same year as a result of the cholera epidemic that struck the city and the project passed to his assistant and pupil Giovanni Battista Resasco (1798\u20131871).\nPart of the south-eastern hillside of Staglieno was acquired for the cemetery. The site of the Villa Vaccarezza was chosen as the most suitable, being both sparsely populated and close to the centre of the city. Work began in 1844 and it was opened on 2 January 1851. On that day there were four burials.\nOver time there were several extensions and the cemetery now includes sections for an English cemetery, a Protestant one and a Jewish one. \nAt the centre of the site is a tall statue of Faith, sculpted by Santo Varni. Facing the statue, up a grand staircase, is a domed Pantheon (a copy of the Pantheon in Rome) with a Doric portico flanked by two marble statues of the prophets Jeremiah and Job.\nAt the time Genoa was a major centre of learning within Italy and attracted reformists and an affluent bourgeoisie. Wishing to place long-lasting memorials to remember their work and moral accomplishments, they developed a tradition of funereal sculpture, particularly realistic works, to be placed with their tombs. \n\n\n== Memorials ==\nThe cemetery contains the graves of Oscar Wilde's wife Constance Lloyd, Ferruccio Parri, Fabrizio De Andr\u00e9, Nino Bixio, Michele Novaro, and Giuseppe Mazzini.\nSignificant sculptors with work here include Leonardo Bistolfi, Augusto Rivalta, Giulio Monteverde, Eugenio Baroni, Edoardo Alfieri and Vittorio Lavezzari.\nThe strong British influence in the city of Genoa in the late 19th century is reflected in the separate British Cemetery at Staglieno which contains the graves of British and Commonwealth servicemen from both the First and Second World Wars.  There are 230 from the First, (during which period there were 3 British military hospitals in the area) and 122 from the Second.  The latter, buried in a plot designed by architect Louis de Soissons, were mainly garrison burials or reburials concentrated from other cemeteries.\n\n\n== Cultural references ==\nMark Twain briefly praises the cemetery in his 1869 book Innocents Abroad, and Friedrich Nietzsche visited the cemetery frequently in the 1880s with his friend Paul Ree and had many long philosophical discussions as they strolled through the funereal colonnades.\nPhotographs of two tombs in the cemetery are featured on the covers of records by the English band Joy Division. The Appiani family tomb, sculpted by Demetrio Paernio circa 1910, was used on the cover of the album Closer. A grieving angel on the Ribaudo family tomb, sculpted by Onorato Toso also circa 1910, was used as an alternate cover for the 12\" version of the single Love Will Tear Us Apart. Both photographs were taken by Bernard Pierre Wolff in 1978.Staglieno was the subject of a 2003 book of photographs by Lee Friedlander. In that same year, a smaller selection of Friedlander's Staglieno photographs were published by the LeRoy Neiman Center for Print Studies, Columbia University, in a limited edition set of photogravures. The portfolio case of the project was bound in red coffin velvet to enhance the memorial effect of the project.According to The Making of On Her Majesty's Secret Service by Charles Helfenstein, the original opening for On Her Majesty's Secret Service in early scripts was supposed to have taken place at the Staglieno Cemetery. The plot involved Blofeld faking his own death and Bond visiting the Blofeld crypt at the Staglieno Cemetery to ensure he is dead.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCertosa di Bologna, the site of the city's monumental cemetery\nCimitero Monumentale di Milano\nMonteverde Angel \u2014 one of the most famous sculptures in the cemetery\nMonumental Cemetery of Bonaria in Sardinia\nUgo Foscolo\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Cimitero di Staglieno (Genoa) at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial website\nFlickr group of Staglieno Cemetery\nGuided visits 2016 at Staglieno\n\"Of Flesh and Stone\" images\nImages at stonecarver.com\nAmerican Friends of Italian Monumental Sculpture sponsors restoration at Staglieno\nSculptures of Vittorio Lavezzari in Staglieno Cemetery",

          "This cemetery was the highlight of my Genoa trip. Covering over 1sq kilometre this is one of the biggest cemeteries in all of Europe. What makes it so fascinating are the hundreds upon hundreds of unique statues. Yes there are a few angels and cupids but what makes it unique are",

          "This cemetery was my reason for visiting Genoa and it more than met expectations. Even if cemeteries aren\u2019t your thing, it is still worthwhile seeing this one. I am surprised there is any marble left in Italy\u2019s quarries, due to the amount in Staglieno. So many statues amassed",

          "Beautiful marble sculptures, thousands of tombs, breathtaking corridors and promenades. It's easy to reach from the downtown, busstop is in front of the entrance. I had only 2 hours for it, so I can visit only 10% of it. It's definitely a one-day programme.",
          "Family members had strongly urged us to visit this cemetery -- it was still so vivid in their minds after visiting 10 years ago. It is well worth the bus ride and a couple of hours to stroll through the enormous hallways lined with very tall tombs. It really is a very",
          "Because we only came here to visit the tomb of the late great Fabrizio de Andr\u00e9 we really only scratched the surface of this incredible place. Breathtaking sculpture at every turn. You would would need a day to take it all in. Wouldn't describe it as the highlight of Genoa by",
          "I can only compare it to the cemetery in Venice and I loved the statuary and grandeur of the place. I visited with 2 other adults and their young children. They hated it--thought it was creepy and not well maintained. Granted, it is not very stroller-friendly due to all of the",

        "wiki": "The Palazzo Spinola di Pellicceria, also known as Palazzo Francesco Grimaldi, is a palace located in piazza di Pellicceria in the historical center of Genoa, Northwestern Italy. The palace was one of the 163 Palazzi dei Rolli of Genoa, the selected private residences where the notable guests of the Republic of Genoa were hosted during State visits. On 13 luglio del 2006 it was added to the list of 42 palaces which now form the UNESCO World Heritage Site Genoa: Le Strade Nuove and the system of the Palazzi dei Rolli. It is currently owned by the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism and houses the National Gallery of Art in Palazzo Spinola (National Gallery of Palazzo Spinola).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe funds for the initial construction of this palace was present in the will of Francesco Grimaldi, made prior to 1593, when construction began upon medieval foundations at the site. The palace was included in the Rolli or list of aristocratic residences, that could be used by the government for hosting prominent visitors.\nAn etching of its fa\u00e7ade is included in Peter Paul Rubens's 1622 book I Palazzi di Genova, printed in Antwerp in 1622. The Grimaldi family commissioned the fresco decorations by Lorenzo De Ferrari and Lazzaro Tavarone. The ceiling frescoes by Tavarone depict: the Siege of Lisbon by Duke of Alba (first floor) and the Triumph of Ranieri Grimaldi in 1304 over the Flemish fleet at Zierikzee (second floor).The palace belonged to the House of Grimaldi until 1641-1650, when it was transferred to Ansaldo Pallavicini, a brother in law of Tommaso Grimaldi, in order to settle a debt. Ansaldo was responsible for closing the open loggia of the first floor. The palace eventually passed through marriage from the Pallavicini to the Doria family, when Anna Maria Pallavicino married to Gerolamo Doria. In the 18th century it again passed through marriage to become the property of the House of Spinola, when Maddalena Doria married to Niccol\u00f2 Spinola.  Maddalena directed the Rococo refurbishment in the mid-18th century, and engaged Lorenzo De Ferrari, Giovanni Battista Natali and Sebastiano Galeotti to paint the quadratura and decoration. She also commissioned the Gallery of Mirrors. Her grandson, Paolo Francesco Spinola, however was forced during the Napoleonic occupation to sell many works of art; his portrait (1794) by Angelica Kauffman is on display in the palace. By 1830 the palace was owned by the Tollot Family who would give it to Tito and Ferdinando Pignone in 1875.\nThe building has characteristics typical of late 16th-century Genoese palaces, having an entrance hall and an inner courtyard. The palace also had an extensive art collection, including paintings by Luca Cambiasi, Bernardo Castello and Bernardo Strozzi.The third floor of the palace was destroyed during bombing during World War II. In 1958, the marquis Paolo and Franco Spinola donated the building, complete with its furnishings, artworks, silverware, ceramics, etchings and books, to the Italian government. The damaged part was subsequently rebuilt, and it has housed the National Gallery of Palazzo Spinola since 1993.Among the works of art in the collection are:\n\nPraying Virgin by Joos van Cleve\nAllegory of the Peace and the War by Luca Giordano\nPortrait of a nun by Bernardo Strozzi\nEcce Homo by Antonello da Messina\nEquestrian portrait of Giovanni Carlo Doria by Rubens\nJustice statue by Giovanni Pisano\nPutti for Capella Grimaldi by Giambologna and Pietro Francavilla\n\n\n== See also ==\nGenoa: Le Strade Nuove and the system of the Palazzi dei Rolli\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGioconda Pomella (2007), Guida Completa ai Palazzi dei Rolli Genova, Genova, De Ferrari Editore(ISBN 9788871728155)\nMauro Quercioli (2008), I Palazzi dei Rolli di Genova, Roma, Libreria dello Stato (ISBN 9788824011433)\nFiorella Caraceni Poleggi (2001), Palazzi Antichi e Moderni di Genova raccolti e disegnati da Pietro Paolo Rubens (1652), Genova, Tormena Editore (ISBN 9788884801302)\nMario Lab\u00f2 (2003), I palazzi di Genova di P.P.

          "As a matter of fact, this Museum was originally a family Palace and you can still feel and visit the various environments, including the kitchen. The painting gallery is fantastic, but also the huge geographical maps on the walls and the collection of ceramics.",
          "This is not a guided visit, but you are accompanied. Original works of art, incredible Chinese porcelain, and they offer piano concertos in season. I was impressed by the art collection on the top floor, as well as the view from the rooftop terrace. I really enjoyed this",
          "This museum is smaller than some to the others, and we had a real problem trying to find this one. This museum is smaller than the others but do not miss it. You are escorted round but you have very good access to all the room and exhibits. Again this gives you real insight into",
          "We had difficulty finding this attraction from the direction we approached. When we finally found it we were greeted by a number of staff who informed us for security reasons we had to take a tour and told to come back later. On returning we purchased entrance tickets but there",
          "It's not everyday you get so close to a Van Dyk or Ruben. Though it takes some finding in the maze that is medieval Genoa it is worth the trouble. Be warned the people guarding the treasure are very weird. They are like undercover spies. You can only enter when it suits them and",
          "They let you enter the palazzo only once in an hour (9.30, 10.30 etc) Some of the rooms have been preserved as they were when the Spinola family was living in the palazzo. It will take you 45 to 60 minutes to walk through the palazzo.",
          "We enjoyed this gallery/museum overall, but I would recommend spending less time in the lower floors of the palazzo and miving pretty quickly to the upper floors that house the national gallery. The lower floors, which present authentic 18th century furnishings and decor, are so",
          "Difficult to find the entrance to this palace/museum but definitely worth seeking out. The art is displayed in a beautiful palace over several floors. There is a lovely little terrace at the top of a spiral staircase which gives great views over the city. There is a leaflet",
          "This gallery is cheap to visit and full of interesting pictures of the rich of Genoa as they were in the past. There are a lot of stairs to climb!",
          "A very interesting museum, but visits are only allowed on the half hour, so you will have to wait if you arrive in between. You are accompanied everywhere by security, who don't act as guides at all. It can be a bit off putting, but there is a lot to see in this former family",
          "Artwork and textiles in the rooms of this hidden palazzo. The teapot collection and other pottery were included in the attic",
          "As a gallery this cannot compete with the world's great galleries, so if you have visited London's National Gallery, National Portrait Galley or the Tate, not to mention the V&A, you will be disappointed with the pictures and other objects on display in the Galleria Nationale",
          "A very nice mansion decorated in the style of the period. Very ornate with beautiful frescos and furnishing of the period. Art work by Van Dyck, Van Cleve, Brueghel The younger and others. A very nice and relaxed visit. Yona S.",
          "Absolutely stunning! Definitely worth visiting even though it's not as easy to find as other palaces because it's not on Via Garibaldi but rather further in the Old Town. I would highly recommend spending time wondering around old narrow streets to get to this Palazzo as it's",
          "In a small city you can find a beautiful palace to visit. A lot much nicer than a lot I have been in many places: You can see the very old money of the Spinola and other important families in Italy. Very well kept.",
          "It is almost impossible to find this mini palace. A car does not fit on the surrounding streets so you have to walk. The neighborhood is scary and possibly unsafe. It was the first time in Europe we were afraid to walk. Once inside on a hot day we were given a tour by a very",
          "Because Genoa is the town with more that 100 palaces, it is necessary to select few of them. Spinola Palace is also a museum. I was nice but nothing special when you have seen others ten palaces. Good place for lovers of history",
          "The rooms are beautifulli painted and decorated. The most impressive is the mirror hall. The only entrance to the palace is by lift with the group. The groups are gathering every half hour.",
          "Excellent visit. Tours are set on the hour. Excellent guide provided background info on every room on each floor. Pointed out family history, key historical info, artists and influential art. Spoke English. Very knowledgeable and tied together works of art and history from other",
          "Lighting inside is not always the best but the Antonello da Messina piece by itself and some of the other pieces , and the ceilings are worth the visit . you do not get so much the feeling of an ancient palazzo, but some of the furniture is also quite remarkable",
          "One of Genoa's biggest families used to own this beautiful Palazzo and, it is worth a quick visit (4\u20ac/pax). There are a few Rubens paintings which are amazing and, if you are lucky enough, the expo featuring traditional Ligurian Jeans costumes will be open. It was the main",
          "Couldn't help thinking of my visit to this palazzo (nearly 2 years ago) this afternoon when I went to NY's Frick Collection for the last day of a Van Dyck show. Remembered the lovely Van Dycks and other Flemish paintings I had seen in Genoa and wished the Frick were as",
          "We visited this gallery as part of a multi-site Genoa tourist Museum ticket - but we are so glad we did we would recommend others to make this a priority visit as we almost missed it due to a tight schedule. This national gallery/museum is a fascinating collection of art, maps,",
          "We made a special point to visit the four museums all in one day but there were only three open. We did go back for the fourth one and glad we did. There is an amazing amount of visuals to take in. Between the furniture and clocks, paintings and sculptures and ceilings that are",
          "You can still view furniture and fixtures in this museum. Period furniture (1500-1600) is spread throughout in what were sitting rooms, bedrooms, dining rooms, kitchen, etc. You will also find works by Messina, Van Cleeve, Van Dyck, Rubens as well as other minor artists. Worth",
          "First let me say, that i enjoyed my visit to Palazzo Spinola. The strange thing is that they only allow people in at certain hours, and in groups, which are accompanied by an attendant. Now, this person is not a guide, but only someone who tells you which rooms you can go",
          "Most reviews you find here refer to the Museo di Palazzo Reale (Royal Palace) on Via Balbi. You can get a combination ticket together with the Galleria. Note that the Galleria Spinola has nothing to do with the Spianata de Castelletto, where you can enjoy Genua views after",
          "Here you can experience how the aristocracy lived and the artworks, cercamics and sculpture they bought to make their lives pleasant. You need a couple of hours or more to do it justice.",
          "Palazzo Spinola still retains the feeling of being a residence, with furniture arranged in all the rooms, and with even a large old-fashioned kitchen tucked away off the stairs. Apparently the family who gifted it as a museum wanted it to retain its residential nature. Of",
          "This is one of the many Genoa palaces that is now an art museum. This one contains much of its original furniture as well. There are some very famous works here, including Dutch masters. The first few floors are still the original palace. The top floor--which was the",
          "This palace is worth seeking out for many reasons. First, the lovely roof terrace which is quiet and sunny - so peaceful compared to the bustle of the streets below. Second, the fabulous paintings - not every one - but some stunning ones are set apart and are true masterpieces.",
          "Loved the old maps and seeing the Rubens in the final room. The view from the rooftop garden is very pretty",
          "Very in agreement with the previous reviewer AnnArbor. The EUR4 entrance fee is worthwhile as there are approximately 4 floors to see of various period antiques. The actual area of the museum is a little seedy even if it is only a 3 minute walk off via Garibaldi - EVERYONE",
          "Galleria Nazionale, Palazzo Spinola, The National Gallery or Palazzo Spinola National Gallery are all one in the same! It is a wonderful museum and former home of the Spinola family, so it contains some of the original furnishings and their extensive picture collection,"

        "wiki": "The Christopher Columbus House in Genoa is an 18th-century reconstruction of the house in which Christopher Columbus grew up.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe house is located outside Genoa's 14th-century walls. During the Renaissance, the area became subject to intense building, mainly consisting of public housing.\nColumbus was born in 1451, and historical documents indicated that Columbus lived here between approximately 1455 and 1470. At this time, the house had two or maybe three stories, with a shop on the ground floor, and the front door to the left of the shop.\nAccording to historian Marcello Staglieno, the original house was most likely destroyed in the French Bombardment of Genoa in 1684. It was rebuilt in the early 18th century on the basis of the original ruins. The rebuilt structure had a height of five stories. However, the upper stories were built by placing their beams on the neighboring buildings. When the neighboring buildings were demolished around 1900, as part of the construction of  Via XX Settembre, the upper stories of this building were removed, and it was reduced to its current height of two stories.\nCurrently the building operates as a museum, under the management of the \"Porta Soprana\" Genovese cultural association. Its central location and nearby parking make it a popular meeting place for the Genovese.",

        "wiki": "Santa Maria di Castello is a church and religious complex in Genoa, Italy. Administrated for a long time by the Dominicans, it is located in the Castello hill of the city, where in the Middle Ages a bishop's fortified castle existed. The church is flanked by the large Tower of the Embriaci.\nThe church, in Romanesque style, was erected before 900 AD. It houses many artworks commissioned by the main noble families of Genoa, by artists such as Francesco Maria Schiaffino, Lorenzo Fasolo, Alessandro Gherardini, Giuseppe Palmieri, Francesco Boccaccino, Pier Francesco Sacchi, Bernardo Castello, Aurelio Lomi and Tommaso Orsolino. Notable are the frescoes with Stories of David and the painted majolicas from the 16th century Genoese school.\nThe high altar is decorated by a marble group of the \"Assumption\" by Domenico Parodi (late 17th century), while the chapel to the left of the presbytery has a Santa Rosa da Lima by Domenico Piola and a marble cover by Taddeo Carlone. The fourth chapel in the left aisle has a Madonna del Rosario by the workshop of Anton Maria Maragliano, while the first chapel has a painting attributed to Giovanni Battista Paggi (early 17th century).\nThe baptistery has a polyptych from Lombard masters of the 15th century. The main portal is in Tuscan style (mid-15th century), and is surmounted by a Gothic lunette of the 14th century with a \"Crucifixion\".\nThe loggia facing the second cloister has frescoes of Saints, a Madonna and, on the first floor, an Annunciation by Giusto d'Alemagna (1451). In the upper floor has a statue of \"St. Catherina of Alexandria\" and a marble tabernacle attributed to Domenico Gagini (15th century).\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Italian)",

          "The Musei di Strada Nuova makes up three historical palaces along Via Garibaldi; Palazzo Rosso, Palazzo Bianco and Palazzo Tursi, which can be visited on a combined ticket. There is so much to see within these three museums, including plenty of artwork (my highlight being",

          "I was quite surprised by how interesting I found this museum. The art is interesting as is the palace and at the end, you get to go on to the roof and the view of Genoa is breath-taking. You buy the tickets from across the road in the shop and it is worth every penny. Allow a",
          "These are truly beautiful museums with lovely interiors and masses of incredible paintings - the height of which was for me the Paganini room with his Cannon violin. However, we were bemused to be told by staff to go in a certain direction - and we could not return to the rooms",
          "We visited four museums that are right by each other. Each museum has beautiful paintings along with many interesting things about each one.",
          "You haven't seen Genoa if you haven't visited at least one of the palazzi build from the profit made by investors in the early voyages of Christopher Colombus and his contemporries to South America. This is serious wealth, from paintings to the sheer exuberance of the buildings",
          "The three Palazzi museums, Rosso, Bianco and Tursi, make up Musei di Strada Nuova (the original name of Via Garibaldi). These museums are a top draw in Genoa/Genova but Palazzo Rosso was my favorite. Each one will take 30-60 minutes to tour depending on your interests.",
          "Ok this the grandest street you will ever walk down. It appears that the wealth from trade was spent on these splendid palaces. Such beauty. Such wealth probably a shame they didn't share a little.",
          "This street and these wonderful palaces are so beautifully preserved that you get the feeling of being transported back to the 16th century. Rich art works fill all the rooms and the size of the entrances and great halls is amazing. One room after another of beautiful",
          "These museums are in palaces built in the 16th and 17th centuries for Genoa's elite families. Rubens made an engraved series of them because he was so impressed. The ones that are open to the public contain great works of art.",
          "Visited the great 3 museums on the Strada Nuovo. Not so interested in the art works but the Hall of mirrors was wonderful and the ceiling paintings were still in fine condition. Take time to go up in the lift to the high point for the city view. We had the benefit of sound",
          "We went here on a rainy day to explore the historic buildings and art in the 3 palazzos. Some parts were closed due to the bad weather but overall it was a great experience. There is a lot to see, maybe even to much. The buildings itselfs are already worth visiting, great",
          "Went by myself, tickets are \u20ac9 for all three palaces, which I found reasonable. Some places were under construction when I went in July 2015 so I didn't get to see everything. There was still a lot of content so I'd recommend going.",
          "These museums are a nice way to spend a couple of hours (or more if you are that sort!) The Museo Bianca has great art. The Museo Tursi - well, we couldn't find much at all. But it is a wonderful building full of administrative offices, and poor signage!! The ticket was cheap,",
          "These three palazzi are simply gorgeous and a must see in Genoa. There are a lot of important painters and breathtaking masterpieces (such as the marvellous Canova's la Maddalena Penitente). However, I would suggest to visit them only to people who are interested and know",
          "The title says it all. These are amazing buildings with a great view over the city and fantastic furnishings and some terrific tromp l'oiel. The paintings are a lot of early Christian tales illustrated with white people in renaissance clothing.",
          "I was disappointed in these museums except for the excellent opportunity to ride to the roof for a panoramic view of the city and harbour of Genoa. The \"three\" museums are integrated, but you can opt out of various parts. We thought the paintings rather bland, mostly artists",
          "We paid 9e each for the visit to the three palazzos od Rosso, Bianco and Tursi. We are not greatly into paintings so the best parts were the period furniture on level 3 of Palazzo Rosso and the rooftop views of the city - take the lift on level 3 to level 9. We also were there",
          "Straddling three Palazzos,the visit of this Museum is akin to a treasure hunt. The best segments are in the Palazzo Bianco and the Palazzo Rosso . The latter also includes and incredible roof top view of the city literally not for vertigo inclined visitors. The Palazzo Tursi",
          "We took a walking tour of Genoa. Sundays at 10am there is an English tour! Meet at the ticketing office near the Aquarium. Do not wait at the \"I\" tourist information kiosk, we did, and almost missed the tour. $12 Euro. with it free entrance to the three Musei di Strada Nuova",
          "On the one rainy day of our stay, we went to Genoa to see some museums. We started at the Palazzo Rosso and ended up spending a couple of hours there. The art collection was huge and very beautiful. Even the ceilings had paintings (murals?) on them in many of the rooms. The",
          "The museums along Via Garibaldi are known collectively as the 'Musei di Strada Nuova' - the individual buildings are the Palazzo Bianco, Palazzo Rosso and Palazzo Tursi. You have to buy your entry ticket (valid for all three) from the bookshop between Bianco and Tursi before",
          "The art collection was interesting (but I must admit, not entirely captivating to a non-art-connoisseur), the interiors on the higher floors were fantastic, but the true highlight for me was the elevator to the rooftop, where you have an amazing 360degree view of the city.",
          "An eclectic art collection, beautifully restored rooms, and the wonderful view from the rooftop, makes this a must see! The highlight was when a guard opened a solid door and left us alone in a library where Paganini's violin and violin case was displayed. Guides direct you",
          "Not so rich as Pallazo Rosso or Pallazo Reale, but still a palace for you to visit. Don't miss this one either. Actually, if you visit Pallazo Rosso, they are connected and you go from one to the other. Beautiful too.",
          "A palace showing you how was the life in Genoa in the past. Many rooms and wonderful exhibits. Don't miss the upper terrace from where you can have a wonderful view of Genoa from the top.",
          "A single ticket will get you entrance to both the Palazzo Rosso and the Palazzo Bianco. Bianco's big attraction in the art collection. Frankly, I was disappointed because much of the collection is by artists of modest talents and the singe Caravaggio was on loan to another",
          "I think they promote it a lot with names like Rubens and they really have just a couple of Rubens. The art that the have is mostly from the 15th-16th century done by artists not known (students or studios) However, at the end of the day art is art and if you have time go and",
          "We visited Genoa on Aug 5th and were surprised by how empty the streets were as locals escaped the heat for holiday elsewhere. The Strada Nuovo museums were included in the price of this walking tour (which I highly recommend)",
          "Located on the Strada Nuova (Via Garibaldi), a UNESCO World Heritage Site and home to some magnificent Renaissance and Baroque palaces. Companion to the Palazzo Rosso across the street, this museum has a wonderful collection of 16th-18th European art including Lippi's St",
          "Nice museum on an extraordinary street, Strada Nuova, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Went up to the top floor where there is an apartment used by a former director of the museums. While there the guard motioned us to an elevator which went up to the roof. Once up there, we were",
          "It distresses me that the Galleria di Palazzo Blanco (Gallery of the White Palace) is rated so low on TA, as it\u2019s really one of the most important museums and finest palaces in the city with excellent art! See my extensive review below for the notable collection of art,",
          "Ask to be taken by elevator to the top floor, then climb the rickety metal stairs to the crow's nest and be rewarded with the best view of Genoa available!",
          "This is a must do in Genova. Top tip: buy your ticket from the book and gift shop opposite. Use the lift in the palace to get out onto the roof. You will need about 1.5 hours minimum to do the palace justice. The ground floor cafe is good.",
          "Given the rather ordinary unassuming streetscape for this palace, our expectations were really quite modest. What a delightful experience! The entry fee of \u20ac6 pp included two less impressive palaces, but this one blew us away. Interior was amazing mix of elegant rooms,",
          "Just a sort stroll from the Square of Ferrari (centre of town), down a narrow, cobbled street filled with quaint food shops, delis etc and you'll find Palazzo Rosso with wonderful art works from the Renaissance etc. Yes I know, I'm no artist but it's well worth a visit!",
          "Palazzo Bianco is one of the Palazzi dei Rolli along the Strada Nuova. It along with Palazzo Ross across the Strada. It is a very well laid out museum with a garden on the first floor. There is a lift but only from the first floor. It is well worth spending some time here.",
          "Galleria di Palazzo Rosso Via Garibaldi 18. This is one of three Palazzi on Via Garibaldi that have been extensively renovated and turned into museums. The one ticket covers all three -this one and - Palazzo Bianco (Via Garibaldi 11), Doria Tursi (Via Garibaldi 9). The",
          "Palazzo Tursi is the head office of the City Council for Genova and a favorite place for the Genovese to be married. It dates back to the 16th century, and belonged to the famous Doria family, and then it was bought by the Savoy until 1848 when it became the City Hall. There are",
          "Palazzo Bianco on Via Garibaldi has everything I enjoy when visiting a museum; a good collection of Genoese, Flemish and French paintings from the 12th-17th century, nicely presented, a manageable sized collection and an excellent audio guide. This is my 3rd visit after it's",
          "Palazzo Rosso is one of three Palaces converted to a museum on Via Garibaldi, the UNESCO World Heritage Street. The museum mixes paintings with sculpture, furniture and tapestry in some beautifully restored frescoed rooms. The museum is open Tues-Friday 9A-7P and Sat/Sun from"

          "Genoa has always been a sea based town, and this is evident as you walk through the port area. Thrre are still old but still working fishing boats and one can see how the city has evolved and developed around the port into the cobbled Old City and beyond. Best time to visit is",
          "Great place to arrive on the walk down from the city centre. Busy port with amazing super yachts to admire. Numerous places to sit and enjoy the sun watching all that\u2019s going on around. Singing,music etc. Lots of restaurants and bars for food and refreshments. We always",
          "A great place to sit or wander around at any time of day or in the evening. Lots of bars and restaurants offering a good selection of food. Access to the aquarium and the Galata Museo del Mare, as well as the NH collection Genova Marina hotel and the Neptune Galleon and il",

          "We stayed four nights in Genoa, and it seemed most nights we ended up down here. Large port boardwalk, very close to old historic centre of town, made for a nice stroll, gelato, or dinner. From the boardwalk, u can see the colorful homes rising up into the hillside. In evening,",
          "The first thing we did on arrival from the old town was to go to the Tourist Office which gave us good ideas and we realised how much there is to see and do: the aquarium, the old galeon, the lido, the lighthouse, lots of bars and restaurants. It really is a must.",
          "Lots of things to do here. The ship is fascinating to visit. You can visit the museums and the aquarium and cafes and restaurants.",
          "Beautiful port to walk, and play In the different games they have around for kids. Also there is a pool in the port.",
          "The port is nice but weather was not great humidity was very high, I enjoyed walking around, you can see the old ship, museums and the aquarium. you can also take a boat trip around the port. also a good selection of cafe's and restaurants. If you're in Genoa I think you should",

          "Sadly the place and the surrounding are swamped by unpleasant people harassing you - in same areas you feel unsafe as a single (female) traveler. Genova: clean up your act and areas and tourisme would truly boom",

          "Billed as an historic site, but it's been gentrified extensively and has little of interest unless you seek a Burger Kingdom. Genoa has so much more of interest a couple of streets inland.",
          "discreet food. many of the dishes are already prepared in advance but daily. the salads are fresh and plentiful. the staff very kind. if you went to visit the aquarium or the sea museum it's a good place to stop for lunch",
          "The Old Port is within the walking distance from anywhere in the city of Genoa. The buildings along the motor way on the other side of the port give visitors the picture of busy business activities in the past. At night time, the bars and restaurant have holiday atmosphere.",

          "Hello, This is a very nice port situated in Genova, with lots of attractions and things to see and visit. It has a lot of museums and promenade restaurants. The downside of it it\u2019s numerous beggars and africans wanting to sell you all kind of rubbish. They even get aggressive",
          "We were luck to have our flat located just next to the Old Port. It\u2019s a nice place to have a walk in the evening or have a drink in one of the nice bars. The beautiful Aquarium is also located just by the Old Port.",
          "This place is amazing, it has the boats, the breeze and the restaurants that can make an awesome day to hang out.",
          "the place is beautiful with many attractions,,,,however allas we felt unsafe as all this area is filled with illegal immigrants ( as we were told by the hotel) it is such a pity, as we wanted to go and walk around nightly, but we gave up,,,,,",

          "I spent only a little while in the Old Port area, but I thought that what I did see was interesting. The first time I laid eyes on the Mediterranean was here, so it\u2019s got sort of a sentimental significance for me personally. All that aside, there are lots of attractions (like",
          "The old port area was interesting to walk through. There is a mix of tourist attractions, bars and restaurants, pleasure craft and cruise ships, and the shipping port area. The waterfront was a bit dirty and smelly, which was disappointing. The old city gate was very impressive.",

          "No e place to walk around. Some modern part and some less. A piece of history. Take your hat in the day at summer time!",
          "Nice to spend some time, a nice short walk and variety of things to see. Tonight there were some sport games to watch live as well.",
          "I just can't say that there is much to recommend this area. There were modern touches and buildings surrounding the waterfront, some renovation. But it's stark overall, and there's not necessarily a lot of amenity, and there's definitely not a lot of shade. If there were a",

          "I went to this place for a walk around. Really nice harbour and biosphere. Great for taking pictures. The only thing is by the Pirate Ship some guys tried to sell some kind of little turtles in something of some sort. I had to do a swift exit as they were quite forceful. Apart",

          "There are some interesting places and ships to visit but right in the middle there is a sewer pouring out into the harbor with associated smell. Can\u2019t believe they allow this to happen and not clean their waste water. Kind of an insult to the environment and definitely not",
          "Our MSC cruise ship had a port here. We were able to walk around the harbor and visit several local shops. This was a busy little town and we did not have that much time to explore as we took an excursion Portofino. The limited time we had here was ok.",

          "We took the hop on hop off bus to the old wharf. What a hive of activity, and interesting place. We stayed all day so much to see and do and such a vibrant place. Lots of cafes and restaurants too. A must see and do place. Fabulous",

          "This is a carbon copy of modernised ports around the world. Harbouring restaurants& luxury yachts lined up. But it does have some charms, so definitely worth a look on a beautiful day. The aquarium building is amongst one of the attractions.",

          "This port is huge! There are restaurants pop-up shops on the weekends and a spectacular aquarium directly in the center which is a must do. They have a Ferris wheel and a type of cable car that takes you directly up so you can see panoramic views of Genoa and the port. Whether",
          "My husband is passionate by boats, so couldn't miss it. It is quite nice. You get to see history and modern boats alltogether. We stood by sunset and watched a huge cruise ship arriving and it was very relaxing. The new, modern, rich boats make you dream of the French Riviera.",

          "Thanks to Renzo Piano's update, the old port is now a bustle place and a must when in Genoa. Plenty of restaurants, cafes and seafront views. Great for a walk anytime of the day.",
          "The port is full of boats, and interesting things to look at. Everywhere there were points of interest - a historical building, a modern boat and an old relic. The marina was lovely, with lots of different cafes and bars to try, ice cream to taste and lots of things to look at",

          "This area has been upgraded it seems and there is quite a bit to occupy your time apart from generally wandering around. The big wheel and vertical panoramic lift affords good views.Various places to eat. Of course lots of luxurious yachts/boats to view. Maybe some of them even",
          "Our heritage walk through Genoa city culminated at the Porto Antico which is the old port area. With an hour to spend there is plenty we could do around this lively area of Genoa buzzing with life and activity. There is a lovely aquarium with a steep entrance fee which could",

          "We recommend to park your car at the Marina and combine a walk between the narrow streets of the \"Antico Porto\" and then strolling trough the newly restored docks. From there you will have a fantastic view of the city of Genova.",
          "I have visited the old harbour many times. It is always a nice walk between the renewed building (with some remnant of old harbour gigantic tools) and the many boats on the sea. It has memory and life (many people always around). You can go alone, with friends, with kids ad",

          "I love the port. It's my go to destination in the city. It's a beautiful place to take in sunshine. Many of the docks have quiet benches with views. There are all of the museums, the lift, the lantern, the boats, the ferry, Eataly, street hawkers and performers, many good places",
          "The Port has a very large commercial side - a ferry terminal - a cruise ship port for both visiting and Genoa based ships - a large marina an a tourist area with an Aquarium. Also a passenger ferry runs across the harbour a few times a day. It is run (I believe) by the same",
          "The old port is good for a stroll and stop for coffee or ice cream but very busy when cruise ships are in port.",
          "I did not find this area to be very attractive. You will find an aquarium and the attic ship. The bad thing about this area is it is heavily populated by immigrants (most likely Morocco, Africa and Arab countries). We did not feel safe at night there at all. Day time is ok",

          "Our first night in Genoa there was a Food Fair at the Old Port with lots of different restaurants participating. There were people from all over the world in Genoa. Not as much English was spoken here as in Rome, also not a lot of the menus had English on them so it was a little",

          "Given the historic importance role of Genova, I expected more, something close to Venice, for instance. Many of the old buildings aren't well preserved. Definetly there are better things to know in Italy.",
          "Genoa is not a 'citta museo' as Venice has become. The Porto Antico is a bustling, lively place enlivened still further by the recent additions of la Galata, l'Acquario and il Bigi",
          "Beautiful old port that's always busting with life. Early mornings you'll find pescatori and joggers and dog walkers Daytime and nighttime fill with tourists snd locals. The sunset id particularly beautiful",

          "Nice city to visit, if you go by car, watch out for motorbikes. They are a lot and drive like crazy. The old port area, the Aquarium and the Galata Maritime Museum are particularly interesting to visit.",
          "As ports go this is pretty extensive and is relatively picturesque, though there are much more impressive marinas elsewhere in Europe. It is rather marred by an overhead concrete highway nearby.",

          "Lovely place to stroll around during the day and evening. There are a few restaurants as you enter over the road from the town but there are more if you walk around to the other side which have outside eating. If you go at night you can watch the cruise ships leaving and the",

          "This area is pedestrianised and has lots of nice bars and restaurants to choose from. In the evenings there is live music and a nIce family safe atmosphere. It's very easy to walk into town and there are nice restaurants within 10 minutes. It's a nice place for a short city",
          "If you are visiting Genoa, eventually you will find yourself in Porto Antico, for us we were there often during our stay and we always found something new each time. From the different performers around the area to the variety of restaurants and gelaterias, to the amazing views,",

          "We visited Genoa by car. You can find easily parking and cheap. But bars and restaurants are pretty overpriced for what they offer. Also, there are a lot of black/African people who tries to approach you for money and they don't look friendly at all. Careful with what goods you",
          "This was once the original port of Genoa and till about 80 years ago was a working port. All the old buildings have either been cleared or modernised turning this are into the cities cultural, leasure and arts area! This is where it all happens day and night and it a very busy",
          "The old marina is part of the port area and is a large open area where young and old can enjoy an evening walk. There are street artists and generally lots going on. You can peruse the menus of the several restaurants and generally get in without booking. The yachts add an extra",
          "Came here each evening in Genova. The place is usually buzzing with locals; tourists; street artists and on one night some local dancing. Along the quays there is a varied range of restaurants, some of them quite good. You can also look at the multi million pound super yachts",
          "While in Genova, make sure that you visit the Porto Antico. This is only a name because the port has some modern buildings which make it seem new. It is a large area with museums and restaurants where you could spend a lot of time with activities for the whole family. It is also",
          "A great place to view Genoa's port and the boats, but also the city itself on the mountain. Great restaurants also in the old port. A must to have the feel of Genoa.",

          "The old port is a happening place. Lined up with restaurants all the way on land and ships of many sizes beyond land. This is where many people come to jog in the morning. The opposite side is the old part of the town with many vintage building. There are events that happen",
          "After a day in Milano we took the train to Genova because we love the water and nothing beats a city on the coast! We loved every bit of Genova and the food was amazing, everything from pasta to pizza to seafood, it's really a big different to eat at the locals places then at",
          "I loved wandering through the passageways around the Old Port which reminded me of North African Souks. You'll find Bars & Restaurants as well as exotic stores related to the Port! Last of all I absorbed the atmosphere of this Port with the nearby Home of the Global Celebrity -",
          "We stopped there to had lunch and visit the Aquarium. Easy to find parking, a lot of place where to eat or have a coffee. We want to come back to visit the Galata Museum",

          "Genoa was great for us on our first visit to Northern Italy. I had researched local legend, Renzo Piano, a great architect who designed the aquarium here and made plans to redesign the location of the airport and energize the old port. Sea and yachts and great blue sky makes",
          "It had the potential of becoming one of the best areas in town but sadly all bars and restaurant in it are all quite bad regarding their offers and also very expensive. It should be full of crowded nice bars, rastaurants, clubs and instead there are none. Absolutely awful all",

          "Port Antico is a hub for Genoa, at the time of our visit it was home to a seafood festival. Really nice place to sit, watch the boats of all sizes including super yachts and cruise ships and eat at various restaurants. The aquarium is also located in this area although we",
          "Most of the visitors are getting to Genova Aquarium - so the square at the entrance always messy and crowdy. There are couple of retaurants aside. I expected more - better order and more nice places to have a glass of italian wine watching the harbour. You can have a walk to the",

          "We arrived in Genoa on a Sunday afternoon and headed straight to the old port which was buzzing! Street musicians and Italian families out for the afternoon. As keen photographers this was a great place and we went back each evening during our stay.Much quieter in the daytime",
          "I read a lot on the internet about safety before i come to Genoa. Seems 50% of people think it's dodgy and the other 50% think it's rosey. I don't think it's particularly rosey. Theres groups of Africans loitering about everywhere and being suss others are trying to sell you",

          "The port is worth seeing. It is not as charming or as quaint as many others but it is worth seeing. Check out maritime museum. Eat at Eataly and admire port authority building next door!",
          "The port is just beautiful. We had a great time picking out cruise ships further out and looking over sailboats and fishing boats. Take a stroll and get an ice cream, or stop at one of the many restaurants which have outdoor tables and have a drink while you take in the view",

          "The Old Port is a central point as from there you can get to all the acquarium stuff, citt\u00e0 dei bambini, Eataly, Galeone and so on and so forth. Also a nice place to have kids spend some energy, as you will find parks with swings and other games for kids, but also as I was there",
          "This is a good place to walk around and to perhaps get a ferry or visit the aquarium or the pirate ship, good eateries or somewhere to sit with a glass of prosecco and watch the world go by. For walking, running or sitting, plenty to see and do.",
          "The Old port of Genoa is an area being redeveloped. There are a number of newly updated restaurants and a few ready for updating. Visit the Aquarium if you have children and perhaps the pirate ship also",

          "I am not into sailing but just walking around and looking at the boats and wondering who they belong to makes for a fun time. It's also a nice walk away from the hustle and tourists. Really worth a little detour.",

          "The old port is a really nice and pleasant one. You'll be hable to walk by it for a long distance and there are things to do along. Mostly if you're a photographer you'll find many spots and angles that worth the shot. So, have fun.",
          "It is a fun place to explore during the day. I would not explore this area as a lone female in the evening. You can purchase a ticket for a boat ride, visit the aquarium, do some shopping or just walk around the area. There are street vendors so they will try to sell you their",

          "The old port is a mostly pleasant rambling place only marred by a superhighway that some brainiac decided to place in such a way as to ruin the quiet of this charming place.",
          "Nothing especial comparing to other ports present in the country but it has few museums that makes the walk worthy. And if you are fund of being next to see by sunrise (or sunset) then the port is satisfactory.",
          "I took a mid-morning walk along the walkway around the old port. There are few remnants on the water side that make you think of Genoa's origins. But some of the older buildings facing the water remind you that this port was active centuries ago. There is a replica ship",
          "Good for a walk around the old port, punctuated by a seat in the sun to observe all sorts of incidents. Relax into the ambience of the place . Entertainment that costs nothing at all.We enjoyed just taking our time to enjoy the blue sky, with sun dazzling on the water.There are",
          "The beginning of Genoa was the sea and the men who went down to ply it. Goods coming and going through this natural port under visionaries not the least of whom was Columbus. The port has been economically redeveloped and it is a pleasant if somewhat perfect place to visit.",
          "If u want to see some nice hatch tho is the place to be. just be careful about stealer and strange people that talk u around",

          "It's a pity that the port area has been allowed to get run down in places. There are some nice parts, but there was a lot of rubbish about and also a lot of unlicensed (I assume) trinket sellers. There are some nice enough places to eat. It's a pity about the road which is a",
          "The massive project by Renzo Piano had some problem, during executions, but since ended it give back to Genova its Porto Antico. Definitly worthy a visit to enjoy multiple attractions, or just chill out in the cafes Hope the Centro Storico should follow the same...may be next",
          "Nice place nice to walk along with good restaurants and coffee shops on the side. The aquarium is a bit rubbish not much to see that's special. BEWARE there are lots of conn men outside that area forcing their stuff on you and trying to rip you off. The port is more industrial",
          "Probably it is the place which not to be missed if you in Genoa. Originally it was just a ordinary old port with a lot of ships and boats around. But twenty years ago it was renovated and expanded so now you can find there oceanarium, small botanical garden in the glass sphere,",
          "It would be better if the overhead road did not cut through it as it takes away from the view. Busy and interesting and if you have plenty of money , there are some nice things to see and visit.. The port leads on to many interesting streets and there are planty of eating",
          "Redesigned area around the Old Port deserves a visit. Kids are free to play on several playgrounds or visit an exhibition or have some ice cream.. while adults can enjoy a walk around the port and get familiar with old docking equipment)",

          "We are so glad we fond this area. It has been well developed but not in a too commercialised way. Plenty of pedestrianised areas and a splattering of bars and cafes plus the excellent EatItaly mini supermarket.",
          "This area is very well done considering the great flyover nearby which seemed fairly quiet. There's plenty of eating places around all at reasonable prices, and has a really nice feel to it. It's very clean and you see see cleaners around all the time. There are seating",
          "But there is noting speciall to see there and to enjoy the day there unless you have your own boat there and you will be going out to the sea. Well the place is couded of people but I had an feeling that they are all looking for something to see and enjoy. Were they sucessful",
          "Old port is quite a good place to see. There is even an open swimming pool which we did not enter as we were planing to go to a beach but it looked like good option for next time. There are also several cafes and restaurants around the harbour. One good part for us was also",
          "Lots going on and some beautiful ships and yachts to view. Children play area is extensive and well used by many. There were street performers and restaurants to visit with views of the harbor. Many restaurants have a 30Euro limit for credit cards so make sure to have cash",
          "Genoa, including it's Old Port, is less about being an amazing visual experience and more about reflecting the City's past position as one of Europe's most important trading posts. Yes, there are attractions including a old galleon and a vast aquarium centre, plus some",
          "Food is ok but nothing special. Location is better than the rest of the old town which is quite dark and dirty.",
          "The place is really lively and have activity till the late-hours. We have found out that there are many street-artists at the evening, and you have a good oversight on the bay of Genua including the houses build on it. At the harbour there is a refurbished part concisting of",

          "The city has invested a lot of money in this port. A beautiful boardwalk that stretches by the water where you see people selling souvenirs, restaurants, a little train that moves people around, aquarium, marina, you see lots. It is beautiful, specially if it is a sunny day. Try",
          "In the evening the area of the Old Port looks enchanting. The most impressive is a huge ancien ship, a replica of a 17th-century Spanish galleon. The famous Aquarium of Genoa is also located here. There are a lot of bars and restaurants, however rather touristy ones. More tight",

          "This port has a great view, thus left us with a great experience. It can be visited either for a nice walk around the area, to either look at the boats or at night to enjoy the lights. The tourist office is on the port which is where the segways can also be rented. It can also",
          "I remember quite well this port because they had a Pirates Boat accessible to children with affordable fees to be paid. They took a lot of amazing pictures and enjoyed their time.",
          "I enjoyed all the boats. It is also right by the aquarium and by the tourist office. It is where the walking tour begins.",
          "Refurbished old port which hosts some mighty impressive yachts! The restaurants in the area are mostly chain restaurants and not somewhere I would eat buy nice to sit and have a drink near the water",

          "This was a lovely part of Genoa. We enjoyed wandering around here. There are quite a few restaurants to choose from and really nice gelati on t opposite side of t building where t big super yachts tie up. Gelati was well priced. These are also worth a look at! It seemed like a",

          "I found this place to be a nice spot to eat and drink in the early evening. I've been here for two weeks so far (alone) and have never felt intimidated or unsafe, however I have also never stayed down here after dark. Definitely worth a visit and a walk around as there's always",
          "Beautiful place to visit. Be careful about people coming up and talking to you. People will try to sell you things, just ignore and keep moving. Nice place to visit and a lot of things nearby.",

          "Romantic and clean. Nice restaurants and it's a pleasure to visit by day or night. Stay away from the \"pirate ship\"! It looks nice from outside, but inside it's a catastrophe! Everything is crumbled, it is far from any safety place for kids.",
          "Everyone ends up here sooner or later, maybe to do a ferry ride up the coast or take in some of the atmosphere of older waterfront Genoa and it's past decadence. The Pirate Galleon is really an incredible thing to look at and is a photographers dream.",

          "We arrived at the waterfront car park late afternoon and immediately felt intimidated by the undesirables who were clearly sizing us up. We 3 are very well travelled and confident 40-year-olds but all were uneasy and felt anxious. When we walked to our hotel which was only 5",

          "didnt like this area at all, lots of people loitering around looking shifty I think the area needs regenerating",
          "Sorry but it just didn\u2019t do it for us! It\u2019s full of fake stuff, rubbishy souvenirs, pushy vendors, litter and general tourist tat. There are a lot of grungy touristic restaurants too. Also a major elevated roadway cuts right across the port \u2013 spoiling the view back to the old",
          "Not attractive, not much to see. Genova is a commercial port, its people are really fantastic, but it is not a recreative tourist destination.",

          "The natural port and surrounding hills offer a hint to why this old pet exists. Modern touches are a good start but it still feels just a touch dodgy with some incomplete projects and people aggressively hawking cheap wares. Highlights: the views, people watching, Eataly food",
          "What happens with these projects is that the city loses its own character, we have seen too many like that. Perhaps because it was the beginning of August and it was too hot, but I missed some nice terraces to cool down in the area. Probably it's better at night.",
          "This is a great area for a walk along the water, there is so much to see! However when we went on a Sunday, there was a lot of activities going on so tons of people and vendors! Beautiful views and there's even a pirate ship!",
          "Had a great time walking along the harbor. There are a large amount of shops around this area along with \"shady\" vendors. Bought my wife a purse around here, wanted 45 Euro and paid 20. So what if it's fake, the wife is happy!",

          "Not impressed. The main reason is the luck of security. There are huge amount of some kind of vendors who behave themselves very aggressive even at the day light. While waiting to buy tickets to the Oceanarium at about 10 AM I even saw some of the vendors really pushing an",

          "Genoa in itself is a nice city but the port is what makes it special. There are boats of every shape and size from fishing boats to 4 story yachts. There are a few cute restaurants along the pier, but beware if you take a bench to relax on or grab a bite to eat, there are lots",
          "definitely nice walkway, through the port and different docks. Too busy with locals and tourists walking around till late at night",

          "Should take a stroll on the boardwalk full of palm trees around Porto Antico. There is a very old galley worth seeing. There are restaurants for food, coffee etc. There is also the Genoa Aquarium.",
          "I was hoping the metro would take me to a nice port area with boats, views, attractions etc. Instead I came out of the metro to an area dominated by a huge elevated road, which traffic thundering above your head. There is even a \"tourist information board\" singing the praises of",
          "Well worth a visit and especially the Panorama lift that rises 60m and turns giving you a wonderful panoramic view of the city and port. There is much to see walking around the port but unfortunately we did not allow enough time to visit the Aquarium which looks massive. Our",
          "There's quite much to do. Therefore, a visit to Porto antico can become quickly expensive if you are to visit some of the attractions located there (ticket for Aquarium 19E, 14 for Sea Museum and Submarine, 4 for panoramic lift Bigo, 5 or 6 for Neptune ship model (a replica used",
          "dont miss a visit to the old port if in genoa there is so much to see. The peddlers can be a little annoying but usually leave you alone if you ignore them, There are small cafes bars restaurants shops as well as all the trips out by boat sightseeing or visiting other locations",
          "The old port in Genoa has a storied history that is poorly met today by the clash of slightly crumbling old world architecture and the overlay of modern (albeit incomplete) infrastructure and tourist attractions. Frankly, I think the city of Genoa will be better off by treating",
          "Beautifully restored harbor buildings. The atmosphere is great on a sunny holiday. Full of kids as well as old people sitting on the benches and enjoying a chat with their friends",
          "A bit touristy... Could really do without the hustlers trying to sell me junk... The market is worth a quick stroll through. Go somewhere else to et though.... Restaurants crowded and loud!",
          "Renovated to a very high standard this area of Genoa is one of its main focal points. Plenty of street entertainment, wonderful selection of eating places and you can buy the best Focaccia bread in Italy. Not surprising as I believe Genoa is the city where the bread was first",
          "Beautiful sunset view with all the luxury boats near the Port. Many bars & cafes. Eataly - the food market chain is also located here. You can grab some foccacia bread, pesto sauce, cheese to eat and sit at the port area, just enjoy the view & watch people! :)",
          "Fairly standard old port, with some interesting twists (a pirate ship built for a movie is there on the waterfront). The waterfront is an eclectic mix of new and old. It's worth 30 mins and very close to the city center.",
          "Discover just how important a global maritime power Genoa is and was. The old passenger customs hall is a real reminder of when ocean transport ruled the world.",
          "I was quite dissapointed with Genoa's port. It is a mix between mass tourism and heavy industry. Which from a distance is very intriguing but up close is underwhelming. I loved Genoa but this was my least favourite part. I suggest taking a quick walk through but that is all you",
          "use undercover cops and security and hassle the shady characters that creep this place out. I don't get freaked much but too many uniformed cars and security to make me feel safe.",
          "Porto Antico is a big area perfectly renovated several years ago, directly in front of see, close to the centre of the city. You can find there: a nice walk close to the see, a swimming pool (only in summer), several good restaurants, pubs, shops and the Space Cinema where you",
          "The old port area is much like many such places in Europe, but the maratime Museum is a MUST I also like the replica pirate ship (albeit getting a bit bedraggled) from the Roman Polanski film \"Pirates\" which is tied up at the pier and can be clamboured over for a small fee",
          "With palm trees all over, you can feel the tropical atmosphere of Europe in Summer. Its a good spot to walk around wandering under the sun and do a photograph. There is a super huge cool boat. According to the local people, the boat was used once for filming a movie. Beautiful",
          "This entertainment complex is made for late evening summer strolls. It is a bit depressive in Winter.",
          "I attended Genoa Charter Show so the port was filled with many beautiful yachts. The views that the port offers are incomparable: hills are everywhere around you and you city the beauty of the area",
          "Waterfront and lanes behind are well worth a few hours of walking; it's not all 'tourist shopping' when off the main track.",
          "If you come to Genova you must stay in this area :) nice restaurants and a lot of things to do. Acquario and Museums",
          "This area used to be the old port of Genoa hence the name Porto Antico. It was renovated by the architect Renzo Piano for public use. Many things to do in the area best of all the Aquarium which is beautifully laid out particularly the jelly fish tank. The Bigo is an elevator",
          "Still a working port, considering this is the place where Columbus came from. A mall lots of restaurant and different kinds of boats and ships to look at with a real old galleon on display. Also nice place to have a picnic or/and people watch.",
          "Nice for a walk at the end of the day, of to stop by for a lunch and a gelato. The guys trying to sell fake merchandising are a bit too much for my taste",
          "Eventhough it is not the cleanest it is very different to what I have seen in the past. It is definitely one of the largest attractions as it has a lot to offer from lots of restaurants to museums, local markets on the weekends and some shops.",
          "Great port with a lot of interest - boats and workings. Lots of nice seats to sit and enjoy the outlook of the working port with the great backdrop of the city itself.",
          "the pirate ship is so fab we took lots of photos ,unfortunately the bigo was closed for maintenance!but we did go into the sphera very interesting fantasic birds",
          "If you're interested in Chris Columbus' hangouts, you come to Genova. Nearly every corner of the city has some story from the great explorer's past from childhood to adulthood. The old port has been left practically unchanged and most of the people who hang around there either",
          "We walked right down the front of Genoa and it is fascinating - the Museum of the sea (not the Acquarium) is a five star location for everyone to visit.",
          "Lovely place to stroll around boat and people-watching. Some really nice pubs and restaurants are springing up as a result of the refurbishment and it's just quite a nice place to hang out.",
          "Wonderful experience, the old galeon is beautiful and rows of other boats, yachts, ships and cruisers never end. Walk around the whole port, not only the old part, it's much quieter and the hill the city is situated on looks amazing from there. There are plenty of restaurants,",
          "Loved the atmosphere and was surprised at its beauty. In my opinion one of the most attractive ports in Italy. Fabulous views of the overhead skyline can been seen from this point, which I feel can compete with many of the worlds more comercialised ports. I loved it all!!",
          "This port was buzzling with activities as our visit conicide with the festa demorcartica genova.There are lots of restaurants and bar along the port to lunch or dine.Nearby attration will be the acquarium.It is a nearby walk from all the palaces in the city centre.",
          "The old port is the turistic place in Genova, here you can found a restaurants and bars and all you need for your vacationa in Genova. Stay there and in the old city",
          "Can easily get lost... some nice shops ... but was ruined when you are walking thru the old port with your kids and then we seem to be on the main area when all of a sudden you see -sex workers working the street and men trolling the area.",
          "Here you can find a lot of the main attraction points of Genova: the aquarium,the marine museum(Galata Museo del Mare),Biosfera,Bigo,Neptune galleon,La Citta dei Bambini(Children's city),Luzzati museum.From here you can take a \"boatbus\" to Pegli,a residential neighborhood. A",
          "We saw this area a few years ago and was looking forward to the authentic little shops which are great. Unfortunatelly they close for the August Italian holiday. Some are stillopen but perhapsoly in the ,orning. Stil, worth a wonder through the little medieval streets",
          "You can visit this but it is not a ''must''. I have a feeling that this mix between old and new facilities doesn't work so well. There are some restaurants but overpriced and it is not worth to sit there for lunch. I didn't feel well over there. I visited many places in Italy",
          "This place was a huge dissapointment, run down, dirty, smelling of urine and fesces. Best avoided.",
          "You realise the old history.Crucaders left from here and with their money they build a part of the city.",
          "Extremely interesting to walk around but wouldn't like to go there at night! Some very good cafes & restaurants but I would suggest going for lunch.",
          "The old port is worth a walk through after your visit to Old Town to see the cathedral and other sites in that area. The port area itself has many souvenir-type shops along the front that are not too appealing. There are a number of food stalls that for the most part we didn't",
          "Restaurants, marina, nightclubs, skateboarders...a place not only for tourists but many locals frequent the area as well. Enjoyable evening.",
          "there are several interesting things to see at the port",
          "The place has nothing interesting from a tourist's point of view. But it is a fact that it is the only place left on the city coast that is open to public access. Well, with 3 levels of lanes throughout the coast, and a harbour full of ships, one should not expect more. Just be",
          "..but beware of some overpriced tourist attractions too. great to wander round, and slurp and ice-cream whilst you watch the boats bobbing about",
          "We had a fun afternoon at Porto Antico, which has been developed into a lively city venue very similar to Baltimore's Inner Harbor to be enjoyed by local people, not just tourists. Besides the Aquarium, there are lots of restaurants, a historic galleon, and nearby historic",
          "Definitely, a landmark to visit. A good place to take pictures. If you pass by, make sure you visit the Aquarium and buy a pesto genovese sauce at Eataly!",
          "I think the place is nice, clean and not difficul to be found. But in a so large space, I would have expected more initiatives for visitors and citizens also arranged by municipaklity. I have never met lot of people (even in summer period)",
          "Very nice lace to spend an afternoon in Genoa, we didn't have much time so we just strolled through but the atmosphere of the port was very nice.",
          "We expected a seedy old port and instead found a lovely place to viist. We spent hours at the maritime museum.",
          "Lively waterfront area with great port views. I would advise checking out this area during the daylight hours and being careful to safeguard one's camera, wallet, etc.",
          "The scenery is beautiful. It's cool to spend your afternoon here with a sunbathing and a gelato :-)",

          "Porto Antico - the old port of Genova has had many a facelift but there is still enough of the old history to keep you occupied for a while. Genova was known for its maritime fleets and was a haven for traders. The port was much closer to the buildings than it is now, the land",
          "Arriving in Genoa late, this was the first port of call for food without jumping straight into the old town. On the whole it was fine but not at all representative of Genoa itself. The highpoint of the Old port was Eataly. Having experienced it in Lingotto, Turin, I was very",
          "The area is just ok with a lot of street venders. The town is not difficult if you have a decent map. Get one from the tourist authority."

It lies at the eastern side of the Corso Italia stroll, the main sea front stroll of the city of Genoa, at the feet of Via Aurora, a typical Ligurian narrow street (\"cr\u00eauza\").\nThe origin of the name is uncertain, one of the more reliable hypothesis is that the name comes from the form of the bay on which Boccadasse lies, thus the name should be the shortening of the Genoese for donkey's mouth b\u00f3cca d'\u00e2ze. Another theory is that the name derives from the torrent that used to flow through the village, the Asse, therefore the name should mean outlet of the Asse. \nThe village of Boccadasse attracts tourists. It is enclosed in a narrow bay, at the eastern side the cape of Santa Chiara with a castle (a new building in the style of a medieval castle), on the western side the rocks, and in the middle the tiny cobblestones beach where the seamen's small boats rest.",

Having walked for more than an hour to get there, my friend and I were completely underwhelmed by what we saw. And when exactly were all the photos promoting it taken? 20 years",
          "Must see place in Genova. Best to be there in the morning to see how \u201creal life\u201d looks there. Very good 100 years old ice creams.",
          "It's a short busride from downtown Genua to Boccadesse and it worth it! Amazing view of this pitoresque fishing village!",
          "You can get Boccadasse if you are in Genoa, simply taking bus n.42. It seems an old village, there are the old houses, a little beach where you can take a bath, or in winter time sunbath.Around you can find restaurant or better a bar to take a snack. Better to have a good",
          "Boccadasse is a great place to visit if you like the look of the coastal villages of Cinque Terre, but just don't have the time to visit them from Genoa. We visited in January, so it was nice and quiet, just a few people in the restaurants and on the beach, watching the sunset.",
          "Close to Genoa and easy to get to by bus (#42). Lovely views from the cliffs. Some of the restaurants had great views of the sea.",
          "A beautiful spot along the sea. When I was visiting, the seas were rough and the weather stormy. It added to the beauty of the coastline and the old city, imagining a time over 500 years ago and looking off into the distance envisoning the three ships: Nina, Pinta and Santa",
          "Very similar to the pictures you get in Cinque Terre, but in the middle of Genoa. When we arrived there was a group singing some traditional Ligurian song.",
          "I walked here from the Piazza in the centre of town (1 hour brisk walk) along the Corsa Italia and coast road. There are some spectacular coastal scenes along the way that made heading for Boccadasse worthwhile, but apart from a few quaint buildings on the seafront - I honestly",
          "Good alternative if you don\u2019t have time to visit Cinque Terre, since Boccadasse is just south of downtown Genoa. Beautiful colors especially at sunset. Tips: - make sure to taste a local Gelato - visit sure before sunset - if you don\u2019t have a car, take bus 15 or 31",
          "This is very pretty, small seaside village where their are restaurants with great views of the sea and people having fun soaking in the sun on their small beach. If you're in the area, it's a great place to have a nice lunch with a view. It can be a bit tricky finding it. You",
          "Boccadasse is a pleasant place to spend an evening there, walking in the seaside. I had the fortune to visit it with a brazilian couple who lives there. I went to pleasant restaurant nearby, but i do not remember the name, but there are several good restaurants there. If you are",
          "We spent our last few hours in Genoa here. The sun came out and the place was incredible. Wasn't too busy and was a perfect way to spend a few hours sat on the pebbles, enjoying the atmosphere and going for a paddle. Bellissimo!!!",
          "Highly recommended to visit. From our hotel we took bus no 15 and then walked left on small streets for about 10\". The sea was clean and you could climb on rocks to take photos. Be careful of strong waves though. We had a walk in the nearby streets, took photos and ate fried",
          "My girlfriend and I spent the day at the village. The sea was lovely. There are plenty of places to eat. We had the speciality fried fish that we enjoyed.",
          "We took a taxi from Genoa to Boccadasse - it was 10 Euros and worth not walking in the heat of the day. The driver dropped us right at the top of the stairs. Although a lot smaller than we were expecting, we were delighted by the colours of the houses, and a beautiful swim in",
          "A nice place for an ice cream in front of the sea ..... good for family and romantic couple. Lot of small boats on the beach .....",
          "There were a lot of people sitting around at restaurants or eating gelato. There's a church if you go up the stairs and the view is nice. Everything is lovely if you like sight seeing, relaxing by the ocean and eating gelato. There's only one gelato store along the beach and it",
          "We walked along the promenade almost to Genoa itself, admiring many beautiful buildings on one side and the sea,beaches,.pools etc on the other, then back to the tiny port. Gets busy here, as there is a very small beach, but worth a walk around the village and up into the hills",
          "Boccadasse is an hour's walk along the coastal path Corso Italia from Genoa; a path lined with cafes and beach bars. It's a bit of a trek but worth the walk. The village is every bit as stunning in person as the photographs suggest. Attractive coloured houses, great cafe /",
          "Lovely little harbour which has all the charm of the prettier Cinque Terre towns but is just a short bus ride from the centre of Genoa - much less crowded than the likes of Vernazza, We hopped off the bus, sat for a while in the harbour area, had a stroll around the nearby",
          "Very small beach in this lovely little seaside village, a truly wonderful, unspoilt place to be for those who love the real Italy",
          "Not a place to stay for days, but very much worth staying a couple of hours and really inhale the beautiful combination of sea, colorful houses and a typical Italian atmoshere. In the hot summer a great place to escape the heat.",
          "There is not much to do in Boccadasse but it doesnt matter! The charming view you will get is so worth going! I could sit there and admire the view for hours... It is really beautiful. - It is easy to get there from the center of Genua. - If you're hungry there are few",
          "We visited Boccadasse while we were staying in Genoa, It\u2019s only a short distance and easily accessible by bus and is definitely worth a visit for a day out of the city. A beautifully quaint little village where you can share the beach with locals and swim in the crystal clear",
          "Nice, local, small, traditional - and too much gelaterias. Not expected such place close to the tourist area",
          "This beautiful tiny beach and little walkways a well worth a look, not exactly buggy friendly, but don't miss seeing it.",
          "Beautiful bay, relaxed chill atmosphere. Stylish and sophisticated enclave of Genoa. a must see to escape the hustle and bustle of Genoa",
          "Very nice fishing village. Everyone is out eating cones of fried fish, sitting on the rocks watching the sunset and ending with an ice cream. Lovely holiday feel and nice to escape the hustle and bustle of Genoa. Definite highlight of the holiday. Added bonus is easy parking.",
          "It\u2019s beautiful to see and walking around there is very nice. Good restaurants around that area highly recommend visiting while in Genoa.",
          "The way to go there is \u00e0 nice promenade along the sea, arriving there it is \u00e0 pretty place to have a photo. If you have chance to get a sit in the cafe front of this cute creek, don\u2019t h\u00e9sitate. Child can go in the sea, note that there is \u00e0 lot of private beaches before arriving",
          "Quaint fishing town where you can swim in its calm bay, watch the sunset from the beach or join the locals for a drink in the evening. Lovely restaurant up a cobbled street that offers fresh fish.",
          "Guidebooks suggest this is easy to get to, which in some ways is true, but getting a ticket for the bus back can be tricky, especially on a Sunday. Ticket machines would help. The \"village\" itself is an inlet and a tiny public shingle beach, with a few expensive places to eat",
          "Not the best of the bays we visited.Go further down the coast towards Portofino Not a very nice beach,with a very grumpy woman running the the cafe on the front.Will not revisit !",
          "Super small and rocky beach. A few restaurants and generally just ok. If in Genoa there are other, better excursions. We found ourselves at a different and actually better beach a cove away.",
          "Bit of a disappointment if I\u2019m honest. The pictures on the web show a lovely picturesque city with beautifully coloured buildings around a port. For us that was the only corner of the place worth seeing. It only takes a few minutes to see, then there\u2019s nothing else.",
          "A small beautifull picturesque village close to genoa,,,recomend to visit the promenade on the seaside ( corso italia) along the beach till bocadasse.. Though it is a very small village with a very small beach, the place is beautifull and not to be missed,,,",
          "A very beautiful spot, busy with italians eating dinner, having drinks and eating gelato in the moonlit cobble stone paved piazza in a small bay.",
          "Take the no. 42 bus from outside Christoper Columbus's house. Or the 31 from Brignole railway station. Takes about 30 minutes. Get off at the Boccadasse stop. The seafront area near the church is really lovely.",
          "This was a gorgeous little fishing village, with stunning views, definitely worth a visit. It is quite hilly, with steep climbs to vantage points, so might not be all that suitable for the older or more unsteady on their feet. We got a bus there and back at 3 euros for the",
          "Small but lovely village. I recommend to go there very early to avoid the crowd. OR go around sunset for the best pictures.",
          "Worth a visit. Few places to eat and drink in this little fishing village. Quite hilly so not really good for people unsteady on their feet",
          "this place was my wifes suggestion and it was really fantastic. it was kinda hard to get to (the parking traffic was just crazy) but once we were finally here, it was great. you really have to visit to understand this quiet little beach inlet in the middle of this busy city.",
          "You think you're ready for it after seeing the pictures, but it's still amazing i had the luck of being there while someone was playing recent songs on a guitar, No Surprises for example, it fit surprisingly well with the setting.",
          "Well worth the walk along the Corso Italia promenade. Don't miss the ice cream when you get there. Forget the rest.",
          "Lovely little seaside place. Originally I wanted to go to the Lido but after the entrance fee, transat, parasol and cabine the cost was \u20ac20. It was extremely busy so I decided to go by the harbour and used the pebble little beach for free! As it is a bit dangerous with stones",
          "We went to Boccadasse walking from the centre of Genova (don\u2019t recommend if it\u2019s 29 degrees...) and the town was super cute. There\u2019s a lovely ice cream bar right in the corner of the beach. The beach was very clean and it\u2019s a great calm place to sunbath or swim.",
          "Amazing and beautiful place hidden in the rocks. A perfect place to sit with a drink and admire the costline and sun. Filled with few small restaurants where you can have tasty seafood. Or just sit on the stones with a cold drink.",
          "Boccadasse is a small, old fishing village in the suburbs of Genoa, a short bus ride along the coastline. We probably didn\u2019t visit on the best day as the weather was poor, it was very wet. Not really that much to see here. Quite pretty and set into the hillside rocks with a few",
          "My partner and I came here for a few cheeky wines and we loved it very quaint and colourful worth a visit for sure.",
          "We walked from the centre of Genoa to Boccadasse mainly because of the Montalbano connection. Luckily it was a beautiful day for a walk because, to be honest, Boccadasse isn\u2019t worth the effort! Yes, it\u2019s pretty but not as lovely as some of the other fishing villages around.",
          "overrated location, nothing special at all. You'll find not anything the postcard themes promised to you",
          "The cutest beach ever! Tiny and hidden away from the fast pace city of Genoa. Mostly locals. Went to have cocktails and enjoy the fresh air. Great to sit and people watch too.",
          "A 20 min bus ride from city center. While Boccadasse is much more than the oft photographed beach, this beach is the perfectly place to soak up the Mediterranean sun and ambiance. Small windy footpaths add fun and mystery while exploring this area. A great place to have lunch -",
          "We took a stroll from central Genoa to Boccadasse for a change of scene on the Sunday of our weekend trip. The walk took a good hour but a flat and pleasant stroll largely along the seafront promenade, Corsa Italia. The place itself (at least the pretty old bit) was smaller than",
          "This place is quiet a charming, you can just sit back, grab a beer and just relax there. You can get a good sunset view if you are at the right time. If you like taking pics, you can spend as much time as you want capturing all the colorful buildings with the blue water and blue",
          "It is a beautiful place of Genova. There are a few colourful house which makes the landscape even more perfect.",
          "a very pretty little cove with quaint, old houses scrambling up the rocks around it. Well worth the short trip from Genova for a walk along the seafront, especially at sunset.",
          "I walked from the NH Collection Marina hotel. Took about an hour each way, I went out hugging as close to the coast as I could though this means you walk by elevated busy roads for about 20 minutes. I preferred the route back which was to walk along the Corso then cut through",
          "se siete in visita a Genova non portete non pasare da Boccadasse. If you are visiting Genova you have to pass by Boccadasse.",
          "While staying in Genova, we went to this village upon the recommendation of our hotel (as well as TripAdvisor). From Old Town Genova, the walk was a leisurely 45-60 a minute stroll along the seaside. (You can also opt to take the #42 bus from Piazza Ferrari or next to Casa Di",
          "Gorgeous fishing village, a must see on your visit to Genoa. We took the local bus, enjoyed the breathtaking view with a Spritzer!",
          "Not lot of tourists were out when we walked down to Boccadesse,mostly locals doing their own things.It made it much more special,we got to expirience how life is trough the whole year is for locals.",
          "Nice walk from the city center to this quaint sea-front ! Locals and visitors alike sipping a glass of wine by the sea in a colorfull atmosphere !",
          "We were in Genoa for Christmas, and since we are both great fans of Montalbano we opted for a nice morning walk out to Boccadasse. We walked along the great (and paved) lido that goes all the way along the coast from the fairground out to Boccadasse, and passes a lot of the",
          "Really charming fishing village with cute shops and great local food. Beautiful church, small, rocky beach - bring your suit and towel! Lots of photo opportunities. We found a bus (cannot quite remember the number-ask at your hotel. The stop was near Chris Columbus house) and it",
          "It's a very small take on Cinque Terre, but not that different, small cottages and a nice bay. Good option for a short bus trip!",
          "Boccadasse is one of my fave spots in Genova. Not just because I live near there, but the colorful old buildings, the stones and rocks, the alleys that lead you to a small castle and an higher point to enjoy sunset....everything makes this pictoresque area so unique. I would",
          "a great spot that we found in our trip in Italian Riviera. great views, atmosphere and ideally situated. perfect for romance or to enjoy some drinks contemplating the views",
          "Bocadasse can be visited by a 45 minute walk along the boulevard from Genova. While slightly overrated as #1 attraction, the old fishing village definitely has some authentic charm and cosines. Few restaurants and bars along a small pebbles beach. Some houses lack proper",
          "Even if it is not located in the main centre of Genova, there is a great view from here. It is also a very romantic and unique place.",
          "This is where the most beautiful costline on earth begins. You can see for miles on a clear day and it is breathtaking",
          "A very nice addition to a Genova visit! Very cute beach and a great view of the sea! Boccadasse is not far away from Genova, easily reached by bus or by foot over the Cross Italia.",
          "Enjoy it at sunset. Coulored small houses in a cozy and welcoming place. From here people left for argentina, building the famous Boca district in buones aired.",
          "This is a very hip - and pricey - neighborhood of Genoa, adjoining the seafront on the city's eastern end. The wide sidewalks make for excellent strolling, especially in the afternoon, when nice sunsets can be seen. Ice cream and small bars abound, as do people, which makes it",
          "Sorry to say that this seems overrated. You have to take the bus and then walk to get to a very small area where there is a rocky beach and few terraces. Nervi way better, just don't get down from the bus and it will be worth it.",
          "Must see in GENOVA. Nice fish restaurants close to shore. A nice, peaceful and relaxing place... You can even swim there in summer season...",
          "Boccadasse is a tiny little pearl, a gorgeous mini-harbor ringed by hillside houses, lovely cafes, fishing boats and a tiny pebbled beach. Lovely by day, it is positively electric by night as tourists (mostly Italian) mingle with locals on the piazza, the seaside bars, the",
          "Nothing crazy about it, it's a bit expensive, but if you don't have much time in Genoa and you want to a taste of the villages near the sea, this port is good for a break from the city. If you go by night, note that the buses are different during the day and during the night.",
          "Beautiful little bay with everything needed for a relaxing break. Easy transport to the sights of Genoa and the Italian Riviera when feeling more active.",
          "incontournable, unmissable. always, at any time, in any case. just go, and see by yourselves. I'd recommend getting yourself a drink before dining, or later on, and enjoying it right on the pebble beach",
          "I will write this for international tourists especially: Just GO TO SEE THIS BEAUTY. It's a simple beach, apparently nothing incredibile, but I always found there a magic atmosphere and an authentic italian feeling. Just go to spend some time there, it's worth seeing!",
          "I spent little time in Bocadasse the and sight seeing is nice but there little to see there. Also seems to be a more residential area around with sea walk but did not habe time to explore. It is 10 mimutes bu bus form genova centre close to Opera bus stop take line 42. So it",
          "Place is absolutely adorable! Worth to sea, can also go to swim. Is not a sandy beach but we saw lots of families with babies and kids there: swimming, playing around and having fun. Small bar-pizzeria at the seaside is perfect to have lunch next to the sea and sea food is",
          "It's the place for locals - fishermen place, nice colourful buildings around and church with the belfry.",
          "Nice little town close to Genova. Small beaches with pebbles (like most beaches in the area). Spend 2-3 hours and you have seen most of it. Start in the centre by the beach ( That is where that famous \"Genoa by the sea with the nice coloured houses\" picture is taken)",
          "Lovely village atmosphere on the outskirts of Genoa, find yourself a table at a restaurant next to the beach and just relax as you people watch. Folks seemed to gather to eat and drink on the pebble beach till late in the night creating a wonderful atmosphere as locals and",
          "The famous coloured houses at the sea picture is taken in Boccadasse. Some smaller pebble beaches, mostly locals.",
          "Small but nice place. I would recommend going at sunset time for the aperitivo! Excellent view. Decent food.",
          "What a lovely place! If you want to eat, make sure you reserve a seat! We recommend the Aperol spritz and the little fishy thingies in a bag.",
          "take a long walk along promenade to here- gorgeous and the restaurants are wonderful on the seaside. Everyone sits and buys a glass of wine outside",
          "Incredibly friendly shops. Small secluded beach. Great food. Beautiful walk along the promenade morning or night! Ittiturismo Boccadasse halfway down the hill to the beach from the church. Say hello to Mario and Luigi!!!",
          "Where the locals while their time away. Great atmosphere with nice bars and gelaterias. We went at night time and it was buzzing. Very close to the corso so very convenient to where we were staying. The buildings and architecture were great too. We found this a great",
          "We took the 42 bus to Boccadasse ( 1.50 Euros return) and had a wonderful day. The promenade gives you lovely views of the sea and you begin to appreciate Genoa and its surrounds much more. Boccadasse itself has a little pebbled beach in the Cinque Terre style and is in many",
          "Beautiful scenery I really enjoyed coming here and will definitely return got some beautiful photos!",
          "After a 6 km walk from the harbour in Genoa, I was looking forward to visiting this small fishing village. I had read so much about it and how fabulous it was! Well I have seen much prettier villages in Italy by a mile. The actual \" fishing village is quite small with a few",
          "It was sad to see how much trash was left around and in a water. Horrifying, - that it was NOT locals, but tourists who behave as a pigs...",
          "Went based on reviews on T/A, and was disappointed. We came in on a cruise and walked from the port. The walk is about 6km or 4 miles. The first part of the walk was through the port (very nice), middle section was through busy vehicle area, and the final section was on Corso",
          "Here is a very beautiful beach for swimming inside the city.. and the view..was amazing!!!We just loved it!",
          "Personally find it looks a little like cinque terre, just much less touristy. Beaches are a little small, but overall not too bad!!",
          "We walked here from the centre of Genova which took around 30 mins. The Corsa is a pleasant sea front walk with cafes and restaurants you can stop off in. Boccadasse is a pleasant small fishing village with a pretty bay and small stony beach. It has a feel of the cinque terre",
          "Nice view of the city. A good place for sun bath but the beach is covered with stones so you need special shoes. Verry good food and best gelatto!!!",
          "Must see. Has one of the oldest most famous ice cream shops in Genoa. Good in the evening, grab an ice cream and watch the sea",

          "Really nice to visit because the view is beautiful with the colourful tiny houses, the sea and the rocks. The atmosphere is also really special ! It's something you should defently see even if it takes about 25 minutes with public transport to go there (starting in the historic",
          "I took the advice from the Internet and went there in a Sunday morning only to find a very little place with few things to do. It has a small cobbled beach, two or three bars with a few tables outside to drink a coffee or eat something and a little street you can walk around",
          "From the pictures on the internet looks beautiful but in the reality it's one of the places that I regret I have visited. No space, no restaurants, no bars...the beach is more full of stones than of the sea water. Disgusting, I do not recommend to go there- wasted time.",
          "A city within the city! A little local fishermens housing, small houses, small resturants and great local food. Small beach but not with sand, small stones and rocks. Fishing boats, seagulls, mild breeze and sunset!! Well worth a stroll, a stay and enjoy this little pearl within",
          "A charming little fishing village at the end of the waterfront walk. Colorful houses adorn the hillside. A small rocky beach. Very scenic. Good gelato.",
          "We visited the Boccadasse in what should have been its height of activity -- a beautiful sunny afternoon in July -- and yet the place was nearly completely dead. It's a beautiful scene to look at, no doubt about it, but don't come here expecting to see busy sidewalk cafes or",
          "Arrived Genoa on a cruise ship and asked a taxi driver to take us to a beach and somewhere we could get lunch. He recommend this gem of a place called Boccadasse, with a small beach settled among a very special scenic Italian backdrop. There were a number of local restaurants",
          "Very pretty. Great options for gelato. The sea breeze is refreshing and the views are spectacular. Watch the sunset and head to Listeria Delhi artisti for an amazing dinner.",
          "we stayed in downtown Genoa, and decided the walk to Boccadasse was a bit much so we rented a scooter - which I can definitely recommend doing. The views are gorgeous and quintessentially Italian. If you want to enjoy a drink at one of the local pubs, be sure to bring cash and",
          "Beautiful little beach next to the town. Good restaurants close and Ice cream place right next to the beach. Not easy to park",
          "This is how Genoa would have looked a few centuries ago.Has the passage of time forgotten it? Well, yes and no. It is the fierce love and spirit of independence of its inhabitants who put up a fight to keep it as it is that achieved this miracle, to keep a tiny romantic",
          "A little fishers' village beneath the centre of Genoa, simply amazing, wonderful. The house are very colourful and in a small gelateria I ate one of the best ice cream of my life! Worth a visit!",
          "Walking around the steep little roads sounded by the small coloured houses typical of the ligurian old fishing villages is a unique experience. Boccadasse is an old gift left intact inside the town of Genoa. Worth a visit!",
          "We took the train out to Nervi and walked all the way back to our hotel in genoa near principe. Im so glad we started in Nervi as the view walking back was so much more beautiful than boccadesse itself. The walk from boccadesse back to principe was the worst as it was motorways",
          "Definitely a place to visit when I'm Genoa. Had fish by the sea and enjoyed the great view Boccadasse had to offer!",
          "This is not just the best and most beautiful place in Genova, but one of the most unique places in Italy. You surely know \"5 Terre\", so this place is kind of the same without the huge amount of tourists that go to 5 Terre. If you like to have a Gelatto or Aperitivo, it is one of",

          "We walked the promenade and looked for a nice place to sit in Boccadasse for a white wine. We were turned away from all of the nice patio restaurants because we weren't eating, just wanted a drink. Lovely little fishing town with a feel of Cinque Terre, but walkable. Would",
          "Nothing to say: if you're visiting Genoa or Ligury in general, you cannot miss this touching bay. It's the right balance of colours, sounds and smells. It's also a great place for an aperitif after work in order to relax!",
          "If you have seen all the usual tourist stuff in Genoa and have half a day to spare then catch the bus from Stazione Brignole to Boccadasse.. You can walk up past the harbour to admire the views towards the Portofino Peninsula. Then walk back to the village, ignore the overpriced",
          "Despite the concern of the Tourist Office it is worth walking to Boccadasse as there is a promenade along the coast with a number of bars and cafes and it is a pleasant walk which takes under an hour from Stazione Brignole - otherwise get the 31 bus as opposed to the 42 bus as",
          "We've gone to see a bit of a sea on our trip and even we didn't expect, we had a swim and sunbathing on a beach. If I could I would order accommodation at this place so I could spend more time here. We visited few restaurants and I have to say the staff was very kind and",
          "There's lots of restaurants and bars and when the sun is shining it's packed full of locals with friends and family. Lovely views to accompany good conversation.",
          "Decided to visit whilst visiting Genoa based on other trip advisor reviews. We walked from Genoa centre along Corso Italia, nice easy walking along seafront with lots of views and places to stop for refreshments. Boccadasse was tiny and busy, we were a little underwhelmed",
          "It's a cute little town with awesome ice cream and a little spiaggia. Good focaccia and frozen yogurt!!",
          "Very small rocky beach with few restaurants. Lots of stairs to climb. Had to take a taxi back to train station after bus ride.",
          "Boccadasse is a good replacament if you don't have time to go to Cinque Terre. Another great quiet(and close to centre) spot next to the sea if you're tired of city life. Yet if you want to go to the beach you need to find a less rocky one :)",
          "Great to get away from the bustle of the port in Genoa We eventually found the bus to take us (number 31 or 42 ) one and a half euros for a single ticket. Remember to by from a tobacconist shop as you cannot buy a ticket on board. Very quaint fishing village not dissimilar to",
          "a corner of ligurian cinque terre in the middle of Genova. an amazing place with beautiful sea where to spend a lunch or a dinner",
          "It's suitable for family, married couple, and couples in general and friends. Wanna grab a beer by Boccadasse? Why not. Wanna grab an ice cream there? Why not. Wanna just chill? Why not :)",
          "Nice little village/ town 20 min by local suburban train - good to stop over on the way (back from) Genoa Nervi (the sea promenade of which is by far more picturesque and breath-taking). Nice to have a glass of beer or wine on the seashore - but prices for dinner are generally",
          "The beach itself is nothing too spectacular, however the large rocks to the side of it are a cute place to relax by the sea and enjoy a stunning view of the mountainside. Great for couples.",
          "The walk to Boccadasse from the center of Genoa gave us different views of the area and it helped us to see how the locals enjoy the beach areas. Boccadasse is a charming hilly area with small restaurants and colorful houses.",
          "We visited here for the day and walked along the promenade from where we were staying in Genoa! A beautiful little spot to spend the day at - we had focaccia and beer from the local bakery (would highly recommend!) and then spent the rest of the afternoon lay around on the",
          "There's nothing there - it's not even particularly pretty. Luckily our visit was saved by a lovely restaurant called Capo Santa Chiaro. Go there to eat, but don't expect much from the \"village\"",
          "Right on the see, for pedestrians only, this tiny village right out of Genoa, is a beautiful lively place indeed! Take a walk around its old streets, enjoy the great view and have some nice seafood at one of the several restaurants by the sea! My favorite? \"La Cambusetta\"!",
          "Loved this place, the beach is beautiful, the restaurants lovely, the aperitivo tasty and generous. One of my favourite spots in Genoa.",
          "A short and spectacular drive from Genova along the coast, this place is worth visiting in the late afternoon or early evening. Have a stroll on the beach, then sip an aperitivo enjoying the view from the surrounding bars. If you've read the Detective Montalbano novels (or",
          "An extremely lively part of Genova where you can experience an old fisherman port with very lively way of life",
          "We traveled here a year ago and it was one of the loveliest places I have ever been. The cove is surrounded by beautiful old buildings. The sea is warm and clean and clear. Old ladies from the surrounding town come and bob about like seals during weekdays. Our little daughter",
          "Arrived in Genoa midweek and was only informed of Via XX Settembre in terms of destination and places to visit but discovered Boccadasse whilst browsing along the port and i can only say this area must be visited!",
          "We walked from Genoa to this lovely part of Genoa. It was a lovely walk and the views were breathtaking. The colours were amazing. We found it an easy walk with plenty to see and do. We went into a lovely church with the most stunning stained glass windows! There are plenty of",
          "Walked from main station in Genoa to Boccadasse with my daughter. Took nearly 2 hours but a pleasant walk especially along Corso Italia. Village is tiny but very attractive. A few bars and restaurants but these were busy so we didn't try any. Little winding streets are cute.",
          "This area is next to Genova, around 20 minutes with the bus from city center. It's village with some small beaches. We walk through town, next to the shore. At the smallest beach there are some bars. Prices are more expensive here, had a beer for 4 euros at a snackbar! Better",
          "This is maybe one of the best thing to see in Genova. This former little fishermen area used to be one of the poorest of town, and those last years became one of the most requested places to live in...go get lost in the small streets and stairs, the area is amazing and gets to",
          "Ate aperitifos in small bar on front before moving onto Osvaldo. Beautiful pebble beach with small bay surrounded by old fashioned trattoria.",
          "It's an OK village, not really worth the high rank on trip advisor... After spending 40 minutes looking for a parking space (parked almost 2 miles away from the beach), the actual spot turned out to be a little dissapointing. Far too crowded, very small beach, not too",
          "Spent the day sitting outside having a drink in Boccadasse. Great atmosphere and very beautiful. I can't wait to go back!",
          "Great spot for a 1/2 day excursion. Up and down through the old town. Try get closer to the sea thought alleys. Nervi is another option not too far away.",
          "Many tour book suggest taking public transportation but we did the visit walking from the train station. It's a beautiful 45mins walk if u don't stop in between, we started from Inside the city and passing many nice places like key shopping area, flea markets, neighbour coffee",
          "We came here with freinds for dinner in a local restaurant and posed for photos on this picturesque part of the Italian coast.",
          "After a stroll in the old town we had a quick peek in Boccadasse - now I have two different versions of Genoa! Boccadasse seemed so idyllic, although it was very windy when we were there (well, November...) but I could imagine this a great place to have lunch and gelato during",
          "It is a beautiful place to take pictures. The city it is not so nice, dirty places, and old houses and restaurantes ...",
          "We walked here from Genoa (it takes 45 minutes - or you can take the bus). It's a very quaint fishing village surrounded by bars and restaurants. It's a lovely place to go on a sunny day",
          "A quaint little beach surrounded by colourful buildings. Locals sit on chairs, have coffee and watch the fisherman come in...in morning Catch the local bus and ask driver where to get off...you need to go down a couple of paths..but it is worth it.",
          "Very nice and relaxing place to see the sea and have a coffee, to spend a afternoon in silence. Very helpful people and nice ice cream nearby,",
          "The hour was late, so we took a taxi to the Piazza Nettuno in Bocadesse where we had dinner reservations. It was Sunday evening before sunset. Taxis are plentiful in Genoa, go by the meter, do not expect a tip, and are quite reasonably priced. Of course walking is cheaper, and",
          "situated about 20 minutes from the town center,this colourful ancient mariners village is a definite must, good view of the sea, local bars very cool and trendy, great ice cream as only italians know how to make them, and friendly people to chat to. A lovely walk, even through",
          "Just 15 minutes bus ride from the central of Genoa and you find yourself in a totally different environment. This is a very calm fisherman's village. We liked it very much.",
          "You have to take a bus from the city center to this neighborhhood, but it is well worth the visit even though it is very small yet picturesque.",
          "Proloco Maris Boccadasse A pleasant location easily reached by local transport, bus in our case. We were lucky with the weather and enjoyed the various changing palettes painted by a falling sun during one late afternoon in Genova. We would recommend it for its relaxing",
          "Maybe jollier in July , but in October A very Sad looking grey long forgotten seaside town . Had a quick espresso at a very unfriendly cafe , then straight back to the bus stop to Genova which I waited ages for - not somewhere I would recommend at all.",
          "Fully preserved fishing village surrounded by the city. Charming and very pretty with a good selection of restaurants and bars serving snacks. Fishing boats on the beach and a local angling club add proper fishing atmosphere",
          "Let yourself be involved by the colourful buildings. Grab an aperitivo and enjoy the sunset. There are a few restaurants where you can appreciate a romantic dinner.",
          "Another small village by the sea that you can find along the Italian coast line. I went there on a Monday afternoon, so it was very quiet. There were a few sunbathers on the beach. Small lanes characterize the village which is very picturesque.",
          "This promised so much from the pictures and write-ups, but it was really disappointing. There's so much opportunity to do something with the beautiful location, but it seems like the locals have just given up on the place. It was dirty and just felt so run down. I'm not",
          "beautiful piece of italy, nice athmosphere, nice view points over the bay, possibilities to dine or have a drink",
          "We took a short bus journey here. It was a lovely walk along the seafront , very quiet , with some fine buildings.- but not a lot was open so it is really for a short visit. We went there because we are fans of Montalbano and its author and Livia lives here . So it was good to",
          "Unless you want to sat there for a day for sunbathing, plan a 10-15 minute stop at Boccadasse. It surely has a good scenery, but the place is so small and there are only a couple of restaurants with high prices, you just don't have anything to do there.",
          "Average coastal village that provides a pleasant place for a rest. Prices are tourist-adjusted but the gelataria is very good. Small beach with space for maybe 15 people, but I wouldn't recommend a swim because the water is quite dirty/polluted.",
          "We took a bus out specifically for this area. Unfortunately due to time constraints we weren't able to stay long. We choose to do the walk back along the sea which was beautiful and scenic, although very hot in the mid afternoon sun. We were a bit confused as to where the walk",
          "I have been to this place with my freind when we where looking for a swim. I could'nt even imagine that this is Genova to, But the place have a direct-sea acces and offers plenty of restaurants in a medeterianian 'hyped' atmosphere. However, Its good that a city have something",
          "it is a quaint little colourful village surrounded by an open sea and a small rocky beach. it may not be as spectacular as some fishing villages in France, but does have a certain charm. won't say that it is a must visit though...if one has extra time to walk around, then fine.",
          "I love it there! A beautiful view. A little far from La Spezia, but worth the drive. It's a fisherman's village with a small beach and lots of apartments with restaurants and a couple of ice cream shops. Loved the church, too.",
          "Having walked between two of the Cinque Terre Villages last year when stopping at La Spezia, Boccadasse doesn't remotely compare. Wouldn't have bothered if we had known how little and unspectacular it was, the only positive was the lovely Gellateria right by the pebble, seaweed",
          "Smaller than I hoped and a bit tired. Worth a visit but lower your expectations and you won't be as disappointed as I was",
          "We went here from Cinque Terre. The place is sort of like it with the colored houses and the beach. Thanks to Ki Point luggage deposit from the train station that we were able to ask information to get here. Take the bus number 31 to Italia 6: Boccadasse. It's 1.50\u20ac. The locals",
          "I went to see my friend who is on boat and we decide to go to see Boccadasse, we stayed whole afternoon, eat pizza and drink beers there. It was really good place and we enjoyed.",
          "We stayed very near Boccadasse for two weeks.A superb little beach to swim in(buy some plastic shoes as stony), good restaurants, a lovely walk round to Sturla ,magnificent views over the sea from S Antonio, and the start of the lovely Corsa Italia.",
          "It is full of colorful pastel houses and nice villas with private beaches. The church, the castle the restaurant, the gelateria and the beach fulfill the description of a typical seaside village in Liguria",
          "If you go on Sunday there is a huge market along the Corso Italia en route to Boccadasse. If you don't fancy the walk then take bus 18 from the port area to Brignoles Bus station then change to bus 31. Bus ticket unlimited travel on any for up to 100 minutes for 1E50. Buy",
          "Walked along the coastal promenade from central Genoa. about a 10 kms round trip. Central Genoa consists of a huge port area and very old buildings. As you get away from the centre the buildings are of a similar style but newer. There are large parks / gardens & as you follow",
          "Good place to visit. Right in the \"end\" of the Genoa city centre, it worth a visit. Very traditional area with some good places for photography.",
          "Took 31 bus from Brignole to go to a local restaurant. Bus stops just at beach. When we went it was a little wild but it made the place so rugged and beautiful. Lovely coloured houses though some in need of repaint. The waves were so high I wonder do they get some flooding at",
          "One of the most popular spot in Genova, old fishermen houses, really characteristic and truly Mediterranean. The blue of the sea, the vivid colours of the houses create a magic atmosphere. Try the \"semifreddo\" by Amedeo Bar, a kind of an ice cream, but not totally \"ice\",",
          "Great setting but in need of some work. Also try Nervi and Quatro. All 3 seaside towns are close together and can be done in a day trip from Genoa by trains, bus or car. Walk, swim, go boating - all 3 are quaint and quiet and very charming.",
          "I have visited it only because of Tripadviser certificate of excellence. Total disappointment. Three lines road full of cars driving at the side of Promenade. I cannot call It relaxing, beautiful , romantic, fresh sea breeze walk. I would go there only I had no choice. May be I",
          "Just two km far away from the city center, it seems to be in another time and space. The little romantic beach, crowed at the \"aperitivo\" time, but very quiet during the weekly days is a perfect way out to the mess of the city. Take a coffee or a bier on the little bar just in",
          "We took the bus to Boccadasse, visited some of the really picturesque villages on the coastline and walked back to Genoa (about 30 minutes). A wonderful walk that gives you a idea of the way the rich Genovese lived on the coast, the way the culture of sun bathing is practised,",
          "If u r in Genova for business and you have to spent a weekend there, do not miss it! Visit this place for a peaceful, relaxing Sunday. U may also have a nice dinner in restaurant just at the shore and taste delicious seafood. Highly recommended! You will not regret...",
          "Beautiful little coastal town. Great views from the ocean front - just ahead of where the bus stops. Could swim here if the water was good as most of the beaches along the coastline are not public and have been blocked-off by hotels and recreational sites who charge an access",
          "We stop with the car there, very beautiful view , very quiet and refreshing ) the beach is with stones so expect sand)!!!!",
          "I hadn't seen the photo of the beach that we wanted to spend some relaxing time at (that pretty photo that appears in the heading above) until I went to write my review. Yes, that little triangle in the lower left side of the picture is the \"beach\". It is a rock beach and was",
          "We went to Boccadasse on a friends recommendation. It is a beautiful place easily accessable by public transport (bus) from the Piazza Ferrari. Walking along the small roads and narrow alleys is just wonderful. And don't forget to stop for some lovely food in one of the",
          "An old fishermen village now refurbished, it offers great restaurants and ice creams bars. A very dramatic view on the mediterranean sea is possible after a little walk up in the higher part of the village in \"via di capo santa chiara\". Absolutely a must.",
          "Very nice and pictoresque village, with a small beach and many restaurants around it. Just 20 minutes from the centre.",
          "Sounded quaint and wonderful but the reality was that it was too commercialised and heaving with shops full of 'tourist tat'. Parking was a major issue and there was very little to see of the original fishing village and its history.",
          "Picturesque little village by the sea. Some nice cafes where you can sit and have coffee and food while enjoying the sea view. Go uphill to enjoy view of the village from above and see the colourful houses.",
          "Maybe it was off-season (April), but there was not much happening here on a Friday afternoon. Sure, there was a decent photo opp with the colorful houses, cove, and coastline in the background, but I don't see this place as a \"must\" for first-time Genoa visitors in town for a",
          "Nice view, amazing atmosphere. One of the best place to visit in genova and where spend time in any moment of the day! Full of restaurant and bars (some of them good!)!",
          "Boccadasse is a suburb of Genoa, but the original fishing village element has somehow survived and if you want to have a plate of pasta or a slice of focaccia at the water's edge, this is about the only place you can do it in Genoa. It means a bus ride, but it's direct and only",
          "There was lots of good reviews so went to take a look. It a pleasant bus ride from town. However, there is not much there apart from a few restaurants and the pastel houses. It was pretty but didn't live up to the positive reviews offered by ithwrs.",
          "A real waste of time as the place is small and rundown with scaffolding spoiling any photos. Lots of rubbish around.",
          "Walked the huge distance from Genoa along the promenade from central Genoa... And quite honestly it's run down, grey stony beach with a few restaurants ... What else can I say ... Oh yes go to portofino instead . ( sorry locals )",
          "This is a nice place to chill and sit there to eat an icecream. many people and loud there. Cool stones at the beach to play for kids",
          "Boccadasse is a magic little village in the heart of Genova. Follow the promenade named Corso Italia toward east and yu will end up there.",
          "We walked here from the hotel grand savoia, it's a good long walk, once out of the port area and onto the sea front it's a nice walk, coming from North Yorkshire we have lots of beautiful small fishing villages so kind of expected the same, I was disappointed, don't get me wrong",
          "Boccadasse is just a walk along the harbor from central Genoa. The view is unbeatable. The water was incredibly clear and warm enough to take a dip (if you are accustomed to colder temperatures than what is typical in Genoa). There are plenty of places to eat- just be wary of",
          "Takes about an hour to an hour and a half depending whereabouts in Genoa you start your walk. Try if possible to walk partly through the city and then down to the coast as if you start from the port you'll find a route enveloped in lorries on all sides, dirty, noisy and dull.",
          "If you're in Genoa and you have also some luck and you can join the city on the weekend, this is the place you cannot miss. Just 5 minutes from Downtown you'll be amazed by the view you'll have while you'll be eating some Focaccia, or having the typical 'Aperitivo' in front of",
          "We visited in late February. Notwithstanding the cold, Boccadasse is the most lovely little coastal town. No visit to Genoa is complete without it!",
          "I spent a lovely afternoon strolling down Corso di Italia to Boccadasse. You can keep the \"Lover's Walk\" in Cinque Terre clotted with tourists... I'll take this one with joggers, bikers, families, old couples strolling hand in hand, and some lovely little bars at the end for a",
          "Looks like a picture - very good place for some photos while visiting Genoa. Not that good when you come closer to the small houses and coast - restaurants are not very recommended because of overrated prices. I visited this place in January so I believe that in summer eveything",
          "Visiting the Boccadasse is a must-do while in Genova. It's about an hour walk (I recommend walking on the path that follows the coast) from the center of Genova, or you can take a bus. Though it was cloudy and rainy the day we visited, the views were still beautiful. There",
          "very nice place to walk to, through the corso italia promenade, just 20 minutes from the fair. very good ice cream!! next would like to sleep in a beautifull little b&b we saw close to the beach.",
          "Extraordinary beautiful old fishing village that is full of character and home to delightful restaurants. Just watch the waves splash on the rocks or the sunset.",
          "It is a nice place to spend some quality time. I fell in love with this place. Everyone should visit it.",
          "We walked from the old town and it is a walk worth doing - about 5km, but lots to see along the way from shops to parks to palaces and then to the beach on a sparkling winter's day. Once there, there are photos to take and lunch to be had; there are a number of options from",
          "Located at the outskirts of Genova, but very easy to reach by bus (#31) leaving from Brignole. It is a small fishing village, bay, with few restaurants, resembling the cinque terre villages at a smaller scale. Nice location to end your walk on Corso Italia promenade.",
          "A beautiful little bay with brightly coloured buildings on the cliff face. This bay was close to our hotel and worth the short walk to see it.",
          "Several years ago it was quiet bay, nice and very romantic. Now, unfortunately, it is the well-known point of interest for all tourists who walk along Corsa Italia. Restaurants and Cafes appeared and become greedy. I think there is being done millions of identical \u201cclassical\u201d",
          "we visited on a rainy winter day - and even then, it was very beautiful. Not to be missed when in Genoa.",
          "We ventured to Boccadasse because it was described as being similar to the Cinque Terra villages, only less touristy. It was very small, and the only real similarity to the Cinque Terra towns was the colour of the buildings, but they were not in as good a state of repair. The",
          "I came in december and it was somewhat grey out, but not raining. The place was exactly buzzing with life, which i think took away from the atmosphere of the place. I went there as it was #1 on Tripadvisor, but definitely doesnt deserve to be",
          "You should go see Boccadasse if you are in Genoa. You can find there a very nice restaurant (Osteria di Osvaldo). I've lived in Genoa for 2 years and there you can find the best seafood and one of the best ice cream (everybody loves a good gelato). The view it's extraordinary.",
          "This a get place to see in Genoa. The houses just next to the see show an unique scenario which is very typical of Genoa.",
          "Take this passegiatta from Genova to Boccadasse in an afternoon, better on weekends. Full of people, huge italian families. Good views of the sea. At colourful Boccadasse relax with a gelato or a beer and see the sun set over the city",
          "A very picturesque place to observe and explore. The lack of paint on some houses is part of its charm.",
          "A perfect urban beach, very quiet and not too populated. Unless you have a problem with the pebbles and rocks, this is the ideal place to spend your morning in Genoa, whether you want to tan, swim or only sit and read a book.",
          "We caught the 31 bus from centre of town using the free bus travel with our museum tickets. This dropped us on the promenade right above the beach at this beautiful fishing village. A perfect place to watch the sun set. You can walk back towards Genoa along the promenade, or get",
          "Swim off the rocks here and sample some seafood if the restaurant over the bay is open. The water is clear, but seaweed and driftwood can build up. The beach is small but you should still find room to catch some sun in this sheltered spot, there is a road right down to the beach",
          "Charming, unbelievably beautiful town just a few miles from the center of Genoa. We took the bus down the coast and it was about a 20 minutes journey - extremely easy! Walk down to the water and have a panini and glass of wine or a gelato (or both!). This is a",
          "We spent an afternoon here. In mid October there were two swimmers, one with a wetsuit, one without. There were also two snorkelers, looking for items to harvest from the sea. If we had our swim suits, we would have gotten in for a swim.",
          "This is one of the most beautiful places in Genoa, I have been here many times, most of the cases were during always weekend evenings. Boccadasse positioned instill Corso Italia, the old town is really very far walk from there. But it is worth visiting this little corner of the",
          "If you go to genoa that are not much beachs around.... But if yougo to bocadasse, you can swim in peace. Its a beach where locals go and its so nice. Good restaurants in the area",
          "Compared to many other similar inlets/beaches eg between Nice and Genova and Cinqueterre, Boccadasse is a poor cousin and certainly not worthy of the mantle of Genova's No. 1 attraction. There are many iconic attractions in Genova itself before taking the 31 bus for a half hour",
          "It's very easy to reach Boccadasse from the town centre so, don't miss the chance to take a stroll and enjoy an icecream watching seagulls as the sun sets!",
          "A delightful change from the busy city center! Easy commute on the bus! Fantastic views, fantastic gelato!",
          "A nice way to spend a few hours. You can take a short bus ride to Boccadasse from Genova. Go at sunset. Eat some seafood at one of the casual places up the street from the beach, walk on the promenade with your gelato and enjoy your visit to the beach.",
          "Great place for a swim in the little harbour Boccadasse free of duty and relaxed. better the all the payed beton beaches from Genua.",
          "Go there and enjoy the scene of the houses. You can eat gelato there and enjoy looking at the sea. A walk in Corso italia next to it is a bliss",
          "A beautiful place, but be aware of som important things. Most of the beach is private or clubs. You have to spend most of your budget to get access. If there should be anything left, the restaurants would be happy to take care of it. The prices are high and a cup of coffee could",
          "Lovely location, quite charming, but a small little beach. We ate a cone of fried calamari and anchovies from a small shop along the stairs..they were really good, for 10E. Then we had a few wines and beers at the Dindi restaurant, on the sidewalk. Lovely. Had a real nice visit.",
          "Manage your expectations if you\u2019re coming here; it\u2019s not Portofino, Cinque Terre or a beach resort. What it is however, is a beautiful, old Italian fishing village that\u2019s a little rough round the edges, although I think that\u2019ll change very soon!",
          "I wonderful old fisherman's borg, amazing to have a dinner or an ice cream here. It's a little bit far from the city center, but the place be worth the trip.",
          "Tiny old fishing village now engulfed by the sprawl of Genoa. Like a smaller, faded Cinque Terre village. A few restaurants and a couple of cheaper pizza/panini places plus two gelato shops. OK for a brief visit, lunch and a gelato.",
          "Glad we went there. Had a lovely lunch and walk around the village. There are several restaurants to choose from. The old part of the village is just a few narrow streets, but full of character.",
          "It's an ugly beach with no sand, just stones, which make it no fun to soak the sun. Going there is a total waste of time and there isn't even a nice view.",
          "Now trendy evening eating place in Genoa; great for a dinner, there are a number of venues to choose from, but DO end with an ice cream in the oldest ice cream parlous in the region.",
          "Walked here from the port area of Genoa- at first unpleasant along a very busy main road, but once on the Corso Italia it was much more agreeable. Boccadasse itself has an attractive setting, a few bars and restaurants and a small beach.",
          "This is the most overrated place in genoa. It is a small fishing village with colourful buildings thatts all. The drinks and coffee was expensive. Go spend your time in portion or camomile.",
          "Giving this a score of \"average\" is probably a little unfair but one couldn't say \"very good\". I caught a bus from the centre of Genova, went for a walk along the promenade and then was the only person apart from a couple of kids who was brave enough to swim in the water.A",
          "Beautiful small beach close to the center of the city . Perfect for a short swim in a hot day (minimal facilities) with a good ice cream to follow",
          "Pretty tiny Italian coastal village. Romantic. If you can walk there from Genoa alone the promenade.",
          "Absolutely surprises to find a place like this around genoa, beautiful colourful houses, restaurants near the water. The brack is small and rocky, if you're alright with that you'll like it. We visited for dinner and it was one of the highlights of our holiday. Very romantic!",
          "This is the tiny beach east of Genoa. Beign very close, it is somewhat hard to find. Especially if you happen to have a car. When google maps tells you to park your car, you better listen. Otherwise you'll end up travelling past it without noticing. And then when you come close",
          "If you have ever been in Cinque Terre, the five amazing villages in Liguria, at the Italian Riviera, you might find Boccadasse a bit disappointing. But if not, Boccadassa is really worthwhile to visit for half a day. The little charming fisherman's village with its pastel",
          "NIce place to visit by the beach. I would recommed to by a fish box in the place nearby and eat it by the sea",
          "Beautiful coast with beaches, restaurants and boats. We had a nice walk on the boulevard with the ever changing view.",
          "This is a very nice quarter of Genoa, where you can also enjoy the beach with the locals. It has plenty of good and not expensive restaurants, great Italian gelateria and spectacular view of the sea and city. The is parking available not far from the beach and you can get right",
          "Beautiful gem in the city. Its a bit smaller than I expected, but great for a lunch outing and a quick visit.",
          "We caught the bus to Boccadasse for 1.50E. Walked down to the beach, sat and had a drink at a bar and enjoyed the view. The fishermen came in around 4pm. On our way out we came across a great little ice creamery, yummo. Walked along the boulevard and enjoyed the view",
          "Back covered by houses and a hill, Boccadasse is next to a small beach, in the middly of the city. just few km from the centre. It was a fishermen area, characterized by its rocky structure. Now it is a place to have a beer, an oice cream or try some restaurants. Recommend to",
          "Absolutely beautiful hidden paradise. Anything possibly you could think of you will find here. It is romantic, fun, clubby and in general all you would want for a day trip. You can relax at cozy small restaurants with amazing view, explore hidden bars and dance after dawn on the",
          "I am from near Boccadasse so my review will be biased. It's a beautiful little fisherman \"village\" (now it's part of the city, but 100 years ago it was considered to be countryside). The place is quite picturesque and is best enjoyed during summer, when people have aperitifs and",
          "It's small but nice. We climbed the rocks, walked a bit on the stone beach, took some pictures, had some expensive ice-cream. After this we took a stroll on the boulevard.",
          "Visited this place in early August. It has some charm with a church, small beach and restaurants. But to be numbered No. 1? This can not be true! There are so many nicer places in Genova, but not place. We spent about 30 minutes to walk around. That was it.",
          "This little inlet is very picturesque and it is definitely worth a visit. We went in the middle of Summer and it was not crowded, which was a nice surprise. We got to it via local train - get off at Stura, head for the sea and it should take you about 15 mins. One thing though",
          "it is a bit annoying to bump into closed gates while roaming in streets. otherwise very nice neighborhood",
          "If you like taking pictures then Boccadasse offers great photo opportunities. Otherwise there is not much to see and it's not worth the 45 minute bus trip from the city center.",
          "The pictures are misleading. Its a tiny, rocky beach at the end of streets that are impossible to navigate. Not worth the effort. (The ice cream store was awesome, though.)",
          "A beautiful small and ancient fishing village at the end of Genova Corso Italia sea drive, with a famous l Ice Cream shop, where on weekends you must queue for at least 10 minutes before getting your order, and typical small trattorie where you can eat good fish. Better to go",
          "A pleasant walk in the evening along the sea front to a pleasant location with a couple of restaurants for some decent food and wine.",
          "This is a mere bus trip from central Genoa but might as well be another country. It is not yet overwhelmed by tourists and therefore still retains the little village feel with a few restaurants bordering a stone beach to the gently lapping water. Grab a caf\u00e9 and plonk yourself",
          "Well worth the bus ride from Genoa, lovely old place to wander around, we stopped for a drink at the little bar/restaurant by the beach. Recommended.",
          "Beautiful little bay in Genova, perfect for a picnic in the evenings or an aperitivo in one of the bars with friends. Though the water's probably not the cleanest for swimming in since it is still very close to the city. Definitely one of the must-see spots of Genova! :)",
          "Don't miss this wonderful corner of peace and relax. Little baja between old and beutiful coloured buildings according the local tradition. Water of the sea is normally calm and peaceful, surrounding by fisher boats.",
          "One of the nicest fishing villages in this part of the country. Ideal for relaxing wandering, enjoying the sea and beautiful surroundings. There are some nice restaurants and bars worth having a meal or just a cup of coffee.",
          "the beach was small and pebbly but in the heat the water was cool and there was a couple of nice places to get refreshments",
          "What a magnificent place The shingle beach is beautiful The houses and alleys so quaint The few bars and restaurants are high quality A must to visit",
          "We walked and wandered and wondered and walked from town, keeping the water on our right. One of the magical aspects of 'travel' is the opportunity to observe how other people live. Today is June 24th: the kids are still in school, the visiting hordes are still at their jobs in",
          "If you have an afternoon to spare when staying in Genoa, this is a really worth the trip. We got a train 2 stops to Genoa Sturla and walked about 15 minutes to get there. The train ticket is actually bought at the bus station outside Genoa Principe. It was picture postcard",
          "Follow the bus path, and you arrive with out much difficulty. Worth the time to visit. Takes awhile to arrive, but sights are well worth the time",
          "Fantastic place, very peaceful, breathtaking views. Walking in the narrow alleys and steep hills give the place a prominently natural feel. Family friendly. Nearby fishermen restaurants are amazing with their home cooked meals-true Italian. Walking we came across a cafe called",

          "it was just perfect. loved it. awesome location ! easy to go with the car there and also easy to find a parking. just like in a movie",
          "A lovely fishing village with excellent seafood restaurants. The view is stunning especially at sunset. Totally different from the rest of Genoa which is a port city!!",
          "We had a quick look at the bus system in Genoa centro, but ended up jumping in a taxi, which took about 20 minutes. Very peaceful and picturesque place to relax. At lunchtime there was only one \"sit down\" restaurant open, but we opted for one of the handful of takeaways",
          "This is a beautiful walk along the Corso Italia on the coastline but, as in the Promenade des Anglais in Nice, I regret that the large road is just nearby making the walk quite noisy sometimes. Some very nice and old buildings (some with a Byzantine architecture) can be spotted",
          "The atmosphere of a fishermen village a few steps from the city, an excellent place to relax and sit by the seaside... excellent ice cream too!",
          "Great spot. It's not the Cinque Terra but well worth the walk. In fact the walk from the city along Corso Italia is simply fantastic on a nice day. It's a must do in Genoa. Great city with many faces. Would come back in a blink.",
          "We enjoyed our visit,sat on the flat rocks and enjoyed the great views and village atmosphere. Afterwards we went for a walk along the esplanade and enjoyed a gelati.",
          "Pretty place, having a coffee while viewing the sea under the sun is a great pleasure. But it is hard to find a taxi for return",
          "It's a small fisherman village, very nice, but always overcrowded.....with less people would be better, anyhow, it's really a small area, but coming from the city it represents the first possibility to see the sea from a nice angle.",
          "Not far from Genoa via bus, great atmosphere, view, restaurants and ice cream. Visit the church if open.",
          "This place is heaven on Earth. Is so beautiful that you can stay there for days and never get bored Just sit and see how sea waves are hiting those colored and beautiful houses. Unique experience",
          "A stroll along the wide Corso Italia promenade with views of the sea brings you to the quaint village of Boccadasse with houses cascading down to a small beach and the sea. A few restaurants line the seafront, which are a little overpriced. However the charming surroundings make",
          "This is one of the best area in the whole city. You can easily reach Boccadasse by bus or by Uber (if you subscribe with the app Uber with code \"uberprovami\" you have a free ride), by taxi or by walk from the near Corso Italia. You can visit Boccadasse in any season, It's",
          "Walked from Genoa on the promenade with wonderful views.Boccadasse is well worth the visit ,carried on walking to Nevi Train Station and taking a train back to Genoa. Buy tickets at the newsagent at the station 1:60 euros.",
          "Whilst a nice spot the beach is tiny and the surrounding area small. It was very busy when we visited hate to think what it would be like in the summer.",
          "We took the bus (I think it was Nr 41 or 42) from Brignole train station - it's about 15 minutes to Boccadasse, which is next to the Corso Italia with all the \"bagni\". I can imagine that it's quite popular in summer, but in mid- to late March Boccadasse is a peaceful place to",
          "Lovely fishing village, an ancient harbour with brightly painted, cramped houses running down the sea. Charming and unpretentious, lively see front cafes, a pleasant stroll along the promenade from the old port of Genoa.",
          "Very pretty, so close to Genoa, but a world away. Not to be missed! A great place to sit by the water or stroll along the walkway with a gelato!",
          "I'm from Genova, and I always used to come here to have an ice cream since I was a kid. This place can give you an idea about how Liguria used to be in ancient times: a chain of small fishermen hamlets wherever there was a shelter for the boats. I can say that in the last 50",
          "A small village in the heart of a big city. It's a jewel! Wonderful restaurants, excellent ice cream parlours, a view to die for!",
          "Very exciting and nice place with very comfortable weather and sightseeing view also good location to take many beautiful photos.",
          "I have to say we were a bit disappointed after the build up some of the guidebooks and postcards gave this place and comparisons to Cinque Terra. We are in the Cinque Terra as I write this and there is hands-down no comparison. That was pretty obvious as soon as we arrived in",
          "You must visit this place to see the most beautiful sunset of Genoa italy. Very nice church nearby. Food joints nearby are very cosy and has nice view.",

          "I would recommend this place to anyone. I found it on the internet by chance before going to Genoa and we decided to visit it. It looks exactly like in the photos. It is so relaxing to stay on a bench and look over the amazing view that is offered. From Genoa is not so difficult",
          "It was the best experience we had from Genoa the evening we spent in this old port. Although not located close to the centre of the town, it is absolutely worth the ride! There is very good selection of restaurants. Also you can find the most delicious ice cream in Genoa for",
          "If you are up for a fairly long walk I would recommend going to Boccadasse. The reception desk in our hotel (in central Genoa) recommended going by taxi but if we had of done, we would have missed seeing so much of Genoa. Being December, the promenade was very quiet but to be",
          "This is one of the most famous views of the town. Originally a small fisherman's town, Boccadasse is nowadays part of the city, but it's easy to feel the old atmosphere. Go for a walk, but don't stop in the main square! After having lunch or dinner in one of the nice restaurants",
          "This old small port of fisherman is a jewel in Genoa. You can reach it at the end of Corso Italia promenade. Genoa people is used to taste a good ice cream on this little beach.",
          "Delightful little village not far from the Centre of Genoa. You can walk there if you like within an hour or so, delightful walk along the promenade, but there is a bus from Genoa. This is not a must but a pleasant addition if you have the time.",
          "I've been to Boccadasse recently for the first time. Its indeed the nicest quite place in Genoa in my opinion. I've been there at dawn to witness the sunrise. I've taken a few photos of the place and for sure, I'm going back there again for more exploration. Must go if you ever",
          "amazing place to have rest. espicially in nights,you can take couple of your friends,a blanket and a bottle of the wine than you are ready to be relax! even you can bring your guitar or whatever you play! there is a little bar in there it is a little expensive,i suggest you",

          "When asking my colleagues where to run, they told me straight away to take Corso Italia to Boccadasse. The large pedestrian-friendly way to Boccadasse was great. Lots of people, bars, and beaches along the way. But the real gem was reaching this buzzing little village. Once you",
          "I am so glad I found the previous reviews on Boccadasse. I wanted a break from the center and took a bus ride (well, actually two!) and went last night. I just loved it. I sat outdoors at one of the restaurants and ordered an aperitivo to soak in the view. Although I had to move",
          "When we went for walk around here it was raining, yet it was a very pleasant place to be. Its character has been maintained and some of the homes have the wow factor. It is also interesting to think of its history and if walls could talk I bet they could tell some tales.",
          "A small \"Portofino\", \"Positano\" a fisherman's village embedded in the city of Genova. Looking at the pics is enough. A real gem.",
          "If you enjoy a walk along the seafront then this is for you, we walked from the center of Genoa along the terracotta path just off the beach, its a long walk about an hour and a half but you can stop along the way and enjoy a coffee or perhaps a spritz. Once there just relax on",
          "It is nice place, known as fishers village. There are many restaurants nearby on sea side o enjoy panoramic view of sea. There is very old church from where you can see water merging to land, pebbles beach. Nice place to eat gelato, very good shop with marking since 1927. From",
          "As the title suggests this place is super cute, with a little pebble beach and a very good gelateria. It's a lovely place to take photos and there is also a short walk to a look out down the coast. Not a lot to do there but is definitely worth a visit. The trip down the Corsa",

          "This is really a worth seeing place in my hometown...characteristic, romantic...few guides will suggest it cuz it is not right in the city centre, but you can get there quite easily (5-10 minutes by car) and admiring a fantastic place. Take the \"creuza\" ( narrow steep street)",
          "As part of our holiday to Genoa, we caught a bus to Boccadesse for a few hours of sun and sea. This is definitely worth doing. If its a hot day, take your swimming stuff and either try the sea or the local lido which is walking distance from Italia 5 or Italia 6 bus stops on",

          "We walked along the promenade all the way from Stazione Principe to Boccadasse which took about 1.5 hours, but it was worth it. When you arrive in Boccadasse it feels a world away from the hustle and bustle of Genoa. It almost has the feeling of a charming Cornish fishermans",
          "We loved Boccadasse and we had dinner at Trattoria da Osvaldo. Fantastic genovese food. Higly recommend it.",
          "A very nice, very famous ice cream store. Also a couple of nice restaurants, right by the water (not very cheap). Good seafood. Characteristic Borgo, very small, it takes 15 minutes to see it all",
          "Lovely town. Our round the city bus trip gave us free local bus travel so we took the bus, walked around and found a lovely pavement cafe by the beach/bay. A very pleasant start to a month in Europe.",

          "At the end of Corso Italia by the Church of Sant\u2019Antonio you will find the brick pathway that leads down to the small fishing village of Boccadasse. If the church is open, it\u2019s worth a stop for its beautiful art work dedicated to people of the sea. Yes, I agree with the other",

          "When people arrives in the end of Corso Italia (starting from the centre of the city) can see the St. Anthony church on the sea. The church itself is quite beautiful. But just there behind there is a steep walkway to reach the small beach below. I suggest to go there to enjoy",
          "Best place in Genova for a romantic date! Incredible view, not to be missed!",
          "Boccadasse is an ancient fishing village, founded around the year 1000. This is a delightful and romantic must-see place, with an amazing view of those ancient homes, of the small beach and of the sea.. but also typical restaurants, bars, an historical gelateria and the Church",
          "this is a really tranquill place that used to be an active finishing village. Now one can walk around and eat amazing icecream and admire the views over the sea"

        "wiki": "Genoa ( JEN-oh-\u0259; Italian: Genova [\u02c8d\u0292\u025b\u02d0nova] (listen); Ligurian: Z\u00eana [\u02c8ze\u02d0na]; English, historically, and Latin: Genua) is the capital of the Italian region of Liguria and the sixth-largest city in Italy. In 2015, 594,733 people lived within the city's administrative limits. As of the 2011 Italian census, the Province of Genoa, which in 2015 became the Metropolitan City of Genoa, counted 855,834 resident persons. Over 1.5 million people live in the wider metropolitan area stretching along the Italian Riviera.Located on the Gulf of Genoa in the Ligurian Sea, Genoa has historically been one of the most important ports on the Mediterranean: it is currently the busiest in Italy and in the Mediterranean Sea and twelfth-busiest in the European Union. Genoa has been nicknamed la Superba (\"the proud one\") due to its glorious past and impressive landmarks. Part of the old town of Genoa was inscribed on the World Heritage List (UNESCO) in 2006 as Genoa: Le Strade Nuove and the system of the Palazzi dei Rolli. The city's rich cultural history in art, music and cuisine allowed it to become the 2004 European Capital of Culture. It is the birthplace of Guglielmo Embriaco, Christopher Columbus, Andrea Doria, Niccol\u00f2 Paganini, Giuseppe Mazzini, Renzo Piano and Grimaldo Canella, founder of the House of Grimaldi, among others.\nGenoa, which forms the southern corner of the Milan-Turin-Genoa industrial triangle of Northwest Italy, is one of the country's major economic centers. The city has hosted massive shipyards and steelworks since the 19th century, and its solid financial sector dates back to the Middle Ages. The Bank of Saint George, founded in 1407, is among the oldest in the world and has played an important role in the city's prosperity since the middle of the 15th century. A number of leading Italian companies are based in the city, including Fincantieri, Selex ES, Ansaldo Energia, Ansaldo STS, Edoardo Raffinerie Garrone, Piaggio Aerospace, Mediterranean Shipping Company and Costa Cruises.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe city's modern name may derive from the Latin word meaning \"knee\" (genu; plural, genua) but there are other theories. It could derive from the god Janus, because Genoa, like him, has two faces: a face that looks at the sea and another turned to the mountains. Or it could come from the Latin word ianua, also related to the name of the God Janus, and meaning \"door\" or \"passage.\" Besides that, it may refer to its geographical position at the centre of the Ligurian coastal arch. The Latin name, oppidum Genua, is recorded by Pliny the Elder (Nat. Hist. 3.48) as part of the Augustean Regio IX Liguria.Another theory traces the name to the Etruscan word Kainua which means \"New City\", based on an inscription on a pottery sherd reading Kainua, suggests that the Latin name may be a corruption of an older Etruscan one with an original meaning of \"new town\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Genoa area has been inhabited since the fifth or fourth millennium BC. In the 5th century BC the first town, or oppidum, was founded at the top of the hill today called Castello (Castle), which is now inside the medieval old town. Among the ancient inhabitants of the region were the Ligures, that gave the name to the modern Liguria. \nGenoa is a port city by birth, establishing itself as the merchant capital of the newly established Republic of Genoa in 1005 and maintaining its independence until 1797. Throughout its existence the Republic had different forms of government, the most notable of these was the Dogate, that in actuality, was an oligarchy ruled by a group of wealthy merchant families, from whom the doges were selected.\nDuring the Late Middle Ages Genoa was one of the main commercial powers of the Mediterranean Sea, while between the 16th and 17th centuries it was one of the major financial centers in Europe.The earliest known state deposit bank, Banco di San Giorgio (Bank of St. George), was founded in 1407 at Genoa.\nThe fleet's participation in the Crusades allowed Genoa to further establish prosperous trading colonies, in fact, throughout its history, the Republic extended its direct domain in numerous territories, including Corsica, Cyprus, Tabarka, Chios and Southern Crimea.Thereafter, Genovese bankers, financed many of the Spanish crown's foreign endeavors. Fernand Braudel has even called the period 1557 to 1627 the \"age of the Genovese\", \"of a rule that was so discreet and sophisticated that historians for a long time failed to notice it\".However, since the 16th century, Genoa began to lose almost all of its colonies across the Mediterranean, and the influence of the once powerful republic began to decline.It was 1796 that the Republic of Genoa finally ended, replaced by Napoleonic ruled Ligurian Republic. Since 1815 after the \"Congresso di Vienna\" Genoa was annexed to the Regno di Sardegna (Sardinia Kingdom). Italian unification of 1861 resulted in Genoa becoming the maritime hub of the new Italian state.\n\n\n=== Flag ===\n\nThe flag of Genoa is a St. George's Cross, a red cross on a white field.\nThe patron saint of Genoa was Saint Lawrence until at least 958, but the Genoese transferred their allegiance to Saint George (and Saint John the Baptist) at some point during the 11th or 12th century, most likely with the rising popularity of the military saint during the Crusades. Genoa also had a banner displaying a cross since at latest 1218, possibly as early as 1113. But the cross banner was not associated with the saint; indeed, the saint had his own flag, the vexillum beati Georgii (first mentioned 1198), a red flag showing George and the dragon. A depiction of this flag is shown in the Genoese annals under the year 1227. The Genoese flag with the red cross was used alongside this \"Saint George's flag\", from at least 1218, known as the insignia cruxata comunis Janue (\"cross ensign of the commune of Genoa\"). \nThe saint's flag was the city's main war flag, but the cross flag was used alongside it in the 1240s.The Saint George's flag (i.e. the flag depicting the saint) remained the main flag of Genoa at least until the 1280s. The flag now known as the \"St. George's Cross\" seems to have replaced it as Genoa's main flag at some point during the 14th century. The Book of Knowledge of All Kingdoms (c. 1385) shows it, inscribed with the word iusti\u00e7ia, and described as:\n\nAnd the lord of this place has as his ensign a white pennant with a red cross. At the top it is inscribed with 'justice', in this manner.\nWhile it has been claimed by some that the flag of England was adopted from the Genoan flag during the First Crusade in 1190, historians conclusively have pointed to a lack of evidence of the Genoan flag had any relationship to the English one.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe city of Genoa covers an area of 243 square kilometres (94 sq mi) between the Ligurian Sea and the Apennine Mountains. The city stretches along the coast for about 30 kilometres (19 mi) from the neighbourhood of Voltri to Nervi, and for 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from the coast to the north along the valleys Polcevera and Bisagno. The territory of Genoa is popularly divided into 5 main zones: the centre, the west, the east, the Polcevera and the Bisagno Valley.\nGenoa is adjacent to two popular Ligurian vacation spots: Camogli and Portofino. In the metropolitan area of Genoa lies Aveto Natural Regional Park.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nGenoa has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, since only one summer month has less than 40 millimetres (1.57 in) of rainfall, preventing it from being classified as solely oceanic or Mediterranean, with a special note for the Genoa low.\nThe average yearly temperature is around 19 \u00b0C (66 \u00b0F) during the day and 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) at night. In the coldest months: December, January and February, the average temperature is 12 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F) during the day and 6 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F) at night. In the warmest months \u2013 July and August \u2013 the average temperature is 27.5 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F) during the day and 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F) at night. The daily temperature range is limited, with an average range of about 6 \u00b0C (11 \u00b0F) between high and low temperatures. Genoa also sees significant moderation from the sea, in stark contrast to areas behind the Ligurian mountains such as Parma, where summers are hotter and winters are quite cold.\nAnnually, the average 2.9 of nights recorded temperatures of \u22640 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) (mainly in January). The coldest temperature ever recorded was \u22128 \u00b0C (18 \u00b0F) on the night of February 2012; the highest temperature ever recorded during the day is 38.5 \u00b0C (101 \u00b0F) on the August 2015. Average annual number of days with temperatures of \u226530 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) is about 8, average four days in July and August.Average annual temperature of the sea is 17.5 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), from 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) in the period January\u2013March to 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) in August. In the period from June to October, the average sea temperature exceeds 19 \u00b0C (66 \u00b0F).Genoa is also a windy city, especially during winter when northern winds often bring cool air from the Po Valley (usually accompanied by lower temperatures, high pressure and clear skies). Another typical wind blows from southeast, mostly as a consequence of Atlantic disturbances and storms, bringing humid and warmer air from the sea. Snowfall is sporadic, but does occur almost every year, albeit big amounts in the city centre are rare.Annual average relative humidity is 68%, ranging from 63% in February to 73% in May.Sunshine hours total above 2,200 per year, from an average 4 hours of sunshine duration per day in winter to average 9 hours in summer. This value is an average between the northern half of Europe and North Africa.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Municipal government ===\nThe Municipal Council of Genoa is currently led by a right-wing majority, elected in June 2017. The mayor is Marco Bucci, expression of a right-wing alliance composed by Forza Italia, Lega Nord, Fratelli d'Italia and other minor lists. Genoa was traditionally considered a leftist city and Bucci is the first right-wing mayor since 1975.\n\n\n==== Administrative subdivision ====\nThe city of Genoa is subdivided into nine municipi (administrative districts), as approved by the Municipal Council in 2007.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Main sights ===\n\nNotable to the city are the Palazzi dei Rolli, included in UNESCO World Heritage Site Genoa: Le Strade Nuove and the system of the Palazzi dei Rolli. The world-famous Strade Nuove are via Garibaldi (Strada Nuova), via Cairoli (Strada Nuovissima) and via Balbi (Strada Balbi). Among the most important palaces are the Palazzo Rosso, Palazzo Bianco, Palazzo Podest\u00e0 o di Nicolosio Lomellino, Palazzo Reale, Palazzo Angelo Giovanni Spinola, Palazzo Pietro Spinola di San Luca and Palazzo Spinola di Pellicceria.\nGenoa's historic centre is articulated in a maze of squares and narrow caruggi (typical Genoese alleys). It joins a medieval dimension with following 16th century and Baroque interventions (the ancient Via Aurea, now Via Garibaldi).\nNear Via Garibaldi, through the public elevator Castelletto Levante, one can reach one of the most scenic places in the city, Belvedere Castelletto. The centre of Genoa is connected to its upper part by ancient paths caught between tall palaces, called creuze. Walking along these small paths one can reach magnificent places like the Santuario di Nostra Signora di Loreto. Very beautiful is the upper ring road so-called Circonvallazione a Monte that includes Corso Firenze, Corso Paganini, Corso Magenta, Via Solferino, and Corso Armellini.\nSan Lorenzo cathedral has a splendid portal and the dome designed by Galeazzo Alessi. Inside is found the treasure of the Cathedral where among other objects there is also what is said to be the Holy Chalice.\nThe symbols of the city are the Lanterna (the lighthouse) (117 metres (384 feet) high), old and standing lighthouse visible in the distance from the sea (beyond 30 kilometres (19 miles)), and the monumental fountain of Piazza De Ferrari, recently restored, out-and-out core of the city's life. Near Piazza De Ferrari and Teatro Carlo Felice is the Mazzini Gallery, a typical nineteenth-century structure with many elegant shops and coffee bars.\nAnother tourist destination is the ancient seaside district of Boccadasse (which means \"the mouth of the donkey\"), with its multicolour boats, set as a seal to Corso Italia, the promenade which runs along the Lido d'Albaro, and known for its ice-creams. After Boccadasse you can continue along the sea up to Sturla.\n\nJust out of the city centre, but still part of the 33 km (21 mi) of coast included in the municipality's territory, are Nervi, natural doorway to the Ligurian East Riviera, and Pegli, the point of access to the West Riviera. Nervi offers many attractions: the promenade overlooking the sea called Passeggiata Anita Garibaldi; parks covered with lush tropical vegetation; numerous villas and palaces open to the public that now house museums (like GAM-Galleria d'Arte Moderna, Raccolte Frugone Museum, Museo Giannettino Luxoro and Wolfsoniana). (see also Parchi di Nervi) The East Riviera of Genoa called Riviera di Levante is part of the Italian Riviera. East Riviera is full of interesting towns to visit, and then from Genoa to east are: Bogliasco, Pieve Ligure, Sori, Recco, Camogli, Portofino, Santa Margherita Ligure, Rapallo, Zoagli, Chiavari, Lavagna and Sestri Levante. In the west, Pegli is the site of the famous Villa Durazzo-Pallavicini and Arenzano is a seaside town at the foot of the Parco naturale regionale del Beigua.\nThe new Genoa based its rebirth upon the restoration of the green areas of the immediate inland parts, among them the Parco naturale regionale del Beigua, and upon the construction of facilities such as the Aquarium of Genoa in the Old Harbour - the biggest in Italy and one of the major in Europe - and its Marina (the tourist small port which holds hundreds of pleasure boats). All of these are inside the restored Expo Area, arranged in occasion of the Columbian Celebrations of 1992.\nNear the city are Camogli and San Fruttuoso abbey accessible by a daily ferry from the Old Harbour (Porto Antico) of Genoa. In the seabed in front of the San Fruttuoso abbey there is the Christ of the Abyss. From the Old Harbour one can reach by boat other famous seaside places around Genoa such as Portofino or a little more distant, Lerici and the Cinque Terre.\nThe regained pride gave back to the city the consciousness of being capable of looking to the future without forgetting its past. The resumption of several flourishing hand-crafting activities, far-back absent from the caruggi of the old town, is a direct evidence of it. The restoration of many of Genoa's churches and palaces in the 1980s and the 1990s contributed to the city's rebirth. A notable example the Renaissance, Basilica of Santa Maria Assunta, sitting on the top of the hill of Carignano and visible from almost every part of the city. The total restoration of Doge's Palace and of the Old Harbour, and the rebuilding of Teatro Carlo Felice, destroyed by bombing in the Second World War, were two more points of strength for the realisation of a new Genoa.\nGenoa could not renounce, especially as from the 1960s, to a great renewal, which as happened in several other metropolis, should necessarily get through the realisation of big public housing complexes, whose quality, utility and functionality has been and still is controversial for those residents living there. Concerning this, the most known cases are those of the so-called \"Biscione\", a development in the shape of a long snake, situated on the hills of the populous district of Marassi, and the one of the group of houses known as \"Le Lavatrici\" (the washing machines), in the district of Pr\u00e0.\nBeyond a complete restyling of the area, the ancient port zone nearby the Mandraccio opening, in Porta Siberia, was enriched by Genoese architect Renzo Piano with a large sphere made of metal and glass, installed in the port's waters, not far from the Aquarium of Genoa, and unveiled in 2001 in occasion of the G8 Summit held in Genoa. The sphere (called by the citizens \"Piano's bubble\" or \"The Ball\"), after hosting an exposition of fens from Genoa's Botanical Gardens, currently houses the reconstruction of a tropical environment, with several plants, little animals and butterflies.\nPiano also designed the subway stations and, in the hills area, the construction - in collaboration with UNESCO - of Punta Nave, base of the Renzo Piano Building Workshop.\nNearby the Old Harbour is the so-called \"Matitone\", a skyscraper in shape of a pencil, that lays side by side with the group of the WTC towers, core of the San Benigno development, today base of part of the Municipality's administration and of several companies.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nSt. Lawrence Cathedral (Cattedrale di San Lorenzo) is the city's cathedral, built in a Gothic-Romanesque style. Other notable historical churches are the Commandery of the Saint John's Order called Commenda di San Giovanni di Pr\u00e8l, San Matteo, San Donato, Santa Maria di Castello, Sant'Agostino (deconsecrated since the 19th century, sometimes is used for theatrical representations), Santo Stefano, Santi Vittore e Carlo, Basilica della Santissima Annunziata del Vastato, San Pietro in Banchi, Santa Maria delle Vigne, Nostra Signora della Consolazione, San Siro, Santa Maria Maddalena, Santa Maria Assunta di Carignano and Chiesa del Ges\u00f9. San Bartolomeo degli Armeni houses the Image of Edessa and San Pancrazio after the World War II was entrusted to the ligurian delegation of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. These churches and basilicas are built in Romanesque (San Donato, Santa Maria di Castello, Commenda di San Giovanni di Pr\u00e9), Gothic (San Matteo, Santo Stefano, Sant'Agostino), Baroque (San Siro) or Renaissance (Santa Maria Assunta di Carignano, San Pietro in Banchi) appearance, or a mix of different styles (Nostra Signora della Consolazione, Santissima Annunziata del Vastato; this last has a Baroque interior and a Neoclassicist fa\u00e7ade).\n\nAnother well known Genoese church is the shrine of Saint Francis of Paola, notable for the outer courtyard overlooking the port and the memorial to all those who died at sea. This church is of artistic mention in that the tile depictions of the Via Crucis Stations along the brick path to the church.\nNear Genoa is found the Shrine of Nostra Signora della Guardia, (the sanctuary is said to have inspired the writer Umberto Eco in making his novel The Name of the Rose). Another interesting church in the neighborhoods of Genoa is San Siro di Struppa.\nThe city was the birthplace of several popes (Innocent IV, Adrian V, Innocent VIII, and Benedict XV) and various saints (Syrus of Genoa, Romulus of Genoa, Catherine of Genoa, and Virginia Centurione Bracelli). The Archbishop of Genoa Jacobus de Varagine wrote the Golden Legend. Also from Genoa were: Giovanni Paolo Oliva, the Superior General of the Society of Jesus; Girolamo Grimaldi-Cavalleroni, the Archbishop of Aix; Ausonio Franchi, priest, philosopher, and theologian; Cardinal Giuseppe Siri; and the priests Francesco Repetto, Giuseppe Dossetti, Gianni Baget Bozzo, and Andrea Gallo. The present archbishop of Genoa, Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, comes from a Genoese family but was born in Pontevico, near Brescia (see also Archdiocese of Genoa).\n\n\n=== Buildings and palaces ===\n\nThe main features of central Genoa include the Piazza De Ferrari, around which are the Opera and the Palace of the Doges.\nThe Palazzo di San Giorgio was the headquarters of the Bank of Saint George and was the place where Marco Polo and Rustichello da Pisa composed The Travels of Marco Polo.\nOutside the city walls is Christopher Columbus House, where Christopher Columbus is said to have lived as a child. The current building is an 18th-century reconstruction of the original which was destroyed by the French naval bombing of 1684.\n\nStrada Nuova (now Via Garibaldi), in the old city, was inscribed on the World Heritage List in 2006. This district was designed in the mid-16th century to accommodate Mannerist palaces of the city's most eminent families. In Genoa there are 114 noble palaces (see also Rolli di Genova): among these 42 are inscribed on the World Heritage List. Among the Palazzi dei Rolli the most famous are Palazzo Rosso (now a museum), Palazzo Bianco, Palazzo Tursi, Palazzo Gerolamo Grimaldi, Palazzo Podest\u00e0, Palazzo Reale, Palazzo Angelo Giovanni Spinola, Palazzo Pietro Spinola di San Luca, Palazzo Spinola di Pellicceria, Palazzo Cicala. Palazzo Bianco and Palazzo Rosso are also known as Musei di Strada Nuova. The famous art college is also located on this street. The Genoese artistic renaissance begins with the construction of Villa del Principe commissioned by Andrea Doria: the architects were Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli and Giovanni Ponzello, the interior was painted by Perino del Vaga and the garden fountain was realised by Taddeo Carlone. In 1548 Galeazzo Alessi, with the project of Villa Giustiniani-Cambiaso, designed a new prototype of Genoese palace that would be an inspiration to other architects working in Genoa as Bartolomeo Bianco, Pietro Antonio Corradi, Rocco Lurago, Giovan Battista Castello, and Bernardino Cantone. Peter Paul Rubens wrote Palazzi di Genova in 1622, a book dedicated to the palaces of Genoa.\nScattered around the city are many villas, built between the fifteenth and the twentieth centuries. Among the best known are: Villa Brignole Sale Duchessa di Galliera, Villa Durazzo-Pallavicini, Villa Doria Centurione, Villa Durazzo Bombrini, Villa Serra, Villa Giustiniani-Cambiaso, Villa Rossi Martini, Villa Imperiale Scassi, Villa Grimaldi, Villa Negrone Moro, Villa Rosazza, Villetta Di Negro, Villa delle Peschiere, Villa Imperiale, Villa Saluzzo Bombrini, and Villa Grimaldi Fassio.\n\nAs it regards the 19th century remember the architects Ignazio Gardella (senior), and Carlo Barabino which among other things, realises together with Giovanni Battista Resasco, the Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno. The cemetery is renowned for its statues and sepulchral monuments that preserve the mortal remains of notable personalities, including Giuseppe Mazzini, Fabrizio De Andr\u00e9, and Constance Lloyd (Oscar Wilde's wife). In the first half of the 19th century they are completed the Albergo dei Poveri and the Acquedotto storico. In 1901 Giovanni Antonio Porcheddu realised the Silos Granari.\n\nThe city is rich in testimony of the Gothic Revival like Albertis Castle, Castello Bruzzo, Villa Canali Gaslini and Mackenzie Castle designed by the architect Gino Copped\u00e8. Genoa is also rich of Art Nouveau works, among which: Palazzo della Borsa, Via XX Settembre, Hotel Bristol Palace, Grand Hotel Miramare and Stazione marittima. Works of Rationalist architecture of the first half of the 20th century are Torre Piacentini and Piazza della Vittoria where Arco della Vittoria, both designed by the architect Marcello Piacentini. Other architects who have changed the face of Genoa in the 20th century are: Ignazio Gardella, Luigi Carlo Daneri who realised the Piazza Rossetti and the residential complex so-called Il Biscione, Mario Lab\u00f2, Aldo Rossi, Ludovico Quaroni, Franco Albini who designed the interiors of Palazzo Rosso, and Piero Gambacciani. The Edoardo Chiossone Museum of Oriental Art, designed by Mario Lab\u00f2, has one of the largest collections of Oriental art in Europe.\nOther notable architectural works include: the Old Harbour's new design with the Aquarium, the Bigo and the Biosfera by Renzo Piano, the Palasport di Genova, the Matitone skyscraper, and the Padiglione B of Genoa Fair, by Jean Nouvel. Genoa was home to the Ponte Morandi by Riccardo Morandi, built in 1967, collapsed in 2018 and demolished February-June, 2019.\n\n\n=== Old harbour ===\n\nThe old harbour (\"porto antico\" in Italian) is the ancient part of the port of Genoa. The harbour gave access to outside communities creating a good geographical situation for the city. The city is spread out geographically along a section of the Liguria coast, which makes trading by ship possible. Before the development of car, train, and airplane travel, the main outside access for the city was the sea, as the surrounding mountains made trade north by land more difficult than coastal trade. Trade routes have always connected Genoa on an international scale, with increasingly farther reach starting from trade along Europe's coastline before the medieval period to today's connection across continents. In its heyday the Genoese Navy was a prominent power in the Mediterranean.\nAs the Genoa harbour was so important to the merchants for their own economic success, other nearby harbours and ports were seen as competition for a landing point for foreign traders.  In the 16th century, the Genovese worked to destroy the local shipping competition, the Savona harbour.  Taking matters into their own hands, the Genoa merchants and the politically powerful in Genoa attacked the harbour of Savona with stones. This action was taken to preserve the economic stability and wealth of the city during the rise in prominence of Savona. The Genovese would go as far as to war with other coastal, trading cities such as Venice, in order to protect the trade industry.\nRenzo Piano redeveloped the area for public access, restoring the historical buildings (like the Cotton warehouses) and creating new landmarks like the Aquarium, the Bigo and recently the \"Bolla\" (the Sphere). The main touristic attractions of this area are the famous Aquarium and the Museum of the Sea (MuMA). In 2007 these attracted almost 1.7 million visitors.\n\n\n=== Walls and fortresses ===\n\nThe city of Genoa during its long history at least since the 9th century had been protected by different line of defensive walls. Large portions of these walls remain today, and Genoa has more and longer walls than any other city in Italy. The main city walls are known as \"Ninth century walls\", \"Barbarossa Walls\" (12th century), \"Fourteenth century walls\", \"Sixteenth century walls\" and \"New Walls\" (\"Mura Nuove\" in Italian). The more imposing walls, built in the first half of the 17th century on the ridge of hills around the city, have a length of almost 20 km (12 mi). Some fortresses stand along the perimeter of the \"New Walls\" or close them.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\n\nGenoa has 82,000 square metres (880,000 square feet) of public parks in the city centre, such as Villetta Di Negro which is right in the heart of the town, overlooking the historical centre. Many bigger green spaces are situated outside the centre: in the east are the Parks of Nervi (96,000 square metres or 1,030,000 square feet) overlooking the sea, in the west the beautiful gardens of Villa Durazzo Pallavicini and its Giardino botanico Clelia Durazzo Grimaldi. (265,000 square metres or 2,850,000 square feet). The numerous villas and palaces of the city also have their own gardens, like Palazzo del Principe, Villa Doria, Palazzo Bianco and Palazzo Tursi, Palazzo Nicolosio Lomellino, Albertis Castle, Villa Rosazza, Villa Croce, Villa Imperiale Cattaneo, Villa Bombrini, Villa Brignole Sale Duchessa di Galliera, Villa Serra and many more.The city is surrounded by natural parks such as Parco naturale regionale dell'Antola, Parco naturale regionale del Beigua, Aveto Natural Regional Park and the Ligurian Sea Cetacean Sanctuary.\n\n\n=== Aquarium of Genoa ===\n\nThe Aquarium of Genoa (in Italian: Acquario di Genova) is the largest aquarium in Italy and among the largest in Europe. Built for Genoa Expo '92, it is an educational, scientific and cultural centre. Its mission is to educate and raise public awareness as regards conservation, management and responsible use of aquatic environments. It welcomes over 1.2 million visitors a year.\nControl of the entire environment, including the temperature, filtration and lighting of the tanks was provided by local Automation Supplier Orsi Automazione, acquired in 2001 by Siemens.\nThe Aquarium of Genoa is co-ordinating the AquaRing EU project. It also provides scientific expertise and a great deal of content for AquaRing, including documents, images, academic content and interactive online courses, via its Online Resource Centre.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAt the beginning of 2011, there were 608,493 people residing in Genoa, of whom 47% were male and 53% were female. The city is characterised by rapid aging and a long history of demographic decline, that has shown a partial slowdown in the last decade. Genoa has the lowest birth rate and is the most aged of any large Italian city. Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled only 14.12% of the population compared to pensioners who number 26.67%. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06% (minors) and 19.94% (pensioners). The median age of Genoa's residents is 47, compared to the Italian average of 42. The current birth rate of the city is only 7.49 births per 1,000 inhabitants, compared to the national average of 9.45. As of 2006, 94.23% of the population was Italian. The largest immigrant group is from the Americas (mostly Ecuador): 2.76%, other European nations (mostly Albania, Ukraine, the former Yugoslavia and Romania): 1.37%, and North Africa: 0.62%. The city is predominantly Roman Catholic, with small numbers of Protestants.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Genoa metropolitan area had a GDP amounting to $30.1 billion in 2011, or $33,003 per capita.\n\nLigurian agriculture has increased its specialisation pattern in high-quality products (flowers, wine, olive oil) and has thus managed to maintain the gross value-added per worker at a level much higher than the national average (the difference was about 42% in 1999). The value of flower production represents over 75% of the agriculture sector turnover, followed by animal farming (11.2%) and vegetable growing (6.4%).\nSteel, once a major industry during the booming 1950s and 1960s, phased out after the late 1980s crisis, as Italy moved away from the heavy industry to pursue more technologically advanced and less polluting productions. So the Ligurian industry has turned towards a widely diversified range of high-quality and high-tech products (food, shipbuilding (in Sestri Ponente and in metropolitan area - Sestri Levante), electrical engineering and electronics, petrochemicals, aerospace etc.). Nonetheless, the regions still maintains a flourishing shipbuilding sector (yacht construction and maintenance, cruise liner building, military shipyards).\nIn the services sector, the gross value-added per worker in Liguria is 4% above the national average. This is due to the increasing diffusion of modern technologies, particularly in commerce and tourism.\nA good motorway network (376 km (234 mi) in 2000) makes communications with the border regions relatively easy. The main motorway is located along the coastline, connecting the main ports of Nice (in France), Savona, Genoa and La Spezia. The number of passenger cars per 1000 inhabitants (524 in 2001) is below the national average (584).\nOn average, about 17 million tonnes of cargo are shipped from the main ports of the region and about 57 million tonnes enter the region. The Port of Genoa, with a trade volume of 58.6 million tonnes ranks first in Italy, second in terms of twenty-foot equivalent units after the transshipment port of Gioia Tauro, with a trade volume of over 2 million TEUs.  The main destinations for the cargo-passenger traffic are Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Barcelona, and the Canary Islands.\nSome companies based in Genoa include Ansaldo STS, Ansaldo Energia, Edoardo Raffinerie Garrone, Piaggio Aerospace, Registro Italiano Navale, Banca Carige, SLAM, and Costa Cruises.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe first organised forms of higher education in Genoa date back to the 13th century when private colleges were entitled to award degrees in Medicine, Philosophy, Theology, Law, Arts.\nToday the University of Genoa, founded in the 15th century, is one of the largest in Italy, with 11 faculties, 51 departments and 14 libraries. In 2007\u20132008, the University had 41,000 students and 6,540 graduates.Genoa is also home to other Colleges, Academies or Museums:\n\nThe Italian Institute of Technology was established in 2003 jointly by the Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research and the Italian Minister of Economy and Finance, to promote excellence in basic and applied research. The main fields of research of the Institute are Neuroscience, Robotics, Nanotechnology, Drug discovery. The central research labs and headquarters are located in Morego, in the neighbourhood of Bolzaneto.Clemson University, based in South Carolina, United States has a villa in Genoa where architecture students and students in related fields can attend for a semester or year-long study program.\nFlorida International University (FIU), based in Miami, Florida, United States also has a small campus in Genoa, with the University of Genoa, which offers classes within the FIU School of Architecture.\n\n\n=== Science ===\n\nGenoa is the birthplace of Giovanni Battista Baliani and Vincentio Reinieri, of the geneticist Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, of the Nobel Prize astrophysicist  Riccardo Giacconi and of the astronaut Franco Malerba. The city is home to the Erzelli Hi-Tech Park, to the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, to the Istituto idrografico della Marina and annually hosts the Festival della Scienza. The city has an important tradition in the fields of the geology, paleontology, botany and naturalistic studies, among the most eminent personalities remember: Lorenzo Pareto, Luigi d'Albertis, Enrico Alberto d'Albertis, Giacomo Doria and Arturo Issel, we point the Orto Botanico dell'Universit\u00e0 di Genova. Very important and renowned is the Istituto Giannina Gaslini.\nIn 1846 the city hosted the eighth Meeting of Italian Scientists and in 1902 Luigi Carnera discovered an asteroid and called it \"485 Genua\", dedicating it to the Latin name of Genoa.\n\n\n==== Erzelli science technology park ====\n\nThe western area of Genoa hosts the Erzelli GREAT Campus, an under construction science technology park which houses the high-tech corporations Siemens, Ericsson, Esaote, and robotics laboratories of the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT).\nThe Erzelli GREAT Campus science park is undergoing a process of enlargement, and in the future will host the new Faculty of Engineering of University of Genoa. The project has been struggling in recent years with enterprises laying off their employees and no real growth.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Ports ===\n\nSeveral cruise and ferry lines serve the passenger terminals in the old port, with a traffic of 3.2 million passengers in 2007. MSC Cruises chose Genoa as one of its main home ports, in competition with the Genoese company Costa Cruises, which moved its home port to Savona. The quays of the passenger terminals extend over an area of 250,000 square metres (2,700,000 square feet), with 5 equipped berths for cruise vessels and 13 for ferries, for an annual capacity of 4 million ferry passengers, 1.5 million cars and 250,000 trucks. The historical maritime station of Ponte dei Mille is today a technologically advanced cruise terminal, with facilities designed after the world's most modern airports, to ensure fast embarking and disembarking of latest generation ships carrying thousand passengers. A third cruise terminal is currently under construction in the redesigned area of Ponte Parodi, once a quay used for grain traffic.\nThe Costa Concordia cruise ship, owned by Costa Cruises, was docked at the port before being dismantled.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\n\nThe Airport of Genoa (IATA: GOA, ICAO: LIMJ) is built on an artificial peninsula, 4 NM (7.4 km; 4.6 mi) west of the city. The airport is currently operated by Aeroporto di Genova S.P.A., which has recently upgraded the airport complex, that now connects Genoa with several daily flights to Rome, Naples, Paris, London, Madrid and Munich. In 2008, 1,202,168 passengers travelled through the airport, with an increase of international destinations and charter flights.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nThe main railway stations are Genoa Brignole in the east and Genoa Principe in the west. Genoa Brignole is close to the business districts and the exhibition centre, while the Principe is close to the port, the university and the historical centre. From these two stations depart the main trains connecting Genoa to France, Turin, Milan and Rome.\nGenoa's third most important station is Genoa Sampierdarena, which serves the densely populated neighbourhood of Sampierdarena. 23 other local stations serve the other neighbourhoods on the 30-kilometre-long coast line from Nervi to Voltri and on the northern line through Bolzaneto and the Polcevera Valley.\nThe municipal administration of Genoa plans to transform these urban railway lines to be part of the rapid transit system, which now consists of the Metropolitana di Genova (Genoa Metro),  a light metro connecting Brin to the city centre. The metro line was extended to Brignole Station in December 2012. Trains currently pass through Corvetto station between De Ferrari and Brignole without stopping. A possible further extension towards the eastern, densely populated boroughs was planned, but the municipal administration intends to improve the public transport by investing in new tram lines instead of completing the extension of the light metro. The current stations of the metro line are Brin-Certosa, Dinegro, Principe, Darsena, San Giorgio, Sant'Agostino and De Ferrari, and the line is 5.3 km (3.3 mi) long.\nThe city's hilly nature has influenced its public transport. The city is served by two funicular railways (the Zecca\u2013Righi funicular, the Sant'Anna funicular), the Quezzi inclined elevator, the Principe\u2013Granarolo rack railway, and ten public lifts.The city's metro, bus and trolleybus network is operated by AMT (Azienda Mobilit\u00e0 e Trasporti S.p.A.). The Drin Bus is a demand responsive transport service that connects the hilly, low-density areas of Genoa.\nThe average time people spend commuting on public transit in Genova, for example to and from work, is 54 min on a weekday. 10% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 12 min, while 13% of riders wait over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4 km, while 2% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Visual arts ===\n\nGenoese painters active in the 14th century include Barnaba da Modena and his local followers Nicol\u00f2 da Voltri and at the same time, the sculptor Giovanni Pisano reached Genoa to make the monument for Margaret of Brabant, whose remains are today housed in the Museum of Sant'Agostino.\nIn the 16th century along with the flourishing trade between the Republic of Genoa and Flanders also grew the cultural exchanges. The painters Lucas and Cornelis de Wael lived in Genoa for a long time, where they played the role of a magnet for many Flemish painters like Jaan Roos, Giacomo Legi, Jan Matsys, Andries van Eertvelt and Vincent Malo.\nThis creative environment also attracted the two most important Flemish painters, Rubens and Van Dyck, who along with Bernardo Strozzi. gave life to the Genoese Painting School of the 17th century.\nMuch of the city's art is found in its churches and palaces, where there are numerous Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo frescos. They are rich in works of art the Cathedral, the Chiesa del Ges\u00f9 where The Circumcision and the \"Miracles of St. Ignatius\" by Rubens, the Assunzione della Vergine by Guido Reni. The Church of San Donato contains works of Barnaba da Modena, Nicol\u00f2 da Voltri and Joos van Cleve, the Church of Santo Stefano The Stoning of St. Stephen by Giulio Romano and the Church of Santa Maria Assunta the sculptures by Filippo Parodi and Pierre Puget, very interesting is the Santa Maria di Castello.

Simonetta Vespucci, considered the most beautiful woman of her time, was also born in Genoa. She is portrayed in The Birth of Venus and Primavera by Sandro Botticelli and in Portrait of Simonetta Vespucci by Piero di Cosimo.\nGenoa is also famous for its numerous tapestries, which decorated the city's many salons. Whilst the patrician palaces and villas in the city were and still are austere and majestic, the interiors tended to be luxurious and elaborate, often full of tapestries, many of which were Flemish. Famous is the Genoese lace called with its name of Turkish origin macram\u00e8. Very used in Genoa is the cobblestone called Risseu and a kind of azulejo called laggioni.\nGenoa has been likened by many to a Mediterranean New York, perhaps for its high houses that in the Middle Ages were the equivalent of today's skyscrapers, perhaps for the sea route Genoa-New York which in past centuries has been travelled by millions of emigrants. The architect Renzo Picasso in his visionary designs reinforces this strange affinity between the two cities.\nIn the Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno, you can admire some magnificent sculpture of the 19th century and early 20th century like Monteverde Angel by Giulio Monteverde, or works by artists such as Augusto Rivalta, Leonardo Bistolfi, Edoardo Alfieri, Santo Varni.\nAmongst the most notable Genoese painters of the 19th century and of the first half of the 20th century are Tammar Luxoro, Ernesto Rayper, Rubaldo Merello, and Antonio Giuseppe Santagata.

We have also remember the dialet poet Edoardo Firpo, the dialect \"poeta crepuscolare\" Giambattista Vigo,  and the symbolist Ceccardo Roccatagliata Ceccardi. The city of Genoa has been an inspiration to many writers and poets among which: Dino Campana, Camillo Sbarbaro, Gaspare Invrea who wrote \"The mouth of the wolf\" and Giorgio Caproni.

        "wiki": "Via Balbi is a street in the historical centre of Genoa, in Northwestern Italy, named after the aristocratic Genoese Balbi family. It is one of the Strade Nuove (Italian for \"new streets\") built by the Genoese aristocracy during the Renaissance. Since July 2006 it is inscribed in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Site Genoa: the Strade Nuove and the system of the Palazzi dei Rolli. \n\n\n== History ==\nFormerly known as Strada Balbi, the street was built between 1602 and 1620 as a cooperation between the city authorities and the Balbi family to improve the connection between the city center and the area around the harbor. \nBetween the first half of the 16th century and the first half of the 17th century, the nobility of the Republic of Genoa started a careful town planning to transform the existing medieval city and initiate a sizeable urban expansion to the North. The move to expand the antique palaces and to build new sumptuous ones was driven by the extraordinary wealth that came into the city through prosperous financing activities towards several European powers. In particular, the Genoese aristocracy financed the expensive undertakings of the Spanish Crown, such as the mercenary army that Spain kept in Flanders from 1566 to the peace of Westphalia in 1648. The ruling class of Genoa, mixing nobility of blood with new mercantile wealth, sought to underpin their prestige by the construction of grand city palaces and suburban villas of unusual splendor. \nThe first stretch of the street includes seven palaces, all formerly owned by the Balbi family, the former Collegium of the Jesuits (now the main seat of the University of Genoa) with the church of San Girolamo e Francesco Saverio and the Carmelite church of San Vittore e Carlo. The final stretch, which used to count eight 17th century monasteries, was modified in the 19th century, when the nearby train station of Genova Principe was built. \n\n\n== Palaces listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site ==\n\n\n== Quotes ==\nStendhal, describes via Balbi and Le Strade Nuove as the most beautiful in ItalyTaking a letter to Mrs Mojon, in Strada Balbi; this is one of the three names of one long street, which is also the most beautiful in Italy\nCharles Dickens gave a suggestive description of Strada Balbi in his travelogue Pictures from Italy....When shall I forget the Streets of Palaces: the Strada Nuova and the Strada Balbi!\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGiorgio Doria (1995), Nobilt\u00e0 e investimenti a Genova in Et\u00e0 moderna, Genova\nGioconda Pomella (2007), Guida Completa ai Palazzi dei Rolli Genova, Genova, De Ferrari Editore(ISBN 9788871728155)\nMauro Quercioli (2008), I Palazzi dei Rolli di Genova, Roma, Libreria dello Stato (ISBN 9788824011433)\nFiorella Caraceni Poleggi (2001), Palazzi Antichi e Moderni di Genova raccolti e disegnati da Pietro Paolo Rubens (1652), Genova, Tormena Editore (ISBN 9788884801302)\nMario Lab\u00f2 (2003), I palazzi di Genova di P.P.

After he converted to Christianity, the Apostles appointed him to be a deacon serving Jerusalem\u2019s community of Hellenist converts. A gifted evangelist, he preached in this community and discussed religious matters with members of synagogues for Diaspora Jews.What is St. Stephen best known for?During one debate with Diaspora Jews, Stephen\u2019s oratory so offended them that they accused him of blasphemy. He was arrested and charged with speaking against \u201cthis holy place and the law.\u201d Stephen\u2019s spirited defense included the implication that the Temple was idolatrous, comparable to Aaron\u2019s golden calf. He was stoned to death shortly thereafter. How did St. Stephen die?Stephen\u2019s defense of his faith before the Sanhedrin, Jerusalem\u2019s supreme rabbinic court, so enraged his Jewish audience that he was taken out of the city and stoned to death. His final words, a prayer of forgiveness for his attackers, echoed those of Jesus on the cross. The name Stephen is Greek, and chapter 6 of The Acts of the Apostles 6 tells us that he was a Hellenist (a foreign-born Jew who spoke Greek). He lived in Jerusalem and had become a Christian. The Hellenist converts, who probably formed a minority in the early Christian community, complained that the care of their elderly widows was neglected by the Hebrew-speaking majority. The Apostles presented the matter to the congregation and, pleading the press of responsibilities, instructed it to select seven deacons for this community service. They were chosen and ordained, and Stephen, who became the best known of the seven, was recognized as a man with special gifts as an evangelist. He engaged in religious discussions among the adherents of synagogues of Diaspora Jews in the capital. Growth in the number of Jewish converts, including \u201cmany of the priests,\u201d provoked a reaction. He was summoned before the Sanhedrin, the supreme rabbinic court in Jerusalem, and charged with speaking against \u201cthis holy place and the law.\u201d The charge is very general; the report of his defense before the Sanhedrin is the primary resource for learning what Stephen stood for.Stephen\u2019s response was Jewish in its concerns, and in form it followed Hellenistic rhetorical conventions (Joshua 24:2\u201314; Acts of the Apostles 3:12\u201326). Many scholars see a Samaritan connection to Stephen\u2019s community, postulating that it may have migrated there when Jerusalem was destroyed in 70 ce. They assume that the speech may have been modified in its transmission through the years between its delivery and its incorporation in St. Luke\u2019s text which appears as The Acts of the Apostles. In any event, what Stephen seems to say about temple and law would not have displeased Samaritan ears either, though it is probably Stephen\u2019s independent and original conviction.Stephen was bitterly opposed to the Temple in Jerusalem and its sacrificial cult. He revered the Law of Moses but considered the temple cult an illegitimate part of it. For Stephen, Moses was \u201cboth ruler and deliverer\u201d (Acts of the Apostles 7:35); he had delivered \u201cliving oracles,\u201d the true law; and he had promised that God would raise up another prophet (Jesus) as he had raised up Moses (7:37). Stephen seems to think of Jesus as the \u201crestorer of Mosaic religion.\u201d In his discourse, he sets Aaron over against Moses, the Temple over against the tent, and Solomon, who built the Temple, over against David, who was persuaded not to. For Stephen, the building of the Temple was a bit of idolatry, comparable to Aaron\u2019s golden calf; \u201cthe Most High does not dwell in houses made with hands\u201d (7:48).\r\nGet exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription. \r\nSubscribe today\nStephen\u2019s feelings about the Temple seem to have been more completely negative than those of the first Christians generally; the latter, including St. Paul, continued to frequent it. Its sacrificial rites served in many ways to shape the theological interpretation of salvation through the death of Jesus. There is no hint that Stephen assigned doctrinal significance to the death of Jesus. On the other hand, it has been suggested that he may have been the first to anticipate the return (Second Coming) of Jesus. In a moment of rapture, at the close of his apology, he saw the heavens opened and \u201cthe Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.\u201d The title \u201cSon of Man,\u201d with its intensely eschatological-apocalyptic connotations, is used in the New Testament only by Jesus himself, with this single exception from the mouth of Stephen. For St. Paul, Jesus had brought deliverance from the \u201ccurse of the law\u201d (Galatians 3:13). For Stephen, deliverance still awaits the rebirth of the Mosaic tradition in its purity. Though Stephen was an intensely committed follower of Jesus, his faith may have rested as much on the old basis as on the new. Stephen, to whose fate the Pharisee Saul of Tarsus assented, spoke for an overwhelmingly Jewish, pre-Pauline Christian movement, the precise outlines of which are not easily recoverable, because they have been covered by layers of great change.Stephen, SaintSt. Stephen, lindenwood with traces of polychromy by Hans Leinberger (active 1510\u201330), South German, c. 1515\u201320; in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City.

Well worth checking out, I\u2019ve taken a picture of the opening times do you don\u2019t miss out. Wasn\u2019t a wasted trip, I learned it was where the Samaritans was founded.",

          "From the outside this looks like just another old weather-beaten church now surrounded by the modern buildings of finance and people in blue suits. But when it is open , go inside. Christopher Wren who designed St. Paul's Cathedral designed this first and the interior is a",
          "We stepped in to avoid the rain, and were so glad we did. This church, a few steps from St. Paul's, is an absolute gem. Within its modest proportions, Christopher Wren managed to distill everything beautiful and perfect and create an oasis of calm in the bustling city. It is",
          "The relatively simple exterior hides the beauty of Wren's architecture inside which is worth exploring as an oasis of peace in the City. The church was built from 172-9 to replace the previous building which was destroyed in the Great Fire of London and today it sits surrounded",

          "St Stephens is a delightful church: light, no stained glass windows, white walls and white floors. At the centre of the church is a massive white polished stone altar commissioned from the sculptor Henry Moore. Quiet, no busy roads close by. Eventually the Bloomberg building,",
          "Only about ten minutes walk from the Bank of England Museum and near to Mansion House. The church itself is surrounded by glitzy financial buildings . Step inside and be amazed! Just missed the weekly Friday organ recital (12.30 to 1.30) so pencil it in if you're interested. The",
          "This church is very near to Mansion house. It was closed when we went to visit this. So we could see only a small garden in its back yard. A church official was there who informed us about the rich heritage of this church, weekly services, and upcoming events. Could not get",
          "Another of the City of London's gems and a deceptive one at that, seemingly small from the outside but a huge interior, filled with so many wonderful features. This is not only one of Wren's best churches, but even more historic for being the place where the Samaritans was",
          "You certainly cannot judge a book by its covers. Outside it looks like not bothering to open the door, but if you persevere you will be rewarded by a truly remarkable building. The quality of light is the work of brilliance. The clear white walls and ceiling is lifted by the",
          "from the outside you would never expect the church to have such a massive main hall. Its like something out of Dr Who - small on the outside, massive on the in!. Look at the wonderful Henry Moore altar in the center of the church.",
          "If you have an interest in the work of Christopher Wren, then spend time in the City of London to search out several of his parish churches. You won't be disappointed. This church was his practice run prior to building St. Paul. At the time of my visit, an exhibition of the",
          "Set in the middle of City with modern buildings all-round including a Starbucks built on to it. doors were open and glass inviting people to come in for a moment of peace in a busy city.",
          "This is one of Christopher Wrens masterpieces and apparently has a number of design features that he used when building St Paul's. It is a huge space with an incredible dome as well as outstanding plasterwork. The organ was being played when I visited and there was an Exhibition",
          "Christopher Wren's masterpiece and the Lord Mayor's parish church, this domed, airy columned building was built from 1672-79. Wren's original altar and screen and his pulpit with a delicate carved canopy are still here. A polishEd stone altar by Henry Moore was added in 1987",
          "A stunning church full of light. I was fortunate to visit during a lunchtime concert - piano and cello - which was the icing on the cake. Stunning 17th c pulpit and a practice run for Wren's design of St Paul's cathedral. You feel that this had very wealthy patronage and much",
          "Wren built so many churches in London that it is often hard to know which is the most remarkable. St Stephen Walbrook was built in 1672-9. To understand the architecture of the church, you have to realise that the columns are not only are the 16 internal columns laid out in the",
          "July 2004, the precise month when was completely gobsmacked by this church's outstanding acoustics while listening, in two different days, to lunch time organ recitals - which were then part of a celebration of sorts during that month where visiting organists would play during",
          "People of sensitivity still mourn the decision of the Court of Ecclesiastical Causes Reserved to permit the violation of this domed masterpiece in order to embrace the spirit of the times which as we know is always out of date",
          "Many people (including some of the church watchers to whom I spoke, who volunteer to assist visitors to City churches) name this as their favorite Wren church. It's certainly beautiful but leaves me a bit cold. A dome set on eight arches and those in turn on 12 columns plus a",
          "This church seemed nothing special from the outside but inside it is glorious, with the combination of the old Wren structure with a most a magnificent dome and the modern central altar designed by Henry Moore with beautiful golden coloured wooden pews in a circle around it. The",
          "This Church was designed by Sir Christopher Wren and was built in 1680 after the Great Fire of London. The dome is its major feature and the proportions are perfect. It was considered a prototype for St. Paul's Cathedral. There is a feeling of light (it is natural daylight)",
          "Having seen many churches in London already I was really surprised by this little gem. Although a bit boring from outside it is absolutely worth visiting. Not only the altar is magnificent but the whole church. Do not miss it in case you are around!",
          "St Stephen Walbrook is an unexpected find in the midst of oldest London. It looks like nothing special from the outside, but once you enter you'll be impressed by how bright, elegant and spacious everything appears. Christopher Wren worked on this church just before St Paul's",
          "Just beside the Mansion House in the City of London is the church of St Stephen Walbrook. It is lovely. I was walking to a meeting when I saw a sign saying the church was open to the public and that people could show you round the church. The invitation was friendly and I was",
          "Popped in St Stephen Walbrook on a weekday lunchtime to find a Violin recital by Marie Schreer in progress. The recital was free and was very good. The church is much more modern that most in the city: the centre of the church is occupied by a massive white polished stone",
          "Have been to the church a few times and went to the Christmas Carol Concert in mid December. The church was full as we sang carols by candlelight, before mince pies and mulled wine afterwards under the dome. The church is Sir Christopher Wren's parish church and he tried out",
          "On our way to the Sky Gardens, we discovered this little nice church. A quiet place in the middle of the hectic life in the city of Londen.",
          "For many years I worked in the City of London and must have walked past this church thousands of times. I did not realise that it existed. It is one of the many churches in London that was designed by Sir Christopher Wren and replaced those that burnt in the Great Fire of London",
          "Tucked away between Bank and Cannon Street tube stations, there is this gorgeous little church. Fantastically peaceful inside, despite the building site outside (with instructions on the door to close it after you go in to keep it that way). It's a Wren church so the inside is",
          "I can't think of a City of London church which I haven't yet been to, but this one is so interesting and unusual that I have visited several times. It's very close to the 'hub' of the city, the Bank of England/Royal Exchange/Mansion House area, and worth visiting for its",
          "IF you are visiting St Pauls, a short walk will bring you to this 'baby' Wren. I just happened to be passing and went in purely out of curiosity. It is a revelation with its gorgeous dome and lovely bright airy atmosphere. The Henry Moore alter is quite something. Its not my cup",
          "Yesterday visited this beautiful City of London church. Sir Christopher Wren lived in Walbrook so this was his local church and the design is stunning and the atmosphere so calming and uplifting. Full of light and symmetry, the perfect white dome above the modern huge round",
          "Hidden between office buildings and Mansion House it's easy to miss. Because so much is hidden from the street it is amazing to go inside an fin the dome. Another restoration after the Great Fire this church survived WWII losing (as many did) the stained glass windows. Well",
          "This church is wonderful. Completely rebuilt after the London Fire, it is considered to be Wren's signature church and it would be hard to argue. Sadly the stained glass windows were destroyed in WWII and replaced with clear ones. That ended in 1963 when the east windows were",
          "From outside it seems like nothing much but the interior is a revelation: harmonious, symmetrical and filled with light so that you don't at once register how complex the thinking behind it is. This is my favourite space in London and I take everyone I can to see it. Why",
          "Not to be missed by Sir Christopher Wren followers. The complex geometric space and the use of light is extraordinary. A great space to hear a concert. It is a quiet refuge in the heart of the city. The Henry Moore altar will appeal to followers of modern art.",
          "The church is a real oasis in the heart of the city. It is an absolutely beautiful building, Christopher Wren's designs frequently take my breath away but this was by far my favourite of his churches. Rich history and a quiet and peaceful building that has been well preserved",
          "The coffered white arc of the dome spins the viewer round, guying in every axis the facsimile arrangement of angled entablatures over unfluted Corinthian columns, above which tiptoe eight delicate arches for the implied octagonal space; all is white, white, white - and light,"

          "very nicely done! A lot of interesting details and just up my street! The submarine is also an other world to dive in",
          "The museum is focused on the maritime history of Genoa including the ancient Galantines, the fate of the Andrea Doria in the 60th and even modern days. A must see when visiting Genoa!",
          "This beautiful museum is full of intricate models, paintings and art . It even has a full size galley to wall through. This museum tells the story of Genoa and the port history. The 5 levels of the museum allow one to spend minutes or an hour appreciating the information",
          "Well, the negative part of this marine museum is the complete A**hole working at the ticket desk. Grey hair, glasses. This guy is a rude ignorant piece of S**t. Apart from him, there is plenty to see and for the most part is interesting. We also went into the submarine which was",
          "I don't know if this museum gets crowded during the day, but I went at 5:00 (it closes, at least some days, at 7:30) and was practically alone, which was great. The treatment of Italian emigration on the third floor, followed by recent immigration to Italy, is phenomenal - I",
          "Be sure to visit the submarine, but not if you are tall or claustrophobic!! And leave time for the top floor for the Italian emigration exhibit!",
          "This place is very interesting and you need to allow atleast 1-2 hours when visiting this place. For history lovers, allow atleast 3 hours and dive into the past of this wonderful city of Genoa. Highly recommend.",
          "We allowed 3 hours and only got through 3 floors, BUT we are big history buffs.This also may be due to the fact that it was not always obvious which way to go when going from one room to another, and there were zero \"guides\" around -this is my only criticism. So much history of",
          "This is a very well presented maritime museum however it was very disappointing not to have more English translations. Note to the museum ... not everyone visiting speaks Italian!",
          "I was expecting a simple maritime museum but on one of the upper floors they have a fantastic experience of being a emigrant from Italy in the early 20th century. Showing how life was like on the ships, but also including the port of exit and arrival. Really good and well worth",
          "This is 5 floors of great and interesting Maritime exhibits - the higher you go the more I was surprised - ending with the fatal collision of the Andrea Doris and the Stockholm (also very much liked the immigration exhibit and the roof top garden - with great views). A lot of",
          "This place is huge and it covers a lot of history. Happily, there are many places where you can sit down and rest. We spent over 3 hours there and ran out of energy before we ran out of museum, so that we kind of raced through about half of it. It vividly points out the",
          "Maritime museums wouldn't normally interest me but we wanted views from the top floor ( be warned, its entire surrounded by glass so not the best photos but still beautiful to see) The museum is excellent though. I found it very interesting and we ended up spending quite some",
          "This is a well-designed, very well-presented maritime museum in a city that used to be a major naval power in the Mediterranean for centuries. That would be enough to give it an \"excellent\" rating. The more-than-excellent exhibition about migrants' experiences was something that",
          "We went with our 5 and 2 year old boys and they both enjoyed it. The 5 year old more. Big and interesting. A big downside is that all info is *not* available in English which is really bad. A lot of things was available for kids to \u201dtry\u201d like whole ships and cannons etc.",
          "This is an excellent museum, well worth the entrance fee and a great way to spend at least a couple of hours. The full size ships and the way they have been furnished is incredible. I went with my partner and we were both blown away by this place. It's a real history of Genoa",
          "Very high quality museum with lots of interesting insights into Genoa's past. We came away with a might broader understanding of how Genoa was created and expanded. One slight thing to note was that there was a bit of a inconsistent approach to English being using on the",
          "Firstly we had a reduction to E9 with a museum card. I must admit that initially I was sceptical about visiting this museum as usually they are quite boring. However, this was the exception. You have 4 floors of exhibitions and it took us over 2 1/2 hours and we did not include",
          "As Genoa has a very important role in the history of the medieval period (Columbos...), the visit in this naval museum gives a lot of information and feelings of that period. Very interesting.",
          "I visited this museum with my 6 y.o. daughter and I was impressed how good it was. Very rich in didactics and exciting also for young children, who do not get bored at all thanks to the interactive installations and the wide spaces where they can explore and experience different",
          "Held a maritine conference here and the facilities and food were excellent. Helpful and friendly staff even if some of them didn't speak English to well. The museum itself is with a visit whether attending a conference it not and the view from the roof is wonderful.",
          "Some really interesting displays about the position of Genoa over the centuries but almost too big. Not much that would appeal to children. Displays on migration patterns from Genoa and the story of the sinking of a transatlantic liner in the 60's were the highlights after the",
          "We went here as the weather was not great and wanted something to do indoors. The staff on the front desk didn't really seem that bothered, both on their phones and talking to each other instead of asking us if we were okay and needed any help. we requested 2 tickets and",
          "The museum is large - 4 floors, with lots of interesting exhibits. Only trouble is the explanation for almost all of them are only in Italian, so couldn't get a good appreciation of the articles. Still worth a visit.",
          "The skill of the Genoese in ship building and maritime trading are so well explained in the museum. The models, some full scale give a great insight into how trade built this wonderful city. The standout is the submarine S518 which is moored in the harbour and can be visited to",
          "So we were waiting in Genoa very close to the port next to the Church of Mary Magdalen \"Chiesa di Santa Maria Maddalena\" in an air B+B to pick up a cruise ship headed to Brazil. We had a couple of days to wander around this exceptional port city. Not being very bright we were",
          "Four floors of Genoa history. Plenty of exhibits for all ages, nearly all have an English translation. An interesting reconstruction of a 17th century galley, beautiful globes and atlases, plus a fantastic story of emigration and immigration, with photos, videos etc. See life",
          "A fascinating museum on four floors that takes visitors through Genoa\u2019s seafaring past with stunning replicas of life size and model ships through the ages as well as many informative exhibits of conditions and life aboard many of the famous vessels that sailed out of Genoa.",
          "This museum was huge! Plan on spending at least half your day here, there are 5 floors! Each section was about a different historical marine event or time period starting from Genoa\u2019s establishment all the way through the steamship era. Everything was extremely informative and",
          "What a wonderful visit. What i really like about this museum is the diversity of each floor. There are many interactive areas and many big ships. I suggest people look for a guide, as we did, to make the experience more gratifing. Be sure to see the terrace on top, it might take",
          "I knew Genoa had great maritime history but the true extent was displayed in the excellent museum right on the water front. We spent a full half day in the museum and there was more to see and do. The displays and artifacts were very well done and many were very interactive.",
          "This new museum on Genoa\u2019s waterfront offers an intensive and in depth immersion in Genoa\u2019s long history as a naval power and center of shipping. The exhibits start with the development of Genoa\u2019s harbor and proceeds through: a full size galleon ship, a display on Christopher",
          "Good experience. A nice place to spend an afternoon. The submarine was very nice. I recommend it to everybody.",
          "My wife and I visited the Maitime Museum in Genoa. There was so much history and you could board different vessels inside the 5 storeyed museum. We spent nearly 3 hours there for 13 Euros per person and an additional 6 Euros to visit the inside of a submarine. It is highly",
          "This is a great place for adults and kids, sorry teenagers ! You will learn all about the might and glory from Genoa great navigation period and get to see a model of a 1500 vessel, also a grest aperitivo in the last floor",
          "Full scale Galleon that you can explore, wonderfully detailed models, responsive audio visual displays and amazing original art work all contribute to an understanding of Genoa and its boating heritage. The staff are smiling and friendly. The spaces are dark and art work could",
          "A great experience very informative from the beginning of the Italian sailing right through to modern times. An experience inside a real submarine is well worth the visit. 5 floors which can be a little confusing navigating round each floor as the direction signs are in obvious.",
          "we did the trip and the sub marine tour very good museum get there easily as it dose get busy and very noisy with Italians talking loudly not too much of the exhibits in English but still worth a visit epically the tour of the migrants from 1900 the sub is also good take your",
          "As befits a world class seaport with a long and impressive history of seafaring, Genoa has an equally stunning maritime museum. Like most Italian museums, it's full of interesting hands-on, interactive exhibits, of which its section detailing Italian immigration to the US",
          "Was really looking forward to visitingthis as Genoa has a fascinating maritime history. We were not disappointed. Indeed we spent 3 enthralling hours here but could have spent much longer. An audio guide cost just \u20ac1. The museum starts its maritime story with 2 huge photos of",
          "This is a beautiful museum with a huge number of artifacts, painting, maps and etchings from Genoa's and Italy's history, but we were disappointed in how little effort was made in any language but Italian. There is an audio guide that you pay for but it only covers a few of the",

          "Large, modern museum only a few minutes walk from the Aquarium in Genoa. Full of artefacts, reconstructions of ships you can explore, interactive displays and information. The area devoted to immigration and emigration over the decades is particularly good and bang up to date.",
          "This is a large museum with several different sections. To start with, you'll get to know about Christopher Columbus followed by history of Genova (it's port and the city). You'll be able to get on board of old ships and learn what the life of seamen was like during the time of",
          "Probably the highlight of our visit to Genoa. Loads to see and do. The place is huge and seems to go on and on, up and up. Be careful not to spend too long on the lower floors and not have enough time and energy for the upper decks. The exhibition on migration, for example, is",
          "Given Genoa's history as one of the great seafaring and trading city-state historic nations, it's only fitting that Italy's largest maritime museum is located here. Designed by architect Guillermo Vasquez Consuegra, the museum gives a new life to the former arsenal of the",
          "Very nice place :) Please do not miss the Boat, The kids from 17-5 years enjoy the exhibitions :) one child is free of charge from the three!",
          "Hello, We were at this Maritime Museum and we loved it. The downside is that they have a real submarine that you can visit but the kids below 4 years are not allowed. Anyway go and visit it, because you will not be disappointed. Enjoy!",
          "A very detailed and absorbing museum, if you are interested in all things maritime; naval history and warfare, seafaring, Genoa and the sea, exploration, migration, even sea myths and monsters. Some of the earlier sections are not so well lit, and a few of the exhibits are not",
          "We visited the museum under my other half's insistence. As someone who is not particularly interested in boats I warn all others alike me that this is not for you. This is 3 hours (at a quick pace) of model boats, paintings of boats, information about boats and a couple of life",
          "We loved the museum, especially the interactive parts like the galea and the emigration \"trip\" It is classic and innovative at the same time",
          "Took our 7 and 9 year olds here in June and we all loved it. The immigrant exhibit on the 4th floor was fantastic, we learned so much and the kids were truly fascinated by learning about the people they got assigned to follow. The museum was fairly empty on a weekday afternoon",
          "The museum is worth a visit if you have an interest in the sea and maritime history. There is a lack of english explanation on the exhibits so can be hard to follow if you aren't versed in the finer points. However it is Italy so why should we expect english? I believe there is",
          "There are lovely points like reali life models of ships. Some aspects didn\u2019t meet our understanding. Hence there were no signs in English, though overall it is very nice place to see and visit.",
          "TOURIST TRAP and almost nothing translate to English!!! if you dont understand italian, avoid please! (Maybe if you understand it could worth, not sure).",
          "This is a great museum to visit. My only tip is to ask if they have any headphones for English commentary- we were not given any but there were signs on the way around stating number points for English commentary. Some displays have English and others not, do this would have",
          "The time flew past on our visit to this museum. It is very engaging and a lot of effort has gone into bringing various exhibits to life. A little Italian would be helpful but not a pre-requisite. Would definitely recommend paying the extra for the submarine and the emigration",
          "The Galata Museo del Mare offers a unique perspective on Maritime history...much more than just Columbus, Genova's native son.",
          "As good a maritime museum as I have seen anywhere in the world - possibly even better than Bremerhaven. My only criticism is the apparent lack of staff and attendants, both to welcome you and to supervise the exhibits. This is in stark contrast to the trio of art museums in town",
          "Beautiful museum. But not for foreign tourists. You can ask for an audioguide, but there is so much noise in the museum that it is almost impossible to understand the audioguide. Above all is the explanation that you get too brief. A pity if you ask me.",
          "This museum is amazing if you like history and art. It traces the History of Genoa from Middle Age to now, focusing on special point with interactive means. It takes time to discover everything but it is worth it. You learn a lot about life with the sea, aboard a ship,",
          "Apart from the rooftop seating area which had fantastic views I wouldn\u2019t personally rush to go here- unless of course you are dotty about ships",
          "We were 7 family members with 2 kids, ages 8 and 10. The museum is very well laid out, with several places with interactive displays. Kept the kids very engaged in the tour.",
          "While most of this place is in Italian (as you would expect) there was enough English that you can work it out. It gave me a much better insight into the Italian seafaring history that I had never understood before. I loved the way the had made the higher floors feel like the",
          "I thought this would be a niche museum and only went to see it on my last morning as my museum card gave me access and I had a few hours before my train. I'm very glad I did. It's a fascinating museum, which would be ideal for families with children as it's very interactive. The",
          "Get a historical overview about the harbour of genoa of the last centuries, it has its price, but they took many efforts to illustrate the historical development. story of emigration from europe, andrea doria, 4d simulation with beeing on rough sea (must see!), very impressive",

          "To be honest we only had time for a quick visit here but the submarine was interesting and fun and the Genoese longship was amazing. My son loved it in here. We bought the multi ticket which is valid for a year so might make another visit before we head home.",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to this museum. An array of exhibitions, collections of art and replica boats to have a play on. There is so much history across the four floors that you should allow plenty of time to see everything. Also be sure to take the elevator to the roof",
          "A big museum on 4 floors packed with interesting stuff. If you are interested to see a little of everything connected to travel, sea , history and immigration- this is a please to go. It is mostly Italian but has a lot of English plates too. The museum is modern, interactive",
          "Wow, wow, wow! GMdM is maybe the best marine museon I ever have visited. First of all Genoa is not a town: Genoa is sea and huge harbor. GMdM tells all the roots of Genoa. There is lot to for everyone: ships, guns, clothes, maps... even music. Museum tells history of Genoa, why",
          "I really enjoyed the diversity of this museum, touching on Genoa\u2019s history in cruise industry, Italian emigration, naval war history, etc. Most interesting maritime museum I have ever visited.",
          "A good view of Italy's maritime past. Highlights for me were the historic Genoese maps and the model of the Genoese Galley. The story of Italian emmigration was also very well told, with lots of videos and an excellent mock-up of the emigrants sleeping quarters. The jobsworth",
          "This is a great museum, telling you everything you need to know about Genoa's long relationship with the sea.",

          "This large museum takes you through maritime history as it pertains to Italy, Genova, and globally. It is well thought out and takes you through logically successive steps from the 15th century up until modern times, explaining the progression as you go from ground floor to the",
          "Time spent in Galata is really worth. Learn on life at sea and ocean and the exhibit on emigrants past and current is amazing! Migration and inclusion. Andrea Doria Ship story is fascinating and you can\u2019t miss the view from the terrace. Fun and learning for adults and kids! Just",
          "We visited with one 4 years old and one 14 years old and they were both delighted. There are things to see and to experience for all ages. Museum is architectural wonder and it is so well organised and interestingly presented that you won\u2019t be bored. I liked the emigration",
          "Several floors ... You need audio guide , limited english descriptions. Good reproductions of older ships. A little ecclectic in terms of topics, emigration, immigration, boat designs, etc",
          "Great museum dedicated to Genoese maritime history, ships and people's lives. It is very interesting and lots of exhibits are interactive. There are also a 4D storm simulation and few real life models of ships and a submarine. The museum is so big and attractive that you would",
          "A fascinating experience with so much to see and do - especially for younger visitors. I particularly enjoyed the display of old maps and the 'emigrazione e immigrazione' exhibition on the third floor. So well presented and explained!",

          "Obviously the history of Genova sailing is beautifully presented but the details of the Andrea Dora, the immigration experience of the 1900-1930\u2019s Italian, and the. Wham-oh, the immigrants in the boats landing at Lampedusa etc. Go on a hot or rainy day and stay 3 hours. You",

          "It's big - on 5 floors plus the submarine! You start off on the ground floor with some historical facts on Cristopher Columbus then up to lean how the Genovese made their stupendous wealth. On the second floor you can steer a ship and learn about storms and shipwrecks, while on",
          "I loved this, it was very interactive, you need about 2 hours to fully enjoy the experience but it's really worth it",
          "What a great museum! We all really enjoyed it and underestimated how long we would spend there. The museum is on 4/5 floors and gets better and better as you go up. A lot of Maritime history but also current information on migration from an Italian perspective and globally. We",
          "As others have put it before me, it is indeed much larger than it looks. It is very meticulously organized by floors and themes, and the exhibits are not only amazingly detailed, accurate and masterfully preserved, they are also very engaging. Not just a dusty piece of history",
          "We went with our 7 years old son and we LOVED it! It is a good 2-3 hours spent filled with history of Genoa and its maritime power. Really interesting and is definitely suitable for young kids, adolescents and adults. We would highly recommend it and we would also recommend to",
          "Some wonderful exhibits including two full size ships. Covers Genova's links with the sea from pre Columbus to the present day. Only disappointment was that despite the great presentations and information, quite a lot of these have no translation.",

          "A must see for a marine enthusiast...tells a great deal about the history of Genoa. Equally Insightful for young children and adults. The museum transforms you to the world of high seas. You learn a great deal about history, and can also relate to a lot of movies made on high",

          "We were really impressed with the exhibits here. Highlight was an immersive exhibition which puts you in the shoes of early 20th century Italian emigrants. Also there is a cool exhibit on the horrors of the sea in pop culture",
          "I liked the museum and it was a worthwhile couple of hours. as mentioned by others the signs directing you around the exhibits are poor in some places. The audioguide was OK but needs more input. Person at the cash desk was a bit stroppy. Maybe it was a bad day for her.",

          "A wonderful museum, especially the re-creation of the experiences of emigrants in the 19th/20th centuries",
          "Very interesting but also very big museum (reserve maybe 2-3 hours). All of it was interesting but it was almost too much. The highlight was the submarine at the end. You'll need to pick up your hard hats near the ticket counter first. Didn't find the sub to claustrophobic at",
          "I was really knocked out by this place. It is amazingly well put together and well displayed. There is all the history (some wonderful paintings of Genoa) but then there are whole boats for you to clamber round! A must see.",

          "why it was special...because galata is a district of istanbul and in the beginning it was founded by the people of genoa...genoese people came to constantinople (istanbul) and constructed the galata tower to check thier maritime commerce.so it was a review of those days as well",
          "Interesting but a bit chaotic and overrun with noisy children - although as parents ourselves we were happy to see youngsters there. We particularly appreciated the 4th floor exhibition on emigration. On the other floors, we found the full-size ships and maps interesting.",

          "The museum is built in an ancient buinding in which the 'galere', the ships of the Republic of Genoa were built. The museus tells the story of the city and of the Republic, his relation with the sea, the commerces and the seatravels. The recostruction of a 'galea and of a brig,",
          "Great museum shop and the museum has something for all ages. Particularly enjoyed the sections where you walk through ships, the 4D experience and the exhibit about immigration. Wish I'd been offered the audio guide....I read and speak Italian but not all",
          "5 floors of museum with life-size replica boats. For me the best sections were the ones on migration which had some good interactive displays. Good views from roof.",
          "This museum, while filled with interesting objects, was badly signed, especially for those not speaking Italian.",
          "On the ground floor you will begin your journey through the maritime history of Genoa. The exhibits explain the development of the port and it's importance in the history of trade, the way the port itself was constructed and the types of vessels using it. The exhibits even",
          "I went to see for 20 years but the museum was educational. The vessels that you could walk through were amazing. The walk in model in the emigration section gave me a new appreciation of what my ancestors went through to make a new life in America.",
          "Despite reading minimal Italian we spent an interesting three hours in the museum. Huge range of exhibits on a nautical theme: learnt about zombies, kraken, the Italian diaspora to South America, how to row a galley and why Christopher Columbus definitely came from Genoa. Plus",
          "Great museum, especially if you're into naval exploration and history in general. Takes you way back when Genoa was a superpower. Seriously amazing installations, very interactive, probably one of the best thought out museums I've ever been to, and I've been to a lot. Bring your",
          "The museum has gone to s lot of trouble and expense to tell the story of the ancient port and sailing history in Genoa. This will not be to everyone's liking but if a bit of history is your thing then this could be for you. Very family friendly with everyone able to climb on",
          "Interesting models of ships interesting maps. Not enough activating things to do for children. Adults and teensger kids only.",
          "We bought joint Galata Museum and Acquarium tickets. They were not cheap, but the Galata part of the ticket was definitely worth it. First of all, at the entrance nobody checked our tickets. We just wandered in and out without being challenged. The first two floors were OK;",
          "I didn't expect too much from this museum, but they surprised me with big collection of various items, and with many interactive display how it was. It is very huge and you can spend 2+ hours to explore it. Ticket is 12\u20ac.",
          "If you had an afternoon to spare, then this is the place to go! Very interactive exhibitions, a fab balcony cafe, and gorgeous views from the top floor as surrounded by glass! A very nice place to escape the heat - took us 3 hours but could do it in less time! There were",
          "Spent 2-3 hours exploring just the first couple of floors of this museum. Love the history of the development of the city of Genoa & it's significant contributions to the Age of Exploration. Highly recommended!!!",
          "It was such a beautiful experience! It's not just about the history of the city, it is much more! So interractive! We had a lot of fun. I only regret I couldn't stay more inside!",
          "We enjoyed a few hours wandering around this museum and the submarine attached at the time. A fascinating history into the shipping and life aboard. Some great exhibts that would appeal to any age.",
          "very interesting both for adults and children has a very large and nice exhibition hall, a place you must see in Genova",
          "The navigation world in 4 floors. Ship replicas, maps and navigation tecnology. I spent more than 2 hours there. A bit tiring, but it is interesting.",
          "Very interesting museum that offers information regarding the maritime history of Genoa. Fun for the whole family. Highly recommend it!!! The gift shop is nothing special but the museum itself is awesome.",
          "When in Genoa don\u2019t forget that this is one of the most important maritime cities of the Mediterranean \u2013 with the largest maritime museum in the Mediterranean. Situated in the harbor it is part of AcquarioVillage with a number of attractions. See it for yourself and feel like",
          "Not as interesting as our UK maritime history because there is less of it. Aspects of American discovery and the struggles between the great city states of the Mediterranean and the great emigrant exodus to the USA were new to us. Negatives were the queue for tickets and the",
          "You can see the history of marine and progress in medieval vessels. The history of Genoa harbour is also well presented.",
          "Took two kids (7 and 9). It was interesting but not amazing. I would have rented the audio guide if I had been offered it. Didn't realize it was option until 1/2 through. Most signs are not in English so it was difficult to really grasp the details of lots of it. Some ares",
          "We spent around 2 hours here, good value for 12\u20ac. We spent 1\u20ac each on the audio tour in English which is essential as most captions are in Italian only. The museum is interesting and well laid out. Some good exhibits fir children to clamber on too. We left with a better",
          "In a rainy Saturday we decided to visit the Acquario and while looking for the ticket\u2019s options, I went across this museum. I was intrigued by the possibility to visit also a submarine anchored nearby and we bought the combo ticket (discount price). Best decision ever!!!! I",
          "Even though it was a rainy day, I had decided against paying a rather large entrance fee to the museum itself and was actually coming out of the Movie Museum when my attention was drawn to the 'rotating platform' on the edge of the harbour. I was intrigued and then impressed",
          "We didn't really like the flow of the museum, finding it very confusing. It was also mostly in Italian, which, for those not reasonably fluent in the language, would be a real struggle.",
          "I am not really interested in maritime history, but this museum was a good choice to spend two hours on a rainy day. Unfortunately the submarine was closed due to the bad weather, but inside a building you can find rather interesting exhibitions. I really enjoyed the upper level",
          "This was an amazing find. Get the English audio guide and learn about Genoa's storied history at sea. This modern museum is housed next to the harbor. Be sure to visit the roof top for the views. You can go through their emigration display, and travel as an Italian emigrant.",
          "For those loving the maritime history this is the place to spend a full morning. The infrastructe is of world class. Having visited various maritime museans in the world, this, by far is the best. Can be visit with youngsters as it is very well cured.",
          "Worth the time. I learned a lot about Christopher Columbus. Also there was very detailed information about ships and the people that rode them. I was surprised about the information. There was also an area about emigrants going overseas.",
          "Lots of details to read about the Genoa history in maritime activities. There are some real size reproductions to visit and outside also a real small submarine.",
          "we wanted visit just the submarine (well worth the visit) but we had to purchase the whole full price ticket of the museum. we didn't have much time so we had to skip the museum and PAY FULL PRICE anyway! 46Euros for 10 minutes visit of the submarine. Luckily it was just us, so",
          "Very exiting destination for children especially the last two floors. Adults too can appreciate the history of this city. I very much liked the exhibition about migration.",
          "Really well laid out and interesting. There are some explanation boards in English but if I went again I would go for the audio guide.",
          "This site has a museum featuring the evolution of the port and especially the immigrants who passed thru here on their way to the US over 100 years ago- my great grandparents included!",
          "Not boring at all like some museums. History but also fun in the storm room where a 3D storm is simulated. Have a try and also enjoy the terrace on top with stunning view.",
          "The museum seems to be very interesting, but the day of the visit it was crowed with little noisy and misbehaved children, and we couldn't stay very long. We thought however that the structure of the visit could be different, with a clear introduction leading to the historic",
          "This museum was the first thing I visited in Genova. I didn't found it incredible, but it wasn't horrible. I would describe it as decent. I visited also the submarine. The price was very high for the experience and the staff was pretty bored and not very nice. They gave me some",
          "Galata museum is a great way to spent half day in Genoa. It is an interactive museum were kids can see ships in real size, touch, play and experience the sailing. Apart from ships display it has some hidden gems such as three of the Christopher Columbus original letters or the",
          "Interesting and well laid out with reconstructions of life at sea and the story of emigration. Earphones available for info in English at 1\u20ac, which is recommended, as there are limited details on exhibits in other languages. Submarine visit at end great too...hard hats provided",
          "Leave yourself lots of time to explore the endless rooms and information on maritime history - local (Christopher Columbus, etc) and global. I'm not a history of ship buff, but I found it very interesting. Our 11 and 12 year olds loved it too. Our favourite sections were on",
          "This museum uses a range of media to richly describe the maritime history of this town of the sea. The explanations are fulsome and detailed, and the displays are interesting and draw you it to the discussion of the history of the town and port. It is a museum that is worth",
          "It's a must for both history lovers and any those interested in whatever regards sea. Don't miss it!",
          "I skipped this museum the first time I was in Genoa, but was so glad to have made the time to explore it this visit. Make sure you get the museum pass if you will be in the city for a few days as it includes entrance to the Marine museum as well as 19 others. The marine",
          "We did the package where we visited both the aquarium and museum! We had a really enjoyable time. Joining aboard the ship was my favourite part as you got given a character to follow! Definitely worth a visit especially on a rainy day!! Fun for all the family and would recommend",
          "We visited on an inclusive ticket, loads of walking over many floors, a hard day for the less mobile. Loads of histoy, LOTS TO READ!. For us, it got better an more interesting the higher we went, but so much walking, after the aquarium.",
          "Worth a visit, we combined our ticket with the aquarium and the submarine, we booked our tickets online the night before using our free wifi at the hotel, it gave us at least 15euros discount. The museum is vast, interactive too so ideal for children as well as adults. Highly",
          "This museum is a must for anyone with any interest in Maritime history or a love of the sea and boats. The exhibits are very well thought out with a lot of interactive features and when you think you're nearly at the end, it keeps going! Obviously most of the information is in",
          "Make sure you pick up a leaflet with details of what is on each floor, and this museum is included on the 24/48 hour museum ticket. The museum is a very short walk along the sea front from the Acquarium. From the top floor you get a good city view with various landmarks pointed",
          "This is a beautiful new museum on the harbor. It contains displays on Genoa's maritime history, including full-scale models of galleys and other boats. There are maps, paintings, and lots of interactive displays for children. It treats everything from mercantile success to the",
          "This museum is located in a centuries old Genoa portside building. Basic admission is 12 Euros for adults and 10 Euros for seniors and military. An additional 5 Euros is required for admission to the recent vintage submarine moored alongside. Audio devices are available for",
          "Three floors of history for this amazing museum along the seaside in the Porto Antico area. First floor dedicated to medieval times with a real ship under constraction in the old shipyard which was based there in the old times. Second floor for more modern times with",
          "This is a fabulous maritime museum. The exhibits chronicle the history of the port and the contributions of local-born famous navigators. The atlases, maps, painting and photographs are a treasure chest of interesting artefacts. The inclusion of the galley, the slave ship Anna",
          "Provides an insight into the history of Genoa. A range of displays to see and a great view from the top floor of the harbour. Very interesting.",
          "Although I didn't get to go on the submarine, I did enjoy my wander through this museum. I spent a long time listening/watching to a video presenting various maps of the city and its change over time and I can imagine that families with kids would have a great time climbing over",
          "Very popular, can get quite crowded. Take your time, there is a lot to see. They have lifts for kids buggies, older people etc.",
          "I've been looking forward to visiting this museum for months now. I love the sea and have sailed since I was a child so I was very excited when we got to the museum. When we got to the desk, we asked if the displays were in english and were told that yes. The first section (a",
          "Contrary to what many reviewers said I didn't find this museum really interactive. That was probably because most of the explanations and films were in Italian only and we didn't take the audio guide. We didn't get as far as the third floor where the immigration exposition is -",
          "We spent a few hours in the Galata Museo del Mare and thoroughly enjoyed it. We took the English audio guide and it was worthwhile as most of the written information on the displays is in Italian. The museum is over a number of levels so there is a lot of walking but there are",
          "We had wanted to visit for a while and only got round to it during this year's trip. It was well worth it. The museum has a good balance of more intellectual aspects and information as well as interactive elements (and I say this as an adult - the interactive aspects are",
          "We've visited the museum on the 11th of Aprilie 2015 and it is fascinating... the scene of the two lovers on the Titanic is a verry good idee",
          "This is a good history of Italian Immigration, the port, shipping and general Naval. We took about two hours touring the museum and probably should have taken longer. But there was a large group of school children behind us and we wanted to stay ahead where is was more quiet.",
          "Spread over 4 floors and a floating submarine exhibit you need some time to do this place justice The history of the city and port is detailed and clearly for those interested to spend the time and the same holds true of the evolution of navigation and instruments The replica",
          "We spent a few hours at this great museum. For anyone with a passing interest in the history of the sea and Genoa's role. Great exhibits, interactive displays, scale model replicas giving you a feel for life on the sea. My wife enjoyed our visit here. She had doubts at first.",
          "It's a very nice museum for adults and children. A lot of boats you can get in to. Two flaws: 1. Not a lot of English explanations. 2. A lot of stairs, very inconvenient with a child's stroller.",
          "This is a must see attraction in Genoa. In any case there are not many maritime museums around, but going to one in one of the most famous shipping cities is a definite must in my book. The museum btw is huge and very well organised. A problem is the lack of descriptions in",
          "This reasonably priced museum is just a few steps down the quai. It richly tells the story of The Republic of Genoa and the city's subsequent maritime history. Lots of multimedia, there are many interactive exhibits. Excellent for children and not crowded, even on a Summer",
          "Good day out in the Museum. really enjoyed it as did my son. If you pay a little extra you can visit the submarine. Well worth it!",
          "Great experience and very interesting to explore. Everything has English translation. The museum is very close to the aquarium. The kids enjoyed the most the submarine visit!!",
          "The museum tells you about the nautical aspect of Genoa from the Dark ages and until the present day. The installations are nothing short of amazing and the museum is very coherent: as you go through different rooms, you are being treated to a story, rather than a series of",
          "Like others we found there wasn't enough in English and my Italian is too limited as yet to be of any help. Some of the exhibits are a bit 'dry' but the replica ships are pretty good. For us though the star of the show is the section on Italian emigration to the Americas. Really",
          "We were really hoping that this museum would explain a lot about Genoa's association with the sea and in particular Christopher Columbus, who was allegedly born there although nobody seems entirely sure, but unfortunately (though not unsurprisingly) almost everything was written",
          "We were a little hesitant about going because of the price, \u20ac12 for adult \u20ac7 for a student, but it was very cool and took up a couple hours of our day. They had a lot of interesting information and exhibits about the life at sea. The only downside was that about half the stuff",
          "It is a real travel through the history of navigation and new lands exploration! Visiting this museum means travelling by see as sailor, passenger or migrant experiencing the hard life on board, the severe storms that can lead to wreck and the high- or low-level services",
          "I went to this museum based on other's reviews here on TA. To be honest, this was a solid 3 stars for most of my visit. Many of the displays didn't have English translations, and many of those that did were a little hard to understand. I got the audio guide (extra 1 Euro),",
          "I think the Italian Americans would love this as it includes a really well done exhibition on emigration to the USA. Overall a good mix of interactive and informative. Some of the explanations are only in Italian so take the audio guide if you want all the information. Only in",
          "This was the highlight on our trip to Genoa. The museum has everything you can imagine and more. Very informative, interesting and appealing. Never have I had so many emotional experiences in a museum before. Didn't expect to find large boats, oil paintings and miniature figures",
          "Usually an hour is enough for me around a museum, This one is so varied and well presented, travelling through the history of Genoa and linking up with the todays issues with immigration, My favourite bit was the interaction of going through customs as if emigrating to USA, I",
          "This was a very interesting museum with a wide variety of exhibits related to maritime activity. There were many artifacts from Christopher Columbus, including letters that he had written. There were several replicas of ships, some of which could actually be boarded. There were",
          "Coming from Australia 95% of the population are of immigrant stock .... so the displays of immigrants leaving for distant lands have real relevance",
          "We dropped by for lunch passing through to the ferry terminal had pizza and spaghetti we sat watching the boats had blass of acidic house white but the bottled beer was cold and cheap.if only some one made the effort with the presentation. the view was the best bit",
          "It may not be clear from the outside, but this museum is really big. Can easily spend the whole day there. I really enjoyed the reconstruction of ships, from the old days up to submarine (a real one!). We had to cut the visit short to catch the train, but I would have stayed",
          "Because Genoa was such a major sea power this museum is really one that covers much of the history of the city. There are a wonderful mix of charts, models and art relating to its naval history. It also has a section about the emigration of many Italians to the new world and",
          "this is a great museum....not only do you get to learn all about Genova's history as a naval port, but you also get to climb aboard ships, enter into a submarine, and you see a relic holding Christopher Columbus's ashes.....",
          "Walked around the museum for a couple of hours. Most of the information is in Italian. There seemed to be in-depth descriptions of objects and paintings in Italian, with only the names written in English. I understand that I am in Italy, but all of the other museums seemed to",
          "What a fantastic museum. Informative, & a great hands on section of a galleon. 2 life size replicas you can walk onto as well as walk through exhibition of the immigration experience.",
          "A great museum, even for less nautical types. Plenty of hands-on stuff for kids. Don't miss the submarine!",
          "Well worth a visit, nice aquarium but original galleon ship is fantast worth an hour roaming around the galleon and nice view of harbour. Cafe's all along the front near aquarium.",
          "We spent an entire day here with the four kids, and after having seen so many churches in museums in Genoa,this was a welcome break for all of us. As advertised, the place is huge, and has something for everyone of all ages. My only minor complaint is the price, which came out",
          "especially as representations that the old ships and objects from the former time are impressive. The best we liked the presentation of the immigrants who fled to America in 1900. Quite simply stunning and really very well done. My daughter is determined to keep this museum for",
          "Wasn't really going to many museums as this was more a walking outdoor holiday. Decided to try the maritime museum even tho I am not really into ships. Go go go to this museum and if you have kids bring them. The 3D movies, the sound effects through out are really fun and",
          "In the old port of Genia lies this submarine that could easily go unnoticed. Visit the whole Marine museum and in the ticket the submarine visit is included!",
          "That is a very nice museum if you like the history of the navegations. But is ashame that is not much translation to english. its big, you need at least 3h.",
          "It is huge, you need like 2-3 hours to see everything. It's beautiful, super interesting, very well organized. A very complete museum with a lot of interesting info from the Cristoforo Colombo era. Just pay for the museum, there is a submarine that you have to pay a little",
          "The obvious glory of this museum is the reconstructed classic Genoese galley on the ground floor but the real star attractions th top floor devoted to the experience of some 2 million Italians who emigrated in the late nineteenth centuries from their harsh live as peasants for a",
          "In this new, modern museum you can discover more about immigration in the 1800's, Christopher Columbus, navigation, etc. You can also enter into real submarine and the rooftop is amazing for taking pictures of the entire city.",
          "We planned to spend a morning here but there was so much to see and it was such an informative and interesting place it took the most part of a day. Thoroughly enjoyable and I would highly recommend it.",
          "I visited this museum in February. This is the best maritime museum that I have ever been too. It is informative and interactive. Everything is in Italian but that doesn't make the experience any less fun. I have been there twice and I plan on going again the first opportunity I",
          "If you are into the sea either modern or historical this place is fantastic. Make sure you get the translators if you don't speak Italian as when you get your ticket and passport for your immigration to America you will miss a lot. You do need the head phones for the whole",
          "Excellent museum, a very pleasant morning. Four floors, airy exhibits well spaced out and many with English interpretations. Several walk on displays of Ships. Many paintings. Many models. Cafe on first floor good for half time break. Also submarine is extra but definitely",
          "There are four floors of museum plus a rooftop view of the city and port. The bottom floor was about Christopher Columbus, exploration, models of Genova in the late 15th century and galleys (rowed vessels). There was a feature about Doria, a local Genovese, who became rich",
          "As several other reviewers have said there's a lot in Italian and if you don't read the language initially that's off-putting\u2026but the pictures and maps often speak for themselves and there are enough films with subtitles to tell the story. The gem is the immigration exhibit,",
          "We only gave ourselves 2 hours to get around the museum and the submarine exhibit, which was just barely enough (I'd say 3 hours would be good). Neither my wife or I can read Italian, but there were enough signs in English that it was still a very informative and interesting",
          "This museum was all about Genoa's links with the sea and as a trading post in past times. Some of the displays are modern but enable kids to actually step on board a galley or a submarine, so in that sense, its good fun for them. Many different displays - shipping instruments,",
          "Much of the information in Italian only and there are LOTS of paintings. We enjoyed the Map Room and the ship.",
          "A good museum overall but the only problem for us was that a significant of the information was in Italian and we are not fluent. That being said, don't let that put you off going as there is enough to get by and still enjoy the experience. The immigration experience was",
          "This a great place for old and young alike. There was alot of english interpretation, and easy to follow guides. We enjoyed the whole thing. Also the cafe seemed like a good place for lunch",
          "This is a great place to learn about the maritime history of Genoa. It also has excellent displays of old ships, maps and globes. One of the highlights is a sensitively constructed exhibit dedicated to emigration from Italy, which effectively conveys the desperation and",
          "If ever you are in Genova, make sure you set aside several hours to half a day for this museum. It details the full origins of Genova as a trading port, and the exhibits walk you through the evolution of vessels, from the galleon to the vessel to the steamship right down to the",
          "This museum really gets into the interesting maritime heritage of Genoa. There's good stuff for all ages. I found the Christopher Columbus stuff, the old maps and globes, and the Italian emigration stuff fascinating. The view from the roof terrace is great for photography.",
          "Wonderful exhibitions, people who really know how to display and present history to people, especially to youngsters",
          "Although we did not find any of our requested names on the computer roles, the exhibit was wonderfully well done, and a great joy to see. It focuses on the areas of emmigration from Italy, from Genoa especially, and their recreations , adding multimedia, make for a really",
          "Excellent museum dedicated to Genoa's heritage with the sea. It has 5 floors and a submarine outside in the water. If you want to read everything you need to spend at least a 4-6 hours but it is worth it if you have the time. Was even able to look up relatives that emigrated",
          "we spent the morning walking about the museum but it coul take more than a day to see all in detail fantastic detail models of the ships fantastic historical collection real scale parts if ship models to walk in real submarine to visit if you don't read italian dont forget to",
          "As part of an inmigrant family coming from Italy and Spain to Southamerica and after hearing the stories from my grandparents so many times, going to this museum was a MUST. It is really impresive how detailed oriented to the life at those times it is and the conditions in",
          "For me the best bit of this museum was the section on galley warfare and the chance to sit on a rowers bench to see how rowing felt. There were lots of great paintings and models to look at as well as lots of activities for kids.",
          "Some very good interactive displays, the best being the emigration section up top where an impatient customs officer awaits. Catch the 11 AM \"wrecked at sea on a life boat\" experience. Wear a hat to keep your head dry. Lasts about 10 minutes but no small children allowed.",
          "If you're interested in the history of ships and ocean work/travel, you won't want to miss the Museum of the Sea in Genoa. Beautiful displays thoughtfully arranged and with excellent explanatory material.",
          "Compared with the excellent Aquarium in Genoa, this museum misses out, mainly by not having enough explanation in anything other that Italian... this makes it unclear where to go and what you are seeing, unless you are of a maritime background and can put the pieces together",
          "The history of Genoa's relationship with the sea starts with Christopher Columbus on the ground floor and slowly unwinds as you climb upwards. The evolvement of the sailing ship is shown by lots of paintings, charts, and beautifully detailed handmade scale models - one",
          "you go to the Acquario, and see the sea-life, ad fish and so on. You come to Galata, and see what mankind did on the sea in Genova, along history. Superb 3d models of the harbor, great gallery of art with the harbor of Genova as represented along the ages. various sections,",
          "While there is very little in English my husband and I found it great good fun. They have full size replicas of brigantines and a galley that you can walk thro. They also have a very good walk though of a ship used by immigrants to the States from Italy.",
          "There are some excellent exhibits about Genoa's long history on the Mediterranean Sea. Not much commentary is in English, but there's enough to get the gist of things. Especially liked the mocked-up boats you could get into, the immigrant boat circa 1900 was great. Who knew that",
          "Tried to visit this museum with the Genoa Museum Pass, even though the pass clearly said entrance to the museum was included the person on the gate wanted 9 euro more to let me in. When I showed my pass and asked for an explanation as to why they wanted more money and why",
          "The museum has extensive exhibits about the history of Maritime in Genova, some of which are interactive. Excellent and interesting. Make sure you tour the submarine too!",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Podest\u00e0 (pronounced [pode\u02c8sta], English: Potestate, Podesta) is the name given to certain high officials in many Italian cities beginning in the later Middle Ages. Mainly it meant the chief magistrate of a city state, the counterpart to similar positions in other cities that went by other names, e.g. rettori (\"rectors\"), but it could also mean the local administrator, who was the representative of the Holy Roman Emperor. Currently, Podest\u00e0 is the title of mayors in Italian-speaking municipalities of Graub\u00fcnden in Switzerland.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe term derives from the Latin word potestas, meaning power. There is a similar derivation for the Arabic term Sultan: originally meaning \"power\" or \"authority\", it eventually became the title of the person holding power.\n\n\n== Italian history ==\nThe first documented usage of podest\u00e0 was in Bologna in 1151, when it was applied to Guido di Ranieri di Sasso of Canossa, brought in from Faenza to be rettore e podest\u00e0, noted in numerous documents. Leander Albertus gives the particulars:\n\n\"The citizens, seeing that there often arose among them quarrels and altercations, whether from favoritism or friendship, from envy or hatred that one had against another, by which their republic suffered great harm, loss and detriment; therefore, they decided, after much deliberation, to provide against these disorders. And thus they began to create a man of foreign birth their chief magistrate, giving him every power, authority and jurisdiction over the city, as well over criminal as over civil causes, and in times of war as well as in times of peace, calling him praetor as being above the others, or podest\u00e0., as having every authority and power over the city.\"\n\nPodests were first more widely appointed by the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa when he began to assert the rights that his Imperial position gave him over the cities of northern Italy; at the second imperial diet at Roncaglia, November 1158, Frederick appointed in several major cities imperial podest\u00e0 \"as if having imperial power in that place\" The elected consuls, which Frederick had claimed the right to ratify, he began to designate directly. The business of the podest\u00e0 was to enforce imperial rights. From the start, this was very unpopular, and their often arbitrary behaviour was a factor in bringing about the formation of the Lombard League and the uprising against Frederick in 1167.\nAlthough the Emperor's experiment was short-lived, the podest\u00e0 soon became important and common in northern Italy, making their appearance in most communes around the year 1200, with an essential difference. These officials were now appointed by the citizens or by the citizens' representatives, rather like the older consuls (but not collegial). The podest\u00e0 exercised the supreme power in the city, both in peace and war, and in foreign and domestic matters alike; but their term of office lasted only about a year.In order to avoid the intense strife so common in Italian civic life, it soon became the custom to hire a stranger to fill this position. Venetians were in special demand for this purpose during the 12th and 13th centuries. This was probably due to their lesser concern (at the time) than other Italians in the affairs of the mainland. Afterwards, in a few cases, the term of office was extended to cover a period of years, or even a lifetime. They were confined in a luxury palace to keep them from being influenced by any of the local families. The architectural arrangement of the Palazzo Pubblico at Siena, built starting in 1297, evokes the uneasy relation of the commune with the podest\u00e0, who in Siena's case was a disinterested nobleman at the head of the judiciary. It provided a self-contained lodging round its own interior court for the podest\u00e0, separate but housed within the Palazzo Pubblico where the councillors and their committee of nine habitually met.During the later part of the twelfth and the whole of the thirteenth century most Italian cities were governed by a podest\u00e0. Concerning Rome, with a history of civic violence, Gregorovius says that \"in 1205 the Pope Innocent III changed the form of the civic government; the executive power lying henceforward in the hand of a single senator or podest, who, directly or indirectly, was appointed by the pope\". In Florence after 1180, the chief authority was transferred from the consuls to the podest, and Milan and other cities were also ruled by these officials. There were, moreover, podests in some of the cities of the adjoining Provence in southeastern France.An anonymous writer composed a short guide for the would-be podest\u00e0 (although it would be unseemly to appear openly to run for the office), Oculus pastoralis, of about 1222; in six simple and brief chapters it guides the novice through the requirements of the office, the salary, the address of welcome given by the retiring podest\u00e0 to the new one, the choice of counsellors, the handling of money accounts. The fifth chapter offers some model speeches on public occasions, such as the death of prominent citizens. A final chapter touches upon making war (in a paragraph), and the training of urban officials.\nIn the thirteenth century in Florence, in Orvieto (1251) and some other cities a capitano del popolo (literally, \"captain of the people\") was chosen to look after the interests of the lower classes. (To this day, the heads of government of the little independent republic of San Marino are still called \"capitani\".) In other ways the power of the podests was reduced\u2014they were confined more and more to judicial functions until they disappeared early in the sixteenth century.The officials sent by the Italian republics to administer the affairs of dependent cities were also sometimes called podests. Into the 20th century the cities of Trento and Trieste gave the name of podest to their chief magistrate.The example of Italy in the matter of podests was sometimes followed by cities and republics in northern Europe in the Middle Ages, notably by such as had trade relations with Italy. The officers elected sometimes bore the title of podesta or podestat. Thus in East Frisia there were podests identical in name and functions with those of the Italian republics; sometimes each province had one, sometimes the federal diet elected a podest-general for the whole country, the term of office being for a limited period or for life.\n\n\n=== Fascist era ===\nThe Fascist regime created its own version of the podest\u00e0 figure. In February 1926, Mussolini's Senate issued a decree which abolished the autonomous powers and functions of comunes (municipalities), including elected town councils and mayors. Instead, all comunes except for Rome were to be headed by a  \"podest\u00e0\", an authoritarian mayor with full executive and legislative powers. He was appointed by royal charter (in practice, by the National Fascist Party) for a renewable five-year term (which could be revoked at any time with immediate effect). In Rome, a governor was appointed to head the local government. In larger communes, the podest\u00e0 was assisted by one or two vice-podest\u00e0 nominated by the Ministry of Interior, in addition to a board of advisors (consulta municipale) nominated either by the local prefect or, in the major cities, by the Ministry of Interior.\nThe decree was in effect from 21 April 1927 until 1945, when the entire system was abandoned with the return to democracy.\n\n\n== Podesteria ==\nLiterally this derived word means the office of a podest\u00e0 or its term, but Podesteria can also designate a district administered by a podest\u00e0 within a larger state.\nIn the domini di Terraferma that the dogal republic of Venice gradually established in the basin of the river Po, annexing various former principalities and self-governing cities, mostly in the fifteenth century, podesterias (ven. podestarie) were one of the intermediate levels of the hierarchical administrative organization, the highest ('provincial') level being the territorio (roughly a modern administrative region).\nAfter the other dogal republic, Genoa, was in 1273 granted control of Pera and Galata, commercial suburbs of Constantinople, by the Byzantine emperor, it governed them jointly by a common podest\u00e0 until 1453, when all Constantinople was conquered by the Ottoman Turks.\n\n\n== Frisian potestaat ==\nThe concept of a local man empowered to represent the Emperor was also a feature of medieval Frisia. From apocryphal beginnings, important rights were granted or confirmed under the code of law known as the Lex Frisionum. According to later tradition, it was Charlemagne who granted the Frisians the title of freemen and permitted them to choose their own podestat or imperial governor from among the chieftains, to organize and lead the defense of two of the three districts of Frisia, in Middle Frisia, from the Flie to the Lauwers and in East Frisia from the Lauwers to the Weser, later the Countship of Ostfriesland.\nThe Italians probably became aware of the Frisian Potestaat, in Dutch \"op poten staan\" in English 'on legs standing', like for instance king Henry on his painting (Dutch: potestaat, German: Potestat, English: potestate) during the Sixth Crusade in 1228. According to privileges that were falsely ascribed to the Carolingian era, the potestate was chosen by council and he must be able to slay knights. Apocryphal historical writings mention the potestate as early as the Viking Age.\nThe only potestates chosen to lead Friesland between the Vlie and Lauwers were Juw Juwinga (1396) and Juw Dekema (1494), both were chosen by the Schieringers. However, in 1399 the districts of Westergo and Oostergo elected potestates, Haring Harinxma and Sjoerd Wiarda respectively, in the struggle against the count of Holland. The title became well known outside of Friesland only with the installation of Albrecht of Saxony as hereditary potestate in 1498; the Frisians chose Jancko Douwama as their imperial stadtholder (1522).\n\n\n=== Partial list of legendary and historical potestates ===\nMagnus Forteman (809), legendary\nTaco Ludigman (819), legendary\nAdelbrik Adelen (830), legendary\nHessel Hermana (869), legendary\nIgo Galema (886), legendary\nGosse Ludigman (989), legendary\nSaco Reinalda (1167), legendary\nSicko Sjaerdema (1237)\nReinder Cammingha (1306)\nHessel Martena (voor 1313)\nJuw Juwinga (1396)\nSytse Dekama, Gale Hania and Odo Botnia (1399)\nSjoerd Wiarda and Haring Harinxma (1404)\nJuw Dekama (1494)\n\n\n== See also ==\nCapitano del popolo\nCapitano reggente\nGonfaloniere\nPodest\u00e0 of Constantinople\n\n\n== Reading ==\nBrouwer, J.H., J.J.

        "wiki": "Sturla (St\u00fbrl\u00e2 in Ligurian) is a quartiere of Genoa. It began life as an ancient fishing village which developed around a number of small coves - Sturla a Mare, at the mouth of the Sturla river, Vernazzola and Boccadasse (Boccadasse is now included in the neighbouring quartiere of Albaro). Sturla is located in Golfo di Sturla (Sturla Bay).\nSturla is part of the Medio Levante municipality, and has a population of 8278 inhabitants (as of December 31, 2010).\nIn the 1800s the current quartiere was a commune of San Martino d'Albaro, while the village of Vernazzola was a commune of San Francesco d'Albaro. However, both communes were annexed by Genoa in 1874.\n\n\n== Description of the quartiere ==\n\nThe area of Sturla is marked out by Corso Europa, Via Orsini, the right bank of the Sturla river (from which it takes its name) and the sea. During the 20th century the neighborhood went through a period of extensive construction, but the centers of the original ancient villages are still recognizable. The neighbouring quarters are Albaro to the west, Borgoratti and San Martino to the north and Quarto dei Mille to the east.\nThe neighbourhood is home to the Villa Gentile athletics arena, as well as several public and private bathing facilities. A water purification plant has been built between Sturla beach and Vernazzola beach.\nThere are several schools in the district. There's a nursery school (Nini Corsanego) as well as a kindergarten (Bartolomeo Chighizola), both on the road leading from Piazza Sturla to Vernazzola beach. There's also a primary school dedicated to Ettore Vernazza, a middle school (Bernardo Strozzi) and the Martin Luther King high school that focuses on the sciences and was built in the 1960s.\nThe Genoese poet, Vico Faggi dedicated the following verse to Sturla:\n\nUna luce, un riflesso. Quel barbaglioti fulmina, dal vetro, e tutto il borgosi ridesta, s\u2019arruffa. [...]\n\n\n== The maritime villages of Sturla ==\nIn the area of Sturla, starting from the early Middle Ages, several maritime settlements arose due to the presence of useful landing places.\n\n\n=== Sturla a Mare ===\nTo the East of Vernazzola, separated by the small hill between the Vernazza river and the Sturla river, is the historic core of Sturla, a tiny fishing village, as evidenced by some of the place names, which winds around Via del Tritone, Via Tabarca, Via Zoagli, Vico del Pesce and Via del Bragone.\nToday the village, partly reduced in size by the opening immediately upstream of an enlarged road (Via Dei Mille), consists of a few houses clustered around the ancient Oratorio di San Celso, the existence of which has been documented since 1311 although it was rebuilt in the Baroque period and then completely rebuilt in 2002.\n\n\n=== Vernazzola ===\n\nVernazzola is a picturesque fishing village at the mouth of the Vernazza river located a short distance to the east of Boccadasse. The bay in which the village is located is hemmed in by two rocky outcrops named Grosso and Bernardina. The view extends to the east to the Portofino peninsular.\nAs well as being a fishing village, in the past Vernazzola was an important landing ground from where it was possible to climb the Sturla valley, on through the quartiere of Bavari and into the upper Bisagno valley. Immediately behind the houses on the shoreline there once stood a Dominican convent with an adjoining hospital for travellers. In time, behind the coastal buildings there gradually arose grand villas of the aristocratic families of Genoa, and finally, in the early twentieth century, luxurious Art Nouveau villas. However, like Boccadasse, the village still preserves its ancient dwellings, the network of old streets and an atmosphere of a bygone era.\nSome of the streets around Vernazzola have characteristic names inspired by ancient classical mythology: Argonauti, Giasone, Icarus, Pelio, Urania. These names were chosen at the request of the last mayor of San Francesco d'Albaro, a passionate lover of the classical world, shortly before the annexation of the town to Genoa, in the second half of the 18th Century.\nAlong the road that leads around Capo di Santa Chiara, a distinctive vantage point dominated by the medieval styled Turcke castle, there are some eighteenth-century villas, the Augustinian convent and the church of Santa Chiara, founded in the sixteenth century.\n\n\n=== Boccadasse ===\n\nBoccadasse is located immediately to the west of Capo di Santa Chiara. Although it\u2019s part of the district of Albaro it can be considered the last of the small fishing villages of the area of Sturla.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Sturla river and Vernazza river ==\n\nSturla is bisected by the Sturla river. The river is ten kilometers long and rarely dry. It starts in the districts of San Desidario and Bavari where it runs through a narrow valley between the slopes of Monte Fasce and Monte Ratti, then coming to the area of Borgoratti. On the way it collects the waters of tributaries such as the Pom\u00e0 river, the Can\u00e8 river, the Penego river and other smaller streams.\nAnother stream in the area is the Vernazza river, now completely channeled into tunnels, which flows from the area of the ancient Roman road, Via Aurelia, which is also known as Vernazza, in the district of San Martino, through the small valley containing the Martin Luther King high school, passes under Piazza Sturla and finally flows into the sea in an outlet in Vernazzola.\n\n\n== Sturla beach ==\nConsidered by many to be the finest beach in Genoa, Sturla beach spreads out to either side of the mouth of the Sturla river. One of the first free beaches heading east from the city center it attracts vast numbers of people all through the summer months. Many people also come for the many bars and restaurants that open directly onto the beach.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\n\n=== Church of the Santissima Annunziata ===\n\nThe church of the Santissima Annunziata, in a dominant position over Piazza Sturla was built between 1434 and 1435 and is now the home of the parish church of the Deanery of Albaro in the Archdiocese of Genoa.\nThe church was built at the behest of two priests, Pietro Micichero and Domenico Verrucca, who had founded a congregation of secular canons. From 1441 it was officiated by the Canonici di San Giorgio in Alga, popularly called \"Celestini\", who remained there until 1668 when the congregation was dissolved by Pope Clement IX. It then passed on to the Order of Saint Augustine, who had to leave in 1797 due to Napoleonic laws which suppressed religious orders. It was then entrusted to secular clergy, becoming a branch of San Martino d'Albaro. It underwent several renovations and expansions, and became a parish in its own right in 1894. In the 1940s the church underwent a major restoration, which involved almost a total renovation of the building.\nThis reconstruction virtually erased the various reconstructions of the Baroque era to bring the building, at least in its essential structure, back to its original fifteenth-century form, although the restoration was undertaken in an interpretive and not scientifically rigorous fashion.\nThe church has three naves, each complete with its own semi-circular apse. The side naves are separated from the central by four columns on each side connected by semicircular arches.\nThe facade was built freely reinterpreting the original style, with two monofora windows (narrow windows with an arched top and single opening), a central rose window and the original slate architrave above the entrance.\nIt contains notable works of art from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, including a Madonna and Child and Saint Sebastian and Saint Roch (San Rocco). They\u2019re of the Venetian school of the sixteenth century. There is also a Madonna and Child and Saint Anthony by Gregorio De Ferrari (1690) and a sixteenth-century fresco, again depicting Saint Sebastian and Saint Roch.\n\n\n=== Oratorio di San Celso ===\nThe church of San Celso, the first religious building built in Sturla, located in Vico del Pesce, not far from the mouth of Sturla river, is now the oratory of the Disciplinati di Sturla, under the title of Saint Roch. It was built in the fourteenth century (the first records date back to 1311), restored in 1391 and completely rebuilt in 1594. In 2002 it was completely restored. Already an independent parish, in 1406 it became subordinate to San Martino d'Albaro, under the patronage of the Spinola family. It later became the oratory of the brotherhood named Santi Rocco e Nazario e Celso.\nThere are remarkable preserved frescoes painted between the fourteenth and the seventeenth century, while other works of art, including the altarpiece depicting the Saints Roch, Nazarius and Celsus, Catherine of Siena and Saint Sebastian, by Bernardo Castello, were transferred to the parish church of the Santissima Annunziata.\n\n\n=== Oratorio di S. Giovanni Battista e monastero delle Battistine ===\nIn Sturla you\u2019ll also find the convent of Sisterhood of St. John the Baptist, a religious order of women founded in the mid-eighteenth century by Giovanna Maria Battista Solimani. The nuns moved here in 1924 from their original location in the centre of Genoa, in the street still called \"Salita delle Battistine\u201d. Next to the convent is a church dedicated to St. John the Baptist, consecrated on 18 June 1960, containing the tomb of the founder.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe historical events of Sturla are closely tied to those of Genoa. Until the start of the 20th century, the area, like the other two municipalities to which it belonged (San Francesco d'Albaro and San Martino d'Albaro), was made up of small settlements of farmers and fishermen, away from the main communication routes of the time.\nThe oldest historical references regarding the area of Sturla refer to the frequent fights between Guelphs and Ghibellines that bloodied Genoa in the Middle Ages. There were also reports of clashes between the Grillo and Vento family in 1179.\nIn 1284, Oberto Doria, Captain of the People and Admiral of the Republic of Genoa, during the war against Pisa, which culminated on August 6 in the same year as the battle of Meloria, deployed his ships in front of the Sturla beach, waiting for the events to unfold.\nOn 26 November 1322 the Guelphs attacked the castle of Sturla, containing the garrison of the Ghibellines, which controlled the Bisagno valley. After two days the besiegers, who also possessed a trebuchet, pummeled the castle walls with stones, fatally weakening them, and the castle constructed by Antonio Doria was forced to surrender.\nIn 1363, during a banquet given by the nobleman Pietro Malocello in honor of Peter I, King of Cyprus, visiting Genoa, the Doge, Simone Boccanegra was mysteriously poisoned.\nSturla was once famous for its zavorristi, the men who loaded and unloaded the ballast required by sailing ships to maintain the right balance out at sea.\n\n\n== Infrastructure and transport ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nInitially Via Aurelia, which was used from the Middle Ages until the Napoleonic era, avoided the sea, passing along Via Antica Romana di Quarto, over Ponte Vecchio di Sturla (a medieval bridge with two arches) and along the streets of Casette, Pontetti and Vernazza. With the road revolution in the nineteenth-century a main road opened up between Genoa, Albaro and Sturla. It was a continuation towards Genoa of the new coastal Via Aurelia, which in 1808 had reached Nervi from Levante. The new road, perpendicular to the ancient creuze (little streets that lead down toward the sea), put an end to the isolation of the city from Levante, reaching Piazza Sturla, heading towards San Martino and then on to Genoa. In the twentieth century more roads were built, starting from Piazza Sturla, that more directly linked Sturla to the centre of Genoa.\nPiazza Sturla was more recently enlarged with a viaduct that leads from Via Caprera over the valley of the Vernazza river. Small secluded ancient fishing settlements still remain amongst this sea of modern roads.\nFrom Piazza Sturla, Via Sturla and Via Isonzo lead to Corso Europa, a road built in the sixties, linking the neighbourhoods to the east of Genoa to the city centre.\nThe nearest motorway exit is Genoa-Nervi, on the A12, 4 miles from Sturla.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\nSturla has a railway station on the Genoa \u2013 Pisa line, in which only regional trains stop. It\u2019s used for connections to the other parts of city and the coastal towns Levante Riviera.\n\n\n== Environment ==\nIn Sturla there is a Site of Community Importance, as was proposed by the Natura 2000 network of Liguria, for its particular nature and geology. The site is located between Boccadasse, Sturla, Quarto dei Mille, Quinto al Mare and Nervi. It has a very particular habitat formed by Posidonia oceanica (commonly known as Neptune Grass or Mediterranean Tapeweed) and coral formations. Among the animal species are the following fish: tentacled blenny, tompot blenny, seahorse, gray wrasse, brown wrasse, pointed-snout wrasse, east Atlantic peacock wrasse.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nSturla had one of the most famous groups of singers of Genovese trallalero folk music. The \u201cCanterini Vecchia Sturla\u201d were formed in 1926 but no longer exists.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nLa Sportiva Sturla, founded in 1920, is active in water sports (swimming and especially water polo in which they won the championship in 1923, breaking for a single year, a string of successes of their rivals, Andrea Doria, which lasted for twenty years). In more recent times, the water polo team, having missed out on promotion to the A1 league in the early nineties, currently plays in Serie B.\nLa Sportiva Sturla has organized since 1969 the \"Memorial Morena\", an international youth swimming meet, which is held every two years, and the \"Miglio Marino di Sturla\" swimming competition in the open sea, which has taken place since 1913, which over the years has seen amongst its competitors swimmers of an international standard. Among these we can mention in the men's Mattia Alberico and Marco Formentini, and in the ladies Paola Cavallino and Giorgia Consiglio (the women's race has been held since 1986).\nThe ASD Urania di Vernazzola, established in 1926, is active in rowing and sport fishing.\nThe Circolo Nautico Sturla, founded in 1981 by some sturlesi is active in sailing, and pesca subacquea (fishing while scuba diving). The CNS is now one of the few clubs in Liguria to be awarded a title of Italian champion teams \"Fishing SUB second category\" (1997), and its athlete, Diego Romero, earned a bronze medal in the Laser class at the Beijing Olympics in 2008.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Sturla (St\u00fbrl\u00e2 in Ligurian) is a quartiere of Genoa. It began life as an ancient fishing village which developed around a number of small coves - Sturla a Mare, at the mouth of the Sturla river, Vernazzola and Boccadasse (Boccadasse is now included in the neighbouring quartiere of Albaro). Sturla is located in Golfo di Sturla (Sturla Bay).\nSturla is part of the Medio Levante municipality, and has a population of 8278 inhabitants (as of December 31, 2010).\nIn the 1800s the current quartiere was a commune of San Martino d'Albaro, while the village of Vernazzola was a commune of San Francesco d'Albaro. However, both communes were annexed by Genoa in 1874.\n\n\n== Description of the quartiere ==\n\nThe area of Sturla is marked out by Corso Europa, Via Orsini, the right bank of the Sturla river (from which it takes its name) and the sea. During the 20th century the neighborhood went through a period of extensive construction, but the centers of the original ancient villages are still recognizable. The neighbouring quarters are Albaro to the west, Borgoratti and San Martino to the north and Quarto dei Mille to the east.\nThe neighbourhood is home to the Villa Gentile athletics arena, as well as several public and private bathing facilities. A water purification plant has been built between Sturla beach and Vernazzola beach.\nThere are several schools in the district. There's a nursery school (Nini Corsanego) as well as a kindergarten (Bartolomeo Chighizola), both on the road leading from Piazza Sturla to Vernazzola beach. There's also a primary school dedicated to Ettore Vernazza, a middle school (Bernardo Strozzi) and the Martin Luther King high school that focuses on the sciences and was built in the 1960s.\nThe Genoese poet, Vico Faggi dedicated the following verse to Sturla:\n\nUna luce, un riflesso. Quel barbaglioti fulmina, dal vetro, e tutto il borgosi ridesta, s\u2019arruffa. [...]\n\n\n== The maritime villages of Sturla ==\nIn the area of Sturla, starting from the early Middle Ages, several maritime settlements arose due to the presence of useful landing places.\n\n\n=== Sturla a Mare ===\nTo the East of Vernazzola, separated by the small hill between the Vernazza river and the Sturla river, is the historic core of Sturla, a tiny fishing village, as evidenced by some of the place names, which winds around Via del Tritone, Via Tabarca, Via Zoagli, Vico del Pesce and Via del Bragone.\nToday the village, partly reduced in size by the opening immediately upstream of an enlarged road (Via Dei Mille), consists of a few houses clustered around the ancient Oratorio di San Celso, the existence of which has been documented since 1311 although it was rebuilt in the Baroque period and then completely rebuilt in 2002.\n\n\n=== Vernazzola ===\n\nVernazzola is a picturesque fishing village at the mouth of the Vernazza river located a short distance to the east of Boccadasse. The bay in which the village is located is hemmed in by two rocky outcrops named Grosso and Bernardina. The view extends to the east to the Portofino peninsular.\nAs well as being a fishing village, in the past Vernazzola was an important landing ground from where it was possible to climb the Sturla valley, on through the quartiere of Bavari and into the upper Bisagno valley. Immediately behind the houses on the shoreline there once stood a Dominican convent with an adjoining hospital for travellers. In time, behind the coastal buildings there gradually arose grand villas of the aristocratic families of Genoa, and finally, in the early twentieth century, luxurious Art Nouveau villas. However, like Boccadasse, the village still preserves its ancient dwellings, the network of old streets and an atmosphere of a bygone era.\nSome of the streets around Vernazzola have characteristic names inspired by ancient classical mythology: Argonauti, Giasone, Icarus, Pelio, Urania. These names were chosen at the request of the last mayor of San Francesco d'Albaro, a passionate lover of the classical world, shortly before the annexation of the town to Genoa, in the second half of the 18th Century.\nAlong the road that leads around Capo di Santa Chiara, a distinctive vantage point dominated by the medieval styled Turcke castle, there are some eighteenth-century villas, the Augustinian convent and the church of Santa Chiara, founded in the sixteenth century.\n\n\n=== Boccadasse ===\n\nBoccadasse is located immediately to the west of Capo di Santa Chiara. Although it\u2019s part of the district of Albaro it can be considered the last of the small fishing villages of the area of Sturla.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Sturla river and Vernazza river ==\n\nSturla is bisected by the Sturla river. The river is ten kilometers long and rarely dry. It starts in the districts of San Desidario and Bavari where it runs through a narrow valley between the slopes of Monte Fasce and Monte Ratti, then coming to the area of Borgoratti. On the way it collects the waters of tributaries such as the Pom\u00e0 river, the Can\u00e8 river, the Penego river and other smaller streams.\nAnother stream in the area is the Vernazza river, now completely channeled into tunnels, which flows from the area of the ancient Roman road, Via Aurelia, which is also known as Vernazza, in the district of San Martino, through the small valley containing the Martin Luther King high school, passes under Piazza Sturla and finally flows into the sea in an outlet in Vernazzola.\n\n\n== Sturla beach ==\nConsidered by many to be the finest beach in Genoa, Sturla beach spreads out to either side of the mouth of the Sturla river. One of the first free beaches heading east from the city center it attracts vast numbers of people all through the summer months. Many people also come for the many bars and restaurants that open directly onto the beach.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\n\n=== Church of the Santissima Annunziata ===\n\nThe church of the Santissima Annunziata, in a dominant position over Piazza Sturla was built between 1434 and 1435 and is now the home of the parish church of the Deanery of Albaro in the Archdiocese of Genoa.\nThe church was built at the behest of two priests, Pietro Micichero and Domenico Verrucca, who had founded a congregation of secular canons. From 1441 it was officiated by the Canonici di San Giorgio in Alga, popularly called \"Celestini\", who remained there until 1668 when the congregation was dissolved by Pope Clement IX. It then passed on to the Order of Saint Augustine, who had to leave in 1797 due to Napoleonic laws which suppressed religious orders. It was then entrusted to secular clergy, becoming a branch of San Martino d'Albaro. It underwent several renovations and expansions, and became a parish in its own right in 1894. In the 1940s the church underwent a major restoration, which involved almost a total renovation of the building.\nThis reconstruction virtually erased the various reconstructions of the Baroque era to bring the building, at least in its essential structure, back to its original fifteenth-century form, although the restoration was undertaken in an interpretive and not scientifically rigorous fashion.\nThe church has three naves, each complete with its own semi-circular apse. The side naves are separated from the central by four columns on each side connected by semicircular arches.\nThe facade was built freely reinterpreting the original style, with two monofora windows (narrow windows with an arched top and single opening), a central rose window and the original slate architrave above the entrance.\nIt contains notable works of art from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, including a Madonna and Child and Saint Sebastian and Saint Roch (San Rocco). They\u2019re of the Venetian school of the sixteenth century. There is also a Madonna and Child and Saint Anthony by Gregorio De Ferrari (1690) and a sixteenth-century fresco, again depicting Saint Sebastian and Saint Roch.\n\n\n=== Oratorio di San Celso ===\nThe church of San Celso, the first religious building built in Sturla, located in Vico del Pesce, not far from the mouth of Sturla river, is now the oratory of the Disciplinati di Sturla, under the title of Saint Roch. It was built in the fourteenth century (the first records date back to 1311), restored in 1391 and completely rebuilt in 1594. In 2002 it was completely restored. Already an independent parish, in 1406 it became subordinate to San Martino d'Albaro, under the patronage of the Spinola family. It later became the oratory of the brotherhood named Santi Rocco e Nazario e Celso.\nThere are remarkable preserved frescoes painted between the fourteenth and the seventeenth century, while other works of art, including the altarpiece depicting the Saints Roch, Nazarius and Celsus, Catherine of Siena and Saint Sebastian, by Bernardo Castello, were transferred to the parish church of the Santissima Annunziata.\n\n\n=== Oratorio di S. Giovanni Battista e monastero delle Battistine ===\nIn Sturla you\u2019ll also find the convent of Sisterhood of St. John the Baptist, a religious order of women founded in the mid-eighteenth century by Giovanna Maria Battista Solimani. The nuns moved here in 1924 from their original location in the centre of Genoa, in the street still called \"Salita delle Battistine\u201d. Next to the convent is a church dedicated to St. John the Baptist, consecrated on 18 June 1960, containing the tomb of the founder.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe historical events of Sturla are closely tied to those of Genoa. Until the start of the 20th century, the area, like the other two municipalities to which it belonged (San Francesco d'Albaro and San Martino d'Albaro), was made up of small settlements of farmers and fishermen, away from the main communication routes of the time.\nThe oldest historical references regarding the area of Sturla refer to the frequent fights between Guelphs and Ghibellines that bloodied Genoa in the Middle Ages. There were also reports of clashes between the Grillo and Vento family in 1179.\nIn 1284, Oberto Doria, Captain of the People and Admiral of the Republic of Genoa, during the war against Pisa, which culminated on August 6 in the same year as the battle of Meloria, deployed his ships in front of the Sturla beach, waiting for the events to unfold.\nOn 26 November 1322 the Guelphs attacked the castle of Sturla, containing the garrison of the Ghibellines, which controlled the Bisagno valley. After two days the besiegers, who also possessed a trebuchet, pummeled the castle walls with stones, fatally weakening them, and the castle constructed by Antonio Doria was forced to surrender.\nIn 1363, during a banquet given by the nobleman Pietro Malocello in honor of Peter I, King of Cyprus, visiting Genoa, the Doge, Simone Boccanegra was mysteriously poisoned.\nSturla was once famous for its zavorristi, the men who loaded and unloaded the ballast required by sailing ships to maintain the right balance out at sea.\n\n\n== Infrastructure and transport ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nInitially Via Aurelia, which was used from the Middle Ages until the Napoleonic era, avoided the sea, passing along Via Antica Romana di Quarto, over Ponte Vecchio di Sturla (a medieval bridge with two arches) and along the streets of Casette, Pontetti and Vernazza. With the road revolution in the nineteenth-century a main road opened up between Genoa, Albaro and Sturla. It was a continuation towards Genoa of the new coastal Via Aurelia, which in 1808 had reached Nervi from Levante. The new road, perpendicular to the ancient creuze (little streets that lead down toward the sea), put an end to the isolation of the city from Levante, reaching Piazza Sturla, heading towards San Martino and then on to Genoa. In the twentieth century more roads were built, starting from Piazza Sturla, that more directly linked Sturla to the centre of Genoa.\nPiazza Sturla was more recently enlarged with a viaduct that leads from Via Caprera over the valley of the Vernazza river. Small secluded ancient fishing settlements still remain amongst this sea of modern roads.\nFrom Piazza Sturla, Via Sturla and Via Isonzo lead to Corso Europa, a road built in the sixties, linking the neighbourhoods to the east of Genoa to the city centre.\nThe nearest motorway exit is Genoa-Nervi, on the A12, 4 miles from Sturla.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\nSturla has a railway station on the Genoa \u2013 Pisa line, in which only regional trains stop. It\u2019s used for connections to the other parts of city and the coastal towns Levante Riviera.\n\n\n== Environment ==\nIn Sturla there is a Site of Community Importance, as was proposed by the Natura 2000 network of Liguria, for its particular nature and geology. The site is located between Boccadasse, Sturla, Quarto dei Mille, Quinto al Mare and Nervi. It has a very particular habitat formed by Posidonia oceanica (commonly known as Neptune Grass or Mediterranean Tapeweed) and coral formations. Among the animal species are the following fish: tentacled blenny, tompot blenny, seahorse, gray wrasse, brown wrasse, pointed-snout wrasse, east Atlantic peacock wrasse.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nSturla had one of the most famous groups of singers of Genovese trallalero folk music. The \u201cCanterini Vecchia Sturla\u201d were formed in 1926 but no longer exists.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nLa Sportiva Sturla, founded in 1920, is active in water sports (swimming and especially water polo in which they won the championship in 1923, breaking for a single year, a string of successes of their rivals, Andrea Doria, which lasted for twenty years). In more recent times, the water polo team, having missed out on promotion to the A1 league in the early nineties, currently plays in Serie B.\nLa Sportiva Sturla has organized since 1969 the \"Memorial Morena\", an international youth swimming meet, which is held every two years, and the \"Miglio Marino di Sturla\" swimming competition in the open sea, which has taken place since 1913, which over the years has seen amongst its competitors swimmers of an international standard. Among these we can mention in the men's Mattia Alberico and Marco Formentini, and in the ladies Paola Cavallino and Giorgia Consiglio (the women's race has been held since 1986).\nThe ASD Urania di Vernazzola, established in 1926, is active in rowing and sport fishing.\nThe Circolo Nautico Sturla, founded in 1981 by some sturlesi is active in sailing, and pesca subacquea (fishing while scuba diving). The CNS is now one of the few clubs in Liguria to be awarded a title of Italian champion teams \"Fishing SUB second category\" (1997), and its athlete, Diego Romero, earned a bronze medal in the Laser class at the Beijing Olympics in 2008.\n\n\n== References ==",

In 2015, 594,733 people lived within the city's administrative limits. As of the 2011 Italian census, the Province of Genoa, which in 2015 became the Metropolitan City of Genoa, counted 855,834 resident persons. Over 1.5 million people live in the wider metropolitan area stretching along the Italian Riviera.Located on the Gulf of Genoa in the Ligurian Sea, Genoa has historically been one of the most important ports on the Mediterranean: it is currently the busiest in Italy and in the Mediterranean Sea and twelfth-busiest in the European Union. Genoa has been nicknamed la Superba (\"the proud one\") due to its glorious past and impressive landmarks. Part of the old town of Genoa was inscribed on the World Heritage List (UNESCO) in 2006 as Genoa: Le Strade Nuove and the system of the Palazzi dei Rolli. The city's rich cultural history in art, music and cuisine allowed it to become the 2004 European Capital of Culture. It is the birthplace of Guglielmo Embriaco, Christopher Columbus, Andrea Doria, Niccol\u00f2 Paganini, Giuseppe Mazzini, Renzo Piano and Grimaldo Canella, founder of the House of Grimaldi, among others.\nGenoa, which forms the southern corner of the Milan-Turin-Genoa industrial triangle of Northwest Italy, is one of the country's major economic centers. The city has hosted massive shipyards and steelworks since the 19th century, and its solid financial sector dates back to the Middle Ages. The Bank of Saint George, founded in 1407, is among the oldest in the world and has played an important role in the city's prosperity since the middle of the 15th century. A number of leading Italian companies are based in the city, including Fincantieri, Selex ES, Ansaldo Energia, Ansaldo STS, Edoardo Raffinerie Garrone, Piaggio Aerospace, Mediterranean Shipping Company and Costa Cruises.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe city's modern name may derive from the Latin word meaning \"knee\" (genu; plural, genua) but there are other theories. It could derive from the god Janus, because Genoa, like him, has two faces: a face that looks at the sea and another turned to the mountains. Or it could come from the Latin word ianua, also related to the name of the God Janus, and meaning \"door\" or \"passage.\" Besides that, it may refer to its geographical position at the centre of the Ligurian coastal arch. The Latin name, oppidum Genua, is recorded by Pliny the Elder (Nat. Hist. 3.48) as part of the Augustean Regio IX Liguria.Another theory traces the name to the Etruscan word Kainua which means \"New City\", based on an inscription on a pottery sherd reading Kainua, suggests that the Latin name may be a corruption of an older Etruscan one with an original meaning of \"new town\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Genoa area has been inhabited since the fifth or fourth millennium BC. In the 5th century BC the first town, or oppidum, was founded at the top of the hill today called Castello (Castle), which is now inside the medieval old town. Among the ancient inhabitants of the region were the Ligures, that gave the name to the modern Liguria. \nGenoa is a port city by birth, establishing itself as the merchant capital of the newly established Republic of Genoa in 1005 and maintaining its independence until 1797. Throughout its existence the Republic had different forms of government, the most notable of these was the Dogate, that in actuality, was an oligarchy ruled by a group of wealthy merchant families, from whom the doges were selected.\nDuring the Late Middle Ages Genoa was one of the main commercial powers of the Mediterranean Sea, while between the 16th and 17th centuries it was one of the major financial centers in Europe.The earliest known state deposit bank, Banco di San Giorgio (Bank of St. George), was founded in 1407 at Genoa.\nThe fleet's participation in the Crusades allowed Genoa to further establish prosperous trading colonies, in fact, throughout its history, the Republic extended its direct domain in numerous territories, including Corsica, Cyprus, Tabarka, Chios and Southern Crimea.Thereafter, Genovese bankers, financed many of the Spanish crown's foreign endeavors. Fernand Braudel has even called the period 1557 to 1627 the \"age of the Genovese\", \"of a rule that was so discreet and sophisticated that historians for a long time failed to notice it\".However, since the 16th century, Genoa began to lose almost all of its colonies across the Mediterranean, and the influence of the once powerful republic began to decline.It was 1796 that the Republic of Genoa finally ended, replaced by Napoleonic ruled Ligurian Republic. Since 1815 after the \"Congresso di Vienna\" Genoa was annexed to the Regno di Sardegna (Sardinia Kingdom). Italian unification of 1861 resulted in Genoa becoming the maritime hub of the new Italian state.\n\n\n=== Flag ===\n\nThe flag of Genoa is a St. George's Cross, a red cross on a white field.\nThe patron saint of Genoa was Saint Lawrence until at least 958, but the Genoese transferred their allegiance to Saint George (and Saint John the Baptist) at some point during the 11th or 12th century, most likely with the rising popularity of the military saint during the Crusades. Genoa also had a banner displaying a cross since at latest 1218, possibly as early as 1113. But the cross banner was not associated with the saint; indeed, the saint had his own flag, the vexillum beati Georgii (first mentioned 1198), a red flag showing George and the dragon. A depiction of this flag is shown in the Genoese annals under the year 1227. The Genoese flag with the red cross was used alongside this \"Saint George's flag\", from at least 1218, known as the insignia cruxata comunis Janue (\"cross ensign of the commune of Genoa\"). \nThe saint's flag was the city's main war flag, but the cross flag was used alongside it in the 1240s.The Saint George's flag (i.e. the flag depicting the saint) remained the main flag of Genoa at least until the 1280s. The flag now known as the \"St. George's Cross\" seems to have replaced it as Genoa's main flag at some point during the 14th century. The Book of Knowledge of All Kingdoms (c. 1385) shows it, inscribed with the word iusti\u00e7ia, and described as:\n\nAnd the lord of this place has as his ensign a white pennant with a red cross. At the top it is inscribed with 'justice', in this manner.\nWhile it has been claimed by some that the flag of England was adopted from the Genoan flag during the First Crusade in 1190, historians conclusively have pointed to a lack of evidence of the Genoan flag had any relationship to the English one.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe city of Genoa covers an area of 243 square kilometres (94 sq mi) between the Ligurian Sea and the Apennine Mountains. The city stretches along the coast for about 30 kilometres (19 mi) from the neighbourhood of Voltri to Nervi, and for 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from the coast to the north along the valleys Polcevera and Bisagno. The territory of Genoa is popularly divided into 5 main zones: the centre, the west, the east, the Polcevera and the Bisagno Valley.\nGenoa is adjacent to two popular Ligurian vacation spots: Camogli and Portofino. In the metropolitan area of Genoa lies Aveto Natural Regional Park.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nGenoa has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, since only one summer month has less than 40 millimetres (1.57 in) of rainfall, preventing it from being classified as solely oceanic or Mediterranean, with a special note for the Genoa low.\nThe average yearly temperature is around 19 \u00b0C (66 \u00b0F) during the day and 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) at night. In the coldest months: December, January and February, the average temperature is 12 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F) during the day and 6 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F) at night. In the warmest months \u2013 July and August \u2013 the average temperature is 27.5 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F) during the day and 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F) at night. The daily temperature range is limited, with an average range of about 6 \u00b0C (11 \u00b0F) between high and low temperatures. Genoa also sees significant moderation from the sea, in stark contrast to areas behind the Ligurian mountains such as Parma, where summers are hotter and winters are quite cold.\nAnnually, the average 2.9 of nights recorded temperatures of \u22640 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) (mainly in January). The coldest temperature ever recorded was \u22128 \u00b0C (18 \u00b0F) on the night of February 2012; the highest temperature ever recorded during the day is 38.5 \u00b0C (101 \u00b0F) on the August 2015. Average annual number of days with temperatures of \u226530 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) is about 8, average four days in July and August.Average annual temperature of the sea is 17.5 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), from 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) in the period January\u2013March to 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) in August. In the period from June to October, the average sea temperature exceeds 19 \u00b0C (66 \u00b0F).Genoa is also a windy city, especially during winter when northern winds often bring cool air from the Po Valley (usually accompanied by lower temperatures, high pressure and clear skies). Another typical wind blows from southeast, mostly as a consequence of Atlantic disturbances and storms, bringing humid and warmer air from the sea. Snowfall is sporadic, but does occur almost every year, albeit big amounts in the city centre are rare.Annual average relative humidity is 68%, ranging from 63% in February to 73% in May.Sunshine hours total above 2,200 per year, from an average 4 hours of sunshine duration per day in winter to average 9 hours in summer. This value is an average between the northern half of Europe and North Africa.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Municipal government ===\nThe Municipal Council of Genoa is currently led by a right-wing majority, elected in June 2017. The mayor is Marco Bucci, expression of a right-wing alliance composed by Forza Italia, Lega Nord, Fratelli d'Italia and other minor lists. Genoa was traditionally considered a leftist city and Bucci is the first right-wing mayor since 1975.\n\n\n==== Administrative subdivision ====\nThe city of Genoa is subdivided into nine municipi (administrative districts), as approved by the Municipal Council in 2007.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Main sights ===\n\nNotable to the city are the Palazzi dei Rolli, included in UNESCO World Heritage Site Genoa: Le Strade Nuove and the system of the Palazzi dei Rolli. The world-famous Strade Nuove are via Garibaldi (Strada Nuova), via Cairoli (Strada Nuovissima) and via Balbi (Strada Balbi). Among the most important palaces are the Palazzo Rosso, Palazzo Bianco, Palazzo Podest\u00e0 o di Nicolosio Lomellino, Palazzo Reale, Palazzo Angelo Giovanni Spinola, Palazzo Pietro Spinola di San Luca and Palazzo Spinola di Pellicceria.\nGenoa's historic centre is articulated in a maze of squares and narrow caruggi (typical Genoese alleys). It joins a medieval dimension with following 16th century and Baroque interventions (the ancient Via Aurea, now Via Garibaldi).\nNear Via Garibaldi, through the public elevator Castelletto Levante, one can reach one of the most scenic places in the city, Belvedere Castelletto. The centre of Genoa is connected to its upper part by ancient paths caught between tall palaces, called creuze. Walking along these small paths one can reach magnificent places like the Santuario di Nostra Signora di Loreto. Very beautiful is the upper ring road so-called Circonvallazione a Monte that includes Corso Firenze, Corso Paganini, Corso Magenta, Via Solferino, and Corso Armellini.\nSan Lorenzo cathedral has a splendid portal and the dome designed by Galeazzo Alessi. Inside is found the treasure of the Cathedral where among other objects there is also what is said to be the Holy Chalice.\nThe symbols of the city are the Lanterna (the lighthouse) (117 metres (384 feet) high), old and standing lighthouse visible in the distance from the sea (beyond 30 kilometres (19 miles)), and the monumental fountain of Piazza De Ferrari, recently restored, out-and-out core of the city's life. Near Piazza De Ferrari and Teatro Carlo Felice is the Mazzini Gallery, a typical nineteenth-century structure with many elegant shops and coffee bars.\nAnother tourist destination is the ancient seaside district of Boccadasse (which means \"the mouth of the donkey\"), with its multicolour boats, set as a seal to Corso Italia, the promenade which runs along the Lido d'Albaro, and known for its ice-creams. After Boccadasse you can continue along the sea up to Sturla.\n\nJust out of the city centre, but still part of the 33 km (21 mi) of coast included in the municipality's territory, are Nervi, natural doorway to the Ligurian East Riviera, and Pegli, the point of access to the West Riviera. Nervi offers many attractions: the promenade overlooking the sea called Passeggiata Anita Garibaldi; parks covered with lush tropical vegetation; numerous villas and palaces open to the public that now house museums (like GAM-Galleria d'Arte Moderna, Raccolte Frugone Museum, Museo Giannettino Luxoro and Wolfsoniana). (see also Parchi di Nervi) The East Riviera of Genoa called Riviera di Levante is part of the Italian Riviera. East Riviera is full of interesting towns to visit, and then from Genoa to east are: Bogliasco, Pieve Ligure, Sori, Recco, Camogli, Portofino, Santa Margherita Ligure, Rapallo, Zoagli, Chiavari, Lavagna and Sestri Levante. In the west, Pegli is the site of the famous Villa Durazzo-Pallavicini and Arenzano is a seaside town at the foot of the Parco naturale regionale del Beigua.\nThe new Genoa based its rebirth upon the restoration of the green areas of the immediate inland parts, among them the Parco naturale regionale del Beigua, and upon the construction of facilities such as the Aquarium of Genoa in the Old Harbour - the biggest in Italy and one of the major in Europe - and its Marina (the tourist small port which holds hundreds of pleasure boats). All of these are inside the restored Expo Area, arranged in occasion of the Columbian Celebrations of 1992.\nNear the city are Camogli and San Fruttuoso abbey accessible by a daily ferry from the Old Harbour (Porto Antico) of Genoa. In the seabed in front of the San Fruttuoso abbey there is the Christ of the Abyss. From the Old Harbour one can reach by boat other famous seaside places around Genoa such as Portofino or a little more distant, Lerici and the Cinque Terre.\nThe regained pride gave back to the city the consciousness of being capable of looking to the future without forgetting its past. The resumption of several flourishing hand-crafting activities, far-back absent from the caruggi of the old town, is a direct evidence of it. The restoration of many of Genoa's churches and palaces in the 1980s and the 1990s contributed to the city's rebirth. A notable example the Renaissance, Basilica of Santa Maria Assunta, sitting on the top of the hill of Carignano and visible from almost every part of the city. The total restoration of Doge's Palace and of the Old Harbour, and the rebuilding of Teatro Carlo Felice, destroyed by bombing in the Second World War, were two more points of strength for the realisation of a new Genoa.\nGenoa could not renounce, especially as from the 1960s, to a great renewal, which as happened in several other metropolis, should necessarily get through the realisation of big public housing complexes, whose quality, utility and functionality has been and still is controversial for those residents living there. Concerning this, the most known cases are those of the so-called \"Biscione\", a development in the shape of a long snake, situated on the hills of the populous district of Marassi, and the one of the group of houses known as \"Le Lavatrici\" (the washing machines), in the district of Pr\u00e0.\nBeyond a complete restyling of the area, the ancient port zone nearby the Mandraccio opening, in Porta Siberia, was enriched by Genoese architect Renzo Piano with a large sphere made of metal and glass, installed in the port's waters, not far from the Aquarium of Genoa, and unveiled in 2001 in occasion of the G8 Summit held in Genoa. The sphere (called by the citizens \"Piano's bubble\" or \"The Ball\"), after hosting an exposition of fens from Genoa's Botanical Gardens, currently houses the reconstruction of a tropical environment, with several plants, little animals and butterflies.\nPiano also designed the subway stations and, in the hills area, the construction - in collaboration with UNESCO - of Punta Nave, base of the Renzo Piano Building Workshop.\nNearby the Old Harbour is the so-called \"Matitone\", a skyscraper in shape of a pencil, that lays side by side with the group of the WTC towers, core of the San Benigno development, today base of part of the Municipality's administration and of several companies.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nSt. Lawrence Cathedral (Cattedrale di San Lorenzo) is the city's cathedral, built in a Gothic-Romanesque style. Other notable historical churches are the Commandery of the Saint John's Order called Commenda di San Giovanni di Pr\u00e8l, San Matteo, San Donato, Santa Maria di Castello, Sant'Agostino (deconsecrated since the 19th century, sometimes is used for theatrical representations), Santo Stefano, Santi Vittore e Carlo, Basilica della Santissima Annunziata del Vastato, San Pietro in Banchi, Santa Maria delle Vigne, Nostra Signora della Consolazione, San Siro, Santa Maria Maddalena, Santa Maria Assunta di Carignano and Chiesa del Ges\u00f9. San Bartolomeo degli Armeni houses the Image of Edessa and San Pancrazio after the World War II was entrusted to the ligurian delegation of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. These churches and basilicas are built in Romanesque (San Donato, Santa Maria di Castello, Commenda di San Giovanni di Pr\u00e9), Gothic (San Matteo, Santo Stefano, Sant'Agostino), Baroque (San Siro) or Renaissance (Santa Maria Assunta di Carignano, San Pietro in Banchi) appearance, or a mix of different styles (Nostra Signora della Consolazione, Santissima Annunziata del Vastato; this last has a Baroque interior and a Neoclassicist fa\u00e7ade).\n\nAnother well known Genoese church is the shrine of Saint Francis of Paola, notable for the outer courtyard overlooking the port and the memorial to all those who died at sea. This church is of artistic mention in that the tile depictions of the Via Crucis Stations along the brick path to the church.\nNear Genoa is found the Shrine of Nostra Signora della Guardia, (the sanctuary is said to have inspired the writer Umberto Eco in making his novel The Name of the Rose). Another interesting church in the neighborhoods of Genoa is San Siro di Struppa.\nThe city was the birthplace of several popes (Innocent IV, Adrian V, Innocent VIII, and Benedict XV) and various saints (Syrus of Genoa, Romulus of Genoa, Catherine of Genoa, and Virginia Centurione Bracelli). The Archbishop of Genoa Jacobus de Varagine wrote the Golden Legend. Also from Genoa were: Giovanni Paolo Oliva, the Superior General of the Society of Jesus; Girolamo Grimaldi-Cavalleroni, the Archbishop of Aix; Ausonio Franchi, priest, philosopher, and theologian; Cardinal Giuseppe Siri; and the priests Francesco Repetto, Giuseppe Dossetti, Gianni Baget Bozzo, and Andrea Gallo. The present archbishop of Genoa, Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, comes from a Genoese family but was born in Pontevico, near Brescia (see also Archdiocese of Genoa).\n\n\n=== Buildings and palaces ===\n\nThe main features of central Genoa include the Piazza De Ferrari, around which are the Opera and the Palace of the Doges.\nThe Palazzo di San Giorgio was the headquarters of the Bank of Saint George and was the place where Marco Polo and Rustichello da Pisa composed The Travels of Marco Polo.\nOutside the city walls is Christopher Columbus House, where Christopher Columbus is said to have lived as a child. The current building is an 18th-century reconstruction of the original which was destroyed by the French naval bombing of 1684.\n\nStrada Nuova (now Via Garibaldi), in the old city, was inscribed on the World Heritage List in 2006. This district was designed in the mid-16th century to accommodate Mannerist palaces of the city's most eminent families. In Genoa there are 114 noble palaces (see also Rolli di Genova): among these 42 are inscribed on the World Heritage List. Among the Palazzi dei Rolli the most famous are Palazzo Rosso (now a museum), Palazzo Bianco, Palazzo Tursi, Palazzo Gerolamo Grimaldi, Palazzo Podest\u00e0, Palazzo Reale, Palazzo Angelo Giovanni Spinola, Palazzo Pietro Spinola di San Luca, Palazzo Spinola di Pellicceria, Palazzo Cicala. Palazzo Bianco and Palazzo Rosso are also known as Musei di Strada Nuova. The famous art college is also located on this street. The Genoese artistic renaissance begins with the construction of Villa del Principe commissioned by Andrea Doria: the architects were Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli and Giovanni Ponzello, the interior was painted by Perino del Vaga and the garden fountain was realised by Taddeo Carlone. In 1548 Galeazzo Alessi, with the project of Villa Giustiniani-Cambiaso, designed a new prototype of Genoese palace that would be an inspiration to other architects working in Genoa as Bartolomeo Bianco, Pietro Antonio Corradi, Rocco Lurago, Giovan Battista Castello, and Bernardino Cantone. Peter Paul Rubens wrote Palazzi di Genova in 1622, a book dedicated to the palaces of Genoa.\nScattered around the city are many villas, built between the fifteenth and the twentieth centuries. Among the best known are: Villa Brignole Sale Duchessa di Galliera, Villa Durazzo-Pallavicini, Villa Doria Centurione, Villa Durazzo Bombrini, Villa Serra, Villa Giustiniani-Cambiaso, Villa Rossi Martini, Villa Imperiale Scassi, Villa Grimaldi, Villa Negrone Moro, Villa Rosazza, Villetta Di Negro, Villa delle Peschiere, Villa Imperiale, Villa Saluzzo Bombrini, and Villa Grimaldi Fassio.\n\nAs it regards the 19th century remember the architects Ignazio Gardella (senior), and Carlo Barabino which among other things, realises together with Giovanni Battista Resasco, the Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno. The cemetery is renowned for its statues and sepulchral monuments that preserve the mortal remains of notable personalities, including Giuseppe Mazzini, Fabrizio De Andr\u00e9, and Constance Lloyd (Oscar Wilde's wife). In the first half of the 19th century they are completed the Albergo dei Poveri and the Acquedotto storico. In 1901 Giovanni Antonio Porcheddu realised the Silos Granari.\n\nThe city is rich in testimony of the Gothic Revival like Albertis Castle, Castello Bruzzo, Villa Canali Gaslini and Mackenzie Castle designed by the architect Gino Copped\u00e8. Genoa is also rich of Art Nouveau works, among which: Palazzo della Borsa, Via XX Settembre, Hotel Bristol Palace, Grand Hotel Miramare and Stazione marittima. Works of Rationalist architecture of the first half of the 20th century are Torre Piacentini and Piazza della Vittoria where Arco della Vittoria, both designed by the architect Marcello Piacentini. Other architects who have changed the face of Genoa in the 20th century are: Ignazio Gardella, Luigi Carlo Daneri who realised the Piazza Rossetti and the residential complex so-called Il Biscione, Mario Lab\u00f2, Aldo Rossi, Ludovico Quaroni, Franco Albini who designed the interiors of Palazzo Rosso, and Piero Gambacciani. The Edoardo Chiossone Museum of Oriental Art, designed by Mario Lab\u00f2, has one of the largest collections of Oriental art in Europe.\nOther notable architectural works include: the Old Harbour's new design with the Aquarium, the Bigo and the Biosfera by Renzo Piano, the Palasport di Genova, the Matitone skyscraper, and the Padiglione B of Genoa Fair, by Jean Nouvel. Genoa was home to the Ponte Morandi by Riccardo Morandi, built in 1967, collapsed in 2018 and demolished February-June, 2019.\n\n\n=== Old harbour ===\n\nThe old harbour (\"porto antico\" in Italian) is the ancient part of the port of Genoa. The harbour gave access to outside communities creating a good geographical situation for the city. The city is spread out geographically along a section of the Liguria coast, which makes trading by ship possible. Before the development of car, train, and airplane travel, the main outside access for the city was the sea, as the surrounding mountains made trade north by land more difficult than coastal trade. Trade routes have always connected Genoa on an international scale, with increasingly farther reach starting from trade along Europe's coastline before the medieval period to today's connection across continents. In its heyday the Genoese Navy was a prominent power in the Mediterranean.\nAs the Genoa harbour was so important to the merchants for their own economic success, other nearby harbours and ports were seen as competition for a landing point for foreign traders.  In the 16th century, the Genovese worked to destroy the local shipping competition, the Savona harbour.  Taking matters into their own hands, the Genoa merchants and the politically powerful in Genoa attacked the harbour of Savona with stones. This action was taken to preserve the economic stability and wealth of the city during the rise in prominence of Savona. The Genovese would go as far as to war with other coastal, trading cities such as Venice, in order to protect the trade industry.\nRenzo Piano redeveloped the area for public access, restoring the historical buildings (like the Cotton warehouses) and creating new landmarks like the Aquarium, the Bigo and recently the \"Bolla\" (the Sphere). The main touristic attractions of this area are the famous Aquarium and the Museum of the Sea (MuMA). In 2007 these attracted almost 1.7 million visitors.\n\n\n=== Walls and fortresses ===\n\nThe city of Genoa during its long history at least since the 9th century had been protected by different line of defensive walls. Large portions of these walls remain today, and Genoa has more and longer walls than any other city in Italy. The main city walls are known as \"Ninth century walls\", \"Barbarossa Walls\" (12th century), \"Fourteenth century walls\", \"Sixteenth century walls\" and \"New Walls\" (\"Mura Nuove\" in Italian). The more imposing walls, built in the first half of the 17th century on the ridge of hills around the city, have a length of almost 20 km (12 mi). Some fortresses stand along the perimeter of the \"New Walls\" or close them.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\n\nGenoa has 82,000 square metres (880,000 square feet) of public parks in the city centre, such as Villetta Di Negro which is right in the heart of the town, overlooking the historical centre. Many bigger green spaces are situated outside the centre: in the east are the Parks of Nervi (96,000 square metres or 1,030,000 square feet) overlooking the sea, in the west the beautiful gardens of Villa Durazzo Pallavicini and its Giardino botanico Clelia Durazzo Grimaldi. (265,000 square metres or 2,850,000 square feet). The numerous villas and palaces of the city also have their own gardens, like Palazzo del Principe, Villa Doria, Palazzo Bianco and Palazzo Tursi, Palazzo Nicolosio Lomellino, Albertis Castle, Villa Rosazza, Villa Croce, Villa Imperiale Cattaneo, Villa Bombrini, Villa Brignole Sale Duchessa di Galliera, Villa Serra and many more.The city is surrounded by natural parks such as Parco naturale regionale dell'Antola, Parco naturale regionale del Beigua, Aveto Natural Regional Park and the Ligurian Sea Cetacean Sanctuary.\n\n\n=== Aquarium of Genoa ===\n\nThe Aquarium of Genoa (in Italian: Acquario di Genova) is the largest aquarium in Italy and among the largest in Europe. Built for Genoa Expo '92, it is an educational, scientific and cultural centre. Its mission is to educate and raise public awareness as regards conservation, management and responsible use of aquatic environments. It welcomes over 1.2 million visitors a year.\nControl of the entire environment, including the temperature, filtration and lighting of the tanks was provided by local Automation Supplier Orsi Automazione, acquired in 2001 by Siemens.\nThe Aquarium of Genoa is co-ordinating the AquaRing EU project. It also provides scientific expertise and a great deal of content for AquaRing, including documents, images, academic content and interactive online courses, via its Online Resource Centre.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAt the beginning of 2011, there were 608,493 people residing in Genoa, of whom 47% were male and 53% were female. The city is characterised by rapid aging and a long history of demographic decline, that has shown a partial slowdown in the last decade. Genoa has the lowest birth rate and is the most aged of any large Italian city. Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled only 14.12% of the population compared to pensioners who number 26.67%. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06% (minors) and 19.94% (pensioners). The median age of Genoa's residents is 47, compared to the Italian average of 42. The current birth rate of the city is only 7.49 births per 1,000 inhabitants, compared to the national average of 9.45. As of 2006, 94.23% of the population was Italian. The largest immigrant group is from the Americas (mostly Ecuador): 2.76%, other European nations (mostly Albania, Ukraine, the former Yugoslavia and Romania): 1.37%, and North Africa: 0.62%. The city is predominantly Roman Catholic, with small numbers of Protestants.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Genoa metropolitan area had a GDP amounting to $30.1 billion in 2011, or $33,003 per capita.\n\nLigurian agriculture has increased its specialisation pattern in high-quality products (flowers, wine, olive oil) and has thus managed to maintain the gross value-added per worker at a level much higher than the national average (the difference was about 42% in 1999). The value of flower production represents over 75% of the agriculture sector turnover, followed by animal farming (11.2%) and vegetable growing (6.4%).\nSteel, once a major industry during the booming 1950s and 1960s, phased out after the late 1980s crisis, as Italy moved away from the heavy industry to pursue more technologically advanced and less polluting productions. So the Ligurian industry has turned towards a widely diversified range of high-quality and high-tech products (food, shipbuilding (in Sestri Ponente and in metropolitan area - Sestri Levante), electrical engineering and electronics, petrochemicals, aerospace etc.). Nonetheless, the regions still maintains a flourishing shipbuilding sector (yacht construction and maintenance, cruise liner building, military shipyards).\nIn the services sector, the gross value-added per worker in Liguria is 4% above the national average. This is due to the increasing diffusion of modern technologies, particularly in commerce and tourism.\nA good motorway network (376 km (234 mi) in 2000) makes communications with the border regions relatively easy. The main motorway is located along the coastline, connecting the main ports of Nice (in France), Savona, Genoa and La Spezia. The number of passenger cars per 1000 inhabitants (524 in 2001) is below the national average (584).\nOn average, about 17 million tonnes of cargo are shipped from the main ports of the region and about 57 million tonnes enter the region. The Port of Genoa, with a trade volume of 58.6 million tonnes ranks first in Italy, second in terms of twenty-foot equivalent units after the transshipment port of Gioia Tauro, with a trade volume of over 2 million TEUs.  The main destinations for the cargo-passenger traffic are Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Barcelona, and the Canary Islands.\nSome companies based in Genoa include Ansaldo STS, Ansaldo Energia, Edoardo Raffinerie Garrone, Piaggio Aerospace, Registro Italiano Navale, Banca Carige, SLAM, and Costa Cruises.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe first organised forms of higher education in Genoa date back to the 13th century when private colleges were entitled to award degrees in Medicine, Philosophy, Theology, Law, Arts.\nToday the University of Genoa, founded in the 15th century, is one of the largest in Italy, with 11 faculties, 51 departments and 14 libraries. In 2007\u20132008, the University had 41,000 students and 6,540 graduates.Genoa is also home to other Colleges, Academies or Museums:\n\nThe Italian Institute of Technology was established in 2003 jointly by the Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research and the Italian Minister of Economy and Finance, to promote excellence in basic and applied research. The main fields of research of the Institute are Neuroscience, Robotics, Nanotechnology, Drug discovery. The central research labs and headquarters are located in Morego, in the neighbourhood of Bolzaneto.Clemson University, based in South Carolina, United States has a villa in Genoa where architecture students and students in related fields can attend for a semester or year-long study program.\nFlorida International University (FIU), based in Miami, Florida, United States also has a small campus in Genoa, with the University of Genoa, which offers classes within the FIU School of Architecture.\n\n\n=== Science ===\n\nGenoa is the birthplace of Giovanni Battista Baliani and Vincentio Reinieri, of the geneticist Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, of the Nobel Prize astrophysicist  Riccardo Giacconi and of the astronaut Franco Malerba. The city is home to the Erzelli Hi-Tech Park, to the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, to the Istituto idrografico della Marina and annually hosts the Festival della Scienza. The city has an important tradition in the fields of the geology, paleontology, botany and naturalistic studies, among the most eminent personalities remember: Lorenzo Pareto, Luigi d'Albertis, Enrico Alberto d'Albertis, Giacomo Doria and Arturo Issel, we point the Orto Botanico dell'Universit\u00e0 di Genova. Very important and renowned is the Istituto Giannina Gaslini.\nIn 1846 the city hosted the eighth Meeting of Italian Scientists and in 1902 Luigi Carnera discovered an asteroid and called it \"485 Genua\", dedicating it to the Latin name of Genoa.\n\n\n==== Erzelli science technology park ====\n\nThe western area of Genoa hosts the Erzelli GREAT Campus, an under construction science technology park which houses the high-tech corporations Siemens, Ericsson, Esaote, and robotics laboratories of the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT).\nThe Erzelli GREAT Campus science park is undergoing a process of enlargement, and in the future will host the new Faculty of Engineering of University of Genoa. The project has been struggling in recent years with enterprises laying off their employees and no real growth.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Ports ===\n\nSeveral cruise and ferry lines serve the passenger terminals in the old port, with a traffic of 3.2 million passengers in 2007. MSC Cruises chose Genoa as one of its main home ports, in competition with the Genoese company Costa Cruises, which moved its home port to Savona. The quays of the passenger terminals extend over an area of 250,000 square metres (2,700,000 square feet), with 5 equipped berths for cruise vessels and 13 for ferries, for an annual capacity of 4 million ferry passengers, 1.5 million cars and 250,000 trucks. The historical maritime station of Ponte dei Mille is today a technologically advanced cruise terminal, with facilities designed after the world's most modern airports, to ensure fast embarking and disembarking of latest generation ships carrying thousand passengers. A third cruise terminal is currently under construction in the redesigned area of Ponte Parodi, once a quay used for grain traffic.\nThe Costa Concordia cruise ship, owned by Costa Cruises, was docked at the port before being dismantled.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\n\nThe Airport of Genoa (IATA: GOA, ICAO: LIMJ) is built on an artificial peninsula, 4 NM (7.4 km; 4.6 mi) west of the city. The airport is currently operated by Aeroporto di Genova S.P.A., which has recently upgraded the airport complex, that now connects Genoa with several daily flights to Rome, Naples, Paris, London, Madrid and Munich. In 2008, 1,202,168 passengers travelled through the airport, with an increase of international destinations and charter flights.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nThe main railway stations are Genoa Brignole in the east and Genoa Principe in the west. Genoa Brignole is close to the business districts and the exhibition centre, while the Principe is close to the port, the university and the historical centre. From these two stations depart the main trains connecting Genoa to France, Turin, Milan and Rome.\nGenoa's third most important station is Genoa Sampierdarena, which serves the densely populated neighbourhood of Sampierdarena. 23 other local stations serve the other neighbourhoods on the 30-kilometre-long coast line from Nervi to Voltri and on the northern line through Bolzaneto and the Polcevera Valley.\nThe municipal administration of Genoa plans to transform these urban railway lines to be part of the rapid transit system, which now consists of the Metropolitana di Genova (Genoa Metro),  a light metro connecting Brin to the city centre. The metro line was extended to Brignole Station in December 2012. Trains currently pass through Corvetto station between De Ferrari and Brignole without stopping. A possible further extension towards the eastern, densely populated boroughs was planned, but the municipal administration intends to improve the public transport by investing in new tram lines instead of completing the extension of the light metro. The current stations of the metro line are Brin-Certosa, Dinegro, Principe, Darsena, San Giorgio, Sant'Agostino and De Ferrari, and the line is 5.3 km (3.3 mi) long.\nThe city's hilly nature has influenced its public transport. The city is served by two funicular railways (the Zecca\u2013Righi funicular, the Sant'Anna funicular), the Quezzi inclined elevator, the Principe\u2013Granarolo rack railway, and ten public lifts.The city's metro, bus and trolleybus network is operated by AMT (Azienda Mobilit\u00e0 e Trasporti S.p.A.). The Drin Bus is a demand responsive transport service that connects the hilly, low-density areas of Genoa.\nThe average time people spend commuting on public transit in Genova, for example to and from work, is 54 min on a weekday. 10% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 12 min, while 13% of riders wait over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4 km, while 2% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Visual arts ===\n\nGenoese painters active in the 14th century include Barnaba da Modena and his local followers Nicol\u00f2 da Voltri and at the same time, the sculptor Giovanni Pisano reached Genoa to make the monument for Margaret of Brabant, whose remains are today housed in the Museum of Sant'Agostino.\nIn the 16th century along with the flourishing trade between the Republic of Genoa and Flanders also grew the cultural exchanges. The painters Lucas and Cornelis de Wael lived in Genoa for a long time, where they played the role of a magnet for many Flemish painters like Jaan Roos, Giacomo Legi, Jan Matsys, Andries van Eertvelt and Vincent Malo.\nThis creative environment also attracted the two most important Flemish painters, Rubens and Van Dyck, who along with Bernardo Strozzi. gave life to the Genoese Painting School of the 17th century.\nMuch of the city's art is found in its churches and palaces, where there are numerous Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo frescos. They are rich in works of art the Cathedral, the Chiesa del Ges\u00f9 where The Circumcision and the \"Miracles of St. Ignatius\" by Rubens, the Assunzione della Vergine by Guido Reni. The Church of San Donato contains works of Barnaba da Modena, Nicol\u00f2 da Voltri and Joos van Cleve, the Church of Santo Stefano The Stoning of St. Stephen by Giulio Romano and the Church of Santa Maria Assunta the sculptures by Filippo Parodi and Pierre Puget, very interesting is the Santa Maria di Castello. But most of the works are kept in the Palaces like Palazzo Bianco where \"Ecce Homo\" by Caravaggio, \"Susannah and the Elders\" by Veronese, and the Garden Party in Albaro by Magnasco are kept, Palazzo Rosso with the Portrait of Anton Giulio Brignole-Sale by van Dyck, Cleopatra morente by Guercino and works of D\u00fcrer, Bernardo Strozzi, Mattia Preti, Veronese; Palazzo Spinola di Pellicceria where the \"Portrait of Giovanni Carlo Doria on Horseback\" by Rubens and Ecce Homo by Antonello da Messina (see also the series of Ecce Homo by Antonello da Messina) are kept, Palazzo Tursi with the Penitent Magdalene by Canova, and Palazzo Reale which contains works of Strozzi, Gaulli, Tintoretto, van Dyck, Simon Vouet, Guercino.\nThe most important Genoese painters are: Luca Cambiaso, Bernardo and Valerio Castello, Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione, Domenico and Paolo Gerolamo Piola, Gregorio De Ferrari, Bernardo Strozzi, Giovanni Battista Gaulli and Alessandro Magnasco.

Simonetta Vespucci, considered the most beautiful woman of her time, was also born in Genoa. She is portrayed in The Birth of Venus and Primavera by Sandro Botticelli and in Portrait of Simonetta Vespucci by Piero di Cosimo.\nGenoa is also famous for its numerous tapestries, which decorated the city's many salons. Whilst the patrician palaces and villas in the city were and still are austere and majestic, the interiors tended to be luxurious and elaborate, often full of tapestries, many of which were Flemish. Famous is the Genoese lace called with its name of Turkish origin macram\u00e8. Very used in Genoa is the cobblestone called Risseu and a kind of azulejo called laggioni.\nGenoa has been likened by many to a Mediterranean New York, perhaps for its high houses that in the Middle Ages were the equivalent of today's skyscrapers, perhaps for the sea route Genoa-New York which in past centuries has been travelled by millions of emigrants. The architect Renzo Picasso in his visionary designs reinforces this strange affinity between the two cities.\nIn the Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno, you can admire some magnificent sculpture of the 19th century and early 20th century like Monteverde Angel by Giulio Monteverde, or works by artists such as Augusto Rivalta, Leonardo Bistolfi, Edoardo Alfieri, Santo Varni.\nAmongst the most notable Genoese painters of the 19th century and of the first half of the 20th century are Tammar Luxoro, Ernesto Rayper, Rubaldo Merello, and Antonio Giuseppe Santagata.

We have also remember the dialet poet Edoardo Firpo, the dialect \"poeta crepuscolare\" Giambattista Vigo,  and the symbolist Ceccardo Roccatagliata Ceccardi. The city of Genoa has been an inspiration to many writers and poets among which: Dino Campana, Camillo Sbarbaro, Gaspare Invrea who wrote \"The mouth of the wolf\" and Giorgio Caproni. Between the alleys of the historical centre there is the Old Libreria Bozzi. The \"Berio Civic Library\" houses the precious manuscript entitled \"The Durazzo Book of Hours\".

Municipal property, and located in the parks of Nervi, it has been the seat of the Genoa's Gallery of Modern Art (GAM) since 1928.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe construction of the building dates back to the 17th century and, over the centuries, belonged to the families of the Saluzzo marquises, then to the Morando, the Serra (1815) and finally the shipowner Carlo Barabino who sold it to the Municipality of Genoa in 1926 for the value of 2,200,000 lire. It was the Serra family (in the person of Gerolamo Serra) who mostly restructured the primary villa with expansions and modifications on several occasions, and transformed the original land of olive and citrus fruit into one of the most admired gardens of the Nervi park.Among the illustrious personalities who visited or stayed in the villa are the daughter Luisa Maria Amalia of King Ferdinand IV of the Two Sicilies, Frederick William III of Prussia, Queen Maria Cristina of Spain and the French historian Jules Michelet.Near the villa there is a noble chapel.\n\n\n== Garden ==\nIn 2018, the garden was part of Euroflora.\n\n\n== Gallery of Modern Art (GAM) ==\nThe gallery, where extemporaneous themed exhibitions are also organized, houses more than two thousand and seven hundred sculptures, paintings, engravings and drawings. All the material, collected from 1850, can be dated between the beginning of the 19th century and the contemporary era. Initially constituted by the collection of works of art of Prince Oddone Eugenio Maria of Savoy. The gallery displays works by Nicol\u00f2 Barabino, Ernesto Rayper, Tammar Luxoro, Pompeo Mariani, Cesare Viazzi, Alfredo D\u2019Andrade, Vincenzo Cabianca, Plinio Nomellini, Rubaldo Merello, Fortunato Depero, Felice Casorati, Filippo De Pisis, Francesco Messina, Eugenio Baroni, Arturo Martini, Renato Guttuso, Mario Mafai, Corrado Cagli.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nNervi\nParks of Genoa\nVilla Grimaldi Fassio\nGenoa: Le Strade Nuove and the system of the Palazzi dei Rolli\nEuroflora\nItalian Riviera",

        "wiki": "The walls of Genoa (mura di Genova in Italian, miage de Zena in Ligurian) constitute in their whole the several circles of walls that protected and defended the city of Genoa, former capital of the homonimous Republic. To this day, large portions of these walls remain, and Genoa has more and longer walls than any other city in Italy.\n\n\n== Ancient walls ==\n\n\n=== Ancient era and Middle Ages ===\n\nIn Roman times the original centre of Genoa, on the Sarzano hill, may have been defended by a wall, but there is no archaeological or documentary evidence of its existence.\nThe first known city walls were built in the 9th century, when thanks to Berengar II of Italy, the city gained wide autonomy, with subsequent economic development and a population increase.\nThe first walls, which included Sarzano hill, had three gates: the Serravalle gate, at the north side of the church of San Lorenzo, another on the hill of Saint Andrew, near the site of the future Porta Soprana, and another one at the end of \u201cVia Canneto il curto\u201d, near the church of San Peter.\nThe settlement enclosed by the walls and the coastline occupied about twenty-two hectares.\nSome small settlements (housing  mainly workmen and artisans), which had grown around churches, monasteries, and feudal palaces, remained outside the walls.\n\n\n=== Barbarossa walls ===\n\nIn 1155, this defensive wall was extended to the northwest to include the new settlements outside the walls. The walls culminated on the top of St. Andrew hill, with Porta Soprana.\nThe new walls greatly expanded the area contained within, compared to the previous one, including an area of 55 hectares.\nThe construction of the walls dragged until 1163; in that year, the international political situation and particularly relations with emperor Frederick Barbarossa led to an acceleration of work, as attested to by Caffaro, and the work  was completed in 53 days thanks to the effort of the entire population.\nThe three main gates had a monumental look, with high semicircular towers. Two of them survive to this day: \u201cPorta Soprana\u201d and \u201cPorta dei Vacca\u201d; the third one, Porta Aurea (\"Golden Gate\"), already partially demolished in the 18th century, was completely demolished in the second half of the 20th century. In the 13th century, the Old Pier peninsula, at the southern limit of the port, was also included inside the walls, thus completing the fortifications on the sea side of the city.\n\n\n=== The 14th century expansion ===\n\nIn the 14th century, urban expansion of the city, caused by the increase in commercial activity, led to a new extension of walls to encompass the new quarters which stood to the west and east of the original city centre.\nBetween 1320 and 1327, the east side of the walls was extended to include Carignano Hill, passing where now are the esplanade of Acquasola and the Monumental Bridge. This wall section had two gates: Porta dell'Acquasola and Porta degli Archi.\nHence, the ancient walls, still visible, continue with the names of Mura of Santa Chiara, Mura del Prato, and Mura delle Cappuccine, ending with a cliff overlooking the sea.\nFrom 1347 and 1350, another extension was built toward the west, from the fort of  Castelletto to the new St. Thomas Gate, near the present Principe railway station. This stretch of walls included a series of towers and gates which no longer exist (Carbonara, Pietraminuta, St. George, the above-mentioned St. Thomas Gate, and another tower in the place where today stands Castello d'Albertis). After this enlargement, the city wall ran for 4,550 meters, containing an area of 155 hectares.\n\n\n=== The walls in the 16th century ===\nIn the 16th century, the walls were no longer able to withstand an attack by modern firearms, so they were modified to create new Star forts.\n\nIn 1528, Andrea Doria placed the Republic of Genoa under the protection of the Spaniards. Fearing the possibility of new attacks by the French army, he promoted the modernization of the city walls, projected by Giovanni Maria Olgiati and carried out in the third decade of the 16th century. The \u201cBarbarossa walls\u201d and their 14th-century extensions were modernized by replacing the old square towers with triangular bastions and building new curtains with a counterscarp profile.\n\nA set of walls was also built along the sea, including the entire shoreline between the St. Thomas Gate and the Molo Vecchio (Old Pier). In this stretch of wall, new gates were created, one for each pier of the port.\nAt the end of Molo Vecchio in the second half of the century, Galeazzo Alessi designed Porta Siberia, an example of Renaissance military architecture. From here, the walls are linked to those already existing on the sea side of  Sarzano and Carignano hills, and they reach the mouth of Bisagno stream.\nOf the three main gates of  the 16th-century walls, Porta Siberia and the Porta degli Archi (moved from the original location for the opening of Via XX Settembre) still stand today, while the St. Thomas Gate was demolished to build the Principe railway station.\n\n\n== The Mura Nuove (New Walls) ==\n\nThe \u201cMura Nuove\u201d (New Walls) are the last and most imposing walls built along the ridge of the hills encircling downtown Genoa, and were built in the first half of the 17th century.\nThe view of Genoa from the sea is characterized by the line of New Walls with their fortifications, on the ridge of the hills, above the hilly quarters which grew after  World War II; coming from the north, by train or car, the first visible structure is the mass of Fort Diamante, high on the mount on the left bank of the Val Polcevera, and the Fort Fratello Minore. Shortly after, on the ridge in the distance is Fort Begato, included in the line of bastions that rise up to the top of Mount Peralto, where sits Fort Sperone with its high walls.\nThe \u201cNew Walls\u201d, the last and largest city walls, were built starting in 1626, after the repeated attempts of Charles Emmanuel I of Savoy to invade Genoa had convinced the government of the need for new and more powerful defensive walls.\nAlthough this defensive wall had already been suggested in 1568, the government of Genoa began the work in 1626, following the failed attack on 10 May  1625 of a French-Piedmontese army at the Pertuso Pass (where, in memory of the event, was later built the Shrine of Nostra Signora della Vittoria, meaning \"Our Lady of Victory\").\nIn less than four years, between 1629 and 1633, an army of diggers, bricklayers, and stonemasons (eight hundred, according to some sources, even three thousand according to others), divided into twenty-eight teams, raised curtains and bastions along the two ridges overlooking the valleys of Polcevera and Bisagno.\nThe project was carried out by mathematicians Vincenzo Maculano and  Giovanni Battista Baliani, a friend of Galileo Galilei.\nSupervision of the work was entrusted to Ansaldo De Mari with the cooperation of the Lombard architect Bartolomeo Bianco\n\nThe \u201cNew Walls\u201d extended for almost twenty kilometers, of which seven were along the coastline. Their construction caused the  incorporation of the quarter of San Teodoro within the walls. The walls, seen from above, have a triangular shape, the vertices being Mount Peralto, the lighthouse, and the mouth of the Bisagno stream.\nFortifications beginning from the Lighthouse of Genoa climb Granarolo Hill then reach mount Peralto, where the curtains overlooking Val Polcevera and those overlooking Val Bisagno meet; then they descend the plain along the final stretch of the Bisagno, protected by powerful bastions known as \u201cFronti Basse\u201d.\nThe waterfront was completed to defend the coastline from the lighthouse up to the western limit of the old walls (St. Thomas Gate).\nThis  structure was built on the hills even on steep slopes, in areas still sparsely populated today. This has contributed to their preservation, while the sections closest to the city were mostly demolished for the construction of new quarters and other infrastructure.\nThe length of the \u201cNew Walls\u201d reached 19,560 meters, enclosing an area of 903 hectares (nearly five times the 197 hectares included in the \u201dold walls\u201d  until the 16th century).\n\n\n=== The Eastern ridge ===\n\nFrom Fort Sperone, after a short stretch towards the southeast (Peralto Walls), the walls meet Fort Castellaccio and then different section of walls, named \u201cChiappe\u201d, \u201cSant'Erasmo\u201d, \u201cSan Bernardino\u201d, and \u201cZerbino\u201d, ending above Brignole railway station. The section of walls which used to stand here, named \"Walls of  Montesano\", were demolished in the 19th century to allow construction of the railway station.\nThe city's urban expansion eastward in the last decades of the 19th century caused the demolition of one of the most powerful and evocative parts of the New Walls, the so-called \u201cFronti Basse\u201d, a huge rampart that ran straight, with two large bastions in the plain on the right bank of the Bisagno. This large structure linked the New Walls with the \u201cSixteenth century walls\u201d from the place where now stands the railway station, up to the \u201cWalls of Prato\u201d.\nIn the \"Fronti Basse\" there were two gates, the monumental  Porta Pila (by Bartolomeo Bianco), at the end of Via Giulia (due to the completion of Via XX Settembre the gate was moved behind Brignole station), and \"Porta Romana\", at the end of Via San Vincenzo, where the ancient road to the east quarters began.\n\n\n=== The Western ridge ===\n\nFrom the top of Mount Peralto, where Fort Sperone sits, walls come down towards the southwest in a straight line to Fort Begato, then continue to fall along the panoramic road which runs along the curtain walk, taking first the name \"Walls of  Granarolo\" near the gate of the same name, then \u201cWalls of  Monte Moro\u201d. After Fort Tenaglia, the walls continue as \"Walls of  Porta Murata\" to reach the \u201cAngeli Gate\u201d and the \u201cWalls of  Angeli\u201d, where nowadays they stop abruptly due to the excavation, in the 1930s, of San Benigno Hill, an imposing rocky ridge where formerly stood the church and monastery of  San Benigno, later turned into barracks. The \u201cwalls of  San Benigno\u201d ran along the ridge of this hill and went to the lighthouse of Lanterna and the Lanterna Gate.\n\n\n=== The waterfront ===\n\nWith the 17th-century expansion, the walls along the coast were reinforced with new bastions and extended beyond St. Thomas Gate to Capo Faro, where they met those descending along the western ridge. Due to port expansion, most of the walls along the sea were demolished; only a short stretch survives, recently enhanced with a walk from the ferry terminal to the lighthouse. Close by the lighthouse there was the monumental Lantern Gate, projected by Antonio Ponsonelli, built in 1633, and demolished in 1830 following the construction of a new gate a short distance away, \u201cPorta Nuova\u201d (New Gate), which was better suited to increased traffic.\n\n\n=== The fortresses ===\nDuring the 18th century and the first half of the 19th, along the perimeter of the walls were built some fortifications, including Castellaccio, Sperone (on the top of Mount Peralto), Begato, and Tenaglia. Other forts were built in different periods on the hills outside the city walls and along the ridge on the left bank of Val Bisagno. Most of the Genoese fortifications (a total of 16) are still visible and some of them also visited.\nIn the second half of the 18th century, immediately after the Austrian siege of 1747, the fortifications were expanded with the construction of four fortresses external to the walls: Diamante, Quezzi, Richelieu, and Santa Tecla, designed  by French military engineers Jacques De Sicre and Pierre De Cotte.\nDuring the siege of Genoa of April 1800, these forts were the site of many harsh battles between French and Austrian armies.\nAfter the annexation of the Napoleonic Ligurian Republic to the Kingdom of Sardinia, decided by the Congress of Vienna in 1814, the Savoy government (1815\u20131840) built a series of forts, towers, and coastal batteries, making Genoa the best equipped fortress in the Mediterranean. The designer of this last phase of construction of the Genoese fortifications was major Giulio D'Andreis.\nForts along the perimeter of the New Walls include:\n\nFort Castellaccio (including Torre Specola)\nFort Sperone\nFort Begato\nFort TenagliaWestern Forts (Sampierdarena) include:\n\nFort Crocetta\nFort Belvedere (no longer existing)Forts on the ridges north of the walls include:\n\nFort Pu\u00ecn\nFort Fratello Minore\nFort Fratello Maggiore (demolished in 1932)\nFort DiamanteEastern Forts (Val Bisagno, Albaro):\n\nFort San Giuliano (now headquarters of the Provincial Command of the Carabinieri)\nFort San Martino\nFort Santa Tecla\nFort Quezzi\nFort Richelieu\nFort Monteratti\n\n\n=== 19th-century towers ===\nIn 1820, the Engineering Military Corps of the Kingdom of Sardinia started to build a set of towers,  external to the walls, similar to Martello towers. \nA few years later, due to cost and low usefulness, their construction was stopped. Only three of them were completed: Torre Quezzi, Torre San Bernardino, and Torre Zerbino (the last one no longer existing).\nOthers still exist in the condition in which they were left when the work was stopped, missing the second floor and the roof.\n\n\n=== New Walls today ===\nThe new walls and forts, once the purposes for which they were planned were gone, were decommissioned from military property in 1914. After this date, some of these structures were used as warehouses, jails for prisoners of war during   World War I, anti-aircraft emplacements, or houses for evacuees during  World War II. Others were given to private ownership or left abandoned. \nNowadays, although they are public property, their condition is not uniform: the main fortresses have recently been restored and may be visited on request, others, even if in a state of decay, are freely visited, and some of them host television or cellphone towers.\nThe only fort still used by a military institution is Fort San Giuliano, which overlooks Corso Italia, in the quarter of Albaro, now headquarters of the Provincial Command of the Carabinieri.\nThe \"New Walls\" and the forts are now included in the \"Parco Urbano delle Mura\" (City Park of Walls), having a surface of 876 hectares, which is the largest green \"lung\" of Genoa, and provides the possibility of different excursions of historic and wildlife interest.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nStefano Finauri, Forti di Genova: storia, tecnica e architettura dei fortini difensivi, Edizioni Servizi Editoriali, Genoa 2007, ISBN 978-88-89384-27-5\nRiccardo Dellepiane, Mura e fortificazioni di Genova, Nuova Editrice Genovese, Genoa 1984 (reprinted in 2008, ISBN 978-88-88963-22-8)\nPiera Melli, La citt\u00e0 ritrovata.

        "wiki": "Genoa ( JEN-oh-\u0259; Italian: Genova [\u02c8d\u0292\u025b\u02d0nova] (listen); Ligurian: Z\u00eana [\u02c8ze\u02d0na]; English, historically, and Latin: Genua) is the capital of the Italian region of Liguria and the sixth-largest city in Italy. In 2015, 594,733 people lived within the city's administrative limits. As of the 2011 Italian census, the Province of Genoa, which in 2015 became the Metropolitan City of Genoa, counted 855,834 resident persons. Over 1.5 million people live in the wider metropolitan area stretching along the Italian Riviera.Located on the Gulf of Genoa in the Ligurian Sea, Genoa has historically been one of the most important ports on the Mediterranean: it is currently the busiest in Italy and in the Mediterranean Sea and twelfth-busiest in the European Union. Genoa has been nicknamed la Superba (\"the proud one\") due to its glorious past and impressive landmarks. Part of the old town of Genoa was inscribed on the World Heritage List (UNESCO) in 2006 as Genoa: Le Strade Nuove and the system of the Palazzi dei Rolli. The city's rich cultural history in art, music and cuisine allowed it to become the 2004 European Capital of Culture. It is the birthplace of Guglielmo Embriaco, Christopher Columbus, Andrea Doria, Niccol\u00f2 Paganini, Giuseppe Mazzini, Renzo Piano and Grimaldo Canella, founder of the House of Grimaldi, among others.\nGenoa, which forms the southern corner of the Milan-Turin-Genoa industrial triangle of Northwest Italy, is one of the country's major economic centers. The city has hosted massive shipyards and steelworks since the 19th century, and its solid financial sector dates back to the Middle Ages. The Bank of Saint George, founded in 1407, is among the oldest in the world and has played an important role in the city's prosperity since the middle of the 15th century. A number of leading Italian companies are based in the city, including Fincantieri, Selex ES, Ansaldo Energia, Ansaldo STS, Edoardo Raffinerie Garrone, Piaggio Aerospace, Mediterranean Shipping Company and Costa Cruises.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe city's modern name may derive from the Latin word meaning \"knee\" (genu; plural, genua) but there are other theories. It could derive from the god Janus, because Genoa, like him, has two faces: a face that looks at the sea and another turned to the mountains. Or it could come from the Latin word ianua, also related to the name of the God Janus, and meaning \"door\" or \"passage.\" Besides that, it may refer to its geographical position at the centre of the Ligurian coastal arch. The Latin name, oppidum Genua, is recorded by Pliny the Elder (Nat. Hist. 3.48) as part of the Augustean Regio IX Liguria.Another theory traces the name to the Etruscan word Kainua which means \"New City\", based on an inscription on a pottery sherd reading Kainua, suggests that the Latin name may be a corruption of an older Etruscan one with an original meaning of \"new town\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Genoa area has been inhabited since the fifth or fourth millennium BC. In the 5th century BC the first town, or oppidum, was founded at the top of the hill today called Castello (Castle), which is now inside the medieval old town. Among the ancient inhabitants of the region were the Ligures, that gave the name to the modern Liguria. \nGenoa is a port city by birth, establishing itself as the merchant capital of the newly established Republic of Genoa in 1005 and maintaining its independence until 1797. Throughout its existence the Republic had different forms of government, the most notable of these was the Dogate, that in actuality, was an oligarchy ruled by a group of wealthy merchant families, from whom the doges were selected.\nDuring the Late Middle Ages Genoa was one of the main commercial powers of the Mediterranean Sea, while between the 16th and 17th centuries it was one of the major financial centers in Europe.The earliest known state deposit bank, Banco di San Giorgio (Bank of St. George), was founded in 1407 at Genoa.\nThe fleet's participation in the Crusades allowed Genoa to further establish prosperous trading colonies, in fact, throughout its history, the Republic extended its direct domain in numerous territories, including Corsica, Cyprus, Tabarka, Chios and Southern Crimea.Thereafter, Genovese bankers, financed many of the Spanish crown's foreign endeavors. Fernand Braudel has even called the period 1557 to 1627 the \"age of the Genovese\", \"of a rule that was so discreet and sophisticated that historians for a long time failed to notice it\".However, since the 16th century, Genoa began to lose almost all of its colonies across the Mediterranean, and the influence of the once powerful republic began to decline.It was 1796 that the Republic of Genoa finally ended, replaced by Napoleonic ruled Ligurian Republic. Since 1815 after the \"Congresso di Vienna\" Genoa was annexed to the Regno di Sardegna (Sardinia Kingdom). Italian unification of 1861 resulted in Genoa becoming the maritime hub of the new Italian state.\n\n\n=== Flag ===\n\nThe flag of Genoa is a St. George's Cross, a red cross on a white field.\nThe patron saint of Genoa was Saint Lawrence until at least 958, but the Genoese transferred their allegiance to Saint George (and Saint John the Baptist) at some point during the 11th or 12th century, most likely with the rising popularity of the military saint during the Crusades. Genoa also had a banner displaying a cross since at latest 1218, possibly as early as 1113. But the cross banner was not associated with the saint; indeed, the saint had his own flag, the vexillum beati Georgii (first mentioned 1198), a red flag showing George and the dragon. A depiction of this flag is shown in the Genoese annals under the year 1227. The Genoese flag with the red cross was used alongside this \"Saint George's flag\", from at least 1218, known as the insignia cruxata comunis Janue (\"cross ensign of the commune of Genoa\"). \nThe saint's flag was the city's main war flag, but the cross flag was used alongside it in the 1240s.The Saint George's flag (i.e. the flag depicting the saint) remained the main flag of Genoa at least until the 1280s. The flag now known as the \"St. George's Cross\" seems to have replaced it as Genoa's main flag at some point during the 14th century. The Book of Knowledge of All Kingdoms (c. 1385) shows it, inscribed with the word iusti\u00e7ia, and described as:\n\nAnd the lord of this place has as his ensign a white pennant with a red cross. At the top it is inscribed with 'justice', in this manner.\nWhile it has been claimed by some that the flag of England was adopted from the Genoan flag during the First Crusade in 1190, historians conclusively have pointed to a lack of evidence of the Genoan flag had any relationship to the English one.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe city of Genoa covers an area of 243 square kilometres (94 sq mi) between the Ligurian Sea and the Apennine Mountains. The city stretches along the coast for about 30 kilometres (19 mi) from the neighbourhood of Voltri to Nervi, and for 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from the coast to the north along the valleys Polcevera and Bisagno. The territory of Genoa is popularly divided into 5 main zones: the centre, the west, the east, the Polcevera and the Bisagno Valley.\nGenoa is adjacent to two popular Ligurian vacation spots: Camogli and Portofino. In the metropolitan area of Genoa lies Aveto Natural Regional Park.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nGenoa has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, since only one summer month has less than 40 millimetres (1.57 in) of rainfall, preventing it from being classified as solely oceanic or Mediterranean, with a special note for the Genoa low.\nThe average yearly temperature is around 19 \u00b0C (66 \u00b0F) during the day and 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) at night. In the coldest months: December, January and February, the average temperature is 12 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F) during the day and 6 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F) at night. In the warmest months \u2013 July and August \u2013 the average temperature is 27.5 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F) during the day and 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F) at night. The daily temperature range is limited, with an average range of about 6 \u00b0C (11 \u00b0F) between high and low temperatures. Genoa also sees significant moderation from the sea, in stark contrast to areas behind the Ligurian mountains such as Parma, where summers are hotter and winters are quite cold.\nAnnually, the average 2.9 of nights recorded temperatures of \u22640 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) (mainly in January). The coldest temperature ever recorded was \u22128 \u00b0C (18 \u00b0F) on the night of February 2012; the highest temperature ever recorded during the day is 38.5 \u00b0C (101 \u00b0F) on the August 2015. Average annual number of days with temperatures of \u226530 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) is about 8, average four days in July and August.Average annual temperature of the sea is 17.5 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), from 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) in the period January\u2013March to 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) in August. In the period from June to October, the average sea temperature exceeds 19 \u00b0C (66 \u00b0F).Genoa is also a windy city, especially during winter when northern winds often bring cool air from the Po Valley (usually accompanied by lower temperatures, high pressure and clear skies). Another typical wind blows from southeast, mostly as a consequence of Atlantic disturbances and storms, bringing humid and warmer air from the sea. Snowfall is sporadic, but does occur almost every year, albeit big amounts in the city centre are rare.Annual average relative humidity is 68%, ranging from 63% in February to 73% in May.Sunshine hours total above 2,200 per year, from an average 4 hours of sunshine duration per day in winter to average 9 hours in summer. This value is an average between the northern half of Europe and North Africa.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Municipal government ===\nThe Municipal Council of Genoa is currently led by a right-wing majority, elected in June 2017. The mayor is Marco Bucci, expression of a right-wing alliance composed by Forza Italia, Lega Nord, Fratelli d'Italia and other minor lists. Genoa was traditionally considered a leftist city and Bucci is the first right-wing mayor since 1975.\n\n\n==== Administrative subdivision ====\nThe city of Genoa is subdivided into nine municipi (administrative districts), as approved by the Municipal Council in 2007.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Main sights ===\n\nNotable to the city are the Palazzi dei Rolli, included in UNESCO World Heritage Site Genoa: Le Strade Nuove and the system of the Palazzi dei Rolli. The world-famous Strade Nuove are via Garibaldi (Strada Nuova), via Cairoli (Strada Nuovissima) and via Balbi (Strada Balbi). Among the most important palaces are the Palazzo Rosso, Palazzo Bianco, Palazzo Podest\u00e0 o di Nicolosio Lomellino, Palazzo Reale, Palazzo Angelo Giovanni Spinola, Palazzo Pietro Spinola di San Luca and Palazzo Spinola di Pellicceria.\nGenoa's historic centre is articulated in a maze of squares and narrow caruggi (typical Genoese alleys). It joins a medieval dimension with following 16th century and Baroque interventions (the ancient Via Aurea, now Via Garibaldi).\nNear Via Garibaldi, through the public elevator Castelletto Levante, one can reach one of the most scenic places in the city, Belvedere Castelletto. The centre of Genoa is connected to its upper part by ancient paths caught between tall palaces, called creuze. Walking along these small paths one can reach magnificent places like the Santuario di Nostra Signora di Loreto. Very beautiful is the upper ring road so-called Circonvallazione a Monte that includes Corso Firenze, Corso Paganini, Corso Magenta, Via Solferino, and Corso Armellini.\nSan Lorenzo cathedral has a splendid portal and the dome designed by Galeazzo Alessi. Inside is found the treasure of the Cathedral where among other objects there is also what is said to be the Holy Chalice.\nThe symbols of the city are the Lanterna (the lighthouse) (117 metres (384 feet) high), old and standing lighthouse visible in the distance from the sea (beyond 30 kilometres (19 miles)), and the monumental fountain of Piazza De Ferrari, recently restored, out-and-out core of the city's life. Near Piazza De Ferrari and Teatro Carlo Felice is the Mazzini Gallery, a typical nineteenth-century structure with many elegant shops and coffee bars.\nAnother tourist destination is the ancient seaside district of Boccadasse (which means \"the mouth of the donkey\"), with its multicolour boats, set as a seal to Corso Italia, the promenade which runs along the Lido d'Albaro, and known for its ice-creams. After Boccadasse you can continue along the sea up to Sturla.\n\nJust out of the city centre, but still part of the 33 km (21 mi) of coast included in the municipality's territory, are Nervi, natural doorway to the Ligurian East Riviera, and Pegli, the point of access to the West Riviera. Nervi offers many attractions: the promenade overlooking the sea called Passeggiata Anita Garibaldi; parks covered with lush tropical vegetation; numerous villas and palaces open to the public that now house museums (like GAM-Galleria d'Arte Moderna, Raccolte Frugone Museum, Museo Giannettino Luxoro and Wolfsoniana). (see also Parchi di Nervi) The East Riviera of Genoa called Riviera di Levante is part of the Italian Riviera. East Riviera is full of interesting towns to visit, and then from Genoa to east are: Bogliasco, Pieve Ligure, Sori, Recco, Camogli, Portofino, Santa Margherita Ligure, Rapallo, Zoagli, Chiavari, Lavagna and Sestri Levante. In the west, Pegli is the site of the famous Villa Durazzo-Pallavicini and Arenzano is a seaside town at the foot of the Parco naturale regionale del Beigua.\nThe new Genoa based its rebirth upon the restoration of the green areas of the immediate inland parts, among them the Parco naturale regionale del Beigua, and upon the construction of facilities such as the Aquarium of Genoa in the Old Harbour - the biggest in Italy and one of the major in Europe - and its Marina (the tourist small port which holds hundreds of pleasure boats). All of these are inside the restored Expo Area, arranged in occasion of the Columbian Celebrations of 1992.\nNear the city are Camogli and San Fruttuoso abbey accessible by a daily ferry from the Old Harbour (Porto Antico) of Genoa. In the seabed in front of the San Fruttuoso abbey there is the Christ of the Abyss. From the Old Harbour one can reach by boat other famous seaside places around Genoa such as Portofino or a little more distant, Lerici and the Cinque Terre.\nThe regained pride gave back to the city the consciousness of being capable of looking to the future without forgetting its past. The resumption of several flourishing hand-crafting activities, far-back absent from the caruggi of the old town, is a direct evidence of it. The restoration of many of Genoa's churches and palaces in the 1980s and the 1990s contributed to the city's rebirth. A notable example the Renaissance, Basilica of Santa Maria Assunta, sitting on the top of the hill of Carignano and visible from almost every part of the city. The total restoration of Doge's Palace and of the Old Harbour, and the rebuilding of Teatro Carlo Felice, destroyed by bombing in the Second World War, were two more points of strength for the realisation of a new Genoa.\nGenoa could not renounce, especially as from the 1960s, to a great renewal, which as happened in several other metropolis, should necessarily get through the realisation of big public housing complexes, whose quality, utility and functionality has been and still is controversial for those residents living there. Concerning this, the most known cases are those of the so-called \"Biscione\", a development in the shape of a long snake, situated on the hills of the populous district of Marassi, and the one of the group of houses known as \"Le Lavatrici\" (the washing machines), in the district of Pr\u00e0.\nBeyond a complete restyling of the area, the ancient port zone nearby the Mandraccio opening, in Porta Siberia, was enriched by Genoese architect Renzo Piano with a large sphere made of metal and glass, installed in the port's waters, not far from the Aquarium of Genoa, and unveiled in 2001 in occasion of the G8 Summit held in Genoa. The sphere (called by the citizens \"Piano's bubble\" or \"The Ball\"), after hosting an exposition of fens from Genoa's Botanical Gardens, currently houses the reconstruction of a tropical environment, with several plants, little animals and butterflies.\nPiano also designed the subway stations and, in the hills area, the construction - in collaboration with UNESCO - of Punta Nave, base of the Renzo Piano Building Workshop.\nNearby the Old Harbour is the so-called \"Matitone\", a skyscraper in shape of a pencil, that lays side by side with the group of the WTC towers, core of the San Benigno development, today base of part of the Municipality's administration and of several companies.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nSt. Lawrence Cathedral (Cattedrale di San Lorenzo) is the city's cathedral, built in a Gothic-Romanesque style. Other notable historical churches are the Commandery of the Saint John's Order called Commenda di San Giovanni di Pr\u00e8l, San Matteo, San Donato, Santa Maria di Castello, Sant'Agostino (deconsecrated since the 19th century, sometimes is used for theatrical representations), Santo Stefano, Santi Vittore e Carlo, Basilica della Santissima Annunziata del Vastato, San Pietro in Banchi, Santa Maria delle Vigne, Nostra Signora della Consolazione, San Siro, Santa Maria Maddalena, Santa Maria Assunta di Carignano and Chiesa del Ges\u00f9. San Bartolomeo degli Armeni houses the Image of Edessa and San Pancrazio after the World War II was entrusted to the ligurian delegation of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. These churches and basilicas are built in Romanesque (San Donato, Santa Maria di Castello, Commenda di San Giovanni di Pr\u00e9), Gothic (San Matteo, Santo Stefano, Sant'Agostino), Baroque (San Siro) or Renaissance (Santa Maria Assunta di Carignano, San Pietro in Banchi) appearance, or a mix of different styles (Nostra Signora della Consolazione, Santissima Annunziata del Vastato; this last has a Baroque interior and a Neoclassicist fa\u00e7ade).\n\nAnother well known Genoese church is the shrine of Saint Francis of Paola, notable for the outer courtyard overlooking the port and the memorial to all those who died at sea. This church is of artistic mention in that the tile depictions of the Via Crucis Stations along the brick path to the church.\nNear Genoa is found the Shrine of Nostra Signora della Guardia, (the sanctuary is said to have inspired the writer Umberto Eco in making his novel The Name of the Rose). Another interesting church in the neighborhoods of Genoa is San Siro di Struppa.\nThe city was the birthplace of several popes (Innocent IV, Adrian V, Innocent VIII, and Benedict XV) and various saints (Syrus of Genoa, Romulus of Genoa, Catherine of Genoa, and Virginia Centurione Bracelli). The Archbishop of Genoa Jacobus de Varagine wrote the Golden Legend. Also from Genoa were: Giovanni Paolo Oliva, the Superior General of the Society of Jesus; Girolamo Grimaldi-Cavalleroni, the Archbishop of Aix; Ausonio Franchi, priest, philosopher, and theologian; Cardinal Giuseppe Siri; and the priests Francesco Repetto, Giuseppe Dossetti, Gianni Baget Bozzo, and Andrea Gallo. The present archbishop of Genoa, Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, comes from a Genoese family but was born in Pontevico, near Brescia (see also Archdiocese of Genoa).\n\n\n=== Buildings and palaces ===\n\nThe main features of central Genoa include the Piazza De Ferrari, around which are the Opera and the Palace of the Doges.\nThe Palazzo di San Giorgio was the headquarters of the Bank of Saint George and was the place where Marco Polo and Rustichello da Pisa composed The Travels of Marco Polo.\nOutside the city walls is Christopher Columbus House, where Christopher Columbus is said to have lived as a child. The current building is an 18th-century reconstruction of the original which was destroyed by the French naval bombing of 1684.\n\nStrada Nuova (now Via Garibaldi), in the old city, was inscribed on the World Heritage List in 2006. This district was designed in the mid-16th century to accommodate Mannerist palaces of the city's most eminent families. In Genoa there are 114 noble palaces (see also Rolli di Genova): among these 42 are inscribed on the World Heritage List. Among the Palazzi dei Rolli the most famous are Palazzo Rosso (now a museum), Palazzo Bianco, Palazzo Tursi, Palazzo Gerolamo Grimaldi, Palazzo Podest\u00e0, Palazzo Reale, Palazzo Angelo Giovanni Spinola, Palazzo Pietro Spinola di San Luca, Palazzo Spinola di Pellicceria, Palazzo Cicala. Palazzo Bianco and Palazzo Rosso are also known as Musei di Strada Nuova. The famous art college is also located on this street. The Genoese artistic renaissance begins with the construction of Villa del Principe commissioned by Andrea Doria: the architects were Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli and Giovanni Ponzello, the interior was painted by Perino del Vaga and the garden fountain was realised by Taddeo Carlone. In 1548 Galeazzo Alessi, with the project of Villa Giustiniani-Cambiaso, designed a new prototype of Genoese palace that would be an inspiration to other architects working in Genoa as Bartolomeo Bianco, Pietro Antonio Corradi, Rocco Lurago, Giovan Battista Castello, and Bernardino Cantone. Peter Paul Rubens wrote Palazzi di Genova in 1622, a book dedicated to the palaces of Genoa.\nScattered around the city are many villas, built between the fifteenth and the twentieth centuries. Among the best known are: Villa Brignole Sale Duchessa di Galliera, Villa Durazzo-Pallavicini, Villa Doria Centurione, Villa Durazzo Bombrini, Villa Serra, Villa Giustiniani-Cambiaso, Villa Rossi Martini, Villa Imperiale Scassi, Villa Grimaldi, Villa Negrone Moro, Villa Rosazza, Villetta Di Negro, Villa delle Peschiere, Villa Imperiale, Villa Saluzzo Bombrini, and Villa Grimaldi Fassio.\n\nAs it regards the 19th century remember the architects Ignazio Gardella (senior), and Carlo Barabino which among other things, realises together with Giovanni Battista Resasco, the Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno. The cemetery is renowned for its statues and sepulchral monuments that preserve the mortal remains of notable personalities, including Giuseppe Mazzini, Fabrizio De Andr\u00e9, and Constance Lloyd (Oscar Wilde's wife). In the first half of the 19th century they are completed the Albergo dei Poveri and the Acquedotto storico. In 1901 Giovanni Antonio Porcheddu realised the Silos Granari.\n\nThe city is rich in testimony of the Gothic Revival like Albertis Castle, Castello Bruzzo, Villa Canali Gaslini and Mackenzie Castle designed by the architect Gino Copped\u00e8. Genoa is also rich of Art Nouveau works, among which: Palazzo della Borsa, Via XX Settembre, Hotel Bristol Palace, Grand Hotel Miramare and Stazione marittima. Works of Rationalist architecture of the first half of the 20th century are Torre Piacentini and Piazza della Vittoria where Arco della Vittoria, both designed by the architect Marcello Piacentini. Other architects who have changed the face of Genoa in the 20th century are: Ignazio Gardella, Luigi Carlo Daneri who realised the Piazza Rossetti and the residential complex so-called Il Biscione, Mario Lab\u00f2, Aldo Rossi, Ludovico Quaroni, Franco Albini who designed the interiors of Palazzo Rosso, and Piero Gambacciani. The Edoardo Chiossone Museum of Oriental Art, designed by Mario Lab\u00f2, has one of the largest collections of Oriental art in Europe.\nOther notable architectural works include: the Old Harbour's new design with the Aquarium, the Bigo and the Biosfera by Renzo Piano, the Palasport di Genova, the Matitone skyscraper, and the Padiglione B of Genoa Fair, by Jean Nouvel. Genoa was home to the Ponte Morandi by Riccardo Morandi, built in 1967, collapsed in 2018 and demolished February-June, 2019.\n\n\n=== Old harbour ===\n\nThe old harbour (\"porto antico\" in Italian) is the ancient part of the port of Genoa. The harbour gave access to outside communities creating a good geographical situation for the city. The city is spread out geographically along a section of the Liguria coast, which makes trading by ship possible. Before the development of car, train, and airplane travel, the main outside access for the city was the sea, as the surrounding mountains made trade north by land more difficult than coastal trade. Trade routes have always connected Genoa on an international scale, with increasingly farther reach starting from trade along Europe's coastline before the medieval period to today's connection across continents. In its heyday the Genoese Navy was a prominent power in the Mediterranean.\nAs the Genoa harbour was so important to the merchants for their own economic success, other nearby harbours and ports were seen as competition for a landing point for foreign traders.  In the 16th century, the Genovese worked to destroy the local shipping competition, the Savona harbour.  Taking matters into their own hands, the Genoa merchants and the politically powerful in Genoa attacked the harbour of Savona with stones. This action was taken to preserve the economic stability and wealth of the city during the rise in prominence of Savona. The Genovese would go as far as to war with other coastal, trading cities such as Venice, in order to protect the trade industry.\nRenzo Piano redeveloped the area for public access, restoring the historical buildings (like the Cotton warehouses) and creating new landmarks like the Aquarium, the Bigo and recently the \"Bolla\" (the Sphere). The main touristic attractions of this area are the famous Aquarium and the Museum of the Sea (MuMA). In 2007 these attracted almost 1.7 million visitors.\n\n\n=== Walls and fortresses ===\n\nThe city of Genoa during its long history at least since the 9th century had been protected by different line of defensive walls. Large portions of these walls remain today, and Genoa has more and longer walls than any other city in Italy. The main city walls are known as \"Ninth century walls\", \"Barbarossa Walls\" (12th century), \"Fourteenth century walls\", \"Sixteenth century walls\" and \"New Walls\" (\"Mura Nuove\" in Italian). The more imposing walls, built in the first half of the 17th century on the ridge of hills around the city, have a length of almost 20 km (12 mi). Some fortresses stand along the perimeter of the \"New Walls\" or close them.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\n\nGenoa has 82,000 square metres (880,000 square feet) of public parks in the city centre, such as Villetta Di Negro which is right in the heart of the town, overlooking the historical centre. Many bigger green spaces are situated outside the centre: in the east are the Parks of Nervi (96,000 square metres or 1,030,000 square feet) overlooking the sea, in the west the beautiful gardens of Villa Durazzo Pallavicini and its Giardino botanico Clelia Durazzo Grimaldi. (265,000 square metres or 2,850,000 square feet). The numerous villas and palaces of the city also have their own gardens, like Palazzo del Principe, Villa Doria, Palazzo Bianco and Palazzo Tursi, Palazzo Nicolosio Lomellino, Albertis Castle, Villa Rosazza, Villa Croce, Villa Imperiale Cattaneo, Villa Bombrini, Villa Brignole Sale Duchessa di Galliera, Villa Serra and many more.The city is surrounded by natural parks such as Parco naturale regionale dell'Antola, Parco naturale regionale del Beigua, Aveto Natural Regional Park and the Ligurian Sea Cetacean Sanctuary.\n\n\n=== Aquarium of Genoa ===\n\nThe Aquarium of Genoa (in Italian: Acquario di Genova) is the largest aquarium in Italy and among the largest in Europe. Built for Genoa Expo '92, it is an educational, scientific and cultural centre. Its mission is to educate and raise public awareness as regards conservation, management and responsible use of aquatic environments. It welcomes over 1.2 million visitors a year.\nControl of the entire environment, including the temperature, filtration and lighting of the tanks was provided by local Automation Supplier Orsi Automazione, acquired in 2001 by Siemens.\nThe Aquarium of Genoa is co-ordinating the AquaRing EU project. It also provides scientific expertise and a great deal of content for AquaRing, including documents, images, academic content and interactive online courses, via its Online Resource Centre.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAt the beginning of 2011, there were 608,493 people residing in Genoa, of whom 47% were male and 53% were female. The city is characterised by rapid aging and a long history of demographic decline, that has shown a partial slowdown in the last decade. Genoa has the lowest birth rate and is the most aged of any large Italian city. Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled only 14.12% of the population compared to pensioners who number 26.67%. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06% (minors) and 19.94% (pensioners). The median age of Genoa's residents is 47, compared to the Italian average of 42. The current birth rate of the city is only 7.49 births per 1,000 inhabitants, compared to the national average of 9.45. As of 2006, 94.23% of the population was Italian. The largest immigrant group is from the Americas (mostly Ecuador): 2.76%, other European nations (mostly Albania, Ukraine, the former Yugoslavia and Romania): 1.37%, and North Africa: 0.62%. The city is predominantly Roman Catholic, with small numbers of Protestants.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Genoa metropolitan area had a GDP amounting to $30.1 billion in 2011, or $33,003 per capita.\n\nLigurian agriculture has increased its specialisation pattern in high-quality products (flowers, wine, olive oil) and has thus managed to maintain the gross value-added per worker at a level much higher than the national average (the difference was about 42% in 1999). The value of flower production represents over 75% of the agriculture sector turnover, followed by animal farming (11.2%) and vegetable growing (6.4%).\nSteel, once a major industry during the booming 1950s and 1960s, phased out after the late 1980s crisis, as Italy moved away from the heavy industry to pursue more technologically advanced and less polluting productions. So the Ligurian industry has turned towards a widely diversified range of high-quality and high-tech products (food, shipbuilding (in Sestri Ponente and in metropolitan area - Sestri Levante), electrical engineering and electronics, petrochemicals, aerospace etc.). Nonetheless, the regions still maintains a flourishing shipbuilding sector (yacht construction and maintenance, cruise liner building, military shipyards).\nIn the services sector, the gross value-added per worker in Liguria is 4% above the national average. This is due to the increasing diffusion of modern technologies, particularly in commerce and tourism.\nA good motorway network (376 km (234 mi) in 2000) makes communications with the border regions relatively easy. The main motorway is located along the coastline, connecting the main ports of Nice (in France), Savona, Genoa and La Spezia. The number of passenger cars per 1000 inhabitants (524 in 2001) is below the national average (584).\nOn average, about 17 million tonnes of cargo are shipped from the main ports of the region and about 57 million tonnes enter the region. The Port of Genoa, with a trade volume of 58.6 million tonnes ranks first in Italy, second in terms of twenty-foot equivalent units after the transshipment port of Gioia Tauro, with a trade volume of over 2 million TEUs.  The main destinations for the cargo-passenger traffic are Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Barcelona, and the Canary Islands.\nSome companies based in Genoa include Ansaldo STS, Ansaldo Energia, Edoardo Raffinerie Garrone, Piaggio Aerospace, Registro Italiano Navale, Banca Carige, SLAM, and Costa Cruises.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe first organised forms of higher education in Genoa date back to the 13th century when private colleges were entitled to award degrees in Medicine, Philosophy, Theology, Law, Arts.\nToday the University of Genoa, founded in the 15th century, is one of the largest in Italy, with 11 faculties, 51 departments and 14 libraries. In 2007\u20132008, the University had 41,000 students and 6,540 graduates.Genoa is also home to other Colleges, Academies or Museums:\n\nThe Italian Institute of Technology was established in 2003 jointly by the Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research and the Italian Minister of Economy and Finance, to promote excellence in basic and applied research. The main fields of research of the Institute are Neuroscience, Robotics, Nanotechnology, Drug discovery. The central research labs and headquarters are located in Morego, in the neighbourhood of Bolzaneto.Clemson University, based in South Carolina, United States has a villa in Genoa where architecture students and students in related fields can attend for a semester or year-long study program.\nFlorida International University (FIU), based in Miami, Florida, United States also has a small campus in Genoa, with the University of Genoa, which offers classes within the FIU School of Architecture.\n\n\n=== Science ===\n\nGenoa is the birthplace of Giovanni Battista Baliani and Vincentio Reinieri, of the geneticist Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, of the Nobel Prize astrophysicist  Riccardo Giacconi and of the astronaut Franco Malerba. The city is home to the Erzelli Hi-Tech Park, to the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, to the Istituto idrografico della Marina and annually hosts the Festival della Scienza. The city has an important tradition in the fields of the geology, paleontology, botany and naturalistic studies, among the most eminent personalities remember: Lorenzo Pareto, Luigi d'Albertis, Enrico Alberto d'Albertis, Giacomo Doria and Arturo Issel, we point the Orto Botanico dell'Universit\u00e0 di Genova. Very important and renowned is the Istituto Giannina Gaslini.\nIn 1846 the city hosted the eighth Meeting of Italian Scientists and in 1902 Luigi Carnera discovered an asteroid and called it \"485 Genua\", dedicating it to the Latin name of Genoa.\n\n\n==== Erzelli science technology park ====\n\nThe western area of Genoa hosts the Erzelli GREAT Campus, an under construction science technology park which houses the high-tech corporations Siemens, Ericsson, Esaote, and robotics laboratories of the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT).\nThe Erzelli GREAT Campus science park is undergoing a process of enlargement, and in the future will host the new Faculty of Engineering of University of Genoa. The project has been struggling in recent years with enterprises laying off their employees and no real growth.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Ports ===\n\nSeveral cruise and ferry lines serve the passenger terminals in the old port, with a traffic of 3.2 million passengers in 2007. MSC Cruises chose Genoa as one of its main home ports, in competition with the Genoese company Costa Cruises, which moved its home port to Savona. The quays of the passenger terminals extend over an area of 250,000 square metres (2,700,000 square feet), with 5 equipped berths for cruise vessels and 13 for ferries, for an annual capacity of 4 million ferry passengers, 1.5 million cars and 250,000 trucks. The historical maritime station of Ponte dei Mille is today a technologically advanced cruise terminal, with facilities designed after the world's most modern airports, to ensure fast embarking and disembarking of latest generation ships carrying thousand passengers. A third cruise terminal is currently under construction in the redesigned area of Ponte Parodi, once a quay used for grain traffic.\nThe Costa Concordia cruise ship, owned by Costa Cruises, was docked at the port before being dismantled.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\n\nThe Airport of Genoa (IATA: GOA, ICAO: LIMJ) is built on an artificial peninsula, 4 NM (7.4 km; 4.6 mi) west of the city. The airport is currently operated by Aeroporto di Genova S.P.A., which has recently upgraded the airport complex, that now connects Genoa with several daily flights to Rome, Naples, Paris, London, Madrid and Munich. In 2008, 1,202,168 passengers travelled through the airport, with an increase of international destinations and charter flights.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nThe main railway stations are Genoa Brignole in the east and Genoa Principe in the west. Genoa Brignole is close to the business districts and the exhibition centre, while the Principe is close to the port, the university and the historical centre. From these two stations depart the main trains connecting Genoa to France, Turin, Milan and Rome.\nGenoa's third most important station is Genoa Sampierdarena, which serves the densely populated neighbourhood of Sampierdarena. 23 other local stations serve the other neighbourhoods on the 30-kilometre-long coast line from Nervi to Voltri and on the northern line through Bolzaneto and the Polcevera Valley.\nThe municipal administration of Genoa plans to transform these urban railway lines to be part of the rapid transit system, which now consists of the Metropolitana di Genova (Genoa Metro),  a light metro connecting Brin to the city centre. The metro line was extended to Brignole Station in December 2012. Trains currently pass through Corvetto station between De Ferrari and Brignole without stopping. A possible further extension towards the eastern, densely populated boroughs was planned, but the municipal administration intends to improve the public transport by investing in new tram lines instead of completing the extension of the light metro. The current stations of the metro line are Brin-Certosa, Dinegro, Principe, Darsena, San Giorgio, Sant'Agostino and De Ferrari, and the line is 5.3 km (3.3 mi) long.\nThe city's hilly nature has influenced its public transport. The city is served by two funicular railways (the Zecca\u2013Righi funicular, the Sant'Anna funicular), the Quezzi inclined elevator, the Principe\u2013Granarolo rack railway, and ten public lifts.The city's metro, bus and trolleybus network is operated by AMT (Azienda Mobilit\u00e0 e Trasporti S.p.A.). The Drin Bus is a demand responsive transport service that connects the hilly, low-density areas of Genoa.\nThe average time people spend commuting on public transit in Genova, for example to and from work, is 54 min on a weekday. 10% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 12 min, while 13% of riders wait over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4 km, while 2% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Visual arts ===\n\nGenoese painters active in the 14th century include Barnaba da Modena and his local followers Nicol\u00f2 da Voltri and at the same time, the sculptor Giovanni Pisano reached Genoa to make the monument for Margaret of Brabant, whose remains are today housed in the Museum of Sant'Agostino.\nIn the 16th century along with the flourishing trade between the Republic of Genoa and Flanders also grew the cultural exchanges. The painters Lucas and Cornelis de Wael lived in Genoa for a long time, where they played the role of a magnet for many Flemish painters like Jaan Roos, Giacomo Legi, Jan Matsys, Andries van Eertvelt and Vincent Malo.\nThis creative environment also attracted the two most important Flemish painters, Rubens and Van Dyck, who along with Bernardo Strozzi. gave life to the Genoese Painting School of the 17th century.\nMuch of the city's art is found in its churches and palaces, where there are numerous Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo frescos. They are rich in works of art the Cathedral, the Chiesa del Ges\u00f9 where The Circumcision and the \"Miracles of St. Ignatius\" by Rubens, the Assunzione della Vergine by Guido Reni. The Church of San Donato contains works of Barnaba da Modena, Nicol\u00f2 da Voltri and Joos van Cleve, the Church of Santo Stefano The Stoning of St. Stephen by Giulio Romano and the Church of Santa Maria Assunta the sculptures by Filippo Parodi and Pierre Puget, very interesting is the Santa Maria di Castello.

Simonetta Vespucci, considered the most beautiful woman of her time, was also born in Genoa. She is portrayed in The Birth of Venus and Primavera by Sandro Botticelli and in Portrait of Simonetta Vespucci by Piero di Cosimo.\nGenoa is also famous for its numerous tapestries, which decorated the city's many salons. Whilst the patrician palaces and villas in the city were and still are austere and majestic, the interiors tended to be luxurious and elaborate, often full of tapestries, many of which were Flemish. Famous is the Genoese lace called with its name of Turkish origin macram\u00e8. Very used in Genoa is the cobblestone called Risseu and a kind of azulejo called laggioni.\nGenoa has been likened by many to a Mediterranean New York, perhaps for its high houses that in the Middle Ages were the equivalent of today's skyscrapers, perhaps for the sea route Genoa-New York which in past centuries has been travelled by millions of emigrants. The architect Renzo Picasso in his visionary designs reinforces this strange affinity between the two cities.\nIn the Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno, you can admire some magnificent sculpture of the 19th century and early 20th century like Monteverde Angel by Giulio Monteverde, or works by artists such as Augusto Rivalta, Leonardo Bistolfi, Edoardo Alfieri, Santo Varni.\nAmongst the most notable Genoese painters of the 19th century and of the first half of the 20th century are Tammar Luxoro, Ernesto Rayper, Rubaldo Merello, and Antonio Giuseppe Santagata. The sculptor Francesco Messina also grew up in Genoa.\nIn 1967 the Genoese historian, critic and curator Germano Celant coined the term Arte Povera. Enrico Accatino was another important art theorist and Emanuele Luzzati was the production designer and illustrator like Lorenzo Mongiardino, also a production designer and architect.

We have also remember the dialet poet Edoardo Firpo, the dialect \"poeta crepuscolare\" Giambattista Vigo,  and the symbolist Ceccardo Roccatagliata Ceccardi. The city of Genoa has been an inspiration to many writers and poets among which: Dino Campana, Camillo Sbarbaro, Gaspare Invrea who wrote \"The mouth of the wolf\" and Giorgio Caproni. Between the alleys of the historical centre there is the Old Libreria Bozzi. The \"Berio Civic Library\" houses the precious manuscript entitled \"The Durazzo Book of Hours\".

The theatre was the centre of music and social life in the 19th century. On various occasions in the history of the theatre, presentations have been conducted by Mascagni, Richard Strauss, Hindemith and Stravinsky. Other Genoese theaters are the Politeama Genovese, Teatro Stabile in Genoa, Teatro della Tosse and Teatro Gustavo Modena.\nOn the occasion of the Christopher Columbus celebration in 1992, new musical life was given to the area around the old port, including the restoration of the house of Paganini and presentations of the trallalero, the traditional singing of Genoese dock workers.\nThe trallalero, traditional music in the Genoese dialect, is a polyphonic vocal music, performed by five men and several songs.

Scott Fitzgerald, Paul Klee. Giuseppe Verdi, Giacomo Puccini, and Pietro Mascagni. Verdi in his work, Simon Boccanegra, is inspired by the medieval history of the city. The poets Dino Campana, Camillo Sbarbaro and Giorgio Caproni have made Genoa a recurring element of their poetic work.\nFamous Genoese include Sinibaldo and Ottobuono Fieschi (Popes Innocent IV and Adrian V), Giovanni Battista Cybo (Pope Innocent VIII) and Giacomo della Chiesa (Pope Benedict XV), navigators Christopher Columbus, Antonio de Noli, Enrico Alberto d'Albertis, Enrico de Candia (Henry, Count of Malta) and Andrea Doria, composers Niccol\u00f2 Paganini and Michele Novaro, Italian patriots Giuseppe Mazzini, Goffredo Mameli and Nino Bixio, writer and translator Fernanda Pivano, poet Edoardo Sanguineti, Communist politician Palmiro Togliatti, architect Renzo Piano, art curator and critic Germano Celant, Physics 2002 Nobel Prize winner Riccardo Giacconi, Literature 1975 Nobel Prize winner Eugenio Montale, the court painter Giovanni Maria delle Piane (Il Mulinaretto) from the Delle Piane family, artists Vanessa Beecroft, Enrico Accatino, comedians Gilberto Govi, Paolo Villaggio, Beppe Grillo, Luca Bizzarri, Paolo Kessisoglu and Maurizio Crozza; singer-songwriters Fabrizio de Andr\u00e9, Ivano Fossati, Umberto Bindi, Bruno Lauzi and Francesco Baccini, while Luigi Tenco and Gino Paoli are also known as Genoese singer-songwriters, although they are respectively from Cassine and Monfalcone; actor Vittorio Gassman, and actress Moana Pozzi, Giorgio Parodi who conceived the motorcycle company Moto Guzzi with Carlo Guzzi and Giovanni Ravelli.\nSome reports say the navigator and explorer Giovanni Caboto (John Cabot) was also from Genoa, others say he was from Savona. Saints from Genoa include Romulus, Syrus, Catherine of Genoa. Among the latest generations, musicians like Andrea Bacchetti, Giulio Plotino, Sergio Ciomei, Lorenzo Cavasanti, Stefano Bagliano and Fabrizio Cipriani, as well as academics and authors like Michele Giugliano and Roberto Dillon, help in keeping the name of the city on the international spotlight in different fields among the arts, technology and culture.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\n\n=== Promenades ===\nCorso Italia runs for 2.5 km (1.6 mi) in the quartiere of Albaro, linking two neighbourhoods of Foce and Boccadasse.

        "wiki": "Pr\u00e8 (pron. /\u02c8pr\u025b/) is a neighbourhood in the old town of the Italian city of Genoa.\nIt was one of the six sestieri of ancient Genoa. At present it is part of the Genoa's city I Municipio (Centro Est). Located close to the old harbour, it is likely the best-known neighbourhood of the old town of Genoa.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nPr\u00e8 takes its name from the Latin word pr\u00e6dia (fields), because in origin this was a rural zone. The use of this term is documented since 1131.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nOn 31 December 2015 there were 7,586 people living in Pr\u00e8, with a population density of 16,858 people per km\u00b2.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nPr\u00e8 is located north west in the old town of Genoa, between two circles of city walls, the older Barbarossa walls (12th century) and the 14th century city walls, but includes also a small portion of old town inside the Barbarossa walls, with via del Campo. The neighbourhood occupies the semi-plain area between the port and the rear hill.\nThe central and most characteristic area of the neighborhood is that of Via Pr\u00e8 and Via del Campo, with its narrow alleys (the typical Genoese \"caruggi\"), upstream of which is Via Balbi with its noble palaces.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first settlements in the area date back to the second half of 12th century, when outside of the \"Saint Faith Gate\" (now called \"Vacca's Gate\") of the \"Barbarossa\" walls some buildings were built to assist travelers along the road leading from the city to the west. Included were several hospitals, founded by religious orders to offer accommodation and assistance to Crusaders, pilgrims, and merchants who were traveling from the port of Genoa to the Holy Land and the East. The best known of these was the Commandery of St. John of Pr\u00e8, of the Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem, or Knights Hospitaller, built in 1180.In the same period, dockyards for repairing ships were built in the near port, in the same place where two centuries later would be established the main base of the Genoese Navy. This first port terminal gave an economic boost to the development of the neighbourhood. In 1347, the whole neighborhood was enclosed into the city walls, by building a new section of walls on the north-west side.During the 17th century the noble families of Balbi and Durazzo built, upstream the neighbourhood some luxurious palaces along a new wide street, Strada Balbi. In the 19th century another important road was opened, Carlo Alberto road, suitable for transit of wagons coming to and from the port and in 1860 the Genoa Principe railway station was completed in the north west area of Pr\u00e8.\nIn the 20th century, when the business centre of Genoa moved from the old town to De Ferrari Square, a period of decline began for Pr\u00e8, and after World War II some areas were populated by petty criminals who earned their living by cigarette smuggling, prostitution and receiving stolen goods.During the seventies the alleys of Pr\u00e8 became a centre of narcotics smuggling, managed before by Italian mafias and later by non-EU immigrants, causing the abandonment by most of the original inhabitants and the consequent degradation of buildings. Today, after many years of decline also these areas of the neighbourhood are showing signs of recovery.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Palazzi dei Rolli ===\n\nThe \"Rolli di Genova\" were, at the time of the Republic of Genoa, an official list of public lodging palaces of eminent Genoese families which aspired to host, by draw, foreign notable people visiting Genoa. Most of these buildings still exist, and in 2006 forty-two of them were inscribed by UNESCO in the list of World Heritage Site.\nIn Pr\u00e8 are 20 of these palaces (11 of which included in the list of World Heritage Site).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Royal Palace ===\n\nAmong Rolli Stefano Balbi palace, best known as the Royal Palace is the most remarkable. It was built in 17th century and on 1824 was purchased by the king Charles Felix of Sardinia as the residence of the royal court in Genoa. In 1919 Victor Emmanuel III handed it over to Italian state, together with its art collections.\n\n\n=== University Palace ===\n\nIn Via Balbi the former College of the Jesuits, designed by Bartolomeo Bianco between 1634 and 1636, hosts since 1775 the seat of the University of Genoa. Bianco was inspired by the model developed by Domenico and Giovanni Ponzello for Doria-Tursi palace, built at different levels, adapted to the slope of the land, with a spectacular marble staircase that from the entrance hall leads to a raised courtyard, surrounded by columns, from which other staircases reach the upper floors and the rear botanical garden.The palace today houses the rectorate office, some university departments and administrative offices. Next to the building is the former church of Saints Jerome and Francis Xavier, built in the mid 17th century, now university library, where ancient manuscripts and incunables are preserved.\n\n\n=== D'Albertis Castle ===\n D'Albertis Castle was built in Neo- Gothic style between 1886 and 1892 on the ruins of a 16th-century bastion of the city walls, overlooking the city from a hill on the border between the neighbourhoods of Pr\u00e8 and Castelletto, for the explorer Enrico Alberto d'Albertis. When he died, in 1932, the castle was donated to the city of Genoa, along with the collections he had gathered in his travels, that make up the original nucleus of the Museum of World Cultures, housed in the castle.\n\n\n=== Vacca's Gate ===\nSt. Faith Gate, known as Vacca's Gate, was part of the \"Barbarossa\" city walls and was built in the 12th century. In 17th century it was incorporated in two noble palaces. The gate, west entrance to the city, like the best known and coeval \"Porta Soprana\", consists of two semicircular crenellated towers on either sides of a lancet arch.\n\n\n=== Galata Museo del Mare ===\nThe Galata Museo del Mare is a maritime museum designed by the Spanish architect Guillermo V\u00e1zquez Consuegra. The museum, inaugurated in 2004, is located in the ancient \"Darsena\", the base of the Genoese Navy's fleet between the 13th and the 18th century and incorporates the dockyard called Galata (from the name of the Genoese colony in the homonymous district of Istanbul) where at the time of the Republic of Genoa war galleys were built and maintained.\nThe museum occupies 20 halls on an area of about 10,000 m\u00b2. Since September 2009 the submarine Nazario Sauro, retired from the Italian Navy in 2002, has been moored in the small harbor basin in front of the museum, adapted for public visits and integrated in the museum visit path.\n\n\n=== Places of Worship ===\n\n\n==== Commandery of St. John of Pr\u00e8 ====\nThe Commandery of St. John of Pr\u00e8 is a complex founded in 1180 that includes two Romanesque churches at different levels, a monastery that belonged to the Knights Hospitaller and a hospital to offer accommodation and assistance to Crusaders and pilgrims sailing from the port of Genoa to the Holy Land.\nDuring all Middle Ages it had been an important point of reference for all travelers transiting in the port of Genoa.\n\n\n==== Basilica della SS. Annunziata del Vastato ====\n\nThe Basilica della Santissima Annunziata del Vastato, simply called \"Nunziata\", is a major Genoese church. The interior of the church is Baroque, but the fa\u00e7ade, with a high portico and two bell towers, was built only in the 19th century in Neoclassical style.\nThe interior has a Latin cross plant with a nave and two aisles with some chapels decorated with frescoes, paintings, inlaid marble and stucco, works by the greatest Genoese artists of the 17th century.The church, built in 1520 in Gothic style, anachronistic at that time, was given its present Baroque appearance in the first half of the 17th century by architects Giovanni Domenico Casella and Giacomo Porta, with the funding of Lomellini family. Giovanni Battista and Giovanni Carlone made frescoes in the ceiling of the nave, aisles and transept.The Neoclassical fa\u00e7ade, designed by Giovanni Battista Resasco in the 19th century, has a tall portico with six Ionic columns. The serious damage wrought by bombing during World War II has been restored in postwar era.\n\n\n==== Other Catholic churches ====\nSanti Vittore e Carlo, in Baroque style, is located in via Balbi. It was built in 1635 by Bartolomeo Bianco.\nNostra Signora del Carmine e Sant'Agnese is located in via Brignole De Ferrari. The church, built in 1262, was restored over the centuries, but its interior preserves the original Gothic structure.\nSan Sisto, located in via Pr\u00e8, was founded at the end of the 11th century but completely rebuilt in Neoclassical style in 1828 by Giovanni Battista Resasco and Pietro Pellegrini.\nSan Filippo Neri, in late-Baroque style, is located in via Lomellini, and was built in the second half of 17th century. Close the church is the oratory (18th century), that for its excellent acoustics is often used as a concert hall.\nSan Marcellino is a small and simple church near to via del Campo, where the future pope Innocent VIII was baptized. It is one of the oldest church of Genoa. It is documented since 11th century, but was completely rebuilt in the 17th century.\nSanta Fede, currently deconsecrated, is documented since 12th century and it was rebuilt in Baroque style in 1673. It is located in via delle Fontane, opposite Vacca's Gate. At present it hosts municipal offices.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nSt. Ugo Canefri (1148\u20131233), Knight Hospitaller, lived most of his life in the Commandery of St. John of Pr\u00e8.\nGiovanni Battista Cybo (1432\u20131492), pope since 1484 as Innocent VIII, born in Pr\u00e8 and baptized in the church of St. Marcellino\nPalmiro Togliatti (1893\u20131964), communist politician, was born in Pr\u00e8, where his family temporarily resided, but he lived in Genoa only few years in his childhood\nFabrizio De Andr\u00e9 (1940\u20131999), singer-songwriter, has indissolubly linked his name with via del Campo, the street to which he devoted a famous song and where a former music shop is now a small museum of his life and his music (Via del Campo 29 rosso).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGuida d\u2019Italia \u2013 Liguria.

        "wiki": "Portofino (Italian pronunciation: [\u02ccp\u0254rto\u02c8fi\u02d0no]; Ligurian: Portofin [\u02ccp\u0254\u027etu\u02c8fi\u014b]) is an Italian fishing village and holiday resort famous for its picturesque harbour and historical association with celebrity and artistic visitors. It is a comune located in the Metropolitan City of Genoa on the Italian Riviera. The town is clustered around its small harbour, and is known for the colourfully painted buildings that line the shore.\n\n\n== History ==\nPliny the Elder (AD 23 \u2013 AD 79) referred to Portus Delphini (Port of the Dolphin) as on the Ligurian coast between Genoa and the Gulf of Tigullio.The village is mentioned in a diploma from 986 by Adelaide of Italy, which assigned it to the nearby Abbey of San Fruttuoso di Capodimonte. In 1171, together with the neighbouring Santa Margherita Ligure, it was included in Rapallo's commune jurisdiction. After 1229 it was part of the Republic of Genoa. The town's natural harbour supported a fleet of fishing boats, but was somewhat too cramped to provide more than a temporary safe haven for the growing merchant marine of the Republic of Genoa.\nIn 1409 Portofino was sold to the Republic of Florence by Charles VI of France, but when the latter was ousted from Genoa the Florentines gave it back. In the 15th century it was a fief of families such as the Fieschi, Spinola, Adorno, and Doria.\nIn 1815 it became part of the Kingdom of Sardinia and, from 1861, of the unified Kingdom of Italy.\nIn the late 19th century, first British, then other Northern European aristocratic tourists began to visit Portofino, which they reached by horse and cart from Santa Margherita Ligure. Aubrey Herbert and Elizabeth von Arnim were amongst the more famous English people to make the area fashionable. Eventually, more expatriates built expensive vacation houses, and by 1950 tourism had replaced fishing as the town's chief industry, and the waterfront was a continuous ring of restaurants and caf\u00e9s.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\nStatue of Christ of the Abyss, placed underwater on 29 August 1954 in the inlet at a depth of 17 metres (56 ft). This statue was placed to protect fishermen and scuba divers and in memory of Dario Gonzatti, the first Italian to use SCUBA gear, who died in 1947. Sculpted by Guido Galletti, it represents Christ in the act of blessing while looking up towards the sky with open arms in a sign of peace.\nCastello Brown (16th century).\nChurch of St. Martin (Divo Martino, 12th century).\nChurch of St. George, housing some saints' relics.\nOratory of Santa Maria Assunta, in Gothic style.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Enchanted April, a 1922 best-selling novel by Elizabeth von Arnim based on the author's stay in Castello Brown, is credited with making Portofino fashionable. The novel was the basis of a 1991 feature filmed in the Castello, with a cast including Joan Plowright, Miranda Richardson and Alfred Molina. The film was nominated for three Oscars.Portofino is often thought to be the inspiration for Sir Clough Williams-Ellis' Italianate village named Portmeirion, built between 1925 and 1975, in north Wales. However, this was repeatedly denied by the architect. He stated only that he wanted to pay tribute to the atmosphere of the Mediterranean. He did, however, draw on a love of the Italian village, stating \"How should I not have fallen for Portofino? Indeed its image remained with me as an almost perfect example of the man-made adornment and use of an exquisite site.\"In 1959 Dalida released song \"Love in Portofino\", written by Leo Chiosso and composed by Fred Buscaglione. With lyrics in French and Italian language, it became a hit and was later iconized alongside the village's name. It also spawned several international covers, including Andrea Bocelli's in 2013 which was followed by a concert recorded and issued on DVD.Portofino is the eponym of Frank Schaeffer's Portofino: A Novel (1992). It was the first of Schaeffer's Calvin Becker Trilogy.Portofino is one of the shooting locations of the 1995 Antonioni / Wenders film, Beyond the Clouds.There is a full-scale replication, in authentic detail, of Portofino Bay at Universal Orlando Resort in Orlando, USA, which opened in September 1999.Portofino inspired in 2001 a recreation of the seaside town in the Mediterranean Harbor area at Tokyo DisneySea in Chiba, Japan. It also served as the namesake for the restaurant Cafe Portofino.Portofino was also featured in 2008 for the television series Top Gear (Episode 5, Series 12). Richard Hammond, in a Ferrari Daytona raced James May in a carbon fibre powerboat from Portofino to St Tropez in France.Ferrari named one of their new V8 sports cars after Portofino in 2017.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nKing Richard I of England (1157-1199), in 1190\nPope Gregory XI (1330-1378), in 1377\nHenry Herbert (1831-1890), British Politician\nGuy de Maupassant (1850-1893), French writer\nGuglielmo Marconi (1874-1937), Italian engineer, inventor of radio\nGiuseppe Amisani (1879-1941), Italian painter\nMichele Cascella (1892-1989), Italian painter\nRex Harrison (1908-1990), English actor\nLilli Palmer (1914-1986), German actress, wife of Rex Harrison\n\n\n== Twin towns ==\n Kinsale, Republic of Ireland\n Palma, Spain\n Cassis, France\n\n\n== See also ==\nItalian Riviera\nList of castles in Italy\nCastello Brown\nCervara Abbey\nParaggi\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n Portofino travel guide from Wikivoyage\nPortofino\nPortofino tourism\nCity Hall\nPortofino Natural Park\nVirtual tour, Marine\nLove in Portofino song on YouTube",

        "wiki": "King John's Castle (Irish: Caisle\u00e1n Luimnigh) is a 13th-century castle located on King's Island in Limerick, Ireland, next to the River Shannon. Although the site dates back to 922 when the Vikings lived on the Island, the castle itself was built on the orders of King John in 1200. One of the best preserved Norman castles in Europe, the walls, towers and fortifications remain today and are visitor attractions. The remains of a Viking settlement were uncovered during archaeological excavations at the site in 1900.\n\n\n== Before the Castle ==\nThe Viking sea-king, Tomrair mac Ailchi, built the first permanent Viking stronghold on Inis Sibhtonn (King's Island) in 922. He used the base to raid the length of the River Shannon from Lough Derg to Lough Ree, pillaging ecclesiastical settlements. In 937 the Limerick Vikings clashed with those of Dublin on Lough Ree and were defeated. In 943 they were defeated again when the chief of the local Dalcassian clan joined with Ceallach\u00e1n, king of Munster and the Limerick Vikings were forced to pay tribute to the clans. The power of the Vikings never recovered, and they were reduced to the level of a minor clan, however often playing pivotal parts in the endless power struggles of the next few centuries.\n\n\n== Early history ==\nThe arrival of the Anglo-Normans to the area in 1172 changed everything. Domhnall M\u00f3r \u00d3 Briain burned the city to the ground in 1174 in a bid to keep it from the hands of the new invaders. After he died in 1194, the Anglo-Normans finally captured the area in 1195 under John, Lord of Ireland. In 1197,  Limerick was given its first charter and its first Mayor, Adam Sarvant. A castle, built on the orders of King John and bearing his name, was completed around 1210.\nThe castle was built on the boundary of the River Shannon in order to protect the city from the Gaelic kingdoms to the west and from any rebellion by Norman lords to the east and south. Under the general peace imposed by the Norman rule, Limerick prospered as both a port and a trading centre, partly due to the castle acting as a watchdog on any cargo passing through the port of Limerick. By this time the city was divided into an area became known as \"English Town\" on King's Island, while another settlement, named \"Irish Town\" had grown on the south bank of the river. The town of Limerick became so wealthy during this era King John set up a mint in the North West corner of the castle, with pennies and half pennies from this time available to see in Limerick museum today. A 1574 document prepared for the Spanish ambassador attests to its wealth:\n\nLimerick is stronger and more beautiful than all the other cities of Ireland, well walled with stout walls of hewn marble... There is no entrance except by stone bridges, one of the two of which has 14 arches, and the other 8 ... for the most part the houses are of square stone of black marble and built in the form of towers and fortresses.\nLuke Gernon, an English-born judge and resident of Limerick, wrote an equally flattering account of the city in 1620:\n\na lofty building of marble; in the high street it is built from one gate to the other in one form, like the colleges in Oxford, so magnificent that at my first entrance it did amaze me\".\n\n\n== Siege of Limerick ==\nThe walls of the castle were severely damaged in the 1642 Siege of Limerick, the first of five sieges of the city in the 17th century. In 1642, the castle was occupied by Protestants fleeing the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and was besieged by an Irish Confederate force under Garret Barry. Barry had no siege artillery so he undermined the walls of King John's Castle by digging away their foundations. Those inside surrendered just before Barry collapsed the walls. However, such was the damage done to the wall's foundations that a section of them had to be pulled down afterward.\n\n\n== 2013 Redevelopment ==\nBetween 2011 and 2013, the castle underwent a massive redevelopment, with \u20ac5.7 million spent to improve the visitor facilities of the castle. Among the improvements were a brand new visitor centre, interactive exhibitions with computer generated animations, and a cafe with views onto the courtyard and the river.\n\n\n== See also ==\nKing John of England\nHistory of Limerick City\nLimerick City Museum, just to the south\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nShannon Heritage site\nList of constables of the castle",

          "King John\u2019s Castle provides a deep look into Ireland\u2019s rich history, long before the castle was built in the early 13th century. A detailed exhibit on early Gaelic society (6th century) includes an overview of the legal system known as the Brehon Laws. The key takeaway for me",

          "We enjoyed this castle a lot. It\u2019s unique in that there are actors showing activities that would have been going on when the castle was in use (a blacksmith, archer, etc). Also there are exhibits & replicas in the rooms showing their original use. A great, interactive learning",
          "I have been to a lot but this is surprisingly one of the best. It\u2019s very interactive and not boring at all, lots of things to engage the kids along the way too, little ones and big ones. My partner especially liked that he got to have a go with the bow and arrow. Would highly",
          "We visited the castle on a day where the yard was being transformed into a concert place with stage and bars. The place was not kept well. It was very dirty. Pigeons had made nests in the towers and had made the whole place disgusting. It should have been cleaned. Three guys",
          "This was our fourth stop along the trip in Ireland and it was a great choice. Cheap and lots of cool things to look at, history lessons, and they even had some swordsman to teach you sword fighting up on top of the site.",
          "Our family of 19 found this a highlight in the trip. So much history and background. You could almost place yourself back in that era. In the courtyard 2 gentlemen in period dress were mock sword fighting and they were a wealth of information. They took time to let all",

          "Not much of the castle is accessible but the displays and exhibitions inside are quite informative and educational. I like the diorama approach with some interactive features. It amazes me how irrelevant battles in out of the way plac s can even matter, but they do.",
          "A bit pricey but still enjoyed being there with family. Would love if there was more castle to view. The interactive stations were a bit lower in volume.",
          "Since the renovation the castle is much more interesting. Lots of information and plenty to see. You can also walk up to the towers for a view of the city. At almost \u20ac12 I think that's a bit pricey but that I wouldn't regret paying that. You are also free to walk around without",
          "This was a photo op stop on our tour in Limerick. Located on the banks of the Shannon River, the castle dates back to the 1200s and was built to fortify the defenses of the city. We could see costumed characters in the courtyard awaiting a visit of students from a preschool.",
          "Enjoyable! The museum portion is interesting, a bit emotional, and generally well done. There were exhibits that needed light bulbs changed but this only diminished slightly from the exhibit..their gift shop.is amazing. Lovely products for sale,beautiful jewelery!",

          "Nothing like Blarney castle but still a good place to visit at it has a lot of history. The museum is several floors with a lot of information and videos about all of the history. Worth a visit if you're in Limerick.",
          "Myself, my 3 yr old and my parents saw this event advertised locally. As the day was beautiful we meandered from Corbally up to the castle. Firstly admission didn't cost anything as it was free entry for first few hours which was brilliant.from the moment we entered the staff",
          "When traveling in Ireland I love coming across the countless examples of the nation's past in the form of castles, castle ruins, and small towns. To that end I feel compelled to understand better Ireland's past. King John's Castle is one such form to get some better",
          "We just went for this gig but my god it was a magical location for it. Seeing the castle around while the bands played....great gig!!! Great location and cannot wait to go back some day!",
          "I drove by the castle and just had to stop and admire the majestic building overlooking the Shannon. I\u2019ve seen it often whilst in Limerick and would love to see it from the inside.",
          "I had a few hours off during my business trip to Limerick so I decided to go to King John's Castle to kill some time. I was expecting a tour of a castle, which I got, but I wasn't expecting the high quality history museum that is there as well! The museum has one of the best",
          "This is a must. Today was a drizzly morning and we arrived 15mins early before opening but the cafe owner of the castle was so thoughtful he allowed us to step inside and wait until opening of the castle and his cafe. That is service. A big thank you. The whole tour was great",
          "Absolutely amazing history and good admission price. The staff were lovely and very knowledgeable about the castle and it\u2019s history! The courtyard is lots of fun and the museum is very educational.",
          "Interesting walk through the castle. We chose to walk ourselves rather than the guided tour. Would we recommend - yes. Would we do again - no. A glimpse back into the daily lives.",
          "Great time at this castle we really enjoyed the day here and also walked about if limerick too. Definitely a must see",
          "I enjoyed the touring King John's Castle. They offer free guided tours or you can walk through on your own! We caught a guided tour and I enjoyed following that through the museum portion. After that our guide told us where things were and we explored the castle again! Would",
          "Really disappointing visit to the castle. The previous evening had seen a 'pop' concert and there was still a lot of equipment, staging obscuring the views of the walls. It all looked very sad and certainly wasn't what we'd expected. I did think that, as we bought our",
          "We decided last night that this morning, before leaving Limerick, we would visit King John's Castle, which we did. Unfortunately, we only had about an hour in the castle (self-guided tour) and had to leave without seeing some of the displays. (I would suggest staying a good 2",
          "When we arrived in Limerick, we weren\u2019t planning on seeing King John\u2019s Castle, as we were initially only planning on being in town for a few hours and seeing a museum. However, when we found ourselves there for the full day, I wanted to take advantage and see all the",
          "Much of the castle remains from the 12th century and the exhibitions inside give a superb background history lesson of Ireland and the castle's place in it through the centuries. Definitely worth a visit and a modest admission charge.",
          "The castle grounds and the information were very interesting but the views from the top were a real treat.",
          "I found this castle (museum) very interesting. It provides the visitor an insight into Irish history. It does so with interactive games, short audio-visual presentations, artefacts, and so the approach is varied. The visit takes you down to the foundations,, through the",
          "An authentic castle in downtown Limerick on the river side. What else do you need? Swans? Okay, they are there too. Nice architecture in the older building and neighbourhood.",
          "It was an ok experience but many of the museum areas were too loud. You could hear the audio from multiple displays at one time and the acoustics made conversations echo. The towers were cool to see and they had a courtyard with a person to introduce guests to archery and",
          "What a place! King John's Castle is a must go place to visit and not only absorb the cultural period of its historical roots but also go get lost in time. Theres plenty to keep everyone occupied and interested. Take a steady March up the very narrow spiral stairs and take a look",
          "We stopped in for a tour of the castle after breakfast nearby. I have been to lots of castles in Europe but this one was very well done. The museum portion really helped us to learn about the history of the castle and was child friendly. The ruins were easily accessible, gave",
          "This was one of the highlights of our tour around Ireland. Lots of interactive exhibits inside. We learned a lot about Irish history here. A well preserved castle with lots to see. Great caf\u00e9 too!",
          "My wife and I visited this castle and had a great time. They show you how the castle was constructed and you can actually go under it and see how \"enemies\" would undermine it and gain entry. Unlike a couple other castles we visited, this one actually let you see how it was,",
          "During our tour of Ireland we did not have the opportunity this time to visit the castle on the spot and from the inside, we were pleased to see the exciting building from afar and it really dominates Limerick's city silhouette.",
          "The castle is a great place to visit. The exhibits engaging and the historical information helpful for understanding the context of events and the relationships between kings, queens, their subjects, confidantes, enemies and the poor souls who suffered (mostly) under them.",
          "There is so much to this castle! so so much. Take your time, explore and absolutely use the stairs to the very top. you can see all of limerick and you won't be disappointed AT ALL!",

          "The exhibit on the history of the castle and the evens since its build was really good. The tour is easy done without a guide.",
          "Amazing and all I got to do was walk around the out side. Really wish I had the time in the day to go in. This castle looks to be in such good condition. Location is perfect. Got some good photos outside as I said some history on it would have been nice.",
          "There is some good history to absorb on your castle adventure. Multiple spots for a birds eye view of Limerick.",
          "While not the most complete castle in Ireland it has a ton of history with a lot of exhibitions. It\u2019s definitely worth a visit, you\u2019ll leave more educated than you came in.",
          "So interesting to walk thru the self guided tour thru the castle and grounds. The poor Irish..the wars..,rebellions, ,famines, Can,t believe they survived all that! Beautiful countryside, and people.....we Love Ireland.",
          "We were on the guided tour of the castle for the first half. After the guided tour we were allowed to explore the castle. Lots of very interesting history surrounding the castle.",
          "Went to the organised Easter activities at King John\u2019s Castle on a beautiful sunny day that highlighted the city at that its best. There was lots of entertainment and side shows as well as a tour of the castle. The views from the top of the castle were just spectacular and worth",
          "The Castle tells the history of Limerick. It is multi-sensory. there are tasks for children and games to help them remember the story. It is a lot of walking. Gift shop is typical. Pictures from the ramparts are great. It is self guided.",
          "The castle is very well preserved, especially considering that two walls have been demolished over the centuries. Tourists are given free rein of the place after a very informative museum visit, including archeological excavations of layers of historical siege warfare.",
          "There are definitely several castles in Ireland. This castle tour was very informative and offered some nice views of the river Shannon from the towers.",
          "During a week long trip to Ireland we were in Limerick primarily to visit the birthplace of our grandfather. The castle was interesting but not mind blowing. It is best viewed from the other side of the river Shannon. Lack of energy stopped us from climbing to the top. Within",
          "Of all the castles we visited (5 this trip) this one was by far the best! Modern exhibits and lots to see and learn. Perfect for all ages. Worth the entry fee. Give yourselves at least 90 minutes to take it all in.",
          "We were in Limerick for the Riverfest and walked over the King John\u2019s Castle. We took the tour and enjoyed seeing the inside of a great old relic. On the River Shannon and well preserved. We ate st the Hook and Ladder after, a very nice lunch.",
          "We visited this castle early in the morning , so there were no various events as we were told that occur later on. On the outside the castle seems not even touched by time, seems to \u201cstrengthen\u201d by the neighboring river Shannon and its walls and towers are very well preserved.",
          "We had a great sunny day for the visit. The castle is well kept and full of information regarding the castle.",
          "The whole experience was great very friendly staff and you can just walk around at your own pace and enjoy the history the first part is very informative and sets you up for entering the castle",
          "A truly stunning castle. The gift shop is attached to a coffee shop which is very large and has a ton of material. Coffee was pretty good. Depending on the time you arrive, there may be actors and actresses acting the part of medieval times. We arrived slightly late so missed",
          "This was a great experience. After a brief informational walk thru, you get to see a real castle , and how things were back in the day. I found this to be the best of all the castles we visited.",
          "Admittedly, we booked this to kill time while our hotel room was being prepped. After a long flight from the states, this self guided tour was very user friendly. We enjoyed the outside actual castle park much more than the interactive inside portion (think watch videos).",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the way in which the history of this castle was presented. Excellent videos popped up at various points and added a real charm to the exhibits. We found ourselves looking forward to what we would find around the next bend. The designers of the exhibits can",
          "We decided to just do the river-side walk and simply view the castle from that and the bridges. We are a bit castled out after several visits to England, Scotland and Wales so decided the walk would be more interesting. Can highly recommend doing that if you have had your fill",
          "We loved visiting the castle, very informative and the views were stunning. Parking was easy and free which was nice",
          "Wonderfully outlined exhibition spaces. Very interactive (although a few of the interactives didn\u2019t work - such as the cannon ball and model town that lights up depending on what area you\u2019re interested in), and accessible to all abilities and ages. Loved the exposed foundation",
          "Went here last December with the family. We were told upon arrival that our appt with Santa was running at least an hour behind schedule. We kindly offered to go away, get something to eat and return in an hour. What they didn't tell us was that everything else would be",
          "Great place to visit if you happen to visit Limerick City it's a must see, I would also recommend the cinema about Limerick City's History",
          "Interesting but overload of history for me. Only part of a tula castle was the foundations! Enjoyed it, worth a visit whilst in Limerick",
          "Spent an afternoon here learning about how Limerick came to be. Very interesting. A must see in Limerick.",
          "How do you get in?? LOL we walked along the river where the arrow pointed to the castle, couldn't find the way in for love nor money LOL",
          "Very interesting reading about all the history of Ireland. Felt like I took a semester of Irish History by the time we were finished. Great views of the city and river",
          "Great interactive information at start of tour. Very informative, great to learn more about history. Very suitable for children, very enjoyable.",
          "If you are in town this is worth a stop and and a 30 to 49 minute visit. Some well presented history. The self guided tour was a tad disjointed but at the end we probably walked away better informed than when we stated. Very large tourist trap on the way out. Average coffee.",
          "I was very surprised by the castle. The staff was very attentive and the exhibit was very well prepared.",
          "I was not impressed with this castle. There is not much too it and the displays were lacking. It is right downtown so easily accessible, but if you are in Ireland to see some castles this is not the one. Many more that are better.",
          "The castle has a long history which was well displayed and interesting good value and worth a visit for an insight to the history of the region",
          "Just the right amount of information and display. Young children thoroughly entertained with the interactive displays.",
          "Do a self-guided walking tour around the medieval quarter- really interesting and beautiful area with well-marked signs to follow.",
          "Very interactive tour through a large castle. Tour starts off with an extensive history of the castle. Throughout the tour their are videoed actors who play the part of historical people of the castle. There are some interactive displays such as building an arch and shooting",
          "We visited a number of castles on our Irish holiday and this was one of the most kid friendly and entertaining. It has a great museum to go with it.",
          "Castle was what you would expect. Good experience if you enjoy the history of things $15 euro,s their are discount coupons if you look",
          "The ruins of the castle are fun and accessible to people with relative freedom of movement. But the museum is one of the better historical museums I have toured, rich with understandable explanations and timelines, and organized nicely.",
          "Lots of great fun and interactive bits in this, clean and not too long/short. Outside is the best bit with the towers and again, more interaction. Be careful on the steps in the towers but overall nice and fun, topped off with a lil tipple afterwards in Katie Dalys across from",
          "We visited King John's Castle in the middle of the first week in April. The castle has a couple of interactive videos displaying the a story of some of the residence of the castle - constable, mint, common soldier. I think there were a couple of others. Those were",
          "The castle itself is ok but the presentation they\u2019ve put together is fabulous. Many interactive stations and video displays are presented that bring the castle and area history to life. The only distraction is the building that houses the presentation and gift shop.",
          "This wasn't in our travel guide, but was recommended by locals. We enjoyed the history and interactive portions of the tour. We thought it was worth the visit.",
          "Once again a total fleecing of the tourists without any regard. I have read the responses from management on negative reviews and they say they will take on board and improve. Obviously never happened. The historic displays are confusing, they seem to be very random with no",
          "Really cool medieval castle in the heart of Limerick overlooking the river Shannon. It is really steeped in history. We spent about 4 hours here and learned so much about sieges and Irish history. Great for both families and adults. We had a ten and fifteen year d with us and",
          "The Castle is full of History not just for Limerick, but for Ireland. We took our time going thru the museum and the castle. Then we walked over to the Church, not a far walk.",
          "The castle is situated in a busy spot (which may be why King John built it there in the first place) so if you are travelling by car, plan ahead. We found parking on the other side of the river. There's an admission charge.",
          "Had a few hours to spare and came across the castle as we drove to the hotel from Thomond Park. Hadn\u2019t heard about the castle before despite its size! Pleasantly surprised that the castle and visitors centre were well worth stopping off for. Interactive museum, and areas of",
          "King John's Castle is impressive, informative and awe-inspiring. Take your time strolling through on a self-guided tour. Learn the history of the castle and immerse yourself in the interactive displays. Great for all ages. Wonderful location on the Shannon. A hands-on history",
          "One of the largest and best preserved castles in Ireland. Excellent location by th River Shannon. Well worth a visit.",
          "We liked this one the best out of the three castles we visited in Ireland. The tour is self-guided and there are ruins to see outside - bring your umbrella if there is rain. There are steps to climb, so be mindful of that - it is worth climbing to the towers to look out and",
          "Wow! Too much of history about King John and his ways of life. Over look the river Limerick. Never miss it.",
          "A fun, informative and interactive visit that is both entertaining and educational. Finally understand the origins of the term \"undermine\"!",
          "Before you visit the castle there is a historical summary of what happened in the area which can be seen on four television monitors Once you have viewed these proceed to the castle. Climb to the top to see the amazing views of the river and surrounding area. The rest of the",
          "Self guided tour of King James Castle was worth the time if your interested in history. Wonder views of Limerick making fantastic picture opts!!",
          "For any visitor to Ireland and for Irish people themselves the castle visit gives a great display both by way of film and billboards of the history of the castle, Limerick and Ireland. It can take up to 2 hours to take in the experience and learn about the struggles of Ireland",
          "I am living in limerick all my life and didn't visit this castle until I was an adult with my own kids and what a treat couldn't recommend this place highly enough the tour is fantastic and if you can get there on a good day the views up the river are spectacular",
          "I have lived 30mins from King Johns Castle for the past 18 years and only visited the place a couple of days ago for something to do while a friend was over visiting. All I can say is that its A shame it took me so long! It was a great way to spend an afternoon. Very",
          "This was a very interesting stop. There is a lot of history going way back and presented well. Our only problem was the fog rolled in very quickly after our arrival.",
          "Spent an afternoon here with the family, lots to see and do. Online price was higher than what we paid in the door.",
          "We stopped at this castle on our way to the Cliffs of Moher. They had a nice informational setup with videos. The castle itself had some amazing views of the city. It was hard to enjoy because the rain and wind were lashing.",
          "Such a historic site, there is an opportunity to take your time to see the entire castles. The children loved the courtyard and being able to try on the different types of knight gear. There was even a couple there getting their wedding photographs done. It was fantastic.",
          "After doing many castle tours, I didn\u2019t expect much from king johns castle but I was very wrong. The effort that has been put into the exhibitions is exceptional and it is extremely interactive and has incredible views. Well worth traveling to see!",
          "Well preserved castle, great tour and explains about the jacobite rising and the people of limericks involment in it, extremely informative tour",
          "Another reviewer called King Johns \u201caccessible\u201d and I definitely agree. Much of this tour can accessed by people with mobility issues. There are a few places, like the towers, which are not, but there had definitely been an effort to make the facility as accessible as possible.",
          "It's worth mentioning that not very much of the castle itself survives, but the attraction as a whole is absolutely worth the visit (and definitely recommended for children). Before reaching the castle grounds you are guided through an interactive history of Limerick and the",
          "Another castle that my son and I ticked off our list during our Irish road trip, I didn't know what to expect of King Jonh's Castle but I was pleasantly surprised. The interactive display before you enter the castle was good and even well-received by my then four-year-old. The",

          "Paid the entrance fee, and went through the exhibition, there is TONS of information in here, if you were a student doing a paper or a thesis on the castle, you'd get everything you need here! A lot of it seems geared towards schools, being able to touch and feel things. The",
          "When I recall that King John was in this very nice castle only once, I remember how he hated Ireland and loved England. It is a wonderful creation and I spent a great deal of time enjoying history. The View across the river is spectacular.",
          "Loved our visit to St Johns Castle. Great tourist stop. Well worth a visit. A lot of thought has gone into the layout of it all. Would highly recommend a visit.",
          "One of the best castle tours I\u2019ve done with the exception of a couple things. First off we loved the video people talks and some of the hands on exhibits. What we didn\u2019t like was some were broken or missing pieces and need to be fixed or replaced. No game pieces, no rocks to dig",
          "We did walk round and get pictures but the castle itself was closed for the holidays. We love castles and this is one of the grandest we have seen, Would have liked to gone inside. Another tidbit is right down the street is the Bridge Tower which is now a residence.",
          "Travelled from Galway by bus to see Limerick and King John\u2019s Castle. A very worthwhile trip! The gorgeous castle is in great shape and dates from the time of King John and Richard the Lionhearted of Crusades fame. A great stroll on a sunny fall.day with lots of history and",

          "Shannon Heritage should really be ashamed of the disaster that is the Christmas experience at King John\u2019s. The winter wonderland in the courtyard consists of a few trees with lights and a sad old crib. Everything seems very thrown together and while some of the staff really",
          "Just returned from Santa visit at King John\u2019s Castle. Absolutely shambolic! Nothing Christmasy or magical about the experience at all. Hardly any decorations around the place and no music to create a festive atmosphere Apart from Santa himself, who was very pleasant, the staff",
          "King John's Castle is more than just a historic site. The exhibits are a great way to learn about Irish history. I could have easily spent more hours looking at them as they were both extensive and fun. Also, I appreciated the free parking lot across the street and the nominal",

          "The tour i guess is informative but I am not sure if was worth going to see. The views are worth it and is obviously old hence not wheelchair accessible.",
          "I was surprised on how many times this castle changed hands throughout its history. In addition, it is conveniently located to other historical venues, and really nice coffee shops and pubs. The pastries they have on site are good as well. Lots of options!",
          "There is not alot to see for the price. There is history of the city and some information about life in Limerick at the time. A good view of Limerick from the tower, but not much else going on in November.",
          "The castle is beautifully presented with a range of interactive facilities. The undercroft is interesting, but the above ground buildings excellent.",
          "Visited St Johns catle yesterday. Mid November and it was so good and so enjoyable. Recommend highly.",
          "We went with our family of 3 children aged between 4 and 10, and enjoyed the interactive displays and the informative videos. There was plenty of child-friendly activities, with a sheet of quizzes and object searches keeping the younger 2 busy. The castle itself is not as large",
          "Great place to learn about Ireland's struggle against other countries and the blood that was shed to remain independent until the bitter end. The castle itself has actors in period costume roaming around adding to the authenticity of the site. The foundation of the castle is",

          "Short on time and funds, we nearly passed on King John's Castle. But we wandered into the visitor center and found the upper level to have a wealth of interesting information and history, as well as a great view into the castle courtyard. You don't have to pay admission to",
          "Well worth the visit. Very informative both historically and scientifically. Be prepared to walk up very steep and narrow stairs inside the actual castle. Not for the mobility challenged visitor.",
          "This castle was build by the famous King John of the story of Robin Hood, nicely preserved and the tour is so wonderfull. You can even wear some uniform of the time. The view from the castle is so amazing. A muist.",

          "The first view of the Castle was awesome but after you wandered around the perimeter, the stark contrast of the modern that was brilliantly blended into the front was stunning and unexpected. With the Shannon River sparkling as the background and the vista of small shops",
          "Good enough but a little expensive as there isn't really anything else to do around the area especially if it's raining.",
          "This castle was full of surprises. We enjoyed stepping back into history for a full tour. It's a great tour to learn more about history and various castles. The museum was interesting and definitely worth the money in our opinion.",
          "If in Limerick it is worth a visit as it\u2019s one of the few remaining castles still standing in Ireland and Europe.also a great place for concerts",
          "For an insight on Norman Ireland a visit to King John\u2019s Castle ia a must. It has been beautifully restored and the story telling is excellent. The views from the turrets are worth a visit alone.",
          "We spent about 1 1/2 hours going round, reading about the castle in relation to Irish history, about which we knew little (not having been taught much about it at school in England). The interactive displays were good, as were the short videos. There are not many artefacts,",
          "Could not gain entrance from where we were so looked around other buildings in the area. It's close to the Thomond Bridge and Shannon River. Worth a visit and heard that it's interesting once inside.",
          "Be prepared to watch videos, listen to near holograms and learn a lot about Irish and European history. Well presented and documented. Views from the top of the castle are spectacular. Nice gift shop to browse after the self guided tour around the castle. Robin Hood beware.",
          "This is really a fantastic place to visit.The castle is mostly intact and the way the history is displayed in the museum is just phenomenal. Some parts are outside, so I'd advise to bring a waterproof jacket if the weather looks bad or cold. One part I really appreciated is that",
          "This castle is in really good shape and very comparable to CarrickFergus castle. They have a good gift shop for special gifts to take home with you. I really enjoyed the ability to sense what it must have been like to live back then. Well done facility with lots of",
          "They say that Vikings occupied the site in AD 922, but the local clans eventually drove them out. The present castle was completed in AD 1210. It is a magnificent example of a Norman castle, and it's particularly attractive up against the flowing River Shannon. We viewed King",
          "This was the best museum of this type that we have visited in our travels. The interpretive center was very well done and the castle itself is in excellent condition. There are a number of activities suitable for children so it is an experience that everyone can enjoy. I would",
          "Fairly large castle that tells the story of Limerick for the period when the castle was built. Very well done with artifacts and videos showing what life was like in those days. Good attraction for kids. All in all an enjoyable visit.",
          "Very informative and interestingly laid out attraction. It was good to see video of characters from history and see artifacts that were used. So much to see for all ages. Telling Irish history from pre-Viking times.",
          "We easily spend 2h in the castle, maybe the more. It's very full, with videos, commentaries, a lot of reading etc... there is a lot to see and learn. Small guide flyers are available in a lot of languages if needed.",
          "Very good historical information. Interactive stations for adults and kids. Still doing renos on and around the building. Worth a visit.",
          "The story of the King John's Castle was presented using a variety of tools, including short films, reproduction tools, reenactors, and pictorial representations, in the museum area. The castle towers were open to visitors, and provided magnificent views of the river and town.",
          "Part exhibits and part self-guided tour this visit gives great overview of Viking, Roman, French, and British history and how all are woven together to form tapestry of Europe. All battles were about land and family power ( aren\u2019t they all!). Chilling view of what people did to",
          "My visit to this castle was partly on a guided tour and partly on my own. The history of the castle was very interesting. Highly recommended",
          "A really interesting self guided tour. A lot of effort has gone into the exhibits and interactive displays. The videos were short and informative and kept my attention well. You must climb up all the stairs and make the most of the fantastic views of the city and of the River",
          "There is a great interactive exhibit that you go through before entering the castle which made the castle that much more interesting. This is a must see if visiting Limerick.",
          "We went to many castles on our ireland trip and this was by far the most disappointing. The museum part with all the information was cluttered, and a lot of the interactive panels didn\u2019t work. There was no one around in the museum to explain anything or ask questions. The",
          "Some would say, \u201cABC\u201d, another bloody church, but St. John\u2019s is a masterpiece. Stained glass windows, marvelously painted ceilings, a pipe organ. Take the time to see this jewel on the inside, not just driving by.",
          "We visited on a Sunday morning and were impressed with this stop. I see some reviews indicating it's for kids. Maybe I am a kid at heart but I think all ages would enjoy this stop, and frankly it was filled with adults enjoying the displays. There is a fee and it wasn't",
          "The museum was wonderful and educational on the history of Ireland. Great little shop. This castle must be visited on your trip.",
          "This was our first time to visit this castle. We weren\u2019t sure what to expect. There was free parking near the castle, and the entire self paced tour took us a few hours. Plenty of interactive features, informative videos, and we noticed quite a few features designed",
          "Perhaps it was just a bad day, but when we went to the visitor centre for a snack and drink, we were sadly disappointed. At 12:45 they had run out of virtually all food, but trying to get served at the counter was a real hassle. We cannot comment on the quality of food for",
          "The buildings are there... amongst littered streets, locked gates and graffiti... one can only ask what happened here? It's a shocking display of unkempt heritage.",
          "The museum bit is very informative with plenty of facts to keep you there for ages. Then you go to the main open bit of the castle which is lovely and well kept. The best bit though are the fantastic views of Limerick from the very top of the tower. Worth the climb!",
          "Visited King John\u2019s Castle for the first time in years. The visitor section and historic displays are very interesting and give a great overview of historic Limerick. The castle displays themselves are ok but not overly impressive. For the price you\u2019re charged it\u2019s excessive.",
          "Possibly the most history i've learned about my own country in one place! Everything from the arrival of the Vikings and Normans to the pesky English :) right up to our disgraceful Civil war. An entire days worth of fun.",
          "We really liked our visit and the mix of interactive museum and hands on, walk through castle. The view from the castle of the city is excellent and this stop made for some terrific photos. We stopped for coffee and cheesecake at the cafe afterward which was also very good.",
          "We spent lovely afternoon here roaming around the visitors centre learning about the history of the castle. Very informative and well laid out. Afterwards we were free to roam the castle which is very impressive. I think it would be much more fun with some interactive",
          "We visited the cafe last Saturday. Omg the service firstly was terrible. The two girls on duty couldn't possibly have been slower. The sandwiches and ciabatta were prepared and wrapped in cling film and left sitting there. We ordered soup and they didn't even have hot soup it",
          "Compared to some of the other castles visited this was more of a museum with videos and displays then an actual historical castle..very disappointing",
          "Very good, kids love going there. Always we are taking our visitors there. After few times you kind of board as nothing is new or happening there.",
          "King John's Castle is a very good looking building. It looks like a castle should. There is ample parking space near the castle and good information on its role in Irish history. To get a really good view, walk over the main bridge over the Shannon in central Limerick. You",
          "I love castles but this might be the best one I\u2019ve seen yet, for a couple of reasons. The first is that there is a big gallery before you go into the main part of the castle that is LOADED with historical information, artifacts and visual displays. The second is that the towers",
          "Take your time to view the information displays on Irish history before you go to see the castle. It is modern, entertaining and informative. Understanding Irish history can be complex, this exhibit explains the fascinating web of intrigue in medieval Irish politics and the dire",
          "Another major tourist stop, but this one has been done very well. The audiovisual and interactive portions are very good, interesting but not too heavy on names & dates. The castle itself has a prime position on the Shannon, the views from the towers are spectacular.",
          "I love visiting castles and King John's castle in Limerick didn't disappoint! A lot of investment had obviously gone into the interpretation which was very good - different areas in the castle which had actors portrayed on large screens playing certain characters associated",
          "It's well worth a visit to this Castle, even just for the fantastic views from the top of the tower. You need a bit of time here to explore. The heritage centre is excellent and I think children would also like it. There is a self-explanatory detailed history of the tower,",
          "On tour, amazing piece of history. Visited with my daughter. The history is presented in a very good manner. Family friendly for sure. Loved it. Puts things in a truly different perspective.",
          "It\u2019s one of the main attractions of Limerick and gives an insight about the history and the bridge behind it has a breathtaking view too. There\u2019s eateries just outside where you can get freshly baked bread.",
          "I had previously visited King John's Castle in 1996, and the changes are outstanding. Much more of the castle is open to climb around and explore--kids will love it, as they will the exhibits that specifically appeal to them, such as firing air cannons, dressing up as knights",
          "My young boys enjoyed the hands on stuff in the court yard area. The scavenger hunt for them also kept them occupied while the adults enjoyed the informative displays. There is free parking across the road from the castle. Watching many people (including myself) we were confused",
          "Having read some of the reviews I was concerned about paying the entrance fee, but have to say it was a fair price for the attraction with 2 adults and two teenage children getting entry for approx 36 Euro's. On entry you are taken through a series of rooms which explain the",
          "Castle is quite interactive and first part is very informative with short movies, interesting fact/information boards. Everything set up really well for kids and adults. 'Role play' outside where castle staff dress as people from that period. Very nice outing and would go",
          "Obviously a visit to any mediaeval city isn't complete without a visit to the castle, and so I visited Limerick castle. \u20ac13 entry for an adult is quite pricy in the great realms of things. The castle consists of a few information boards and some reconstructions upon entering,",
          "We did not get in the castle since it was close, but the vies form outside are very nice. It looks like inside it's not much to visit from the original castle.",
          "This castle is different from others we went to as it definitely is a military fortress more than the stereotypical castles. They have a museum section loaded with history and hands-on activities for kids (adults enjoyed too) before you walk the grounds. Very neat place!!!",
          "I visited by myself on a Sunday afternoon, and it was a good way to spend a quite afternoon. The day was a bit rainy, so the castle wasn't over-crowded. The exhibits before getting into the castle were very interesting - the entrance building shows the history of the area and",
          "The tour is very good. It\u2019s self guided but it\u2019s very well explained. There are lots of little activities which makes it more fun and interesting for young children to learn about the history of the castle. The one thing I would say is that it\u2019s not very accessible for disabled",
          "We loved this Castle. It has been updated with new techno exhibitions. The exhibitions invoke a time travel experience. Don't miss it. The underground mines and tunnels were very interesting.",
          "We were super excited to visit this castle and it was only a short walk from our hotel. Upon paying the \u20ac13 per person fee we entered the \u201cmuseum\u201d part of the castle. While I appreciate the technology they used in this part we were very underwhelmed. After walking through the",
          "The castle is large and mostly restored, filled with the history of Ireland from before the Vikings. Historical actors help explain some of the activities that went on at the time of King John and other areas have videos where recorded reenactors explain what occurred in town,",
          "The Museum, and the Castle itself, and locall churches and streets all inform and entertain. excellent.",
          "This was a nice stop if you happen to be in Limerick. There is a lot of reading about the history. If you climb to the top of one of towers you get good views of the city. The interactive videos were pretty cool.",
          "This castle has a great museum that takes you through the history of the castle and region. Very well laid out and learned a lot. The actual castle is pretty cool and you must climb up the stairs to the top portion is one of the towers. Fantastic view of Limerick and the",
          "King John\u2019 Castle is within easy walking distance of the Limerick city centre. The exhibitions within the castle precinct are very well done, informative and interesting, and detail a broader view of the history of Ireland. Climbing the towers was a little tricky on a crowded",
          "This old castle is very interesting because of the very good interactive multimedia display explaining the history of Ireland, the construction of the castle and the Limerick area. The castle itself doesn't have much to show.",
          "Really fun historical tour! Great views from the top of the castle and fun to explore. Perfect for children and adults. What\u2019s better than touching a real castle hundreds of years old?",
          "I have to commend those who brought life back into the castle with the interactive media and designated tour paths. It was a good tour but not much more. It tied elements of forgotten history back together. I did expect that there would be a greater presence of guides on the",
          "If you\u2019re interested in history I really recommend a visit here. There is a charge to get in but worth it in my view, the castle is quite large and it\u2019s entire almost 1000 year history is covered in the various exhibits. There are exhibits specially designed for educating and",
          "We visited the castle as a couple and didn't spend as much time there as we could have because didn't find so many things during the 'tour' that interesting. I believe that for children there is plenty of activities and exciting things to see. Wouldn't visit again for 9,5\u20ac",
          "What a wonderful castle to enjoy learning in a fun and interactive way. Children from 3 to 67 years old enjoy this castle and could all become involved. Well done",
          "Multimedia exhibition is quite interesting but nothing interesting is going on courtyard. Nice view from the top of the castle but that's it.",
          "I really enjoyed the museum. The historical data they provided was really intriguing and they tried to make it interactive to engage younger children as well. Much of the castle has been destroyed, it is more of an archaeological site inside, but you can see evidence of the",
          "The castle and attached museum are really well organized and informative. The pre-castle area gives a great historical timeline of the castle and the events and conflicts. The excavated tunnels showed the lengths and strategies used during conflicts. The main castle is well",
          "Spent a couple of hours here with my wife on August bank holiday Monday. A great slice of Irish history with interactive displays for kids of all ages. Learn about the siege, those involved and the outcome together with other events that played out at the castle and nearby.",
          "Spend a very enjoyable 4 hours in the castle with my family of four. The visit starts in a education center with multiple displays, videos, exhibits and information boards explaining the history of the castle. My wife and I enjoyed the detailed history and explanation of who",
          "Beautiful castle but only the structure is left. I have visited some castles in Europe where everything is still in tact and they re-created the living quarters with period furniture, etc. This castle is not like thst, it's more like the ruins of the castle. With that said, it's",
          "This is a must see historical and educational center in Limerick. Restored as an attraction in at the beginning of this centuryafter years of misuse in the mid twentieth century. (Low income housing was built and occupied in the main courtyard!) More recent renovations have an",
          "This isn\u2019t just a castle fortress, it is a full museum with so many interactive areas for kids and adults alike. We enjoyed learning the history of Ireland while getting to try on medieval clothing, playing with swords, archery and the views are unbelievable. Gorgeous place and",

          "Check online options for ticket booking. Lovely view of the city from the tower. You can enjoy some treats in the cafe and gift shop",
          "A good interactive place to visit. Lots of informative video clips and drawers to look into to discover more about Ireland\u2019s past. The highlight was when we were able to climb to the top of the tower and look out across limerick and take some good photos. The only annoying thing",
          "We visted King John's Castle today. This Castle is well preserved. It takes you back in 800 years of history. This is a must see when in Limerick as it is a good starting point before you visit any of the other Castles in the area.",
          "The introductory section reviews the history of the castle, mostly presented as panels to read. This was well done, and there were some audio-visual presentations, but not all of them were working. The next part was touring the castle (mostly a court yard with ruins), was",
          "Lots of beautifully presented history. Exceptionally well maintained and offers a great insight to the surrounding area. At the top of the tower ( you have to climb some steep stairs) the view is fantastic. We had a 9 year old and a 25 year old with us and they really enjoyed",
          "King John's Castle was a surprise, rather than your usual museum with glass cabinets, it offered opportunities to see, touch and feel the past. We spent almost 3 hrs wandering around the exhibits and climbing the castle walls, and then finished with 2 lovely bowls of soup in",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed this visit! This was the most informative castle of all we visited during our Irish road trip. Learned a lot about Irish history as well as the history of this castle specifically. Lots of reading, which may not appeal to all. But there are videos",
          "Great visit. Teenagers went at their pace and we adults at ours. Interactive exhibits and live people to fence and juggle with. Great views of the city and all at a reasonable price. We all enjoyed ourselves!",
          "My partner and I visited the castle because I had never been. We enjoyed our morning here, we both found it very interesting, if you're into history it's great, and the view from the top of the tower is fab. You could spend 2+ hours here, if you wanted to take it easy and see",
          "Fascinating, allow plenty of time to walk around. Coffee in cafe awful. Loved the photographic progression of the restoration",

          "Have been there twice, and it is worth the price of admission. Even mentions Robin Hood briefly. It is missing something, I think a guided tour, but is worthwhile when in Ireland.",
          "Fantastic venue for a concert - it really exceeded my expectations. Having a concert in a castle is just a fab setting. Entrance in was quick - no queuing for a drink. Brilliant night !",
          "Very pleasantly surprised, with time to kill before a flight home this was our go to and we weren\u2019t left disappointed. Prices where more than advertised online, however still worth the money. A great blend of modern and historical architecture. Facilities are good, well signed",
          "After being advised not to visit this castle, we were incredibly pleasantly surprised. Lots to do, see and read and if you love Irish and English history - this will tick all of your boxes. You can spend a good 2 hours exploring this historic space.",

          "Starting with the interpretatve centre, a rain proof activity, depending on the time of year, it takes you through the various stages in the history early times of the castle. As you proceed, there are different dioramas, models and displays as well as a small play area and",

          "My 15 year old son and I visited King John\u2019s Castle and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves in the exhibit portion that precedes entering the castle grounds as well as walking the castle grounds themselves. It was really something to be able to explore the castle grounds so freely,",
          "We were on a walking tour and did not enter the castle. The castle has a very stern profile against the Limerick skyline and begs to be explored, the very name 'King John', of Magna Carta fame, conjures up intrigue of all kinds. Although we didn't have the pleasure we will save",

          "I had a lovely experience at King John's Castle, Limerick. I paid \u20ac9.50 for my entrance ticket (over 65) and began my tour. The walk through the exhibition/historic display was well signposted. It was very enjoyable and brought back to me my studies of Irish history (I was",

          "Cool experience. You can see all of the history, there was a place to use old shields and other stuff and take pics, etc....it was a good time, cool courtyard and decent view from the top.",
          "We were quite upset by the very ugly modifications made to the original structure. If the same energy used to design some of the displays, which were nice- if a little worse for wear, were put into the safety modifications- it would have been a much better experience. They are",
          "This castle has well prepared museum like exhibits. The interior is really a modern museum not a castle. The exhibits & videos are well done but unless you love standing & reading sign after sign it is WAY too much reading. I prefer an animated guide that tells me the story.",
          "We did not do too much research into what we wanted to visit when we got to Ireland. Our first day was in Limerick and this was our first stop. It is a castle and obviously stands out from the street which is why we went to it. It was a cool castle with a big open courtyard that",

          "You've probably heard of King John. He's the Baddie that Robin Hood and his Merrie Men were upset about. He's the guy who put his name on the Magna Carta. And he's the King who, in 1210, ordered that this castle be built. King John reigned from 1199 to 1216, but ironically",

          "Disappointed with King Johns Castle. Was expecting more of a grand castle but really its a Fort. There are no Grand halls or rooms to view just a walled open area and a strange glass protrusion at the front. Yes the interactive area is very informative about the history and the",

          "We stopped in on a drizzly day in May there were no crowds which was nice the tour is nice the history before the castle proper was well laod out and worth the price of admission on its own. The castle was intersting and fun we spent about an hour and a half but rushed a little",
          "This place is definitely a must when you are in Limerick. History very well explained, interesting and educational. View from a tower is amazing and I recommend to go on it. You will probably need around 2 hours to go all around the castle. Only thing that I was missing there",
          "Very complete and varied displays and presentations - video, interactive, actors... Appropriate for all ages. Very worth the time and money.",
          "Got a late start to our day so limited to one journey this trip through Limerick. First, the price is spot on for different categories. Second, they have set it up for children, elementary (age 8-15), will enjoy both education and Interactive posing, firing cannons, open",
          "The museum did a good job of explaining the history behind the castle. You could look down into the old footings and walls under the existing site. Within the castle walls, you can climb the stairs into the tower. Note, if you have large feet, you might find this challenging.",
          "We were in Ireland on a 4 day coaxch tour and as luck would have it our short visit to Limerick was on a public holiday with many places either shut or only open on restricted hours. We were able to walk along the riverside and see the castle from a couple of external vantage",
          "Had a great afternoon walking round this castle. Each exhibit had just enough information to make it interesting which made you want to move onto the next stage. There were about 4 videos giving you the chance to hear rather than read about the history of the castle. After going",
          "The castle itself is very interesting and the way the exhibits are done using audio visual presentations really adds to the experience.",
          "I have visited countless castles throughout Europe. This was hands down the best laid out and organized. If there on a clear day climb to the top!! Amazing views!!",
          "I thought it would be difficult to find the castle but as it's right on the banks of the river Shannon and as you get fairly near it, it becomes obvious and the signs get better. There is a free car park just 3 minutes walk away. We found it very easily particularly as we",
          "A very relaxing tour of the castle. Staff were really helpful answering our questions. The route through the castle was well laid out and quite interesting exhibits. Nice restaurant for a good cup or coffee and pastry. A definite must see!",
          "thought the admission was a bit expensive, for the price there wasn't a whole lot to see, could do with reducing admission price or adding more to see in the castle.",
          "Cool placed to go to for occasional concerts they have on. There is a lovely pub called Katie Daly's across the street from it, nice starting point, or the Locke Bar/ Curraghgower are nearby pubs that are walking distance. In the castle you walk through the shop part- and they",
          "Very good information displays , films and interactive features giving a history of the castle and its inhabitants. I learnt a lot.

          "There's no doubt this is a site which is historically important but the castle is mostly rubble. I liked it but for the cost of admission, there was very little of the castle left to see. The place does its best to bring the story to life but I prefer the structures to be",

          "The main reason we stopped at King John's Castle is that one of the people in our group was John, and how could we skip it when we were so close. How lucky we were! The exhibit was easy very informative and well presented. Our group was all adults, but we noticed that",
          "King John\u2019s Castle is a stop on most Limerick tours and understandably so. The castle is part original structure, museum with interactive displays which present the history of the area and cafe/gift shop. The exhibits will delight any person interested in history. You have the",

          "Nice visit, though our four year old ran through most of it without allowing us to read much. He loved the cannons that shoot balls as an activity for showing information about the sieges. I liked the video guides which gave glimpses into the lives of those who worked and lived",
          "Overall great experience, lots of information and all very interesting! A few of the interactive pieces of the exhibit were not working, but there was so much other information and pieces to look at that it did not detract from the experience. The physical remains of the castle",
          "King John\u2019s castle sits on the banks of the river Shannon - on the opposite bank is JJ Bowles pub - the oldest pub in Limerick. The castle has a very good interactive exhibit which tells the history of the castle from the 12th century.",
          "We visited on a cold and wet afternoon, though by the time the visit ended the sun was out. The entry price is fairly steep. On entering there are a series of exhibitions that are jumbled and unclear and in terms of relevance to this particular castle seem to test the",

          "We were getting disappointed at seeing so many castles in Ireland & never getting past the walls! We were so happy to come here and were not disappointed. It was about 22.50 Euros ($37 Cdn) for entrance for my daughter & we were there for almost 2 hours. It wasn't too bust as it",
          "As a student of military history & casual afficianado of John Ford films, this was a place I had to investigate. Incredible example of medieval masonry fortifications. The site is under continuing development. Very active site & very worth the look-see. Loved it.",
          "We were driving throughout Ireland and stumbled upon this gem. It was informative, fascinating, and enjoyable.",

          "This is quite a complete castle in terms of its defences and there are interactive exhibits explaining the history of both the castle and the city of Limerick. Interesting and big enough to stroll around for an hour or two although can be done much quicker.",

While I do have to agree with the people who were shocked, I can also say that it was necessary for us to find a place to stop for the night while",

King John's Castle is by no means the grandest castle out there, but the history, battles, and interactive presentations make it truly enjoyable. Plus, you can make your way up to the very top of the ramparts for an awesome view of Limerick!",
          "Waste of money! When signing up you must pick a time so we naturally assumed that we would be getting a guided tour but there is no guided tour and no audio tour. The information jumps from one era to the next without context of the \u2026",
          "Untold history. Well preserved",
          "Again, in Ireland, if you book tickets online in advance, you actually get a discount!  King John\u2019s offered a 10% discount for a total of \u20ac11.70 per adult.  Why, oh why do we get charged EXTRA for booking tickets online in America???\n\nSo, \u2026",
          "Really amazing castle nestled within the city.",
          "Self-Guided tour, and I booked tickets online for less than \u20ac12. Very informative and incredible views from the highest points they allow you to go. When I went there was almost nobody there, which I was kind of glad. Though I will say that \u2026",
          "We enjoyed this stop. 13\u20ac for adults. Interactive displays and videos abound. Great for tourists with children too. We enjoyed walking the grounds and even going under the castle. You can wander in and out of rooms too. After the tour, we enjoyed a pot of tea in the cafe to warm up.",
          "Great place, full of history.",
          "Very intersting !! They guide you through the 11th - 16th century of Irish and English history",

          "Really great from the inside. The view of the river was spectacular",

          "Very good historic location however it appeared to close at 4.30.",
          "This castle is a fabulous experience for all ages and all interest levels of history. From activities for the young\u2014build an arch with foam blocks\u2014to entertainment and interpretation for adults, each person in your group should find \u2026",
          "It\u2019s been the best part of 10 years since I visited. The castle, the self-guided tour and in particular the living history people are excellent.\n\nThere is much to read about the history or the castle and there are some interactive parts for \u2026",
          "Didn't feel anything different from the other castles in Ireland. Activities like long view on top and archery are good.",
          "Great place to visit if you're in that part of Ireland, it was fascinating to explore. Do note they close relatively early in the day so go earlier if you can. It was both educational and interesting, well worth the admission. Such history and wonder, it simply doesn't compare. Old world charm indeed.",

          "Actually really enjoyed the tour and some great interactive areas",
          "Great experience at this castle. Loved it's relation to the Robin Hood story. However, the history about what really happened to all the Irish people at the battles here is sad. I did appreciate the history and all the technology that went into this place. Great views from the tops of the castle.",
          "Interesting stop if you have a few hours to spare in Limerick.  The castle itself is wonderfully situated right on the river and pictures from across the river can be beautiful and dramatic.  An actual visit inside is really not needed - \u2026",
          "Great displays in museum and kids loved exploring the castle finding the clues on the treasure hunt",
          "King John\u2019s castle was built... it doesn\u2019t really matter, though 13th century sounds pretty impressive. What matters is how much fun is to visit it with children. They do some activities, they explore and study, they have fun, they imagine \u2026",
          "Really nice castle, it was really interesting.",
          "One of the best tourist attractions in Ireland. Everybody needs to go. We have been twice now and our young kids love it. Especially the canon balls. \nWe brought a friend who has lived in Limerick his entire life but yet had never been and he was blown away by it. Brilliant attraction for all weathers",
          "Very informative displays and videos on self guided tour. Castle sits right on the River Shannon and you are able to climb to the top of the tower so the view is stunning. \n\nFair warning, there are a fair amount of stairs and no elevators. \u2026",
          "This place was sooooo much bigger than we thought it would be. We only allotted two hours for the castle but wound up staying way more than that. It was fun having a bit of an interactive element in the museum, even period clothes you could \u2026",
          "A great place to visit. Lots to see and explore. The exhibition at the beginning of the self guided tour is very informative. It is great to get out on the rooftop walk, and see the views over Limerick.  King John's Castle is a must see!",
          "So much fun for all ages. It was educational and had great views!",
          "Great museum layout. Good to read and learn before entering the castle itself. Neat to be in so close to history.",
          "What a great castle to visit that is so different than all of the traditional Irish tower castles we visited.  We enjoyed the interactive displays and then touring the large walls, towers and courtyard that overlooks the intersection of \u2026",

          "Delightful Delores O Riordan Mural across from Castle. RIP Delores",
          "This is my first experience travelling to Europe. This was also my first experience visiting a building complex and village (now town) that is over a 1000 years old! This visit is off season and it was fantastic! No crowds with all the time \u2026",
          "Good museum that presents history in an interesting way. Some parts need maintenance and cleaning (dead pigeons in tower). A good bit of reading texts, I wouldn't recommend it for younger children.",
          "I'm a native of limerick and I have to say I only ever got around to visiting this castle earlier this year. Entrance fee was very reasonable and it's actually quite bigger then you think. Had a great time would definitely recommend",
          "The first portion of the castle was meant for school children. It reviews the historical facts of the place and has interactive displays. Once inside the castle grounds, the adventure begins. We were able to climb all the way to the top of the turrents of the castle to see a birds eye view of the whole city. Worth going.",
          "A great experience to witness the history of the world.  Ireland is an amazing country with many fantastic sites to see.",
          "One of my favorite castles to tour in Ireland! Very Informative and the way the displays and exhibits are integrated into the actual castle are amazing! The town of Limerick is also beautiful and full of things to do after the castle. The self guided tour took my wife and I around 2 hours and we took our time!",
          "A very in-depth and thorough look at Ireland's history amongst the store of King John's Castle. Set aside a few hours to walk through, read and watch all the displays. Definitely worth a visit if you're in Limerick.",
          "We visited on a rainy day so appreciated that a lot was indoors. The museum had good interactive exhibits & informative games, plus some good videos which were informative but not overly long. There's a lot to walk around outside too.",
          "It is fun to walk around old castles and see how things use to be.  everything was made by hand.  The craftsmanship and effort to build and maintain these structures is enormous.  it is great to be able to enjoy them.",
          "Fantastic experience, really enjoyed it",
          "This is the kind of castle you think of when you grow up watching fairy tales, except there were no King\u2019s quarters - there\u2019s a wall around a courtyard and several buildings built along the inside of the walls. Has watchtowers you can climb \u2026",
          "A worthwhile museum to visit and learn about the history of Ireland between the 9th and 19th centuries. The milestones are well recorded and presented in an interactive way en-route to visiting the castle itself.",
          "This was a nice castle! But you can see it was made into a commercial space before and then was transformed into a museum in a sense! It is a part of history but there are better castles in Ireland to visit that will give you a sense of \u2026",
          "Great day out for the young and the young at heart",
          "I recommend this place.",
          "This is a great place to stop on your way from Galway to Killarney.  Limerick is your typical Irish town with lots of places to see and a pub always nearby.  This castle was a nice surprise.  There is a lot to read if you like reading.. and a lot to see as well. King John was the bad guy you always heard about with Robin Hood.",
          "One of the best set up historical exhibitions, does an amazing job of conveying the history of the site before you walk through the castle itself. Highly recommended.",

          "What a beautiful castle!  We visited for a gig, and wow, what an experience!  The sound quality was perfect throughout.  As a music venue, it's so cool.  Stage, bands, sound were all excellent.  The toilets were great compared to those at \u2026",
          "Not especially imposing, but very rich of history and features a lot of multimedia exhibits that tell the stories. Kids will have a blast",
          "Average experience. Some nice games for kids, the exhibition is mainly reconstructed by videos or miniatures.",
          "If you want to understand the history of Limerick and some of Ireland then pay King John's castle a visit. For 8EU it's great value with a mixture of interactive and textual displays covering the bloody history of Limerick and the important \u2026",
          "It's an interesting place to visit and it shows the history of Limerick interactively but the actual historical part of the castle was in some bad shape with bird drippings in every room.",
          "Best castle that I've been to so far in Eire. Had a break half way through at the cafe and met the friendliest staff with the best mushroom soup.",
          "Great value for money. Friendly staff. Interesting and informative.",

          "Not worthy for the money they charges.",
          "Really enjoyed my visit. I think it was less lively than it might usually be with staffed \"animators\" as they call them. But the exhibits are good, it's a lot of fun to explore the castle and it's pretty family friend with lots of kids activities built into the exhibits.",
          "Restored castle and with amazing views at the top. Very detailed and interactive history brings the story to life. A must visit",
          "I do not see how this museum is so highly rated. countless parts of the exhibits were broken(drawers didn't open, buttons didn't work, speakers were busted, a cannon exhibit wasn't working).  or just missing. The only reason I'm rating it at 2 instead of 1  is the staff was super nice and helpful.",

In the courtyard there are allsorts from medieval times, gent dressed in period clothes playing a game with  children and a parent. You look over the River Shannon to see the other side of Limerick. Fascinating.",

          "I came into limerick knowing nothing about it. I decided to visit King John's Castle and left there knowing so much more about Irish heritage. It is a perfect place to take your kids to learn a bit more or to start off learning. The staff are really kind and happy to give out a helping hand.",

          "Fantastic find! Limerick was just a stop over on our journey but King Johns Castle was probably one of the best sites on our site seeing tour of Ireland. Well organized and interactive, truly fun for the whole family. Can not recommend this enough!!",
          "Nice place.",
          "Great views and some interesting insight into the history of Limerick. I'd say it's well-worth your time to pay a visit to the castle. Allow for an hour-and-a-half to two hours to get through everything at a leisurely pace.",
          "Went to the Santa experience this evening. Couldn't fault it. No queues.  Santa was really good and spent time chatting with the kids. Petting zoo very cute. After the reviews last week we were half dreading it but they have obviously upped their game. Lovely night.",

        "wiki": "Saint Mary's Cathedral, Limerick, is a cathedral of the Church of Ireland in Limerick, Ireland, which is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. It is in the ecclesiastical province of Dublin. Previously the cathedral of the Diocese of Limerick, Ardfert and Aghadoe, it is now the central cathedral in the United Dioceses of Limerick and Killaloe.\n\n\n== From the foundation to the Irish Reformation ==\n\nLimerick Cathedral (Saint Mary's) is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary and was founded in 1168 and is the oldest building in Limerick which is in use. It has the only complete set of misericords left in Ireland.In 1111, the Synod of R\u00e1th Breasail decided that \"Saint Mary's church\" would become the cathedral church of the Diocese of Limerick. According to tradition, Domnall M\u00f3r Ua Briain, the last King of Munster, founded the present cathedral on the site of his palace on King's Island in 1168. The palace had been built on the site of the Viking meeting place, or \"Thingmote\" \u2013 the Vikings' most westerly European stronghold. This had been the centre of government in the early medieval Viking city. Parts of the palace may be incorporated into the present structure of the cathedral, most prominently the great west door, which is claimed to have been the original main entrance to the royal palace. The west door is now only used on ceremonial occasions. The bishops of Limerick have for centuries knocked on this door and entered by it as part of their installation ceremony. According to tradition, during the many sieges of Limerick the defenders of the city used the stones around the west door to sharpen their swords and arrows, and the marks they made in the stonework can be seen there today.The tower of Saint Mary's Cathedral was added in the 14th century. It rises to 120 feet (36.58 meters), containing a peal of 8 bells, of which 6 were cast by John Taylor & Co, Loughborough, and 2 cast in Whitechapel, London. The tower also contains a stationary service bell, which can be rung from the ground floor.\n\n\n== Notable burials ==\n\nThe cathedral graveyard contains many graves and tombs of notable people. The physician Samuel Crumpe is buried in the graveyard near the great west door. Prince Milo of Montenegro, Frances Condell (first woman Mayor of Limerick) and Bishop Charles Graves are also interred in the grounds.  The last High King of Munster, Domnall was purportedly buried in the cathedral, with the remnants of his stone coffin still visible in the Cathedral chancel. Bishop Cornelius O'Dea is buried alongside several other Bishops of Limerick in what is believed to be an Episcopal vault underneath the chancel itself. Also notable are the Sexton, Barrington, Boyd and Vanderkiste tombs along the south entrance pathway.\n\n\n== From the Irish Reformation to the 19th century ==\n\nThere are five chandeliers which hang from the ceiling. These are only lit on special occasions. The larger three of the five were made in Dublin and presented in 1759 by the Limerick Corporation. The belfry holds a peal of eight bells, six of which were presented by William Yorke, mayor of Limerick, in 1673. An active team of bell ringers travels the country to compete with other campanologists.\nSaint Mary's received its organ in 1624, when Bishop Bernard Adams donated one. It has been rebuilt over the centuries and was most recently renovated in 1968 and 2005.\nIn 1620 the English-born judge Luke Gernon, a resident of Limerick, wrote a flattering description of the cathedral:\n\"not large, but lightsome, and by the providence of the Bishop fairly beautified within, and as gloriously served with singing and organs\".\nDuring the Irish Confederacy wars, the cathedral was briefly returned to Catholic hands. The bishop of Limerick, Richard Arthur, was buried in the cathedral in 1646.In 1651, after Oliver Cromwell's forces captured Limerick, the cathedral was used as a stable by the parliamentary army. This misuse was short lived, but was a similar fate to that suffered by some of the other great cathedrals during the Cromwellian campaign in Ireland. The troops also removed the cathedral's original 13 ft Pre-Reformation high altar from the cathedral. The altar was only reinstated in the 1960s. It is the largest such altar in Ireland and the UK, carved from a single limestone block. The altar is used for communion services at major festivals and remains in its historic location in what is now the chapel of the Virgin Mary or Lady Chapel.\nIn 1691, the cathedral suffered considerable damage, particularly on the east end, during the Williamite Siege of Limerick.  After the Treaty of Limerick, William granted \u00a31,000 towards repairs. There are cannonball from 1691 in the Glentworth Chapel/Saint George's Chapel inside.\n\n\n== From the 19th century to the 20th century ==\nIn 1968, the Irish Government commissioned two postage stamps to commemorate the cathedral's 800 year anniversary. A picture of one of the stamps is displayed on this page. In 1991, there was a large \u00a32.5 million restoration programme which was completed in 1996 with the excavation and re-laying of the floors as well as the installation of underfloor central heating.  Restoration continues today to a lesser degree.\n\n\n== From the 20th century to the 21st century ==\nToday the cathedral is still used for its original purpose as a place of worship and prayer for everybody.  It is also the 3rd biggest tourist attraction in Limerick.  It is open to the public every day from 9:00 am to 4:45 pm. For Tourists there is a \u20ac5 admission charge upon entry. This money is essential for the upkeep of the building, and without it, the cathedral simply could not function.\nFollowing the retirement of the Very Rev'd Maurice Sirr on 24 June 2012, Bishop Trevor Williams announced the appointment of the Reverend Sandra Ann Pragnell as Dean of Limerick and Rector of Limerick City Parish. She was the first female dean of the cathedral and rector of Limerick City Parish, and retired in January 2017.\nIt was announced on 27 August 2017, that the Reverend Canon Niall James Sloane was to become the 63rd Dean of Limerick and the new rector of Limerick City Parish; with his installation and institution taking place on 21 October 2017 in the cathedral.\nThe cathedral grounds holds United Nations Memorial Plaque with the names of all the Irish men who died while serving in the United Nations Peacekeepers.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDean of Limerick and Ardfert List of deans of Limerick (and Ardfert)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "The church asks for a 5 Euros donation. I have no problem paying that but when I asked if it was a donation or a ticket I got a lecture from a grumpy employee on how the church in the US is state funded (pretty sure that\u2019s not true). Told him I\u2019d pay on the way out - my",
          "i love it the staff are amazing lots of people all over come and visit the old graves new graves the music is good in the afternoon all opera",
          "Wasn't sure if three or four stars was warranted for here, but due to the sheer history of this place I went with four stars. Although it is only a suggested 5 Euro entry fee...you are pretty much not allowed to enter unless you pay it...so take the price as actually an entry",
          "The cathedral is of an interesting design. The suggested donation of five Euro's each for a part of four does seem a little excessive.",
          "Honestly I was expecting something better, there's not much to see once you got inside the place. It still has a nice story.",
          "As the oldest building in daily use in Limerick, this cathedral was bound to be interesting. It turned out to be fascinating as it has an unusual history. There are various beautiful stained glass windows,interesting alcoves and unusual woodwork (I won't spoil your experience",
          "Beautiful historical Cathedral. Built in the 1300\u2019s it is stunning piece of history. There are placards with a bit of history on the crypts and graves that really give a sense of how old this place is. Free to enter grounds but a fee of \u20ac5 /person to go into the Cathedral.",
          "Historic place very nice to visit inside and to enjoy the surroundings too. Very easy to arrive, just check the timetable.",
          "This particular church was on our list to see when we took my mother to Ireland because some distant family members (cousins of her grandparents) were baptized here. We enjoyed the mass and the members were all friendly as it was obvious we were visitors on a Sunday in",
          "Went to Sunday morning worship at 11.15 but would encourage a visit any day to explore the history as well as the quiet for prayer",
          "I have been here a few times, though only reviewing now. The grave is worth a stroll around. It contains the names of the lost irish overseas in previous wars and peace missions, and acknowledged rightly, in the united nations memorial garden. There is also an orphans grave",
          "Stunningly beautiful church. Built in the 1300\u2019s it is truly an awe inspiring piece of history. Really cool to see the leper\u2019s slit and imagine what it was like so many centuries ago.",
          "Visited the church with a friend. We looked around the graveyard first, very interesting and a few names we recognised from our visit to the castle and museum in town. Also slightly oddly a Catholic grave area in this Protestant church yard. There were beautiful trees and",
          "We visited this Church Aug 18. As we walked in we we noticed a front desk and we were unsure if you had to pay in. It is very unusual that you would have to pay into a Church in Ireland. We stood at the side deliberating whether to go in and if we had cash on us to cover the",
          "It is free to enter the grounds and doesn\u2019t take long to see. If you are in the area, there is no reason not to stop and look. There are placards with a bit of history on the crypts and graves that really give a sense of how old this place is. The area around is also very",
          "We only visited the older part of the side with the graveyard. Beautiful little church with gorgeous stained glass windows. They ask for a 5$ euro donation per person and the older woman at the front only became friendly once we paid it :) We had no problem paying it though as",
          "This is a sold performer with decent stained glass and some interesting furniture-type materials. One does get a sense of the history of the place in walking around. What I did find very off-putting was the requested 'donation', in that it was quite clear from the officious",
          "The church cemetery consists basically of two parts : the old one (and in my eyes the nicest section) on the right of the church, with the new one in front of it. The church itself has many plaques on the wall commemorating all sorts of people over several centuries. And",
          "This is a must if visiting Limerick. Very well kept, interesting and steeped in history. Leaflet you\u2019re provided with is very comprehensive as well as the detailed boards throughout. (Leaflets are available in several languages). Small donation of \u20ac5 is all that is required.",
          "Highlight of our visit to limerick was walking around this amazing cathedral. So much information included and very helpful staff on hand. If you love history and beautiful stained glass windows this is for you!",
          "Went for a quick visit with family. Very old place and has a good history behind it. A fee of 5euro as a donation for the cathedral and to see the inside.",
          "We hadn't planned to go through this place of worship, (Church of Ireland- Anglican) but we were very happy we did! It was beautiful...with unique wood carvings, stone carvings and stained glass windows.",
          "On this trip to Limerick I learned a lot about Viking expansion in Ireland which was new for me. The cathedral is built upon ancient Viking grounds and pre-dates most of the usual tourist attractions in Europe, Very interesting. I met with Noreen who works there; she was helpful",
          "This Cathedral is celebrating 850 years as goes back to 1168. The man there was very friendly and helpful and said about its history and how it was a Catholic church but turned to an Anglican church after Henry VII fell out with the Catholic church",
          "My family and I recently visited St. Mary\u2019s to tour the church and also do a bit of genealogical research. When I mentioned what we were looking for to the friendly volunteer at the reception desk, she seemed genuinely interested in helping us find the stone marker of our",
          "My mother, brother and I passed this cathedral whilst visiting Limerick and decided that we needed to enter it. We were greeted by Christina who was absolutely lovely even while battling a non-compliant cash register to sell us our tickets. This medieval building is so grand;",
          "When traveling, I love visiting Cathedrals and photographing them. This one is especially beautiful.",
          "Beautiful, historical building in the centre of Limerick city. Stunning stained glass windows and impressive architecture.",
          "We only had a short time to visit the cathedral. There are 2 I believe in the city. I do not know what the other looks like but we are glad we came here. It was just gorgeous.",
          "Church of Ireland Cathedral was quite small as cathedral goes but was full of history. Well laid out information made it easy to pick up what we needed to know. Liked the entry for 1978",
          "I spent approximately 1 hour in the cathedral. The volunteers there were extraordinarily helpful. According to the volunteers this is the oldest building in the Limerick in daily use. Give them the \u20ac5 donation for maintenance and upkeep, it is worth it. Although I loved the",
          "Beautiful inside and out, lots of information, staff well informed and able to answer all the questions we posed. Thought the entrance fee was a little high for less than an hour inside he actual cathedral.",
          "A nice example of a cathedral near the centre of Limerick. There is also a nice memorial garden for Irish soldiers that died in UN operations.",
          "This was a very interesting old building, with many displays inside and beautiful features. The 5 EUR entrance fee is a little steep for what it was, but I\u2019m glad we went in. A walk around the outside would be ok too if you wanted to save the cash.",
          "Worth paying \u20ac1 for the guide inside this Cathedral as it leads you around the Cathedral highlighting key points around the building. Very informative guide as we discovered Misericordes, (oak carved chairs) which we wouldn't have known about without it. Don't try and enter the",
          "We visited St. Mary's Twice but it was not open, so we had to settled for an exterior tour. St. Mary's is located very close to the Castle of St. John and is one of the oldest buildings in Limerick still in use today. It dates from about 1168 and is a very impressive example",
          "Quite a bit to see here - lovely stained glass windows are a special feature. Services are scheduled and there\u2019s no admittance when they\u2019re in progress. Worth a visit if you\u2019re on the way to the castle and have half an hour to spare.",
          "This cathedral is a short walk from King John's castle. Lovely stained glass and a graveyard to explore with numerous interesting gravestones.",
          "Visited Saint Mary\u2019s Cathedral yesterday with family and friends and what a fantastic experience. The adults and children loved the building the grounds and its history. Also with greats views of Limerick City. This year it celebrates its 850th anniversary. Well worth a visit if",
          "Well worth stopping by this gorgeous church and taking a self-guided tour. Lovely inside and out. Beautiful stained glass, very old church that still holds services. Visit the beautiful grounds and cemetery as well. After your tour, you should head down to Nelly's Corner for",
          "I would 100% recommend visiting the grounds and viewing the church exterior as it\u2019s beautiful. My biggest issue with my visit is that they recommended a donation of \u20ac5. Okay, fine, the church needs donations to help keep everything nice, clean, etc. This was not a",
          "I stopped by on my first afternoon in Ireland. My companion and I were exhausted from jet lag and trying to kill an afternoon before we checked in at our B and B. Once inside, we were mesmerized by the beauty of the architecture and fascinated by the history. I felt as if I",
          "Worth a visit. 850 years old this year! There is a suggested charitable contribution of 5Euro and its well worth it. Well kept and the history explained through posters on boards throughout the cathedral.",
          "The Cathedral is a very impressive building with lovely stained glass windows. It is filled with interesting pieces of history and artifacts, all have ajoining information boards. Definitely worth a visit. The two ladies at the desk were extremely kind and helpful, they took",
          "St. Mary's Cathedral is breathtaking. The stained glass windows are especially beautiful, but the whole church is impressive. We were in awe of the physical size and majesty of the church. There are beautiful Stations of the Cross depictions. You can light candles and pray for",
          "yesterday was a beautiful sunny day despite the winter chill. St Mary's Cathedral is celebrating 850 years this year with a programme of events planned for the year and an attractive Friends initiative to assist with the up keep and running of the active ancient building. my",
          "Really nice place to visit, quite spectacular are the stained glass windows. The guide is quite informative and shows many of the interesting features within. Pity none of the outside vaults are not open to visit. Overall worth a visit... It is centrally located and not too far",

          "In the heart of the Medieval area of Limerick, this Cathedral is very interesting....even informers people of the date that Munster beat the All Blacks ! Seems to be quite involved in the community and the ladies attending were very helpful. Beautiful stained glass windows and",
          "I loved this cathedral, well, I love most Church of Ireland Cathedrals! Full of history. Great afternoon out.",
          "I have never seen a church charge to get in. I was very disappointed to see that. I just wanted to go in and say a prayer, but couldn't because I refused to pay the 4 euro donation. If I went to light a candle, which I did in a church down the road, where I did make a donation",
          "Stunning and warm, you almost can feel it in your soul. I am amazed at being able to walk thru a cathedral where people stood almost 850 years ago. Truly a must see!!!",
          "This was another beautiful cathedral in Limerick. I feel like we visited so many. It sits very close to St. John's Castle, so you can walk between the two. It also sits on the River Shannon. Lovely.",
          "There is a beautiful atmosphere in this amazing Cathedral - visited on Culture Night & it was great to see the place so full",
          "The Cathedral of Saint Mary Blessed Virgin has had a long and eventful history. It was founded on King's Island in 1168, about 30 years before King John's Castle on the site of a palace donated by Donal Mor O'Brien King of Munster.",
          "Amazing cathedral to visit. Situated on the Shannon river. The view is beautiful. Take the time to visit the inside of St. Mary's to read its' history.",
          "Came along the cathedral on our way back from King John's Castle. Beautiful cathedral with a cemetary to walk through outside.",
          "Beautiful old cathedral. We stopped by on the walk to King John's Castle. The graveyard is worth exploring as well. We kind of hurried our way through, but if time permits one could spend a day here.",
          "Having grown up as a regular visitor to St Mary's Cathedral, I always enjoy going there and most recently went to photograph the bellringers for a newspaper feature.",
          "13th century still in use church. Any church older than 18th century has been transformed from catholic to church of Ireland. Situated in the older part of Limeric which became slums before Percy built the new town. Walking distance to the King John's castle.",
          "I would advice St Mary's Cathedral as a must visit when in Limerick. They have a suggested donation of \u20ac4 which is needed for the upkeep which is \u20ac500 a day. I would say this is a small donation & worthy of a little more. In recent years there is a lot more information when",
          "Beautiful old church with awesome graveyard surrounded by a great wrought iron fence! Worth a stop if in Limerick.",
          "If you are looking for the soaring heights of late medieval cathedrals with fan tracery ceilings and huge rose windows, and lady chapels lit with stained glass, this is not the place. BUT, if you are interested in an ancient structure that has seen many centuries pass by, you",
          "Regardless of your religious beliefs this old church is a place that inspires reflection. The divine, no matter how you define, resides in these places. We are glad we stopped and offered a prayer for a very ill friend.",
          "Absolutely well worth a visit, very interesting historically,lots to see.Staff helpful. Allow plenty of time as there is a lot to get around.",
          "An unassuming gem, St. Mary's Cathedral is easily overlooked in the typical tourist rush from the Hunt Museum to King John's Castle.I would have missed it had it not been for glimpses of Celtic crosses in the cemetery behind a wrought iron fence. Since a service was in progress,",
          "Simply put, the title says it all. This was well worth going to see but there is nothing completely \"spectacular\" about it. If you enjoy churches as I do, and have seen, I would say you would enjoy it, but don't look to be overwhelmed by its architecture.",
          "The entry charge is high, and there were people carrying musical instruments around, so I probably did not see this church at its best. It has a unique look and feel inside with unusual stonework, and you know you are in a very old, historic place. I'm not convincedit is worth",
          "nice and quiet, beautiful stained glass windows; good guided tour book so you can take it at your own pace.",
          "St Mary's Cathedral was originally an O'Brien stronghold but they gave it to the church. It is an 11th century building and has been a Cathedral since the 12th century. Since the Reformation it has been the Limerick Cathedral of the Church of Ireland. It is a wonderful",
          "Spent over an hour in this wonderful building and grounds just enjoying the history! Lots to read and see. Well signposted inside and good explanation of graves of interest outside. Very peaceful. Yes your asked to pay a small donation to enter but that does help to keep this",
          "This is a great medieval church. As soon as you are inside, you can see that the construction is different to churches built a couple of hundred years later. Make sure you view the Misericords, probably a bit better than the ones in St Mary's, Ripple, Worcestershire, England.",
          "I never mind giving a admission fee for a church. I know that it is used for re-hab. I enjoyed that gal that was seated taking this fee here. This is a large church with great bones. I take photo's and this had a lot of charm. I also enjoyed the old grave sites that",
          "This cathedral is 1000 years old. Though not nearly as ornate as many cathedrals in Europe, it is still stunning in architecture. A real plus is the lack of crowds. The quiet allows for private contemplation. Plus, Limerick is a lovely place to see while walking.",
          "While this is a cathedral, it isn't as grand as the word suggests. Sadly, the original plaster was falling off so they removed it and can't afford to replace, so the interior looks very rough and unfinished. Which it is. A fine place to visit if you don't have anything else to",
          "Historic St Mary\u2019s Cathedral - Church of England - inside, outside and pipe organ. Historic landmark.",
          "Worth going into on the way to the castle. Outside area needs a tidy up. Stained glass windows a delight.",
          "We saw a lot of churches, monasteries, and cathedrals in Ireland. We were quite keen to see this lovely old church but didn't because although there is a \"suggested donation\", there was a person at the entrance who required us to pay to go in. So our visit was limited to the",
          "One of the most beautiful churches we have visited. So peaceful and serene. Gorgeous architecture and stained glass windows.",
          "Walked around the church grounds. So old and sacred. Great stop on the walk to King John's Castle. There are signs everywhere that explain what each door and area mean. Actually a stop here before going to the castle makes sense as they were so connected in history!",
          "We stopped in only because it was across from the parking lot and on our way to King John's castle. It is beautiful, but very much like all the cathedrals. And there is a fee to enter.",
          "This was probably the most disappointing thing we did in lovely limerick!..the grounds are very badly kept and a lack of seating outside and WHY should i pay to visit a church?..surely they have plenty of money and this just made a very bad impression!",
          "The thick walls and light filtering in through stained glass offer a quiet respit from a day of climbing over King Johns Castle. Layers of century's of renovations add to the charm. You see and feel it's history. We also delighted in attending a service here.. a tiny, but expert",
          "We visited St Mary's only because it was pointed out to us that it is the oldest structure in the city, even older than the Norman King John's Castle. If you have visited churches in Spain or Italy, it's not too different; it's a church, but it's worth checking out for a few",
          "This is a lovely example of a medieval cathedral. The stained glass is beautiful. But it's a bit neglected. Some of the side chapels are currently used for storage of all sorts of things. It's a pitty, though.",
          "St. Mary Cathedral is old and quite big cathedral in the center near the Castle, inside is beautiful and the sound is really good.",
          "Not the most beautiful or largest cathedral, but among the oldest built in the 1100s. Good place for photography and they do a nice job of relating its history.",
          "Breathtaking stained glass and architecture. Lots of history. If I was only going to visit a few spots in Limerick, this would be one of them. Very friendly staff that welcome you.",
          "This cathedral is located in the old part of Limerick. No booking is needed. Visit to the church ground and cemetery is free but entry to the church is by donation (\u20ac4 is recommended). It's a very old church building and some parts of the interior have deteriorated, which gives",
          "I agree with previous reviewers, they tend to gloss over the history of the church. It is probably one of the prettiest unfinished cathedrals we have seen. They completely skip that Sexton was hung from his heels inside the church for three years following his untimely death.",
          "I attended one of their coral services. It was lovely and very contained everything one would expect from an Anglican Cathedral Service.",
          "The changing religious history of the building is glossed over which for many visitors will leave them in ignorance of the significant shifts in its past. I found the extensive and mainly self serving memorials which crowd every wall quite jarring. The former parishioners of the",
          "St Mary Cathedral is part of \"don t miss it \" in Limerick ... The church itself absolutely worth it ... Oldest building in Limerick founded in the 12th century on a hill on King's Island which is the oldest part of Limerick. On top of the architecture & church itself ... A",
          "It was a very short walk from our hotel and well worth the trip. Unfortunately, we went after hours so we were not able to go inside, but we loved reading the old grave stones and waking the perimeter. The west door is amazing!!",
          "This is one of the oldest intact buildings in Limerick. I love this place. If you're lucky you'll get a tour of the church. If you're luckier you will catch a lunchtime recital on Wednesdays from 1-2 or one of the many activities that go on here. All for a donation. And so",
          "This is a beautiful building. They ask for a \u20ac4 donation but if not it's no problem. We paid it as im sure it is an expensive building to keep. There is a great story to this and you get a booklet on entering. It's very peaceful even when busy. Not far from St John's Castle if",
          "Visited the cathedral for the opening service of the Synod 2017. What a spectacularly beautiful building and so very well kept. Would like to visit again and have a proper look around - well worth a visit.",
          "This is a place for meditation on life and where we are , it is a relaxing place with great stained glass windows and a great high ceiling",
          "We loved it such history a beautiful and spiritual Cathedral; I love cemetery's in general and they had one of the best. The structure is just beautiful.",
          "Turning our attention to St. Mary\u2019s, which we later learned was the regional seat of the Church of Ireland, we found the blend of Romanesque and Gothic handsome. The grey stone vaulted ceiling set off the stained glass windows, which dated from the 19th and 20th Centuries. The",
          "It was a nice stop. Didn't take too long but a very pretty cathedral to see. They had a nice paper guide to walk around with and give you history on the cathedral. While I was there, a pianist and singer were practicing and were great. It is close to King John's Castle. In",

          "4 euro to get in. The cemetery on the outside not well maintained an some stones hard to read, but what do you expect when their dated from 1736 on. Inside, I was unimpressed for as many old cathedrals I have visited. Unfinished except for the stained glass windows. It's a 900+",
          "Obviously a ton of history and again maybe something I wouldn't take little kids to BUT it is gorgeous and is at least worth a quick walk through.",
          "Amazing architecture which is great for a history lover like me. Well worth my time to visit here and would suggest it to anyone.",
          "Good educational trip worth a visit a must see for any one visiting Limerick or a lover of local history",
          "Stunning architecture and located close to King John's Castle be transported back to medieval times.",
          "St. Mary's Cathedral is open for the public, they ask a small donation for maintenance of the church. It's worth visiting the cathedral, although it's not as spectacular as some of the bigger cathedrals in other places.",
          "The stained glass windows are so awe inspiring. The 5 chandeliers are still used on special occasions. We had the opportunity to hear the organ and choir. A lot of history surrounds this cathedral. It is just around the corner from St. John's castle. There is a little cafe kiddy",
          "This building is almost 850 years old and is laden with history and still functioning as a Church of Ireland house of prayer. Often there are concerts there too so its well worth a visit. Outside there are magnificent views of the river Shannon from the West Door and King John's",
          "This is one of the most worthwhile visits and important sites in Limerick. The cathedral is a credit to those who care for it. It is an oasis of peace, prayer and reflection, and it speaks parts of Ireland's narrative. The handout guide is available in several languages.",
          "I could see the cathedral from my hotel room across the Shannon River. It becomes me to visit on Christmas morning. I learned that was built in the 11th century. It's near King John's Castle and easy to walk to and find. I walked around three sides and enjoyed the gravestones to",
          "I have been in the cathedral in the daytime as a visitor, it is a fascinating place, the history of it is part of the fabric of the city and you could easily spend a few hours there reading and feeling its story. it is still active as a working church and there are services",
          "St. Mary's has been alive for well over a thousand years. You get a sense of the changes in the Catholic practices over the centuries by visiting here. Patrons left their plaques everywhere. Sad to see the Lepers' Squint where in medieval times, the lepers attended Mass by",
          "Didn't go inside, but the outside and the cemetery were very interesting. Would like to have had more time",
          "Wonderful structure - and great history. There inside has much info about the history and bin great detail. Brochures in many languages. Beautiful windows and art works. Well worth a visit.",

          "My husband and I visited this beautiful, very old church from the 1100's. It is the oldest and most historic building in Limerick, although apparently much of it has been added to and altered over the years. The church is open to the public apparently seven days a week. We",
          "Amazing history in the place. The structure is fantastic and it largely escaped gothic alterations. The removal of the plaster allows a totally different feel particularly of the columns.",
          "Really well preserved piece of history. Begun in the 12th century, the church is a great example of construction thru the years and has well preserved example of religious fixtures from all ages.",

          "Turned up half-way during a service, so we missed the sermon, but we wree made very welcome and it was lovely to experience the church as a place of worship. Well worth a visit - very interesting from a historical point of view and beautiful inside",
          "Requires a donation. Take note that this is not a Catholic Church. The outside is prettier than the inside, but still worth a short visit.",
          "In the past year, we have been to a Vivaldi evening as well as the Irish Youth Guitar Orchestra - beautiful setting and fantastic acoustics",
          "Really old Cathedral founded back in 1168... It has survived years of wars and destruction, invasion of Oliver Cromwell, and little is left there from the old days... Very atmospheric place... the imposing building itself, the old cemetery with typical Celtic crosses...the",
          "Beautiful cathedral if you're in to that sort of thing. Very close to the city centre and other attractions so might as well fit it in when visiting.",
          "We were walking around the town and stopped in to see this church. There are alot of Graves around the outside that are very old. It's one of top things to see in Limerick.",
          "St. Mary's Cathedral is a beautiful church loaded with history. From the rough walls to the beautiful stained glass windows you can feel how people, the ages and the events (sieges, religious turmoil) have transformed it over time without it ever losing its character. The",
          "This was our favorite attraction in Limerick. St.Mary's Cathedral has been a place of worship for over 840 years and is the oldest building still in use in the city of Limerick. The guide to the church is well organized and interesting to read. It describes the Reredos carved by",
          "This was a quick, cool visit. Great photo ops, and I recommend walking around the graves a bit. If you like horror in movies and books, this place is inspiring.",
          "What an interesting piece of religious history and culture. 4 euro donation that is required...still figuring that one out. Detailed stained glass windows",
          "First thing I say is get a guided tour, This place is full of stories and history , its a beautiful building and well preserved there are many things to see and its an education in itself. first visit here then the castle then hunt museum and lock gur and bunratty but be sure to",
          "This is a very old cathedral founded nearly a thousand years ago. So, it has that very old feel, smell (and not in a bad way). They lay out the history quite nicely but we got through this one pretty quickly in around 30 minutes.",
          "On the one hand, the loosely collected furniture and disassembled displays here and there seemed like the interior presentation was a work in progress; while on the other, the accessibility of the raw and complex antiquity of the place enhanced the visit with authenticity and",
          "This place seems like one giant memorial (which says a lot considering its a church), with items all over the grounds and inside dedicated to the dearly departed. Its by far the oldest and largest church Ive been in, with most of the building being rough stone, which",
          "We walked around Limerick looking for local attractions and lunch. We noticed the cathedral and decided to check it out. I found a local orchestra practicing inside the cathedral. It was amazing to listen to. The grounds were beautiful and worth a visit.",
          "An interesting historic site to visit. The Cathedral is situated beside Limerick City Hall and very close to King John's Castle. It's still functioning as a place of worship as well as hosting classical music recitals regularly. The graveyard is quite interesting as it has many",
          "The cathedral alone was haunting, enchanting and beautiful but to visit it at Christmas time with a beautiful choir performing was magical. Mulled wine and mince pies added to the festive magic. The cathedral is beautifully preserved and a fine example of it's kind nestled in",
          "My family (wife, kids aged between 9 and 16) and I visited St. Mary's on a trip to Limerick. We toured the grounds, including cemetery, and did the self-guided tour inside the cathedral. There was no set fee, but a suggested donation, which we paid. Our family is really into",
          "Built in 1100, incredible, architecture, stained glass windows, statues and furniture. Even the Cemetery is something to see. A small donation is requested to tour the inside, So impressed and wanted to help the church survive a larger donation was provided. This has so far been",
          "When you walk the church you really feel the place is old and full of history. After visiting the church, we walked around the cemetery which is located on the right side of the building.",
          "This gorgeous cathedral is absolutely breath-taking with its beautiful and intricate stained glass windows, and its immense pipe organ. You must enter to experience the grandeur and appreciate its enormity. Worth the 4 euros!",
          "A real sense of times past in this Cathederal. The self guided tour is well signposted and explained. A real feeling of history, untouched and original. The misericordiae chairs are unreal - a different world - like a time machine experience to see them. However - if the",

          "The docents at the church are very welcoming and full of information about this church. Pamphlet for walking tour is very informative. Church is very quiet and peaceful.",
          "This church is a surprise as it has been left to show the original roughened stonework. You can imagine it as it was first built with the vaulted timber ceilings. A impressive building within the walls of the city along side King Johns Castle.",
          "Beautiful church well worth visiting. Recommend you read the dozen or so history boards. Puts everything into prospective. Internals of the church are lovely, beautiful stained glass windows. A lot of history here. Suggest you visit the grave yard.",
          "This was an amazing cathedral to visit. We must have spent an hour here looking at all of the stained glass and historical markers. Certainly gives you a feeling of awe when you walk in. The only downside is their \"giftshoppe\" ccould use a lot of help, everything they had for",

          "A beautiful big old stone cathedral. I didn't see any trash on the grounds as some other reviewers have mentioned. Inside it looked as one might expect. So if you're bothered by the \u20ac4 \"donation\", you can skip that part. Really wanted to give it 3 1/2 stars, but since I",
          "I had been to Limerick before but without visiting this fine old church, to my shame. It is the oldest building (still in use) in Limerick but badly in need of conservation. Entrance fee only 4 euros but money well spent on a good cause. The staff are very well informed and take",
          "We did not go in the Cathedral, we were in a hurry to get back to the hotel....but walking around the grounds was beautiful. It is perfect for pictures. The trees were blooming so it was the perfect time of year.",

          "Having been in numerous cathedrals, I can say that St. Mary's, founded in the 12th century, is now one of my two favorites! The interior is not to be believed, architecturally speaking plus the furnishings including wood carvings (that took 20 years to carve) on the lip of 23",
          "Loved all the churches in Ireland...and this is a another one you should most definitely stop and see.",
          "We are not enthusiastic church visitors but in this case we were attracted by the graveyard surrounding this cathedral. A small 4 euro fee was collected at the front door for this self-guiding tour. There is much need for maintenance and upkeep both inside and out. If you are",
          "It was with a touch of shame I told my wife I had never ventured into this cathedral previously having gone past it many hundreds of times so this has now been remedied. And I am glad I did. It is not a typically large church but it has a nice collection of interesting items.",
          "This cavernous space has real character and a fascinating history. The carved seats of oak, the bishop's hall, the story of the O'Brien whose body was thrown in the Shannon by the people of Limerick. Well worth an hour's visit.",
          "This is a beautiful, Gothic cathederal with some original stone work. The church and grounds are interesting.",
          "One can't help but be humbled that such a beautiful structure of faith has been here for so long. Definitely worth a little time out of your day. Even if you do not go inside, just a stroll outside is nice. The cemetery has gravesites dating back centuries. Imagine the stories",
          "Great old church, renovated inside. Interesting. Good example of the era. Brick construction. Charge for entry.",
          "I believe the entry fee was 4 euro but it was a donation to the church, so it felt worthwhile. Upon entry, you receive a brochure with self-guide tour which had good information about each part of the church. The church is beautiful with gorgeous stained glass. Doesn't take",
          "Totally in awe of the rich history in this stunning cathedral. Founded before the Magna Carta and the death of Genghis Khan on a Viking meeting house,witness to royalty and changing rulers through the ages.",
          "This is a beautiful old church and is definitely worth seeing. It is a short walk (approx 2 mins) from the city centre. Looking around the grounds is free, but 4 euro per person to look around inside. Definitely worth the money!",
          "Unfortunately the Cathedral was closed on our tour day but we still had a great time walking aground. There are some wall remains left from that early 11th century that was the most important for me to see. Would recommend to get Cathedral opening time before visiting.",
          "St. Mary's Cathedral is the oldest building in Limerick (1168 ). It is used daily as a tourist attraction admitting nearly 100 to 150 tourists. I worked there for a while a few years back with my job and the cathedral was under renovation at the time but now it is completed and",

          "A beautiful church and grounds in an historic city. I could have spent hours in St. Mary's, sublime. Beautifully kept with a fascinating history. I am looking forward to visiting again.",
          "This cathedral has so much history, and so many interesting things to see. Be sure to look for the leper's hole. There is a brochure available, but I think there is much more to learn. I would suggest asking if there is someone available to help you out. We spoke with David",
          "Beautiful Cathedral both externally and internally with lots of history. We went into the Cathedral after being recommended by our walking tour guide. A charge of 4 euros is requested to contribute to the upkeep of the Cathedral which we where happy to pay.",

          "I was so happy to visit St. Mary's Cathedral , especially when it is the oldest building in Limerick. The quiet of the cathedral allowed for a peaceful visit.",
          "It is absolutely amazing to think that something built in 1168 can still be standing and in quite good shape. The architecture hasn't changed much since then for more modern churches in the centuries after. The church is still being worked on to survive for many more years but",
          "You have to pay a small entry fee but it is worth it. It will not take long but if you like visiting churches this is worth a short visit",
          "We would not have visited this church but our guide outlined its history to us and then we had to visit! It was a walk though history and very interesting.",
          "First of all there is a \u20ac4 charge to look around in a place of worship which I personally don't believe is very appropriate as churches and cathedrals are free to see across Europe apart from some exceptions but this one isn't one of those exceptional ones that I would pay to go",
          "There is a 4 Euro charge to enter but the church is beautiful and of course the history is intriguing. I enjoyed wandering the cemetery as well, there are always amazing stories to be found. The grounds are lovely as well. And right across the street is the Locke Bar, perfect",
          "This church is very interesting place to visit. The inside and outside has a lot of history to it. Stroll around the grave markers outside the church after you finish seeing the beautiful inside. It is well worth a visit while in Limerick.",
          "This is one beautiful piece of architecture overseeing the city of limerick for over a 1000 years. Inside the majestic walls give you the permanence of faith and safety. There are very lovely window with stain glass. And to top everything there was a soprano with an angelic",
          "A little cathedral that has lots of history. It is said to be the oldest on in the country. Very interesting history timeline posted on the boards located towards the back of the church. 4 euro to enter.",
          "Beautiful cathedral that allow you access to all parts of the building. There is a small charge for entrance but it's worth it.",
          "I enjoyed walking on the grounds and viewing the graveyard surrounding the church, the gardens, and plaques showing that this is the burial ground of historical figures. I also toured the inside of the church, for which they require a \"donation.\" The money is supposed to go",
          "I live close by for the past year and had never been in to this church. I was with a friend and when we saw people around we decided to go in. this beautiful church we were greeted by a man called Victor who put us in the last tour up to the bell tour. they showed us the art of",
          "From the cemetery outside to the stained glass inside, definitely worth a visit. It's just down the road from King John's Castle so put this on your agenda if you have the time. Takes as long as you have or want. Glad we went.",
          "Loved walking the old cemetery on the church grounds. Inside is awesome with all the beautiful stained glass windows.",
          "Beautiful church and grounds . Entrance fee of \u00a34 euro but work it to help maintain the historical features of the church .",
          "Better at the end of a sunny day because the lights over the Cathedral are special. Nice place to visit if you are around Limerick.",
          "Well worth a visit, full of historical information and also a peaceful sancturary from the day. Stained glass windows well worth a look.",
          "A nice location and great views of the city. Lovely Cathedral and very historic interior. A nice stop anytime but also good for a rainy day.",
          "bitterly disappointed this time around there was a fee number one the place was dark inside and one had to squint to see the plaques on the walls used to love this place and was always so proud to take tourists there needs better lighting . they have messed it up indeed so wont",
          "No longer a church apparently - rather a museum and music venue for which they charge admission. Particularly obnoxious old women guarding the doors against anyone who might want to pray there. Definitely one to avoid at all costs.",
          "It's a church. Pretty old, interesting graveyard, nice grounds. The architecture did not wow. But if you're in Limerick, you'll be visiting this Church of Ireland church.",
          "Worth the visit. It's magnificent. Short walk from the Strand Hotel, just over the bridge. The stain glass windows are so beautiful",
          "This cathedral is absolutely amazing. The history in this place is phenomenal. I would have to say this is probably one of the most beautiful sites in all of Limerick. The day we were visiting, the organist was actually doing some playing also, so that was grand! If you're",
          "The sense of history & the sacred are very real as you walk around this very old Cathedral. It would be a shame to visit Limerick & not get to visit this important part of its religious history.",
          "Wonderful wonderful church. So full of history and atmosphere. Great brochure - in full colour and easy to follow - made our visit complete although a tour guide would have been better.",
          "St Mary's cathedral is an amazing atmospheric cathedral in Limerick city and they have free 1 hour 30 minute (roughly) classical music concerts every Wednesday free of charge ( donation optional). A great break for tired legs after sightseeing or from the rain!",
          "Most beautiful church and historic visit. I strongly recommend after you visited the castle that you walk To the church.",
          "To be honest, cathedrals have never done much for me, so take this review with that in mind. This cathedral is one of the three main attractions in downtown Limerick so you almost have to go; but while one has to admire the effort and workmanship needed to create such a church,",
          "Beautiful property and well worth a visit. Also take a walk around the grounds and the graveyard. Plan to spend a bit of time to properly take it all in.",
          "We popped in looking for things to do in Limerick, and this was grand. There are things that Cromwell's troops damaged a few centuries ago. The misericords (go and learn what they are) have grotesques that each merit a look.",
          "We wandered into the building out of the rain a couple of weeks ago and were immediately stunned by the beauty and quiet inside. We could peer over, from where we entered, to the larger open cathedral area but didn't end up going in as they didn't take credit cards. We were at a",
          "If you like history, this is a good stop. The church seemed kind of messy to me and the staff wasn't very friendly. We spent about 20 minutes looking around, but at 4 Euros a person I thought it was a little steep for what you see.",
          "I called here by myself after the hunt museum (the staff recommended it) and it was beautiful and very peaceful . The stained glass windows was amazing to look and photograph with the sun streaming in. The architecture was also beautiful. Yes \u20ac4 may be expensive but seeing as",
          "Beatiful historic structure and gounds, cemetary and old market wall. A great piece of history and an obvious top attraction in Limerick.",
          "You will love this cathedral and the surrounding area. It's old (847 years to be exact!!!) and absolutely gorgeous inside!!! The various chapels inside are as beautiful as anything I have ever seen in larger cathedral! Absolutely a MUST-see!!!",
          "It's amazing to think this church is still standing. A lot of history within and as you wander around you get a sense of how old this church is. Outside, the graves and tombs are just as amazing - but definitely a place for the fit and healthy to get around. A 'voluntary'",
          "Founded in 1168AD, cool old church, now Anglican. Cooler still, grave yard with Celtic crosses for many grave markers.",
          "Very interesting and bells chime Ave Maria at midday the interior of the church is very beautiful and felt like a church as many feel more like a museum.",
          "Very old church still in use. We went to a choral service. The acoustics were fantastic. The choir was not large but full of beautiful voices.",
          "Atmospheric mediaeval cathedral. .well worth a visit. Interesting memorials. Car park just beside the cathedral. Minutes from the city centre",
          "I do not remember having to pay entry fee for any cathedrals that we visited in our travels, except for this one. We did not pay the 4.00 euro per person entry fee. Despite the rich history of the church, charging anyone to view a church is a bit ridiculous.",
          "Loved all of it especially visiting the gravesites, feeling the history surrounding the area. Donation only, no admission fee",
          "The church has an interesting history but the interior is unremarkable. I don't like enforced entrance fees to churches. I always pay at least the suggested amount but it's quite unusual to have someone on the door taking entrance money. It doesn't sit well with me. The",
          "The 'donation' is enforced as an entrance fee with no discount for seniors. The graveyard (which is free to visit) is very well marked out. The interior was ok but for me not a must see. Ok to while away an hour or so.",
          "St Mary's Church is one of the original structures to ever exist in Limerick. The church is beautiful, inside and out. The grounds and cemetery are lovely. Even if you are not religious, the history there is palpable. I would recommend a visit to St Mary's Church.",
          "Visited on my mobility scooter. Could not use smooth access path as it was blocked by a car. Went up a rough road but had to give up when confronted with cobbles. I took the hint and could not go inside. Obviously no idea now to be an inclusive venue unlike many other ancient",
          "We visited it on Sunset. It was very beautiful as well as graveyard. Plan too visit it last in the evening as after that you can go to nice pub \"The Locke\" to have great food and beer after a good walk.",
          "This church left me speechless. I enjoy visiting churches all over the world when I travel. This church had a lot of beauty, and very spiritual feeling about it. There is a cemetery on the grounds from a million years ago. It was just beautiful and peaceful. Well worth the",
          "The Cathedral is rather a sad reminder of the ravages of time. Due to extensive problems with damp, all internal plaster has had to be removed and the Cathedral is in a pretty sorry state. There is however a lovely High Altar.",
          "Great historical site. A lot to read and see inside and outside the church. Close to king johns castle. Donations are required to enter.",
          "The delight of the unexpected such as the burial place of the Prince of Montenegro. Very well labelled features are a huge help. Allow a good twenty minutes to do it justice.",
          "This Anglo- Norman Cathedral is quite a landmark on the city skyline and is easy enough to visit as it is en route to the castle. It too, like many cathedrals in Ireland, has been altered, added to, refurbished and the end result is sometimes a jumble of different architectural",
          "WE were passing by on our way from the castle and decided to look in. It is and impressive building and the desk attendant is most helpful, especially if you need a toilet.",
          "Beautiful building giving a fascinating insight into the history of Limerick city. The bells were ringing while we were there giving a really special experience. My standout favourite attraction in the city.",
          "The cathedral is wheelchair accessible at the front door or for people with buggies. There are toilets for the public at the back if you ask the desk attendant.",
          "From King John's Castle you can view all the churches in the Limerick area and you can walk to several of them from there. No facilities available and not wheelchair accessable but King john's Castle is close by and it is.",
          "This was a great church to visit. Full of history. Easy walk from the Castle. It does not require a lot of time.",
          "This cathedral was neat to see, but it is not as fancy as some of the other cathedrals we have visited before. It has a lot of history and is true to the time it was built. However, it felt kinda cold and plain compared to others. Still glad we visited to see this type of",
          "A wonderful place to visit. The beauty of the Architecture is amazing. A must see............................................",
          "The Cathedral firstly is a place of worship so visitors need to respect that. The cathedral receives no money from the state so it must fund itself. It has to be the most interesting building in Limerick! Remember the desk attendant will give tours if needed. Fantastic visit!",
          "Quite an unexpected treat! This is a beautiful and evocative place that is really well worth a visit. It was built in the 12th century and is just drenched in Limerick and Irish history.It is well worth taking your time and spending an hour or two here and is within easy walking",
          "We went for a walk after visiting King John's castle and stumbled on St. Mary's by accident. What a beautiful surprise! It is a classic Gothic structure and it has an interesting graveyard. A worthwhile visit for the religious as well as the historian traveler.",
          "My husband and I were at St. Mary's on St. Patrick's Day, almost ready to go, and asked a question of the person that just appeared from the back room. It was Dean Sandra, and she ended up giving us a private tour of the church, complete with history lesson. The information",
          "If you are on the Island in Limerick and at King Johns Castle then you have to walk down to the Cathedral. Amazing building and graveyard. Overlooking the shannon. Beautiful.",
          "Too expensive ! 4 euros per person for... a little cathedral. Why ? It's a shame for a lot of tourists...",
          "It was a beautiful location with parts rich in history but for four euros per person at first a 'suggested donation' and then when those in front asked it changed to 'admission fee.' The amount of space that you are able to see and the 1970 and later memorials make this an",
          "I loved attending church and exploring the grounds and garden. Great history. The church is well maintained, and has great information about the church and the area.",
          "Here since 1168 this is the historical heart of the city. A walk among the tombstones is a must and of course the building itself is magnificent. If you are lucky enough to catch a choral or musical performance here it is simply majestic.",
          "love this old cathedral it is so beautiful inside have visited many times it is steeped in history and was fascinated by the plaques on the walls commemorating the people who died in the Crimea and the boar war the grounds hold the burial place of some people mainly protestant",
          "St. Mary's is a fantastically old historical gem in the city and has a number of quirks that make it well worth a visit. From the leper's squint, to the miscordiae, there is plenty to see despite its compact size. There is an overview of the history of the site, with odd events",
          "This is a very beautiful church, especially around Christmas. It can be a bit cold as per usual but it's very peaceful.",
          "My wife loves to visit this every time we're in Limerick. It's a beautiful and very old church. The memorials on the walls inside the church are fascinating.",
          "Walking into St.Mary's you quickly become very aware you are walking into a very special place , the history here is amazing , it's an absolutely beautiful place just to sit and gather your thoughts , if you are lucky enough to visit when there is a choir singing or practicing",
          "Wow, the beautiful stained glass windows are spectacular and do many of them. Thought the lepers snitch explanation was interesting. Nothing we didn't like.",
          "We hadn't planned on being in Limerick on our tour of Ireland but we were all glad we did. On Sunday we made plans to go see the Castle nearby. We parked a block from the church and its beauty and age caught our attention. So we walked around to the gate and went in to take",
          "For me it was fascinating. I like things that are old, and that is the first thing that comes to mind when you enter this cathedral. Protestant now, but with a lot of pre-reformation catholic relics.",
          "Beautifully maintained grounds surround the old church. Inside is magnificent! We loved the somber beauty of it all. The tranquil atmosphere lends itself to peaceful meditation.",
          "The outside of the church is beautiful, nice walk through the attached graveyard. The person inside the church was quite unfriendly and demanded a donation of 3 euros to see the inside. I would not have had a problem paying that, but the person demanding the money did not",
          "900 year old church which has been somewhat restored. Self guided tour - 3 Euro donation at the door. Impressive overall structure however it was difficult to tell where the original structure was and where and when the successive updates were made.",
          "This is a small cathedral compared to the great English ones, but it is significant in its age and it has been very well looked after. There is a good collection of stained glass. My grandparents and two aunts are buried in the graveyard which is mainly what I wanted to see.",
          "If you like to visit churches I recommend going to see this one. Ireland seems unique in that there is a simple elegance to their churches. This church is ancient and lovely with magnificent stained glass windows, stone floors, creaking pews and gobs of history. The outside is",
          "This is a beautiful building the door is stunning I have photographed many weddings there and it is a fantastic backdrop and atmosphere The chairs are soft not at all hard to sit through a long service surprise",
          "Strange thing, as the first thing we encountered on entering the cathedral was an exhibition of sailboats due to a special youth project. Personally I enjoyed what was outside more. A couple of vaults displaying interesting historic names, but not accessible, unfortunately.",
          "We didn't get a chance to see the inside of the church but the grounds are full of gravestones. Just walking around them I had a feeling of \"being at peace\".",
          "Stepping inside the oldest standing building still used for its original purpose was breath taking. The west door is part of the original structure. The stained glass is absolutely beautiful. See this historic building while it is still open.",
          "St. Mary's is so old, it amazed me to see how well preserved it is. The grounds convey a sense of the ages, and once inside I was struck at how well this cathedral represents the era of its construction. The small write-up, which is available, provides good information, but I",
          "I was disappointed as it was not open! Altho we walked all around the outside and were greatly impressed by the architecture.",
          "The staff was terrifically rude....but the cathedral is totally worth it anyways. The windows and the stonework are beautiful. Don't miss the lepers peep hole. Sad and fascinating",
          "I went to the Cathedral knowing it would be beautiful and I was not disapointed! There was actually a wedding ceremony taking place and i was able to see the altar from the back of the church without bothering the wedding. It is truly worth the visit and serenity found only in a",

          "July 31st 2014 I visited this Cathedra,l it was very interesting looking at all the Chapels. Also they had a visit from Lions Youth Brass Band from the U.K and they were magnificent it was wonderful.",
          "Its history was well told in the booklet I was given at the door and only a 3 euro donation. Magnificant stained glass work.",
          "The cathedral is constructed in a fashion that greatly enhances the quality of sound, I am told, I have taken in a number of concerts in here this year, all as part of the City of Culture, and I can attest to that. The concerts tend to be on Wednesdays at lunchtime, but do",
          "Brillant One of the most Finest Cathedrals in Ireland well worth a visit if in Limerick touring at a very reasonable price for entry. I liked everything about my trip to St Mary's Cathedral",
          "I loved the exhibition about how lots of local churches are now being used. The miserichords are fascinating too",
          "I wasn't expecting that much but found visiting the cathedral a great experience. The churchyard is full of interesting monuments and gravestones, the cathedral is a wonderfuls pace with more historic monuments and there is a lot of information to explain features. The main",
          "A modest cathedral with beautiful stained glass window and interior. Friendly, welcoming guides and an intersting history. Close to St. John's Castle Museum which is well worth a visit and should be on Trip Advisor. Piano recital was occuring.",
          "Another walk for me ended up here and glad I did, beautiful architecture, also met a lovely family who stopped to chat and tell me about some more places to visit. Thanks Ann and Charlie",
          "the grounds and the church were beautiful. the detail inside the church was very detailed and intricate. the cemetery on the grounds was interesting. there was a recommended donation of 3 euro per person but we gave 5 i believe. the donation went to keeping the grounds as they",
          "Extremely poor experience. The church is a mess. Nothing to be seen. Trash allover the place, seems that nobody cares about this place for decades. Don't wast your time on this.",
          "the graveyard is very interesting. there is a part of the graveyard, gate locked to left of front church door, that is very airy and a bit spooky. standing at the gate u get a foul smell and a very cold breeze. the experience is one that will stay with u.",
          "This cathedral is a must if you are visiting Limerick. Old and beautiful with wonderful stories. You are able to photograph, and have a tour guide if desired.",
          "This church has been in constant use for centuries. The many remodels show in the structure. The is much to see and it is provided in the literature. Also there were demo boards showing historical periods. A must see in the area.",
          "A beautiful historical building and graveyard. Unfortunately your donation gets you a booklet only. I think this wonderful piece of architecture deserves more and guided tours with stories and events that are coming up would be beneficial, like St. Pauls and Westminster Abbey.",
          "Lots of history in the place but it is in need of serious renovation (i.e. saving). Stained glass windows are the highlight of this rather average site.",
          "this cathedral is just fantastic the history is something you can feel as soon as you enter not to be missed on a visit to limerick city link this visit to go to king johns castle just a short walk away magic",
          "Couldn't see much of the \"normal\" cathedral, since there was construction going on inside for a show of some sort. Looked like they were building an ark for a show or play that was coming up. Would have been beautiful w/o the contractors and such.",
          "It would be a shame to miss this and at only \u20ac3 each to get in you cant go wrong! It was built around 1168 and is still in daily use. Check out the misericords (or mercy seats) - they are the only complete set left in Ireland and are well worth seeing.",
          "This old church is worth the stop. Very interesting to visit and it has a lot of history.... Very beautiful windows.",
          "Such a beautiful cathedral, and cemetery. A cute little orange kitty greeted us when we arrived too! The large wooden front door is stunning, make sure to get a picture.",
          "This venerable old building is full of history and though rather crumbly inside, it has much to offer. In any other country the state would be falling over itself to preserve and display such buildings but here we seem to be happy to let them gently crumble. The 3 euro suggested",
          "Had to go back to see inside of the church as its not always open.Even walking around the outside you see some spectacular architecture.Got a great tour of the inside from a docent that just happened to be around,so got a little more of the history behind it",
          "St. Mary's Cathedral is steeped in history. It is well worth a visit. A walk around the graves outside is a must.",
          "This cathedral has so much history, yet those who were there were not friendly or seem to have any desire to share the history. They were doing some work on the cathedral and it seems dirty and unkempt. For 3 Euros a person it was a bit steep for the experience.",
          "I love old and beautiful places like St Mary's. It seems God is right there with you! We went old the self guided tour and came into the church just as the sun was hitting the stained glass. One word:wow!",
          "We slipped in Sunday morning and caught the last half of the service. It's hard to describe the feeling of experiencing such a moving spiritual event in a cathedral that's nearly 1000 years old, even for non-religious people. It's tricky to arrange a visit in the off-season, but",
          "History here is all around you. In the ground, on the walls, above your head and under your feet. Location is central to town and also around other very interesting places like king johns castle and the hunt museum.",
          "Went to this lovely place at night. Very nice building and cemetery. Well worth a visit to anyone interested in history.",
          "To find out about the history of Limerick, this is a great starting poing. This is a gem, and can be visited more than once.",
          "we had a pleasant visit, first impressions small, but as you go round it is so informative. we found information on hand to explain parts of the Cathedral, the surrounding graveyard was well maintained. They were doing restoration work when we visited so areas were mixed up and",
          "St. Mary's Cathedral in Limerick is certainly worth a quick visit. Be sure to read about its history in the brochures at the front desk.",
          "This Cathedral is definitely a place to see. Fascinating, beautiful and rich of history. The feeling of peace it inspires is something great. Have a sit, and then walk in the graveyard which is also fascinating.",
          "This is worth a visit if you are in Limerick. Every Irish City has at least one large cathedral and this is one of them. Lots of history and worth your time.",
          "One of the most interesting and important sights in Limerick city - also one of the oldest Cathedrals in Ireland. To put it in perspective, this building was 200 years old when Dante wrote the Inferno. I would recommend viewing it from across the river at Clancy's Strand first",
          "We brought friends to visit this wonderful medieval Cathedral. It is an outstanding experience to see the real history of Limerick literally written in stone.",
          "It was ancient but very well preserved and packs in 900 years of history as well as been an Architectural Gem.",
          "A church of tremendous historical significance and character.Definitely, a step back in time which alone makes it worth visiting.Sometimes there are lunchtime concerts which make a wonderful lunch time break from the stresses of the world. The graveyard, located in the grounds,",
          "I visited St.Mary's for the first time this year, despite having lived in Limerick for most of my life. It is the oldest building still used for it's original purpose in Limerick, the original building being built in 12th century. The inside in currently undergoing renovations",
          "This is a beautiful old cathedral that is still in use. It has been maintained very well, and is a nice one to visit. I would love to hear some music in this building as I think it would be fantastic! The cemetery is an interesting walk through history, as well.",
          "Such history in this location. The cathedral was beautiful and the gardens around the cathedral were beautiful",
          "Well worth a visit to this Cathedral which was built in 1168! There is an admission charge of 5 euros which sounds a lot but as it goes toward the upkeep of this lovely old building, please don't let it put you off.",
          "This historic church needs a lot of repair to bring it back to life. It is currently undergoing a much needed renovation. There is a requested 3 euro charge to visit which goes toward funding the restoration effort. It is worth seeing only because of it's history and not",
          "This is a very old and beautiful attraction on the banks of the river Shannon, and has an ethereal beauty about it. Try and get to a musical recital there, particularly choral music, as the acoustics are wonderful.",
          "Real Irish history and beautiful surroundings!! i would suggest this to anyone. Really worth the trip!!",
          "What a treasure. We were able to attend a bit of the service. This cathedral dates back to the 1100's, and it is still serving the community today. The beauty is mind blowing when one realizes the skill and expertise necessary to produce this structure --- and all without",
          "Absolutely loved this chuch! Cost is a mere 3 euros. Each room has it's own informative guideline so you know exactly what you're looking at. The stained glass windows are amazing! Lepers squint is hidden a bit behind the organ, but definately interesting! I would",
          "I visited this beautiful cathedral on a rainy day. I was admiring the ground of the church as service was going on inside the church. A lady from the church invited me to attend the service while I was passing by the entrance. It was very warm and welcoming. Inside building",
          "This was an amazing find for us as we drove through Limerick. The beauty of this place and the people that were inside was a joy I will never forget. Although it was raining the day we visited, it did not keep us from enjoying the grounds and the history that surrounded this",
          "The old adjacent cemetery told quite a story of Limerick. It was a nice spot along the river. There was Christmas mass when we visited so we did not view the interior so as not to interrupt, and parts of the exterior appeared to be under construction, but the visible parts",
          "I was surprised I was the only one visiting this beautiful cathedral on a nice friday afternoon. The parking lot was filled yet it was just I and the sweet woman selling trinkets. a very peaceful place to go.",
          "I happened to stumble upon St. Mary's Cathedral and I am so happy I did. Beautiful piece of history. A must see for anyone visiting Limerick.",

          "I travelled all the way to Limerick to see the cathedral and it was closed to visitors. There was an outstanding review of St. Marys but it appeared to me that it is not very welcoming",
          "It is still In the restoration stages, but worth a visit. Stained glass windows are beautiful. It is a very large with different artifacts and carvings around every corner.",
          "We didn't attend a service here, but rather stopped in for a quiet visit. This is a beautiful cathedral! There is a quaint cemetery outside the cathedral. There were some slight renovations going on when we visited, so a couple areas were blocked off to the public. There are",
          "This cathedral illustrates the histoy of Limerick city. It is very well preserved. Also, if a tourist is unlucky with the weather, St. Mary''s is a great indoor venu!!!!",
          "Based in centre of Limerick on O'Connell Street this Cathedral is small by comparison with other Irish Cathedrals. Still worth a visit and also shop located in the church.",
          "If you enjoy buildings with class and style this Cathedral is in outstanding condition inside and outside. It appears to be recently decorated to traditional standards inside and should you encounter one of its priests thsy will conduct a little tour- unofficially Im sure but",
          "If you haven't been around Europe and/or you're a architecture nut it maybe worth seeking out. There are many similar churches around ireland so this isn't a necessary stop by any means!",
          "I was struck by the archetecture and the amount of skill and effort it took to build such an edifice. Tradesmen who built St.Marys will never pass this way again",
          "I sang here, took part in a Carol Concert. It was pure magic. This is a wonder Cathedral and I have viisited many times since - I have told endless people about it and sent many along to visit",

          "Had the luck of visiting here two weeks ago, excellent example of a fine cathedral.",
          "This cathedral was most beautiful. Smack bang in the centre of town and only a small donation to enter. We didn't have enough change, and counted it out in front of the little old man at the front desk, who just let us in with the few coins we had. The building was so amazing,",
          "A medieval building with lots of interesting artefacts. Plaster render was removed to reveal bare stone walls, the building has a lot of character. Wonderful Altar and Choir stalls, dry acoustic and a difficult place to sing in Concert, but the atmosphere of the building makes",
          "Apparently the cathedral doesn't get any funding from the state, and it shows. The church has not been kept up as well as it could, apparently due to lack of funding, but it is worth a visit. It's a quick go through but if you like Romanesque cathedrals, you may enjoy this one.",
          "Well worth a visit - ideally, without the loudmouthed people we encountered while we were there.",
          "My choir did a concert for Christan Aid and Trocaire here. It was warmer than we expected (churches can be very cold!), but not as good as exp3ected to sing in as the walls were very crumbly and so no echo. Also there was only one toilet, way up stairs behind the choir, but",
          "900 years old, winding narrow passages up through the bell tower, you really do experience what it must have been like for soldiers and clergy alike hundreds of years ago. Incredibly, this is still a working building. Great team of campanoligists (bell ringers). Got a great",
          "We werenot aware that you could get in only a certain times so we missed out on getting to see the inside,However we did find time to look at some of the very well kept gravestons and great credit to those that look after this",

          "Superb place to visit - The history is just amazing - It's first Organ was installed in 1606, just amazing.",
          "I'm saying this is very good as opposed to excellent only because I can't speak of the interior as it was closed during our visit. The grounds were open and the cathedral looked very interesting. We would have liked to go inside but that was not possible. It is very old, dating",
          "Lovely old cathedral and well worth a visit. The stained glass is amazing",
          "Full of history, beautiful setting, ideal for a few hours browsing around and taking lots of photographs.",

          "As Cathedrals go, one is expected to see the usual outer characteristics . This Cathedral is so old that it has lots of inner secrets that one only realises when you get through the entrance . I will leave it as a surprise but I will give you only one clue \" The Columns\".",
          "I went to visit St. Mary's Cathedral in May 2011. I have been to this cathedral once before and it is well worth it to go. It is operated on donations and the suggested donation is \u20ac2. For this \u20ac2 you get a pamphlet explaining the history of the church. It is such a beautiful",
          "Saint Mary's Cathedral is the oldest building in Limerick which is still being used. Just for admiring the misericords and the altar of the cathedral it's worth a visit (and a donation!)",

          "For \u20ac2, you get given a pamphlet to guide you around this quaint Cathedral. It's not a huge place so only probably takes you about 30-40 mins to see the whole place, but you the information given is just right, enough to keep you interested without going over the top. Am not a",

        "wiki": "Limerick (; Irish: Luimneach [\u02c8l\u032a\u02e0\u026am\u02b2(\u0259)n\u02b2\u0259x]) is a city in County Limerick, Ireland. It is located in the Mid-West Region and is also part of the province of Munster. With a population of 94,192 at the 2016 census, Limerick is the third-most populous urban area in the state, and the fourth-most populous city on the island of Ireland. The city lies on the River Shannon, with the historic core of the city located on King's Island, which is bounded by the Shannon and Abbey Rivers. Limerick is also located at the head of the Shannon Estuary, where the river widens before it flows into the Atlantic Ocean. Limerick City and County Council is the local authority for the city.\n\n\n== Geography and political subdivisions ==\nAt the 2016 census, the Metropolitan District of Limerick had a population of 104,952. On 1 June 2014 following the merger of Limerick City and County Council, a new Metropolitan District of Limerick was formed within the united council, which extended the city area. The Metropolitan District includes the city urban area and extends outwards towards Patrickswell in the west and Castleconnell in the east. The City Metropolitan Area however excludes city suburbs located within County Clare.\nLimerick is one of the constituent cities of the Cork\u2013Limerick\u2013Galway corridor, which has a population of 1 million people. It is located at a strategic position on the River Shannon with four main crossing points near the city centre. To the south of the city is the Golden Vale, an area of rich pastureland. Historically, much of the city's industry was based on this rich agricultural hinterland, and it is particularly noted for Limerick ham.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient and medieval history ===\nLuimneach originally referred to the general area along the banks of the Shannon Estuary known as Loch Luimnigh. The earliest settlement in the city, Inis Sibhtonn, was the original name for King's Island during the pre-Viking and Viking eras. This island was also called Inis an Ghaill Duibh, 'The Dark-(haired) Foreigner's Island'. The name is recorded in Viking sources as Hlymrekr.\nThe city dates from 812; however, history suggests the presence of earlier settlements in the area surrounding King's Island, the island at the historical city centre. Antiquity's map-maker, Ptolemy, produced in 150 the earliest map of Ireland, showing a place called Regia at the same site as King's Island. History also records an important battle involving Cormac mac Airt in 221 and a visit by Saint Patrick in 434 to baptise an E\u00f3ganachta king, Carthann the Fair. Saint Munchin, the first bishop of Limerick died in 652, indicating the city was a place of some note. In 812 the Vikings sailed up the Shannon and pillaged the city, burned the monastery of Mungret but were forced to flee when the Irish attacked and killed many of their number. The Normans redesigned the city in the 12th century and added much of the most notable architecture, such as King John's Castle and St Mary's Cathedral.In early medieval times Limerick was at the centre of the Kingdom of Thomond which corresponds to the present day County Clare, the Kingdom also included North Kerry and parts of South Offaly. One of the kingdom's most notable kings was Brian Boru, ancestor of the O'Brien Clan of Dalcassians. The word Thomond is synonymous with the region and is retained in place names such as Thomondgate, Thomond Bridge and Thomond Park.\n\n\n=== Late Renaissance/Early modern history ===\n\nLimerick in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was often called the most beautiful city in Ireland. The English-born judge Luke Gernon, a resident of Limerick, wrote in 1620 that at his first sight of the city he had been amazed at its magnificence: \"lofty buildings of marble, like the Colleges in Oxford\".During the civil wars of the 17th century the city played a pivotal role, besieged by Oliver Cromwell in 1651 and twice by the Williamites in the 1690s. The Treaty of Limerick ended the Williamite war in Ireland which was fought between supporters of the Catholic King James II (Jacobites) and the Protestant King William of Orange (Williamites). The treaty offered toleration to Catholicism and full legal rights to Catholics that swore an oath of loyalty to William III and Mary II. The Treaty was of national significance as it ensured closer British and Protestant dominance over Ireland. The articles of the Treaty protecting Catholic rights were not passed by the Protestant Irish Parliament which rather updated the Penal Laws against Catholics which had major implications for Irish history. Reputedly the Treaty was signed on the Treaty Stone, an irregular block of limestone which once served as a mounting block for horses. This stone is now displayed on a pedestal at Clancy Strand. Because of the treaty, Limerick is sometimes known as the Treaty City. This turbulent period earned the city its motto: urbs antiqua fuit studisque asperrima belli (an ancient city well studied in the arts of war).\nThe peaceful times that followed the turmoil of the late 17th century allowed the city to prosper through trade in the late 18th century. During this time Limerick Port established itself as one of Ireland's major commercial ports exporting agricultural produce from one of Ireland's most fertile areas, the Golden Vale, to Britain and America. This increase in trade and wealth, particularly amongst the city's merchant classes saw a rapid expansion of the city as Georgian Limerick began to take shape. This gave the city its present-day look including the extensive terraced streets of Georgian townhouses which remain in the city centre today. The Waterford and Limerick Railway linked the city to the Dublin\u2013Cork railway line in 1848 and to Waterford in 1853. The opening of a number of secondary railways in the subsequent decades developed Limerick as a regional centre of communications.  However, the economic downturn in the European conflicts of the French Revolution and Napoleonic eras, and following the Act of Union 1800, and the impact of the Great Irish Famine of 1848 caused much of the 19th century to be a more troubled period.\n\n\n=== 20th-century history ===\n\nThe Limerick boycott was an economic boycott waged against the small Jewish community for over two years in the first decade of the 20th century. It was accompanied by a number of assaults, stone throwing and intimidation, which caused many Jews to leave the city. It was instigated in 1904 by a Redemptorist priest, Father John Creagh.\nDuring the Irish War of Independence, the Limerick Soviet was a self-declared soviet that existed from 15 to 27 April 1919. A general strike was organised by the Limerick Trades and Labour Council, as a protest against the British Army's declaration of a \"Special Military Area\" under the Defence of the Realm Act, which covered most of Limerick city and a part of the county. During the strike a special strike committee was set up to print their own money, control food prices and publish newspapers.\nBy the mid-20th century, Limerick was characterised by economic stagnation and decline as many traditional industries closed or left the city. However, there were some success stories. In 1942 Shannon Airport (located in County Clare, 20 km west of the city) opened for the first time offering transatlantic flights. In 1959, Shannon Airport enabled the opening of the Shannon Free Zone which attracted a large number of multinational companies to the region. A long campaign for a third level educational institute to be located in the city finally bore fruit with the establishment of NIHE Limerick in 1969 which eventually became the University of Limerick in 1989.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nThe local government area of Limerick city is under the jurisdiction of Limerick City and County Council. The Council has responsibility for local services such as sanitation, planning and development, libraries, collection of motor taxation, local roads and social housing in the city. The council comprises elected ward Councillors with an appointed full-time CEO as the city (and county) manager. Local elections are held every five years and the Councillors annually elect a Cathaoirleach or chairman to chair the council. As of 2015, the Cathaoirleach was Cllr Liam Galvin from the Newcastle West electoral area. The 21 Councillors from the 3 electoral districts in the City Metropolitan Area also elect a mayor to represent the city. The Mayoral position is largely ceremonial and has much reduced responsibility following the merger of the Limerick local authorities. Although the Mayor is the city's first citizen, within the council the position is below that of the Cathaoirleach. The current mayor is Councillor Jerry O'Dea. Former well-known mayors include TDs Donogh O'Malley, Stephen Coughlan, Michael Lipper, Jim Kemmy and Jan O'Sullivan.Throughout most of the city's history; from 1197 when it gained its first charter, Limerick City had its own local government authority, Limerick Corporation later known as Limerick City Council. The council was one of the oldest in Ireland and was only exceeded in age by Dublin City Council. In October 2012 the Government of Ireland published Putting People First- Action Programme for Effective Local Government which set out Government policy for reforms across all the main areas of local government in Ireland. Among the recommendations was the merging of Limerick City Council with Limerick County Council. The changes came into effect on 1 June 2014 following the implementation of the Local Government Reform Act 2014.By the 1960s onwards the city had outgrown its boundary considerably; the city boundary was only altered slightly and never reflected the overall urban area of the city. A limited boundary extension on the city's north side in 2008 enlarged the city boundary by 1,020 hectares increasing the city's area by almost 50% and raising the population by an estimated 7,000. The previous boundary, encompassing 2,086 hectares, was delineated in 1950. Newer suburban districts such as Dooradoyle, Castletroy \u2013 including the University, Gouldavoher, and Raheen were continually administered to by Limerick County Council until the merger of the two authorities in June 2014. This local government structure in Limerick caused a number of inefficiencies, most notably in the area of planning. A number of suburbs such as Westbury and Parteen to the north of the city are governed by Clare County Council.\nFollowing the merger of the two authorities in 2014 a new Metropolitan District of Limerick City was set up that included the city urban area and also settlements close to the city such as Patrickswell and Castleconnell. The Metropolitan district returns 21 Councillors to Limerick City and County Council which in total has 40 Councillors returned from across Limerick City and County. The Limerick City Metropolitan District is divided into 3 wards or electoral areas which are; Limerick City East, Limerick City North and Limerick City South which elect eight, six and seven Councillors respectively.Following the 2019 local elections, Fine Gael was the largest party on the united authority with 13 seats followed by Fianna F\u00e1il with 12, Labour with 3, Sinn F\u00e9in and the Green Party (Ireland) with 2 each, the Social Democrats with 1 seat, and Independents and other parties the remaining 6 seats.For national D\u00e1il elections Limerick City is in the Limerick City constituency. From 2011, the constituency boundaries changed in accordance with the proposals of the Constituency Commission and the subsequent Electoral (Amendment) Act 2009. This changed the electoral boundaries from Limerick East and Limerick West to Limerick City and Limerick. Limerick city encompasses the city, the suburban areas of Castletroy and as far east as Castleconnell. It also includes part of south County Clare. The Limerick county constituency takes in most of the rest of the county. For European parliament elections Limerick is in South Ireland.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nLimerick's climate is classified as temperate oceanic (K\u00f6ppen Cfb). Met \u00c9ireann maintains a climatological weather station at Shannon Airport, 20 kilometres west of the city in County Clare. Shannon Airport records an average of 977 millimetres of precipitation annually, most of which is rain. Limerick has a mild climate, with the average daily maximum in July of 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) and the average daily minimum in January of 3 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F). The highest temperature recorded was 32.0 \u00b0C (89.6 \u00b0F) in June 2018, and the lowest \u221211.4 \u00b0C (11.5 \u00b0F) in 2010. Limerick is the cloudiest city in the state, averaging only 1,295 sunshine hours annually, 3.5 hours of sunshine every day. There are on average 62 days of no recordable sunshine, 6 days of thunder, 22 days of hail and 11 days of snow per year. Shannon Airport is located by the ocean at an elevation of 14 metres, so snow is less common at the station than in the city itself.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn 2014, Limerick became Ireland's inaugural National City of Culture, with a variety of artistic and cultural events occurring at locations around the city throughout the year.\nThe Limerick City Gallery of Art on Pery Square is the city's chief venue for contemporary art exhibitions. It is home to a permanent collection of Irish art, which shows works from the early 18th to 20th century. The gallery houses the National Collection of Contemporary Drawing founded by the artist Samuel Walsh in 1987. Limerick's major contemporary art event is EVA International, Ireland's Biennial of Contemporary Art. EVA International, centered mainly in the Limerick City Gallery of Art, is curated by varying guest curators and includes contemporary artworks by both international and Irish artists.The Lime Tree Theatre officially opened at the Mary Immaculate College campus in October 2012. The venue hosts theatre, music, comedy, traditional arts, schools' performances and conferences.The Belltable Arts Centre on O'Connell Street hosts local playwrights and drama productions. The University Concert Hall located in UL is a 1,000 seat venue and provides a large venue for national and international acts to visit the city. Limerick is also the home of street theatre companies, including \"The Umbrella Project\".\nLimerick's literature scene is supported by projects like the Limerick Writers' Centre, which was established in 2008 and runs a range of writing activities in the city. Limerick natives include Pulitzer Prize winning author, Frank McCourt; novelists Kate O'Brien, Michael Curtin, Kevin Barry and Donal Ryan. Poets from Limerick include Michael Hogan, Desmond O'Grady, and John Liddy.Other Limerick arts groups include Contact Studios, which provides individual studio spaces for visual artists; the Daghdha Dance Company, a contemporary dance company that has adopted a renovated church in John's Square, adjacent to St John's Cathedral, as a performance space); the Fresh Film Festival, which is held each spring, and includes films made by young people (7\u201318 years); Impact Theatre Company; and Limerick Printmakers Studio and Gallery, which provides printmaking facilities, a venue for exhibitions and events and an education programme. The Limerick Youth Theatre provides young people with an opening into acting and production.The Irish Chamber Orchestra and the Irish World Music Centre are both based in the University of Limerick. The university has a thousand-seat state-of-the-art concert hall that hosts visiting performers. The city's music scene has produced bands such as The Cranberries, guitarist Noel Hogan's MonoBand, The Hitchers and others. Electronic musician Richard D. James, more commonly known as Aphex Twin, was born in Limerick in 1971. The Limerick Art Gallery and the Art College cater for painting, sculpture and performance art.\nLimerick is also home to comedians The Rubberbandits, D'Unbelievables (Pat Shortt and Jon Kenny) and Karl Spain. Dolan's Warehouse on the Dock Road is a venue specialising in live music, established in 1998. Baker Place was a nightclub that held mainly local underground nights until its closure in 2011. In 2020, it was announced that the Dromkeen-based Shiloh Trust was seeking planning permission to convert the former premises of Baker Place into a bible school. The Crush 87 nightclub (formerly known as Trinity Rooms until its closure in 2010), was relaunched in 2013.The city is the setting for Frank McCourt's memoir Angela's Ashes and the film adaptation. The Frank McCourt Museum situated in Frank's former school on Hartsonge Street opened in 2011 and contains artefacts from the book. Limerick has also been the setting or location for a number of other films, including the dramas The Real Thing (2002), Cowboys & Angels (2003) and Lost & Found (2015).Riverfest is a summer festival held annually in Limerick since 2004. The 2014 festival was held in May and had a record 80,000 visitors.\n\n\n== Humorous verse ==\nA limerick is a type of humorous verse of five lines with an AABBA rhyme scheme: the poem's connection with the city is obscure, but the name is generally taken to be a reference to Limerick city or County Limerick, sometimes particularly to the Maigue Poets, and may derive from an earlier form of nonsense verse parlour game that traditionally included a refrain that included \"Will [or won't] you come (up) to Limerick?\" The earliest known use of the name \"Limerick\" for this type poem is an 1880 reference, in a Saint John, New Brunswick newspaper, to an apparently well-known tune.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Broadcasting ===\nRT\u00c9 lyric fm, a state-run classical music radio station and part of RT\u00c9, broadcasts nationally from studios in the city centre on Cornmarket Square which opened in 1994. Limerick's local radio station is Live 95FM, broadcasting from 'Radio House', near the waterfront at Steamboat Quay. Spin South West, owned by Communicorp, broadcasts to Counties Kerry, Clare, Limerick, Tipperary and southwest Laois from its studios at Landmark Buildings in the Raheen Industrial Estate. Student radio station, Wired FM, broadcasts on 99.9FM from Mary Immaculate College. Wired FM also has studios in Limerick Institute of Technology. University Hospital Limerick has a radio station on 94.2FM, but this can be heard only in the hospital and surrounding area. West Limerick 102 is broadcast from Newcastle West. The national broadcaster, RT\u00c9, has radio and television studios in the city, which are periodically used to broadcast programming from Limerick.\n\n\n=== Print ===\nSeveral local newspapers are published in the city, including The Limerick Post and The Limerick Leader and magazines include the Limerick Event Guide, Business Limerick and Limerick Now.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\nLimerick city is approximately 25 km from Shannon Airport. Tourist attractions in the city centre include Limerick City Museum, King John's Castle (1210), St Mary's Cathedral (1168), the Hunt Museum, the University of Limerick, Georgian houses and gardens and the Treaty Stone.  There are several seasonal tours, including Angela's Ashes walking tour of Limerick City, historical walking tour, and boat tours along the River Shannon.\nThe city centre is divided between the traditional areas of \"English Town\" on the southern end of King's Island, which includes the King John's Castle; \"Irish Town\", which includes the older streets on the south bank; and the current economic centre further south, called \"Newtown Pery\". Newtown Pery was built in the late 18th century before the Act of Union and, unusually for an Irish city and unique in Limerick, is laid out on a grid plan. The Limerick City Museum (formerly aka the Jim Kemmy Municipal Museum), is located in Istabraq Hall, City Hall, Merchant's Quay. It contains displays on Limerick's history and manufactures.\n\nThe Georgian core of the city, with its Georgian architecture in the Newtown Pery, was developed from the mid 18th century. This core includes O'Connell Street (George Street before independence) from the Cecil Street intersection running to the south west end of the Crescent, and south-east to Pery Street including Glentworth Street and Barrington Street. Other buildings of architectural note in the city are St John's Cathedral, designed by the notable Victorian architect, Philip Charles Hardwick. St Mary's Cathedral, at over 800 years old, is one of the oldest in Ireland. St John's Cathedral, whilst more modern, has Ireland's tallest spire at 94 m (308 ft).\nThe Hunt Museum is based in the historic 18th-century former Custom House. The museum was established to house a collection of approximately 2000 works of art and antiquities formed by John and Gertrude Hunt during their lifetimes.\nThe main park in Limerick is the People's Park which was opened in 1877 in memory of Richard Russell, a prominent local business man. The park is dominated by the Thomas Spring Rice memorial (MP for the city 1820\u20131832) and has a large collection of mature deciduous and evergreen trees.\nLimerick city centre changed significantly with the construction of several modern high-rise buildings in the early 2000s, in particular as part of the regeneration of the former docks area along the Dock Road. The suburban areas, where the majority of the population now live, have grown out from the centre along the main roads to Ennis (North Circular and Ennis Road areas/Caherdavin), Dublin (Castletroy and the University) and Cork (Ballinacurra/Dooradoyle/Raheen). Suburban houses are generally two-floor semi-detached homes for single families. These were built from the 1950s onwards in large estates by government projects and commercial developments, although there are many examples of Edwardian and older 1930s suburban homes on the main suburban thoroughfares leading towards the city (North & South Circular, Ballinacurra Road, O'Connell Avenue).\n\nLimerick city's nightlife is supported by a number of nightclubs and pubs which offer music. For example, Dolan's Warehouse is a small music venue which hosts local, national and international folk, indie, jazz, rock and traditional Irish music acts.In County Limerick, Adare village and the Foynes Flying Boat Museum, approximately 35 km (22 miles/30 minutes) from Limerick City along the scenic coastal N69 route from Limerick to Tralee, are also attractions. Bunratty Castle in County Clare is another local attraction, and is situated 15.4 km north of the city. Limerick is known to be the antipodes to the Campbell Islands of New Zealand.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nLimerick is the third largest city in Ireland (after Dublin and Cork) with a population of 94,192 in the urban area and 104,952 in the metropolitan district, according to the 2016 CSO census. The past census reported a large population decline in central city areas due in part to the Limerick regeneration process where in these areas the largest reduction was reported nationally and also to outward migration following the collapse of the local and national economy from 2008 onwards. The population of the Limerick Larger Urban Zone as defined by the EU is 162,413. The ethnic diversity in Limerick's population, which includes a large immigrant community, saw rapid growth during the Celtic Tiger and the following decade. The Polish community is one of the largest demographic groups in the Municipal District, with approximately 4,000 living and working in the area. Ireland's first Polish bank opened in 2007. The African community has set up a number of churches, which are now part of the cultural makeup of the city.Limerick has a large stock of local authority housing. Prior to the merger of Limerick City and County Council 41% of all housing within the old Limerick City Council boundary was local authority, which was the highest in Ireland. This figure is however no longer accurate given the larger metropolitan district of the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nLimerick is in the region dubbed \"the Midwest\". Also known as the \"Shannon Region\", this is primarily an economic and social concept. The region encompasses County Limerick, County Clare, North County Tipperary, Northwest County Kerry and south County Offaly, with its focal point centred on Limerick and its environs within an 8-kilometre (5 mi) radius.\nThe area is the main economic region in Ireland outside Dublin and Cork. Its economic development has been driven in part by the University of Limerick, Limerick Institute of Technology, Shannon Airport in County Clare and Shannon Development (an economic development agency), whose precursor was SFADCO (Shannon Free Airport Development Company), an economic agency that provided tax incentives to companies locating in the area surrounding Shannon Airport. As of 2006 Shannon Development was mostly concerned with disposing of valuable industrial park properties. Limerick Chamber of Commerce, a representative body for businesses in the region, celebrated its bicentennial/bicentenary in 2015.\nHistorically Limerick was an agricultural commodity-driven economy, due to its position as the first major port along the River Shannon. By the middle of the 18th century, Limerick Port grew to become one of Ireland's principal commercial ports, exporting agricultural produce from the most fertile tracts in Ireland known as the Golden Vale as well as produce from the surrounding counties. The city was one of the main meat processing areas in Ireland, and industry included confectionery and flour production. The city was known for its bacon industry \u2013 however this went into decline in the mid-20th century. The fishing industry in Limerick, based on Clancy's Strand opposite King John's Castle and at Coonagh nearby, once employed hundreds of men. The boat most commonly used was the Gandelow which was also used as a small Lighter (barge) to ferry goods to and from larger ships in the port. In the 1920s the construction of a dam at Ardnacrusha severely impacted salmon breeding and that, and the introduction of quotas, had by the 1950s caused salmon fishing to diminish. By 2006, most fishermen had relinquished their drift net licences and the industry can now be said to be dormant.As with other cities in Ireland, a number of multinational companies are based in Limerick, and the city is a growing recipient of foreign direct investment. Dell had its main European Manufacturing Facility at the Raheen Business Park however in January 2009 Dell announced that it would close its Limerick computer manufacturing plant and move the production lines to Poland. The facility was the largest Dell manufacturing plant outside the United States and produced 30,000\u201360,000 units per day for export to the EMEA. Dell remains one of the largest employers in the mid-west with over 1,000 people employed in service and support. Analog Devices has its European manufacturing base in Raheen, 3 km south-west of the city centre. The site employs more than 1,000 people. Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Vistakon (the world's largest manufacturer of contact lenses) has a large facility in Castletroy in the National Technology Park and also employs close to 1,000 people. It is Vistakon's only production facility outside the United States and one of the largest contact-lens manufacturing plants in the world. Cook Medical, the world's largest privately owned Medical Devices company, employs over 800 people in Limerick at the National Technology Park.\nThe Post-2008 Irish economic downturn had a profound effect on Limerick. The announcement in 2009 that Dell was to move its manufacturing facility from Limerick to Poland devastated the local economy. 1,900 jobs were lost at Dell and it is believed that for every job that was lost at Dell at least another 4 to 5 were at risk. The closure of the Dell manufacturing facility amounted to 2% of Ireland's national GDP. The downturn in the construction industry also cost many jobs as did the stalled Limerick regeneration programme which promised investment in Limerick's deprived city areas. As of 2012 unemployment had become a major problem across the city with the unemployment rate in the city at 28.6% which was almost twice the national average.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nThe Crescent Shopping Centre is the largest shopping centre in Ireland, outside of Dublin, and the largest in the province of Munster. It is located in Dooradoyle about 3 km south of the city centre, and has over 90 shopping outlets along with restaurants and a 12-screen Omniplex Cinema. The city centre also has a large retail district which includes a mix of more traditional type of shops as well as some modern high street stores. Cruises Street is one of the main shopping streets. O'Connell Street, William Street, Bedford Row and Thomas Street) are also retail streets within the city. The city centre saw some works on remodelling in the early 21st century, with pedestrianisation works on Bedford Row, Thomas Street and parts of Catherine Street, as well as widening footpaths on William Street. These works have sought to address a reduction of footfall in the city centre (in turn influencing the closure of many city centre retail businesses) which occurred from the recession of 2008 onwards.\n\n\n==== Retail parks and shopping centres ====\n\nDuring the Celtic Tiger years a number of shopping centres and retail parks opened in suburban areas of Limerick. In addition to the Crescent Shopping Centre, which expanded in the early 2000s, the Jetland Shopping Centre opened in Caherdavin in 2005. The Childers Road Retail Park and the Parkway Shopping Centre in the east of the city also have a number of high street stores. Unfinished retail centres include the Coonagh Cross retail development and the Parkway Valley Shopping Centre on the Dublin Road. A proposed but unapproved retail development project, the Opera Centre, makes up part of the \"Limerick 2030\" scheme.\n\n\n==== The Milk Market ====\nThe Milk Market located at Cornmarket Row in the city centre sells locally produced foods and products and is governed by Limerick Market Trustees. In 2010 work was undertaken to redevelop the existing premises to an all-weather, all year round facility as it operated in an outdoor environment. The work involved constructing a large canopy over the existing market premises and was officially re-opened in June 2010. The Milk Market Project won the 2011 Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI) 'Peoples Choice Award'.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nIn 2013, a renewable energy strategy was launched for the region, and proposed a 20% reduction in CO2-emissions, while ensuring that short-term actions were beneficial to the long-term goal of 100% renewable energy. The strategy was completed by the Danish Aalborg University.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\nShannon Airport is 20 km west of the city in County Clare. It is one of Ireland's main airports and is easily accessible from Limerick via the N18 dual carriageway and from other regions via the Limerick Tunnel. It has scheduled flights to European and North American destinations. Airlines using the airport include Ryanair, Aer Lingus, United Airlines, American Airlines, Aer Lingus Regional and Delta Air Lines. There is no rail link to the airport. Coonagh airfield, a few kilometres west of Caherdavin, serves small private aircraft. Kerry and Cork Airports are around 1 hour 30 minutes and 2 hours drive away, respectively. Kerry Airport is connected to Farranfore railway station, from Limerick railway station travel via Limerick Junction and Mallow.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nLocal public transport is provided by several companies. Bus \u00c9ireann, Ireland's state-owned bus company, operates a number of services subsidised by the National Transport Authority, while a number of provide operators also run commercial bus services in and around Limerick. An updated city bus network was introduced in Limerick City in December 2016, which introduced new routes. In May 2019, Bus \u00c9ireann further changed and improved the Limerick City timetable, including increased frequency and later operating times.\nOther rural buses run to towns and villages in the county and to Shannon Airport. There are also a number of Intercity and international buses from Bus \u00c9ireann's bus terminal adjoining Limerick Colbert railway station. These include hourly services to Dublin, Cork, Ennis and Galway. Bus \u00c9ireann have also commenced a Limerick to Galway Express service travelling on the M18 in addition to the regular service. Buses run every 2 hours to Tralee and Killarney. There are also regular daily services to Waterford and Athlone, and a daily service to London via the ferry from Rosslare Europort.\nThere are a number of private bus companies in operation providing city and intercity services. Dublin Coach provide the M7 express service which operates every hour from Arthur's Quay which goes to Dublin or Ennis. JJ Kavanagh also provide Dublin to Limerick services from Arthur's Quay. Citylink run a number of services from Limerick to Galway and Cork and operate from Henry Street.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nIarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann's Limerick Colbert station is the railway hub for the city and the Mid West Region with a number of intercity and commuter rail services. Limerick railway station opened on 28 August 1858, replacing an earlier, temporary station 500 m east, which had operated from 9 May 1848.The following inter city routes are available from Limerick Colbert station :\n\nLimerick to Dublin Heuston: 16 services daily including 4 direct services. All remaining Dublin \u2013 Limerick services require passengers to change to the Dublin to Cork train at either Limerick Junction or at Ballybrophy railway station.\nLimerick to Waterford: 2 services daily (but none on Sundays). Passengers must change train at Limerick Junction to continue to Waterford with stations at Tipperary, Cahir, Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir.\nLimerick to Galway: 5 services daily. This service reopened on 29 March 2010.\nLimerick to Cork: Passengers can travel between Limerick and Cork via Limerick Junction. There is no direct service.\nLimerick to Killarney, Farranfore and Tralee: Passengers can travel between Limerick and Killarney, Farranfore and Tralee via Limerick Junction where trains run via Mallow to reach County Kerry.There are 3 suburban/commuter services in the Limerick Suburban Rail network:\n\nLimerick \u2013 Ennis calling at Sixmilebridge\nLimerick \u2013 Nenagh calling at Castleconnell and Birdhill (with some services continuing to Cloughjordan & Roscrea & connecting to the Dublin-Cork railway line at Ballybrophy.) Due to speed restrictions this alternative Dublin \u2013 Limerick route can take 60 minutes longer (with a change at Ballybrophy) than by Limerick Junction albeit a more direct service.\nLimerick \u2013 Limerick Junction and ThurlesThere are also a number of disused railway lines including the Limerick to Foynes line which closed to freight in the early 2000s, having lost passenger services in the early 1960s, although the track is still in situ.  This is the last remaining part of the North Kerry Line which closed to passenger traffic in the early 1960s and to freight traffic (other than Limerick \u2013 Foynes) in the mid-1970s, and has been lifted between Ballingrane (near Rathkeale) and Tralee.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nLimerick's central location in the mid\u2013west of Ireland means many national primary routes converge on the city. The M7 (Dublin), N/M18 (Galway, Ennis, Shannon), N/M20 (Cork), N21 (Tralee) and N24 (Waterford) routes all start/terminate in or near the city. Road infrastructure is further supplemented by the southern ring road and Limerick Tunnel bypass of the city and the M20 bypass of Dooradoyle and Raheen to the south of the city. Connections to the other cities were improved with the completion of the M7 motorway in December 2010, and continuing upgrades ongoing to the N/M18 to Shannon, Ennis, Galway and Tuam \u2013 the final section opened in September 2017. A motorway is also planned between Cork and Limerick, with a proposed completion date in the mid 2020s.\n\n\n=== Waterway transport ===\nHistorically, waterway transport has been key to Limerick's development. Vikings established the city as a maritime trading port. The city's position on a major Irish river system, the Shannon, enabled transport to the midlands of Ireland and further north and west. By the 18th century with the opening of canal systems throughout Ireland, Limerick Port established itself as Ireland's premier commercial port on the western side of the country. This was enabled by ease of access from the facilitated by the opening of canals but most importantly to the River Shannon. The opening of the Grand Canal in the 18th century provided further access to Dublin and the east of the country. There are also a number of disused canals in the vicinity of the city including the Park Canal & the Passey \u2013 Errina Canal on the old Limerick navigation. Waterway transport on the Shannon was regularly used to transport goods from Limerick to Dublin and vice versa however this mode of transport fell into decline in the 20th century. Originally Limerick port was located near the confluence of the Abbey and Shannon rivers at King's Island. Today the Shannon Foynes Port is located further downstream on the Shannon alongside the Dock Road. This general purpose facility port is operated by the Shannon Foynes Port Company who operate all marine activities in the Shannon estuary.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nLimerick is a centre of higher education in the region, and technical and continuation education within the city traces its beginning back to the formation of the Limerick Athenaeum Society in 1852, marking the foundation of the Limerick Institute of Technology.  The Society's aims included \"the promotion of Literature, Science, Art and Music\".Today, Limerick is home to a number of higher-education institutions including the University of Limerick, Limerick Institute of Technology and Mary Immaculate College and has a student population of over 20,000.The University of Limerick (UL), has a student population of over 13,000, and is about 5 km east of the city centre in the suburb of Castletroy. It was established as the National Institute for Higher Education (NIHE) in 1972, and in 1989 was the first university to be established since the foundation of the State in 1922. Its academic programs include courses in engineering, information technology, materials science, sports science, humanities, teacher education, social sciences and music. In 2007, the university opened a medical school. The Irish World Music Centre specialises in traditional music and dance, and UL is host to the Irish Chamber Orchestra. The campus includes a 50m Olympic-standard swimming complex, the first to be established in Ireland. The University has one of the longest footbridges in Europe, called \"The Living Bridge\", designed by Wilkinson Eyre Architects of London. Thomond College of Education, Limerick was a teacher training college for secondary level and was integrated into the university in 1991.\nLimerick Institute of Technology (LIT) has a student population of 7,000 and is a centre for undergraduate and postgraduate education in business, engineering, information technology, humanities, science and art education. The main campus is located at Moylish Park, about 3 kilometres north-west of the city centre, and the Limerick School of Art and Design is located on campuses at Clare Street and George's Quay. Additional facilities and outreach centres are located at O'Connell Street and in Ennis, Co. Clare and LIT has two campuses in Co. Tipperary, LIT Thurles and LIT Clonmel. These were formerly the campuses of the Tipperary Institute which merged with LIT in 2011.LIT was originally established in 1852 as a School of Ornamental Art.  In the mid-1970s it was incorporated as the Limerick College of Art, Commerce & Technology (CoACT) and achieved the designation of a Regional Technical College (RTC) in 1993 and finally an Institute of Technology in 1997. The Institute has a sporting ethos, and is located adjacent to Thomond Park and the Gaelic Grounds. It has connections to several enterprise centres: The National Franchise Centre; Croom Community Enterprise Centre; Thurles Chamber Enterprise Centre (TCEC); The Hartnett Enterprise Acceleration Centre (HEAC). Two further enterprise centres, the Enterprise and Research Centre, Clonmel and the Irish Fashion Incubator Limited (IFIL) were due to be added to its \"Enterprise Ladder\" in 2013. LIT is also home to the Millennium Theatre, a northside venue for shows and concerts.\nMary Immaculate College is an education and arts college located just south-west of the city centre. The main focus is on the education of primary-level teachers.

The college was established in 2006 when the Mid West Business Institute was acquired by Griffith College. The college runs full-time and part-time courses in accountancy, business, law, engineering, computing and IT and has a range of part-time courses available.\nPrimary and secondary education in the city is organised in a similar fashion to the rest of Ireland. The City of Limerick Vocational Education Committee (CLVEC) provides education services for over 10,000 learners in the city at secondary and further education levels. It also runs Gaelchol\u00e1iste Luimnigh, an all Irish language secondary school. The other main secondary schools in the city are Castletroy College, Crescent College Comprehensive, Thomond Community College and Villiers which are all co-educational.

The city and suburbs also has many tennis, athletics, cricket and golf clubs. The city is host to many large sporting events. Examples in the 21st century include the 2008 and 2009 Irish Open Golf Championships, the 2010 Irish Special Olympics, the All-Ireland Corporate Games and the World Baton twirling Championships. Limerick was designated as a European City of Sport for 2011 by the European Capitals of Sport Association (ACES).\nThe National Elite Swimming Club is based in The University of Limerick Arena.\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\nSimilar to the rest of Ireland, basketball was a popular sport in Limerick during the 1970s and 1980s, with up to four divisions in the men's and women's local leagues. It suffered a decline during the 1990s culminating in the complete demise of local league basketball in the city and surrounding areas. The main clubs in the city were St. Colm's and Marathon with St. Colm's in particular having a long history in the National Leagues. Limerick is currently represented in the National Leagues by the men's UL Eagles team and the women's UL Aughinish team.

Adare also played host to the Irish Open in 2007 and 2008.\n\n\n=== Rugby ===\n\nRugby Union is very popular in the city and is widely played at all levels. Limerick is often referred to as the home of Irish rugby.

Limerick FC first joined the league in 1937 and has been involved since then, although there have been a number of variations of the club. Their most successful period was from the 1960s to the 1980s when they won 2 League of Ireland championships and two FAI Cups. The club played at Markets Field until the mid-1980s when they controversially moved to a new venue. A period of declining fortunes and a nomadic existence followed. As of 2019, the club is playing in the League of Ireland Premier Division, the top tier of Irish football. Limerick FC returned to the Market's Field on 5 June 2015, following the purchase of the venue by the Limerick Enterprise Development Partnership (LEDP) from Bord na gCon, the Irish greyhound racing authority. The purchase was funded by a donation from the JP McManus Charitable Foundation.\n\n\n=== Horse racing ===\nLimerick Racecourse is located 10 km outside the city at Greenmount, Patrickswell and holds flat and National Hunt meetings throughout the year.\n\n\n=== Boxing ===\nFormer World Boxing Champion, Andy Lee, who held the WBO middleweight title from 2014 to 2015, is from Limerick.\n\n\n== Photos ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Limerick people\nList of towns and villages in the Republic of Ireland\nList of public art in Limerick\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLimerick City and County Council\nOfficial Limerick City Website\nVarious online history resources from Limerick City Library",

          "This museum is a an interesting place offering a good backgriound to the river city. I am a native of Limerick but only saw the museum on my 4th attempt thanks to the absolutely ludicrous idea of keeping the museum closed on Saturday and Sunday. That is a bizarre and inexcusable",

          "I remember when the museum was housed in Johns Square there seemed to be much more in it. This is a very small collection and while it has a few interesting exhibits it hardly warrants existence by itself. It would be better being moved inside King Johns castle. Disappointing,",

        "wiki": "The Treaty of Limerick (Irish: Conradh Luimnigh), signed on 3 October 1691, ended the 1689 to 1691 Williamite War in Ireland, a conflict related to the 1688 to 1697 Nine Years' War. It consisted of two separate agreements, one with military terms of surrender, signed by commanders of a French expeditionary force and Irish Jacobites loyal to the exiled James II. Baron de Ginkell, leader of government forces in Ireland, signed on behalf of William III and his wife Mary II. It allowed Jacobite units to be transported to France, the diaspora known as the Flight of the Wild Geese. \nThe other set out conditions for those who remained, including guarantees of religious freedom for Catholics, and retention of property for those who remained in Ireland. Many were subsequently altered, or ignored, establishing the Protestant Ascendancy that dominated Ireland until 1916.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nWilliam's victory at the Battle of Boyne in July 1690 was less decisive than appeared at the time, Jacobite losses being around 2,000 out of a force of 25,000. That assumption formed the basis of the Declaration of Finglas, largely dictated by Irish Protestants; it offered the Jacobite rank and file amnesty, but by excluding senior officers, threatened another round of land confiscations. The war continued, with French victories in the Low Countries briefly increasing hopes of a Stuart restoration. \nThe Jacobites established a defensive line along the Shannon, and repulsed attempts to capture Limerick and Athlone. However, Connacht and County Kerry could not feed an additional 20,000 soldiers, plus refugees, while the loss of the south western ports of Kinsale and Cork made resupply from France extremely difficult. By spring 1691, both soldiers and civilians were starving.Although the English Parliament was divided politically, all parties broadly agreed on the need to re-establishing the pre-1685 settlement. In fact, Parliament wanted more resources dedicated to Ireland than William, who viewed it as secondary to the war in Europe. In 1691, French preparations for an offensive in the Low Countries led William to authorise De Ginkell to offer whatever terms were necessary to make peace. This caused conflict later on. \nJacobite strategy was impacted by internal divisions James II saw Ireland as a distraction, a perspective shared by many of the English and Scots exiles. For the French, it was a way to divert Williamite resources, and their approach was purely military. After the Boyne, they recommended Dublin be destroyed, and argued Limerick should not be defended; they withdrew to Galway in September 1690, and many of their troops returned to France.\nThe Irish Jacobites were broadly divided into a pro-war faction, headed by Sarsfield, who argued military victory was still possible, and those led by Tyrconnell, who advocated negotiating peace while they still retained an army. In May, a French convoy reached Limerick with additional French troops, arms and provisions but lack of transport meant most of it remained in the port.\n\n\n== The Military Articles ==\nThese articles dealt with the treatment of the disbanded Jacobite army. Under the treaty, Jacobite soldiers in formed regiments had the option to leave with their arms and flags for France to continue serving under James II in the Irish Brigade. Some 14,000 Jacobites chose this option and were marched south to Cork where they embarked on ships for France, many of them accompanied by their wives and children. Individual soldiers wanting to join the French, Spanish or Austrian armies also emigrated in what became known as the Flight of the Wild Geese.\nThe Jacobite soldiers also had the option of joining the Williamite army. 1,000 soldiers chose this option. The Jacobite soldiers thirdly had the option of returning home which some 2,000 soldiers chose.\nThis treaty had twenty-nine articles, which were agreed upon between Lieutenant-General Ginkle, Commander-in-Chief of the English army, and the Lieutenant-Generals D'Usson and de Tess\u00e9, Commanders-in-Chief of the Irish army. The articles were signed by D'Usson, Le Chevalier de Tesse, Latour Montfort, Patrick Sarsfield (Earl of Lucan), Colonel Nicholas Purcell of Loughmoe, Mark Talbot, and Piers, Viscount Galmoy.\n\n\n== The Civil Articles ==\nThese articles protected the rights of the defeated Jacobite landed gentry who chose to remain in Ireland, most of whom were Catholics. Their property was not to be confiscated so long as they swore allegiance to William III and Mary II, and Catholic noblemen were to be allowed to bear arms. William required peace in Ireland and was allied to the Papacy in 1691 within the League of Augsburg.\nThis Treaty contained thirteen articles which were agreed upon between the Right Honourable Sir Charles Porter, and Thomas Coningsby, 1st Earl Coningsby, Lord Justice of Ireland, and his Excellency the Baron de Ginkel, Lieutenant General and Commander-in-Chief of the English army, and the Right Honourable Patrick Sarsfield, Earl of Lucan, Piers, Viscount Galmoy, Colonel Nicholas Purcell of Loughmoe, Colonel Nicholas Cusack, Sir Toby Butler (who was the actual draftsman), Colonel  Garrett Dillon, and Colonel John Brown. The treaty was signed by Charles Porter, Thomas Coningsby, and Baron de Ginkel, and witnessed by Scavenmoer, H. Mackay, and T. Talmash.\nIt has been said that \"the ink was not dry on the Treaty\" before the English broke it\u2014the civil articles were not honoured by the victorious Williamite government. The few Catholic landowners who took the oath in 1691-93 remained protected, including their descendants. Those who did not were known as \"non-jurors\", and their loyalty to the new regime was automatically suspect. Some managed to have an outlawry specifically reversed, such as the 8th Viscount Dillon in 1694, or the Earl of Clanricarde in 1701.\nThe Papacy again recognized James II as the lawful king of Ireland from 1693. From 1695 this provoked a series of harsh penal laws to be enacted by the Parliament of Ireland, to make it difficult for the Irish Catholic gentry who had not taken the oath by 1695 to remain Catholic. The laws were extended for political reasons by the Dublin administration during the War of the Spanish Succession (1701\u201314), and reforms did not start until the 1770s.\nIt is often thought that Limerick was the only treaty between Jacobites and Williamites. A similar treaty had been signed on the surrender of Galway on 22 July 1691, but without the strict loyalty oath required under the Treaty of Limerick. The Galway garrison had been organised by the mostly-Catholic landed gentry of counties Galway and Mayo, who benefited from their property guarantees in the following century. The Limerick treaty marked the end of the war.\n\n\n== The Williamite Settlement forfeitures ==\nIn the following 8 years further confiscations were made from the continuing adherents to the Jacobite cause, and also further pardons were granted. The Commissioners of Forfeitures reported to the Irish House of Commons in December 1699 as follows:\n3,921 named persons had been outlawed initially, who owned\n1,060,792 acres\nthat produced rents of \u00a3211,623 a year, and were worth \u00a34,685,130 10sOf these,\n\n491 had been pardoned in accord with the treaties at Cavan and Limerick, and 792 otherwise; Some of the remaining 2,638 persons or their families had had property restored.\nUltimately the total amount received by the Commissioners was: 752,953 acres paying rents of \u00a3135,793 p.a., worth \u00a31,699,343. A further \u00a3300,000 in chattels and \u00a31,092,000 of forestry had been seized, along with several hundred individual houses.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Limerick\nList of treaties\nSieges of Limerick\nBattle of the Boyne\nIrish of Nantes\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nChilds, John (2008).

          "Historical significance but a big stone at the end of the day. Maybe a wash of it would clean it up. Still just a rock.",
          "Well worth the short walk from the castle and great photo opportunity too. It gave me a deeper insight into the history of Limerick",
          "While this holds a historic spot in Irish history, it is rather underwhelming to the average tourist. It is, however, across the Shannon River from King John\u2019s castle and as long as you are there, you might as well walk across the bridge and take a look at it.",

          "The stone is situated on the River Shannon and marks the spot where the Treaty of Limerick was signed in 1691 by William of Orange and James II. James was defeated and William the victor. Attempts to return a Catholic monarch to the throne of England failed. The treaty did",

          "The history of the Treaty Stone is cool but when you read the signs explaining it, you feel frustration realizing that the treaty was broken soon after the signing. But it is an important part of history. On a side note, it was moved about 40 yards from its original location",
          "This may be just a rock on a pedestal but it's a great way to see a very important piece of Irish history! Since it's a pleasant walk right across the River Shannon on Thomond Bridge from King John's Castle you get great views of the river and the castle too!",

          "The treaty stone is very easy to miss is you are just walking around. We almost did. We walked on this side of the Shannon to get to King John's Castle, and then on a walking tour, our guide brought us back over the bridge to point out the stone and explain the history.",
          "Wandered past the treaty stone as we were walking along the riverbank and this is a reminder to all of the treaty signed at the end of the Williamite war in 1691",

          "The treat you stone symbolises the history of limerick city and stands alone without ceremony along by the river at the far side of the bridge from St. John's castle. You could easily pass it without taking note of it's a significance!",
          "My fiance and I were killing time before heading to Shannon airport by wandering around Limerick. We stumbled across the stone after crossing the river near St John's Castle. There is a small notice board nearby which gives you a brief history of the stone - it's worth reading",
          "ok, it's just a stone, but it's historic importance to Ireland cannot be overemphasised. for anyone interested in the politics and religious divisions in Irekand toady THIS stone explains why.",
          "Great views from this part of Limerick as you have King Johns castle right beside this stone, Curraghgower Bar just a few feet from this stone and The Hunt Museum across the river! Definitely a must see part of Limerick City for tourists! Locals will be used to walking past this",
          "I visited the treaty stone at night, it is well preserved. It's right across the river from King John's Castle. I sat on bench and enjoyed great views of the River Shannon. Even not the most spectacular attraction in Limerick but the significance is extraordinary, representation",
          "There was mild hype about this thing. We happened upon it when out for a walk from our hotel. Its just a stone monument on the side of the road. The history behind it is interesting but it was underwhelming.",
          "Treat stone near King johns castle is a must visit for tourists interested in Irish history. The stone allegedly used to sign the treaty is preserved their to see. Excellent articles of information on display to pass clear information on the happenings of around the 1690's",
          "This Treaty Stone represents a very strong period of Irish History and in particular Local History. The British who were fighting the Irish in the 1690's finally decided to sign a Treaty. The French came to Ireland to support the Irish but no sooner had the French left Ireland",

          "Historical monument where the Treaty of Limerick was signed in 1691......the Treaty Stone is situated straight across from King John's Castle.",
          "I was passing the area and visited the stone as heard so much about The Treaty years ago. it is well preserved and close to the river. well worth a visit.",
          "Unless you are a big history buff there's nothing to see. It's a monument. Best thing about it is the view of King Johns castle across the river and nice places to eat around it.",
          "We are both historians so we were interested in seeing the Treaty Stone. We were surprised to find it on a pedestal beside the River Shannon, on the street near our restaurant, The Curragower Bar, and across from King John's Castle. Take the time to read the timeline and",
          "The significance is greater than the landmark, to be sure. It's a fairly small rock that sits at the end of the boardwalk by the bridge, and we took a couple pics in passing, then read more about it online.",
          "Okay if you re in Limerick you have to visit this totally under whelming treaty stone. However, it is located in a perfect place - great view of the castle and while you are there pop into Jack Monday's for a coffee or the Curragower for a pint or lunch!",
          "I found this prominently-situated monument interesting in the historical sense, but not handsome in any sense of the word. It looks darkened and dirty, leaving the impression that it's way overdue for a thorough cleaning. The flowers display dresses up the site and helps to make",
          "It's not too much to see, but this symbol of how the royal people were dealing in this time. The view is fantastic and the history involved is very interesting.",

          "Walked past this monument in the evening and and thought 'lovely stone' but after visiting the castle in the day and the history is revealed, the monument became 'Wow'!!",
          "Not the most spectacular attraction in the city but definitely an important one to see. It's right across the river from King John's Castle so would be worth combining them when visiting the area. The walk along that side of the Shannon is also very pleasant on a sunny day.",
          "If you did not know where this stone was situated you would miss it, in our opinion it is not highlighted enough for the visitor. Once located the information surrounding the stone was interesting, however I don think more could be said to highlight the importance of this",

          "Walked past while crossing to King John's castle from a delicious lunch at the pub across the small street from this stone. Honestly - as monuments go - entirely unremarkable. Worth a read of the plaques along the base but frankly rather underwhelming.",
          "If you're passing through Limerick and you don't have much time, stop by the Treaty Stone. Not only can you read a bit about the history of the area, but it also offers great views of the River Shannon, King John's Castle, and St. Mary's Cathedral. A great place to stretch your",

          "As the title suggests, there is not much to see here. A historic rock and little else, it is not exactly good for anything other than a quick photo. You'll probably see it if you are on a tour of Limerick or visiting King Johns Castle but I wouldn't exactly go out of my way to",
          "The treaty stone sits at the corner. It is really interesting. You can actually get great photos with King John's Castle in the background. Just follow the river!",

          "This stone is where the Treaty of Limerick was signed between the Jacobite defenders of Limerick and the soldiers of William of Orange, William III King of England, II King of Scots, and William III, Stadtholder of the United Provinces of the Netherlands. Basically this was the",
          "You need to read up on the fascinating history behind the treaty stone before going to see it. It's one of the things any visitor to this interesting city must do. It's located in an historic part of Limerick...but do your research beforehand, otherwise it's a bit underwhelming",
          "I regularly pass this iconic stone when driving in Limerick. It is in a lovely location overlooking the River Shannon close to St Munchin's Church and across the river (via Thomond Bridge) from King John's Castle. It is close to the Curragower falls and at the end of a lovely",

          "The Treaty of Limerick was supposedly signed on this Treaty Stone in 1691 following the Siege of Limerick. Our guide told us that it was set up on the pedestal to keep souvenir hunters from chipping away pieces of it. The Stone lies directly across the River Shannon from the",
          "Located just opposite of King John's Castle across the River Shannon, the Treaty Stone is mega-significant history to the Irish culture.",
          "We stumbled upon this piece of history walking around the town of Limerick. They have a very interesting write up on the ground that was fun to read.",
          "A very historic monument. Situated alongside the river just outside city centre but easy to walk to. Plenty to discover around the stone about its history.",
          "Definitely worth seeing as part of exploring Limerick City, particularly if you have visited St John's Castle and understood the history of the stone. Probably not worth going out of your way for as there is no display near the treaty stone but would recommend as part of walking",
          "The Treaty stone is placed on the sidewalk on it's grand display stone with info on the stand as well as strip of bronze all around the display. There's also an information stand with some historic data about it. I expected it to be in a dedicated place like a square or a small",
          "So this is where the Irish basically lost to the British. you will see it on your walk along the Shannon. It's very sad to see.",
          "We passed by this monument during our tour in Ireland, the history behind it is quite nice and where it stands it also gives a nice view of King John's Castle",
          "We visited this as part of our walking tour with Declan Hassett - info about his tours can be obtained from King John's Castle. Good tour guide, catering for all interests.",
          "Not much to see but it's the story behind it that matters most. It's in a nice & quite spot just across the river from King John's Castle and worth a stop for a photo opportunity. Some tour buses stop here taking photos before heading over to the Castle and it became a little",
          "This is just a stone. However, it is a stone with lots of history. There is also a brief history on the ground around the stone and a plaque that says \"Treaty of Limerick signed 1691\". It is also in a nice area, across from King John's Castle and next to the Shannon River.",
          "This is one of those attractions which is difficult to rate - after all it is just a stone mounted on a plinth but the location alongside the Shannon has King John's Castle and the city of Limerick in the background giving you some great photo opportunities. There is also a",

          "The treaty stone is riddled with history and has great importance to the city of Limerick. It is in a beautiful location (on the River Shannon and across from King John's Castle). I would recommend a quick stop on the way to many of the interesting attractions in that area.",
          "Plenty of space around it for photos & its perfectly situated along the river side with King Johns castle in the background for excellent photo opportunities. The river board walk runs from the treaty stone all the way up along Clancy strand, perfect for a walk, photo's and",
          "I enjoyed stumbling across this unique piece of Irish history. While it has seen better days, it is worth looking at. There was plenty of information located around the stone, more than enough to give somebody unfamiliar with its history some baseline knowledge.",
          "At one end of Thomond Bridge and within sight of St John's castle, this memorial need not necessarily be seen for what it is, that is, a mounting stone on a plinth, but a symbol of man's perfidy and folly! I find it apt that thiis \"treaty stone\", has not a word inscribed on it",
          "Similar to Plymouth Rock, great historical import, but physically unimpressive. The view of the castle and river Shannon are worth the stop.",

      "name": "The Hunt Museum",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Hunt Museum (Irish: Iarsmalann Hunt) is a museum in the city of Limerick, Ireland. The Hunt Museum holds a personal collection donated by the Hunt family, it was originally situated in the University of Limerick, before being moved to its present location in the Georgian Custom House in 1997. The Custom House is situated on Rutland Street on the banks of the River Shannon at its confluence with the Abbey River. Among the museum's collection are works by notable artists and designers such as Pablo Picasso, Jack B. Yeats, and Sybil Connolly as well as distinctive historical items such as the O'Dea Mitre and Crozier.\n\n\n== History ==\nAs antique dealers and advisors to collectors, John and Gertrude Hunt built a thriving business and also began to acquire pieces that reflected their own interests and curiosity rather than for commercial purposes. During the latter stages of John's life, they became increasingly aware of the scale of their collection and wished that it would remain intact, so they began to search for a permanent home for it. Fortunately they met Professor Patrick Doran of the National Institute of Higher Education (now University of Limerick) and Dr Edward Walsh, the Institute's President, who agreed to house a substantial part of the collection on a temporary basis. The Hunt Museum opened there in 1978 in an exhibition room with the display designed by architect Arthur Gibney.\nDuring this period the Irish Government had declined the offer of the Hunt's collection, so the requirement to find a suitable home and owner to take responsibility for the artifacts became more urgent. The Hunt Museums Trust was established in 1974 to hold the Collection and the property at Craggaunowen (a 16th-century four-storey tower house, typical of late medieval Ireland, purchased and restored by John and Gertrude Hunt) in trust on behalf of the people of Ireland. The trust established The Hunt Museum Ltd., the sole purpose of which was the establishment of a permanent home for the museum. Under the chairmanship of Dr Tony Ryan, this company provided the necessary energy to create the museum as we see it today. A public private partnership involving the University of Limerick, Shannon Development, Limerick Corporation and the Department of Arts, Heritage, the Gaeltacht and the Islands, linked with local business interests secured the historic 18th-century former Customs House in Limerick city together with the funds to restore and renovate the building to international museum standards. The museum was officially opened by the Taoiseach John Bruton on 14 February 1997. It was a moment of great celebration for all concerned but, unfortunately, neither John nor Gertrude Hunt had lived to realise their dream. The museum stands as a monument to their enthusiasm, curiosity and generosity.\n\n\n== Custom House ==\n\nThe Custom House is regarded as the most distinguished eighteenth century building in Limerick and it is also rather unusual in comparison to other Georgian buildings in the city in that the exterior of the building is limestone rather than red brick. It is an elegant Palladian-style building designed by the Italian architect, Davis Ducart, in 1765. Both the 'Captain's Room' and 'Red Staircase' are elegant examples of Georgian architecture within the building and are testament to the optimism that the city experienced during the period of development and expansion in the late 18th century. Ducart also designed several other Palladian-style buildings in Ireland including Castletown Cox in Co. Kilkenny and Florence Court in Co. Fermanagh. The Limerick Custom House was the administrative centre for the Revenue Commissioners (including Customs and Excise) in Limerick and it was also the home of the Customs Collector in the eighteenth century. In the 1840s with the introduction of a new postal system a Penny Post Office was opened in the Custom House.\nThe Office of Public Works (OPW) undertook the major restoration and refurbishment of the building completing it in 1996. The Custom House opened as The Hunt Museum on 14 February 1997. The anniversary of the opening of The Hunt Museum is celebrated annually as 'Open Day' with free admission, talks, tours, workshops and other activities.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nThe Hunt Museum holds about 2,500 different artifacts, both from Ireland and abroad. The oldest pieces are from Stone-Age Ireland and ancient Egypt. The collection includes the Antrim Cross (an early 9th-century cast bronze and enamel cross), dresses by Irish designer Sybil Connolly, drawings by Picasso and a bronze horse once thought to be a design by Leonardo da Vinci for a large monument. The bronze horse is similar to the Budapest horse, but its provenance was disproven in 2009. Some of the Hunt collection is also on display at the nearby Craggaunowen in County Clare, which was also greatly contributed to by John and Gertrude Hunt.\n\n\n=== Religious Artifacts ===\nJohn Hunt was extremely interested in early Christian art and artifacts and he collected them widely, so the museum collection held many religious items from rosary beads to statues of varying sizes, from not just Ireland but from around Europe. The Museums 'Treasury Room' houses a great number of these items and among the artifacts in this room are the beautiful Arthur Cross and Arthur Chalice.  Also found in the collection were significant medieval Christian pieces such as the Antrim Cross, the Cashel Bell, and the Hohenzollern Crucifix.\n\n\n=== Sybil Connolly ===\n\nThe Sybil Connolly collection at The Hunt Museum is formed by different documents, sketches, letters, photographs, ceramic and textile items. The textile collection is made up for 45 pieces designed by Sybil Connolly during her career. The collection holds iconic dresses like \"Heiress Dress\u201d or \u201cPink Ice Dress\u201d. Gertrude Hunt kindly donated most of the Sybil Connolly collection to the museum.\n\n\n=== Temporary Exhibition Gallery ===\nIncluded in the plan to house the Hunt collection in the custom house was also an idea for a purpose built modern gallery space. It was completed as a part of the renovation of the Custom House and is regularly used for temporary exhibitions that accompany the permanent collection.\n\n\n=== Horse Outside ===\n\nIn 2011 a lifesize model of a horse, painted by  young people aged 10\u201318 was placed outside the front of the building.  This was joined by a second one in 2012.  The models are made of fibreglass, and are taken inside at night. The art installation was inspired by the song Horse Outside by the group The Rubberbandits.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nIn December 2003, the Simon Wiesenthal Center alleged in a letter to President Mary McAleese that the museum's collection contained items looted by the Nazis during the Second World War, although the letter did not refer to any specific items in the collection. The museum denied the claims.An inquiry led by former Supreme Court judge Donal Barrington was set up by the museum, but its members resigned in February 2005, saying that the museum's funding made an independent inquiry impossible, and requesting that a more appropriate inquiry be created. The Department of Arts then provided \u20ac150,000 in funding for a second inquiry led by former civil servant Se\u00e1n Cromien, under the auspices of the Royal Irish Academy (RIA). The second inquiry was due to submit an interim report to the Royal Irish Academy in November 2005 and did so in February 2006. Meantime, in October 2005, the museum published a catalogue of its exhibits on the internet, providing full details of all the items in its collection. In June 2006, the inquiry submitted the final report, which was published on the RIA's website.\nAlso in June 2006, a one-day conference took place on the theme of Contested Cultural Property and Museums: The Case of the Hunt Museum. At this conference, a message was conveyed from Shimon Samuels, who had sent the original letter to Mary McAleese, questioning why he had not been invited to the seminar. Later, the terms of reference of the Hunt Museum Evaluation Group were questioned, the Simon Wiesenthal Center believing that more emphasis should have been placed on investigating the purported Nazi links of the Hunt family and the Hunt Museum Evaluation Group believing that this lay beyond their terms of reference, which were to do with provenance research. The Royal Irish Academy issued a press release responding to the statement of the Simon Wiesenthal Center.\n\nResolutionA 2007 report from American expert Lynn Nicholas, published by the Royal Irish Academy following three years of investigation, called the Wiesenthal Center's allegations \"unprofessional in the extreme.\"\nNicholas found that the Wiesenthal Center had misidentified names in the letters.\n\"The name used, four times in one letter, is Buhl, not Buhrle, and the individual described, an unreliable dealer who sells forgeries, certainly bears no resemblance to the extremely rich collector and armaments manufacturer Emil Buhrle,\" the report said.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLimerick City Gallery of Art\nLimerick City Museum\nList of museums in the Republic of Ireland\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Hunt Museum at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial website\nHunt Museum Evaluation Group final report  \u2014 June, 2006",

          "Happened upon this spot while walking towards King John's Castle. Was drawn in by the 2 horse statues in the courtyard and the enticing gift shop. Took in the collection as well as the Yeats/Henry exhibition. Even though I'm not a museum type, it was interesting. The staff",
          "The museum has quite an eclectic collection and there is much to learn. Take advantage of the knowledge of the attending docents, makes the visit that much fuller. Although the displays could use a face lift and be better lit, the stories they hold make the visit worthwhile.",
          "This museum display\u2019s a great collection by a private collector who has given it to the community. The collection shows the range of interested the Hunt family had and offers an insight into a range of era including ancient Ireland. I was aware Ireland had an interesting",
          "Finished an excellent walking tour here. Delighted to learn that it was free on Sundays too. A variety of stuff on offer, well presented.",
          "It's a good place to stop for lunch, as well as a small museum. Unfortunately there had been flooding when we were there and it looked as if there was structural damage in the restaurant. Hope it can be repaired.",
          "Hunt Museum is easy to access. Reasonable parking in the Potato Market less than 100m on the left straight past the Museum. Staff very friendly. Well laid out. Shop good. Very welcoming. Worth a visit. Ideal for visitors or locals alike.",
          "Would highly recommend doing the daily tour for this exhibition as their works of art were so well explained and compared. It was also very interesting to visit the three floors of original artefacts gathered by Mr & Mrs Hunt. There is also a coffee shop here.",
          "My Mother and I visited Limerick due to our Ancestors originating from there, and we had been recommended the Hunt Museum whilst in Tipperary. Once we'd parked in Limerick, we stopped to ask directions, and a lady also recommend the museum. It was a pleasure to visit, right from",

          "Not a large museum but a superb collection of artifacts donated by a private collector (Mr Hunt). One item of interest was one of the \"30 Pieces of Silver\". There was also an ivory carving of the Birth of Jesus; a Bronze Age shield some 2,500 years old. Beautiful Roman items.",
          "I went here with my 8 year old daughter and we really liked it, especially if you are into history and artifacts. We went on a Saturday and it was \u20ac5 for me and \u20ac2.50 for my daughter, now I had no problem with the price, but it is free on Sundays which would save on the cost.",
          "Had a great time. Must see if coming to Limerick. Collections were stunning. Gave me a real sense of history which we don\u2019t have a lot of in Australia :-)",

          "The museum was smaller than expected, but they do have some nice collections. I like how they have many things in cabinets that you can open up to view more. They have a nice tea room on site which had a delicious apple tart.",
          "Interesting exhibits and artefacts. Loved the painted horses outside. Well stocked shop with unusual gifts and souvenirs.",
          "The museum itself is good, but find out about what's currently on exhibition. We saw a Yeats/Henry display contrasting their perspectives on Ireland that was made excellent by adding the guided tour. There was also free lunchtime music the day we visited (check their website). I",
          "Excellent museum with a huge and impressive collection of artefacts from all over the world. Make sure to visit the Paul Henry & Jack B. Yeats exhibition also, on display until September. Truly inspirational!",

          "Late opening hours are good over July...some more signage at the items would be good. Spent about an hour there",
          "Visited this museum today on a trip to Limerick. It has been on a wish list for a long time and I was not disappointed. It's a very eclectic collection that stretches from Stone Age artefacts (very high quality flints and axes to name but a few) to the work of modern Irish",

          "We had wonderful day at The Hunt Museum. We started off with a lovely lunch and a browse through the gift shop. We followed this up by a wonderful tour of the collection. The artwork was amazing and thought provoking. All the staff were friendly and helpful, especially Oliver",
          "thought it would be interesting to visit but I thought It was a compleate waste of money, took less than 20mins to see everything. it was 2 for 1 deal but we had to pay full fare on 2 tickets to see temporary exhibition which we werent made aware of when when paying.",
          "Visited here because it's important to know the local area as well far away places! The Paul Henry - Jack B. Yates exhibition is well worth a visit while it's still here. I'm a Paul Henry convert! Cheap admission to the gallery and free entry to the general museum on Sunday's. A",
          "Toured the ground, first, and second floors. These included religious art, the development of the decorative arts from the Medieval Period to the Age of Enlightenment, and the archaeological collections. These are the personal collections of John and Gertrude Hunt who donated",
          "Very friendly staff Highly interesting museum Cafe ideal for family needs Highly recommend for a family day out",

          "We read reviews on line and were not sure if we should go given our limited time as it was our last full day of vacation. We decided to go and are so glad we did. The visual displays are large, well designed, well lit and very interesting. The collection was surprisingly",
          "Always an incredible experience- a must see if you are visiting Limerick! I bought a beautiful scarf from my grandmother in the cute little shop after a lovely coffee in the Hunt Cafe before embarking on the amazing Jack B Yeats exhibition.",
          "Visited here during my time in Limerick and was impressed by this quiet gem of a museum! You could tell that they were proud of their collection and it is displayed in a way which shows this. Obviously well looked after and maintained, definitely worth a visit if you find",

          "The Hunts had exquisite taste. That combined with a lifelong opportunity to collect resulted in this collection of very fine artifacts representative of many periods of civilization. While the emphasis is on the medieval, fine pieces from the paleolithic to our times are on",
          "A great small museum with pieces from a private collection spanning the world and eras. The building is old and interesting in itself. I would recommend a visit.",
          "The Hunt museum staff were excellent. However, the museum itself felt somewhat aimless. There are many varied objects on display, but most of them are only remarkable by being old. There is no narrative to the museum, and it really is just the collection of a wealthy family",
          "The Hunt Museum is a must visit if in the Mid West of Ireland. A private collection of medieval artefacts, collected over a life time and given to the people of Limerick by the Hunt family.",
          "Close to the heart of limerick city, the cafe provides a varied menu for lunch in comfortable surroundings. Short walk away to river amenities",
          "This is such an interesting museum. A great mix of items, good signing and some real gems. We wandered round on our own for about an hour and were just about to leave when we met...Mike Rowcroft. How lucky were we. A volunteer (I think) guide at the museum, he showed us many",
          "My negativity is based on the arrangement of \"newly created student objects\" in with the antiques. The scattered skulls created by students of art were placed in a rather odd \"one here, one there\" showing.",
          "We went with our 13 yr old daughter and she enjoyed it greatly. The food in the cafe was good and the shop is \u263a.",
          "Firstly we had an amazing guide - Gillian. She was so informative and made the visit so interesting. The artefacts are incredible and so numerous. What incredible people the Hunt family were. Loved every minute of the tour. Thank you Gillian",
          "As might be expected from a museum established to house a private collection, the quality of the pieces varied considerably. John B. Hunt had been an amateur archeologist; and true to his interest in antiquities, the museum was long on Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Age, and",
          "The Hunt Museum in Limerick city is a little gem. An eclectic mix of rarities from way back to the nineteenth century. Well displayed with good video interaction. Tasty little restaurant attached with nice fresh foods and confectionery. Not the usual stodgy foods, good quality",
          "it was grand a bit trying to be posh or something a bit up themselves its always the same and its just ok there a bit sour",
          "Features wonderful collections from time to time, would highly recommend for visitors to Limerick, downstairs gallery is free.",
          "I love a good museum and although the Hunt Museum did not disappoint, I didn't leave knowing more than I did going in. I can see that the local students benefit greatly from the items on display.",
          "We enjoyed our visit and was drawn to the Hunt as they have an original Renoir, but there is so much more to see. Asked for help locating Renoir and a docent was kind to lead the was and was very cordial and informative. He told us the Hunts liked people to be curious so I won't",
          "Supreme museum! A gorgeous gem in Limerick city! Plenty to see, take your time and do not rush. Besides the art and the artifacts, the building itself is a work of art and historic importance.",
          "Wonderful personal collection of varied artefacts bequeathed by a remarkable family. Don't forget to visit the tea room which is great value and has scrumptious cakes, as well as the exhibitions in the basement",

          "My wife and I came to see the museum as it was a very wet day and not fit for much else We got a guided tour of all the fascinating things to see but for me the most beautiful was on of the 30 pieces of silver that Judus got for betraying Jesus.",
          "This museum is set in a period building, formerly a Custom House, and is one of Limerick's hidden gems. It has a great collection of art and antiquities. One for the family as well as the individual. Central, has it's own coffee shop and gift shop and is a delight to visit. Free",
          "the hunt museum is another of my favourites and its free to visit on sundays so if you find your self with nothing to do on a sunday then head to the hunt museum",
          "Great collection and tour with our free museum docent made the visit excellent and tied the collection into the Irish history.",
          "Well worth a visit and not just on Culture night....if you love history then you will love The Hunt Museum",

          "Such a beautiful building with gorgeous artwork. Friendly and welcoming staff with a height of knowledge of all the artwork",
          "This little museum is awesome. They have a very nice collection of local art. Not to be missed if you visit Limerick.",
          "Do you know that one of the 30 pieces of silver Judas was paid id reputed to be among the collection. Also some very fine paintings of local areas from times past. I particularly like the the painting of the Kilmallock countryside. One piece that would do well to be returned to",
          "Glad I went on a Sunday because it was free entrance. The only really amazing thing to me was pulling out a drawer and seeing sketches by famous artists inches away from me.",
          "Lots to see and well worth a visit. Lots of artifacts from limerick . Visitors shop has nice bits to buy . However the cafe is disappointing. The food I'd good and tasty bit it looks unfinished.i just feel they could make it a lot better than loose chairs scattered and untidy",
          "The Donald Teskey exhibition \"Weather Guage\" running until Feb 2017 is really worth a visit. It takes you to the west coast of Ireland in a dramatic fashion. Follow this with a great lunch at the Hunt museum cafe and you are laughing!",
          "A lovely coffee shop with delicious goodies and savouries. Great staff and efficient service. Well worth the visit - even if you are not visiting the museum - go there anyway, and enjoy looking out at the Shannon flowing by.",
          "Love the peacefulness of the museum and the interesting things on display. Nice but pricey gift shop. The coffee shop has homemade soup and homemade scones (among other things). Great coffee shop.",
          "This is a beautiful museum, not a far walk from King John's Castle. The Hunt exhibits one of Ireland's greatest private collections of art and antiquities dating from the Neolithic period to the 20th century. It's open from 10-5 daily but pay attention to closing around the",
          "Incredible works by artists dating back millennia and incorporating artists ranging from old masters, to the greats of Ireland and many inbetween!",
          "To be honest I'm more of a art gallery type of person, but I decided to pay a visit at the Hunt museum and I was delighted! It's fun and interesting, and the feature that you're able to open the drawers to explore things adds to the experience! I can absolutely see how even kids",
          "We spent one and a half hours here. It was an enjoyable visit - interesting to open the drawers and view the contents. We also visited the cafe and the food was good. Lovely shop but too expensive for our income and I would think many of the visitors.",
          "I have always wanted to visit the The Hunt Collection and I was not disappointed - the whole display, laid out over 3 floors was wonderful. The wishes of the Hunt family were adhered to, in that as much as possible of the Collection was displayed. We were offered a guided tour",
          "Found this museum somewhat disappointing. There are a lot of religious artefacts and little else of interest I'm afraid",
          "We were met by a gentleman that kindly walked us around the museum and pointed out some of the extraordinary items on display that the Hunt family collected on their lifetime.",

          "Myself and my mother stopped in the Hunt Museum restaurant for a cuppa last weekend. We ordered tea for 2 and two Banofee pies. The pie was delicious! There was only one teabag in the teapot for 2 people so we had to ask for another but the girl was very obliging and gave us",

          "This is not a big or spectacular one, you have to go with someone who knows their stuff. If not, ask at souvenir shop (a well-stocked one!) (all things Irish design!) and they will be glad to help. The most fun were the drawers!!! Try it. And find the Picasso!!! Hint: it's a",

          "Lovely museum, filled with interested artifacts dating from Roman times to present. The exhibits are located on three floors. Plan to spend a couple of hours. We ate a very reasonably priced and good lunch in the museum restaurant. The gift had some interesting items, well",

          "A real treasure trove of Art, History, Antiques and Archaeology from all over the world in the heart of Limerick, was hugely impressed by this collection. This visit was topped off by the 'Docent' Shae who gave us a marvelous tour and a great feel for all of the antiquities.",

          "This was an interesting collection, and we enjoyed it. But, we were a little put out to find out later that we were not giving discounts that were available. We were there on Monday, Oct. 3 and apparently Monday is 2 for 1 admission according to a few tourist guide books.",
          "Visit to the museum since the weather outside was windy, and it was really nice. You only need about and hour to see the exhibits but they are presented well. The Cafe is marvelous with a good selection of sweets and salads and more. Really cozy atmosphere and plenty of tables",

          "Had great expectations of learning more about Irish history, but it is more a display of the private collection of the Hunt family. Most of the pieces are from Germany, France, Italy, and England which you can see anywhere - quite disappointing.",

          "Don't normally do museums (including theLouvre) but we had some time after going through the Castle so did this museum on the way back and so glad we did. No queueing, no pressure and just wandering through the museum was great",
          "The Hunt is an absolute gem of a museum. The range of artifacts is so great that there is bound to be something to interest everyone. The building itself is a must see if visiting limerick! Very helpful staff and volunteers and they do a great deal to improve the cultural fabric",

          "The Hunt museum houses many treasures from ancient Ireland to incredible religious relics and object. It is uniqu because many of the treasures are in drawers you pull out to view and it does not have the usual museum ambiance. It is rather like a large house with many room. Two",

          "I enjoyed my visit to the Hunt Museum. While their normal exhibits are interesting and cover a wide area of material they also hold free exhibitions in the basement which are well worth a visit. A paid visit to the Hunt is well worth doing on a wet day in Limerick. Checking",

          "This is a small museum and pretty eclectic, which means there is a fair breadth of exhibits, but not much depth. In my opinion, there are too few items of genuine interest. I've seen too many axe heads, too many old needles and too many unidentifiable agricultural thingies, so",
          "They serve fairly traditional food here - fabulous deserts. Don't have the coffee. After lunch you can take a look around the museum too.",

          "Met my tour guide (see my review of Limerick Walking Tours) at the Hunt and I spent about 3 hours total there, both pre and post tour. Art exhibit on bottom floor celebrating the events of 1916 was inspiring and educational. The regular museum displays were very good and I",
          "Nice collection of artifacts from different times. There is a Picasso and Rembrandt. It wasn't crowded at all and I thought it worth the price. There is a restaurant that appears to have live music. I didn't eat there but it looked pleasant.",
          "We spent about an hour visiting. While there were some exhibits that were worthwhile, overall, I would not recommend it for people with a limited amount of time.",

          "Really enjoyed this museum! Very reasonably priced, great collections of anything and everything. Beautiful artwork, pottery, artifacts, religious statues, jewelry etc. Loved it! Picasso and a Renoir in there too which is fab. Took about 2 hours to see everything as theres so",

          "The Hunt Museum isn't large, but had an exquisite collection of really fine pieces. They range from the Mesolithic to the present and include some real gems, like Charles I seal made from an emerald. If the more mundane interests you, the caf\u00e9 has some lovely food.",
          "The hunts collected a bit of every of antiquirey they could find, with no real pattern. Some pieces are interesting, but the overall effect is somewhat discombobulated.",
          "Saw many interesting collections here. Some of the displays could use a more complete description but overall a very well spent afternoon.",
          "For 5 euros you can see a vast collection of ancient items from the passionate Hunts, art dealers and archeological participants. I think it's important to support efforts to know the history of humans through their personal effects. It's how we know how we got to here. It's",
          "There are those of us who love museums, pottery, artefacts and those who can take it or leave it. I can immerse myself in history and appreciate how an individual has collected and given to their chosen city or establishment their life work. Well worth a visit for that alone,",

          "Located near the river, with ample parking garages nearby, this small museum is well worth a stop to view what had been a mostly private, family-held (the Hunts) collection, that reflects Irish culture and heritage since early in the island's inhabited history. On different",

          "Happened to be free for us when we visited on Sunday but worth the admission price. Great museum with 3 floors of a great collection that was given to the people of Ireland by Hunt. Nice gift shop and cafe also.",
          "From our perspective the museum was lacking in Irish history. The displays on show did not make us stop for long.",
          "We went here when we found ourselves free when in Lim for a family wedding - this was a super-interesting museum. The exhibits were really well laid out, the information was great - with nice overviews, but more depth for those who want it too. So much to take in - it would take",
          "Nice small museum. A couple of the items we especially wanted to see were not on display, but there were surprises. The gentleman at reception was very friendly and helpful. There are two colorful horses on display in front of the museum. It is a good place to spend an hour.",
          "Interesting museum with a lot of different items from different time. Variety of medieval items. Easy to visit.",

          "We had seen the high ratings and enthusiastic recommendations so when we found ourselves outside the Hunt we went in. Its an interesting place, and the Hunts certainly must have been energetic collectors. I found a number of items that I was happy to have the opportunity to see,",
          "Well, I love visiting Museums, so it was the best place for me in Limerick. It was very nice to see how the museum staffs were dedicated to maintain things in it. Very nice collection and quite a large one as well. The shop inside has very beautiful collection. I loved shopping",

          "Stopped in on the fly and decided to have a guide for the collection. In the short time we were there I learned more about Irish history, culture, and art than I could have in a month of books. Incredibly friendly staff and an amazing collection worth spending an afternoon on.",
          "First of all, it is not a museum about hunting, Hunt is surname of family who owns the collection (wrong translated to Turkish) If you are in Limerick as a tourist, this is one of place that worth to visit. We learned it is free on Sundays but for a couple they charge 5 Euro on",
          "My sister and I spent a couple of days exploring Limerick and the Hunt Museum was well worth a visit. The museum is fascinating and made even more so by docents who manage to be both engagingly informative while not smothering you. Kudos! The collection is amazingly diverse.",

          "We went there hoping to see a traveling exhibit of prison art, but it had closed the day before. The manager actually walked us downstairs to see if we could get a glimpse of some of the art that hadn't been bubble-wrapped and put away. I thought that was really really nice.",
          "This outstanding museum is like visiting wonderland- you have to open drawers in order to see the exhibits! History walks here side by side with contemporary art and design, as the museum, which is more like a well organized curiosity shop, features exhibits from ancient times",

          "A museum with lots of different things to look at from pottery to stone axe heads to paintings - something for everyone.",
          "Really lovely museum with an amazing breadth and wealth of exhibits. Almost boutique in style and just enough to interest the kids and satisfy us adults without exhausting us all. I really enjoyed a temporary exhibition of work produced in prison art workshops.",
          "Our visit to the museum was a most pleasant experience. Excellent value. The exhibits were most interesting, enhanced by museum's guide. Within walking distance from city centre.",
          "Interesting displays at a location that is very convenient in an area full of attractions. We were there on the one \u201cIreland Culture Night\u201d of the year, which resulted in a large crowd. We could not find everything we wanted to see due to crowd. I believe that under normal",
          "This museum which is based in the old custom house isn't huge but has a very interesting collection of artefacts which were originally collected by Mr and Mrs Hunt. There was a display on while we were there of a competition/exhibition with various categories of clothes/",

          "If you like museums with small and important collections you will love this museum. Apparently it has been recently renovated and the collections are quite nice in the setting. Artifacts from the Iron Age to a Picasso and two Rembrants the museum is small but wonderful. Take",
          "We decided to go to the Hunt museum on a whim as we were walking by it. It was a waste of 10 euro. The lobby/gift shop smelled horrible and the museum itself was dull. Half the items in there were not even artifacts, but random art for sale. The only upside I guess was seeing",
          "I visited the Hunt earlier this week for a free lecture and while there I took a walk around the collection. There is certainly a great variety in the exhibits. Pottery, ceramics, clothing and even paintings. They've also caught up with technology by installing QR codes on some",
          "We visited this museum on our last day in Limerick. We were lucky enough to be able to take advantage of the \"BOGOF\" - (2 for the price of one) and being pensioners we thought that was brilliant!! Our guide - Jackie Shannon was very interesting to listen to and was clearly",
          "The Hunt Museum contains a very eclectic selection of art and historical objects sufficient to satisfy any museum goer. As a plus, it's very small with only 3 floors which makes it ideal for a short visit. You can see it all in about two hours. Great gift shop as well selling",

          "Very interesting artefacts, original pieces and replicas of chalices, pottery etc. Easy to find your way around this museum. The only disappointing thing for me was that the famous gold cross given by Mary Queen of Scott's to her executioner was not to be seen. It is on show in",
          "The painted horses outside were the attraction for our 7 year old visitor. I had wanted to visit for quite a while; I didn't expect Anna to enjoy it quite so much. She got a clipboard and a list of questions to answer and things to find-instant success. The adults found the",
          "The hunt museum is truly a hidden gem in Limerick city. It has a beautiful gift shop as you enter with a wide range of price tags. The collections in the museum itself are both historicsl and contrmporary. Alongside all of this is a very attractive, reasonably priced",

          "We went in as we passed not expecting much and found a wonderful collection of art. While we were there a special exhibit of local artist was particularly moving. This is well worth the 5 Euro admission",
          "I asked a guide there something and she was kind enough to give me a full tour of the museum. Being an antiques appraiser I was interested in alot of the pieces. She was very informed and personable. I felt like I had booked a private tour!",
          "interesting. we finished very quickly. everything is shown nicely nice day out.can get a bit boring at times",

          "The Hunt museum is a cute little Limerick gem. Interesting museum, really enjoyed our tour with one of the docent's in the museum. Absolutely suggest doing the tour with a guide-learned so much more this way. Interesting pieces we would have normally missed without a guide. Open",

        "wiki": "Limerick (; Irish: Luimneach [\u02c8l\u032a\u02e0\u026am\u02b2(\u0259)n\u02b2\u0259x]) is a city in County Limerick, Ireland. It is located in the Mid-West Region and is also part of the province of Munster. With a population of 94,192 at the 2016 census, Limerick is the third-most populous urban area in the state, and the fourth-most populous city on the island of Ireland. The city lies on the River Shannon, with the historic core of the city located on King's Island, which is bounded by the Shannon and Abbey Rivers. Limerick is also located at the head of the Shannon Estuary, where the river widens before it flows into the Atlantic Ocean. Limerick City and County Council is the local authority for the city.\n\n\n== Geography and political subdivisions ==\nAt the 2016 census, the Metropolitan District of Limerick had a population of 104,952. On 1 June 2014 following the merger of Limerick City and County Council, a new Metropolitan District of Limerick was formed within the united council, which extended the city area. The Metropolitan District includes the city urban area and extends outwards towards Patrickswell in the west and Castleconnell in the east. The City Metropolitan Area however excludes city suburbs located within County Clare.\nLimerick is one of the constituent cities of the Cork\u2013Limerick\u2013Galway corridor, which has a population of 1 million people. It is located at a strategic position on the River Shannon with four main crossing points near the city centre. To the south of the city is the Golden Vale, an area of rich pastureland. Historically, much of the city's industry was based on this rich agricultural hinterland, and it is particularly noted for Limerick ham.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient and medieval history ===\nLuimneach originally referred to the general area along the banks of the Shannon Estuary known as Loch Luimnigh. The earliest settlement in the city, Inis Sibhtonn, was the original name for King's Island during the pre-Viking and Viking eras. This island was also called Inis an Ghaill Duibh, 'The Dark-(haired) Foreigner's Island'. The name is recorded in Viking sources as Hlymrekr.\nThe city dates from 812; however, history suggests the presence of earlier settlements in the area surrounding King's Island, the island at the historical city centre. Antiquity's map-maker, Ptolemy, produced in 150 the earliest map of Ireland, showing a place called Regia at the same site as King's Island. History also records an important battle involving Cormac mac Airt in 221 and a visit by Saint Patrick in 434 to baptise an E\u00f3ganachta king, Carthann the Fair. Saint Munchin, the first bishop of Limerick died in 652, indicating the city was a place of some note. In 812 the Vikings sailed up the Shannon and pillaged the city, burned the monastery of Mungret but were forced to flee when the Irish attacked and killed many of their number. The Normans redesigned the city in the 12th century and added much of the most notable architecture, such as King John's Castle and St Mary's Cathedral.In early medieval times Limerick was at the centre of the Kingdom of Thomond which corresponds to the present day County Clare, the Kingdom also included North Kerry and parts of South Offaly. One of the kingdom's most notable kings was Brian Boru, ancestor of the O'Brien Clan of Dalcassians. The word Thomond is synonymous with the region and is retained in place names such as Thomondgate, Thomond Bridge and Thomond Park.\n\n\n=== Late Renaissance/Early modern history ===\n\nLimerick in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was often called the most beautiful city in Ireland. The English-born judge Luke Gernon, a resident of Limerick, wrote in 1620 that at his first sight of the city he had been amazed at its magnificence: \"lofty buildings of marble, like the Colleges in Oxford\".During the civil wars of the 17th century the city played a pivotal role, besieged by Oliver Cromwell in 1651 and twice by the Williamites in the 1690s. The Treaty of Limerick ended the Williamite war in Ireland which was fought between supporters of the Catholic King James II (Jacobites) and the Protestant King William of Orange (Williamites). The treaty offered toleration to Catholicism and full legal rights to Catholics that swore an oath of loyalty to William III and Mary II. The Treaty was of national significance as it ensured closer British and Protestant dominance over Ireland. The articles of the Treaty protecting Catholic rights were not passed by the Protestant Irish Parliament which rather updated the Penal Laws against Catholics which had major implications for Irish history. Reputedly the Treaty was signed on the Treaty Stone, an irregular block of limestone which once served as a mounting block for horses. This stone is now displayed on a pedestal at Clancy Strand. Because of the treaty, Limerick is sometimes known as the Treaty City. This turbulent period earned the city its motto: urbs antiqua fuit studisque asperrima belli (an ancient city well studied in the arts of war).\nThe peaceful times that followed the turmoil of the late 17th century allowed the city to prosper through trade in the late 18th century. During this time Limerick Port established itself as one of Ireland's major commercial ports exporting agricultural produce from one of Ireland's most fertile areas, the Golden Vale, to Britain and America. This increase in trade and wealth, particularly amongst the city's merchant classes saw a rapid expansion of the city as Georgian Limerick began to take shape. This gave the city its present-day look including the extensive terraced streets of Georgian townhouses which remain in the city centre today. The Waterford and Limerick Railway linked the city to the Dublin\u2013Cork railway line in 1848 and to Waterford in 1853. The opening of a number of secondary railways in the subsequent decades developed Limerick as a regional centre of communications.  However, the economic downturn in the European conflicts of the French Revolution and Napoleonic eras, and following the Act of Union 1800, and the impact of the Great Irish Famine of 1848 caused much of the 19th century to be a more troubled period.\n\n\n=== 20th-century history ===\n\nThe Limerick boycott was an economic boycott waged against the small Jewish community for over two years in the first decade of the 20th century. It was accompanied by a number of assaults, stone throwing and intimidation, which caused many Jews to leave the city. It was instigated in 1904 by a Redemptorist priest, Father John Creagh.\nDuring the Irish War of Independence, the Limerick Soviet was a self-declared soviet that existed from 15 to 27 April 1919. A general strike was organised by the Limerick Trades and Labour Council, as a protest against the British Army's declaration of a \"Special Military Area\" under the Defence of the Realm Act, which covered most of Limerick city and a part of the county. During the strike a special strike committee was set up to print their own money, control food prices and publish newspapers.\nBy the mid-20th century, Limerick was characterised by economic stagnation and decline as many traditional industries closed or left the city. However, there were some success stories. In 1942 Shannon Airport (located in County Clare, 20 km west of the city) opened for the first time offering transatlantic flights. In 1959, Shannon Airport enabled the opening of the Shannon Free Zone which attracted a large number of multinational companies to the region. A long campaign for a third level educational institute to be located in the city finally bore fruit with the establishment of NIHE Limerick in 1969 which eventually became the University of Limerick in 1989.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nThe local government area of Limerick city is under the jurisdiction of Limerick City and County Council. The Council has responsibility for local services such as sanitation, planning and development, libraries, collection of motor taxation, local roads and social housing in the city. The council comprises elected ward Councillors with an appointed full-time CEO as the city (and county) manager. Local elections are held every five years and the Councillors annually elect a Cathaoirleach or chairman to chair the council. As of 2015, the Cathaoirleach was Cllr Liam Galvin from the Newcastle West electoral area. The 21 Councillors from the 3 electoral districts in the City Metropolitan Area also elect a mayor to represent the city. The Mayoral position is largely ceremonial and has much reduced responsibility following the merger of the Limerick local authorities. Although the Mayor is the city's first citizen, within the council the position is below that of the Cathaoirleach. The current mayor is Councillor Jerry O'Dea. Former well-known mayors include TDs Donogh O'Malley, Stephen Coughlan, Michael Lipper, Jim Kemmy and Jan O'Sullivan.Throughout most of the city's history; from 1197 when it gained its first charter, Limerick City had its own local government authority, Limerick Corporation later known as Limerick City Council. The council was one of the oldest in Ireland and was only exceeded in age by Dublin City Council. In October 2012 the Government of Ireland published Putting People First- Action Programme for Effective Local Government which set out Government policy for reforms across all the main areas of local government in Ireland. Among the recommendations was the merging of Limerick City Council with Limerick County Council. The changes came into effect on 1 June 2014 following the implementation of the Local Government Reform Act 2014.By the 1960s onwards the city had outgrown its boundary considerably; the city boundary was only altered slightly and never reflected the overall urban area of the city. A limited boundary extension on the city's north side in 2008 enlarged the city boundary by 1,020 hectares increasing the city's area by almost 50% and raising the population by an estimated 7,000. The previous boundary, encompassing 2,086 hectares, was delineated in 1950. Newer suburban districts such as Dooradoyle, Castletroy \u2013 including the University, Gouldavoher, and Raheen were continually administered to by Limerick County Council until the merger of the two authorities in June 2014. This local government structure in Limerick caused a number of inefficiencies, most notably in the area of planning. A number of suburbs such as Westbury and Parteen to the north of the city are governed by Clare County Council.\nFollowing the merger of the two authorities in 2014 a new Metropolitan District of Limerick City was set up that included the city urban area and also settlements close to the city such as Patrickswell and Castleconnell. The Metropolitan district returns 21 Councillors to Limerick City and County Council which in total has 40 Councillors returned from across Limerick City and County. The Limerick City Metropolitan District is divided into 3 wards or electoral areas which are; Limerick City East, Limerick City North and Limerick City South which elect eight, six and seven Councillors respectively.Following the 2019 local elections, Fine Gael was the largest party on the united authority with 13 seats followed by Fianna F\u00e1il with 12, Labour with 3, Sinn F\u00e9in and the Green Party (Ireland) with 2 each, the Social Democrats with 1 seat, and Independents and other parties the remaining 6 seats.For national D\u00e1il elections Limerick City is in the Limerick City constituency. From 2011, the constituency boundaries changed in accordance with the proposals of the Constituency Commission and the subsequent Electoral (Amendment) Act 2009. This changed the electoral boundaries from Limerick East and Limerick West to Limerick City and Limerick. Limerick city encompasses the city, the suburban areas of Castletroy and as far east as Castleconnell. It also includes part of south County Clare. The Limerick county constituency takes in most of the rest of the county. For European parliament elections Limerick is in South Ireland.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nLimerick's climate is classified as temperate oceanic (K\u00f6ppen Cfb). Met \u00c9ireann maintains a climatological weather station at Shannon Airport, 20 kilometres west of the city in County Clare. Shannon Airport records an average of 977 millimetres of precipitation annually, most of which is rain. Limerick has a mild climate, with the average daily maximum in July of 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) and the average daily minimum in January of 3 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F). The highest temperature recorded was 32.0 \u00b0C (89.6 \u00b0F) in June 2018, and the lowest \u221211.4 \u00b0C (11.5 \u00b0F) in 2010. Limerick is the cloudiest city in the state, averaging only 1,295 sunshine hours annually, 3.5 hours of sunshine every day. There are on average 62 days of no recordable sunshine, 6 days of thunder, 22 days of hail and 11 days of snow per year. Shannon Airport is located by the ocean at an elevation of 14 metres, so snow is less common at the station than in the city itself.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn 2014, Limerick became Ireland's inaugural National City of Culture, with a variety of artistic and cultural events occurring at locations around the city throughout the year.\nThe Limerick City Gallery of Art on Pery Square is the city's chief venue for contemporary art exhibitions. It is home to a permanent collection of Irish art, which shows works from the early 18th to 20th century. The gallery houses the National Collection of Contemporary Drawing founded by the artist Samuel Walsh in 1987. Limerick's major contemporary art event is EVA International, Ireland's Biennial of Contemporary Art. EVA International, centered mainly in the Limerick City Gallery of Art, is curated by varying guest curators and includes contemporary artworks by both international and Irish artists.The Lime Tree Theatre officially opened at the Mary Immaculate College campus in October 2012. The venue hosts theatre, music, comedy, traditional arts, schools' performances and conferences.The Belltable Arts Centre on O'Connell Street hosts local playwrights and drama productions. The University Concert Hall located in UL is a 1,000 seat venue and provides a large venue for national and international acts to visit the city. Limerick is also the home of street theatre companies, including \"The Umbrella Project\".\nLimerick's literature scene is supported by projects like the Limerick Writers' Centre, which was established in 2008 and runs a range of writing activities in the city. Limerick natives include Pulitzer Prize winning author, Frank McCourt; novelists Kate O'Brien, Michael Curtin, Kevin Barry and Donal Ryan. Poets from Limerick include Michael Hogan, Desmond O'Grady, and John Liddy.Other Limerick arts groups include Contact Studios, which provides individual studio spaces for visual artists; the Daghdha Dance Company, a contemporary dance company that has adopted a renovated church in John's Square, adjacent to St John's Cathedral, as a performance space); the Fresh Film Festival, which is held each spring, and includes films made by young people (7\u201318 years); Impact Theatre Company; and Limerick Printmakers Studio and Gallery, which provides printmaking facilities, a venue for exhibitions and events and an education programme. The Limerick Youth Theatre provides young people with an opening into acting and production.The Irish Chamber Orchestra and the Irish World Music Centre are both based in the University of Limerick. The university has a thousand-seat state-of-the-art concert hall that hosts visiting performers. The city's music scene has produced bands such as The Cranberries, guitarist Noel Hogan's MonoBand, The Hitchers and others. Electronic musician Richard D. James, more commonly known as Aphex Twin, was born in Limerick in 1971. The Limerick Art Gallery and the Art College cater for painting, sculpture and performance art.\nLimerick is also home to comedians The Rubberbandits, D'Unbelievables (Pat Shortt and Jon Kenny) and Karl Spain. Dolan's Warehouse on the Dock Road is a venue specialising in live music, established in 1998. Baker Place was a nightclub that held mainly local underground nights until its closure in 2011. In 2020, it was announced that the Dromkeen-based Shiloh Trust was seeking planning permission to convert the former premises of Baker Place into a bible school. The Crush 87 nightclub (formerly known as Trinity Rooms until its closure in 2010), was relaunched in 2013.The city is the setting for Frank McCourt's memoir Angela's Ashes and the film adaptation. The Frank McCourt Museum situated in Frank's former school on Hartsonge Street opened in 2011 and contains artefacts from the book. Limerick has also been the setting or location for a number of other films, including the dramas The Real Thing (2002), Cowboys & Angels (2003) and Lost & Found (2015).Riverfest is a summer festival held annually in Limerick since 2004. The 2014 festival was held in May and had a record 80,000 visitors.\n\n\n== Humorous verse ==\nA limerick is a type of humorous verse of five lines with an AABBA rhyme scheme: the poem's connection with the city is obscure, but the name is generally taken to be a reference to Limerick city or County Limerick, sometimes particularly to the Maigue Poets, and may derive from an earlier form of nonsense verse parlour game that traditionally included a refrain that included \"Will [or won't] you come (up) to Limerick?\" The earliest known use of the name \"Limerick\" for this type poem is an 1880 reference, in a Saint John, New Brunswick newspaper, to an apparently well-known tune.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Broadcasting ===\nRT\u00c9 lyric fm, a state-run classical music radio station and part of RT\u00c9, broadcasts nationally from studios in the city centre on Cornmarket Square which opened in 1994. Limerick's local radio station is Live 95FM, broadcasting from 'Radio House', near the waterfront at Steamboat Quay. Spin South West, owned by Communicorp, broadcasts to Counties Kerry, Clare, Limerick, Tipperary and southwest Laois from its studios at Landmark Buildings in the Raheen Industrial Estate. Student radio station, Wired FM, broadcasts on 99.9FM from Mary Immaculate College. Wired FM also has studios in Limerick Institute of Technology. University Hospital Limerick has a radio station on 94.2FM, but this can be heard only in the hospital and surrounding area. West Limerick 102 is broadcast from Newcastle West. The national broadcaster, RT\u00c9, has radio and television studios in the city, which are periodically used to broadcast programming from Limerick.\n\n\n=== Print ===\nSeveral local newspapers are published in the city, including The Limerick Post and The Limerick Leader and magazines include the Limerick Event Guide, Business Limerick and Limerick Now.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\nLimerick city is approximately 25 km from Shannon Airport. Tourist attractions in the city centre include Limerick City Museum, King John's Castle (1210), St Mary's Cathedral (1168), the Hunt Museum, the University of Limerick, Georgian houses and gardens and the Treaty Stone.  There are several seasonal tours, including Angela's Ashes walking tour of Limerick City, historical walking tour, and boat tours along the River Shannon.\nThe city centre is divided between the traditional areas of \"English Town\" on the southern end of King's Island, which includes the King John's Castle; \"Irish Town\", which includes the older streets on the south bank; and the current economic centre further south, called \"Newtown Pery\". Newtown Pery was built in the late 18th century before the Act of Union and, unusually for an Irish city and unique in Limerick, is laid out on a grid plan. The Limerick City Museum (formerly aka the Jim Kemmy Municipal Museum), is located in Istabraq Hall, City Hall, Merchant's Quay. It contains displays on Limerick's history and manufactures.\n\nThe Georgian core of the city, with its Georgian architecture in the Newtown Pery, was developed from the mid 18th century. This core includes O'Connell Street (George Street before independence) from the Cecil Street intersection running to the south west end of the Crescent, and south-east to Pery Street including Glentworth Street and Barrington Street. Other buildings of architectural note in the city are St John's Cathedral, designed by the notable Victorian architect, Philip Charles Hardwick. St Mary's Cathedral, at over 800 years old, is one of the oldest in Ireland. St John's Cathedral, whilst more modern, has Ireland's tallest spire at 94 m (308 ft).\nThe Hunt Museum is based in the historic 18th-century former Custom House. The museum was established to house a collection of approximately 2000 works of art and antiquities formed by John and Gertrude Hunt during their lifetimes.\nThe main park in Limerick is the People's Park which was opened in 1877 in memory of Richard Russell, a prominent local business man. The park is dominated by the Thomas Spring Rice memorial (MP for the city 1820\u20131832) and has a large collection of mature deciduous and evergreen trees.\nLimerick city centre changed significantly with the construction of several modern high-rise buildings in the early 2000s, in particular as part of the regeneration of the former docks area along the Dock Road. The suburban areas, where the majority of the population now live, have grown out from the centre along the main roads to Ennis (North Circular and Ennis Road areas/Caherdavin), Dublin (Castletroy and the University) and Cork (Ballinacurra/Dooradoyle/Raheen). Suburban houses are generally two-floor semi-detached homes for single families. These were built from the 1950s onwards in large estates by government projects and commercial developments, although there are many examples of Edwardian and older 1930s suburban homes on the main suburban thoroughfares leading towards the city (North & South Circular, Ballinacurra Road, O'Connell Avenue).\n\nLimerick city's nightlife is supported by a number of nightclubs and pubs which offer music. For example, Dolan's Warehouse is a small music venue which hosts local, national and international folk, indie, jazz, rock and traditional Irish music acts.In County Limerick, Adare village and the Foynes Flying Boat Museum, approximately 35 km (22 miles/30 minutes) from Limerick City along the scenic coastal N69 route from Limerick to Tralee, are also attractions. Bunratty Castle in County Clare is another local attraction, and is situated 15.4 km north of the city. Limerick is known to be the antipodes to the Campbell Islands of New Zealand.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nLimerick is the third largest city in Ireland (after Dublin and Cork) with a population of 94,192 in the urban area and 104,952 in the metropolitan district, according to the 2016 CSO census. The past census reported a large population decline in central city areas due in part to the Limerick regeneration process where in these areas the largest reduction was reported nationally and also to outward migration following the collapse of the local and national economy from 2008 onwards. The population of the Limerick Larger Urban Zone as defined by the EU is 162,413. The ethnic diversity in Limerick's population, which includes a large immigrant community, saw rapid growth during the Celtic Tiger and the following decade. The Polish community is one of the largest demographic groups in the Municipal District, with approximately 4,000 living and working in the area. Ireland's first Polish bank opened in 2007. The African community has set up a number of churches, which are now part of the cultural makeup of the city.Limerick has a large stock of local authority housing. Prior to the merger of Limerick City and County Council 41% of all housing within the old Limerick City Council boundary was local authority, which was the highest in Ireland. This figure is however no longer accurate given the larger metropolitan district of the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nLimerick is in the region dubbed \"the Midwest\". Also known as the \"Shannon Region\", this is primarily an economic and social concept. The region encompasses County Limerick, County Clare, North County Tipperary, Northwest County Kerry and south County Offaly, with its focal point centred on Limerick and its environs within an 8-kilometre (5 mi) radius.\nThe area is the main economic region in Ireland outside Dublin and Cork. Its economic development has been driven in part by the University of Limerick, Limerick Institute of Technology, Shannon Airport in County Clare and Shannon Development (an economic development agency), whose precursor was SFADCO (Shannon Free Airport Development Company), an economic agency that provided tax incentives to companies locating in the area surrounding Shannon Airport. As of 2006 Shannon Development was mostly concerned with disposing of valuable industrial park properties. Limerick Chamber of Commerce, a representative body for businesses in the region, celebrated its bicentennial/bicentenary in 2015.\nHistorically Limerick was an agricultural commodity-driven economy, due to its position as the first major port along the River Shannon. By the middle of the 18th century, Limerick Port grew to become one of Ireland's principal commercial ports, exporting agricultural produce from the most fertile tracts in Ireland known as the Golden Vale as well as produce from the surrounding counties. The city was one of the main meat processing areas in Ireland, and industry included confectionery and flour production. The city was known for its bacon industry \u2013 however this went into decline in the mid-20th century. The fishing industry in Limerick, based on Clancy's Strand opposite King John's Castle and at Coonagh nearby, once employed hundreds of men. The boat most commonly used was the Gandelow which was also used as a small Lighter (barge) to ferry goods to and from larger ships in the port. In the 1920s the construction of a dam at Ardnacrusha severely impacted salmon breeding and that, and the introduction of quotas, had by the 1950s caused salmon fishing to diminish. By 2006, most fishermen had relinquished their drift net licences and the industry can now be said to be dormant.As with other cities in Ireland, a number of multinational companies are based in Limerick, and the city is a growing recipient of foreign direct investment. Dell had its main European Manufacturing Facility at the Raheen Business Park however in January 2009 Dell announced that it would close its Limerick computer manufacturing plant and move the production lines to Poland. The facility was the largest Dell manufacturing plant outside the United States and produced 30,000\u201360,000 units per day for export to the EMEA. Dell remains one of the largest employers in the mid-west with over 1,000 people employed in service and support. Analog Devices has its European manufacturing base in Raheen, 3 km south-west of the city centre. The site employs more than 1,000 people. Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Vistakon (the world's largest manufacturer of contact lenses) has a large facility in Castletroy in the National Technology Park and also employs close to 1,000 people. It is Vistakon's only production facility outside the United States and one of the largest contact-lens manufacturing plants in the world. Cook Medical, the world's largest privately owned Medical Devices company, employs over 800 people in Limerick at the National Technology Park.\nThe Post-2008 Irish economic downturn had a profound effect on Limerick. The announcement in 2009 that Dell was to move its manufacturing facility from Limerick to Poland devastated the local economy. 1,900 jobs were lost at Dell and it is believed that for every job that was lost at Dell at least another 4 to 5 were at risk. The closure of the Dell manufacturing facility amounted to 2% of Ireland's national GDP. The downturn in the construction industry also cost many jobs as did the stalled Limerick regeneration programme which promised investment in Limerick's deprived city areas. As of 2012 unemployment had become a major problem across the city with the unemployment rate in the city at 28.6% which was almost twice the national average.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nThe Crescent Shopping Centre is the largest shopping centre in Ireland, outside of Dublin, and the largest in the province of Munster. It is located in Dooradoyle about 3 km south of the city centre, and has over 90 shopping outlets along with restaurants and a 12-screen Omniplex Cinema. The city centre also has a large retail district which includes a mix of more traditional type of shops as well as some modern high street stores. Cruises Street is one of the main shopping streets. O'Connell Street, William Street, Bedford Row and Thomas Street) are also retail streets within the city. The city centre saw some works on remodelling in the early 21st century, with pedestrianisation works on Bedford Row, Thomas Street and parts of Catherine Street, as well as widening footpaths on William Street. These works have sought to address a reduction of footfall in the city centre (in turn influencing the closure of many city centre retail businesses) which occurred from the recession of 2008 onwards.\n\n\n==== Retail parks and shopping centres ====\n\nDuring the Celtic Tiger years a number of shopping centres and retail parks opened in suburban areas of Limerick. In addition to the Crescent Shopping Centre, which expanded in the early 2000s, the Jetland Shopping Centre opened in Caherdavin in 2005. The Childers Road Retail Park and the Parkway Shopping Centre in the east of the city also have a number of high street stores. Unfinished retail centres include the Coonagh Cross retail development and the Parkway Valley Shopping Centre on the Dublin Road. A proposed but unapproved retail development project, the Opera Centre, makes up part of the \"Limerick 2030\" scheme.\n\n\n==== The Milk Market ====\nThe Milk Market located at Cornmarket Row in the city centre sells locally produced foods and products and is governed by Limerick Market Trustees. In 2010 work was undertaken to redevelop the existing premises to an all-weather, all year round facility as it operated in an outdoor environment. The work involved constructing a large canopy over the existing market premises and was officially re-opened in June 2010. The Milk Market Project won the 2011 Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI) 'Peoples Choice Award'.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nIn 2013, a renewable energy strategy was launched for the region, and proposed a 20% reduction in CO2-emissions, while ensuring that short-term actions were beneficial to the long-term goal of 100% renewable energy. The strategy was completed by the Danish Aalborg University.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\nShannon Airport is 20 km west of the city in County Clare. It is one of Ireland's main airports and is easily accessible from Limerick via the N18 dual carriageway and from other regions via the Limerick Tunnel. It has scheduled flights to European and North American destinations. Airlines using the airport include Ryanair, Aer Lingus, United Airlines, American Airlines, Aer Lingus Regional and Delta Air Lines. There is no rail link to the airport. Coonagh airfield, a few kilometres west of Caherdavin, serves small private aircraft. Kerry and Cork Airports are around 1 hour 30 minutes and 2 hours drive away, respectively. Kerry Airport is connected to Farranfore railway station, from Limerick railway station travel via Limerick Junction and Mallow.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nLocal public transport is provided by several companies. Bus \u00c9ireann, Ireland's state-owned bus company, operates a number of services subsidised by the National Transport Authority, while a number of provide operators also run commercial bus services in and around Limerick. An updated city bus network was introduced in Limerick City in December 2016, which introduced new routes. In May 2019, Bus \u00c9ireann further changed and improved the Limerick City timetable, including increased frequency and later operating times.\nOther rural buses run to towns and villages in the county and to Shannon Airport. There are also a number of Intercity and international buses from Bus \u00c9ireann's bus terminal adjoining Limerick Colbert railway station. These include hourly services to Dublin, Cork, Ennis and Galway. Bus \u00c9ireann have also commenced a Limerick to Galway Express service travelling on the M18 in addition to the regular service. Buses run every 2 hours to Tralee and Killarney. There are also regular daily services to Waterford and Athlone, and a daily service to London via the ferry from Rosslare Europort.\nThere are a number of private bus companies in operation providing city and intercity services. Dublin Coach provide the M7 express service which operates every hour from Arthur's Quay which goes to Dublin or Ennis. JJ Kavanagh also provide Dublin to Limerick services from Arthur's Quay. Citylink run a number of services from Limerick to Galway and Cork and operate from Henry Street.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nIarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann's Limerick Colbert station is the railway hub for the city and the Mid West Region with a number of intercity and commuter rail services. Limerick railway station opened on 28 August 1858, replacing an earlier, temporary station 500 m east, which had operated from 9 May 1848.The following inter city routes are available from Limerick Colbert station :\n\nLimerick to Dublin Heuston: 16 services daily including 4 direct services. All remaining Dublin \u2013 Limerick services require passengers to change to the Dublin to Cork train at either Limerick Junction or at Ballybrophy railway station.\nLimerick to Waterford: 2 services daily (but none on Sundays). Passengers must change train at Limerick Junction to continue to Waterford with stations at Tipperary, Cahir, Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir.\nLimerick to Galway: 5 services daily. This service reopened on 29 March 2010.\nLimerick to Cork: Passengers can travel between Limerick and Cork via Limerick Junction. There is no direct service.\nLimerick to Killarney, Farranfore and Tralee: Passengers can travel between Limerick and Killarney, Farranfore and Tralee via Limerick Junction where trains run via Mallow to reach County Kerry.There are 3 suburban/commuter services in the Limerick Suburban Rail network:\n\nLimerick \u2013 Ennis calling at Sixmilebridge\nLimerick \u2013 Nenagh calling at Castleconnell and Birdhill (with some services continuing to Cloughjordan & Roscrea & connecting to the Dublin-Cork railway line at Ballybrophy.) Due to speed restrictions this alternative Dublin \u2013 Limerick route can take 60 minutes longer (with a change at Ballybrophy) than by Limerick Junction albeit a more direct service.\nLimerick \u2013 Limerick Junction and ThurlesThere are also a number of disused railway lines including the Limerick to Foynes line which closed to freight in the early 2000s, having lost passenger services in the early 1960s, although the track is still in situ.  This is the last remaining part of the North Kerry Line which closed to passenger traffic in the early 1960s and to freight traffic (other than Limerick \u2013 Foynes) in the mid-1970s, and has been lifted between Ballingrane (near Rathkeale) and Tralee.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nLimerick's central location in the mid\u2013west of Ireland means many national primary routes converge on the city. The M7 (Dublin), N/M18 (Galway, Ennis, Shannon), N/M20 (Cork), N21 (Tralee) and N24 (Waterford) routes all start/terminate in or near the city. Road infrastructure is further supplemented by the southern ring road and Limerick Tunnel bypass of the city and the M20 bypass of Dooradoyle and Raheen to the south of the city. Connections to the other cities were improved with the completion of the M7 motorway in December 2010, and continuing upgrades ongoing to the N/M18 to Shannon, Ennis, Galway and Tuam \u2013 the final section opened in September 2017. A motorway is also planned between Cork and Limerick, with a proposed completion date in the mid 2020s.\n\n\n=== Waterway transport ===\nHistorically, waterway transport has been key to Limerick's development. Vikings established the city as a maritime trading port. The city's position on a major Irish river system, the Shannon, enabled transport to the midlands of Ireland and further north and west. By the 18th century with the opening of canal systems throughout Ireland, Limerick Port established itself as Ireland's premier commercial port on the western side of the country. This was enabled by ease of access from the facilitated by the opening of canals but most importantly to the River Shannon. The opening of the Grand Canal in the 18th century provided further access to Dublin and the east of the country. There are also a number of disused canals in the vicinity of the city including the Park Canal & the Passey \u2013 Errina Canal on the old Limerick navigation. Waterway transport on the Shannon was regularly used to transport goods from Limerick to Dublin and vice versa however this mode of transport fell into decline in the 20th century. Originally Limerick port was located near the confluence of the Abbey and Shannon rivers at King's Island. Today the Shannon Foynes Port is located further downstream on the Shannon alongside the Dock Road. This general purpose facility port is operated by the Shannon Foynes Port Company who operate all marine activities in the Shannon estuary.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nLimerick is a centre of higher education in the region, and technical and continuation education within the city traces its beginning back to the formation of the Limerick Athenaeum Society in 1852, marking the foundation of the Limerick Institute of Technology.

It suffered a decline during the 1990s culminating in the complete demise of local league basketball in the city and surrounding areas. The main clubs in the city were St. Colm's and Marathon with St. Colm's in particular having a long history in the National Leagues.

          "What else does a human on holiday need? Take an amble around the free gallery which features local, national and some international exhibitions ( on occasion). The space is lovely. The building conversion into the art gallery is well done. Lots of space with occasional seating.",
          "Great space for a gallery. Very serene and great light in most of the rooms. Peaceful most of the time on a Sunday anyway and right next to the park so the kids can go mad afterwards. Swanzy exhibition was excellent as was Ryan (what is that white dog/llama). O'Dwyer was waaaay",
          "I find the place dreary and everytime I go in there , there showing art im not into .The permanant collection is just moved around the same room most of the time .I use to go there a bit . Its art that doesn`t inspire me and seems out dated and has a bang of 90s about it",
          "I really enjoy a visit her to the City Gallery, the setting is great, right beside the peoples park. Its not a huge place so you can easily get around in an hour or less, then again you can get lost in the exhibitions for hours on end. The trip can be rounded off with a visit",

          "Love this gallery. There is a permanent collection on rotation plus excellently curated exhibitions. This is a wonderful place to experience national and international artists, with sculpture, video, photography, painting, mixed media and more. The space is bright and well",
          "Our walk to the art museum took longer than our visit. Only 1 of 3 galleries was open (temporary exhibitions were being changed). Given the many other great options in Limerick, our time would have been better spent doing anything else.",

          "When I visited they had a really good exhibition called \"Cumann: An audio map Limerick\" which I really enjoyed. The other exhibitions at the time was good as well, but didn't really leave any impact at me. I guess the experience depends much on what exhibitions they have at the",

          "This little art museum is hit and miss I have found. It just depends on what is on show. Nice to wander through if you are looking for something to do but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it. Nice cafe attached to it and People's Park is adjacent.",

      "name": "The Milk Market",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Milk Market (Irish: Margadh an Bhainne) is a food market located on Mungret Street, Limerick, Ireland. Despite the name, the market has diversified over the years from its initial purpose and now sells a wide variety of foodstuffs, much of which is produced locally. The market is one of the oldest in Ireland. The flagship market day is the Saturday food market, however, markets are also held on Fridays & Sundays.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe exact origins of The Milk Market are unknown but its location on Mungret Street in Limerick's Irishtown area can suggest a pre 19th century origin. In the early 19th century, there were a number of markets located in and around the city. It was suggested at this time that the various markets would be brought under a single management system. The Limerick Market Trustees was set up by an Act of the British Parliament, passed in 1852, to expand and manage the affairs of markets within the city boundary and its environs. In order to fulfill their charter the Trustees raised finance and acquired a large parcel of land in the Garryowen area of the city where many of the markets were relocated with the original market properties disposed of. The Butter Market, the Pig Market and the Hay Market were transferred to the new market area. The new market area eventually became a sports ground as is now known as the Markets Field stadium as eventually over time these markets began to fail. The Potato Market (on Merchant's Quay near the old Limerick Port) and the Corn Market (latterly known as the Milk Market) were retained in their original locations. The Potato Market ended in the 1940s, however the Corn Market or Milk Market, continued to thrive.  The nature of the produce traded there also changed. In addition to the sale of fruit and vegetables there was also lively trade in fowl, homemade butter and homemade breads and cakes. It was not until the 1950s that the market for bedding plants and shrubs began to grow and this range of produce expanded rapidly in the 1960s. Another feature of the Market during this period was the Christmas market for turkeys. Through much of its history (1897 - 1988) the Limerick Market Trustees was in receivership the longest receivership period in Irish history. Following the release of the Trustees from receivership an ambitious renovation of the Milk Market was undertaken. This project won a European Heritage Award and it was reopened on September 1, 1995.\n\n\n== Redevelopment ==\nIn 2004, the Trustees identified the need and the opportunity to undertake significant new works at Milk Market, in order to make it one of the finest markets in Ireland. These plans were realised in June 2010, with the opening of the redeveloped Milk Market as an all-weather, all year round market space following the construction of a large canopy over the top of the open air market. The venue now accommodates major markets on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays & occasional markets at other times, a daily Christmas market on the run up to Christmas; a new Food Pavilion and events. The Milk Market Project won the 2011 Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI) 'Peoples Choice Award'. Local architects Healy Partners Architects designed the project in conjunction with Schlaich Bergermann & Partner from Stuttgart, Germany. Also involved were local civil and structural engineers Dennany Reidy Associates.\n\n\n== Live at the Big \u2014 Top ==\n\nSince its redevelopment The Milk Market now also doubles as an entertainment venue with events marketed as Live at the Big \u2014 Top. Numerous top Irish & International music acts that have played at the venue since its redevelopment include:\n\nSin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor\nThe Coronas\nImelda May\nBell X1\nVillagers\nThe Stunning\nCalvin Harris\nThe Feeling\nThe Saw Doctors\nJosh Ritter\n\n\n== See also ==\nEnglish Market, Cork\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Had great expectations going here as I had heard a lot about this market and thought it would be as good as the English Market in Cork but it is quite different and actually nothing like it really. It is more akin to a covered car boot sale with some classic eateries in the mix.",
          "I have travelled to limerick 4 times now since discovering the milk markets (a journey of over 2 hours each way) . There should be one in every county. I visited on a Saturday each time for the food market. The quality of the produce available is fantastic. Fresh meats & fish,",
          "Was there on friday. About 3 stalls open and booked there really. Maybe better at the weekend but avoid during the week anyway.",
          "Went to see Sinead O'Connor and the venue was absolutely hands down one of my favourite ever venues for a music gig. No matter where you stand in here you get a great view of the stage yet you're protected from the elements and wind and rain etc but still great air flow unlike",
          "Milk market is well worth a visit for lovely food & some Irish culture. The highlight of the trip was listening to 83 year old Tom MacNamra playing his accordium (think it was an accordium) at the market. He played Fields of Athenry for us. Lovely man.",
          "A must do stop for your itinerary. Tons of authentic Irish vendors and farmers with handmade crafts to fresh eggs and cheeses to homegrown flowers and veggies and everything in between. I even picked up some beautiful hand made pottery and soaps. One of our favorite stops in",
          "Food, crafts, gifts - you will find it all here! Great why to spend a day looking around whether you're a tourist or a local",
          "Great experience. Very few stalls on a Sunday. Saturday is ment to be a better day to visit. I got a Fab dress for 2 euro and a brand new handbag for 5 euro.",
          "The market is very much visited, as much from locals as from tourists. There are a number of stalls, almost all of them are different items of food. Around the milk market itself is another market in the streets with all kinds of things (like second hand books, a personal",

          "Our friend brought us here,told me that I have to see this market. Now I must say everybody has to see this Saturday market if visiting Limerick. All farmers/artisan producers. Lovely fresh food prepared all around. Rooftop terrasse to sit down and chill with food and drink. My",

          "The Farmer\u2019s market portion is only on Saturday. That said, there are a few bright spots on Sunday if that\u2019s the only day you can go. Handmade bagels! Yum!!! Fresh made crisps - heavenly! And the stand started by 16yo to support her goal to get to the Olympics. Great",
          "I have enjoyed visits to many city markets around the world, and Milk Market compares favorably. It is not as large , or as varied, as some. The basic food groups were covered. A number of vendors sold non-food items like candles , soaps etc. ALL vendors were very friendly and",
          "We read reviews which said this was a great place for brunch on Sunday. True food was great - crepes were the favourite but the Cure sandwich was also enjoyed and great coffee from stall. Very few of the craft stalls open. If you\u2019re here on a Saturday it\u2019s probably a good stop.",
          "The info we had told us the market is open on Friday, Sat and Sun so we went along today only to find about 5% of all traders there! Such a disappointment. Most of the cafes and bars etc are open, but really, that's it! Two of the caf\u00e9 staff told us we HAD to go back on Saturday",
          "Originally we were told to go on a Sunday, but that was proven to be so-so info.... we tried again the next Saturday and found an excellent assortment of food, produce and just about any craft or tool you might want.... great way to spend a Saturday morning and deals galore!",
          "We went on Sunday. The day to go is Saturday, according to the reviews. On Sunday mostly old records and CDs \ud83d\udcbf for sale. Some other arts and crafts but I\u2019d skip it. Hint: If you\u2019re \ud83d\udc40 looking for it, look for the big white circus \ud83c\udfaa tent top. Street parking is not plentiful",

          "Friends were staying in the summer so headed into the Milk Market to show them what it\u2019s like on a busy Saturday morning. Toddlers had fun munching crepes and adults enjoyed purchasing fresh fruit, olives and much more. Coffee on the go and a people watching haven! Brill!",
          "We visited on a Sunday morning and were disappointed to find so many places closed. However several interesting places were open. A art market dominated the central space with a great range of affordable art. We found a great delicatessen stall with breads, meat, cheese and a",

          "We arrived just after opening time and fluked a street parking spot not far from the market. We were looking for coffee before heading off to the cliffs of Moher and found much more than coffee. Great fresh veges, cakes, bread and produce like cheese, meats and fish. Characters",
          "Right in the heart of Limerick, this farmer's market/flea market hybrid has many interesting little stands and shops. Note: parking can be a problem, so walk or Uber there if you're staying in Limerick. Saturday is the best day to go, I was there on a Friday and it was mostly",
          "The Milk Market has a lot of local produce. It's not had to find, the centre of Limerick is not very large. The Milk Market is very busy on Sundays, especially if it is fine. It's open Sundays, but the pace is slower.",
          "Came here as we enjoy farmers markets. Some great local treats. Not as large as I had thought but enough to walk around and try different foods and drinks in less than an hour. If I lived here I would be by regularly to pick up stuff. As a tourist I\u2019m glad I stopped in. It was",

          "We absolutely love checking out local markets when we are abroad and The Milk Market did not disappoint! Part flea market, part food market and part fresh veggies there is an array of vendors and things to check out or sample. Definitely worth checking out, it\u2019s a great blended",

          "Went twice on our trip with a family of eight. It is exactly what you would expect your Farmers Market to be... Really neat and unique vendors, fresh fruits and vegetables, fish and meats. You can sit and have lunch and coffee and do your shopping. My only complaint is the lack",
          "Not great, some nice stalls but they are in the minority. A lot of stalls with tat on them, you walk around it in 5 minutes really not worth the time to seek out.",

          "We were there on a Friday and there was almost no one there. We were very disappointed. Definitely not worth looking for.",
          "It was a sunny, warm (for April) Saturday morning and we thoroughly enjoyed walking among the vendors and seeing all they had to offer. Although we did not purchase anything it all looked delicious. I only wish we had something similar to the Milk Market where we lived.",
          "We came quite late looking for some lunch, and sellers were starting to pack up- so go early. But great atmosphere and we had a phenomenal steak baguette, cooked freshly to order in front of us by very chatty lovely staff! Couldn\u2019t have wanted more!",
          "Great to get you out of bed on Saturday mornings (8 to 3 although some stalls will finish up earlier if sold out) and there's Yoga on Sunday mornings. Tasty breakfast/lunch options in addition to plenty of baked goods, jam, honey, crepes, cheese, dried meats. Greek, Turkish &",
          "Great atmosphere both inside and outside the market, great diversity of stalls, carrots to carats, great food stalls, you will not go hungry.",
          "This place was very busy when we visited on a Saturday. Lots of local farmers selling organic vegetables, Wood, baked items. The works. Not far from the main shopping streets in the City centre",
          "We went here expecting to have lots of things to explore- we were done within 10 mins. This had 3 booths and the stalls were only food. We were hungry so we were out of there pretty quick..... if you are eating I would recommend it shopping no.",
          "We enjoyed a wander around The Milk Market mid morning on Saturday. It was bustling with a good variety of food stalls and a few crafts, clothing and other bits & bobs. There was a couple of street musicians too. It was an hour well spent.",
          "Stopped in on a Friday just before 10 and the place was almost empty with only a few vendors setting up. Didn't stick around because we were on our way out of town for the day. We stopped in again on Saturday afternoon and couldn't believe the difference. It was just booming.",
          "Visited on. A Sunday so most of the general market closed but that didn't disappoint me. Quite the opposite. Enticing shops as well as cafes on offer. Had a delightful brunch. With Tipperary Apple juice to boot. What's. Not to like??",
          "I adore local markets and this one did not dissapoint me at all! The variety of food you could taste was amazing - from healthy salads through cooked-on-demand fresh fish, to baclava!also hand made jewelery and other treasures. Only be aware of the huge number of people visiting",
          "Went on a late Friday morning. There was nothing but empty tables. The fresh produce and farmers market is only on Saturday. Very disappointing.",
          "Milk Market was top on my list when visiting Limerick end of July '17 and I was not disappointed. One of the biggest weekend market of this always fascinating country was the covered variety of delicacies: fresh breads, mushroom stalls, a must dive into amazing herbal cheeses",
          "I have loved this market for years now. Always has a great selection of food from local farmers and companies. There is a friendly atmosphere and buzz. Highly recommend stopping by the Milk Market on Saturday or Sunday morning if you are staying in Limerick!",
          "Considering I'd seen tours to go to the Milk market I thought it would be a lot bigger. It's nice that it's undercover and there's a variety of different stalls. It can get very busy and pushy, so hold on to your kids!",
          "Great chocolate shop inside - Wild Irish Chocolates - & donut shop - Funky Donut Co, as well as lots of other fresh food & a really cool vintage shop & vintage bookseller on the outside. Brilliant! Lovely & filled with bargains + a great cuppa coffee. Limerick is wonderful!!",
          "Great place to experience the local culture, eat well and chat with the lovely Irish people. A public market is always a great option.",
          "A small area to search for local goods; they have handmade soaps, vintage items, homemade pastries, and some fruits and vegetables. They have food stalls there for hungry shoppers.",
          "My family is from around Castleconnel, we took the kids to the market some time back and they had fun while we explored what there is on offer.",
          "We were only in Limerick on one day - a Friday - so headed for the Milk Market for lunch. Got there at about 11.15 and things were very quiet, with just a few stallholders open and a few more setting up. Something less than the hustle and bustle we had expected, though we did",

          "It's a lovely market, okay the stalls may not be very different or out there but they do have some lovely produce. The cheese stands and the Indian curry stall is brilliant.",
          "So the market is at its best on a Saturday - Friday and Sunday are much quieter days with lots more space to sit and enjoy the static food and coffee stalls. You'll need to be up and out early on the Saturday to see the best of limericks hard working food and craft producers",
          "The Milk Market certainly has history towards it, but there is nothing too special about it. Not very large, just your normal fruit, vegetable and hot food stalls.",
          "not a lot of stalls open as it was a bitter cold rainy day, but the ones that were were absolutely brilliant, we met a very lovely friendly lady on one stall who sold me a brand new pair of ugg trainers and a pair of almost new boots for 12euro cant go wrong there, she was ever",
          "The market has a little bit of everything. The hot food was great and there was no shortage of fresh produce to choose from. There is a variety of other things for sale such as tools and homemade baskets when I was there as well. A must do when in Limerick City.",
          "I've been coming to the Marley for years and it is by far the best thing about limerick. You've got to be in early to see all the delights that are quickly snapped up and to soak up the atmosphere. If you'r e planning a visit to limerick get should be on your list for a",
          "Apart from the array of produce on offer from small producers selling fruit & veg, meat, fish, charcuterie, cheeses etc, there's plenty of baked goods and opportunities to just graze... Try the breakfast rolls or the seafood from Rene Cusack, the crepes, a curry from Green",

      "name": "Adare Desmond Castle",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Adare (; Irish: \u00c1th Dara, meaning \"ford of [the] oak\") is a village in County Limerick, Ireland, located south-west of the city of Limerick. Renowned as one of Ireland's prettiest towns, Adare is designated as a heritage town by the Irish government.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe River Maigue is tidal as far as Adare, with the settlement forming around the eastern bank of the Maigue overlooking the fording point from which the village gets its name. An annalistic reference is made in the medieval Annals of Inisfallen at AI982.4 \"The Tree of Mag Adar was broken by Leth Cuinn\". Owing to the strategic importance of the river crossing the Desmond castle was built overlooking the site near Ardshanbally (derived from Ard an tSeanbhaile - 'high ground of the old town'), and was first mentioned in 1226. Historically a market town, in the Middle Ages, Adare boasted three monasteries. Owing to the influence of the Earls of Dunraven, who built the Adare Manor (now a luxury resort hotel) a strict plan was laid out for the town.\n\n\n=== Desmond Castle ===\n\nA castle or fortress is said to have first been built with an ancient ring-fort, by the O'Donovans, rulers of the region into the late 12th century, and afterwards to have passed into the possession of the Kildare branch of the FitzGerald dynasty, who may be responsible for the majority of the remains of the present fortress (which occurred with Croom Castle, also on the Maigue). Desmond Castle, as it is popularly known, stands on the north bank of the Maigue. An extensive renovation has been in progress on the castle since 1996 and supervised tours are offered in the summer months.  This is one of a series of significant Desmond properties, which also include Desmond Hall and Castle in Newcastle West, another castle in Askeaton and Castle Matrix near Rathkeale, further west in County Limerick.\n\n\n=== Augustinian Priory ===\n\nAdare's Augustinian Priory was founded in 1316 by John FitzThomas FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Kildare. The Priory was suppressed in the reign of Henry VIII. In 1807, the church of the Priory was given to the local Church of Ireland congregation as the parish church. In 1814, the refectory was roofed and converted into a schoolhouse. Between 1852 and 1854, a second restoration of the church was undertaken by Caroline, Countess of Dunraven.\n\n\n=== Franciscan Abbey ===\nThe Franciscan friary was founded in 1464 by Thomas Fitz-Maurice, 7th Earl of Kildare and his wife Joan, and completed two years later. It is currently a ruin and is located inside the Adare Manor Golf Club.\n\n\n=== Trinitarian Abbey ===\n\nThe Trinitarian Order established their only monastery in Ireland in Adare in 1230. It is believed that the Trinitarian monks who came to Adare may have come from Scotland. The Abbey was restored in 1811 by the first Earl of Dunraven as the Catholic Parish church.\n\n\n=== Adare Manor ===\nAdare Manor is a mansion located on lands on the banks of the River Maiguem and the former seat of the Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl. The present building was built in the early 19th-century in a Tudor-revival style, while retaining part of an earlier structure. It is now the Adare Manor Hotel & Golf Resort, a luxury resort hotel, reopened after an extensive restoration in October 2017.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe main street combines typical Irish architecture with the English styled buildings and infrastructure purpose-built for the Dunraven estate. Examples of the latter architectural forms include the thatched cottages near the entrance to Adare Manor.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAdare is a tourist destination and the local heritage centre, which gives insight into the history of the village, also hosts a number of craft shops. The village is a wedding and conference venue. Adare has two 18-hole golf courses - the Adare Golf Club, which incorporates a driving range and which was the site of the 2007 and 2008 Irish Open, the Adare Manor Golf Club and a pitch and putt course. Adare also has an equestrian centre, located  in Clonshire.\n\n\n=== Schools ===\nThere are four primary schools in Adare: St Joseph's National School (Catholic, boys), Our Lady's Abbey National School (Catholic, girls), St Nicholas' National School (Church of Ireland, mixed) and Shountrade National School (Catholic, mixed). The village's secondary school, Adare CBS, closed in 1973.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nThe main Limerick-Tralee road, the N21 passes through the village, causing persistent heavy congestions.  In late 2015 a corridor for the long-delayed bypass was chosen that realigns the N21 road north of the village as part of a new dual carriageway planned to link Foynes port to Limerick.\nAdare is a stop on Bus \u00c9ireann's Limerick-Tralee/Killarney bus service and Dublin Coach's Dublin-Tralee/Killarney service. Both run hourly.\nThe abandoned \"Limerick-Foynes\" railway line passes 800 metres (half a mile) to the north-west of the town. Adare railway station, opened on 12 July 1856 by the Limerick & Foynes Railway company, was closed to passengers on 4 February 1963 and to freight on 2 December 1974. The line to Foynes continued to carry freight traffic until it was mothballed in 2001 and has seen no trains since 7 May 2002 when the annual Irish Rail weedspray train visited the line. The line, designated an engineers siding, is still officially open for traffic.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nAdare GAA club was founded in 1929. The senior hurling team has won the county championship in 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 and 2009. In football, the Club won the County Intermediate Football Title in 2016 and gained promotion back to The Limerick Senior Football Championship. In 2017, Adare won the County Senior Title for the first time, beating Newcastle West in the Final. In 2018, the club went on to retain the title, becoming the first team in Limerick GAA history to win 2 senior titles immediately following success at intermediate level.\nThe local soccer team is Adare United AFC. The club play at Deer Park Field, situated just off the Blackabbey Road in the village. Founded in 1937, Adare has one of the oldest soccer clubs outside Limerick city. Adare United participate in the Limerick Desmond Schoolboys/Girls League at Under 8, U10, U12, U14 and U16 age groups and in the Limerick Desmond League at Junior (adult) and Youth level. The 2006/07 Season saw the club form its first ladies team, who compete in the Limerick Desmond Ladies League. In the 2009/10 Season, the ladies were runners up in the League Cup, losing on penalties to Glin Rovers FC. The team were also cup finalists the following year, this time in the Desmond Cup but were beaten by Murroe FC. The Under 10 team were Division 3 Champions in the 2008/09 season and Division 4 winners in 2010/11. The Under 8 team completed a league and cup double in 2010/11. The Junior team won promotion from Division Two in the 2008/2009 season and immediately gained promotion to the premier league the following year. Adare Ladies won the Desmond Cup in the 2011/2012 season and were runners-up in League Division 1.\nThe Irish Open golf championship was staged there in 2007 and 2008. There are two 18-hole golf courses in the village: The Adare Golf Club which is on the grounds of the Adare Manor Hotel, and the Adare Manor Golf Club, which is a separate entity.\nThe Limerick Cricket Club play in the manor fields complex to the south of the village.\nThe town also plays a role in the West Limerick athletics scene, with it hosting the Adare 10K run every February since 1994.\n\n\n== Twin towns ==\nAdare has twinning connections to its sister towns in Germany.\n\nBuchloe, Germany\nBuckow, Germany\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of towns and villages in Ireland\nNicholas Peacock\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAdare Heritage Centre\nShannon Region Tourism's page on Adare\nGeneral Information on Adare\nObituary of the 7th Earl of Dunraven, Thady Wyndham-Quin\nIndex of the Earl of Dunraven Papers at the University of Limerick\nAdare local area plan (Limerick County Council)(2002)\nThe Tidy Towns of Ireland \"Celebrating 50 years\"\nKnockpatrick Gardens\nBunbury, Turtle, Adare Manor: The Renaissance of an Irish Country House (Adare Manor Publishing, 2019) ISBN 9781527246706",

          "The only way to see this castle is by guided tour and the price is very reasonable. Tickets are available at the Adare visitor center in town and the price includes a bus ride to the site. The castle itself is mostly in ruins but it is amazing to be looking at something from",

          "The entrance fee to Curraghchase park is 5 euro per car. and during the busier summer times it is understandable to see why considering the car park is often fully packed out despite the fee. That aside Curraghechase Forest Park is a nice area for a picnic, bbq, and walks",

          "This park is a great place to let children really run freely. It is also nice for an adult stroll. There is a big old ruined house and lovely lawns and it is easy to imagine what it must have been like in past times with a Lord of the Manor in residence and all the trappings.",

          "It costs \u20ac5 entrance per car, which you pay on your way in \u2013 the barrier automatically lifts when you are on your way out.

        "wiki": "Limerick (; Irish: Luimneach [\u02c8l\u032a\u02e0\u026am\u02b2(\u0259)n\u02b2\u0259x]) is a city in County Limerick, Ireland. It is located in the Mid-West Region and is also part of the province of Munster. With a population of 94,192 at the 2016 census, Limerick is the third-most populous urban area in the state, and the fourth-most populous city on the island of Ireland. The city lies on the River Shannon, with the historic core of the city located on King's Island, which is bounded by the Shannon and Abbey Rivers. Limerick is also located at the head of the Shannon Estuary, where the river widens before it flows into the Atlantic Ocean. Limerick City and County Council is the local authority for the city.\n\n\n== Geography and political subdivisions ==\nAt the 2016 census, the Metropolitan District of Limerick had a population of 104,952. On 1 June 2014 following the merger of Limerick City and County Council, a new Metropolitan District of Limerick was formed within the united council, which extended the city area. The Metropolitan District includes the city urban area and extends outwards towards Patrickswell in the west and Castleconnell in the east. The City Metropolitan Area however excludes city suburbs located within County Clare.\nLimerick is one of the constituent cities of the Cork\u2013Limerick\u2013Galway corridor, which has a population of 1 million people. It is located at a strategic position on the River Shannon with four main crossing points near the city centre. To the south of the city is the Golden Vale, an area of rich pastureland. Historically, much of the city's industry was based on this rich agricultural hinterland, and it is particularly noted for Limerick ham.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient and medieval history ===\nLuimneach originally referred to the general area along the banks of the Shannon Estuary known as Loch Luimnigh. The earliest settlement in the city, Inis Sibhtonn, was the original name for King's Island during the pre-Viking and Viking eras. This island was also called Inis an Ghaill Duibh, 'The Dark-(haired) Foreigner's Island'. The name is recorded in Viking sources as Hlymrekr.\nThe city dates from 812; however, history suggests the presence of earlier settlements in the area surrounding King's Island, the island at the historical city centre. Antiquity's map-maker, Ptolemy, produced in 150 the earliest map of Ireland, showing a place called Regia at the same site as King's Island. History also records an important battle involving Cormac mac Airt in 221 and a visit by Saint Patrick in 434 to baptise an E\u00f3ganachta king, Carthann the Fair. Saint Munchin, the first bishop of Limerick died in 652, indicating the city was a place of some note. In 812 the Vikings sailed up the Shannon and pillaged the city, burned the monastery of Mungret but were forced to flee when the Irish attacked and killed many of their number. The Normans redesigned the city in the 12th century and added much of the most notable architecture, such as King John's Castle and St Mary's Cathedral.In early medieval times Limerick was at the centre of the Kingdom of Thomond which corresponds to the present day County Clare, the Kingdom also included North Kerry and parts of South Offaly. One of the kingdom's most notable kings was Brian Boru, ancestor of the O'Brien Clan of Dalcassians. The word Thomond is synonymous with the region and is retained in place names such as Thomondgate, Thomond Bridge and Thomond Park.\n\n\n=== Late Renaissance/Early modern history ===\n\nLimerick in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was often called the most beautiful city in Ireland. The English-born judge Luke Gernon, a resident of Limerick, wrote in 1620 that at his first sight of the city he had been amazed at its magnificence: \"lofty buildings of marble, like the Colleges in Oxford\".During the civil wars of the 17th century the city played a pivotal role, besieged by Oliver Cromwell in 1651 and twice by the Williamites in the 1690s. The Treaty of Limerick ended the Williamite war in Ireland which was fought between supporters of the Catholic King James II (Jacobites) and the Protestant King William of Orange (Williamites). The treaty offered toleration to Catholicism and full legal rights to Catholics that swore an oath of loyalty to William III and Mary II. The Treaty was of national significance as it ensured closer British and Protestant dominance over Ireland. The articles of the Treaty protecting Catholic rights were not passed by the Protestant Irish Parliament which rather updated the Penal Laws against Catholics which had major implications for Irish history. Reputedly the Treaty was signed on the Treaty Stone, an irregular block of limestone which once served as a mounting block for horses. This stone is now displayed on a pedestal at Clancy Strand. Because of the treaty, Limerick is sometimes known as the Treaty City. This turbulent period earned the city its motto: urbs antiqua fuit studisque asperrima belli (an ancient city well studied in the arts of war).\nThe peaceful times that followed the turmoil of the late 17th century allowed the city to prosper through trade in the late 18th century. During this time Limerick Port established itself as one of Ireland's major commercial ports exporting agricultural produce from one of Ireland's most fertile areas, the Golden Vale, to Britain and America. This increase in trade and wealth, particularly amongst the city's merchant classes saw a rapid expansion of the city as Georgian Limerick began to take shape. This gave the city its present-day look including the extensive terraced streets of Georgian townhouses which remain in the city centre today. The Waterford and Limerick Railway linked the city to the Dublin\u2013Cork railway line in 1848 and to Waterford in 1853. The opening of a number of secondary railways in the subsequent decades developed Limerick as a regional centre of communications.  However, the economic downturn in the European conflicts of the French Revolution and Napoleonic eras, and following the Act of Union 1800, and the impact of the Great Irish Famine of 1848 caused much of the 19th century to be a more troubled period.\n\n\n=== 20th-century history ===\n\nThe Limerick boycott was an economic boycott waged against the small Jewish community for over two years in the first decade of the 20th century. It was accompanied by a number of assaults, stone throwing and intimidation, which caused many Jews to leave the city. It was instigated in 1904 by a Redemptorist priest, Father John Creagh.\nDuring the Irish War of Independence, the Limerick Soviet was a self-declared soviet that existed from 15 to 27 April 1919. A general strike was organised by the Limerick Trades and Labour Council, as a protest against the British Army's declaration of a \"Special Military Area\" under the Defence of the Realm Act, which covered most of Limerick city and a part of the county. During the strike a special strike committee was set up to print their own money, control food prices and publish newspapers.\nBy the mid-20th century, Limerick was characterised by economic stagnation and decline as many traditional industries closed or left the city. However, there were some success stories. In 1942 Shannon Airport (located in County Clare, 20 km west of the city) opened for the first time offering transatlantic flights. In 1959, Shannon Airport enabled the opening of the Shannon Free Zone which attracted a large number of multinational companies to the region. A long campaign for a third level educational institute to be located in the city finally bore fruit with the establishment of NIHE Limerick in 1969 which eventually became the University of Limerick in 1989.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nThe local government area of Limerick city is under the jurisdiction of Limerick City and County Council. The Council has responsibility for local services such as sanitation, planning and development, libraries, collection of motor taxation, local roads and social housing in the city. The council comprises elected ward Councillors with an appointed full-time CEO as the city (and county) manager. Local elections are held every five years and the Councillors annually elect a Cathaoirleach or chairman to chair the council. As of 2015, the Cathaoirleach was Cllr Liam Galvin from the Newcastle West electoral area. The 21 Councillors from the 3 electoral districts in the City Metropolitan Area also elect a mayor to represent the city. The Mayoral position is largely ceremonial and has much reduced responsibility following the merger of the Limerick local authorities. Although the Mayor is the city's first citizen, within the council the position is below that of the Cathaoirleach. The current mayor is Councillor Jerry O'Dea. Former well-known mayors include TDs Donogh O'Malley, Stephen Coughlan, Michael Lipper, Jim Kemmy and Jan O'Sullivan.Throughout most of the city's history; from 1197 when it gained its first charter, Limerick City had its own local government authority, Limerick Corporation later known as Limerick City Council. The council was one of the oldest in Ireland and was only exceeded in age by Dublin City Council. In October 2012 the Government of Ireland published Putting People First- Action Programme for Effective Local Government which set out Government policy for reforms across all the main areas of local government in Ireland. Among the recommendations was the merging of Limerick City Council with Limerick County Council. The changes came into effect on 1 June 2014 following the implementation of the Local Government Reform Act 2014.By the 1960s onwards the city had outgrown its boundary considerably; the city boundary was only altered slightly and never reflected the overall urban area of the city. A limited boundary extension on the city's north side in 2008 enlarged the city boundary by 1,020 hectares increasing the city's area by almost 50% and raising the population by an estimated 7,000. The previous boundary, encompassing 2,086 hectares, was delineated in 1950. Newer suburban districts such as Dooradoyle, Castletroy \u2013 including the University, Gouldavoher, and Raheen were continually administered to by Limerick County Council until the merger of the two authorities in June 2014. This local government structure in Limerick caused a number of inefficiencies, most notably in the area of planning. A number of suburbs such as Westbury and Parteen to the north of the city are governed by Clare County Council.\nFollowing the merger of the two authorities in 2014 a new Metropolitan District of Limerick City was set up that included the city urban area and also settlements close to the city such as Patrickswell and Castleconnell. The Metropolitan district returns 21 Councillors to Limerick City and County Council which in total has 40 Councillors returned from across Limerick City and County. The Limerick City Metropolitan District is divided into 3 wards or electoral areas which are; Limerick City East, Limerick City North and Limerick City South which elect eight, six and seven Councillors respectively.Following the 2019 local elections, Fine Gael was the largest party on the united authority with 13 seats followed by Fianna F\u00e1il with 12, Labour with 3, Sinn F\u00e9in and the Green Party (Ireland) with 2 each, the Social Democrats with 1 seat, and Independents and other parties the remaining 6 seats.For national D\u00e1il elections Limerick City is in the Limerick City constituency. From 2011, the constituency boundaries changed in accordance with the proposals of the Constituency Commission and the subsequent Electoral (Amendment) Act 2009. This changed the electoral boundaries from Limerick East and Limerick West to Limerick City and Limerick. Limerick city encompasses the city, the suburban areas of Castletroy and as far east as Castleconnell. It also includes part of south County Clare. The Limerick county constituency takes in most of the rest of the county. For European parliament elections Limerick is in South Ireland.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nLimerick's climate is classified as temperate oceanic (K\u00f6ppen Cfb). Met \u00c9ireann maintains a climatological weather station at Shannon Airport, 20 kilometres west of the city in County Clare. Shannon Airport records an average of 977 millimetres of precipitation annually, most of which is rain. Limerick has a mild climate, with the average daily maximum in July of 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) and the average daily minimum in January of 3 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F). The highest temperature recorded was 32.0 \u00b0C (89.6 \u00b0F) in June 2018, and the lowest \u221211.4 \u00b0C (11.5 \u00b0F) in 2010. Limerick is the cloudiest city in the state, averaging only 1,295 sunshine hours annually, 3.5 hours of sunshine every day. There are on average 62 days of no recordable sunshine, 6 days of thunder, 22 days of hail and 11 days of snow per year. Shannon Airport is located by the ocean at an elevation of 14 metres, so snow is less common at the station than in the city itself.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn 2014, Limerick became Ireland's inaugural National City of Culture, with a variety of artistic and cultural events occurring at locations around the city throughout the year.\nThe Limerick City Gallery of Art on Pery Square is the city's chief venue for contemporary art exhibitions. It is home to a permanent collection of Irish art, which shows works from the early 18th to 20th century. The gallery houses the National Collection of Contemporary Drawing founded by the artist Samuel Walsh in 1987. Limerick's major contemporary art event is EVA International, Ireland's Biennial of Contemporary Art. EVA International, centered mainly in the Limerick City Gallery of Art, is curated by varying guest curators and includes contemporary artworks by both international and Irish artists.The Lime Tree Theatre officially opened at the Mary Immaculate College campus in October 2012. The venue hosts theatre, music, comedy, traditional arts, schools' performances and conferences.The Belltable Arts Centre on O'Connell Street hosts local playwrights and drama productions. The University Concert Hall located in UL is a 1,000 seat venue and provides a large venue for national and international acts to visit the city. Limerick is also the home of street theatre companies, including \"The Umbrella Project\".\nLimerick's literature scene is supported by projects like the Limerick Writers' Centre, which was established in 2008 and runs a range of writing activities in the city. Limerick natives include Pulitzer Prize winning author, Frank McCourt; novelists Kate O'Brien, Michael Curtin, Kevin Barry and Donal Ryan. Poets from Limerick include Michael Hogan, Desmond O'Grady, and John Liddy.Other Limerick arts groups include Contact Studios, which provides individual studio spaces for visual artists; the Daghdha Dance Company, a contemporary dance company that has adopted a renovated church in John's Square, adjacent to St John's Cathedral, as a performance space); the Fresh Film Festival, which is held each spring, and includes films made by young people (7\u201318 years); Impact Theatre Company; and Limerick Printmakers Studio and Gallery, which provides printmaking facilities, a venue for exhibitions and events and an education programme. The Limerick Youth Theatre provides young people with an opening into acting and production.The Irish Chamber Orchestra and the Irish World Music Centre are both based in the University of Limerick. The university has a thousand-seat state-of-the-art concert hall that hosts visiting performers. The city's music scene has produced bands such as The Cranberries, guitarist Noel Hogan's MonoBand, The Hitchers and others. Electronic musician Richard D. James, more commonly known as Aphex Twin, was born in Limerick in 1971. The Limerick Art Gallery and the Art College cater for painting, sculpture and performance art.\nLimerick is also home to comedians The Rubberbandits, D'Unbelievables (Pat Shortt and Jon Kenny) and Karl Spain. Dolan's Warehouse on the Dock Road is a venue specialising in live music, established in 1998. Baker Place was a nightclub that held mainly local underground nights until its closure in 2011. In 2020, it was announced that the Dromkeen-based Shiloh Trust was seeking planning permission to convert the former premises of Baker Place into a bible school. The Crush 87 nightclub (formerly known as Trinity Rooms until its closure in 2010), was relaunched in 2013.The city is the setting for Frank McCourt's memoir Angela's Ashes and the film adaptation. The Frank McCourt Museum situated in Frank's former school on Hartsonge Street opened in 2011 and contains artefacts from the book. Limerick has also been the setting or location for a number of other films, including the dramas The Real Thing (2002), Cowboys & Angels (2003) and Lost & Found (2015).Riverfest is a summer festival held annually in Limerick since 2004. The 2014 festival was held in May and had a record 80,000 visitors.\n\n\n== Humorous verse ==\nA limerick is a type of humorous verse of five lines with an AABBA rhyme scheme: the poem's connection with the city is obscure, but the name is generally taken to be a reference to Limerick city or County Limerick, sometimes particularly to the Maigue Poets, and may derive from an earlier form of nonsense verse parlour game that traditionally included a refrain that included \"Will [or won't] you come (up) to Limerick?\" The earliest known use of the name \"Limerick\" for this type poem is an 1880 reference, in a Saint John, New Brunswick newspaper, to an apparently well-known tune.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Broadcasting ===\nRT\u00c9 lyric fm, a state-run classical music radio station and part of RT\u00c9, broadcasts nationally from studios in the city centre on Cornmarket Square which opened in 1994. Limerick's local radio station is Live 95FM, broadcasting from 'Radio House', near the waterfront at Steamboat Quay. Spin South West, owned by Communicorp, broadcasts to Counties Kerry, Clare, Limerick, Tipperary and southwest Laois from its studios at Landmark Buildings in the Raheen Industrial Estate. Student radio station, Wired FM, broadcasts on 99.9FM from Mary Immaculate College. Wired FM also has studios in Limerick Institute of Technology. University Hospital Limerick has a radio station on 94.2FM, but this can be heard only in the hospital and surrounding area. West Limerick 102 is broadcast from Newcastle West. The national broadcaster, RT\u00c9, has radio and television studios in the city, which are periodically used to broadcast programming from Limerick.\n\n\n=== Print ===\nSeveral local newspapers are published in the city, including The Limerick Post and The Limerick Leader and magazines include the Limerick Event Guide, Business Limerick and Limerick Now.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\nLimerick city is approximately 25 km from Shannon Airport. Tourist attractions in the city centre include Limerick City Museum, King John's Castle (1210), St Mary's Cathedral (1168), the Hunt Museum, the University of Limerick, Georgian houses and gardens and the Treaty Stone.  There are several seasonal tours, including Angela's Ashes walking tour of Limerick City, historical walking tour, and boat tours along the River Shannon.\nThe city centre is divided between the traditional areas of \"English Town\" on the southern end of King's Island, which includes the King John's Castle; \"Irish Town\", which includes the older streets on the south bank; and the current economic centre further south, called \"Newtown Pery\". Newtown Pery was built in the late 18th century before the Act of Union and, unusually for an Irish city and unique in Limerick, is laid out on a grid plan. The Limerick City Museum (formerly aka the Jim Kemmy Municipal Museum), is located in Istabraq Hall, City Hall, Merchant's Quay. It contains displays on Limerick's history and manufactures.\n\nThe Georgian core of the city, with its Georgian architecture in the Newtown Pery, was developed from the mid 18th century. This core includes O'Connell Street (George Street before independence) from the Cecil Street intersection running to the south west end of the Crescent, and south-east to Pery Street including Glentworth Street and Barrington Street. Other buildings of architectural note in the city are St John's Cathedral, designed by the notable Victorian architect, Philip Charles Hardwick. St Mary's Cathedral, at over 800 years old, is one of the oldest in Ireland. St John's Cathedral, whilst more modern, has Ireland's tallest spire at 94 m (308 ft).\nThe Hunt Museum is based in the historic 18th-century former Custom House. The museum was established to house a collection of approximately 2000 works of art and antiquities formed by John and Gertrude Hunt during their lifetimes.\nThe main park in Limerick is the People's Park which was opened in 1877 in memory of Richard Russell, a prominent local business man. The park is dominated by the Thomas Spring Rice memorial (MP for the city 1820\u20131832) and has a large collection of mature deciduous and evergreen trees.\nLimerick city centre changed significantly with the construction of several modern high-rise buildings in the early 2000s, in particular as part of the regeneration of the former docks area along the Dock Road. The suburban areas, where the majority of the population now live, have grown out from the centre along the main roads to Ennis (North Circular and Ennis Road areas/Caherdavin), Dublin (Castletroy and the University) and Cork (Ballinacurra/Dooradoyle/Raheen). Suburban houses are generally two-floor semi-detached homes for single families. These were built from the 1950s onwards in large estates by government projects and commercial developments, although there are many examples of Edwardian and older 1930s suburban homes on the main suburban thoroughfares leading towards the city (North & South Circular, Ballinacurra Road, O'Connell Avenue).\n\nLimerick city's nightlife is supported by a number of nightclubs and pubs which offer music. For example, Dolan's Warehouse is a small music venue which hosts local, national and international folk, indie, jazz, rock and traditional Irish music acts.In County Limerick, Adare village and the Foynes Flying Boat Museum, approximately 35 km (22 miles/30 minutes) from Limerick City along the scenic coastal N69 route from Limerick to Tralee, are also attractions. Bunratty Castle in County Clare is another local attraction, and is situated 15.4 km north of the city. Limerick is known to be the antipodes to the Campbell Islands of New Zealand.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nLimerick is the third largest city in Ireland (after Dublin and Cork) with a population of 94,192 in the urban area and 104,952 in the metropolitan district, according to the 2016 CSO census. The past census reported a large population decline in central city areas due in part to the Limerick regeneration process where in these areas the largest reduction was reported nationally and also to outward migration following the collapse of the local and national economy from 2008 onwards. The population of the Limerick Larger Urban Zone as defined by the EU is 162,413. The ethnic diversity in Limerick's population, which includes a large immigrant community, saw rapid growth during the Celtic Tiger and the following decade. The Polish community is one of the largest demographic groups in the Municipal District, with approximately 4,000 living and working in the area. Ireland's first Polish bank opened in 2007. The African community has set up a number of churches, which are now part of the cultural makeup of the city.Limerick has a large stock of local authority housing. Prior to the merger of Limerick City and County Council 41% of all housing within the old Limerick City Council boundary was local authority, which was the highest in Ireland. This figure is however no longer accurate given the larger metropolitan district of the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nLimerick is in the region dubbed \"the Midwest\". Also known as the \"Shannon Region\", this is primarily an economic and social concept. The region encompasses County Limerick, County Clare, North County Tipperary, Northwest County Kerry and south County Offaly, with its focal point centred on Limerick and its environs within an 8-kilometre (5 mi) radius.\nThe area is the main economic region in Ireland outside Dublin and Cork. Its economic development has been driven in part by the University of Limerick, Limerick Institute of Technology, Shannon Airport in County Clare and Shannon Development (an economic development agency), whose precursor was SFADCO (Shannon Free Airport Development Company), an economic agency that provided tax incentives to companies locating in the area surrounding Shannon Airport. As of 2006 Shannon Development was mostly concerned with disposing of valuable industrial park properties. Limerick Chamber of Commerce, a representative body for businesses in the region, celebrated its bicentennial/bicentenary in 2015.\nHistorically Limerick was an agricultural commodity-driven economy, due to its position as the first major port along the River Shannon. By the middle of the 18th century, Limerick Port grew to become one of Ireland's principal commercial ports, exporting agricultural produce from the most fertile tracts in Ireland known as the Golden Vale as well as produce from the surrounding counties. The city was one of the main meat processing areas in Ireland, and industry included confectionery and flour production. The city was known for its bacon industry \u2013 however this went into decline in the mid-20th century. The fishing industry in Limerick, based on Clancy's Strand opposite King John's Castle and at Coonagh nearby, once employed hundreds of men. The boat most commonly used was the Gandelow which was also used as a small Lighter (barge) to ferry goods to and from larger ships in the port. In the 1920s the construction of a dam at Ardnacrusha severely impacted salmon breeding and that, and the introduction of quotas, had by the 1950s caused salmon fishing to diminish. By 2006, most fishermen had relinquished their drift net licences and the industry can now be said to be dormant.As with other cities in Ireland, a number of multinational companies are based in Limerick, and the city is a growing recipient of foreign direct investment. Dell had its main European Manufacturing Facility at the Raheen Business Park however in January 2009 Dell announced that it would close its Limerick computer manufacturing plant and move the production lines to Poland. The facility was the largest Dell manufacturing plant outside the United States and produced 30,000\u201360,000 units per day for export to the EMEA. Dell remains one of the largest employers in the mid-west with over 1,000 people employed in service and support. Analog Devices has its European manufacturing base in Raheen, 3 km south-west of the city centre. The site employs more than 1,000 people. Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Vistakon (the world's largest manufacturer of contact lenses) has a large facility in Castletroy in the National Technology Park and also employs close to 1,000 people. It is Vistakon's only production facility outside the United States and one of the largest contact-lens manufacturing plants in the world. Cook Medical, the world's largest privately owned Medical Devices company, employs over 800 people in Limerick at the National Technology Park.\nThe Post-2008 Irish economic downturn had a profound effect on Limerick. The announcement in 2009 that Dell was to move its manufacturing facility from Limerick to Poland devastated the local economy. 1,900 jobs were lost at Dell and it is believed that for every job that was lost at Dell at least another 4 to 5 were at risk. The closure of the Dell manufacturing facility amounted to 2% of Ireland's national GDP. The downturn in the construction industry also cost many jobs as did the stalled Limerick regeneration programme which promised investment in Limerick's deprived city areas. As of 2012 unemployment had become a major problem across the city with the unemployment rate in the city at 28.6% which was almost twice the national average.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nThe Crescent Shopping Centre is the largest shopping centre in Ireland, outside of Dublin, and the largest in the province of Munster. It is located in Dooradoyle about 3 km south of the city centre, and has over 90 shopping outlets along with restaurants and a 12-screen Omniplex Cinema. The city centre also has a large retail district which includes a mix of more traditional type of shops as well as some modern high street stores. Cruises Street is one of the main shopping streets. O'Connell Street, William Street, Bedford Row and Thomas Street) are also retail streets within the city. The city centre saw some works on remodelling in the early 21st century, with pedestrianisation works on Bedford Row, Thomas Street and parts of Catherine Street, as well as widening footpaths on William Street. These works have sought to address a reduction of footfall in the city centre (in turn influencing the closure of many city centre retail businesses) which occurred from the recession of 2008 onwards.\n\n\n==== Retail parks and shopping centres ====\n\nDuring the Celtic Tiger years a number of shopping centres and retail parks opened in suburban areas of Limerick. In addition to the Crescent Shopping Centre, which expanded in the early 2000s, the Jetland Shopping Centre opened in Caherdavin in 2005. The Childers Road Retail Park and the Parkway Shopping Centre in the east of the city also have a number of high street stores. Unfinished retail centres include the Coonagh Cross retail development and the Parkway Valley Shopping Centre on the Dublin Road. A proposed but unapproved retail development project, the Opera Centre, makes up part of the \"Limerick 2030\" scheme.\n\n\n==== The Milk Market ====\nThe Milk Market located at Cornmarket Row in the city centre sells locally produced foods and products and is governed by Limerick Market Trustees. In 2010 work was undertaken to redevelop the existing premises to an all-weather, all year round facility as it operated in an outdoor environment. The work involved constructing a large canopy over the existing market premises and was officially re-opened in June 2010. The Milk Market Project won the 2011 Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI) 'Peoples Choice Award'.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nIn 2013, a renewable energy strategy was launched for the region, and proposed a 20% reduction in CO2-emissions, while ensuring that short-term actions were beneficial to the long-term goal of 100% renewable energy. The strategy was completed by the Danish Aalborg University.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\nShannon Airport is 20 km west of the city in County Clare.

Kerry Airport is connected to Farranfore railway station, from Limerick railway station travel via Limerick Junction and Mallow.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nLocal public transport is provided by several companies. Bus \u00c9ireann, Ireland's state-owned bus company, operates a number of services subsidised by the National Transport Authority, while a number of provide operators also run commercial bus services in and around Limerick. An updated city bus network was introduced in Limerick City in December 2016, which introduced new routes. In May 2019, Bus \u00c9ireann further changed and improved the Limerick City timetable, including increased frequency and later operating times.\nOther rural buses run to towns and villages in the county and to Shannon Airport. There are also a number of Intercity and international buses from Bus \u00c9ireann's bus terminal adjoining Limerick Colbert railway station. These include hourly services to Dublin, Cork, Ennis and Galway. Bus \u00c9ireann have also commenced a Limerick to Galway Express service travelling on the M18 in addition to the regular service.

Limerick railway station opened on 28 August 1858, replacing an earlier, temporary station 500 m east, which had operated from 9 May 1848.The following inter city routes are available from Limerick Colbert station :\n\nLimerick to Dublin Heuston: 16 services daily including 4 direct services. All remaining Dublin \u2013 Limerick services require passengers to change to the Dublin to Cork train at either Limerick Junction or at Ballybrophy railway station.\nLimerick to Waterford: 2 services daily (but none on Sundays).

Due to speed restrictions this alternative Dublin \u2013 Limerick route can take 60 minutes longer (with a change at Ballybrophy) than by Limerick Junction albeit a more direct service.\nLimerick \u2013 Limerick Junction and ThurlesThere are also a number of disused railway lines including the Limerick to Foynes line which closed to freight in the early 2000s, having lost passenger services in the early 1960s, although the track is still in situ.  This is the last remaining part of the North Kerry Line which closed to passenger traffic in the early 1960s and to freight traffic (other than Limerick \u2013 Foynes) in the mid-1970s, and has been lifted between Ballingrane (near Rathkeale) and Tralee.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nLimerick's central location in the mid\u2013west of Ireland means many national primary routes converge on the city. The M7 (Dublin), N/M18 (Galway, Ennis, Shannon), N/M20 (Cork), N21 (Tralee) and N24 (Waterford) routes all start/terminate in or near the city. Road infrastructure is further supplemented by the southern ring road and Limerick Tunnel bypass of the city and the M20 bypass of Dooradoyle and Raheen to the south of the city. Connections to the other cities were improved with the completion of the M7 motorway in December 2010, and continuing upgrades ongoing to the N/M18 to Shannon, Ennis, Galway and Tuam \u2013 the final section opened in September 2017. A motorway is also planned between Cork and Limerick, with a proposed completion date in the mid 2020s.\n\n\n=== Waterway transport ===\nHistorically, waterway transport has been key to Limerick's development. Vikings established the city as a maritime trading port. The city's position on a major Irish river system, the Shannon, enabled transport to the midlands of Ireland and further north and west. By the 18th century with the opening of canal systems throughout Ireland, Limerick Port established itself as Ireland's premier commercial port on the western side of the country. This was enabled by ease of access from the facilitated by the opening of canals but most importantly to the River Shannon. The opening of the Grand Canal in the 18th century provided further access to Dublin and the east of the country. There are also a number of disused canals in the vicinity of the city including the Park Canal & the Passey \u2013 Errina Canal on the old Limerick navigation. Waterway transport on the Shannon was regularly used to transport goods from Limerick to Dublin and vice versa however this mode of transport fell into decline in the 20th century. Originally Limerick port was located near the confluence of the Abbey and Shannon rivers at King's Island. Today the Shannon Foynes Port is located further downstream on the Shannon alongside the Dock Road. This general purpose facility port is operated by the Shannon Foynes Port Company who operate all marine activities in the Shannon estuary.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nLimerick is a centre of higher education in the region, and technical and continuation education within the city traces its beginning back to the formation of the Limerick Athenaeum Society in 1852, marking the foundation of the Limerick Institute of Technology.

        "wiki": "Limerick (; Irish: Luimneach [\u02c8l\u032a\u02e0\u026am\u02b2(\u0259)n\u02b2\u0259x]) is a city in County Limerick, Ireland. It is located in the Mid-West Region and is also part of the province of Munster. With a population of 94,192 at the 2016 census, Limerick is the third-most populous urban area in the state, and the fourth-most populous city on the island of Ireland. The city lies on the River Shannon, with the historic core of the city located on King's Island, which is bounded by the Shannon and Abbey Rivers. Limerick is also located at the head of the Shannon Estuary, where the river widens before it flows into the Atlantic Ocean. Limerick City and County Council is the local authority for the city.\n\n\n== Geography and political subdivisions ==\nAt the 2016 census, the Metropolitan District of Limerick had a population of 104,952. On 1 June 2014 following the merger of Limerick City and County Council, a new Metropolitan District of Limerick was formed within the united council, which extended the city area. The Metropolitan District includes the city urban area and extends outwards towards Patrickswell in the west and Castleconnell in the east. The City Metropolitan Area however excludes city suburbs located within County Clare.\nLimerick is one of the constituent cities of the Cork\u2013Limerick\u2013Galway corridor, which has a population of 1 million people. It is located at a strategic position on the River Shannon with four main crossing points near the city centre. To the south of the city is the Golden Vale, an area of rich pastureland. Historically, much of the city's industry was based on this rich agricultural hinterland, and it is particularly noted for Limerick ham.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient and medieval history ===\nLuimneach originally referred to the general area along the banks of the Shannon Estuary known as Loch Luimnigh. The earliest settlement in the city, Inis Sibhtonn, was the original name for King's Island during the pre-Viking and Viking eras. This island was also called Inis an Ghaill Duibh, 'The Dark-(haired) Foreigner's Island'. The name is recorded in Viking sources as Hlymrekr.\nThe city dates from 812; however, history suggests the presence of earlier settlements in the area surrounding King's Island, the island at the historical city centre. Antiquity's map-maker, Ptolemy, produced in 150 the earliest map of Ireland, showing a place called Regia at the same site as King's Island. History also records an important battle involving Cormac mac Airt in 221 and a visit by Saint Patrick in 434 to baptise an E\u00f3ganachta king, Carthann the Fair. Saint Munchin, the first bishop of Limerick died in 652, indicating the city was a place of some note. In 812 the Vikings sailed up the Shannon and pillaged the city, burned the monastery of Mungret but were forced to flee when the Irish attacked and killed many of their number. The Normans redesigned the city in the 12th century and added much of the most notable architecture, such as King John's Castle and St Mary's Cathedral.In early medieval times Limerick was at the centre of the Kingdom of Thomond which corresponds to the present day County Clare, the Kingdom also included North Kerry and parts of South Offaly. One of the kingdom's most notable kings was Brian Boru, ancestor of the O'Brien Clan of Dalcassians. The word Thomond is synonymous with the region and is retained in place names such as Thomondgate, Thomond Bridge and Thomond Park.\n\n\n=== Late Renaissance/Early modern history ===\n\nLimerick in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was often called the most beautiful city in Ireland. The English-born judge Luke Gernon, a resident of Limerick, wrote in 1620 that at his first sight of the city he had been amazed at its magnificence: \"lofty buildings of marble, like the Colleges in Oxford\".During the civil wars of the 17th century the city played a pivotal role, besieged by Oliver Cromwell in 1651 and twice by the Williamites in the 1690s. The Treaty of Limerick ended the Williamite war in Ireland which was fought between supporters of the Catholic King James II (Jacobites) and the Protestant King William of Orange (Williamites). The treaty offered toleration to Catholicism and full legal rights to Catholics that swore an oath of loyalty to William III and Mary II. The Treaty was of national significance as it ensured closer British and Protestant dominance over Ireland. The articles of the Treaty protecting Catholic rights were not passed by the Protestant Irish Parliament which rather updated the Penal Laws against Catholics which had major implications for Irish history. Reputedly the Treaty was signed on the Treaty Stone, an irregular block of limestone which once served as a mounting block for horses. This stone is now displayed on a pedestal at Clancy Strand. Because of the treaty, Limerick is sometimes known as the Treaty City. This turbulent period earned the city its motto: urbs antiqua fuit studisque asperrima belli (an ancient city well studied in the arts of war).\nThe peaceful times that followed the turmoil of the late 17th century allowed the city to prosper through trade in the late 18th century. During this time Limerick Port established itself as one of Ireland's major commercial ports exporting agricultural produce from one of Ireland's most fertile areas, the Golden Vale, to Britain and America. This increase in trade and wealth, particularly amongst the city's merchant classes saw a rapid expansion of the city as Georgian Limerick began to take shape. This gave the city its present-day look including the extensive terraced streets of Georgian townhouses which remain in the city centre today. The Waterford and Limerick Railway linked the city to the Dublin\u2013Cork railway line in 1848 and to Waterford in 1853. The opening of a number of secondary railways in the subsequent decades developed Limerick as a regional centre of communications.  However, the economic downturn in the European conflicts of the French Revolution and Napoleonic eras, and following the Act of Union 1800, and the impact of the Great Irish Famine of 1848 caused much of the 19th century to be a more troubled period.\n\n\n=== 20th-century history ===\n\nThe Limerick boycott was an economic boycott waged against the small Jewish community for over two years in the first decade of the 20th century. It was accompanied by a number of assaults, stone throwing and intimidation, which caused many Jews to leave the city. It was instigated in 1904 by a Redemptorist priest, Father John Creagh.\nDuring the Irish War of Independence, the Limerick Soviet was a self-declared soviet that existed from 15 to 27 April 1919. A general strike was organised by the Limerick Trades and Labour Council, as a protest against the British Army's declaration of a \"Special Military Area\" under the Defence of the Realm Act, which covered most of Limerick city and a part of the county. During the strike a special strike committee was set up to print their own money, control food prices and publish newspapers.\nBy the mid-20th century, Limerick was characterised by economic stagnation and decline as many traditional industries closed or left the city. However, there were some success stories. In 1942 Shannon Airport (located in County Clare, 20 km west of the city) opened for the first time offering transatlantic flights. In 1959, Shannon Airport enabled the opening of the Shannon Free Zone which attracted a large number of multinational companies to the region. A long campaign for a third level educational institute to be located in the city finally bore fruit with the establishment of NIHE Limerick in 1969 which eventually became the University of Limerick in 1989.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nThe local government area of Limerick city is under the jurisdiction of Limerick City and County Council. The Council has responsibility for local services such as sanitation, planning and development, libraries, collection of motor taxation, local roads and social housing in the city. The council comprises elected ward Councillors with an appointed full-time CEO as the city (and county) manager. Local elections are held every five years and the Councillors annually elect a Cathaoirleach or chairman to chair the council. As of 2015, the Cathaoirleach was Cllr Liam Galvin from the Newcastle West electoral area. The 21 Councillors from the 3 electoral districts in the City Metropolitan Area also elect a mayor to represent the city. The Mayoral position is largely ceremonial and has much reduced responsibility following the merger of the Limerick local authorities. Although the Mayor is the city's first citizen, within the council the position is below that of the Cathaoirleach. The current mayor is Councillor Jerry O'Dea. Former well-known mayors include TDs Donogh O'Malley, Stephen Coughlan, Michael Lipper, Jim Kemmy and Jan O'Sullivan.Throughout most of the city's history; from 1197 when it gained its first charter, Limerick City had its own local government authority, Limerick Corporation later known as Limerick City Council. The council was one of the oldest in Ireland and was only exceeded in age by Dublin City Council. In October 2012 the Government of Ireland published Putting People First- Action Programme for Effective Local Government which set out Government policy for reforms across all the main areas of local government in Ireland. Among the recommendations was the merging of Limerick City Council with Limerick County Council. The changes came into effect on 1 June 2014 following the implementation of the Local Government Reform Act 2014.By the 1960s onwards the city had outgrown its boundary considerably; the city boundary was only altered slightly and never reflected the overall urban area of the city. A limited boundary extension on the city's north side in 2008 enlarged the city boundary by 1,020 hectares increasing the city's area by almost 50% and raising the population by an estimated 7,000. The previous boundary, encompassing 2,086 hectares, was delineated in 1950. Newer suburban districts such as Dooradoyle, Castletroy \u2013 including the University, Gouldavoher, and Raheen were continually administered to by Limerick County Council until the merger of the two authorities in June 2014. This local government structure in Limerick caused a number of inefficiencies, most notably in the area of planning. A number of suburbs such as Westbury and Parteen to the north of the city are governed by Clare County Council.\nFollowing the merger of the two authorities in 2014 a new Metropolitan District of Limerick City was set up that included the city urban area and also settlements close to the city such as Patrickswell and Castleconnell. The Metropolitan district returns 21 Councillors to Limerick City and County Council which in total has 40 Councillors returned from across Limerick City and County. The Limerick City Metropolitan District is divided into 3 wards or electoral areas which are; Limerick City East, Limerick City North and Limerick City South which elect eight, six and seven Councillors respectively.Following the 2019 local elections, Fine Gael was the largest party on the united authority with 13 seats followed by Fianna F\u00e1il with 12, Labour with 3, Sinn F\u00e9in and the Green Party (Ireland) with 2 each, the Social Democrats with 1 seat, and Independents and other parties the remaining 6 seats.For national D\u00e1il elections Limerick City is in the Limerick City constituency. From 2011, the constituency boundaries changed in accordance with the proposals of the Constituency Commission and the subsequent Electoral (Amendment) Act 2009. This changed the electoral boundaries from Limerick East and Limerick West to Limerick City and Limerick. Limerick city encompasses the city, the suburban areas of Castletroy and as far east as Castleconnell. It also includes part of south County Clare. The Limerick county constituency takes in most of the rest of the county. For European parliament elections Limerick is in South Ireland.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nLimerick's climate is classified as temperate oceanic (K\u00f6ppen Cfb). Met \u00c9ireann maintains a climatological weather station at Shannon Airport, 20 kilometres west of the city in County Clare. Shannon Airport records an average of 977 millimetres of precipitation annually, most of which is rain. Limerick has a mild climate, with the average daily maximum in July of 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) and the average daily minimum in January of 3 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F). The highest temperature recorded was 32.0 \u00b0C (89.6 \u00b0F) in June 2018, and the lowest \u221211.4 \u00b0C (11.5 \u00b0F) in 2010. Limerick is the cloudiest city in the state, averaging only 1,295 sunshine hours annually, 3.5 hours of sunshine every day. There are on average 62 days of no recordable sunshine, 6 days of thunder, 22 days of hail and 11 days of snow per year. Shannon Airport is located by the ocean at an elevation of 14 metres, so snow is less common at the station than in the city itself.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn 2014, Limerick became Ireland's inaugural National City of Culture, with a variety of artistic and cultural events occurring at locations around the city throughout the year.\nThe Limerick City Gallery of Art on Pery Square is the city's chief venue for contemporary art exhibitions. It is home to a permanent collection of Irish art, which shows works from the early 18th to 20th century. The gallery houses the National Collection of Contemporary Drawing founded by the artist Samuel Walsh in 1987. Limerick's major contemporary art event is EVA International, Ireland's Biennial of Contemporary Art. EVA International, centered mainly in the Limerick City Gallery of Art, is curated by varying guest curators and includes contemporary artworks by both international and Irish artists.The Lime Tree Theatre officially opened at the Mary Immaculate College campus in October 2012. The venue hosts theatre, music, comedy, traditional arts, schools' performances and conferences.The Belltable Arts Centre on O'Connell Street hosts local playwrights and drama productions. The University Concert Hall located in UL is a 1,000 seat venue and provides a large venue for national and international acts to visit the city. Limerick is also the home of street theatre companies, including \"The Umbrella Project\".\nLimerick's literature scene is supported by projects like the Limerick Writers' Centre, which was established in 2008 and runs a range of writing activities in the city. Limerick natives include Pulitzer Prize winning author, Frank McCourt; novelists Kate O'Brien, Michael Curtin, Kevin Barry and Donal Ryan. Poets from Limerick include Michael Hogan, Desmond O'Grady, and John Liddy.Other Limerick arts groups include Contact Studios, which provides individual studio spaces for visual artists; the Daghdha Dance Company, a contemporary dance company that has adopted a renovated church in John's Square, adjacent to St John's Cathedral, as a performance space); the Fresh Film Festival, which is held each spring, and includes films made by young people (7\u201318 years); Impact Theatre Company; and Limerick Printmakers Studio and Gallery, which provides printmaking facilities, a venue for exhibitions and events and an education programme. The Limerick Youth Theatre provides young people with an opening into acting and production.The Irish Chamber Orchestra and the Irish World Music Centre are both based in the University of Limerick. The university has a thousand-seat state-of-the-art concert hall that hosts visiting performers. The city's music scene has produced bands such as The Cranberries, guitarist Noel Hogan's MonoBand, The Hitchers and others. Electronic musician Richard D. James, more commonly known as Aphex Twin, was born in Limerick in 1971. The Limerick Art Gallery and the Art College cater for painting, sculpture and performance art.\nLimerick is also home to comedians The Rubberbandits, D'Unbelievables (Pat Shortt and Jon Kenny) and Karl Spain. Dolan's Warehouse on the Dock Road is a venue specialising in live music, established in 1998. Baker Place was a nightclub that held mainly local underground nights until its closure in 2011. In 2020, it was announced that the Dromkeen-based Shiloh Trust was seeking planning permission to convert the former premises of Baker Place into a bible school. The Crush 87 nightclub (formerly known as Trinity Rooms until its closure in 2010), was relaunched in 2013.The city is the setting for Frank McCourt's memoir Angela's Ashes and the film adaptation. The Frank McCourt Museum situated in Frank's former school on Hartsonge Street opened in 2011 and contains artefacts from the book. Limerick has also been the setting or location for a number of other films, including the dramas The Real Thing (2002), Cowboys & Angels (2003) and Lost & Found (2015).Riverfest is a summer festival held annually in Limerick since 2004. The 2014 festival was held in May and had a record 80,000 visitors.\n\n\n== Humorous verse ==\nA limerick is a type of humorous verse of five lines with an AABBA rhyme scheme: the poem's connection with the city is obscure, but the name is generally taken to be a reference to Limerick city or County Limerick, sometimes particularly to the Maigue Poets, and may derive from an earlier form of nonsense verse parlour game that traditionally included a refrain that included \"Will [or won't] you come (up) to Limerick?\" The earliest known use of the name \"Limerick\" for this type poem is an 1880 reference, in a Saint John, New Brunswick newspaper, to an apparently well-known tune.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Broadcasting ===\nRT\u00c9 lyric fm, a state-run classical music radio station and part of RT\u00c9, broadcasts nationally from studios in the city centre on Cornmarket Square which opened in 1994. Limerick's local radio station is Live 95FM, broadcasting from 'Radio House', near the waterfront at Steamboat Quay. Spin South West, owned by Communicorp, broadcasts to Counties Kerry, Clare, Limerick, Tipperary and southwest Laois from its studios at Landmark Buildings in the Raheen Industrial Estate. Student radio station, Wired FM, broadcasts on 99.9FM from Mary Immaculate College. Wired FM also has studios in Limerick Institute of Technology. University Hospital Limerick has a radio station on 94.2FM, but this can be heard only in the hospital and surrounding area. West Limerick 102 is broadcast from Newcastle West. The national broadcaster, RT\u00c9, has radio and television studios in the city, which are periodically used to broadcast programming from Limerick.\n\n\n=== Print ===\nSeveral local newspapers are published in the city, including The Limerick Post and The Limerick Leader and magazines include the Limerick Event Guide, Business Limerick and Limerick Now.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\nLimerick city is approximately 25 km from Shannon Airport. Tourist attractions in the city centre include Limerick City Museum, King John's Castle (1210), St Mary's Cathedral (1168), the Hunt Museum, the University of Limerick, Georgian houses and gardens and the Treaty Stone.  There are several seasonal tours, including Angela's Ashes walking tour of Limerick City, historical walking tour, and boat tours along the River Shannon.\nThe city centre is divided between the traditional areas of \"English Town\" on the southern end of King's Island, which includes the King John's Castle; \"Irish Town\", which includes the older streets on the south bank; and the current economic centre further south, called \"Newtown Pery\". Newtown Pery was built in the late 18th century before the Act of Union and, unusually for an Irish city and unique in Limerick, is laid out on a grid plan. The Limerick City Museum (formerly aka the Jim Kemmy Municipal Museum), is located in Istabraq Hall, City Hall, Merchant's Quay. It contains displays on Limerick's history and manufactures.\n\nThe Georgian core of the city, with its Georgian architecture in the Newtown Pery, was developed from the mid 18th century. This core includes O'Connell Street (George Street before independence) from the Cecil Street intersection running to the south west end of the Crescent, and south-east to Pery Street including Glentworth Street and Barrington Street. Other buildings of architectural note in the city are St John's Cathedral, designed by the notable Victorian architect, Philip Charles Hardwick. St Mary's Cathedral, at over 800 years old, is one of the oldest in Ireland. St John's Cathedral, whilst more modern, has Ireland's tallest spire at 94 m (308 ft).\nThe Hunt Museum is based in the historic 18th-century former Custom House. The museum was established to house a collection of approximately 2000 works of art and antiquities formed by John and Gertrude Hunt during their lifetimes.\nThe main park in Limerick is the People's Park which was opened in 1877 in memory of Richard Russell, a prominent local business man. The park is dominated by the Thomas Spring Rice memorial (MP for the city 1820\u20131832) and has a large collection of mature deciduous and evergreen trees.\nLimerick city centre changed significantly with the construction of several modern high-rise buildings in the early 2000s, in particular as part of the regeneration of the former docks area along the Dock Road. The suburban areas, where the majority of the population now live, have grown out from the centre along the main roads to Ennis (North Circular and Ennis Road areas/Caherdavin), Dublin (Castletroy and the University) and Cork (Ballinacurra/Dooradoyle/Raheen). Suburban houses are generally two-floor semi-detached homes for single families. These were built from the 1950s onwards in large estates by government projects and commercial developments, although there are many examples of Edwardian and older 1930s suburban homes on the main suburban thoroughfares leading towards the city (North & South Circular, Ballinacurra Road, O'Connell Avenue).\n\nLimerick city's nightlife is supported by a number of nightclubs and pubs which offer music. For example, Dolan's Warehouse is a small music venue which hosts local, national and international folk, indie, jazz, rock and traditional Irish music acts.In County Limerick, Adare village and the Foynes Flying Boat Museum, approximately 35 km (22 miles/30 minutes) from Limerick City along the scenic coastal N69 route from Limerick to Tralee, are also attractions. Bunratty Castle in County Clare is another local attraction, and is situated 15.4 km north of the city. Limerick is known to be the antipodes to the Campbell Islands of New Zealand.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nLimerick is the third largest city in Ireland (after Dublin and Cork) with a population of 94,192 in the urban area and 104,952 in the metropolitan district, according to the 2016 CSO census. The past census reported a large population decline in central city areas due in part to the Limerick regeneration process where in these areas the largest reduction was reported nationally and also to outward migration following the collapse of the local and national economy from 2008 onwards. The population of the Limerick Larger Urban Zone as defined by the EU is 162,413. The ethnic diversity in Limerick's population, which includes a large immigrant community, saw rapid growth during the Celtic Tiger and the following decade. The Polish community is one of the largest demographic groups in the Municipal District, with approximately 4,000 living and working in the area. Ireland's first Polish bank opened in 2007. The African community has set up a number of churches, which are now part of the cultural makeup of the city.Limerick has a large stock of local authority housing. Prior to the merger of Limerick City and County Council 41% of all housing within the old Limerick City Council boundary was local authority, which was the highest in Ireland. This figure is however no longer accurate given the larger metropolitan district of the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nLimerick is in the region dubbed \"the Midwest\". Also known as the \"Shannon Region\", this is primarily an economic and social concept. The region encompasses County Limerick, County Clare, North County Tipperary, Northwest County Kerry and south County Offaly, with its focal point centred on Limerick and its environs within an 8-kilometre (5 mi) radius.\nThe area is the main economic region in Ireland outside Dublin and Cork. Its economic development has been driven in part by the University of Limerick, Limerick Institute of Technology, Shannon Airport in County Clare and Shannon Development (an economic development agency), whose precursor was SFADCO (Shannon Free Airport Development Company), an economic agency that provided tax incentives to companies locating in the area surrounding Shannon Airport. As of 2006 Shannon Development was mostly concerned with disposing of valuable industrial park properties. Limerick Chamber of Commerce, a representative body for businesses in the region, celebrated its bicentennial/bicentenary in 2015.\nHistorically Limerick was an agricultural commodity-driven economy, due to its position as the first major port along the River Shannon. By the middle of the 18th century, Limerick Port grew to become one of Ireland's principal commercial ports, exporting agricultural produce from the most fertile tracts in Ireland known as the Golden Vale as well as produce from the surrounding counties. The city was one of the main meat processing areas in Ireland, and industry included confectionery and flour production. The city was known for its bacon industry \u2013 however this went into decline in the mid-20th century. The fishing industry in Limerick, based on Clancy's Strand opposite King John's Castle and at Coonagh nearby, once employed hundreds of men. The boat most commonly used was the Gandelow which was also used as a small Lighter (barge) to ferry goods to and from larger ships in the port. In the 1920s the construction of a dam at Ardnacrusha severely impacted salmon breeding and that, and the introduction of quotas, had by the 1950s caused salmon fishing to diminish. By 2006, most fishermen had relinquished their drift net licences and the industry can now be said to be dormant.As with other cities in Ireland, a number of multinational companies are based in Limerick, and the city is a growing recipient of foreign direct investment. Dell had its main European Manufacturing Facility at the Raheen Business Park however in January 2009 Dell announced that it would close its Limerick computer manufacturing plant and move the production lines to Poland. The facility was the largest Dell manufacturing plant outside the United States and produced 30,000\u201360,000 units per day for export to the EMEA. Dell remains one of the largest employers in the mid-west with over 1,000 people employed in service and support. Analog Devices has its European manufacturing base in Raheen, 3 km south-west of the city centre. The site employs more than 1,000 people. Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Vistakon (the world's largest manufacturer of contact lenses) has a large facility in Castletroy in the National Technology Park and also employs close to 1,000 people. It is Vistakon's only production facility outside the United States and one of the largest contact-lens manufacturing plants in the world. Cook Medical, the world's largest privately owned Medical Devices company, employs over 800 people in Limerick at the National Technology Park.\nThe Post-2008 Irish economic downturn had a profound effect on Limerick. The announcement in 2009 that Dell was to move its manufacturing facility from Limerick to Poland devastated the local economy. 1,900 jobs were lost at Dell and it is believed that for every job that was lost at Dell at least another 4 to 5 were at risk. The closure of the Dell manufacturing facility amounted to 2% of Ireland's national GDP. The downturn in the construction industry also cost many jobs as did the stalled Limerick regeneration programme which promised investment in Limerick's deprived city areas. As of 2012 unemployment had become a major problem across the city with the unemployment rate in the city at 28.6% which was almost twice the national average.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nThe Crescent Shopping Centre is the largest shopping centre in Ireland, outside of Dublin, and the largest in the province of Munster. It is located in Dooradoyle about 3 km south of the city centre, and has over 90 shopping outlets along with restaurants and a 12-screen Omniplex Cinema. The city centre also has a large retail district which includes a mix of more traditional type of shops as well as some modern high street stores. Cruises Street is one of the main shopping streets. O'Connell Street, William Street, Bedford Row and Thomas Street) are also retail streets within the city. The city centre saw some works on remodelling in the early 21st century, with pedestrianisation works on Bedford Row, Thomas Street and parts of Catherine Street, as well as widening footpaths on William Street. These works have sought to address a reduction of footfall in the city centre (in turn influencing the closure of many city centre retail businesses) which occurred from the recession of 2008 onwards.\n\n\n==== Retail parks and shopping centres ====\n\nDuring the Celtic Tiger years a number of shopping centres and retail parks opened in suburban areas of Limerick. In addition to the Crescent Shopping Centre, which expanded in the early 2000s, the Jetland Shopping Centre opened in Caherdavin in 2005. The Childers Road Retail Park and the Parkway Shopping Centre in the east of the city also have a number of high street stores. Unfinished retail centres include the Coonagh Cross retail development and the Parkway Valley Shopping Centre on the Dublin Road. A proposed but unapproved retail development project, the Opera Centre, makes up part of the \"Limerick 2030\" scheme.\n\n\n==== The Milk Market ====\nThe Milk Market located at Cornmarket Row in the city centre sells locally produced foods and products and is governed by Limerick Market Trustees. In 2010 work was undertaken to redevelop the existing premises to an all-weather, all year round facility as it operated in an outdoor environment. The work involved constructing a large canopy over the existing market premises and was officially re-opened in June 2010. The Milk Market Project won the 2011 Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI) 'Peoples Choice Award'.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nIn 2013, a renewable energy strategy was launched for the region, and proposed a 20% reduction in CO2-emissions, while ensuring that short-term actions were beneficial to the long-term goal of 100% renewable energy. The strategy was completed by the Danish Aalborg University.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\nShannon Airport is 20 km west of the city in County Clare. It is one of Ireland's main airports and is easily accessible from Limerick via the N18 dual carriageway and from other regions via the Limerick Tunnel. It has scheduled flights to European and North American destinations. Airlines using the airport include Ryanair, Aer Lingus, United Airlines, American Airlines, Aer Lingus Regional and Delta Air Lines. There is no rail link to the airport. Coonagh airfield, a few kilometres west of Caherdavin, serves small private aircraft. Kerry and Cork Airports are around 1 hour 30 minutes and 2 hours drive away, respectively. Kerry Airport is connected to Farranfore railway station, from Limerick railway station travel via Limerick Junction and Mallow.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nLocal public transport is provided by several companies. Bus \u00c9ireann, Ireland's state-owned bus company, operates a number of services subsidised by the National Transport Authority, while a number of provide operators also run commercial bus services in and around Limerick. An updated city bus network was introduced in Limerick City in December 2016, which introduced new routes. In May 2019, Bus \u00c9ireann further changed and improved the Limerick City timetable, including increased frequency and later operating times.\nOther rural buses run to towns and villages in the county and to Shannon Airport. There are also a number of Intercity and international buses from Bus \u00c9ireann's bus terminal adjoining Limerick Colbert railway station. These include hourly services to Dublin, Cork, Ennis and Galway. Bus \u00c9ireann have also commenced a Limerick to Galway Express service travelling on the M18 in addition to the regular service. Buses run every 2 hours to Tralee and Killarney. There are also regular daily services to Waterford and Athlone, and a daily service to London via the ferry from Rosslare Europort.\nThere are a number of private bus companies in operation providing city and intercity services. Dublin Coach provide the M7 express service which operates every hour from Arthur's Quay which goes to Dublin or Ennis. JJ Kavanagh also provide Dublin to Limerick services from Arthur's Quay. Citylink run a number of services from Limerick to Galway and Cork and operate from Henry Street.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nIarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann's Limerick Colbert station is the railway hub for the city and the Mid West Region with a number of intercity and commuter rail services. Limerick railway station opened on 28 August 1858, replacing an earlier, temporary station 500 m east, which had operated from 9 May 1848.The following inter city routes are available from Limerick Colbert station :\n\nLimerick to Dublin Heuston: 16 services daily including 4 direct services. All remaining Dublin \u2013 Limerick services require passengers to change to the Dublin to Cork train at either Limerick Junction or at Ballybrophy railway station.\nLimerick to Waterford: 2 services daily (but none on Sundays). Passengers must change train at Limerick Junction to continue to Waterford with stations at Tipperary, Cahir, Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir.\nLimerick to Galway: 5 services daily. This service reopened on 29 March 2010.\nLimerick to Cork: Passengers can travel between Limerick and Cork via Limerick Junction. There is no direct service.\nLimerick to Killarney, Farranfore and Tralee: Passengers can travel between Limerick and Killarney, Farranfore and Tralee via Limerick Junction where trains run via Mallow to reach County Kerry.There are 3 suburban/commuter services in the Limerick Suburban Rail network:\n\nLimerick \u2013 Ennis calling at Sixmilebridge\nLimerick \u2013 Nenagh calling at Castleconnell and Birdhill (with some services continuing to Cloughjordan & Roscrea & connecting to the Dublin-Cork railway line at Ballybrophy.) Due to speed restrictions this alternative Dublin \u2013 Limerick route can take 60 minutes longer (with a change at Ballybrophy) than by Limerick Junction albeit a more direct service.\nLimerick \u2013 Limerick Junction and ThurlesThere are also a number of disused railway lines including the Limerick to Foynes line which closed to freight in the early 2000s, having lost passenger services in the early 1960s, although the track is still in situ.  This is the last remaining part of the North Kerry Line which closed to passenger traffic in the early 1960s and to freight traffic (other than Limerick \u2013 Foynes) in the mid-1970s, and has been lifted between Ballingrane (near Rathkeale) and Tralee.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nLimerick's central location in the mid\u2013west of Ireland means many national primary routes converge on the city. The M7 (Dublin), N/M18 (Galway, Ennis, Shannon), N/M20 (Cork), N21 (Tralee) and N24 (Waterford) routes all start/terminate in or near the city. Road infrastructure is further supplemented by the southern ring road and Limerick Tunnel bypass of the city and the M20 bypass of Dooradoyle and Raheen to the south of the city. Connections to the other cities were improved with the completion of the M7 motorway in December 2010, and continuing upgrades ongoing to the N/M18 to Shannon, Ennis, Galway and Tuam \u2013 the final section opened in September 2017. A motorway is also planned between Cork and Limerick, with a proposed completion date in the mid 2020s.\n\n\n=== Waterway transport ===\nHistorically, waterway transport has been key to Limerick's development. Vikings established the city as a maritime trading port. The city's position on a major Irish river system, the Shannon, enabled transport to the midlands of Ireland and further north and west. By the 18th century with the opening of canal systems throughout Ireland, Limerick Port established itself as Ireland's premier commercial port on the western side of the country. This was enabled by ease of access from the facilitated by the opening of canals but most importantly to the River Shannon. The opening of the Grand Canal in the 18th century provided further access to Dublin and the east of the country. There are also a number of disused canals in the vicinity of the city including the Park Canal & the Passey \u2013 Errina Canal on the old Limerick navigation. Waterway transport on the Shannon was regularly used to transport goods from Limerick to Dublin and vice versa however this mode of transport fell into decline in the 20th century. Originally Limerick port was located near the confluence of the Abbey and Shannon rivers at King's Island. Today the Shannon Foynes Port is located further downstream on the Shannon alongside the Dock Road. This general purpose facility port is operated by the Shannon Foynes Port Company who operate all marine activities in the Shannon estuary.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nLimerick is a centre of higher education in the region, and technical and continuation education within the city traces its beginning back to the formation of the Limerick Athenaeum Society in 1852, marking the foundation of the Limerick Institute of Technology.

The Institute has a sporting ethos, and is located adjacent to Thomond Park and the Gaelic Grounds. It has connections to several enterprise centres: The National Franchise Centre; Croom Community Enterprise Centre; Thurles Chamber Enterprise Centre (TCEC); The Hartnett Enterprise Acceleration Centre (HEAC). Two further enterprise centres, the Enterprise and Research Centre, Clonmel and the Irish Fashion Incubator Limited (IFIL) were due to be added to its \"Enterprise Ladder\" in 2013.

Limerick was designated as a European City of Sport for 2011 by the European Capitals of Sport Association (ACES).\nThe National Elite Swimming Club is based in The University of Limerick Arena.\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\nSimilar to the rest of Ireland, basketball was a popular sport in Limerick during the 1970s and 1980s, with up to four divisions in the men's and women's local leagues. It suffered a decline during the 1990s culminating in the complete demise of local league basketball in the city and surrounding areas. The main clubs in the city were St. Colm's and Marathon with St. Colm's in particular having a long history in the National Leagues. Limerick is currently represented in the National Leagues by the men's UL Eagles team and the women's UL Aughinish team.

          "While it is great to have an open green space anywhere in the city, Arthur's Quay isn't the prettiest park. The location by the city is excellent but there is often rubbish around and so is not that inviting. It is at it's best when it's being used for events and festivals like",

          "The park is small and very neat. Its closeness to the Shanon river gives you a relaxing feel. The seats are few but comfortable. Its a good place to watch swans and the early morning sun",
          "We walked the streets of Limerick and came across the park, it's pretty but too many homeless people that make you a little uncomfortable but overall a nice place.",
          "Arthur's quay park is a small unpromising stark exposed cement amphitheatre at the river Shannon near sarsfield bridge and backing onto the Arthur's quay shopping centre. There's a busy bus stop that's also used by private coaches so there's usually people waiting around.",
          "Lovely place to view the river from the city, the treaty stone and king johns castle can also be seen from this park! Nice open park but can be quite cold because its right on the river, a lot of dog walkers in this park!",
          "It's nice place to just take a break there from shopping or work, but hard to call it is a park. Its location next to the Shannon where you can look at nice view of the river.",
          "Arthurs Quay Park is situated in the heart of Limerick City on the shore of the Shannon River. It has spectacular views of King Johns Castle which is located nearby. Unfortunately it is not a place to visit later in the afternoon and many locals avoid going there due to the",
          "We had a tour that left from here. The park is very nice and is near the quay of course. It is a nice area and worth a look.",

          "This is not much of a park - it's green on Google maps - which is not the case in reality. Most of it is concrete. We stopped here to have a quick bite to eat. It is dirty and there were drug dealers hanging around the steps. There is a great view of King John's Castle from here.",
          "It's small, the waiting spot for tourists who are going on day tours, and kind of dirty, but that said, you have a great view of the castle, and on a nice day, I'm sure it's nice to just take a break there.",
          "Nice to stroll through. It takes a minute. Not something to go out of your way for. Seems like a place people go to take a break from shopping or work.",
          "Nice views from here of the river and of John's castle. The city does make an effort and plant flowers and so on. However, I pass here everyday and it is very run down, some young people and middle aged people drinking alcohol ... while none has ever bothered me here it just",

          "This park, since its inception, has been something of a disaster. Where to even begin... First of all, it is tiny, it is barely even a park, most of it is concrete. It's one saving feature is its location next to the Shannon where you can get great photos of the river and",
          "I usually walk through the park if the weather is nice. There seems to be a large number of young adults hanging around the area often. There is an abandon building that sits on the corner and there always seems to be a number of people during dusk. When the carnival comes to",

        "wiki": "O'Connell Street is also the main street in Dublin, Ennis, Sligo and in various other towns around Ireland, and also the main street of North AdelaideO'Connell Street (Irish: Sr\u00e1id U\u00ed Chonaill) is the main thoroughfare of the city of Limerick. It was previously known as George's Street (after George III) until it was renamed after Daniel O'Connell. The street runs in parallel to the River Shannon and forms part of an overall thoroughfare, along with Rutland Street and Patrick Street, that bisects Limerick City Centre in a north east to south west direction. The street is about a mile in length, starting at the Arthurs Quay / Denmark Street junction and ending at The Crescent. A monument to Daniel O'Connell stands at the centre of The Crescent overlooking O'Connell Street. The street is noted for its Georgian architectural heritage.\n\n\n== Retail & Services ==\n\nRetail outlets on O'Connell Street include Brown Thomas, Debenhams and Penneys, while O'Mahony's have a large bookstore there founded in 1902. The George Hotel is also located on the street, which also acts as a regional financial services centre with a number of large retail banking operations, including Bank of Ireland, AIB, Ulster Bank and KBC Bank.\nA study carried out by the CBRE Ireland Research Team in 2012 found that 16% of retail units on O'Connell Street were vacant, making it the worst performing main city thoroughfare in Ireland in retail terms. The results also reflected poorly on the quality of retail offered on O'Connell Street with Limerick having the greatest proportion of fast food restaurants on its main street, at 21%, followed by footwear at 13%, and jewellery stores at 5%; this was in stark contrast to other Irish cities and towns where women's fashionwear occupies the core retail slots on the main streets and also offer a more mixed fashion offering.The Belltable Arts Centre, located at 69 O'Connell Street, is a multi-disciplinary venue which houses a 250-seat theatre/cinema, a 50-seat balcony studio (for occasional poetry and smaller performances), a visual arts gallery (hosting up to 12 exhibitions a year) and a basement restaurant. It hosts the Unfringed Festival, which is Limerick's only performance festival in spring.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nO'Connell Street dates from the late 18th to early 19th century as part of Edmund Sexton Pery's plan for the development of a new city on lands he owned to the south of the existing medieval city. In 1765, he commissioned the engineer Davis Ducart to design a town plan on those lands which have since become known as Newtown Pery. The centrepiece of this development was O'Connell Street. The street along with the rest of Newtown Pery was built to Georgian design and is part of Limerick's Georgian Quarter.\nThe street prospered from the time of its construction and quickly attracted the city's wealthier residents who then resided in the Englishtown area of medieval Limerick. The cramped and lofty Dutch styled dwellings of Englishtown and Irishtown were no match for the new, grand and spacious housing & thoroughfares of Newtown Pery. Although the street functioned as the main retail & commercial district of the city, this was (and remains today) primarily focused on the northern end of the street. The southern end of the street, in contrast, was more residential in character with the barrier being located about midway on the street (from the Cecil Street junction). Today, most of the residential townhouses on the street are now occupied by offices.\n\nFrom the 1950s onwards due to accidental damage from fire, neglect and poor planning by the city authorities a lot of the Georgian heritage has been lost on the northern end of the street around the retail core and has had an overall negative impact on the appearance of the street. Notable architectural losses include the fa\u00e7ades of Cannock's Department store and its landmark clock tower (now Penney's), Todd's Department Store (now Brown Thomas) and Cruises Hotel (now Cruises Street) amongst many more. Nevertheless, some of the finest examples Georgian townhouse architecture in Ireland still survives on the southern end and along the Crescent area of the street.\nFor a time the O'Connell Street & William Street/Sarsfield Street junction was historically an important crossroads junction in the west of Ireland with four national primary routes converging at the one place. The N7 from Dublin and the east, the N18 from Galway and the north, the N20 from Cork & Kerry and the south west and the N24 from Waterford and the south east all converged at the one place. Most of O'Connell Street was part of the N20 prior to the opening of the Limerick Southern Ring Road in 2004. It now forms part of the R527 regional road.\n\n\n=== Irish Civil War ===\nO'Connell Street was the location of the main incidents of the Irish Civil War in Limerick. The anti - treaty forces largely held four military barracks and most of the town while the Free state forces in the city held Cruises Hotel on O'Connell Street (along with Customs House, the Jail, the Courthouse, William Street RIC Barracks which were all located nearby). During this time Limerick saw much street fighting between the opposing forces which lasted three days. The fighting resulted in 15 deaths, seven of whom were civilians and eight Free State soldiers. Another 87 were wounded. (See: Irish Free State offensive)\n\n\n=== Todd's Fire ===\nOn 25 August 1959, Limerick's best known department store was the scene of the city's largest and most destructive fire. Todd's which occupied a large city block fronting onto O'Connell Street (now occupied by Brown Thomas) and William Street went on fire following an electrical fault. At 11 a.m. smoke was noticed coming from the William Street side of the store and by 12.30 the whole block became a blazing inferno. The fire spread and destroyed the stores adjoining Todd's including at the time Burtons, Liptons, Goodwins and Cesars which were completely gutted. A new store was built in place of the old store which was held by some to be a less attractive design, and which completely altered the appearance of the street.\n\n\n=== Cruises Street development ===\nIn the early 1990s one of Limerick's main landmarks - Cruises Hotel was demolished to make way for a new pedestrian street 'Cruises Street' at the northern end of O'Connell Street. The street was constructed to bring high end retailers to the city centre.\n\n\n=== Events ===\n\nOn 20 May 2006, O'Connell Street was closed so that 50,000 could crowd the street to watch the Heineken Cup Final, Munster vs. Biarritz on a massive screen.\nOn 24 May 2008, the street was closed again so that crowds could watch the Heineken Cup Final between Munster and Toulouse on a massive screen.\nThe Munster Rugby homecoming ceremony was also held on O'Connell Street on both occasions.\nIn September 1998 thousands gathered in O'Connell Street for a speech given by the then President of the United States, Bill Clinton.\nIn May 1964, thousands lined O'Connell Street as senator Ted Kennedy gave a speech from Cruises Hotel. The visit came just 5 months after the assassination of his brother John F. Kennedy who had also visited Limerick in 1963.\nThe annual St. Patrick's Day parade takes place on O'Connell Street every year on the 17 March as well as the annual Limerick International Marching Band Competition which takes place on the weekend nearest to St. Patrick's Day.\n\n\n== Present ==\nO'Connell Street, along with much of Limerick city centre, is in decline and has been for some time. Some of the reasons for this are:\nthe depopulation of the city centre from the 1950s onwards\nthe movement of industry and State services from city centre areas to suburban areas, and lack of replacement\nwhat some hold to be a disastrous retail strategy by the local authorities (Limerick City Council and Limerick County Council), that saw (in some cases) the construction of large shopping centres in suburban areas, now more accessible by car to the general public with a better selection of shops, and in direct competition with City Centre traders.\nupward-only rent reviews, the economic collapse of 2008 onwards coupled with the reduction of footfall on the street, and an unemployment rate in the city of 28.6% (CSO figures released in 2012),  that resulted in the closure of many of the stores on O'Connell Street which accelerated the decline from 2008 onwards\nhigh vacancy rates on streets leading to O'Connell Street with little or no retail offering or business activity on Rutland Street, Patrick Street (The Opera Centre) or Sarsfield Street.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCruises Street\nWilliam Street\nHenry Street\nNewtown Pery\nDaniel O'Connell\nEdmund Sexton Pery\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Limerick (; Irish: Luimneach [\u02c8l\u032a\u02e0\u026am\u02b2(\u0259)n\u02b2\u0259x]) is a city in County Limerick, Ireland. It is located in the Mid-West Region and is also part of the province of Munster. With a population of 94,192 at the 2016 census, Limerick is the third-most populous urban area in the state, and the fourth-most populous city on the island of Ireland. The city lies on the River Shannon, with the historic core of the city located on King's Island, which is bounded by the Shannon and Abbey Rivers. Limerick is also located at the head of the Shannon Estuary, where the river widens before it flows into the Atlantic Ocean. Limerick City and County Council is the local authority for the city.\n\n\n== Geography and political subdivisions ==\nAt the 2016 census, the Metropolitan District of Limerick had a population of 104,952. On 1 June 2014 following the merger of Limerick City and County Council, a new Metropolitan District of Limerick was formed within the united council, which extended the city area. The Metropolitan District includes the city urban area and extends outwards towards Patrickswell in the west and Castleconnell in the east. The City Metropolitan Area however excludes city suburbs located within County Clare.\nLimerick is one of the constituent cities of the Cork\u2013Limerick\u2013Galway corridor, which has a population of 1 million people. It is located at a strategic position on the River Shannon with four main crossing points near the city centre. To the south of the city is the Golden Vale, an area of rich pastureland. Historically, much of the city's industry was based on this rich agricultural hinterland, and it is particularly noted for Limerick ham.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient and medieval history ===\nLuimneach originally referred to the general area along the banks of the Shannon Estuary known as Loch Luimnigh. The earliest settlement in the city, Inis Sibhtonn, was the original name for King's Island during the pre-Viking and Viking eras. This island was also called Inis an Ghaill Duibh, 'The Dark-(haired) Foreigner's Island'. The name is recorded in Viking sources as Hlymrekr.\nThe city dates from 812; however, history suggests the presence of earlier settlements in the area surrounding King's Island, the island at the historical city centre. Antiquity's map-maker, Ptolemy, produced in 150 the earliest map of Ireland, showing a place called Regia at the same site as King's Island. History also records an important battle involving Cormac mac Airt in 221 and a visit by Saint Patrick in 434 to baptise an E\u00f3ganachta king, Carthann the Fair. Saint Munchin, the first bishop of Limerick died in 652, indicating the city was a place of some note. In 812 the Vikings sailed up the Shannon and pillaged the city, burned the monastery of Mungret but were forced to flee when the Irish attacked and killed many of their number. The Normans redesigned the city in the 12th century and added much of the most notable architecture, such as King John's Castle and St Mary's Cathedral.In early medieval times Limerick was at the centre of the Kingdom of Thomond which corresponds to the present day County Clare, the Kingdom also included North Kerry and parts of South Offaly. One of the kingdom's most notable kings was Brian Boru, ancestor of the O'Brien Clan of Dalcassians. The word Thomond is synonymous with the region and is retained in place names such as Thomondgate, Thomond Bridge and Thomond Park.\n\n\n=== Late Renaissance/Early modern history ===\n\nLimerick in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was often called the most beautiful city in Ireland. The English-born judge Luke Gernon, a resident of Limerick, wrote in 1620 that at his first sight of the city he had been amazed at its magnificence: \"lofty buildings of marble, like the Colleges in Oxford\".During the civil wars of the 17th century the city played a pivotal role, besieged by Oliver Cromwell in 1651 and twice by the Williamites in the 1690s. The Treaty of Limerick ended the Williamite war in Ireland which was fought between supporters of the Catholic King James II (Jacobites) and the Protestant King William of Orange (Williamites). The treaty offered toleration to Catholicism and full legal rights to Catholics that swore an oath of loyalty to William III and Mary II. The Treaty was of national significance as it ensured closer British and Protestant dominance over Ireland. The articles of the Treaty protecting Catholic rights were not passed by the Protestant Irish Parliament which rather updated the Penal Laws against Catholics which had major implications for Irish history. Reputedly the Treaty was signed on the Treaty Stone, an irregular block of limestone which once served as a mounting block for horses. This stone is now displayed on a pedestal at Clancy Strand. Because of the treaty, Limerick is sometimes known as the Treaty City. This turbulent period earned the city its motto: urbs antiqua fuit studisque asperrima belli (an ancient city well studied in the arts of war).\nThe peaceful times that followed the turmoil of the late 17th century allowed the city to prosper through trade in the late 18th century. During this time Limerick Port established itself as one of Ireland's major commercial ports exporting agricultural produce from one of Ireland's most fertile areas, the Golden Vale, to Britain and America. This increase in trade and wealth, particularly amongst the city's merchant classes saw a rapid expansion of the city as Georgian Limerick began to take shape. This gave the city its present-day look including the extensive terraced streets of Georgian townhouses which remain in the city centre today. The Waterford and Limerick Railway linked the city to the Dublin\u2013Cork railway line in 1848 and to Waterford in 1853. The opening of a number of secondary railways in the subsequent decades developed Limerick as a regional centre of communications.  However, the economic downturn in the European conflicts of the French Revolution and Napoleonic eras, and following the Act of Union 1800, and the impact of the Great Irish Famine of 1848 caused much of the 19th century to be a more troubled period.\n\n\n=== 20th-century history ===\n\nThe Limerick boycott was an economic boycott waged against the small Jewish community for over two years in the first decade of the 20th century. It was accompanied by a number of assaults, stone throwing and intimidation, which caused many Jews to leave the city. It was instigated in 1904 by a Redemptorist priest, Father John Creagh.\nDuring the Irish War of Independence, the Limerick Soviet was a self-declared soviet that existed from 15 to 27 April 1919. A general strike was organised by the Limerick Trades and Labour Council, as a protest against the British Army's declaration of a \"Special Military Area\" under the Defence of the Realm Act, which covered most of Limerick city and a part of the county. During the strike a special strike committee was set up to print their own money, control food prices and publish newspapers.\nBy the mid-20th century, Limerick was characterised by economic stagnation and decline as many traditional industries closed or left the city. However, there were some success stories. In 1942 Shannon Airport (located in County Clare, 20 km west of the city) opened for the first time offering transatlantic flights. In 1959, Shannon Airport enabled the opening of the Shannon Free Zone which attracted a large number of multinational companies to the region. A long campaign for a third level educational institute to be located in the city finally bore fruit with the establishment of NIHE Limerick in 1969 which eventually became the University of Limerick in 1989.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nThe local government area of Limerick city is under the jurisdiction of Limerick City and County Council. The Council has responsibility for local services such as sanitation, planning and development, libraries, collection of motor taxation, local roads and social housing in the city. The council comprises elected ward Councillors with an appointed full-time CEO as the city (and county) manager. Local elections are held every five years and the Councillors annually elect a Cathaoirleach or chairman to chair the council. As of 2015, the Cathaoirleach was Cllr Liam Galvin from the Newcastle West electoral area. The 21 Councillors from the 3 electoral districts in the City Metropolitan Area also elect a mayor to represent the city. The Mayoral position is largely ceremonial and has much reduced responsibility following the merger of the Limerick local authorities. Although the Mayor is the city's first citizen, within the council the position is below that of the Cathaoirleach. The current mayor is Councillor Jerry O'Dea. Former well-known mayors include TDs Donogh O'Malley, Stephen Coughlan, Michael Lipper, Jim Kemmy and Jan O'Sullivan.Throughout most of the city's history; from 1197 when it gained its first charter, Limerick City had its own local government authority, Limerick Corporation later known as Limerick City Council. The council was one of the oldest in Ireland and was only exceeded in age by Dublin City Council. In October 2012 the Government of Ireland published Putting People First- Action Programme for Effective Local Government which set out Government policy for reforms across all the main areas of local government in Ireland. Among the recommendations was the merging of Limerick City Council with Limerick County Council. The changes came into effect on 1 June 2014 following the implementation of the Local Government Reform Act 2014.By the 1960s onwards the city had outgrown its boundary considerably; the city boundary was only altered slightly and never reflected the overall urban area of the city. A limited boundary extension on the city's north side in 2008 enlarged the city boundary by 1,020 hectares increasing the city's area by almost 50% and raising the population by an estimated 7,000. The previous boundary, encompassing 2,086 hectares, was delineated in 1950. Newer suburban districts such as Dooradoyle, Castletroy \u2013 including the University, Gouldavoher, and Raheen were continually administered to by Limerick County Council until the merger of the two authorities in June 2014. This local government structure in Limerick caused a number of inefficiencies, most notably in the area of planning. A number of suburbs such as Westbury and Parteen to the north of the city are governed by Clare County Council.\nFollowing the merger of the two authorities in 2014 a new Metropolitan District of Limerick City was set up that included the city urban area and also settlements close to the city such as Patrickswell and Castleconnell. The Metropolitan district returns 21 Councillors to Limerick City and County Council which in total has 40 Councillors returned from across Limerick City and County. The Limerick City Metropolitan District is divided into 3 wards or electoral areas which are; Limerick City East, Limerick City North and Limerick City South which elect eight, six and seven Councillors respectively.Following the 2019 local elections, Fine Gael was the largest party on the united authority with 13 seats followed by Fianna F\u00e1il with 12, Labour with 3, Sinn F\u00e9in and the Green Party (Ireland) with 2 each, the Social Democrats with 1 seat, and Independents and other parties the remaining 6 seats.For national D\u00e1il elections Limerick City is in the Limerick City constituency. From 2011, the constituency boundaries changed in accordance with the proposals of the Constituency Commission and the subsequent Electoral (Amendment) Act 2009. This changed the electoral boundaries from Limerick East and Limerick West to Limerick City and Limerick. Limerick city encompasses the city, the suburban areas of Castletroy and as far east as Castleconnell. It also includes part of south County Clare. The Limerick county constituency takes in most of the rest of the county. For European parliament elections Limerick is in South Ireland.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nLimerick's climate is classified as temperate oceanic (K\u00f6ppen Cfb). Met \u00c9ireann maintains a climatological weather station at Shannon Airport, 20 kilometres west of the city in County Clare. Shannon Airport records an average of 977 millimetres of precipitation annually, most of which is rain. Limerick has a mild climate, with the average daily maximum in July of 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) and the average daily minimum in January of 3 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F). The highest temperature recorded was 32.0 \u00b0C (89.6 \u00b0F) in June 2018, and the lowest \u221211.4 \u00b0C (11.5 \u00b0F) in 2010. Limerick is the cloudiest city in the state, averaging only 1,295 sunshine hours annually, 3.5 hours of sunshine every day. There are on average 62 days of no recordable sunshine, 6 days of thunder, 22 days of hail and 11 days of snow per year. Shannon Airport is located by the ocean at an elevation of 14 metres, so snow is less common at the station than in the city itself.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn 2014, Limerick became Ireland's inaugural National City of Culture, with a variety of artistic and cultural events occurring at locations around the city throughout the year.\nThe Limerick City Gallery of Art on Pery Square is the city's chief venue for contemporary art exhibitions. It is home to a permanent collection of Irish art, which shows works from the early 18th to 20th century. The gallery houses the National Collection of Contemporary Drawing founded by the artist Samuel Walsh in 1987. Limerick's major contemporary art event is EVA International, Ireland's Biennial of Contemporary Art. EVA International, centered mainly in the Limerick City Gallery of Art, is curated by varying guest curators and includes contemporary artworks by both international and Irish artists.The Lime Tree Theatre officially opened at the Mary Immaculate College campus in October 2012. The venue hosts theatre, music, comedy, traditional arts, schools' performances and conferences.The Belltable Arts Centre on O'Connell Street hosts local playwrights and drama productions. The University Concert Hall located in UL is a 1,000 seat venue and provides a large venue for national and international acts to visit the city. Limerick is also the home of street theatre companies, including \"The Umbrella Project\".\nLimerick's literature scene is supported by projects like the Limerick Writers' Centre, which was established in 2008 and runs a range of writing activities in the city. Limerick natives include Pulitzer Prize winning author, Frank McCourt; novelists Kate O'Brien, Michael Curtin, Kevin Barry and Donal Ryan. Poets from Limerick include Michael Hogan, Desmond O'Grady, and John Liddy.Other Limerick arts groups include Contact Studios, which provides individual studio spaces for visual artists; the Daghdha Dance Company, a contemporary dance company that has adopted a renovated church in John's Square, adjacent to St John's Cathedral, as a performance space); the Fresh Film Festival, which is held each spring, and includes films made by young people (7\u201318 years); Impact Theatre Company; and Limerick Printmakers Studio and Gallery, which provides printmaking facilities, a venue for exhibitions and events and an education programme. The Limerick Youth Theatre provides young people with an opening into acting and production.The Irish Chamber Orchestra and the Irish World Music Centre are both based in the University of Limerick. The university has a thousand-seat state-of-the-art concert hall that hosts visiting performers. The city's music scene has produced bands such as The Cranberries, guitarist Noel Hogan's MonoBand, The Hitchers and others. Electronic musician Richard D. James, more commonly known as Aphex Twin, was born in Limerick in 1971. The Limerick Art Gallery and the Art College cater for painting, sculpture and performance art.\nLimerick is also home to comedians The Rubberbandits, D'Unbelievables (Pat Shortt and Jon Kenny) and Karl Spain. Dolan's Warehouse on the Dock Road is a venue specialising in live music, established in 1998. Baker Place was a nightclub that held mainly local underground nights until its closure in 2011. In 2020, it was announced that the Dromkeen-based Shiloh Trust was seeking planning permission to convert the former premises of Baker Place into a bible school. The Crush 87 nightclub (formerly known as Trinity Rooms until its closure in 2010), was relaunched in 2013.The city is the setting for Frank McCourt's memoir Angela's Ashes and the film adaptation. The Frank McCourt Museum situated in Frank's former school on Hartsonge Street opened in 2011 and contains artefacts from the book. Limerick has also been the setting or location for a number of other films, including the dramas The Real Thing (2002), Cowboys & Angels (2003) and Lost & Found (2015).Riverfest is a summer festival held annually in Limerick since 2004. The 2014 festival was held in May and had a record 80,000 visitors.\n\n\n== Humorous verse ==\nA limerick is a type of humorous verse of five lines with an AABBA rhyme scheme: the poem's connection with the city is obscure, but the name is generally taken to be a reference to Limerick city or County Limerick, sometimes particularly to the Maigue Poets, and may derive from an earlier form of nonsense verse parlour game that traditionally included a refrain that included \"Will [or won't] you come (up) to Limerick?\" The earliest known use of the name \"Limerick\" for this type poem is an 1880 reference, in a Saint John, New Brunswick newspaper, to an apparently well-known tune.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Broadcasting ===\nRT\u00c9 lyric fm, a state-run classical music radio station and part of RT\u00c9, broadcasts nationally from studios in the city centre on Cornmarket Square which opened in 1994. Limerick's local radio station is Live 95FM, broadcasting from 'Radio House', near the waterfront at Steamboat Quay. Spin South West, owned by Communicorp, broadcasts to Counties Kerry, Clare, Limerick, Tipperary and southwest Laois from its studios at Landmark Buildings in the Raheen Industrial Estate. Student radio station, Wired FM, broadcasts on 99.9FM from Mary Immaculate College. Wired FM also has studios in Limerick Institute of Technology. University Hospital Limerick has a radio station on 94.2FM, but this can be heard only in the hospital and surrounding area. West Limerick 102 is broadcast from Newcastle West. The national broadcaster, RT\u00c9, has radio and television studios in the city, which are periodically used to broadcast programming from Limerick.\n\n\n=== Print ===\nSeveral local newspapers are published in the city, including The Limerick Post and The Limerick Leader and magazines include the Limerick Event Guide, Business Limerick and Limerick Now.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\nLimerick city is approximately 25 km from Shannon Airport. Tourist attractions in the city centre include Limerick City Museum, King John's Castle (1210), St Mary's Cathedral (1168), the Hunt Museum, the University of Limerick, Georgian houses and gardens and the Treaty Stone.  There are several seasonal tours, including Angela's Ashes walking tour of Limerick City, historical walking tour, and boat tours along the River Shannon.\nThe city centre is divided between the traditional areas of \"English Town\" on the southern end of King's Island, which includes the King John's Castle; \"Irish Town\", which includes the older streets on the south bank; and the current economic centre further south, called \"Newtown Pery\". Newtown Pery was built in the late 18th century before the Act of Union and, unusually for an Irish city and unique in Limerick, is laid out on a grid plan. The Limerick City Museum (formerly aka the Jim Kemmy Municipal Museum), is located in Istabraq Hall, City Hall, Merchant's Quay. It contains displays on Limerick's history and manufactures.\n\nThe Georgian core of the city, with its Georgian architecture in the Newtown Pery, was developed from the mid 18th century. This core includes O'Connell Street (George Street before independence) from the Cecil Street intersection running to the south west end of the Crescent, and south-east to Pery Street including Glentworth Street and Barrington Street. Other buildings of architectural note in the city are St John's Cathedral, designed by the notable Victorian architect, Philip Charles Hardwick. St Mary's Cathedral, at over 800 years old, is one of the oldest in Ireland. St John's Cathedral, whilst more modern, has Ireland's tallest spire at 94 m (308 ft).\nThe Hunt Museum is based in the historic 18th-century former Custom House. The museum was established to house a collection of approximately 2000 works of art and antiquities formed by John and Gertrude Hunt during their lifetimes.\nThe main park in Limerick is the People's Park which was opened in 1877 in memory of Richard Russell, a prominent local business man. The park is dominated by the Thomas Spring Rice memorial (MP for the city 1820\u20131832) and has a large collection of mature deciduous and evergreen trees.\nLimerick city centre changed significantly with the construction of several modern high-rise buildings in the early 2000s, in particular as part of the regeneration of the former docks area along the Dock Road. The suburban areas, where the majority of the population now live, have grown out from the centre along the main roads to Ennis (North Circular and Ennis Road areas/Caherdavin), Dublin (Castletroy and the University) and Cork (Ballinacurra/Dooradoyle/Raheen). Suburban houses are generally two-floor semi-detached homes for single families. These were built from the 1950s onwards in large estates by government projects and commercial developments, although there are many examples of Edwardian and older 1930s suburban homes on the main suburban thoroughfares leading towards the city (North & South Circular, Ballinacurra Road, O'Connell Avenue).\n\nLimerick city's nightlife is supported by a number of nightclubs and pubs which offer music. For example, Dolan's Warehouse is a small music venue which hosts local, national and international folk, indie, jazz, rock and traditional Irish music acts.In County Limerick, Adare village and the Foynes Flying Boat Museum, approximately 35 km (22 miles/30 minutes) from Limerick City along the scenic coastal N69 route from Limerick to Tralee, are also attractions. Bunratty Castle in County Clare is another local attraction, and is situated 15.4 km north of the city. Limerick is known to be the antipodes to the Campbell Islands of New Zealand.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nLimerick is the third largest city in Ireland (after Dublin and Cork) with a population of 94,192 in the urban area and 104,952 in the metropolitan district, according to the 2016 CSO census. The past census reported a large population decline in central city areas due in part to the Limerick regeneration process where in these areas the largest reduction was reported nationally and also to outward migration following the collapse of the local and national economy from 2008 onwards. The population of the Limerick Larger Urban Zone as defined by the EU is 162,413. The ethnic diversity in Limerick's population, which includes a large immigrant community, saw rapid growth during the Celtic Tiger and the following decade. The Polish community is one of the largest demographic groups in the Municipal District, with approximately 4,000 living and working in the area. Ireland's first Polish bank opened in 2007. The African community has set up a number of churches, which are now part of the cultural makeup of the city.Limerick has a large stock of local authority housing. Prior to the merger of Limerick City and County Council 41% of all housing within the old Limerick City Council boundary was local authority, which was the highest in Ireland. This figure is however no longer accurate given the larger metropolitan district of the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nLimerick is in the region dubbed \"the Midwest\". Also known as the \"Shannon Region\", this is primarily an economic and social concept. The region encompasses County Limerick, County Clare, North County Tipperary, Northwest County Kerry and south County Offaly, with its focal point centred on Limerick and its environs within an 8-kilometre (5 mi) radius.\nThe area is the main economic region in Ireland outside Dublin and Cork. Its economic development has been driven in part by the University of Limerick, Limerick Institute of Technology, Shannon Airport in County Clare and Shannon Development (an economic development agency), whose precursor was SFADCO (Shannon Free Airport Development Company), an economic agency that provided tax incentives to companies locating in the area surrounding Shannon Airport. As of 2006 Shannon Development was mostly concerned with disposing of valuable industrial park properties. Limerick Chamber of Commerce, a representative body for businesses in the region, celebrated its bicentennial/bicentenary in 2015.\nHistorically Limerick was an agricultural commodity-driven economy, due to its position as the first major port along the River Shannon. By the middle of the 18th century, Limerick Port grew to become one of Ireland's principal commercial ports, exporting agricultural produce from the most fertile tracts in Ireland known as the Golden Vale as well as produce from the surrounding counties. The city was one of the main meat processing areas in Ireland, and industry included confectionery and flour production. The city was known for its bacon industry \u2013 however this went into decline in the mid-20th century. The fishing industry in Limerick, based on Clancy's Strand opposite King John's Castle and at Coonagh nearby, once employed hundreds of men. The boat most commonly used was the Gandelow which was also used as a small Lighter (barge) to ferry goods to and from larger ships in the port. In the 1920s the construction of a dam at Ardnacrusha severely impacted salmon breeding and that, and the introduction of quotas, had by the 1950s caused salmon fishing to diminish. By 2006, most fishermen had relinquished their drift net licences and the industry can now be said to be dormant.As with other cities in Ireland, a number of multinational companies are based in Limerick, and the city is a growing recipient of foreign direct investment. Dell had its main European Manufacturing Facility at the Raheen Business Park however in January 2009 Dell announced that it would close its Limerick computer manufacturing plant and move the production lines to Poland. The facility was the largest Dell manufacturing plant outside the United States and produced 30,000\u201360,000 units per day for export to the EMEA. Dell remains one of the largest employers in the mid-west with over 1,000 people employed in service and support. Analog Devices has its European manufacturing base in Raheen, 3 km south-west of the city centre. The site employs more than 1,000 people. Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Vistakon (the world's largest manufacturer of contact lenses) has a large facility in Castletroy in the National Technology Park and also employs close to 1,000 people. It is Vistakon's only production facility outside the United States and one of the largest contact-lens manufacturing plants in the world. Cook Medical, the world's largest privately owned Medical Devices company, employs over 800 people in Limerick at the National Technology Park.\nThe Post-2008 Irish economic downturn had a profound effect on Limerick. The announcement in 2009 that Dell was to move its manufacturing facility from Limerick to Poland devastated the local economy. 1,900 jobs were lost at Dell and it is believed that for every job that was lost at Dell at least another 4 to 5 were at risk. The closure of the Dell manufacturing facility amounted to 2% of Ireland's national GDP. The downturn in the construction industry also cost many jobs as did the stalled Limerick regeneration programme which promised investment in Limerick's deprived city areas. As of 2012 unemployment had become a major problem across the city with the unemployment rate in the city at 28.6% which was almost twice the national average.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nThe Crescent Shopping Centre is the largest shopping centre in Ireland, outside of Dublin, and the largest in the province of Munster. It is located in Dooradoyle about 3 km south of the city centre, and has over 90 shopping outlets along with restaurants and a 12-screen Omniplex Cinema. The city centre also has a large retail district which includes a mix of more traditional type of shops as well as some modern high street stores. Cruises Street is one of the main shopping streets. O'Connell Street, William Street, Bedford Row and Thomas Street) are also retail streets within the city. The city centre saw some works on remodelling in the early 21st century, with pedestrianisation works on Bedford Row, Thomas Street and parts of Catherine Street, as well as widening footpaths on William Street. These works have sought to address a reduction of footfall in the city centre (in turn influencing the closure of many city centre retail businesses) which occurred from the recession of 2008 onwards.\n\n\n==== Retail parks and shopping centres ====\n\nDuring the Celtic Tiger years a number of shopping centres and retail parks opened in suburban areas of Limerick. In addition to the Crescent Shopping Centre, which expanded in the early 2000s, the Jetland Shopping Centre opened in Caherdavin in 2005. The Childers Road Retail Park and the Parkway Shopping Centre in the east of the city also have a number of high street stores. Unfinished retail centres include the Coonagh Cross retail development and the Parkway Valley Shopping Centre on the Dublin Road. A proposed but unapproved retail development project, the Opera Centre, makes up part of the \"Limerick 2030\" scheme.\n\n\n==== The Milk Market ====\nThe Milk Market located at Cornmarket Row in the city centre sells locally produced foods and products and is governed by Limerick Market Trustees. In 2010 work was undertaken to redevelop the existing premises to an all-weather, all year round facility as it operated in an outdoor environment. The work involved constructing a large canopy over the existing market premises and was officially re-opened in June 2010. The Milk Market Project won the 2011 Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI) 'Peoples Choice Award'.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nIn 2013, a renewable energy strategy was launched for the region, and proposed a 20% reduction in CO2-emissions, while ensuring that short-term actions were beneficial to the long-term goal of 100% renewable energy. The strategy was completed by the Danish Aalborg University.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\nShannon Airport is 20 km west of the city in County Clare. It is one of Ireland's main airports and is easily accessible from Limerick via the N18 dual carriageway and from other regions via the Limerick Tunnel. It has scheduled flights to European and North American destinations. Airlines using the airport include Ryanair, Aer Lingus, United Airlines, American Airlines, Aer Lingus Regional and Delta Air Lines. There is no rail link to the airport. Coonagh airfield, a few kilometres west of Caherdavin, serves small private aircraft. Kerry and Cork Airports are around 1 hour 30 minutes and 2 hours drive away, respectively. Kerry Airport is connected to Farranfore railway station, from Limerick railway station travel via Limerick Junction and Mallow.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nLocal public transport is provided by several companies. Bus \u00c9ireann, Ireland's state-owned bus company, operates a number of services subsidised by the National Transport Authority, while a number of provide operators also run commercial bus services in and around Limerick. An updated city bus network was introduced in Limerick City in December 2016, which introduced new routes. In May 2019, Bus \u00c9ireann further changed and improved the Limerick City timetable, including increased frequency and later operating times.\nOther rural buses run to towns and villages in the county and to Shannon Airport. There are also a number of Intercity and international buses from Bus \u00c9ireann's bus terminal adjoining Limerick Colbert railway station. These include hourly services to Dublin, Cork, Ennis and Galway. Bus \u00c9ireann have also commenced a Limerick to Galway Express service travelling on the M18 in addition to the regular service. Buses run every 2 hours to Tralee and Killarney. There are also regular daily services to Waterford and Athlone, and a daily service to London via the ferry from Rosslare Europort.\nThere are a number of private bus companies in operation providing city and intercity services. Dublin Coach provide the M7 express service which operates every hour from Arthur's Quay which goes to Dublin or Ennis. JJ Kavanagh also provide Dublin to Limerick services from Arthur's Quay. Citylink run a number of services from Limerick to Galway and Cork and operate from Henry Street.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nIarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann's Limerick Colbert station is the railway hub for the city and the Mid West Region with a number of intercity and commuter rail services. Limerick railway station opened on 28 August 1858, replacing an earlier, temporary station 500 m east, which had operated from 9 May 1848.The following inter city routes are available from Limerick Colbert station :\n\nLimerick to Dublin Heuston: 16 services daily including 4 direct services. All remaining Dublin \u2013 Limerick services require passengers to change to the Dublin to Cork train at either Limerick Junction or at Ballybrophy railway station.\nLimerick to Waterford: 2 services daily (but none on Sundays). Passengers must change train at Limerick Junction to continue to Waterford with stations at Tipperary, Cahir, Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir.\nLimerick to Galway: 5 services daily. This service reopened on 29 March 2010.\nLimerick to Cork: Passengers can travel between Limerick and Cork via Limerick Junction. There is no direct service.\nLimerick to Killarney, Farranfore and Tralee: Passengers can travel between Limerick and Killarney, Farranfore and Tralee via Limerick Junction where trains run via Mallow to reach County Kerry.There are 3 suburban/commuter services in the Limerick Suburban Rail network:\n\nLimerick \u2013 Ennis calling at Sixmilebridge\nLimerick \u2013 Nenagh calling at Castleconnell and Birdhill (with some services continuing to Cloughjordan & Roscrea & connecting to the Dublin-Cork railway line at Ballybrophy.) Due to speed restrictions this alternative Dublin \u2013 Limerick route can take 60 minutes longer (with a change at Ballybrophy) than by Limerick Junction albeit a more direct service.\nLimerick \u2013 Limerick Junction and ThurlesThere are also a number of disused railway lines including the Limerick to Foynes line which closed to freight in the early 2000s, having lost passenger services in the early 1960s, although the track is still in situ.  This is the last remaining part of the North Kerry Line which closed to passenger traffic in the early 1960s and to freight traffic (other than Limerick \u2013 Foynes) in the mid-1970s, and has been lifted between Ballingrane (near Rathkeale) and Tralee.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nLimerick's central location in the mid\u2013west of Ireland means many national primary routes converge on the city. The M7 (Dublin), N/M18 (Galway, Ennis, Shannon), N/M20 (Cork), N21 (Tralee) and N24 (Waterford) routes all start/terminate in or near the city. Road infrastructure is further supplemented by the southern ring road and Limerick Tunnel bypass of the city and the M20 bypass of Dooradoyle and Raheen to the south of the city. Connections to the other cities were improved with the completion of the M7 motorway in December 2010, and continuing upgrades ongoing to the N/M18 to Shannon, Ennis, Galway and Tuam \u2013 the final section opened in September 2017. A motorway is also planned between Cork and Limerick, with a proposed completion date in the mid 2020s.\n\n\n=== Waterway transport ===\nHistorically, waterway transport has been key to Limerick's development. Vikings established the city as a maritime trading port. The city's position on a major Irish river system, the Shannon, enabled transport to the midlands of Ireland and further north and west. By the 18th century with the opening of canal systems throughout Ireland, Limerick Port established itself as Ireland's premier commercial port on the western side of the country. This was enabled by ease of access from the facilitated by the opening of canals but most importantly to the River Shannon. The opening of the Grand Canal in the 18th century provided further access to Dublin and the east of the country. There are also a number of disused canals in the vicinity of the city including the Park Canal & the Passey \u2013 Errina Canal on the old Limerick navigation. Waterway transport on the Shannon was regularly used to transport goods from Limerick to Dublin and vice versa however this mode of transport fell into decline in the 20th century. Originally Limerick port was located near the confluence of the Abbey and Shannon rivers at King's Island. Today the Shannon Foynes Port is located further downstream on the Shannon alongside the Dock Road. This general purpose facility port is operated by the Shannon Foynes Port Company who operate all marine activities in the Shannon estuary.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nLimerick is a centre of higher education in the region, and technical and continuation education within the city traces its beginning back to the formation of the Limerick Athenaeum Society in 1852, marking the foundation of the Limerick Institute of Technology.  The Society's aims included \"the promotion of Literature, Science, Art and Music\".Today, Limerick is home to a number of higher-education institutions including the University of Limerick, Limerick Institute of Technology and Mary Immaculate College and has a student population of over 20,000.The University of Limerick (UL), has a student population of over 13,000, and is about 5 km east of the city centre in the suburb of Castletroy. It was established as the National Institute for Higher Education (NIHE) in 1972, and in 1989 was the first university to be established since the foundation of the State in 1922. Its academic programs include courses in engineering, information technology, materials science, sports science, humanities, teacher education, social sciences and music. In 2007, the university opened a medical school. The Irish World Music Centre specialises in traditional music and dance, and UL is host to the Irish Chamber Orchestra. The campus includes a 50m Olympic-standard swimming complex, the first to be established in Ireland.

Their most successful period was from the 1960s to the 1980s when they won 2 League of Ireland championships and two FAI Cups. The club played at Markets Field until the mid-1980s when they controversially moved to a new venue. A period of declining fortunes and a nomadic existence followed.

        "wiki": "Bunratty Castle (Irish: Caisle\u00e1n Bhun Raithe, meaning \"Castle at the Mouth of the Ratty\") is a large 15th-century tower house in County Clare, Ireland. It is located in the centre of Bunratty village (Irish: Bun R\u00e1ite), by the N18 road between Limerick and Ennis, near Shannon Town and its airport. The castle and the adjoining folk park are run by Shannon Heritage as tourist attractions.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name Bunratty, Bun Raite (or possibly, Bun na Raite) in Irish, means \"river basin\" of the 'Ratty' river. This river, alongside the castle, flows into the nearby Shannon estuary.\n\n\n=== Earlier structures ===\n\nThe first recorded settlement at the site may have been a Norsemen settlement/trading camp reported in the Annals of the Four Masters to have been destroyed by Brian Boru in 977. According to local tradition, such a camp was located on a rise south-west of the current castle. However, since no actual remains of this settlement have yet been found, its exact location is unknown and its existence is not proven.Around 1250, King Henry III of England granted the cantred or district of Tradraighe (or Tradree) to Robert De Muscegros, who in 1251 cut down around 200 trees in the King's wood at Cratloe. These may have been used to construct a motte and bailey castle, which would have been the first castle at Bunratty, but again the exact position of this is unknown. A later reference in the state papers, dating to 1253 gives de Muscegros the right to hold markets and an annual fair at Bunratty. It has thus been assumed that the site was the centre of early Norman control in south-eastern Clare. Early 19th-century scholars put the structure to the north-west of the current castle. However, when a hotel was constructed there in 1959, John Hunt excavated the area and thought the remains to be that of a gun emplacement from the Confederate Wars (see below).\n\nThese lands were later handed back to (or taken back by) King Henry III and granted to Thomas De Clare, a descendant of Strongbow in 1276. De Clare built the first stone structure on the site (the second castle). This castle was occupied from ca. 1278 to 1318 and consisted of a large single stone tower with lime white walls. It stood close to the river, on or near the site of the present Bunratty Castle. In the late 13th century, Bunratty had about 1,000 inhabitants. The castle was attacked several times by the O'Briens (or O'Brians) and their allies. In 1284, while De Clare was away in England, the site was captured and destroyed. On his return, in 1287, De Clare had the site rebuilt and a 140-yard (130 m) long fosse built around it. The castle was again attacked but it did not fall until 1318. In that year a major battle was fought at Dysert O'Dea as part of the Irish Bruce Wars, in which both Thomas De Clare and his son Richard were killed. Lady De Clare, on learning this, fled from Bunratty to Limerick after burning castle and town. The De Clare family never returned to the area and the remains of the castle eventually collapsed. As the stones were likely used for other local construction works, no traces remain of this second castle.In the 14th century, Limerick was an important port for the English Crown. To guard access via the Shannon estuary against attacks from the Irish, the site was once again occupied. In 1353, Sir Thomas de Rokeby led an English army to conquer the MacNamaras and MacCarthys. A new castle (the third) was built at Bunratty, but once again, its exact location is unknown. Local tradition holds that it stood at the site where the Bunratty Castle Hotel was later constructed. However, the new structure was hardly finished before being captured by the Irish. Documents show that in 1355, King Edward III of England released Thomas Fitzjohn Fitzmaurice from prison in Limerick. He had been charged with letting the castle fall into the hands of Murtough O\u2019Brien whilst serving as a Governor (Captain) of Bunratty.\n\n\n=== Current structure ===\nThe fourth castle, the present structure, was built by the MacNamara family after around 1425. Its builder may have been one Maccon Sioda MacNamara, chieftain of Clann Cuilein (i.e. the MacNamaras). He died before the castle was completed which happened under his son Sean Finn (died in 1467). At around 1500, Bunratty Castle came into the hands of the O'Briens (or O'Brians), the most powerful clan in Munster and later Earls of Thomond. They expanded the site and eventually made it their chief seat, moving it there from Ennis.In 1558, the castle\u2014now noted as one of the principal strongholds of Thomond\u2014was taken by Thomas Radclyffe, the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland from Donal O'Brien of Duagh, last King of Thomond (died 1579), and given to Donal's nephew, Connor O'Brien. Donogh O'Brien, Conor's son, may have been the one to move the seat of the family from Clonroad (Ennis) to Bunratty. He made various improvements to the castle including putting a new lead roof on it.During the Confederate Wars set off by the Irish Rebellion of 1641, Lord Forbes, commanding forces of the English Long Parliament, was allowed by the then Lord Barnabas O'Brien to occupy Bunratty in 1646. Barnabas did not want to commit to either side in the struggle, playing off royalists, rebels and roundheads against each other. He left for England, where he joined King Charles. Defence of the castle, whose position allowed those holding it to blockade maritime access to Limerick (held by the Confederates) and the river Shannon, was in the hands of Rear-Admiral Penn, the father of William Penn, founder of Pennsylvania. After a long siege, the Confederates took the castle. Penn surrendered but was allowed to sail away to Kinsale.Barnabas O'Brien died in 1657, but had apparently leased out the castle to one \"John Cooper\", likely the same person married to M\u00e1ire n\u00ed Mahon of Leamaneh Castle, widow of another O'Brien, Conor (died 1651). Bunratty Castle remained property of the O'Briens and in the 1680s the castle was still the principal seat of the Earls of Thomond. In 1712, Henry, the 8th and last Earl of Thomond (1688\u20131741) sold Bunratty Castle and 472 acres (191 ha) of land to Thomas Amory for \u00a3225 and an annual rent of \u00a3120. Amory in turn sold the castle to Thomas Studdert who moved in ca. 1720.The Studdert family left the castle (allowing it to fall into disrepair), to reside in the more comfortable and modern adjacent \"Bunratty House\" they had built in 1804.For some time in the mid-19th century, the castle was used as a barracks by the Royal Irish Constabulary. In 1894, Bunratty was once again used by the Studdert family, as the seat of Captain Richard Studdert. In the late 19th century, the roof of the Great Hall collapsed.In 1956, the castle was purchased and restored by the 7th Viscount Gort, with assistance from the Office of Public Works. He reroofed the castle and saved it from ruin. The castle was opened to the public in 1960, sporting furniture, tapestries and works of art dating to around 1600.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nChristopher Lynch, Bunratty Castle, Volume 41 of The Irish Heritage Series, Eason 1984, ISBN 0900346566.\n\n\n== External links ==\nShannon Heritage website\nA picture showing the castle before its 1950s restoration\nNational Inventory of Architectural Heritage: Bunratty Castle\nNational Inventory of Architectural Heritage: Bunratty Bridge\nNational Inventory of Architectural Heritage: Bunratty House\nNational Inventory of Architectural Heritage: Bunratty Castle Hotel",

          "We visited Bunratty as a family group, 4 adults 3 children + 1 baby, it was a fantastic day out, every effort has been made for social distancing to be implemented and there are sanitising stations throughout. There's something for all the family and really is worth a visit. I",
          "Enjoyed a lovely afternoon here today with our young family. Staff were all lovely, especially the schoolmaster & doctor. Made a great effort chatting with our kids. A great day out",
          "Absolutely worth visiting place near Limerick. Great for a family with small kids. Could be more interactive and have a bit more animals for smallies or perhaps home-made snacks locally produced.",
          "You are never too old to visit this fantastic folk park! Even though our children are now in their 20s and we were away for a short break we all really enjoyed the experience and highly recommend! Such a great way to spend half a day. Thank you.",
          "Our tour group with Gate 1 Travel stopped here one afternoon as we were travelling throughout Ireland. Bunratty Castle and Folk Park offer a unique insight into Irish life around the turn of the century. My husband and I enjoyed the many sights, sounds and scents of this",
          "We didn't spend much time in the Folk Park since we had banquet reservations, but we had about an hour to kill beforehand and this was the perfect way to do so. It was great to walk through the Folk Park and see what society looked like in Ireland at various points in history. I",
          "So when I was researching where to go when in Ireland this spot came up quite a bit so we stopped on our way from Cork to the Cliffs of Moher with our 2 little ones (1 and 3). The castle itself was very cool, it is re-created to look as though it might have been when it was",
          "There is no refund even when they cancel on you. Understandable why they cancelled during a pandemic, but was of no fault of our own. They did offer for us to reschedule in the next 12 months, but we were on vacation and cannot just hop on a plane to go back just anytime.",

          "We went in early March and it would have been great except half the stuff was closed. Only one costumed village person, almost all the houses and stores in the village center were closed, and Bunratty house was closed. It looks like they normally have a weaver demonstrating a",

          "We went here on a Sunday trip from county Laois. It was a beautiful place. The cafe on site was amazing with plenty of treats. The appletart is well worth it!!!!",
          "We spent the morning wandering in silence and awe. The buildings have so much history in them that one can almost see the ghosts of figures past. I loved the fairy houses and walking beneath the arches of tree lined roads. I only wish that I had had some extra time to spend",
          "We weren't planning a stop at the castle, so we took a spontaneous turn at the off ramp. And so glad we did! The castle is stunning with beautiful gardens too!",
          "4 of us all adults visited here on a cold and blowy sunday, 13.50 euros to get in which is well worth the price, the castle is very nice and well restored many many steps so not suitable for the elderly disabled etc, my legs are hurting today but well worth it, the folk village",
          "Visited here before and was really delighted with the experience, so we decided to come here again. Was a real memorable occasion! Loved the folk village and again we saw our wolfhound friends! Was really great to see the farm animals. Although nothing had changed, I feel that",
          "Really interesting castle which you get to roam freely. It was great to see how the rooms had been set up, really gives the impression of how it may have been back in its day. The folk park is nice to walk around, but needs more signage of how to navigate it and find the way to",
          "We did not get to spend any time at the folk park, but ourselves and another couple got tickets to the Feast which happens after hours at the Park. It was a phenomenal experience, and we had such a great time watching the performance, and enjoying the delicious food. I",

          "The castle was the first we have seen on our visit to Ireland ... it was very interesting to see the small winding staircases and then large rooms they would open into. The village was totally closed when we went and the Bunratty house was also closed which was disappointing as",
          "This is a fantastic day out. The castle itself is so well preserved and kept in Immaculate condition. The grounds are beautiful with so many amazing buildings to wander in and out of at your leisure. We had a bite at the cafe beside the entrance ticket booth which was lovely.",

          "No comparison to for example Blarney Castle and Gardens. This is an expensive theme park type of experience, short on history and more interested in ice skating, playgrounds, and chook pens. Don;t bother if you are interested in Irish history.",
          "Visited here on a recent trip to Limerick and it was lovely. Even the rain didn\u2019t dampen our fun. Reasonably priced. \u20ac13.25 per adult and our Son was free entry. Loads to see, even before you get to the castle.",
          "A lovely restored castle and garden grounds. Great history and tour guides know their stuff. the smell of the fires makes you feel like you stepped back in time. Great place to take children too. we were lucky enough to see baby lambs. With the path being indoors and outdoors, I",

          "This is our seventh visit to Santa Bunratty.. so we have always returned based on a very positive experience and lovely atmosphere and staff. However this year we were very very disappointed. Paid \u20ac160 of our hard earned money for our family of six , not cheap and in fact it\u2019s",
          "The truth is that, as my record shows, I wouldn\u2019t normally bother with reviews, but in this case, I feel I have to. Before I get to it, I want to point out that I had no issue with the park\u2019s set up, it was lovely actually, with a string of mini activities for the kids to enjoy.",
          "Bunratty was fantastic for my son and I. We both really enjoyed the old village so much. My son is very interested what it was like in the old times. Some of the old houses were brilliant to see. The playground was ok and the ice cream was nice. Well worth the trip down to see",
          "Very very disappointed with our Santa Experience in Bunratty today. Booked for 2pm, was told twice to go away into the park for half an hour that things were running late. Very disorganised and chaotic. Went back after amusing the kids as best I could to see that we were still",
          "Went to see santa with the kids. Second year doing so and same as the first it was really busy. It was late enough and we didn't make use of the park as we normally do. Go during the day to see the animals and enjoy the grounds. Staff were lovely as always. The only downfall is",
          "Having never visited a castle before, I decided to visit this one as I was staying in a hotel nearby. I bought my ticket online and arrived right at the 9am on a weekday. The good thing was that I basically had the entire place to myself for an hour. There were no other",

          "Some people say this is a bit kitschy but we enjoyed it. We almost stayed for the banquet but didn't. The castle is small but in good condition to visit. The grounds are nice to walk with bungalows and animals. Seeing the Irish wolfhounds was nice - boy are they huge!",
          "We had a great time here .The selection of things to see was fantastic. The castle it self was amazing the history in the rooms. There are alot of steep stones steps up to some if the towers and bedrooms so I wouldn't advise bringing under 8 up there as it was quite steep at",

          "Left my girlfriend in the dungeon, so good to have some peace and quiet on the journey home! Would definitely visit again to check up on her",
          "This is an excellent tourist attraction, the castle is amazing and the grounds are lovely would highly recommend a visit",
          "Visit to the Castle and Folk Park was very enjoyable. Family friendly with activities for children also. Had the Medieval dinner at the castle and it was great. Entertainment was enjoyable and meal was delicious.",
          "On a driving tour around the Republic of Ireland and decided to visit Buntratty castle. Was surprised by the number of exhibits in the folk park. Well laid out and very interesting and educational. Castle had a lot of narrow stairs which might be difficult for the elderly or",
          "We spent a few enjoyable hours here as part of a tour of the area and we were pleasantly surprised by how much there was to see and do. We did wander aimlessly at first without consulting the map, which was a mistake, because we just ended up going around in circles, so my",
          "Well worth the time to tour the castle and grounds. Better than expected. Tour the inside and then go to the local pub.",
          "We really enjoyed the castle. It was fun to be able to climb the towers to the roof and observe the upper rooms. Worth the price. The village was winding down because we were there late in the day, would likely ha ve been better to view earlier when more staff was on site.",
          "Went for the evening banquet, and it was marvelous. The food was delicious, and the entertainment was topnotch. When the sharpest played her solo, you could have heard a pin drop. Just a fabulous evening!!!",
          "We visited several castles on our trip to Ireland, but this was by far the best and the most \"authentic\" medieval castle experience. Most of the castle is true to the period and really gives you a sense of what it would be like living here in the 15th and 16th centuries. They",
          "Bunratty was recommended to us by several of the people we met over the course of our trip and I'm glad we took their advice. It's a delightful recreation of a 19th century Irish village, with plenty of animals to pet, and Bunratty Castle is great fun to tour; the narrow stairs",
          "This is a nice castle to tour. Although I would suggest you be in reasonable shape to do so, as you will be going up and down some very narrow and steep stairways and into some cramped quarters. The visitor center is nice too and filled will all sorts of tourist",
          "The Folk Park at Bunratty Castle is well worth a couple of hours' visit. One should take the time to walk into every house, building, or enclosure because there is something to offer in each one. Animals (especially ducks and chickens) roam around freely. You might even run",
          "This was a very nice place to visit on our travels in Ireland. We didn't go in the castle but walked around the area. This was a wonderful first stop in Ireland! It's always great to see a castle!",
          "A group of us were in the area on a Wild West Irish Tour. We enjoyed our day at the folk park. There were so many things to see and we enjoyed leisurely strolling through the different areas. My personal favorite was the fisherman's cottage. Everything was so authentic, you",
          "Four of us went to the feast at 8:45 PM on a Sunday night. I'll start by saying the actors do a great job. They work hard as actors, singers and servers during the feast. The entertainment is well done but a bit cheesy. It's like going to Medieval Times in North America without",
          "Went here for the afternoon on our way home and really enjoyed it. We had the dog with us but was allowed bring him with us although we weren't allowed inside the castle but the rest of the place was allowed. Loads to see and do and very dog friendly which was a nice change. Tea",
          "We (11 of us from 13 -72) arrived from Boston at 6:00 AM. We went to the hotel (Park Inn is highly recommended), ate breakfast, left our bags and picked up our rental car (would NOT recommend Hertz). From there we arrived at Bonratty a little before it opened. It was a",
          "Plan over 2 hours for your visit. Start at Bunratty Castle, a 15th century tower complete with original furniture and decoration. Afterwards you can walk around the Folk Park and drop in the various cottages, huts and other buildings and see how people on the Emerald Island",

Lots to see, you\u2019re able to look back in time to days past, seeing a little of what life was like for rural people. From",
          "Take in the history, the site has a great story to tell and it would be a shame for the negatives experienced today to stop you visiting. Very corporate, but that would be in line with the commercial company\u2019s mission statement. This is not a charity or not for profit",
          "Interesting castle. Set out differently to other castles I have been to in the past. Each turret is different. If you can\u2019t do stairs then give the castle a miss. The stair cases are winding and the steps vert small in some places. A god visit for a few hours..",
          "Well worth the drive and a stunning midevil castle that is very much intact. Not a place to go for people who are older and not able to to very small winding stairs but the grounds are great and a fun place if you have small children.",
          "This was the first visit of our 1 week holiday in Ireland and we could not have started better! The castle is well restorated in a realistic manner, looks very good and the folk park is lovely. We spent more than 3 hours here and could have stayed even longer. Highly reccomended",
          "We hosted French visitors here last summer and this attraction was definitely one of the best ways to spend a day! We started the day by visiting the folk park which the younger children loved due to all the animals and various attractions. That night we returned to the banquet",
          "Great music, good performers and the food is just so so. Mead is not what I would call a delicious drink, but it is an experience. I'd much rather have a good cold Miller Lite. The entertainment is well worth your effort",
          "Having visited here many years ago with my parents, I wanted to bring my children here also. They found it interesting and could relate to what they were being taught in school about medieval and our no so distant past. Castle and folk park were well laid out and younger kids",
          "Visited this place years ago when my children were small so decided to come back again now they are older and it is still as good, its like stepping back in time. The whole place has a good feel to it and staff are friendly and welcoming overall a good day out.",
          "We were told to skip this, that it was \u2018touristy\u2019. We were so glad that we didn\u2019t listen! Bunratty Castle and Folk Park was informative and fun and beautiful! The garden flowers were in full bloom. The grounds are kept clean and trimmed nicely. I spent a while sitting on one",
          "My wife, daughters (8 & 5) and I visited Bunratty Castle and Park last weekend. Each area was numbered so it was easy to follow on the map we were. The girls loved the adventure of going from house to house. We would definitely recommend a trip to Bunratty.",
          "My teens and I got here around 3:30 coming from Dingle. We were going to the banquet later, and I was concerned we might not have enough time to enjoy the park first. However, a couple of hours was more than enough for adults/teens. The castle itself wasn't so impressive as",
          "This was our second visit here but first with a child. Our three year old climbed all the stairs in the castle by himself and had so much fun exploring! The playground is super and even had a zip line. We grabbed sandwich\u2019s at the pub in the village which were fine. Walked the",
          "The castle was quick , we showed up late in day. So dinner at castle starting. But it was a castle cute to see. We loved the animals and folk park. I really think Bunratty was worth the visit wish we would have had more time. Oh Next time.",
          "Bunratty Castle and Folk Park were both included in our day trip to the Cliffs of Moher from Dublin. Bunratty Castle is a nice medieval castle filled with furniture and tapestries from the time period. You walk through a moat to get into the castle where you will be assembled",
          "Myself and my Partner visited Bunratty castle in May this year, we had heard it was a good place to visit (we live nearby in Limerick), but had never been. Firstly the staff are very friendly, from the moment we came in the door we felt very welcome. It is a unique place, if",

          "This is a great day out for any age group. I visited years ago with my dad when my children were younger. Today I returned, sadly without my dad but with my now adult children. We had such a fab day. We were there all day and didn't feel the time pass as there is so much to see",
          "We went primarily to see the castle, but the whole park was very interesting and, in places, very attractive. It gave us a bit of insight into rural Irish life a century or more ago.",
          "Lots to see at the castle, there are a large number of thatched cottages in the grounds, showing you how different jobs gave you a different size and equipped cottage. You can walk into each one. There is also an old replica street of shops, pub and post office to wander around,",
          "Family trip. Castle itself very impressive but no real order for getting up and down the narrow stairs unlike blarney castle. The park itself needs to be a bit more interactive maybe we were there on a quiet day.",
          "It must be 20 odd years since we visited Bunratty. Initially I thought the entrance fee was a bit excessive. This was based on how I remembered the place all those years ago. I couldn\u2019t have been farther removed from the reality of how good Bunratty is now. We were blown away by",
          "We enjoyed everything about Bunratty Castle and its accompanying folk part, It is a perfect activity for families. The castle is quite complete, with furnishings, unlike so many that are ruins (though equally fascinating). Loved the village park. Especially liked the",

          "Great value for money and a proper discount for seniors. A tour of the castle and a lovely afternoon spent wandering in the folk park. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit. Try to go early in the morning to avoid the worst of the crowds.",
          "been here long time for a medieval dinner, but now visited the original castle and folk park. The castle is trule nicely medieval with the correct decoration and artefacts. The folk park is interesting as well, so visit the old original houses and also the georgian mansion to",
          "The adults and the two teenage boys enjoyed this outing. Not just the castle and the old thatched houses but the trip down memory lane for those of us born in the 70\u2019s! I would highly recommend this as a family day out, well worth a visit. Very educational too. We enjoyed a",
          "The Bunratty Castle and Folk Park is truly a wonderful re-creation of times past in Ireland and is a must for all visitors to the area - young and old. The Park is very tidy, well-kept and laid out in a manner that facilitates scenery, beauty and enjoyable rambling. Although",
          "I was worried about visiting today as rain was forecast, but happily it only sprinkled. Lovely gardens, nice village area, good castle. I may have just missed it somehow, but I found little interpretive help. No tour, no app. But it is interesting and beautiful just the same. I",
          "Was going to visit the folk park , saw that the entrance fee for one day would cost us 68.50 so joined for the year for 95 euro instead. Glad that I did. Brilliant day out , enjoyed by kids young and old. Looking forward to returning with visitors. You would easily spend the",
          "We stopped here for a day of exploring. Really enjoyed seeing the houses as they would have been about a hundred years ago. Very well set up. Lovely grounds. The castle is so interesting and the guides are knowledgeable. So glad that we stopped here. The cafe at the entrance was",
          "We just happened to find this place and it ended up being such a fun stop. Worth the money to walk through the castle but I had more fun watching the baby goats running around. It was raining but you are inside enough that it worked out fine.",
          "The castle was interesting but had a lot of steps up and down spiral staircases so after seeing the great hall we walked to the folk museum. The cottages a dressed with contemporary furniture and artifacts and are very interesting telling the history of the people who worked the",
          "We did not have time to tour Bunratty's castle and folk grounds; however we did sign up for the \"Late Dinner in the Medieval Castle\" which started at 8:45 p.m. The experience and the entertainment was great. This was the first time we ate with only a knife - don't worry, the",
          "Don't be turned off by what would appear to be a tourist trap. Very interesting buildings with exhibits that bring the history to life. The castle was fascinating as it showed more as a living environment than a defensive fort. Worth the entrance fee. You could probably skip the",
          "We only got an opportunity to walk around the grounds of the folk park after it was closed, and prior to our Traditional Irish meal on site. However, we did enjoy walking around, and although the buildings were closed, it was still great to read the plaques on all of the",
          "We visited this as a part of a tour, so I was unsure as to how good it would be. It was great. The centerpiece is the 600 year old castle. It's relatively small and spartan. So don't expect a royal palace. It does have some interesting tapestries and furnishings from various",
          "Although the park doesn't cover a huge area, and therefore distances to be walked are not too excessive for most, there is a tremendous amount to occupy a family here for an entire day. I particularly liked that there is a suggested route through the folk park which ensures that",
          "We visited Bunratty Castle more for the folk park for the kids (11 and 14). As our kids have been to ethnographic villages in other countries, they were not overly impressed, but did enjoy the animals. Curious children who have not been to something like this will enjoy it and",
          "We spent hours of total relaxation as we wandered the attractive grounds that kept turning up surprises as we ambled along. It was a beautiful sunny day so we enjoyed our picnic (so can't comment on food services available). The children loved the fairy trail, animals,",
          "Castle and castle grounds are well kept. Staff is accommodating and friendly. Went to the dinner show . Meal was average but entertainment was excellent",
          "Great experience and great value, certainly put it on your to do list in Clare, the experience is a fantastic way of getting an insight into Irish life in years gone by... the staff are fantastic and very entertaining....",
          "Been to a few folk parks in ireland. Good way to see historic buildings. A way of life over about 200 years in a small area. Folk park had buildings from several areas of ireland. If you have short visit the folk parks are a good way to experience a lot in a short time. Great",
          "We thought we were only going to see a castle but when we realized the Folk Park was part of the admission price, we were pleasantly surprised. It is well laid out with the castle and farm buildings at one end and the town layout at the other end. The buildings all had small",
          "There are any number of similar folk museum's that I have visited throughout the world and Bunratty is one of my favourite's. Certainly one of my favourite places to visit in Ireland. So on the way to our two night accommodation near Ennis and then to visit the first day's play",
          "We visited the Bunratty Castle on June 30, 2019 on a friend's recommendation. We hadn't really researched the castle much prior to visiting, and were a little taken aback at the price of admission, but really wanted to see it. After entering, we learned it was so much more",
          "We stopped here on our way back to the airport and thoroughly enjoyed the experience The the village and grounds around it are viery interesting",
          "The castle is well preserved and contains many old pieces of furniture and has a nice display in the main hall. The stairs are not bad for most visitors and the village is worth a stroll through and is mostly shady for a hot day. The gift shop is nice and the staff is helpful.",
          "Every year I\u2019m in Ireland visiting family and of course shopping. Years ago I gave up trying to get my VAT back w the long airport lines. Today shopping at Blarney Woollen Mills in Bunratty park with their beautiful collection of ponchos, blankets, scarves, etc.., I went to pay",
          "We self guided ourselves through Bunratty Castle. This is not for front of heart as you climb up into four turrets along single file staircases but you really get the experience of what it must have been like. Folk park part would be great for kids- fairy trail and animals and",
          "We visited Bunratty yesterday as we had not been to the site in the last four years. Bunratty offers consistency and variety in its visitor experience. We did the tour of the folk park first as the forecasted rain had not yet arrived. The different homesteads are interesting to",
          "This castle is authentic, it is just the way it was way back when. The castle has 4 towers, and each tower has a narrow winding staircase. The Folk Park is also as authentic as possible, with houses and shops recreated to show how how both the wealthy and the peasants lived.",
          "The visit to Bunratty Castle was a spontaneous one, but I do not regret a minute of it. I loved walking in the park and around the castle. I really loved the fact that there were people there able to tell us a bit about the history and the origins of the exhibits. We will",
          "It's a little difficult to write this review as our experience was included as a part of a Gate 1 group tour and I'm not exactly sure what the specific cost would be if you were to walk up and pay your own entry fee. As we did not pay a specific fee, we had a pleasant enough",
          "This place had everything - a castle, old Irish houses, farm animals, a Church, an Estate House, a garden, a magical fairy village, a souvenir shop and a Caf\u00e9. There were even live entertainers dressed in medieval clothes/armor. Everything was well looked after. It was a great",
          "We spent the afternoon touring the castle and folk park before the evening's medieval feast. The park is extremely well done. The castle is one of the best for giving you an authentic experience from top to bottom. Great views at the top! The folk park gives you many insights to",
          "Great experience for kids 6,4 & 1 and even a bit of education in social history and architecture discretely slipped in! As well as the buildings there are lots of aninmals to see and pet (well looked after ones too) and lovely playground. The on site actors were fun and friendly",
          "A nice place to visit and learn about the repair of the castle. The whole place was interesting and the chowder was good.",
          "I loved this Castle. It was so much fun. Very hands on. You can climb to the top. Great views. The ground and village are very interesting!",
          "Probably our favorite castle of the entire trip. The rooftop view, while crowded at times on the stairs, was worth it. The folk park was also very informative and fun.",
          "Came here as a family of 5. 2 adults and three children who will be aged 7,6 and 4. I was a bit worried the kids would be to small so was pleasantly surprised when they loved it! They loved looking at all the different types of houses and the old street. They thought the castle",
          "Bunratty Castle is such an amazing place to visit, great restored 15th century Castle We really enjoyed the Folk Park, walking around the village really takes you back on time. Well worth a visit!!!",
          "Wonderful, beautiful grounds and gardens. The castle is amazing and he owes from above worth the climb. We had one person with us in a scooter, so he wasn\u2019t able to get into the castle or upper floor of the home, but everything else was accessible. Great for families with",
          "Fun day. A bit expensive for the medieval banquet because my granddaughter didn\u2019t like food (no options)",
          "Wow!! This place is amazing! You get to see the castle with furnishings like they had during it\u2019s glory days. The village is phenomenal with so much to learn. Highly recommend for anyone with children or history lovers.",
          "The castle is nice and has been preserved well. You can explore a lot of the castle and even go to the top to get some great views. The staff are very friendly. The folk park is nice and gives an indication about what ireland would have looked like in the past. They also have",
          "Enjoyed the night but expensive and geared to the American market . Food was lovely even if not as Irish as it should be . Music and singing again very much to keep the American market happy.",
          "Bunratty was a great experience. The tours are self-guided and an easy to read tour pamphlet is provided. There is more to the tour than just the castle. The village reenactment is great for families and full of information. The tour took roughly and hour, but we did go pretty",
          "We toured the Village and really enjoyed viewing the well preserved cottages, stores and farm areas. The park grounds are well tended, the flowers in full spring bloom were so pretty to see and enjoy.",
          "Had a lovely afternoon with local family. Good castle visit and great replica houses. Could spend all day here but ran out of time. Great for young families.",
          "This place is a bit off the beaten path, but well worth it. We spend about 2 hours walking through the village and the castle. Great for school age children. They had animals, a faerie garden, and old houses and buildings to visit. The castle is in great shape and a very",
          "Have been here before a couple of times but always love visiting. Very interesting and lovely to walk around. Good facilities. Well worth a visit.",
          "Our taxi driver from the airport recommended this for our free day on our own before we joined our tour. The Castle and Folk Park are well done. Interesting to see different period Irish buildings from different counties. Take at your own pace, and a couple places to stop",
          "Really enjoyed the replica of an Irish Village. I wish in the castle itself that the gentleman dressed in costume in the Hall would have given an English tour and told the history of the castle. As we were leaving there appeared to be a spanish speaking representative giving a",
          "We enjoyed walking around the park. The castle is nice; kids would love it. There is a guide in costume to tell you some of the history. Kids love the dungeon--not too cool but just the thought of going down the stairs. Lots of winding stairs and castle-like furniture/settings.",
          "This banquet event at Bunratty castle does not get enough reviews. FANTASTIC NIGHT. A must do. We are an international conference and they accommodated and ENTERTAINED over 200 of us, with 1st class service, delicious traditional Irish food all with a smile on their face. Let\u2019s",
          "We enjoyed our visit. Lots of charm. Good music and nice grounds. I would budget about 3 hours for a visit. Loved the banquet (which is a separate ticket).",
          "We put this on our itinerary because we had 3 kids (8,8,4) with us and saw how family friendly this appeared. It did not disappoint. We arrived in time to see the Wolfhounds come out and go for a walk, then visited with the pigs, chickens, ducks, calves, horses, and goats. The",

          "We really enjoyed touring the castle and walking around the folk park as a family. Kids 10 and 13. The folk park is well maintained and affords many opportunities to learn something new about life in Ireland during this time period. It is a wonderful stop if you have a couple",
          "There were so many gardens and animals to see. Our kids (8 & 1) loved the fairy trail. We enjoyed stopping for ice cream and seeing the little shops. The highlight was the castle. So fun to see a real castle. Only complaint is that it was tough to do with a baby. The rest of the",
          "Very interesting ! First time in a real castle and not disappointed. We learned alot from the reason the stairs are steep and curved to why there were tortoise shells hanging in the kitchen. The farmers cottage and grounds were neat too. Baby goats, roosters, turkeys..oh my!",
          "What a beautiful castle. It is well maintained and the grounds are also. The folk park has something for everyone. Each building has a story and the town that comes together when you enter is just amazing! I highly recommend that you see this one. I can see why it is top 10",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed our stop at Bunratty Castle and Folk Park. It needs to be on your list when castle stalking in Ireland. Loved that the tapestries and other elements are original and authentic. There are many shopping and eating opportunities nearby. Parking and the entrance",
          "Take the kids or visiting friends to Bunratty 2-3 times a year and it never fails to make me feel happy. Today was no different. The staff are all very friendly and good at their job. My only reason to reduce a point this time is because the enormous black rooster (an austrlorp",
          "Great tour, very interesting area and history. Great view from the top of the castle, worth the climb",
          "I read in the guidebook that this castle and folk park were too commercial. I might agree about the park, but not the castle. It's been well restored with careful consideration to authenticity. It gives you a good idea of what living in a medieval castle would have been like,",
          "Very informational. The castle seems to be in good shape and has beautiful views from the top. Lots of wonderful winding stairways to explore.",
          "The castle itself was sort of a typical Irish Castle. The tour was good, but there were several large groups that were non-English speaking, so we sort of avoided that to be able to see things at our own pace. The interior is nicely restored, and the village around the castle",
          "By the time I reached the park, I was already quite cross! There is no sign to tell you where to turn, so I was led back onto the motorway and had a ten mile round trip to get back again. When I mentioned this I was asked \"didn't you see the castle?\" !! I have been to folk",
          "Bunratty was the best castle we saw. I was not disappointed. It was a residential castle so a lot to see and learn. Unlike King John\u2019s Castle that was a guarding castle where there wasn\u2019t much to se. I am glad we went",
          "I had no idea how big this park and castle were. Very well done and kept up. Make sure you stop at the Tea Room and have some of their pastry. Try to Tour the Castle first. It closes before everything else.",
          "So many displays in the Folk Park remind me of my younger days, the thatched roofs, turf fire with fire-crane over, the old farm implements and accessories. These are highlights of any visit together with a tour of the castle. It never ceases to amaze how the inhabitants climbed",
          "We started in the castle and were taken round by a guide who told us all about the castle's history. We were warned in advance that some of the steps were steep and some of the visitors in our group couldn't manage to get up the narrow staircases. The Folk Park was very",
          "Bunratty Castle is a great spot to wander within. You are able to wind your way up and down spiral stone staircases to enjoy the view from up high. There are animals and cottage to view surrounding the castle and plenty of shops and eateries. Overall, it is full of nostalgia",
          "This was a wonderful afternoon. You can tour the castle and they have the grounds set up like a period village with all the cottages and gardens. Very much enjoyed this stop. Plan about 3 hours to see everything.",
          "We had a group of 24 and toured the castle together. The guide was informative and patient with us. History was pretty cool. Lots of shops and a village park. Lots of good stuff in welcome center restaurant was a pleasant surprise. Chocolate chip cookies we\u2019re great",
          "Went because we had no plans and it was amazing. Make sure to see the whole grounds and experience the animals. Places to grab a pint and/or tea.",

          "Bunratty castle and grounds could be covered in half a day or less. The castle itself was the focal point of my trip. The whole family loved it. Multiple spiral stone stairwells take you up into the castle for a realistic understanding of what castle life must have been like.",

        "wiki": "Thomond Park is a stadium in Limerick in the Irish province of Munster. The stadium is owned by the Irish Rugby Football Union and has Munster Rugby, Shannon RFC and UL Bohemian RFC as tenants. Limerick FC played home games in Thomond Park from 2013 to 2015 in the League of Ireland while the Markets Field was being redeveloped. The capacity of the stadium is 25,600 following its large-scale redevelopment in 2008.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe stadium holds a special place in rugby due to its own unique history and atmosphere. The stadium is famed for its noise during play and the complete silence while home and away players are kicking for goal. Munster also retained an intimidating 12-year unbeaten run at Thomond in the Heineken Cup\u2014running from the competition's start in 1995 until 2007 when the Leicester Tigers broke the streak with a 13\u20136 win. It is at Thomond Park that Munster celebrated their 12\u20130 victory over the All Blacks in 1978.\n\n\n=== Pre redevelopment ===\nThomond Park (named after the medieval kingdom of Thomond) originally consisted of two pitches, the main pitch and a training pitch. The main pitch was bounded on all sides by terracing with a stand above the west terrace. The training pitch was behind the west stand with the Shannon R.F.C. pavilion in the southwest corner of the ground. The UL Bohemian R.F.C. pavilion was within the west stand.\nTraditionally, the former terracing and four sides of the pitch had local nicknames, however they have since fallen out of local parlance. The most famous of these was the east terrace, which was known among fans as the \"Popular side\", this sat opposite the \"Stand side\", joining the \"City End\" (South Terrace) with the \"Ballynanty End\" (North Terrace). The \"Popular side\" gained notoriety in local rugby folklore for the colourful comments that can be heard emanating from local wags and alickadoos in the direction of the pitch, occasionally drawing reaction from players and officials, to the amusement of other attendants.The highest pre-redevelopment official attendance in Thomond Park was 18,000 people and occurred in 1992 in a local derby in the All-Ireland League between clubs Shannon RFC and Garryowen FC. Munster's average league attendance for the 2013\u201314 Pro12 season was 12,334\n\n\n=== Redevelopment ===\n\nIn 1998 and 1999, following the introduction of the professional era, the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) spent several million pounds on floodlighting, terracing, toilets, medical facilities and a new pitch for the ground. In January 2006, the Munster Branch of the IRFU made offers to buy some adjacent houses to expand the stadium. In March 2006 the IRFU and Munster Rugby announced that Thomond Park was unanimously selected for the site of the branch's new stadium, and in May 2006 the design for the re-development was unveiled. Work started in early 2007, and the project was completed for a re-opening in Autumn 2008.\nThe principal elements of the project saw the erection of two new stands adjacent to the existing main pitch, with a seating capacity of 15,100 and terrace capacity of 10,530, or 25,630 in all.It was thought that Thomond Park would be renamed in a sponsorship deal, following its redevelopment. However, it was confirmed in February 2008 that the name Thomond Park would remain the same, with naming rights being sold for the individual stands instead.\n\n\n=== Atmosphere ===\nThomond Park is well known for its atmosphere. During a rugby match, the home fans can be heard singing songs such as \"The Fields of Athenry\" and \"Stand Up and Fight\". These two songs play a vital role in Munster rugby as they are Munster's anthems. Donal Spring, one of the heroes of 1978, credits the spectators for its unique ethos: \"What's so special about Thomond Park? The crowd. Simply the crowd. The atmosphere is electric. Of all the places I've played, playing with Munster at Thomond Park is what I\u2019ve enjoyed most.\"The home crowd is also famous for its silence when a team's kicker is kicking for goal. This has been known to put the away team's kicker off, although it is done out of respect.\nIn August 2013 Thomond Park was awarded the title of 'Best Rugby Stadium in the World' following a vote by rugby supporters across the globe.\n\n\n=== International matches ===\nThomond Park has hosted five Ireland internationals. The results are as follows:\n\nIt also hosted a 1999 Rugby World Cup Pool 5 match between Australia and United States on 14 October 1999. Australia won 55\u201319.\n\n\n=== Other sporting fixtures ===\nLimerick F.C. played Shamrock Rovers in the League of Ireland Shield and BSC Young Boys in the European Cup in 1960 and Torino in the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1971 in Thomond.\nLimerick F.C. played all their Airtricity League Premier League home fixtures for the 2013 season at Thomond Park.\nThey also have played Manchester City FC twice in friendlies in 1992 and 2012The Republic of Ireland national football team played two international friendlies in Thomond during the construction of the Aviva Stadium. The first, on 12 August 2009 against Australia drew a crowd just above 19,000. Australia won 3\u20130. Ireland played and defeated South Africa 1\u20130 at Thomond on 8 September 2009 to a crowd of 11,300.\nThe Irish heats of the 2011 Special Olympics World Summer Games took place over four days here in June 2010.On 5 November 2011, the stadium hosted its first Rugby league game when Ireland took on France.\nOn 9 November 2013, Thomond Park hosted Ireland's 2013 Rugby League World Cup Group A match with Australia.It hosted an International Champions Cup match between Internazionale and Celtic on 13 August 2016 with Internazionale winning 2-0.\n\n\n=== Concerts ===\nElton John \u2013 6 June 2009\nRod Stewart \u2013 4 July 2009\nP!nk with guest Butch Walker \u2013 20 June 2010 \u2013 Funhouse Summer Carnival Tour\nBob Dylan with guests David Gray, Seasick Steve & Alabama 3 \u2013 4 July 2010\nThe Cranberries \u2013 9 June 2010 (Special Olympics opening ceremony \u2013 their first performance in their native city for over 15 years)\nJLS - 26 June 2011 with guest Olly Murs - JLS Tour\nBruce Springsteen \u2013 16 July 2013 \u2013 Wrecking Ball Tour\n\n\n== Attendances ==\nThe highest pre-redevelopment official attendance in Thomond Park came in 1992 when a local derby in the All-Ireland League between clubs Shannon RFC and Garryowen FC saw an attendance of 18,000 people.

At this point on the Shannon it is wide and shallow with many wooded islands which provide varied views and support for the piers. The deck is supported by two underslung catenary cables. Financed through a Public-private partnership, construction was undertaken by Eiffel Constructions Metalliques and completed in November 2007 at a cost of \u20ac12 million.  At 350 metres it is the longest pedestrian bridge in Ireland.\n\n\n== Awards and commendations ==\nRIBA European Awards and Institution of Structural Engineers winner structural awards 2008 (Pedestrian Bridges).

        "wiki": "The Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer (Latin: Congregatio Sanctissimi Redemptoris; CSsR), commonly known as the Redemptorists, is a religious congregation of the Catholic Church, dedicated to missionary work and founded by Alphonsus Liguori at Scala, near Amalfi, Italy, for the purpose of labouring among the neglected country people around Naples. Members of the congregation are Catholic priests and consecrated religious brothers and minister in more than 100 countries.\nThe Redemptorists are especially dedicated to Our Mother of Perpetual Help and were appointed by Pope Pius IX in 1865 as both custodians and missionaries of the icon of that title, which is enshrined at the Redemptorist Church of St. Alphonsus Liguori in Rome. Many Redemptorist churches are dedicated to her.\n\n\n== Foundation and development ==\n\nAlphonsus Liguori was deeply moved by the plight of the poor living in Naples and the surrounding area and established his community with the aim of providing spiritual nourishment. Amongst his companions was Gerard Majella. In 1748 Alphonsus petitioned Pope Benedict XIV, to allow him to establish a congregation to minister to the poor in the area around Naples. Benedict agreed and the congregation was formed in 1749.\nWithin ten years of the foundation, communities had been established at Nocera, Ciorani, Iliceto, and Caposele. Due to political complications, there was an initial difficulty with the houses in the Papal States being separated from those in the Kingdom of Naples, but this was overcome in 1793 and the congregation soon opened houses in Sicily and other parts of southern Italy.The congregation was soon to move beyond the borders of present-day Italy. In 1785 two Austrians, Clemens Maria Hofbauer and Thaddeus H\u00fcbl joined the Redemptorists. In 1786 Hofbauer and H\u00fcbl went to Warsaw in Poland where the papal nuncio gave them responsibility for the parish of Saint Benno; their mission thrived until the community was expelled in 1808. In 1793, Hofbauer turned his sights on establishing communities in Germanic lands.  Soon houses were opened in the south at  Jestetten, Triberg im Schwarzwald, and Babenhausen. In 1818, a house was established in Switzerland at the abandoned Carthusian monastery in La Valsainte.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nIn 1826, at the request of the government of Austria, the Redemptorists established a community in Lisbon, Portugal, with the purpose of ministering to German speaking Catholics. Other houses quickly followed in German-speaking areas: Mautern an der Donau (1827), Innsbruck (1828), Marburg (1833), Eggenburg (1833) and Leoben (1834).\nThe congregation also rapidly expanded into Belgium with communities at Tournai (1831), Sint-Truiden (1833), Li\u00e8ge (1833) and Brussels (1849). A community was even established in the, at the time somewhat anti-Catholic, Netherlands when a house was opened in Wittem in 1836. The revolutions of 1848 which swept over Europe caused much upheaval, and the Redemptorists were expelled from Switzerland and Austria and were at risk elsewhere.\nThe congregation thrived throughout the remainder of the 19th century; in 1852 there were four provinces and by 1890 this had increased to twelve with communities having been established in Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, England, Scotland, Spain and Suriname. The 20th century saw the continuation of expansion to where the congregation created new provinces, vice provinces and missions in every decade and established a network of lay associates and volunteers who work with the Redemptorists to bring the Gospel to the poor.\n\n\n== Apostolate ==\nRedemptorists are essentially a missionary society although their ministry is not confined to developing nations. According to their rule they are \"to strive to imitate the virtues and examples of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer consecrating themselves especially to the preaching of the word of God to the poor\". Their labours consist principally in missions, retreats, and similar exercises. As of 2019 there are approximately 5,500 Redemptorists in 82 countries throughout the world.\n\n\n=== Preaching and parochial missions ===\nAlphonsus Liguori wanted his companions to be itinerant preachers of the Word of God. Traditionally, this has been the mainstay of the Redemptorists as they are well known for conducting parochial missions.  The purpose of these parochial missions and the homilies preached by the Redemptorists is to \"... invite people to a deeper love for God and a fuller practice of the Christian life.\" In accordance with the instructions of Liguori, preaching is to be down-to-earth and understandable to all who are listening.\n\n\n=== Shrines, sanctuaries and retreat houses ===\nIn order to advance their mission and provide places of pilgrimage, the Redemptorists administer several shrines, which draw hundreds of thousands of people, the best-known being in Brazil, Canada, Colombia, the Philippines, Rome, and Singapore. The congregation operates many retreat houses where people of all walks of life, Catholic or otherwise, can spend some time in reflection, either individually or in a group.Redemptorists are caretakers of the Byzantine icon of Our Mother of Perpetual Help, depicting the Blessed Virgin Mary with the Child Jesus and the instruments of the Passion, which was entrusted to them by Pope Pius IX. It is now enshrined in the Redemptorist Church of St. Alphonsus Liguori, Rome, and Redemptorists propagate devotion to Mary under this title.\n\n\n=== Other ministry ===\nAs with most religious congregations, the Redemptorists are also involved in other forms of ministry such as parishes, education, youth and social communication. In recent years the congregation has increasingly become concerned with matters of social justice; as the Generalate website states \"Redemptorists believe that the saving love of God touches the whole person and calls for the transformation of social injustice into respect for the dignity of all men and  women\". The Redemptorist religious province of Cebu in the Philippines have made a specific commitment in this regard: \"Moved by the poverty and dehumanised condition of our people, and encouraged by their faith and desire for justice ... We, the Redemptorists of the Province of Cebu, as an apostolic community dedicated through our vows, are called to respond to the urgent needs of our people, especially the most abandoned and the poor ...\"\n\n\n== Religious formation ==\nAfter an initial period of contact and discernment, the person seeking to enter the Redemptorists becomes a \"candidate\" and goes to live in one of the communities so that both sides might become better acquainted. This lasts about two years during which they learn about Redemptorist prayer, life, and ministry.Assuming that all goes well, the candidate then begins the novitiate, lasting a year. The novitiate year is crucial, for it is then \" ... that the novices better understand their divine vocation, and indeed one which is proper to the institute, experience the manner of living of the institute, and form their mind and heart in its spirit, and so that their intention and suitability are tested.\" Thus, the novices are given the opportunity for longer periods of prayer and spiritual reading as well as silence in order to reflect on the vocation God is offering and nature of their response. The spiritual development of the novice is of particular focus, especially through spiritual direction. During the novitiate the history and constitutions of the congregation are studied in depth.\nA simple profession is made at the end of the novitiate and the person officially becomes a member of the Redemptorists for \"By religious profession, members assume the observance of the three evangelical counsels by public vow, are consecrated to God through the ministry of the Church, and are incorporated into the institute with the rights and duties defined by law.\"  At this point it is normal to begin studying philosophy and theology at university level. During this time there is ample opportunity to experience a variety of ministries in which the Redemptorists are engaged both abroad and in the member's country of birth. Temporary vows are renewed annually.\nAt the end of this period of formation, which lasts for a minimum of three years perpetual profession (final vows) is made and ordination to the diaconate and presbyterate follows for those called to Holy Orders.As the academic programs come to an end, all Redemptorists in temporary vows are required to participate in a pastoral experience for a minimum of six months to a year, outside of a brother's home province.\n\n\n== Religious vows ==\n\nAs members of a religious congregation Redemptorists embrace the evangelical counsels, taking the three traditional religious vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. Poverty means that all possessions are held in common and that no member may accumulate wealth. Chastity means more than abstaining from sexual activity and its purpose is to make the religious totally available for service; it is also a sign that only God can completely fill the human heart. For a member of a religious congregation, obedience is not slavishly doing what one is told by the superior but being attentive to God's will by prayerfully listening to the voice of the person in charge. For the Redemptorist, the three vows challenge those values presented as being important by modern-day society.\nRecognising that the living out of the three traditional vows can be truly challenging, each Redemptorist takes a fourth vow, that of perseverance.\n\n\n== Organization ==\nThe Generalate is in Rome. The most fundamental unit of the Redemptorists is the local community in which members live together, combining their prayers, experiences, successes and failures, as well as any possessions for the service of the Gospel. Each community has a local superior who is chosen to exercise the ministry of leadership and the service of authority for the common good. The superior is assisted by a vicar and a group of advisors.\nLocal communities are organized into larger groups: provinces, vice-provinces, regions. A province is led by a provincial and his council, composed of elected members. In terms of governance, the members of each province elect representatives who gather in a Provincial Chapter. Vice-provinces usually look to a founding province to provide support in terms of personnel and finances until it is able to become self-sufficient. Otherwise, it enjoys the freedom and authority necessary to adjust matters to the particular needs of its mission.\nRegions and Missions are normally communities established in new missionary areas and they depend on the founding province or vice-province.\nThe Superior General convokes the General Chapter every six years. The General Chapter is the primary governing and representative body of the Redemptorists, carefully examining the mission of the congregation in accordance with the spirit of Alphonsus Liguori and its traditions. The day-to-day international affairs of the congregation are handled by the General Council, which is composed of a superior general and six consultors. The General Council is both a directive and executive body.\n\n\n=== Regions and provinces ===\nSouth Europe: 6 provinces and 2 regions\nNorth Europe: 8 provinces, 2 vice-provinces, 2 regions and 1 mission,\nNorth American Redemptorists are divided into five provinces (Baltimore, Denver, Edmonton-Toronto, Yorkton for the Ukrainian Greek Catholics, and Mexico) and one vice-province (Richmond). North America: 5 provinces, 1 vice-province and 4 regions.\nLatin America: 13 provinces, 11 vice-provinces, 4 regions and 2 missions.\nAfrica:  1 province, 5 vice-provinces, 2 regions and 5 missions.\nAsia-Oceania:\t6 provinces, 5 vice-provinces, 4 regions and 2 missions.\n\n\n== Regional development ==\n\n\n=== Africa ===\nIn 1899 the Belgian fathers were requested by their government to take charge of a number of missions in the Congo State, at that time a Belgian colony: Kinkanda, Kionzo, Kimpese, Matadi, Sonagongo and Lake Tumba.\nIn 1987 the Denver Province established a mission in Nigeria which was so fruitful that it soon became a vice-province. The members of the vice-province have made concerted efforts to involve the laity in their work. The Redemptorists also minister in Angola (1967); Burkina Faso; Ghana; Ivory Coast (1993); Madagascar (1967); Niger; Zimbabwe (established by the British Redemptorists in 1960 and revitalized in 1989)In 1990 the Indian Redemptorists began a mission in Kenya where there are several professed members.\nIn South Africa Redemptorists administer parishes in Cape Town, Rustenburg and Howick. There is also a convent of Redemptoristines sisters in Merrivale, KwaZulu-Natal. For the Redemptorists of Southern Africa \"... Justice and Peace is part and parcel of everything we are and do. In the South African context ... we are called by the poor to a simple life-style and we cannot avoid the struggle of the outcasts and oppressed of the townships and the desperate plight of the poor.\"In May 2011 a number of allegations of child sexual abuse by a member of the institute in South Africa were revealed on the RT\u00c9 programme Prime Time Investigates.Alan Shatter the Irish Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence has stated that\n\n I have been in touch with the Garda Commissioner about this matter who, of course, shares my concern at the revelations in the programme. The Superintendent in charge of the Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit is being appointed to examine the programme. In particular, he will examine whether any criminal behaviour was disclosed which can be pursued in this jurisdiction.\n\n\n=== Australia and New Zealand ===\n\nThe first house established was in Singleton, New South Wales, but during the summer heat missions were conducted in the cooler climate of New Zealand's dioceses. As Singleton was an unsuitable base, the community oversaw the building of a new monastery at Mount St Alphonsus, Waratah, New South Wales. It was opened on the founder's feast, 1887, just five years after the Redemptorists' arrival. In the first year at Waratah the community conducted 45 missions through New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. A new house in Ballarat followed in 1888 and work began on a new monastery in the suburb of Wendouree. It was officially opened in September 1893.\nWith the south now being cared for by the Ballarat community, those in Waratah looked north to Queensland and the first missions were preached there in 1889. Missions began in Brisbane and its surrounds, with their success convincing the Archbishop to extend the programme to the far flung country parishes.\nThe first structure that was purpose-built for the Redemptorists in New Zealand was St Gerard's Church in Wellington in 1908.In 1927, the Province of Australasia, which included Australia and New Zealand, was created. New Zealand became an independent province in 1970 and from New Zealand, the Redemptorists went to Samoa in 1972.The years after the Second World War were a time of rapid expansion. As well as ongoing participation in the development of the vice-provinces in the Philippines and in Singapore and Malaysia, further houses were opened in New Town in Tasmania and Townsville and Miami in Queensland. There were also communities established in New South Wales: Campbell's Hill, Concord, Fairfield West, Penrith and Yagoona.  In Victoria, there were communities at Balwyn Box Hill, Brighton, Wongarra and Yarraville.  In Melbourne, the order also conducted a psychotherapy clinic and Training Institute, Hofbauer Centre, from 1977 until 1998.\nMissionary activity continues to flourish across Australia. Through parochial missions, preaching, retreats, adult education, teaching in universities, social justice work, counselling, accompaniment of indigenous communities, chaplaincies, devotions to Our Lady of Perpetual Help, working with people on the margins of society and promoting the family through the Majellan magazine, Redemptorists have sought to highlight that people matter greatly to God. For the Australian Redemptorists, the issue of social justice \"... matters to the Redemptorists for it is at the core of our mission in the world.\"\n\n\n=== India ===\nThree Irish Redemptorists Mathew Hickey, Gerard McDonell and Leo O'Halloran from the Province of Dublin with great zeal and missionary dynamism set on a task to proclaim the Good News and arrived in the Island country of Sri Lanka in the year 1938. The long cherished dream of the Redemptorists to establish a foundation in India was actualized in the year 1940 when the first community was established in Bangalore in 1940.\nIt was Hugo Kerr, the Provincial Superior of the Province of Dublin who obtained permission from Monsignor Despartures, the Bishop of Mysore to establish a foundation in Bangalore. In the Lent of 1941 St. Gerard's House at John Armstrong Road became the First Permanent residence of the Redemptorists. On 1 October 1945 the Indian Redemptorist mission became a Vice-Province and Mathew Hickey was the first Vice-Provincial. And the next ten years (from 1945 to 1955) saw great structural developments with Mt. St. Alphonsus (MSA) being built which would be the permanent house of the Studentate (7 June 1951) and the much awaited Holy Ghost Parish was opened for public worship on 24 May 1953. It was during this time St. Alphonsus School with the help of Sisters of St. Joseph of Tarbes, began in the Students\u2019 wing of MSA. The school was later moved to Davis Road which stands till today catering to the education of the poor children who come from the vicinity of the area. In July 1964 Sadupadesa College on Hennur Road was built to house students who would study philosophy. It is now turned into a Juvenate which is the first stage of formation (as of 2015). In July, 2010 Holy Redeemer Parish was erected in Sadupadesa.\nThe Vice-Province of Bangalore grew steadily facing all odds and overcoming all obstacles to become the Province of Bangalore on 15 August 1972 and also took a momentous initiative in the year 1990 by establishing a Redemptorist community in Kenya, Africa. Now the mission has 7 indigenous priests along with the members of the province serving in the mission. The Province of Bangalore has also given birth to two other units, the Liguori Province of Kerala and the Vice-province of Majella along the western coast of India.As of 2011 there were some 260 Redemptorists in India, belonging to two Provinces, one Vice-Province, one Region and one Mission. The Region of Alwaye was established in 1992 and became a Province (Province of Liguori) in 2008. The Region of Mumbai was established in 1999 and was raised to the status of a Vice-Province in 2011. The Mission of Kenya began in 1990 and there are several perpetually professed Kenyan members.\n\n\n=== The Philippines ===\nThe first Redemptorists, belonging to the Irish province, arrived in Opon, Cebu, on 30 June 1906, setting up missions in Compostela, San Francisco and on the Camotes Islands. From 1914 to 1928 further communities were established, the most prominent being: Luzon (where the Redemptorists preached the first mission completely in Tagalog), Lipa, Iloilo, Tacloban and Cagayan de Oro on Mindanao.\nIn 1928, the Philippines was divided into two vice provinces, each under a different province\u2014the Cebu vice-province responsible for the Visayas and Mindanao under the Irish province; and the Manila vice-province responsible for Luzon under the Australian province, now headquartered at the National Shrine of Our Mother of Perpetual Help in Baclaran.\nThe Second Vatican Council (1962\u20131965) had a profound impact on the Redemptorist Congregation and this resulted in them pledging themselves more strongly to the poor and disadvantaged in imitation of Alphonsus Liguori. When the political and social upheavals came in the 1960s and 1970s the Filipino Redemptorists stood in solidarity with those seeking justice and equality for they were to \"... embrace the mission to proclaim by word and action, the Gospel of justice so that the poor's aspirations can be fully realised in Christ, the source of liberation.\"In 1996, the Cebu vice-province became an independent province, known as the Cebu Province.\n\n\n=== United Kingdom and Irish provinces ===\n\nRedemptorists arrived from Belgium in 1843, and the new province owed its great progress to Robert Aston Coffin, one of the band of converts associated with Cardinal John Henry Newman, Cardinal Henry Edward Manning, and William Faber in the Oxford Movement. Coffin was engaged in missions until he was appointed first provincial in 1865. During his administration new houses were founded in various parts of the United Kingdom, the house at Perth being the first Scottish monastery opened since the Reformation. By 1910, the province had eight houses: Clapham, Bishop-Eton, Monkwearmouth, Bishop's Stortford, Kingswood, Edmonton and a total membership of one hundred and twenty-three.Today the Redemptorists of Britain are engaged in a variety of ministries: the mission amongst the poor of Zimbabwe, a renewal centre at Kinnoull, Perth where people can spend time in prayer and reflection and parishes in Edinburgh, Birmingham, Liverpool and London. Their goal is \"to defend our joy in Jesus Christ and to bring to others Plentiful Redemption\"In 1898 the houses in Ireland were constituted a separate province with the provincial house at Limerick. On 25 March 1901, the foundation of the juvenate house at Limerick was laid. The province of Ireland then comprised four houses: Limerick, Dundalk, Belfast, and Esker. Today, the provincial house is located in Dublin with other communities being found in Belfast (Clonard Monastery and the parish of Saint Gerard), Cork, Dundalk, Athenry in Galway, Limerick and four houses are established. The Irish Redemporists are involved in parish ministry, youth work, Redemptorist publications and retreats. They also help staff  the missions in Cebu in the Philippines\n\n\n=== North American Province ===\n\n\n==== United States ====\n\nIn 1828 Mgr R\u00e9s\u00e9, Vicar-General of Cincinnati, visited Europe in search of priests. While at Vienna he secured three priests and three lay brothers; they arrived in New York on 20 June 1832 and began working amongst the people of northern Michigan.  In 1839 they were called to Pittsburgh to assume charge of the German congregation and from this time the care of German congregations became a prominent element of the Redemptorists in North America.The US province was erected in 1850 and one of the first tasks was the establishment of a seminary and the selection of a suitable place for a novitiate. Cumberland in Maryland, was chosen for the seminary and Baltimore for the novitiate. In 1868 the students were transferred to the new house of studies at Ilchester, Maryland and in 1907 the faculty and the students moved to Esopus, New York, on the Hudson River where a more spacious building had been erected.In 1882, the congregation sent priests to the Archdiocese of Washington and eventually established five parishes. In 1861 they opened a community in Chicago, Illinois. Soon after, due to the many successful missions they had given in the Archdiocese of St. Louis a house was opened at St. Louis.  In 1871 an important mission house was opened at Roxbury, Boston and was dedicated to Our Lady of Perpetual Help. When, in 1883, a new parish was formed, the fathers of the mission church took charge. (In 2009, its later basilica, of the same name, hosted the nationally televised funeral of Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy, attended by President Barack Obama, three former US presidents and first ladies, among other dignitaries.)\nFrom 1883 onward, the Redemptorists spread throughout most of North America and are present in a variety of states such as California in the west, Michigan and Illinois in the midwest, Washington, DC, and Baltimore in the northeast and Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas in the south.\nNorth American Redemptorists are involved in giving parochial missions, social justice, retreats, youth ministry, ministry to adults with special needs, bioethics, publication of religious materials and chaplaincy work as well as outreach to the Hispanic community, ministry amongst the poor, and helping to staff missions in the Caribbean The Denver Province owns Liguori Publications, which publishes books and Liguorian magazine.\n\n\n==== Canada and Caribbean ====\nIn 1874 the Redemptorists were called to St. Patrick's Church, Quebec, Canada, the only church in that city for English-speaking Catholics. In 1878 they became the custodians of the shrine of Ste-Anne de Beaupr\u00e9, near Quebec and then of St. Anne's, Montreal, a large parish in a very poor district of the city. Two other foundations were quickly established in Canada: Saint Patrick's, Toronto and Saint Peter's, New Brunswick in 1881 and 1884 respectively.\nCanada was made a vice-province in 1894, where four more houses were opened.

        "wiki": "Limerick (; Irish: Luimneach [\u02c8l\u032a\u02e0\u026am\u02b2(\u0259)n\u02b2\u0259x]) is a city in County Limerick, Ireland. It is located in the Mid-West Region and is also part of the province of Munster. With a population of 94,192 at the 2016 census, Limerick is the third-most populous urban area in the state, and the fourth-most populous city on the island of Ireland. The city lies on the River Shannon, with the historic core of the city located on King's Island, which is bounded by the Shannon and Abbey Rivers. Limerick is also located at the head of the Shannon Estuary, where the river widens before it flows into the Atlantic Ocean. Limerick City and County Council is the local authority for the city.\n\n\n== Geography and political subdivisions ==\nAt the 2016 census, the Metropolitan District of Limerick had a population of 104,952. On 1 June 2014 following the merger of Limerick City and County Council, a new Metropolitan District of Limerick was formed within the united council, which extended the city area. The Metropolitan District includes the city urban area and extends outwards towards Patrickswell in the west and Castleconnell in the east. The City Metropolitan Area however excludes city suburbs located within County Clare.\nLimerick is one of the constituent cities of the Cork\u2013Limerick\u2013Galway corridor, which has a population of 1 million people. It is located at a strategic position on the River Shannon with four main crossing points near the city centre. To the south of the city is the Golden Vale, an area of rich pastureland. Historically, much of the city's industry was based on this rich agricultural hinterland, and it is particularly noted for Limerick ham.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient and medieval history ===\nLuimneach originally referred to the general area along the banks of the Shannon Estuary known as Loch Luimnigh. The earliest settlement in the city, Inis Sibhtonn, was the original name for King's Island during the pre-Viking and Viking eras. This island was also called Inis an Ghaill Duibh, 'The Dark-(haired) Foreigner's Island'. The name is recorded in Viking sources as Hlymrekr.\nThe city dates from 812; however, history suggests the presence of earlier settlements in the area surrounding King's Island, the island at the historical city centre. Antiquity's map-maker, Ptolemy, produced in 150 the earliest map of Ireland, showing a place called Regia at the same site as King's Island. History also records an important battle involving Cormac mac Airt in 221 and a visit by Saint Patrick in 434 to baptise an E\u00f3ganachta king, Carthann the Fair. Saint Munchin, the first bishop of Limerick died in 652, indicating the city was a place of some note. In 812 the Vikings sailed up the Shannon and pillaged the city, burned the monastery of Mungret but were forced to flee when the Irish attacked and killed many of their number. The Normans redesigned the city in the 12th century and added much of the most notable architecture, such as King John's Castle and St Mary's Cathedral.In early medieval times Limerick was at the centre of the Kingdom of Thomond which corresponds to the present day County Clare, the Kingdom also included North Kerry and parts of South Offaly. One of the kingdom's most notable kings was Brian Boru, ancestor of the O'Brien Clan of Dalcassians. The word Thomond is synonymous with the region and is retained in place names such as Thomondgate, Thomond Bridge and Thomond Park.\n\n\n=== Late Renaissance/Early modern history ===\n\nLimerick in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was often called the most beautiful city in Ireland. The English-born judge Luke Gernon, a resident of Limerick, wrote in 1620 that at his first sight of the city he had been amazed at its magnificence: \"lofty buildings of marble, like the Colleges in Oxford\".During the civil wars of the 17th century the city played a pivotal role, besieged by Oliver Cromwell in 1651 and twice by the Williamites in the 1690s. The Treaty of Limerick ended the Williamite war in Ireland which was fought between supporters of the Catholic King James II (Jacobites) and the Protestant King William of Orange (Williamites). The treaty offered toleration to Catholicism and full legal rights to Catholics that swore an oath of loyalty to William III and Mary II. The Treaty was of national significance as it ensured closer British and Protestant dominance over Ireland. The articles of the Treaty protecting Catholic rights were not passed by the Protestant Irish Parliament which rather updated the Penal Laws against Catholics which had major implications for Irish history. Reputedly the Treaty was signed on the Treaty Stone, an irregular block of limestone which once served as a mounting block for horses. This stone is now displayed on a pedestal at Clancy Strand. Because of the treaty, Limerick is sometimes known as the Treaty City. This turbulent period earned the city its motto: urbs antiqua fuit studisque asperrima belli (an ancient city well studied in the arts of war).\nThe peaceful times that followed the turmoil of the late 17th century allowed the city to prosper through trade in the late 18th century. During this time Limerick Port established itself as one of Ireland's major commercial ports exporting agricultural produce from one of Ireland's most fertile areas, the Golden Vale, to Britain and America. This increase in trade and wealth, particularly amongst the city's merchant classes saw a rapid expansion of the city as Georgian Limerick began to take shape. This gave the city its present-day look including the extensive terraced streets of Georgian townhouses which remain in the city centre today. The Waterford and Limerick Railway linked the city to the Dublin\u2013Cork railway line in 1848 and to Waterford in 1853. The opening of a number of secondary railways in the subsequent decades developed Limerick as a regional centre of communications.  However, the economic downturn in the European conflicts of the French Revolution and Napoleonic eras, and following the Act of Union 1800, and the impact of the Great Irish Famine of 1848 caused much of the 19th century to be a more troubled period.\n\n\n=== 20th-century history ===\n\nThe Limerick boycott was an economic boycott waged against the small Jewish community for over two years in the first decade of the 20th century. It was accompanied by a number of assaults, stone throwing and intimidation, which caused many Jews to leave the city. It was instigated in 1904 by a Redemptorist priest, Father John Creagh.\nDuring the Irish War of Independence, the Limerick Soviet was a self-declared soviet that existed from 15 to 27 April 1919. A general strike was organised by the Limerick Trades and Labour Council, as a protest against the British Army's declaration of a \"Special Military Area\" under the Defence of the Realm Act, which covered most of Limerick city and a part of the county. During the strike a special strike committee was set up to print their own money, control food prices and publish newspapers.\nBy the mid-20th century, Limerick was characterised by economic stagnation and decline as many traditional industries closed or left the city. However, there were some success stories. In 1942 Shannon Airport (located in County Clare, 20 km west of the city) opened for the first time offering transatlantic flights. In 1959, Shannon Airport enabled the opening of the Shannon Free Zone which attracted a large number of multinational companies to the region. A long campaign for a third level educational institute to be located in the city finally bore fruit with the establishment of NIHE Limerick in 1969 which eventually became the University of Limerick in 1989.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nThe local government area of Limerick city is under the jurisdiction of Limerick City and County Council. The Council has responsibility for local services such as sanitation, planning and development, libraries, collection of motor taxation, local roads and social housing in the city. The council comprises elected ward Councillors with an appointed full-time CEO as the city (and county) manager. Local elections are held every five years and the Councillors annually elect a Cathaoirleach or chairman to chair the council. As of 2015, the Cathaoirleach was Cllr Liam Galvin from the Newcastle West electoral area. The 21 Councillors from the 3 electoral districts in the City Metropolitan Area also elect a mayor to represent the city. The Mayoral position is largely ceremonial and has much reduced responsibility following the merger of the Limerick local authorities. Although the Mayor is the city's first citizen, within the council the position is below that of the Cathaoirleach. The current mayor is Councillor Jerry O'Dea. Former well-known mayors include TDs Donogh O'Malley, Stephen Coughlan, Michael Lipper, Jim Kemmy and Jan O'Sullivan.Throughout most of the city's history; from 1197 when it gained its first charter, Limerick City had its own local government authority, Limerick Corporation later known as Limerick City Council. The council was one of the oldest in Ireland and was only exceeded in age by Dublin City Council. In October 2012 the Government of Ireland published Putting People First- Action Programme for Effective Local Government which set out Government policy for reforms across all the main areas of local government in Ireland. Among the recommendations was the merging of Limerick City Council with Limerick County Council. The changes came into effect on 1 June 2014 following the implementation of the Local Government Reform Act 2014.By the 1960s onwards the city had outgrown its boundary considerably; the city boundary was only altered slightly and never reflected the overall urban area of the city. A limited boundary extension on the city's north side in 2008 enlarged the city boundary by 1,020 hectares increasing the city's area by almost 50% and raising the population by an estimated 7,000. The previous boundary, encompassing 2,086 hectares, was delineated in 1950. Newer suburban districts such as Dooradoyle, Castletroy \u2013 including the University, Gouldavoher, and Raheen were continually administered to by Limerick County Council until the merger of the two authorities in June 2014. This local government structure in Limerick caused a number of inefficiencies, most notably in the area of planning. A number of suburbs such as Westbury and Parteen to the north of the city are governed by Clare County Council.\nFollowing the merger of the two authorities in 2014 a new Metropolitan District of Limerick City was set up that included the city urban area and also settlements close to the city such as Patrickswell and Castleconnell. The Metropolitan district returns 21 Councillors to Limerick City and County Council which in total has 40 Councillors returned from across Limerick City and County. The Limerick City Metropolitan District is divided into 3 wards or electoral areas which are; Limerick City East, Limerick City North and Limerick City South which elect eight, six and seven Councillors respectively.Following the 2019 local elections, Fine Gael was the largest party on the united authority with 13 seats followed by Fianna F\u00e1il with 12, Labour with 3, Sinn F\u00e9in and the Green Party (Ireland) with 2 each, the Social Democrats with 1 seat, and Independents and other parties the remaining 6 seats.For national D\u00e1il elections Limerick City is in the Limerick City constituency. From 2011, the constituency boundaries changed in accordance with the proposals of the Constituency Commission and the subsequent Electoral (Amendment) Act 2009. This changed the electoral boundaries from Limerick East and Limerick West to Limerick City and Limerick. Limerick city encompasses the city, the suburban areas of Castletroy and as far east as Castleconnell. It also includes part of south County Clare. The Limerick county constituency takes in most of the rest of the county. For European parliament elections Limerick is in South Ireland.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nLimerick's climate is classified as temperate oceanic (K\u00f6ppen Cfb). Met \u00c9ireann maintains a climatological weather station at Shannon Airport, 20 kilometres west of the city in County Clare. Shannon Airport records an average of 977 millimetres of precipitation annually, most of which is rain. Limerick has a mild climate, with the average daily maximum in July of 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) and the average daily minimum in January of 3 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F). The highest temperature recorded was 32.0 \u00b0C (89.6 \u00b0F) in June 2018, and the lowest \u221211.4 \u00b0C (11.5 \u00b0F) in 2010. Limerick is the cloudiest city in the state, averaging only 1,295 sunshine hours annually, 3.5 hours of sunshine every day. There are on average 62 days of no recordable sunshine, 6 days of thunder, 22 days of hail and 11 days of snow per year. Shannon Airport is located by the ocean at an elevation of 14 metres, so snow is less common at the station than in the city itself.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn 2014, Limerick became Ireland's inaugural National City of Culture, with a variety of artistic and cultural events occurring at locations around the city throughout the year.\nThe Limerick City Gallery of Art on Pery Square is the city's chief venue for contemporary art exhibitions. It is home to a permanent collection of Irish art, which shows works from the early 18th to 20th century. The gallery houses the National Collection of Contemporary Drawing founded by the artist Samuel Walsh in 1987. Limerick's major contemporary art event is EVA International, Ireland's Biennial of Contemporary Art. EVA International, centered mainly in the Limerick City Gallery of Art, is curated by varying guest curators and includes contemporary artworks by both international and Irish artists.The Lime Tree Theatre officially opened at the Mary Immaculate College campus in October 2012. The venue hosts theatre, music, comedy, traditional arts, schools' performances and conferences.The Belltable Arts Centre on O'Connell Street hosts local playwrights and drama productions. The University Concert Hall located in UL is a 1,000 seat venue and provides a large venue for national and international acts to visit the city. Limerick is also the home of street theatre companies, including \"The Umbrella Project\".\nLimerick's literature scene is supported by projects like the Limerick Writers' Centre, which was established in 2008 and runs a range of writing activities in the city. Limerick natives include Pulitzer Prize winning author, Frank McCourt; novelists Kate O'Brien, Michael Curtin, Kevin Barry and Donal Ryan. Poets from Limerick include Michael Hogan, Desmond O'Grady, and John Liddy.Other Limerick arts groups include Contact Studios, which provides individual studio spaces for visual artists; the Daghdha Dance Company, a contemporary dance company that has adopted a renovated church in John's Square, adjacent to St John's Cathedral, as a performance space); the Fresh Film Festival, which is held each spring, and includes films made by young people (7\u201318 years); Impact Theatre Company; and Limerick Printmakers Studio and Gallery, which provides printmaking facilities, a venue for exhibitions and events and an education programme. The Limerick Youth Theatre provides young people with an opening into acting and production.The Irish Chamber Orchestra and the Irish World Music Centre are both based in the University of Limerick. The university has a thousand-seat state-of-the-art concert hall that hosts visiting performers. The city's music scene has produced bands such as The Cranberries, guitarist Noel Hogan's MonoBand, The Hitchers and others. Electronic musician Richard D. James, more commonly known as Aphex Twin, was born in Limerick in 1971. The Limerick Art Gallery and the Art College cater for painting, sculpture and performance art.\nLimerick is also home to comedians The Rubberbandits, D'Unbelievables (Pat Shortt and Jon Kenny) and Karl Spain. Dolan's Warehouse on the Dock Road is a venue specialising in live music, established in 1998. Baker Place was a nightclub that held mainly local underground nights until its closure in 2011. In 2020, it was announced that the Dromkeen-based Shiloh Trust was seeking planning permission to convert the former premises of Baker Place into a bible school. The Crush 87 nightclub (formerly known as Trinity Rooms until its closure in 2010), was relaunched in 2013.The city is the setting for Frank McCourt's memoir Angela's Ashes and the film adaptation. The Frank McCourt Museum situated in Frank's former school on Hartsonge Street opened in 2011 and contains artefacts from the book. Limerick has also been the setting or location for a number of other films, including the dramas The Real Thing (2002), Cowboys & Angels (2003) and Lost & Found (2015).Riverfest is a summer festival held annually in Limerick since 2004. The 2014 festival was held in May and had a record 80,000 visitors.\n\n\n== Humorous verse ==\nA limerick is a type of humorous verse of five lines with an AABBA rhyme scheme: the poem's connection with the city is obscure, but the name is generally taken to be a reference to Limerick city or County Limerick, sometimes particularly to the Maigue Poets, and may derive from an earlier form of nonsense verse parlour game that traditionally included a refrain that included \"Will [or won't] you come (up) to Limerick?\" The earliest known use of the name \"Limerick\" for this type poem is an 1880 reference, in a Saint John, New Brunswick newspaper, to an apparently well-known tune.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Broadcasting ===\nRT\u00c9 lyric fm, a state-run classical music radio station and part of RT\u00c9, broadcasts nationally from studios in the city centre on Cornmarket Square which opened in 1994. Limerick's local radio station is Live 95FM, broadcasting from 'Radio House', near the waterfront at Steamboat Quay. Spin South West, owned by Communicorp, broadcasts to Counties Kerry, Clare, Limerick, Tipperary and southwest Laois from its studios at Landmark Buildings in the Raheen Industrial Estate. Student radio station, Wired FM, broadcasts on 99.9FM from Mary Immaculate College. Wired FM also has studios in Limerick Institute of Technology. University Hospital Limerick has a radio station on 94.2FM, but this can be heard only in the hospital and surrounding area. West Limerick 102 is broadcast from Newcastle West. The national broadcaster, RT\u00c9, has radio and television studios in the city, which are periodically used to broadcast programming from Limerick.\n\n\n=== Print ===\nSeveral local newspapers are published in the city, including The Limerick Post and The Limerick Leader and magazines include the Limerick Event Guide, Business Limerick and Limerick Now.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\nLimerick city is approximately 25 km from Shannon Airport. Tourist attractions in the city centre include Limerick City Museum, King John's Castle (1210), St Mary's Cathedral (1168), the Hunt Museum, the University of Limerick, Georgian houses and gardens and the Treaty Stone.  There are several seasonal tours, including Angela's Ashes walking tour of Limerick City, historical walking tour, and boat tours along the River Shannon.\nThe city centre is divided between the traditional areas of \"English Town\" on the southern end of King's Island, which includes the King John's Castle; \"Irish Town\", which includes the older streets on the south bank; and the current economic centre further south, called \"Newtown Pery\". Newtown Pery was built in the late 18th century before the Act of Union and, unusually for an Irish city and unique in Limerick, is laid out on a grid plan. The Limerick City Museum (formerly aka the Jim Kemmy Municipal Museum), is located in Istabraq Hall, City Hall, Merchant's Quay. It contains displays on Limerick's history and manufactures.\n\nThe Georgian core of the city, with its Georgian architecture in the Newtown Pery, was developed from the mid 18th century. This core includes O'Connell Street (George Street before independence) from the Cecil Street intersection running to the south west end of the Crescent, and south-east to Pery Street including Glentworth Street and Barrington Street. Other buildings of architectural note in the city are St John's Cathedral, designed by the notable Victorian architect, Philip Charles Hardwick. St Mary's Cathedral, at over 800 years old, is one of the oldest in Ireland. St John's Cathedral, whilst more modern, has Ireland's tallest spire at 94 m (308 ft).\nThe Hunt Museum is based in the historic 18th-century former Custom House. The museum was established to house a collection of approximately 2000 works of art and antiquities formed by John and Gertrude Hunt during their lifetimes.\nThe main park in Limerick is the People's Park which was opened in 1877 in memory of Richard Russell, a prominent local business man. The park is dominated by the Thomas Spring Rice memorial (MP for the city 1820\u20131832) and has a large collection of mature deciduous and evergreen trees.\nLimerick city centre changed significantly with the construction of several modern high-rise buildings in the early 2000s, in particular as part of the regeneration of the former docks area along the Dock Road. The suburban areas, where the majority of the population now live, have grown out from the centre along the main roads to Ennis (North Circular and Ennis Road areas/Caherdavin), Dublin (Castletroy and the University) and Cork (Ballinacurra/Dooradoyle/Raheen). Suburban houses are generally two-floor semi-detached homes for single families. These were built from the 1950s onwards in large estates by government projects and commercial developments, although there are many examples of Edwardian and older 1930s suburban homes on the main suburban thoroughfares leading towards the city (North & South Circular, Ballinacurra Road, O'Connell Avenue).\n\nLimerick city's nightlife is supported by a number of nightclubs and pubs which offer music. For example, Dolan's Warehouse is a small music venue which hosts local, national and international folk, indie, jazz, rock and traditional Irish music acts.In County Limerick, Adare village and the Foynes Flying Boat Museum, approximately 35 km (22 miles/30 minutes) from Limerick City along the scenic coastal N69 route from Limerick to Tralee, are also attractions. Bunratty Castle in County Clare is another local attraction, and is situated 15.4 km north of the city. Limerick is known to be the antipodes to the Campbell Islands of New Zealand.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nLimerick is the third largest city in Ireland (after Dublin and Cork) with a population of 94,192 in the urban area and 104,952 in the metropolitan district, according to the 2016 CSO census. The past census reported a large population decline in central city areas due in part to the Limerick regeneration process where in these areas the largest reduction was reported nationally and also to outward migration following the collapse of the local and national economy from 2008 onwards. The population of the Limerick Larger Urban Zone as defined by the EU is 162,413. The ethnic diversity in Limerick's population, which includes a large immigrant community, saw rapid growth during the Celtic Tiger and the following decade. The Polish community is one of the largest demographic groups in the Municipal District, with approximately 4,000 living and working in the area. Ireland's first Polish bank opened in 2007. The African community has set up a number of churches, which are now part of the cultural makeup of the city.Limerick has a large stock of local authority housing. Prior to the merger of Limerick City and County Council 41% of all housing within the old Limerick City Council boundary was local authority, which was the highest in Ireland. This figure is however no longer accurate given the larger metropolitan district of the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nLimerick is in the region dubbed \"the Midwest\". Also known as the \"Shannon Region\", this is primarily an economic and social concept. The region encompasses County Limerick, County Clare, North County Tipperary, Northwest County Kerry and south County Offaly, with its focal point centred on Limerick and its environs within an 8-kilometre (5 mi) radius.\nThe area is the main economic region in Ireland outside Dublin and Cork. Its economic development has been driven in part by the University of Limerick, Limerick Institute of Technology, Shannon Airport in County Clare and Shannon Development (an economic development agency), whose precursor was SFADCO (Shannon Free Airport Development Company), an economic agency that provided tax incentives to companies locating in the area surrounding Shannon Airport. As of 2006 Shannon Development was mostly concerned with disposing of valuable industrial park properties. Limerick Chamber of Commerce, a representative body for businesses in the region, celebrated its bicentennial/bicentenary in 2015.\nHistorically Limerick was an agricultural commodity-driven economy, due to its position as the first major port along the River Shannon. By the middle of the 18th century, Limerick Port grew to become one of Ireland's principal commercial ports, exporting agricultural produce from the most fertile tracts in Ireland known as the Golden Vale as well as produce from the surrounding counties. The city was one of the main meat processing areas in Ireland, and industry included confectionery and flour production. The city was known for its bacon industry \u2013 however this went into decline in the mid-20th century. The fishing industry in Limerick, based on Clancy's Strand opposite King John's Castle and at Coonagh nearby, once employed hundreds of men. The boat most commonly used was the Gandelow which was also used as a small Lighter (barge) to ferry goods to and from larger ships in the port. In the 1920s the construction of a dam at Ardnacrusha severely impacted salmon breeding and that, and the introduction of quotas, had by the 1950s caused salmon fishing to diminish. By 2006, most fishermen had relinquished their drift net licences and the industry can now be said to be dormant.As with other cities in Ireland, a number of multinational companies are based in Limerick, and the city is a growing recipient of foreign direct investment. Dell had its main European Manufacturing Facility at the Raheen Business Park however in January 2009 Dell announced that it would close its Limerick computer manufacturing plant and move the production lines to Poland. The facility was the largest Dell manufacturing plant outside the United States and produced 30,000\u201360,000 units per day for export to the EMEA. Dell remains one of the largest employers in the mid-west with over 1,000 people employed in service and support. Analog Devices has its European manufacturing base in Raheen, 3 km south-west of the city centre. The site employs more than 1,000 people. Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Vistakon (the world's largest manufacturer of contact lenses) has a large facility in Castletroy in the National Technology Park and also employs close to 1,000 people. It is Vistakon's only production facility outside the United States and one of the largest contact-lens manufacturing plants in the world. Cook Medical, the world's largest privately owned Medical Devices company, employs over 800 people in Limerick at the National Technology Park.\nThe Post-2008 Irish economic downturn had a profound effect on Limerick. The announcement in 2009 that Dell was to move its manufacturing facility from Limerick to Poland devastated the local economy. 1,900 jobs were lost at Dell and it is believed that for every job that was lost at Dell at least another 4 to 5 were at risk. The closure of the Dell manufacturing facility amounted to 2% of Ireland's national GDP. The downturn in the construction industry also cost many jobs as did the stalled Limerick regeneration programme which promised investment in Limerick's deprived city areas. As of 2012 unemployment had become a major problem across the city with the unemployment rate in the city at 28.6% which was almost twice the national average.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nThe Crescent Shopping Centre is the largest shopping centre in Ireland, outside of Dublin, and the largest in the province of Munster. It is located in Dooradoyle about 3 km south of the city centre, and has over 90 shopping outlets along with restaurants and a 12-screen Omniplex Cinema. The city centre also has a large retail district which includes a mix of more traditional type of shops as well as some modern high street stores. Cruises Street is one of the main shopping streets. O'Connell Street, William Street, Bedford Row and Thomas Street) are also retail streets within the city. The city centre saw some works on remodelling in the early 21st century, with pedestrianisation works on Bedford Row, Thomas Street and parts of Catherine Street, as well as widening footpaths on William Street. These works have sought to address a reduction of footfall in the city centre (in turn influencing the closure of many city centre retail businesses) which occurred from the recession of 2008 onwards.\n\n\n==== Retail parks and shopping centres ====\n\nDuring the Celtic Tiger years a number of shopping centres and retail parks opened in suburban areas of Limerick. In addition to the Crescent Shopping Centre, which expanded in the early 2000s, the Jetland Shopping Centre opened in Caherdavin in 2005. The Childers Road Retail Park and the Parkway Shopping Centre in the east of the city also have a number of high street stores. Unfinished retail centres include the Coonagh Cross retail development and the Parkway Valley Shopping Centre on the Dublin Road. A proposed but unapproved retail development project, the Opera Centre, makes up part of the \"Limerick 2030\" scheme.\n\n\n==== The Milk Market ====\nThe Milk Market located at Cornmarket Row in the city centre sells locally produced foods and products and is governed by Limerick Market Trustees. In 2010 work was undertaken to redevelop the existing premises to an all-weather, all year round facility as it operated in an outdoor environment. The work involved constructing a large canopy over the existing market premises and was officially re-opened in June 2010. The Milk Market Project won the 2011 Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI) 'Peoples Choice Award'.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nIn 2013, a renewable energy strategy was launched for the region, and proposed a 20% reduction in CO2-emissions, while ensuring that short-term actions were beneficial to the long-term goal of 100% renewable energy. The strategy was completed by the Danish Aalborg University.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\nShannon Airport is 20 km west of the city in County Clare. It is one of Ireland's main airports and is easily accessible from Limerick via the N18 dual carriageway and from other regions via the Limerick Tunnel. It has scheduled flights to European and North American destinations. Airlines using the airport include Ryanair, Aer Lingus, United Airlines, American Airlines, Aer Lingus Regional and Delta Air Lines. There is no rail link to the airport. Coonagh airfield, a few kilometres west of Caherdavin, serves small private aircraft. Kerry and Cork Airports are around 1 hour 30 minutes and 2 hours drive away, respectively. Kerry Airport is connected to Farranfore railway station, from Limerick railway station travel via Limerick Junction and Mallow.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nLocal public transport is provided by several companies. Bus \u00c9ireann, Ireland's state-owned bus company, operates a number of services subsidised by the National Transport Authority, while a number of provide operators also run commercial bus services in and around Limerick. An updated city bus network was introduced in Limerick City in December 2016, which introduced new routes. In May 2019, Bus \u00c9ireann further changed and improved the Limerick City timetable, including increased frequency and later operating times.\nOther rural buses run to towns and villages in the county and to Shannon Airport. There are also a number of Intercity and international buses from Bus \u00c9ireann's bus terminal adjoining Limerick Colbert railway station. These include hourly services to Dublin, Cork, Ennis and Galway. Bus \u00c9ireann have also commenced a Limerick to Galway Express service travelling on the M18 in addition to the regular service. Buses run every 2 hours to Tralee and Killarney. There are also regular daily services to Waterford and Athlone, and a daily service to London via the ferry from Rosslare Europort.\nThere are a number of private bus companies in operation providing city and intercity services. Dublin Coach provide the M7 express service which operates every hour from Arthur's Quay which goes to Dublin or Ennis. JJ Kavanagh also provide Dublin to Limerick services from Arthur's Quay. Citylink run a number of services from Limerick to Galway and Cork and operate from Henry Street.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nIarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann's Limerick Colbert station is the railway hub for the city and the Mid West Region with a number of intercity and commuter rail services. Limerick railway station opened on 28 August 1858, replacing an earlier, temporary station 500 m east, which had operated from 9 May 1848.The following inter city routes are available from Limerick Colbert station :\n\nLimerick to Dublin Heuston: 16 services daily including 4 direct services. All remaining Dublin \u2013 Limerick services require passengers to change to the Dublin to Cork train at either Limerick Junction or at Ballybrophy railway station.\nLimerick to Waterford: 2 services daily (but none on Sundays).

Due to speed restrictions this alternative Dublin \u2013 Limerick route can take 60 minutes longer (with a change at Ballybrophy) than by Limerick Junction albeit a more direct service.\nLimerick \u2013 Limerick Junction and ThurlesThere are also a number of disused railway lines including the Limerick to Foynes line which closed to freight in the early 2000s, having lost passenger services in the early 1960s, although the track is still in situ.  This is the last remaining part of the North Kerry Line which closed to passenger traffic in the early 1960s and to freight traffic (other than Limerick \u2013 Foynes) in the mid-1970s, and has been lifted between Ballingrane (near Rathkeale) and Tralee.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nLimerick's central location in the mid\u2013west of Ireland means many national primary routes converge on the city. The M7 (Dublin), N/M18 (Galway, Ennis, Shannon), N/M20 (Cork), N21 (Tralee) and N24 (Waterford) routes all start/terminate in or near the city. Road infrastructure is further supplemented by the southern ring road and Limerick Tunnel bypass of the city and the M20 bypass of Dooradoyle and Raheen to the south of the city. Connections to the other cities were improved with the completion of the M7 motorway in December 2010, and continuing upgrades ongoing to the N/M18 to Shannon, Ennis, Galway and Tuam \u2013 the final section opened in September 2017. A motorway is also planned between Cork and Limerick, with a proposed completion date in the mid 2020s.\n\n\n=== Waterway transport ===\nHistorically, waterway transport has been key to Limerick's development. Vikings established the city as a maritime trading port. The city's position on a major Irish river system, the Shannon, enabled transport to the midlands of Ireland and further north and west. By the 18th century with the opening of canal systems throughout Ireland, Limerick Port established itself as Ireland's premier commercial port on the western side of the country. This was enabled by ease of access from the facilitated by the opening of canals but most importantly to the River Shannon. The opening of the Grand Canal in the 18th century provided further access to Dublin and the east of the country. There are also a number of disused canals in the vicinity of the city including the Park Canal & the Passey \u2013 Errina Canal on the old Limerick navigation. Waterway transport on the Shannon was regularly used to transport goods from Limerick to Dublin and vice versa however this mode of transport fell into decline in the 20th century. Originally Limerick port was located near the confluence of the Abbey and Shannon rivers at King's Island. Today the Shannon Foynes Port is located further downstream on the Shannon alongside the Dock Road. This general purpose facility port is operated by the Shannon Foynes Port Company who operate all marine activities in the Shannon estuary.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nLimerick is a centre of higher education in the region, and technical and continuation education within the city traces its beginning back to the formation of the Limerick Athenaeum Society in 1852, marking the foundation of the Limerick Institute of Technology.

        "wiki": "Richard John Harris (1 October 1930 \u2013 25 October 2002) was an Irish actor and singer. He appeared on stage and in many films, notably as Frank Machin in This Sporting Life, for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, and as King Arthur in the 1967 film Camelot, as well as the 1981 revival of the stage musical.\nHe played an aristocrat captured by American Indians in A Man Called Horse (1970), a gunfighter in Clint Eastwood's Western film Unforgiven (1992), Emperor Marcus Aurelius in Gladiator (2000), and Albus Dumbledore in the first two Harry Potter films: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001) and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002), the latter of which was his final film role. He was replaced by Michael Gambon for the remainder of the series. Harris had a number-one singing hit in Australia and Canada, and a top-ten hit in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and United States with his 1968 recording of Jimmy Webb's song \"MacArthur Park.\" In 2020, he was listed at number 3 on The Irish Times list of Ireland's greatest film actors.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHarris was born on 1 October 1930, in Limerick.He was schooled by the Jesuits at Crescent College. A talented rugby player, he appeared on several Munster Junior and Senior Cup teams for Crescent, and played for Garryowen. Harris's athletic career was cut short when he caught tuberculosis in his teens. He remained an ardent fan of the Munster Rugby and Young Munster teams until his death, attending many of their matches, and there are numerous stories of japes at rugby matches with actors and fellow rugby fans Peter O'Toole and Richard Burton.\nAfter recovering from tuberculosis, Harris moved to Great Britain, wanting to become a director. He could not find any suitable training courses, and enrolled in the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA) to learn acting. He had failed an audition at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) and had been rejected by the Central School of Speech and Drama, because they felt he was too old at 24. While still a student, he rented the tiny \"off-West End\" Irving Theatre, and there directed his own production of Clifford Odets' play Winter Journey (The Country Girl).\nAfter completing his studies at the Academy, he joined Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop. He began getting roles in West End theatre productions, starting with The Quare Fellow in 1956, a transfer from the Theatre Workshop. He spent nearly a decade in obscurity, learning his profession on stages throughout the UK.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early supporting roles ===\nHarris made his film debut in 1959 in the film Alive and Kicking, and played the lead role in The Ginger Man in the West End in 1959. In his second film he had a small role as an IRA Volunteer in Shake Hands with the Devil (1959), supporting James Cagney. The film was shot in Ireland and directed by Michael Anderson who offered Harris a role in his next movie, The Wreck of the Mary Deare (1959), shot in Hollywood.\nHarris played another IRA Volunteer in A Terrible Beauty (1960), alongside Robert Mitchum. He had a memorable bit part in the film The Guns of Navarone (1961) as a Royal Australian Air Force pilot who reports that blowing up the \"bloody guns\" of the island of Navarone is impossible by an air raid. He had a larger part in The Long and the Short and the Tall (1961), playing a British soldier; Harris clashed with Laurence Harvey during filming.\nFor his role in the film Mutiny on the Bounty (1962), despite being virtually unknown to film audiences, Harris reportedly insisted on third billing, behind Trevor Howard and Marlon Brando, an actor he greatly admired, but Harris fell out with Brando over the latter's behaviour during the film's production.\n\n\n=== This Sporting Life ===\nHarris's first starring role was in the film This Sporting Life (1963), as a bitter young coal miner, Frank Machin, who becomes an acclaimed rugby league football player. It was based on the novel by David Storey and directed by Lindsay Anderson. For his role, Harris won Best Actor in 1963 at the Cannes Film Festival and an Academy Award nomination.\nHarris followed this with a leading role in the Italian film, Michelangelo Antonioni's Il Deserto Rosso (Red Desert, 1964). This won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival.\nHarris received an offer to support Kirk Douglas in a British war film, The Heroes of Telemark (1965), directed by Anthony Mann, playing a Norwegian resistance leader. He then went to Hollywood to support Charlton Heston in Sam Peckinpah's Major Dundee (1965), as an Irish immigrant who became a Confederate cavalryman during the American Civil War.\nHe played Cain in John Huston's film The Bible: In the Beginning... (1966). More successful at the box office was Hawaii (1966), in which Harris starred alongside Julie Andrews and Max von Sydow. As a change of pace, he was the romantic lead in a Doris Day spy spoof comedy, Caprice (1967), directed by Frank Tashlin.\n\n\n=== Camelot, A Man Called Horse ===\nHarris next performed the role of King Arthur in the film adaptation of the musical play Camelot (1967). Critic Roger Ebert described the casting of Harris and Vanessa Redgrave as \"about the best King Arthur and Queen Guenevere I can imagine\". Harris revived the role in a Broadway revival at the Winter Garden Theatre from 15 November 1981, to 2 January 1982, and broadcast on HBO a year later. Starring Meg Bussert as Guenevere, Richard Muenz as Lancelot and Thor Fields as Tom of Warwick. Harris, who had starred in the film, and Muenz also took the show on tour nationwide.In The Molly Maguires (1970), he played James McParland, the detective who infiltrates the title organisation, headed by Sean Connery. It was a box office flop. However A Man Called Horse (1970), with Harris in the title role, an 1825 English aristocrat who is captured by Indians, was a major success.\nHe played the title role in the film Cromwell in 1970 opposite Alec Guinness as King Charles I of England. That year British exhibitors voted him the 9th-most popular star at the UK box office.\n\n\n=== Singing career ===\nHarris recorded several albums of music, one of which, A Tramp Shining, included the seven-minute hit song \"MacArthur Park\" (Harris insisted on singing the lyric as \"MacArthur's Park\"). This song was written by Jimmy Webb, and it reached number 2 on the American Billboard Hot 100 chart. It also topped several music sales charts in Europe during the summer of 1968. \"MacArthur Park\" sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. A second album, also consisting entirely of music composed by Webb, The Yard Went on Forever, was released in 1969. In the 1973 TV special \"Burt Bacharach in Shangri-La\", after singing Webb's \"Didn't We\", Harris tells Bacharach that since he was not a trained singer he approached songs as an actor concerned with words and emotions, acting the song with the sort of honesty the song is trying to convey. Then he proceeds to sing \"If I Could Go Back\", from the Lost Horizon soundtrack.\n\n\n=== 1970s ===\nIn 1971 Harris starred in a BBC TV film adaptation The Snow Goose, from a screenplay by Paul Gallico. It won a Golden Globe for Best Movie made for TV and was nominated for both a BAFTA and an Emmy. and was shown in the U.S. as part of the Hallmark Hall of Fame.\nHe made his directorial debut with Bloomfield (1971) and starred in Man in the Wilderness (1971) a revisionist Western based on the Hugh Glass story.\n\n\n=== Action star ===\nHarris starred in a Western for Samuel Fuller, Riata, which stopped production several weeks into filming. The project was re-assembled with a new director and cast, except for Harris, who returned: The Deadly Trackers (1973).\nIn 1973, Harris published a book of poetry, I, In the Membership of My Days, which was later reissued in part in an audio LP format, augmented by self-penned songs such as \"I Don't Know.\"\nHarris starred in two thrillers: 99 and 44/100% Dead (1974), for John Frankenheimer, and Juggernaut (1974), for Richard Lester. In Echoes of a Summer (1976) he played the father of a young girl with a terminal illness. He had a cameo as Richard the Lionheart in Robin and Marian (1976), for Lester, then was in The Return of a Man Called Horse (1976).\nHarris led the all-star cast in the train disaster film The Cassandra Crossing (1976). He played Gulliver in the part-animated Gulliver's Travels (1977) and was reunited with Michael Anderson in Orca (1977), battling a killer whale.\nHe appeared in another action film, Golden Rendezvous (1977), based on a novel by Alistair Maclean, shot in South Africa. Harris was sued by the film's producer for his drinking; Harris counter-sued for defamation and the matter was settled out of court.Golden Rendezvous was a flop but The Wild Geese (1978), where Harris played one of several mercenaries, was a big success outside America. Ravagers (1979) was more action, set in a post-apocalyptic world. Game for Vultures (1979) was set in Rhodesia and shot in South Africa.\nIn Hollywood he appeared in a comedy, The Last Word (1979), then supported Bo Derek in Tarzan, the Ape Man (1981).\nHe made a film in Canada, Your Ticket Is No Longer Valid (1981), a drama about impotence. He followed it with another Canadian film, Highpoint, a movie so bad it was not released for several years.\n\n\n=== Camelot again ===\nHarris's career was revived by his success on stage in Camelot.\nHis film work during this period included: Triumphs of a Man Called Horse (1983), Martin's Day (1985), Strike Commando 2 (1988), King of the Wind (1990) and Mack the Knife (1990) (a film version of The Threepenny Opera in which he played J.J. Peachum ) plus the TV film version of Maigret, opposite Barbara Shelley. This indicated declining popularity which Harris told his biographer, Michael Feeney Callan, he was \"utterly reconciled to\".\n\n\n=== The Field and Harry Potter ===\nIn June 1989, director Jim Sheridan cast Harris in the lead role in The Field, written by the esteemed Irish playwright John B. Keane. The lead role of \"Bull\" McCabe was to be played by former Abbey Theatre actor Ray McAnally. When McAnally died suddenly on 15 June 1989, Harris was offered the McCabe role. The Field was released in 1990 and earned Harris his second Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. He lost to Jeremy Irons for Reversal of Fortune.\nIn 1992, Harris had a supporting role in the film Patriot Games. He had good roles in Unforgiven (1992), Wrestling Ernest Hemingway (1993) and Silent Tongue (1994). He played the title role in Abraham (1994) and had the lead in Cry, the Beloved Country (1995).\nA lifelong supporter of Jesuit education principles, Harris established a friendship with University of Scranton President Rev. J. A. Panuska and raised funds for a scholarship for Irish students established in honour of his brother and manager, Dermot, who had died the previous year of a heart attack. He chaired acting workshops and cast the university's production of Julius Caesar in November 1987.\nOver several years in the late 1980s, Harris worked with Irish author Michael Feeney Callan on his biography, which was published by Sidgwick & Jackson in 1990.\nHarris appeared in two films which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. First, as the gunfighter \"English Bob\" in the Western Unforgiven (1992); second, as the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius in Ridley Scott's Gladiator (2000). He also played a lead role alongside James Earl Jones in the Darrell Roodt film adaptation of Cry, the Beloved Country (1995). In 1999, Harris starred in the film To Walk with Lions. After Gladiator, Harris played the supporting role of Albus Dumbledore in the first two of the Harry Potter films, and as Abb\u00e9 Faria in Kevin Reynolds' film adaptation of The Count of Monte Cristo (2002). The film Kaena: The Prophecy (2003) was dedicated to him posthumously as he had voiced the character Opaz before his death.\nConcerning his role as Dumbledore, Harris had stated that he did not intend to take the part at first, since he knew that his health was in decline, but he relented and accepted it because his 11-year-old granddaughter threatened to never speak to him again if he did not take it. In an interview with the Toronto Star in 2001, Harris expressed his concern that his association with the Harry Potter films would outshine the rest of his career. He explained, \"Because, you see, I don't just want to be remembered for being in those bloody films, and I'm afraid that's what's going to happen to me.\"Harris also made part of the Bible TV movie project filmed as a cinema production for the TV, a project produced by Lux Vide Italy with the collaboration of Radio Televisione Italiana RAI and Channel 5 of France, and premiered in the United States in the channel TNT in the 1990s. He portrayed the main and title character in the production Abraham (1993) as well as Saint John of Patmos in the 2000 TV film production Apocalypse.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1957, Harris married Elizabeth Rees-Williams, daughter of David Rees-Williams, 1st Baron Ogmore. They had three children: actor Jared Harris, actor Jamie Harris, and director Damian Harris. Harris and Rees-Williams divorced in 1969, after which Elizabeth married Rex Harrison. Harris's second marriage was to the American actor Ann Turkel. In 1982, they divorced.Harris was a member of the Roman Catholic Knights of Malta, and was also dubbed a knight by the Queen of Denmark in 1985.Harris paid \u00a375,000 for William Burges' Tower House in Holland Park in 1968, after discovering that the American entertainer Liberace had arranged to buy the house but had not yet put down a deposit. Harris employed the original decorators, Campbell Smith & Company Ltd., to carry out extensive restoration work on the interior.Harris was a vocal supporter of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) from 1973 until 1984. In January 1984 remarks he made on the previous month's Harrods bombing caused great controversy, after which he discontinued his support for the PIRA.At the height of his stardom in the 1960s and early 1970s Harris was almost as well known for his hellraiser lifestyle and heavy drinking as he was for his acting career. He was a longtime alcoholic until he became a teetotaler in 1981. Nevertheless, he did resume drinking Guinness a decade later. He gave up drugs after almost dying from a cocaine overdose in 1978.\nOn 25 June 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Richard Harris among hundreds of artists whose master tapes were destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.\n\n\n== Illness and death ==\nHarris was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease in August 2002, reportedly after being hospitalised with pneumonia. He died at University College Hospital in Bloomsbury, London, on 25 October 2002, aged 72. He is survived by his three sons, Damian, Jared and Jamie. He spent his final three days in a coma. Harris's body was cremated, and his ashes were scattered in the Bahamas, where he owned a home. His last words were \"It was the food!\"Harris was a lifelong friend of actor Peter O'Toole, and his family reportedly hoped that O'Toole would replace Harris as Dumbledore in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. There were, however, concerns about insuring O'Toole for the six remaining films in the series. Harris was ultimately succeeded as Dumbledore by Irish-born actor Michael Gambon.\n\n\n== Memorials ==\n\nOn 30 September 2006, Manuel Di Lucia, of Kilkee, County Clare, a longtime friend, organised the placement in Kilkee of a bronze life-size statue of Richard Harris. It shows Harris at the age of eighteen playing the sport of squash. The sculptor was Seamus Connolly and the work was unveiled by Russell Crowe. Harris was an accomplished squash racquets player, winning the Tivoli Cup in Kilkee four years in a row from 1948 to 1951, a record unsurpassed to this day.Another life-size statue of Richard Harris, as King Arthur from his film, Camelot, has been erected in Bedford Row, in the centre of his home town of Limerick. The sculptor of this statue was the Irish sculptor Jim Connolly, a graduate of the Limerick School of Art and Design.\nAt the 2009 BAFTAs, Mickey Rourke dedicated his Best Actor award to Harris, calling him a \"good friend and great actor\".\nIn 2013, Rob Gill and Zeb Moore founded the annual Richard Harris International Film Festival.\nThe Richard Harris Film Festival is one of Ireland's fastest-growing film festivals. Growing from just ten films in 2013 to screening over 115 films in 2017. Each year one of Harris's sons attends the annual festival (October Bank Holiday Weekend) in Limerick.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Soundtracks and compilations ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of people on the postage stamps of Ireland\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMichael Feeney Callan (1 December 2004).

        "wiki": "The Boeing 314 Clipper was an American long-range flying boat produced by Boeing from 1938 to 1941. One of the largest aircraft of its time, it had the range to cross the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. For its wing, Boeing re-used the design from their earlier XB-15 bomber prototype. Twelve Clippers were built, nine of which served with Pan Am.\n\n\n== Design and development ==\n\nPan American had requested a flying boat with unprecedented range that could augment the airline's trans-Pacific Martin M-130. Boeing's bid was successful and on July 21, 1936, Pan American signed a contract for six. Boeing engineers adapted the cancelled XB-15's 149 ft (45 m) wing, and replaced the 850 hp (630 kW) Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasp radial engines with the 1,600 hp (1,200 kW) Wright Twin Cyclone. Pan Am ordered six more aircraft with increased engine power and capacity for 77 daytime passengers as the Boeing 314A.\nThe huge flying boat was assembled at Boeing's Plant 1 on the Duwamish River in Seattle, and towed to Elliott Bay for taxi and flight tests. The first flight was on June 7, 1938, piloted by Edmund T. \"Eddie\" Allen. At first the aircraft had a single vertical tail, and Allen found he had inadequate directional control. The aircraft returned to the factory and was fitted with the endplates on the ends of the horizontal tail in place of the single vertical fin. This too was found to be insufficient and finally the centerline vertical fin was restored, after which the aircraft flew satisfactorily.The 314 used a series of heavy ribs and spars to create a robust fuselage and cantilevered wing, eliminating the need for external drag-inducing struts to brace the wings. Boeing also incorporated Dornier-style sponsons into the hull structure. The sponsons, broad lateral extensions at the waterline on both sides of the hull, served several purposes: they provided a wide platform to stabilize the craft while floating, they acted as a gangway for boarding and exiting, and they possessed intentional shaping to contribute additional aerodynamic lift in flight. Passengers and their baggage were weighed, with each passenger allowed up to 77 pounds (35 kg) free baggage allowance (in the later 314 series) but then charged $3.25 per pound ($7.2/kg) (equivalent to $59 in 2019) for exceeding the limit. To fly the long ranges needed for trans-Pacific service, the 314 carried 4,246 US gallons (16,070 l; 3,536 imp gal) of gasoline. The later 314A model carried a further 1,200 US gallons (4,500 l; 1,000 imp gal). A capacity of 300 US gallons (1,100 l; 250 imp gal) of oil was required for operation of the radial engines.\n\nPan Am's \"Clippers\" were built for \"one-class\" luxury air travel, a necessity given the long duration of transoceanic flights. The seats could be converted into 36 bunks for overnight accommodation; with a cruising speed of 188 miles per hour (303 km/h) (typically flights at maximum gross weight were flown at 155 miles per hour (249 km/h)) in 1940, Pan Am's schedule San Francisco to Honolulu was 19 hours. The 314s had a lounge and dining area, and the galleys were crewed by chefs from four-star hotels. Men and women were provided with separate dressing rooms, and white-coated stewards served five and six-course meals with gleaming silver service. The standard of luxury on Pan American's Boeing 314s has rarely been matched on  heavier-than-air transport since then; they were a form of travel for the super-rich, priced at $675 (equivalent to $12,000 in 2019) round trip from New York to Southampton. Most of the flights were transpacific, with a one-way ticket from San Francisco to Hong Kong via the \"stepping-stone\" islands posted at $760 (equivalent to $14,000 in 2019). The Pan Am Boeing 314 Clippers brought exotic destinations like the Far East within reach of air travelers and came to represent the romance of flight. Transatlantic flights to neutral Lisbon and Ireland continued after war broke out in Europe in September 1939 (and until 1945), but military passengers and cargoes necessarily got priority, and the service was more spartan.\nEqually critical to the 314's success was the proficiency of its Pan Am flight crews, who were extremely skilled at long-distance, over-water flight operations and navigation. For training, many of the transpacific flights carried a second crew. Only the very best and most experienced flight crews were assigned Boeing 314 flying boat duty. Before coming aboard, all Pan Am captains as well as first and second officers had thousands of hours of flight time in other seaplanes and flying boats. Rigorous training in dead reckoning, timed turns, judging drift from sea current, astral navigation, and radio navigation were conducted. In conditions of poor or no visibility, pilots sometimes made successful landings at fogged-in harbors by landing out to sea, then taxiing the 314 into port.\n\n\n== Operational history ==\n\nThe first 314 flight on the San Francisco-Hong Kong route left Alameda on February 23, 1939 with regular passenger and Foreign Air Mail Route #14 service beginning on March 29. A one-way trip on this route took over six days to complete. Commercial passenger service lasted less than three years, ending when the United States entered World War II in December 1941.\nThe Yankee Clipper flew across the Atlantic on a route from Southampton to Port Washington, New York with intermediate stops at Foynes in Ireland, Botwood in Newfoundland, and Shediac, New Brunswick. The inaugural trip occurred on June 24, 1939.\nThe success of the six initial Clippers had led Pan Am to place an order for six improved 314A models to be delivered in 1941, with the goal of doubling the service on both Atlantic and Pacific routes. However, the fall of France in 1940 caused some doubt about whether the Atlantic service could continue; passenger numbers were already reduced due to the war, and if Spain or Portugal were to join the Axis, then the flights to Lisbon would be forced to stop. Pan Am began to consider reducing their order and, in August 1940, reached an agreement to sell three of the six under construction to the United Kingdom. The aircraft were to be operated by the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and were primarily intended for the UK \u2013 West Africa route, as existing flying boats could not travel this route without stopping in Lisbon. The sale made a small net profit for Pan Am \u2013 priced at cost plus 5% \u2013 and provided a vital communications link for Britain, but was politically controversial. In order to arrange the sale, the junior minister Harold Balfour had to agree to the contract with no government approval, leading to stern disapproval from Winston Churchill and lengthy debate by the Cabinet over the propriety of the purchase. Churchill later flew on the Bristol and Berwick, which he praised intensely, adding to the Clippers\u2019 fame during the war.At the outbreak of the war in the Pacific in December 1941, the Pacific Clipper was en route to New Zealand from San Francisco. Rather than risk flying back to Honolulu and being shot down by Japanese fighters, it was directed to fly west to New York. Starting on December 8, 1941 at Auckland, New Zealand, the Pacific Clipper covered over 31,500 mi (50,700 km) via locations including Surabaya, Karachi, Bahrain, Khartoum and Leopoldville. The Pacific Clipper landed at Pan American's LaGuardia Field seaplane base at 7:12 on the morning of January 6, 1942, completing the first commercial plane flight to circumnavigate the world.Pan Am's Clipper fleet was pressed into US military service during World War II, and the flying boats were used for ferrying personnel and equipment to the European and Pacific fronts. The aircraft were purchased by the War and Navy Departments and leased back to Pan Am for a dollar, with the understanding that all would be operated by the Navy once four-engined replacements for the Army's four Clippers were in service. Only the markings on the aircraft changed: the Clippers continued to be flown by their experienced Pan Am civilian crews.  American military cargo was carried via Natal, Brazil to Liberia, to supply the British forces at Cairo and even the Russians, via the Persian Corridor. The Model 314 was then the only aircraft in the world that could make the 2,150-statute-mile (3,460 km) crossing over water,  and was given the military designation C-98. Since the Pan Am pilots and crews had extensive expertise in using flying boats for extreme long-distance over-water flights, the company's pilots and navigators continued to serve as flight crew. In 1943, President Franklin D. Roosevelt traveled to the Casablanca Conference in a Pan-Am crewed Boeing 314 Dixie Clipper.After the war, several Clippers were returned to Pan American hands. However, even before hostilities had ended, the Clipper had become obsolete. The flying boat's advantage had been that it didn't require long concrete runways, but during the war a great many such runways had been built for heavy bombers. New long-range airliners such as the Lockheed Constellation and Douglas DC-4 were developed. The new landplanes were relatively easy to fly, and did not require the extensive pilot training programs mandated for seaplane operations. One of the 314's most experienced pilots said, \"We were indeed glad to change to DC-4s, and I argued daily for eliminating all flying boats. The landplanes were much safer. No one in the operations department... had any idea of the hazards of flying boat operations. The main problem now was lack of the very high level of experience and competence required of seaplane pilots\".\n\n\n=== Retirement ===\n\nThe last Pan Am 314 to be retired, the California Clipper NC18602, in 1946, had accumulated more than a million flight miles. Of the 12 Boeing 314 Clippers built, three were lost to accidents, although only one of those resulted in fatalities: 24 passengers and crew aboard the Yankee Clipper NC18603 lost their lives in a landing accident at Cabo Ruivo Seaplane Base, in Lisbon, Portugal on February 22, 1943. Among that flight's passengers were prominent American author and war correspondent Benjamin Robertson, who was killed, and the American singer and actress Jane Froman, who was seriously injured.Pan-Am's 314 was removed from scheduled service in 1946 and the seven serviceable B-314s were purchased by the start-up airline New World Airways. These sat at San Diego's Lindbergh Field for a long time before all were eventually sold for scrap in 1950. The last of the fleet, the Anzac Clipper NC18611(A), was resold and scrapped at Baltimore, Maryland in late 1951.\nBOAC's 314As were withdrawn from the Baltimore-to-Bermuda route in January 1948, replaced by Lockheed Constellations flying from New York and Baltimore to Bermuda.\n\n\n== Variants ==\nModel 314\nInitial production version with 1,500 horsepower (1,100 kW) Twin Cyclone engines, six built for Pan Am.\nModel 314A\nImproved version with 1,600 horsepower (1,200 kW) Twin Cyclones with larger-diameter propellers, additional 1,200 US gallons (4,500 l; 1,000 imp gal) fuel capacity, and revised interior. Still air range approx 4,700 miles. Six built, three for Pan Am and three sold to BOAC.\nB-314\nFive Model 314s pressed into military service with the U.S. Navy\nC-98\nFour Model 314s pressed into military service with the U.S. Army Air Forces\nModel 306\nA concept aircraft using a Model 314 fuselage with a tailless delta-wing planform. No examples built.\n\n\n== Operators ==\n United StatesPan American World Airways\nUnited States Army Air Forces\nUnited States Navy\nWorld Airways United KingdomBritish Overseas Airways Corporation\n\n\n== Surviving aircraft ==\n\nNone of the dozen 314s built between 1939 and 1941 survived beyond 1951, with all 12 being scrapped, scuttled, cannibalized for parts, or otherwise written off. Underwater Admiralty Sciences, a non-profit oceanographic exploration and science research organization based in Kirkland, Washington, announced in 2005, at the 70th Anniversary of the first China Clipper flight in San Francisco, its plans to survey, photograph, and possibly recover the remains of the hulls of two sunken 314s: NC18601 (Honolulu Clipper), scuttled in the Pacific Ocean in 1945; and NC18612 (Bermuda Sky Queen, formerly Cape Town Clipper), sunk in the Atlantic by the Coast Guard in 1947.  UAS has also spent significant time at Pan Am reunions and with individual crewmembers and employees of Pan Am conducting videotaped interviews for the mission's companion documentary. However, as of 2014, no search or recovery had been attempted, with the most recent news from 2011 suggesting that the company was still in need of at least US$8 million to get the plan under way.There is a life-size 314 mockup at the Foynes Flying Boat Museum, Foynes, County Limerick, Ireland. The museum is at the site of the original transatlantic flying-boat terminus.\n\n\n== Specifications (314A Clipper) ==\n\nData from Jane's Fighting Aircraft of World War IIGeneral characteristics\nCrew: 11, including 2 cabin stewards\nCapacity: 68 day passengers and/or 36 sleeping passengers / 5 short tons (4,536 kg) of mail and or cargo\nLength: 106 ft (32 m)\nWingspan: 152 ft (46 m)\nHeight: 20 ft 4.5 in (6.210 m)\nAirfoil: root:  NACA 0018; tip: NACA 0010\nEmpty weight: 48,400 lb (21,954 kg)\nGross weight: 84,000 lb (38,102 kg)\nFuel capacity: 5,408 US gal (4,503 imp gal; 20,470 l) in wing and sponson tanks\nPowerplant: 4 \u00d7 Wright 709C-14AC1 Twin Cyclone 14-cylinder air-cooled radial piston engines, 1,600 hp (1,200 kW)  each\nPropellers: 3-bladed Hamilton Standard fully-feathering constant-speed propellersPerformance\n\nMaximum speed: 210 mph (340 km/h, 180 kn) at 6,200 ft (1,890 m)\nCruise speed: 188 mph (303 km/h, 163 kn) at 66.5% power at 11,000 ft (3,353 m)\nRange: 3,685 mi (5,930 km, 3,202 nmi) normal,  4,900 mi (4,258 nmi; 7,886 km) at maximum loaded weight\n\n\n== See also ==\nNotable appearances in MediaRelated development\n\nBoeing XB-15Aircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era\n\nDornier Do X\nLat\u00e9co\u00e8re 521\nMartin M-130\nSaunders-Roe Princess\nShort Empire\nShort S.26\nRelated lists\n\nList of aircraft of World War II\nList of seaplanes and amphibious aircraft\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Boeing 314\nPan American Clippers 1931\u20131946\nBoeing 314\nBoeing 314\nBoeing 314\nLIFE colour photo camouflaged Clipper La Guardia Marine Terminal ca.1942\nLIFE photo essay (comprehensive)'Pan American Clipper Ship' includes NC18605 in a glass doored hangar 1940\nLIFE photo Pan Am skipper flying the 314\nLIFE photo essay 'Pan American Clipper'includes Eve Curie leading pax off Clipper at Lisbon 1940\n[1][2]  LIFE photos NC18602 in Singapore Harbour 1941\nChina Clipper 75th Anniversary Commemorative Flight (November 2010 \u2013 San Francisco Aeronautical Society)\n\"Two Day Turn Around\", February 1941 article\n\"Three Deck Clipper Has Aisle In Wings\", Popular Mechanics, August 1937, early article on Pan American Airways new airliner for trans-ocean flight\n\"New York To Europe By Clipper\",  Popular MechanicsMay 1939, large article with cutaway drawing of interior\n\"Sailors of the Sky\", Popular Mechanics, December 1940, detailed article with photos on flight deck operations of the Boeing 314",

          "We enjoyed our tour of the Foynes Flying Boat Museum. It is a guided tour by lovely knowledgeable curators. It means much more when you are given the back story for the items on display. The plane itself is quite amazing. We also very much enjoyed the Expert Irish coffee demo. A",
          "What\u2019s this we thought? Pulled into the parking lot, paid our admission and discovered a great little piece of aviation history. The phenomenon of the global flying boat service only lasted about ten years and the Foynes museum does an excellent job of presenting that history,",
          "A fantastic history to the flying boats of old sitituated on the n69 foynes port town offers a great look into the history and tour of the historic events of the first ever landing of a flying boat in Ireland.",
          "My husband is a pilot and always finds an aviation museum or air field to visit no matter where we travel. This plane was very interesting to me. I wish that trans-Atlantic flights were so comfortable today! We ate lunch in the attached restaurant. The sandwiches were tast.",
          "We heard about this wonderful place from friends who had traveled in Ireland last year. We decided to explore, and we\u2019re so glad we did! This should be a \u201cmust-do\u201d stop for anyone who loves aviation or history. The museum is not overly large, but it tells the fascinating",
          "We have been here a number of times over the last few years and is a place we always make sure to visit. The food and coffee is always good and fresh along with pleasant atmosphere with a friendly service it make a great experience of Irish hospitality",
          "This was a bus tour rest spot. The bus driver needed the designated rest time. The museum is interesting enough but it was a little long. The herd you like sheep. Everything is planned out. Movie, take lunch order, guided tour, eat lunch, learn how to make Irish coffee,",
          "We did the guided tour of this museum which was very informative and quite interesting. Our guide Mary was great fun and we suggest you ask for her as she seems quite knowledgeable and entertaining. Do watch the Irish Coffee demonstration at the end, especially if it is given",
          "We visited the 1930/40s cafe whilst visiting Foynes. Ordered a cheese and ham toastie which was nice and came with crisps. I wouldn't day the cafe was retro though",
          "We had time to kill before the next ferry so decided to take a run up to Foynes to have a look at this. We ended up missing the next 2 ferries cos it was that good. And that was without stopping in the cafe ! Have passed many times but underestimated the amazing history.Highly",

          "What a gem. I new about flying boats used in the war, but new nothing about the commercial side of flying them. As for stationing ships across the Atlantic with searchlights on just so they could find their way, mind blowing. This is not a vast museum but it gets all the info",
          "When I saw the description of this museum, I was not very enthusiastic about visiting it, but boy, was I mistaken. Our bus group was first herded into a small theater where we were greeted by Helen and our lunch orders were taken. Odd system but it proved to be well thought",

          "Interesting stop for a few hours to understand the flying boat era but the entrance fee can be a bit daunting if you're on a budget! That said, it's exhibits are well put together and tell the story of the flying boat era in a clear and logical way.",
          "For those interested in the history of early aviation the Foynes Flying boat museum gives a comprehensive record of air travel at that time, in particular for Atlantic ocean crossings. The exhibits in the museum are extremely well displayed over a number of floors and within",
          "We spent a lovely couple of hours at the Foynes Flying boat Museum. It was most enjoyable and enlightening. We were met by a lovely lady by the name of Ursula, who brought us to the cinema to watch a short film about the Flying Boats. After wandering around the 4 floors of the",

          "Our two sons and their partners were visiting us from England and Easter Monday was a wet, cold and grey day. Definitely a day for a visit to an indoor attraction that would catch everyone's interest. Prior to their visit I had contacted the museum via their Facebook page with a",
          "Stopped in Foynes to visit the Museum while on a tour of Ireland - so glad we did. The tour was very interesting and informative. And then to have the chance to not only see up close an actual replica of the plane - but to go inside too - Outstanding. And don\u2019t miss the Irish",

          "Very nice museum about the golden age of flying, takes you back into the 1930s and 1940s when the UK and the US were competing for long range flights with flying boats. Also teaches you about how the small town of Foynes ties into this history. Starts with a short c10 min film",
          "Very well worth the stop for a few hours. Fascinating History well told using exhibits, posters & film in an ideal setting where you amble through at your own pace. Very friendly & informative staff are an extra bonus. There is an on-site cafe/snack bar & souvenir shop.",
          "Tucked away nto this tiny town is the Flying Boat Museum, which offers an interesting view into that magical time of the flying boats of the late 1930s. The museum tour starts with a 10 minute film and ends with a walk about of the tower. The museum and tower are the original",
          "This is a good example of what a museum should be; smart, compact, easy to understand, and well thought out. Even if you don\u2019t think you are interested in flying boats it\u2019s just a great museum that won\u2019t overwhelm, but interest you in the people who got flying boats from this",
          "Interesting enough visif for kids and adults alike. It is located in a pretty enough but otherwise passable village on the coast road. The plane looks a bit odd at the side of the museum but really adds a lot to the content of the museum. Good museum to kill a couple of hours",

          "Foynes Flying Boat Museum is a gem of a museum. We visited with elderly folks (75 and 87) and they absolutely LOVED it for its nostalgia of a bygone era. It is a well thought out museum with just the right amount of information, fascinating exhibits and memorabilia, touches of",

          "This venue was included in our tour of Ireland. It was very interesting, but a little out of the way. I wouldn't go out of my way to see it. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable on the history of the flying boats that took off from this area for the USA before the start of",
          "We had a family event on this October and due to the amount of people we had coming, we felt that the Museum in Foynes would be the best option. I had heard good things, but they went way beyond my expectation in hospitality, helpfulness and location. From the day we booked the",

          "Great place to visit. We had been here years ago when it was just the radio room & a couple of other things to see. Now it has an audiovisual room, a lot of info about the seaplanes, a flight simulator where you can take off, fly around & land in the water again. The replica of",

        "wiki": "Adare (; Irish: \u00c1th Dara, meaning \"ford of [the] oak\") is a village in County Limerick, Ireland, located south-west of the city of Limerick. Renowned as one of Ireland's prettiest towns, Adare is designated as a heritage town by the Irish government.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe River Maigue is tidal as far as Adare, with the settlement forming around the eastern bank of the Maigue overlooking the fording point from which the village gets its name. An annalistic reference is made in the medieval Annals of Inisfallen at AI982.4 \"The Tree of Mag Adar was broken by Leth Cuinn\". Owing to the strategic importance of the river crossing the Desmond castle was built overlooking the site near Ardshanbally (derived from Ard an tSeanbhaile - 'high ground of the old town'), and was first mentioned in 1226. Historically a market town, in the Middle Ages, Adare boasted three monasteries. Owing to the influence of the Earls of Dunraven, who built the Adare Manor (now a luxury resort hotel) a strict plan was laid out for the town.\n\n\n=== Desmond Castle ===\n\nA castle or fortress is said to have first been built with an ancient ring-fort, by the O'Donovans, rulers of the region into the late 12th century, and afterwards to have passed into the possession of the Kildare branch of the FitzGerald dynasty, who may be responsible for the majority of the remains of the present fortress (which occurred with Croom Castle, also on the Maigue). Desmond Castle, as it is popularly known, stands on the north bank of the Maigue. An extensive renovation has been in progress on the castle since 1996 and supervised tours are offered in the summer months.  This is one of a series of significant Desmond properties, which also include Desmond Hall and Castle in Newcastle West, another castle in Askeaton and Castle Matrix near Rathkeale, further west in County Limerick.\n\n\n=== Augustinian Priory ===\n\nAdare's Augustinian Priory was founded in 1316 by John FitzThomas FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Kildare. The Priory was suppressed in the reign of Henry VIII. In 1807, the church of the Priory was given to the local Church of Ireland congregation as the parish church. In 1814, the refectory was roofed and converted into a schoolhouse. Between 1852 and 1854, a second restoration of the church was undertaken by Caroline, Countess of Dunraven.\n\n\n=== Franciscan Abbey ===\nThe Franciscan friary was founded in 1464 by Thomas Fitz-Maurice, 7th Earl of Kildare and his wife Joan, and completed two years later. It is currently a ruin and is located inside the Adare Manor Golf Club.\n\n\n=== Trinitarian Abbey ===\n\nThe Trinitarian Order established their only monastery in Ireland in Adare in 1230. It is believed that the Trinitarian monks who came to Adare may have come from Scotland. The Abbey was restored in 1811 by the first Earl of Dunraven as the Catholic Parish church.\n\n\n=== Adare Manor ===\nAdare Manor is a mansion located on lands on the banks of the River Maiguem and the former seat of the Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl. The present building was built in the early 19th-century in a Tudor-revival style, while retaining part of an earlier structure. It is now the Adare Manor Hotel & Golf Resort, a luxury resort hotel, reopened after an extensive restoration in October 2017.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe main street combines typical Irish architecture with the English styled buildings and infrastructure purpose-built for the Dunraven estate. Examples of the latter architectural forms include the thatched cottages near the entrance to Adare Manor.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAdare is a tourist destination and the local heritage centre, which gives insight into the history of the village, also hosts a number of craft shops. The village is a wedding and conference venue. Adare has two 18-hole golf courses - the Adare Golf Club, which incorporates a driving range and which was the site of the 2007 and 2008 Irish Open, the Adare Manor Golf Club and a pitch and putt course. Adare also has an equestrian centre, located  in Clonshire.\n\n\n=== Schools ===\nThere are four primary schools in Adare: St Joseph's National School (Catholic, boys), Our Lady's Abbey National School (Catholic, girls), St Nicholas' National School (Church of Ireland, mixed) and Shountrade National School (Catholic, mixed). The village's secondary school, Adare CBS, closed in 1973.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nThe main Limerick-Tralee road, the N21 passes through the village, causing persistent heavy congestions.  In late 2015 a corridor for the long-delayed bypass was chosen that realigns the N21 road north of the village as part of a new dual carriageway planned to link Foynes port to Limerick.\nAdare is a stop on Bus \u00c9ireann's Limerick-Tralee/Killarney bus service and Dublin Coach's Dublin-Tralee/Killarney service. Both run hourly.\nThe abandoned \"Limerick-Foynes\" railway line passes 800 metres (half a mile) to the north-west of the town. Adare railway station, opened on 12 July 1856 by the Limerick & Foynes Railway company, was closed to passengers on 4 February 1963 and to freight on 2 December 1974. The line to Foynes continued to carry freight traffic until it was mothballed in 2001 and has seen no trains since 7 May 2002 when the annual Irish Rail weedspray train visited the line. The line, designated an engineers siding, is still officially open for traffic.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nAdare GAA club was founded in 1929. The senior hurling team has won the county championship in 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 and 2009. In football, the Club won the County Intermediate Football Title in 2016 and gained promotion back to The Limerick Senior Football Championship. In 2017, Adare won the County Senior Title for the first time, beating Newcastle West in the Final. In 2018, the club went on to retain the title, becoming the first team in Limerick GAA history to win 2 senior titles immediately following success at intermediate level.\nThe local soccer team is Adare United AFC. The club play at Deer Park Field, situated just off the Blackabbey Road in the village. Founded in 1937, Adare has one of the oldest soccer clubs outside Limerick city. Adare United participate in the Limerick Desmond Schoolboys/Girls League at Under 8, U10, U12, U14 and U16 age groups and in the Limerick Desmond League at Junior (adult) and Youth level. The 2006/07 Season saw the club form its first ladies team, who compete in the Limerick Desmond Ladies League. In the 2009/10 Season, the ladies were runners up in the League Cup, losing on penalties to Glin Rovers FC. The team were also cup finalists the following year, this time in the Desmond Cup but were beaten by Murroe FC. The Under 10 team were Division 3 Champions in the 2008/09 season and Division 4 winners in 2010/11. The Under 8 team completed a league and cup double in 2010/11. The Junior team won promotion from Division Two in the 2008/2009 season and immediately gained promotion to the premier league the following year. Adare Ladies won the Desmond Cup in the 2011/2012 season and were runners-up in League Division 1.\nThe Irish Open golf championship was staged there in 2007 and 2008. There are two 18-hole golf courses in the village: The Adare Golf Club which is on the grounds of the Adare Manor Hotel, and the Adare Manor Golf Club, which is a separate entity.\nThe Limerick Cricket Club play in the manor fields complex to the south of the village.\nThe town also plays a role in the West Limerick athletics scene, with it hosting the Adare 10K run every February since 1994.\n\n\n== Twin towns ==\nAdare has twinning connections to its sister towns in Germany.\n\nBuchloe, Germany\nBuckow, Germany\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of towns and villages in Ireland\nNicholas Peacock\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAdare Heritage Centre\nShannon Region Tourism's page on Adare\nGeneral Information on Adare\nObituary of the 7th Earl of Dunraven, Thady Wyndham-Quin\nIndex of the Earl of Dunraven Papers at the University of Limerick\nAdare local area plan (Limerick County Council)(2002)\nThe Tidy Towns of Ireland \"Celebrating 50 years\"\nKnockpatrick Gardens\nBunbury, Turtle, Adare Manor: The Renaissance of an Irish Country House (Adare Manor Publishing, 2019) ISBN 9781527246706",

          "We were very surprised to find so many neat shops inside. Yes, it is the Heritage Century but it\u2019s not the least bit stuffy. Wonderful Irish Pewter is available in at least one class act shop. Verpassen Sie nicht diesen stop. Es ist kein eigentliches Museum sondern mehr Info",
          "We stopped off in the Heritage Centre for a quick visit to the gift shop and a bite to eat. We had a pot of tea and a coffee, a gluten free tuna and sweet corn bap ( delish) and a bun. 14\u20ac. A lovely pleasant young lady served us. Service was quick and efficient.",
          "This place is much more than just a visitor information centre with clean toilets - there are numerous retail outlets, selling Irish wares and souvenirs, plus eating choices. It is near the Trinitarian Abbey (well worth a visit as well.) There is plenty of car parking available",

          "Heritage means connecting the past to the present. What is here now and what does it tell us about the past. The Adare \"heritage center\" tries to be a museum, restaurant, dry goods shop, information center and tourist services location all wrapped into one. In my opinion, this",
          "As well as having a tourist information office and shopping opportunities, the centre also hosts an exhibition of Adare's history, which sets the place in context. You can also book guided tours of the Desmond Castle, which is otherwise closed to the public.",

          "There are three shops inside the center. Free bathrooms with plenty of free parking behind the center. There is a free and interesting exhibit of the history of the area inside the center. Lots of touristy souvenirs. The staff in the visitors center are very knowledgeable",
          "This was a very nice pit stop on our way to Limerick. There main street is very cute with some gift shops, pubs and restaurants. Adare is supposed to be Irelands prettiest village. They have a beautiful garden across the street from their information centre.",
          "Had a lovely lunch here today. Its our usual stop off point on our trips to Limerick. Good food at reasonable prices and friendly staff. Good size portions and pleasant a athmosphere.",
          "Now this is done really well. We loved our stop here and apart from the very good displays, we thought the toilets were very well kept. A 'tourist trap' is where you are surprised by the cost. Here this is not the case and if you want to buy fine. I find that many bus loads of",
          "Stopped here to use the bathroom and get a snack. prices were a bit high but the little museum/ information center was neat.",
          "Stale cake, vending machine coffee, vacant service, motorway services prices. Probably the worst place in the village.",
          "Every time you get personal service, you are attended with perfect attitude and never forceful attitude.",
          "My kids (12yr, 10yr, 8yr) and I really enjoyed this tour (Adare Castle), the fact that only 18 of you get to access this castle at any one time really makes this a very real and personal experience.As the bus pulls up to the wooden door and our tour guide Vera got out to open",
          "We visited Adare, and stopped in at the Heritage Center. The exhibit was extremely well done. In addition, we signed up for a guided tour of the Adare Castle. The guide, Sandra, was incredible in her depth and breadth of knowldege, as well as her sense of humor The group has",
          "First of all it is a nice village but this Heritage Center is really just a gift shop and had little or no information on the area. It is a good place to stop for toilets.",
          "The Heritage Centre offers a variety of services -- a tourist information desk, several shops, a cafe, a small museum/exhibit and an ice cream stand. I found the shops to be quite good, and the exhibits were interesting. There is one shop that offers helpful advice on tracing",
          "We weren't even aware of this centre until we went walking in the village yesterday. There is an interesting array of shops in the centre, but all tourist-orientated - and we rambled on in to the display they had constructed. I have to agree with another reviewer, far too many",
          "we have visited the heritage centre many times with my husbands grandmother as she just loves the shops and history in it. We make sure to bring her every Christmas and she always loves it.",
          "We found the details of this on a tourist map. Parking was a bit of an issue. A lot of the space was taken up by coaches waiting to take visitors to the castle or on to other attractions. Ther are a couple of shops in here, a cafe and toilets. There is an exhibition that feels",
          "Good historic information but needs to be brought up to date using modern presentation tools. Not interesting enough for electronically motivated teenagers.",
          "As a wheelchair user I can say this place is well planned and layed out. I can self-propel / scoot & there was plenty of room indoors to explore and read the information without getting in the way. I was here with our brass band to play an afternoon concert which was immense fun",
          "Tour guide was very knowledgeable! Very interesting tour of a Norman castle! Ashleigh was very knowledgeable and personable. Only 1-hour.",
          "The Heritage center is nice with great bathrooms, visitor information a very nice visual history walk-though.",
          "For 6 euro, this bus and guided tour was a bargain. For an hour, Vera, our guide (who confessed to me her age, older than anyone in our group which I mention only because she was so spry and lively throughout the tour), demonstrated to us the probable uses of various parts of",
          "great meeting place and very busy with tour buses and it was hard to get a seat if you wanted to have a coffee. Plenty of parking at the back. Ice cream cones were delicious!!",
          "Dropped in here to break a long car journey, so delighted we did, the whole experience was 5 star from beginning to end. Beautiful restaurant with the most delicious apple pie i have tasted in years. My wife description of the scones was \" absolutely heavenly\" The staff",
          "We enjoyed tour of the Castle.....our tour guide ASHLING was excellent....tour is FREE on the first Wednesday of each month.....bus goes from Heritage Centre!",
          "We popped into the Dovecote restaurant on Friday on the way home from holidays. We usually go there every time we pass but on this occasion we were utterly disappointed. The staff were so rude and unfriendly, in particular the younger staff. We sat down at 4pm and only three",
          "We utilized this site for free parking, bathrooms and shops. The exhibit of the area's history is lacking.",
          "Popped in on our tour of adare, decided to pop into the cafe for a quick bite, and it was excellent lovely fruit scone with jam & butter, lovely freshly cooked it was delicious, so not in this part that fen, so will make a point on returning when I'm in and around Limerick in",

          "Popped in with the family and did the tour of the castle. Great service and reception by the tour guide and centre staff. Intimate tour, very knowledgeable and fun guide and driver. Mini bus was lovely and new and they helped with our double stroller and toddlers.",
          "Definitely a one to avoid. A nasty tourist trap selling commercially produced tat ... ahmm souvenirs ... at inflated prices and with a very underwhelming cafe. Really a blot on the landscape in rather a pretty, if very touristy, village.",
          "Once parked in Adare, it is a nice walking town. The heritage center is a wonderful place to get an overall idea about Adare",
          "The heritage centre is right in the middle of Adare village, accessible from the main street, or from the rear via the free car park. Whatever you need to know about Adare, this is the place to ask. There is a small Norman exhibition and history of the area in the Heritage",
          "There was an interesting exhibition of Irish artifacts and an explanation of the history of surrounding area. There were many cultural items for sale as well as Arran knitwear and other items of clothing. Adare itself is also a women's fashion centre and the gardens all around",
          "we stopped here on our tour to cliffs of moher, its just so informative and relaxin place to spend few minutes,",
          "The food within these walls should not be served to living people! We ordered the cod plate and the salmon quiche. The food was cold, the fish had seen better days and the chips were the bottom of the barrel. The \"salad\".....well, I had to carefully remove it from my mouth.",
          "The center itself is just a shopping center in the middle of the village. Convenient and with a lot of information but nothing special. (I.E. the average rating). Adare itself, however well deserves its reputation as one of the pretties village in Ireland (an excellent rating).",
          "You will find a little bit of everything you need at the Adare Heritage Centre. From tourist information on what to see, where to stay, and what to do to an excellent cafe/restaurant inside where I had a delicious strained & pureed vegetable soup along with the typical Irish",
          "Excellent centre with very helpful and friendly staff, lots to see, do and buy! One very helpful lady even suggested our next stop for that night and booked our accommodation (Kinsale, which was great). As far as the thatched cottages go, they are lovely but not quite as",
          "Plenty to see and do and enjoy. Parking outside so good to know as parking in the street may be a bit tricky. The Guinness Ice Cream was a must!!",
          "We needed help printing our boarding passes. The library next door had just closed. A woman (I suspect she was in charge of the center) could not have been more helpful. She went out of her way to figure it out for us. I would not hesitate to go back!",
          "Clean rooms, delicious breakfast. This was our first stop on our trip to Ireland. Enjoyed Kilkenny Castle and grounds that is within walking distance of the hotel.",
          "The employees at this facility are well-versed in the area, providing resources and suggestions for \"must sees\" in town. They are genuinely interested in visitors and do their best to guide you toward things of interest. We had a wonderful tour of Adare Castle and learned a",
          "The Heritage Centre has a fascinating history of Adare and is well worth going through. The shops have a great selection of reasonably priced souvenirs and fun trinkets. Don't miss it if you're in Adare.",
          "The 'museum' part surprisingly was not very good - very amateurish. The 'guard' (or was he a tour guide?) was friendly and knowledgeable. The shopping selections were nice. Didn't go in the cafe.",
          "This is a lovely shop, full of high quality Irish goods, including tweed jackets and handwoven scarfs and blankets. Easy shipping to the United States.",
          "A few little shops inside - great for shopping for yourself or for your friends/family while visiting!",
          "We came to Adare by bus after flying into Shannon Airport in the wee hours of the morning. The Heritage Center was just the right-size for a groggy visit between napping and going to bed early. I liked the history museum a lot -- small and really helpful for learning about",
          "Right in the middle of town. It has a few shops a place to get information. The most important thing is the large parking lot right behind it. You can park here then walk around town.",

          "Stopped at the Heritage center on a Sunday for a leisurely lunch, The food was quite good and reasonably priced. It was busy with tourists and locals attending church services around 1200 hours. There are shops to visit and the town can be walked at a slow pace. Worth the",
          "We stopped by to check the touristic center and stepped into this lovely restaurant. They had gluten free sandwiches and desserts, also to take away. We ordered both and after barely 5 minutes we had them ready to go and enjoy a nice picnic in the park just across the street.",

          "Bad service Small open sandwich as was just a piece of bread with some cold tuna ( really cold) and some cheese and sweet corn. If you continue like this, in 2 months you are closed! Good luck with that!",

          "We had a short stop in Adare and had the opportunity to visit the Heritage Center. It is a small, but, informative facility. I particularly enjoyed the section that contained the timeline of the history of Adare. The expanded information regarding the history of the cathedrals",
          "Very nice heritage center for a town the size of Adare. The shops in the center aren't necessarily a place to find value for your money. But, it's okay if you're just passing through town and it has great information.",
          "The Adare Heritage Centre is a great place to shop. The lady that works in the store with the sweaters, is excellent. She has a great eye for what will work for someone. She was very helpful and friendly. The other stores carry items that are good gifts for friends and family",

          "Adare is charming with many nature attractions. It's worth stopping by to learn a bit of Irish history, especially the impact the Normans and the English had. The exhibits aren't always working -- they need some TLC and tourist's dollars. But we give them credit for trying to",

          "Dropped in here in late 2015 and found it to be an open friendly centre with lots of pretty typical products on sale. Nothing wrong with typical but nothing novel. Friendly staff and a good hot cup of tea on a bad winter's day. Worth a look.",

          "The food was mediocre and we had vouchers for three breakfasts there as part of our tour package. We opted to not return for the other breakfasts. That being said, the staff were very attentive, polite and helpful. The restaurant was clean and neat and perhaps had we ordered",

        "wiki": "Limerick (; Irish: Luimneach [\u02c8l\u032a\u02e0\u026am\u02b2(\u0259)n\u02b2\u0259x]) is a city in County Limerick, Ireland. It is located in the Mid-West Region and is also part of the province of Munster. With a population of 94,192 at the 2016 census, Limerick is the third-most populous urban area in the state, and the fourth-most populous city on the island of Ireland. The city lies on the River Shannon, with the historic core of the city located on King's Island, which is bounded by the Shannon and Abbey Rivers. Limerick is also located at the head of the Shannon Estuary, where the river widens before it flows into the Atlantic Ocean. Limerick City and County Council is the local authority for the city.\n\n\n== Geography and political subdivisions ==\nAt the 2016 census, the Metropolitan District of Limerick had a population of 104,952. On 1 June 2014 following the merger of Limerick City and County Council, a new Metropolitan District of Limerick was formed within the united council, which extended the city area. The Metropolitan District includes the city urban area and extends outwards towards Patrickswell in the west and Castleconnell in the east. The City Metropolitan Area however excludes city suburbs located within County Clare.\nLimerick is one of the constituent cities of the Cork\u2013Limerick\u2013Galway corridor, which has a population of 1 million people. It is located at a strategic position on the River Shannon with four main crossing points near the city centre. To the south of the city is the Golden Vale, an area of rich pastureland. Historically, much of the city's industry was based on this rich agricultural hinterland, and it is particularly noted for Limerick ham.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient and medieval history ===\nLuimneach originally referred to the general area along the banks of the Shannon Estuary known as Loch Luimnigh. The earliest settlement in the city, Inis Sibhtonn, was the original name for King's Island during the pre-Viking and Viking eras. This island was also called Inis an Ghaill Duibh, 'The Dark-(haired) Foreigner's Island'. The name is recorded in Viking sources as Hlymrekr.\nThe city dates from 812; however, history suggests the presence of earlier settlements in the area surrounding King's Island, the island at the historical city centre. Antiquity's map-maker, Ptolemy, produced in 150 the earliest map of Ireland, showing a place called Regia at the same site as King's Island. History also records an important battle involving Cormac mac Airt in 221 and a visit by Saint Patrick in 434 to baptise an E\u00f3ganachta king, Carthann the Fair. Saint Munchin, the first bishop of Limerick died in 652, indicating the city was a place of some note. In 812 the Vikings sailed up the Shannon and pillaged the city, burned the monastery of Mungret but were forced to flee when the Irish attacked and killed many of their number. The Normans redesigned the city in the 12th century and added much of the most notable architecture, such as King John's Castle and St Mary's Cathedral.In early medieval times Limerick was at the centre of the Kingdom of Thomond which corresponds to the present day County Clare, the Kingdom also included North Kerry and parts of South Offaly. One of the kingdom's most notable kings was Brian Boru, ancestor of the O'Brien Clan of Dalcassians. The word Thomond is synonymous with the region and is retained in place names such as Thomondgate, Thomond Bridge and Thomond Park.\n\n\n=== Late Renaissance/Early modern history ===\n\nLimerick in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was often called the most beautiful city in Ireland. The English-born judge Luke Gernon, a resident of Limerick, wrote in 1620 that at his first sight of the city he had been amazed at its magnificence: \"lofty buildings of marble, like the Colleges in Oxford\".During the civil wars of the 17th century the city played a pivotal role, besieged by Oliver Cromwell in 1651 and twice by the Williamites in the 1690s. The Treaty of Limerick ended the Williamite war in Ireland which was fought between supporters of the Catholic King James II (Jacobites) and the Protestant King William of Orange (Williamites). The treaty offered toleration to Catholicism and full legal rights to Catholics that swore an oath of loyalty to William III and Mary II. The Treaty was of national significance as it ensured closer British and Protestant dominance over Ireland. The articles of the Treaty protecting Catholic rights were not passed by the Protestant Irish Parliament which rather updated the Penal Laws against Catholics which had major implications for Irish history. Reputedly the Treaty was signed on the Treaty Stone, an irregular block of limestone which once served as a mounting block for horses. This stone is now displayed on a pedestal at Clancy Strand. Because of the treaty, Limerick is sometimes known as the Treaty City. This turbulent period earned the city its motto: urbs antiqua fuit studisque asperrima belli (an ancient city well studied in the arts of war).\nThe peaceful times that followed the turmoil of the late 17th century allowed the city to prosper through trade in the late 18th century. During this time Limerick Port established itself as one of Ireland's major commercial ports exporting agricultural produce from one of Ireland's most fertile areas, the Golden Vale, to Britain and America. This increase in trade and wealth, particularly amongst the city's merchant classes saw a rapid expansion of the city as Georgian Limerick began to take shape. This gave the city its present-day look including the extensive terraced streets of Georgian townhouses which remain in the city centre today. The Waterford and Limerick Railway linked the city to the Dublin\u2013Cork railway line in 1848 and to Waterford in 1853. The opening of a number of secondary railways in the subsequent decades developed Limerick as a regional centre of communications.  However, the economic downturn in the European conflicts of the French Revolution and Napoleonic eras, and following the Act of Union 1800, and the impact of the Great Irish Famine of 1848 caused much of the 19th century to be a more troubled period.\n\n\n=== 20th-century history ===\n\nThe Limerick boycott was an economic boycott waged against the small Jewish community for over two years in the first decade of the 20th century. It was accompanied by a number of assaults, stone throwing and intimidation, which caused many Jews to leave the city. It was instigated in 1904 by a Redemptorist priest, Father John Creagh.\nDuring the Irish War of Independence, the Limerick Soviet was a self-declared soviet that existed from 15 to 27 April 1919. A general strike was organised by the Limerick Trades and Labour Council, as a protest against the British Army's declaration of a \"Special Military Area\" under the Defence of the Realm Act, which covered most of Limerick city and a part of the county. During the strike a special strike committee was set up to print their own money, control food prices and publish newspapers.\nBy the mid-20th century, Limerick was characterised by economic stagnation and decline as many traditional industries closed or left the city. However, there were some success stories. In 1942 Shannon Airport (located in County Clare, 20 km west of the city) opened for the first time offering transatlantic flights. In 1959, Shannon Airport enabled the opening of the Shannon Free Zone which attracted a large number of multinational companies to the region. A long campaign for a third level educational institute to be located in the city finally bore fruit with the establishment of NIHE Limerick in 1969 which eventually became the University of Limerick in 1989.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nThe local government area of Limerick city is under the jurisdiction of Limerick City and County Council. The Council has responsibility for local services such as sanitation, planning and development, libraries, collection of motor taxation, local roads and social housing in the city. The council comprises elected ward Councillors with an appointed full-time CEO as the city (and county) manager. Local elections are held every five years and the Councillors annually elect a Cathaoirleach or chairman to chair the council. As of 2015, the Cathaoirleach was Cllr Liam Galvin from the Newcastle West electoral area. The 21 Councillors from the 3 electoral districts in the City Metropolitan Area also elect a mayor to represent the city. The Mayoral position is largely ceremonial and has much reduced responsibility following the merger of the Limerick local authorities. Although the Mayor is the city's first citizen, within the council the position is below that of the Cathaoirleach. The current mayor is Councillor Jerry O'Dea. Former well-known mayors include TDs Donogh O'Malley, Stephen Coughlan, Michael Lipper, Jim Kemmy and Jan O'Sullivan.Throughout most of the city's history; from 1197 when it gained its first charter, Limerick City had its own local government authority, Limerick Corporation later known as Limerick City Council. The council was one of the oldest in Ireland and was only exceeded in age by Dublin City Council. In October 2012 the Government of Ireland published Putting People First- Action Programme for Effective Local Government which set out Government policy for reforms across all the main areas of local government in Ireland. Among the recommendations was the merging of Limerick City Council with Limerick County Council. The changes came into effect on 1 June 2014 following the implementation of the Local Government Reform Act 2014.By the 1960s onwards the city had outgrown its boundary considerably; the city boundary was only altered slightly and never reflected the overall urban area of the city. A limited boundary extension on the city's north side in 2008 enlarged the city boundary by 1,020 hectares increasing the city's area by almost 50% and raising the population by an estimated 7,000. The previous boundary, encompassing 2,086 hectares, was delineated in 1950. Newer suburban districts such as Dooradoyle, Castletroy \u2013 including the University, Gouldavoher, and Raheen were continually administered to by Limerick County Council until the merger of the two authorities in June 2014. This local government structure in Limerick caused a number of inefficiencies, most notably in the area of planning. A number of suburbs such as Westbury and Parteen to the north of the city are governed by Clare County Council.\nFollowing the merger of the two authorities in 2014 a new Metropolitan District of Limerick City was set up that included the city urban area and also settlements close to the city such as Patrickswell and Castleconnell. The Metropolitan district returns 21 Councillors to Limerick City and County Council which in total has 40 Councillors returned from across Limerick City and County. The Limerick City Metropolitan District is divided into 3 wards or electoral areas which are; Limerick City East, Limerick City North and Limerick City South which elect eight, six and seven Councillors respectively.Following the 2019 local elections, Fine Gael was the largest party on the united authority with 13 seats followed by Fianna F\u00e1il with 12, Labour with 3, Sinn F\u00e9in and the Green Party (Ireland) with 2 each, the Social Democrats with 1 seat, and Independents and other parties the remaining 6 seats.For national D\u00e1il elections Limerick City is in the Limerick City constituency. From 2011, the constituency boundaries changed in accordance with the proposals of the Constituency Commission and the subsequent Electoral (Amendment) Act 2009. This changed the electoral boundaries from Limerick East and Limerick West to Limerick City and Limerick. Limerick city encompasses the city, the suburban areas of Castletroy and as far east as Castleconnell. It also includes part of south County Clare. The Limerick county constituency takes in most of the rest of the county. For European parliament elections Limerick is in South Ireland.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nLimerick's climate is classified as temperate oceanic (K\u00f6ppen Cfb). Met \u00c9ireann maintains a climatological weather station at Shannon Airport, 20 kilometres west of the city in County Clare. Shannon Airport records an average of 977 millimetres of precipitation annually, most of which is rain. Limerick has a mild climate, with the average daily maximum in July of 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) and the average daily minimum in January of 3 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F). The highest temperature recorded was 32.0 \u00b0C (89.6 \u00b0F) in June 2018, and the lowest \u221211.4 \u00b0C (11.5 \u00b0F) in 2010. Limerick is the cloudiest city in the state, averaging only 1,295 sunshine hours annually, 3.5 hours of sunshine every day. There are on average 62 days of no recordable sunshine, 6 days of thunder, 22 days of hail and 11 days of snow per year. Shannon Airport is located by the ocean at an elevation of 14 metres, so snow is less common at the station than in the city itself.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn 2014, Limerick became Ireland's inaugural National City of Culture, with a variety of artistic and cultural events occurring at locations around the city throughout the year.\nThe Limerick City Gallery of Art on Pery Square is the city's chief venue for contemporary art exhibitions. It is home to a permanent collection of Irish art, which shows works from the early 18th to 20th century. The gallery houses the National Collection of Contemporary Drawing founded by the artist Samuel Walsh in 1987. Limerick's major contemporary art event is EVA International, Ireland's Biennial of Contemporary Art. EVA International, centered mainly in the Limerick City Gallery of Art, is curated by varying guest curators and includes contemporary artworks by both international and Irish artists.The Lime Tree Theatre officially opened at the Mary Immaculate College campus in October 2012. The venue hosts theatre, music, comedy, traditional arts, schools' performances and conferences.The Belltable Arts Centre on O'Connell Street hosts local playwrights and drama productions. The University Concert Hall located in UL is a 1,000 seat venue and provides a large venue for national and international acts to visit the city. Limerick is also the home of street theatre companies, including \"The Umbrella Project\".\nLimerick's literature scene is supported by projects like the Limerick Writers' Centre, which was established in 2008 and runs a range of writing activities in the city. Limerick natives include Pulitzer Prize winning author, Frank McCourt; novelists Kate O'Brien, Michael Curtin, Kevin Barry and Donal Ryan. Poets from Limerick include Michael Hogan, Desmond O'Grady, and John Liddy.Other Limerick arts groups include Contact Studios, which provides individual studio spaces for visual artists; the Daghdha Dance Company, a contemporary dance company that has adopted a renovated church in John's Square, adjacent to St John's Cathedral, as a performance space); the Fresh Film Festival, which is held each spring, and includes films made by young people (7\u201318 years); Impact Theatre Company; and Limerick Printmakers Studio and Gallery, which provides printmaking facilities, a venue for exhibitions and events and an education programme. The Limerick Youth Theatre provides young people with an opening into acting and production.The Irish Chamber Orchestra and the Irish World Music Centre are both based in the University of Limerick. The university has a thousand-seat state-of-the-art concert hall that hosts visiting performers. The city's music scene has produced bands such as The Cranberries, guitarist Noel Hogan's MonoBand, The Hitchers and others. Electronic musician Richard D. James, more commonly known as Aphex Twin, was born in Limerick in 1971. The Limerick Art Gallery and the Art College cater for painting, sculpture and performance art.\nLimerick is also home to comedians The Rubberbandits, D'Unbelievables (Pat Shortt and Jon Kenny) and Karl Spain. Dolan's Warehouse on the Dock Road is a venue specialising in live music, established in 1998. Baker Place was a nightclub that held mainly local underground nights until its closure in 2011. In 2020, it was announced that the Dromkeen-based Shiloh Trust was seeking planning permission to convert the former premises of Baker Place into a bible school. The Crush 87 nightclub (formerly known as Trinity Rooms until its closure in 2010), was relaunched in 2013.The city is the setting for Frank McCourt's memoir Angela's Ashes and the film adaptation. The Frank McCourt Museum situated in Frank's former school on Hartsonge Street opened in 2011 and contains artefacts from the book. Limerick has also been the setting or location for a number of other films, including the dramas The Real Thing (2002), Cowboys & Angels (2003) and Lost & Found (2015).Riverfest is a summer festival held annually in Limerick since 2004. The 2014 festival was held in May and had a record 80,000 visitors.\n\n\n== Humorous verse ==\nA limerick is a type of humorous verse of five lines with an AABBA rhyme scheme: the poem's connection with the city is obscure, but the name is generally taken to be a reference to Limerick city or County Limerick, sometimes particularly to the Maigue Poets, and may derive from an earlier form of nonsense verse parlour game that traditionally included a refrain that included \"Will [or won't] you come (up) to Limerick?\" The earliest known use of the name \"Limerick\" for this type poem is an 1880 reference, in a Saint John, New Brunswick newspaper, to an apparently well-known tune.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Broadcasting ===\nRT\u00c9 lyric fm, a state-run classical music radio station and part of RT\u00c9, broadcasts nationally from studios in the city centre on Cornmarket Square which opened in 1994. Limerick's local radio station is Live 95FM, broadcasting from 'Radio House', near the waterfront at Steamboat Quay. Spin South West, owned by Communicorp, broadcasts to Counties Kerry, Clare, Limerick, Tipperary and southwest Laois from its studios at Landmark Buildings in the Raheen Industrial Estate. Student radio station, Wired FM, broadcasts on 99.9FM from Mary Immaculate College. Wired FM also has studios in Limerick Institute of Technology. University Hospital Limerick has a radio station on 94.2FM, but this can be heard only in the hospital and surrounding area. West Limerick 102 is broadcast from Newcastle West. The national broadcaster, RT\u00c9, has radio and television studios in the city, which are periodically used to broadcast programming from Limerick.\n\n\n=== Print ===\nSeveral local newspapers are published in the city, including The Limerick Post and The Limerick Leader and magazines include the Limerick Event Guide, Business Limerick and Limerick Now.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\nLimerick city is approximately 25 km from Shannon Airport. Tourist attractions in the city centre include Limerick City Museum, King John's Castle (1210), St Mary's Cathedral (1168), the Hunt Museum, the University of Limerick, Georgian houses and gardens and the Treaty Stone.  There are several seasonal tours, including Angela's Ashes walking tour of Limerick City, historical walking tour, and boat tours along the River Shannon.\nThe city centre is divided between the traditional areas of \"English Town\" on the southern end of King's Island, which includes the King John's Castle; \"Irish Town\", which includes the older streets on the south bank; and the current economic centre further south, called \"Newtown Pery\". Newtown Pery was built in the late 18th century before the Act of Union and, unusually for an Irish city and unique in Limerick, is laid out on a grid plan. The Limerick City Museum (formerly aka the Jim Kemmy Municipal Museum), is located in Istabraq Hall, City Hall, Merchant's Quay. It contains displays on Limerick's history and manufactures.\n\nThe Georgian core of the city, with its Georgian architecture in the Newtown Pery, was developed from the mid 18th century. This core includes O'Connell Street (George Street before independence) from the Cecil Street intersection running to the south west end of the Crescent, and south-east to Pery Street including Glentworth Street and Barrington Street. Other buildings of architectural note in the city are St John's Cathedral, designed by the notable Victorian architect, Philip Charles Hardwick. St Mary's Cathedral, at over 800 years old, is one of the oldest in Ireland. St John's Cathedral, whilst more modern, has Ireland's tallest spire at 94 m (308 ft).\nThe Hunt Museum is based in the historic 18th-century former Custom House. The museum was established to house a collection of approximately 2000 works of art and antiquities formed by John and Gertrude Hunt during their lifetimes.\nThe main park in Limerick is the People's Park which was opened in 1877 in memory of Richard Russell, a prominent local business man. The park is dominated by the Thomas Spring Rice memorial (MP for the city 1820\u20131832) and has a large collection of mature deciduous and evergreen trees.\nLimerick city centre changed significantly with the construction of several modern high-rise buildings in the early 2000s, in particular as part of the regeneration of the former docks area along the Dock Road. The suburban areas, where the majority of the population now live, have grown out from the centre along the main roads to Ennis (North Circular and Ennis Road areas/Caherdavin), Dublin (Castletroy and the University) and Cork (Ballinacurra/Dooradoyle/Raheen). Suburban houses are generally two-floor semi-detached homes for single families. These were built from the 1950s onwards in large estates by government projects and commercial developments, although there are many examples of Edwardian and older 1930s suburban homes on the main suburban thoroughfares leading towards the city (North & South Circular, Ballinacurra Road, O'Connell Avenue).\n\nLimerick city's nightlife is supported by a number of nightclubs and pubs which offer music. For example, Dolan's Warehouse is a small music venue which hosts local, national and international folk, indie, jazz, rock and traditional Irish music acts.In County Limerick, Adare village and the Foynes Flying Boat Museum, approximately 35 km (22 miles/30 minutes) from Limerick City along the scenic coastal N69 route from Limerick to Tralee, are also attractions. Bunratty Castle in County Clare is another local attraction, and is situated 15.4 km north of the city. Limerick is known to be the antipodes to the Campbell Islands of New Zealand.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nLimerick is the third largest city in Ireland (after Dublin and Cork) with a population of 94,192 in the urban area and 104,952 in the metropolitan district, according to the 2016 CSO census. The past census reported a large population decline in central city areas due in part to the Limerick regeneration process where in these areas the largest reduction was reported nationally and also to outward migration following the collapse of the local and national economy from 2008 onwards. The population of the Limerick Larger Urban Zone as defined by the EU is 162,413. The ethnic diversity in Limerick's population, which includes a large immigrant community, saw rapid growth during the Celtic Tiger and the following decade. The Polish community is one of the largest demographic groups in the Municipal District, with approximately 4,000 living and working in the area. Ireland's first Polish bank opened in 2007. The African community has set up a number of churches, which are now part of the cultural makeup of the city.Limerick has a large stock of local authority housing. Prior to the merger of Limerick City and County Council 41% of all housing within the old Limerick City Council boundary was local authority, which was the highest in Ireland. This figure is however no longer accurate given the larger metropolitan district of the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nLimerick is in the region dubbed \"the Midwest\". Also known as the \"Shannon Region\", this is primarily an economic and social concept. The region encompasses County Limerick, County Clare, North County Tipperary, Northwest County Kerry and south County Offaly, with its focal point centred on Limerick and its environs within an 8-kilometre (5 mi) radius.\nThe area is the main economic region in Ireland outside Dublin and Cork. Its economic development has been driven in part by the University of Limerick, Limerick Institute of Technology, Shannon Airport in County Clare and Shannon Development (an economic development agency), whose precursor was SFADCO (Shannon Free Airport Development Company), an economic agency that provided tax incentives to companies locating in the area surrounding Shannon Airport. As of 2006 Shannon Development was mostly concerned with disposing of valuable industrial park properties. Limerick Chamber of Commerce, a representative body for businesses in the region, celebrated its bicentennial/bicentenary in 2015.\nHistorically Limerick was an agricultural commodity-driven economy, due to its position as the first major port along the River Shannon. By the middle of the 18th century, Limerick Port grew to become one of Ireland's principal commercial ports, exporting agricultural produce from the most fertile tracts in Ireland known as the Golden Vale as well as produce from the surrounding counties. The city was one of the main meat processing areas in Ireland, and industry included confectionery and flour production. The city was known for its bacon industry \u2013 however this went into decline in the mid-20th century. The fishing industry in Limerick, based on Clancy's Strand opposite King John's Castle and at Coonagh nearby, once employed hundreds of men. The boat most commonly used was the Gandelow which was also used as a small Lighter (barge) to ferry goods to and from larger ships in the port. In the 1920s the construction of a dam at Ardnacrusha severely impacted salmon breeding and that, and the introduction of quotas, had by the 1950s caused salmon fishing to diminish. By 2006, most fishermen had relinquished their drift net licences and the industry can now be said to be dormant.As with other cities in Ireland, a number of multinational companies are based in Limerick, and the city is a growing recipient of foreign direct investment. Dell had its main European Manufacturing Facility at the Raheen Business Park however in January 2009 Dell announced that it would close its Limerick computer manufacturing plant and move the production lines to Poland. The facility was the largest Dell manufacturing plant outside the United States and produced 30,000\u201360,000 units per day for export to the EMEA. Dell remains one of the largest employers in the mid-west with over 1,000 people employed in service and support. Analog Devices has its European manufacturing base in Raheen, 3 km south-west of the city centre. The site employs more than 1,000 people. Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Vistakon (the world's largest manufacturer of contact lenses) has a large facility in Castletroy in the National Technology Park and also employs close to 1,000 people. It is Vistakon's only production facility outside the United States and one of the largest contact-lens manufacturing plants in the world. Cook Medical, the world's largest privately owned Medical Devices company, employs over 800 people in Limerick at the National Technology Park.\nThe Post-2008 Irish economic downturn had a profound effect on Limerick. The announcement in 2009 that Dell was to move its manufacturing facility from Limerick to Poland devastated the local economy. 1,900 jobs were lost at Dell and it is believed that for every job that was lost at Dell at least another 4 to 5 were at risk. The closure of the Dell manufacturing facility amounted to 2% of Ireland's national GDP. The downturn in the construction industry also cost many jobs as did the stalled Limerick regeneration programme which promised investment in Limerick's deprived city areas. As of 2012 unemployment had become a major problem across the city with the unemployment rate in the city at 28.6% which was almost twice the national average.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nThe Crescent Shopping Centre is the largest shopping centre in Ireland, outside of Dublin, and the largest in the province of Munster. It is located in Dooradoyle about 3 km south of the city centre, and has over 90 shopping outlets along with restaurants and a 12-screen Omniplex Cinema. The city centre also has a large retail district which includes a mix of more traditional type of shops as well as some modern high street stores. Cruises Street is one of the main shopping streets. O'Connell Street, William Street, Bedford Row and Thomas Street) are also retail streets within the city. The city centre saw some works on remodelling in the early 21st century, with pedestrianisation works on Bedford Row, Thomas Street and parts of Catherine Street, as well as widening footpaths on William Street. These works have sought to address a reduction of footfall in the city centre (in turn influencing the closure of many city centre retail businesses) which occurred from the recession of 2008 onwards.\n\n\n==== Retail parks and shopping centres ====\n\nDuring the Celtic Tiger years a number of shopping centres and retail parks opened in suburban areas of Limerick. In addition to the Crescent Shopping Centre, which expanded in the early 2000s, the Jetland Shopping Centre opened in Caherdavin in 2005. The Childers Road Retail Park and the Parkway Shopping Centre in the east of the city also have a number of high street stores. Unfinished retail centres include the Coonagh Cross retail development and the Parkway Valley Shopping Centre on the Dublin Road. A proposed but unapproved retail development project, the Opera Centre, makes up part of the \"Limerick 2030\" scheme.\n\n\n==== The Milk Market ====\nThe Milk Market located at Cornmarket Row in the city centre sells locally produced foods and products and is governed by Limerick Market Trustees. In 2010 work was undertaken to redevelop the existing premises to an all-weather, all year round facility as it operated in an outdoor environment. The work involved constructing a large canopy over the existing market premises and was officially re-opened in June 2010. The Milk Market Project won the 2011 Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI) 'Peoples Choice Award'.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nIn 2013, a renewable energy strategy was launched for the region, and proposed a 20% reduction in CO2-emissions, while ensuring that short-term actions were beneficial to the long-term goal of 100% renewable energy. The strategy was completed by the Danish Aalborg University.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\nShannon Airport is 20 km west of the city in County Clare. It is one of Ireland's main airports and is easily accessible from Limerick via the N18 dual carriageway and from other regions via the Limerick Tunnel. It has scheduled flights to European and North American destinations. Airlines using the airport include Ryanair, Aer Lingus, United Airlines, American Airlines, Aer Lingus Regional and Delta Air Lines. There is no rail link to the airport. Coonagh airfield, a few kilometres west of Caherdavin, serves small private aircraft. Kerry and Cork Airports are around 1 hour 30 minutes and 2 hours drive away, respectively.

Vikings established the city as a maritime trading port. The city's position on a major Irish river system, the Shannon, enabled transport to the midlands of Ireland and further north and west. By the 18th century with the opening of canal systems throughout Ireland, Limerick Port established itself as Ireland's premier commercial port on the western side of the country. This was enabled by ease of access from the facilitated by the opening of canals but most importantly to the River Shannon. The opening of the Grand Canal in the 18th century provided further access to Dublin and the east of the country. There are also a number of disused canals in the vicinity of the city including the Park Canal & the Passey \u2013 Errina Canal on the old Limerick navigation. Waterway transport on the Shannon was regularly used to transport goods from Limerick to Dublin and vice versa however this mode of transport fell into decline in the 20th century. Originally Limerick port was located near the confluence of the Abbey and Shannon rivers at King's Island. Today the Shannon Foynes Port is located further downstream on the Shannon alongside the Dock Road. This general purpose facility port is operated by the Shannon Foynes Port Company who operate all marine activities in the Shannon estuary.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nLimerick is a centre of higher education in the region, and technical and continuation education within the city traces its beginning back to the formation of the Limerick Athenaeum Society in 1852, marking the foundation of the Limerick Institute of Technology.

        "wiki": "Lough Gur (Irish: Loch Goir) is a lake in County Limerick, Ireland between the towns of Herbertstown and Bruff. The lake forms a horseshoe shape at the base of Knockadoon Hill and some rugged elevated countryside. It is one of Ireland's most important archaeological sites. Humans have lived near Lough Gur since about 3000 BC and there are numerous megalithic remains there.Grange stone circle (the largest stone circle in Ireland) and a dolmen are located near the lake. The remains of at least three crannogs are present, and remains of Stone Age houses have been unearthed (the house outlines are known as \"The Spectacles\"). A number of ring forts are found in the area, with one hill fort overlooking the lake. Some are Irish national monuments.It is here that the 14th-century lord of Munster and poet Gear\u00f3id Iarla, votary of the Goddess \u00c1ine, is said to sleep in a cave and emerge at time of Ireland's need to gallop around the lake on his great silver-shod white horse.A visitors' centre is open beside Lough Gur, along with a car park and picnic area. A gradual shore-line is present at the visitor area, with a shallow section of lake reaching up to the maintained lawn. As a result, the area is often used for water sports, though motorised craft are banned on the lake.There is a castle, or tower house (closed to visitors) near the entrance to the carpark. Named Bourchier's Castle after Sir George Bourchier, the son of the second Earl of Bath, it lies at the neck of the peninsula around which the lake washes. There is some other architecture dating from more recent times, with the ruins of an early Christian church by the road leading down to the lake. At the far end of the lake are the ruins of a Norman castle, Black Castle, which is reached by a hill-side walk along the east side of the lake. This is one of the keeps used during the Desmond Rebellions, and is probably the place where the Earl of Desmond secured his authority in 1573 after casting off his English apparel and donning Irish garments on his return to Munster from London.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEarly history of Ireland\nList of loughs in Ireland\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Lough Gur at Wikimedia Commons\n\nLough Gur - official visitor centre site at Shannon Heritage\nLough Gur Neolithic Settlement and Stone Age Centre\nLough Gur Development site.\nGoogle Earth Community KMZ file indicating the location of several important Lough Gur sites.",

        "wiki": "Limerick (; Irish: Luimneach [\u02c8l\u032a\u02e0\u026am\u02b2(\u0259)n\u02b2\u0259x]) is a city in County Limerick, Ireland. It is located in the Mid-West Region and is also part of the province of Munster. With a population of 94,192 at the 2016 census, Limerick is the third-most populous urban area in the state, and the fourth-most populous city on the island of Ireland. The city lies on the River Shannon, with the historic core of the city located on King's Island, which is bounded by the Shannon and Abbey Rivers. Limerick is also located at the head of the Shannon Estuary, where the river widens before it flows into the Atlantic Ocean. Limerick City and County Council is the local authority for the city.\n\n\n== Geography and political subdivisions ==\nAt the 2016 census, the Metropolitan District of Limerick had a population of 104,952. On 1 June 2014 following the merger of Limerick City and County Council, a new Metropolitan District of Limerick was formed within the united council, which extended the city area. The Metropolitan District includes the city urban area and extends outwards towards Patrickswell in the west and Castleconnell in the east. The City Metropolitan Area however excludes city suburbs located within County Clare.\nLimerick is one of the constituent cities of the Cork\u2013Limerick\u2013Galway corridor, which has a population of 1 million people. It is located at a strategic position on the River Shannon with four main crossing points near the city centre. To the south of the city is the Golden Vale, an area of rich pastureland. Historically, much of the city's industry was based on this rich agricultural hinterland, and it is particularly noted for Limerick ham.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient and medieval history ===\nLuimneach originally referred to the general area along the banks of the Shannon Estuary known as Loch Luimnigh. The earliest settlement in the city, Inis Sibhtonn, was the original name for King's Island during the pre-Viking and Viking eras. This island was also called Inis an Ghaill Duibh, 'The Dark-(haired) Foreigner's Island'. The name is recorded in Viking sources as Hlymrekr.\nThe city dates from 812; however, history suggests the presence of earlier settlements in the area surrounding King's Island, the island at the historical city centre. Antiquity's map-maker, Ptolemy, produced in 150 the earliest map of Ireland, showing a place called Regia at the same site as King's Island. History also records an important battle involving Cormac mac Airt in 221 and a visit by Saint Patrick in 434 to baptise an E\u00f3ganachta king, Carthann the Fair. Saint Munchin, the first bishop of Limerick died in 652, indicating the city was a place of some note. In 812 the Vikings sailed up the Shannon and pillaged the city, burned the monastery of Mungret but were forced to flee when the Irish attacked and killed many of their number. The Normans redesigned the city in the 12th century and added much of the most notable architecture, such as King John's Castle and St Mary's Cathedral.In early medieval times Limerick was at the centre of the Kingdom of Thomond which corresponds to the present day County Clare, the Kingdom also included North Kerry and parts of South Offaly. One of the kingdom's most notable kings was Brian Boru, ancestor of the O'Brien Clan of Dalcassians. The word Thomond is synonymous with the region and is retained in place names such as Thomondgate, Thomond Bridge and Thomond Park.\n\n\n=== Late Renaissance/Early modern history ===\n\nLimerick in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was often called the most beautiful city in Ireland. The English-born judge Luke Gernon, a resident of Limerick, wrote in 1620 that at his first sight of the city he had been amazed at its magnificence: \"lofty buildings of marble, like the Colleges in Oxford\".During the civil wars of the 17th century the city played a pivotal role, besieged by Oliver Cromwell in 1651 and twice by the Williamites in the 1690s. The Treaty of Limerick ended the Williamite war in Ireland which was fought between supporters of the Catholic King James II (Jacobites) and the Protestant King William of Orange (Williamites). The treaty offered toleration to Catholicism and full legal rights to Catholics that swore an oath of loyalty to William III and Mary II. The Treaty was of national significance as it ensured closer British and Protestant dominance over Ireland. The articles of the Treaty protecting Catholic rights were not passed by the Protestant Irish Parliament which rather updated the Penal Laws against Catholics which had major implications for Irish history. Reputedly the Treaty was signed on the Treaty Stone, an irregular block of limestone which once served as a mounting block for horses. This stone is now displayed on a pedestal at Clancy Strand. Because of the treaty, Limerick is sometimes known as the Treaty City. This turbulent period earned the city its motto: urbs antiqua fuit studisque asperrima belli (an ancient city well studied in the arts of war).\nThe peaceful times that followed the turmoil of the late 17th century allowed the city to prosper through trade in the late 18th century. During this time Limerick Port established itself as one of Ireland's major commercial ports exporting agricultural produce from one of Ireland's most fertile areas, the Golden Vale, to Britain and America. This increase in trade and wealth, particularly amongst the city's merchant classes saw a rapid expansion of the city as Georgian Limerick began to take shape. This gave the city its present-day look including the extensive terraced streets of Georgian townhouses which remain in the city centre today. The Waterford and Limerick Railway linked the city to the Dublin\u2013Cork railway line in 1848 and to Waterford in 1853. The opening of a number of secondary railways in the subsequent decades developed Limerick as a regional centre of communications.  However, the economic downturn in the European conflicts of the French Revolution and Napoleonic eras, and following the Act of Union 1800, and the impact of the Great Irish Famine of 1848 caused much of the 19th century to be a more troubled period.\n\n\n=== 20th-century history ===\n\nThe Limerick boycott was an economic boycott waged against the small Jewish community for over two years in the first decade of the 20th century. It was accompanied by a number of assaults, stone throwing and intimidation, which caused many Jews to leave the city. It was instigated in 1904 by a Redemptorist priest, Father John Creagh.\nDuring the Irish War of Independence, the Limerick Soviet was a self-declared soviet that existed from 15 to 27 April 1919. A general strike was organised by the Limerick Trades and Labour Council, as a protest against the British Army's declaration of a \"Special Military Area\" under the Defence of the Realm Act, which covered most of Limerick city and a part of the county. During the strike a special strike committee was set up to print their own money, control food prices and publish newspapers.\nBy the mid-20th century, Limerick was characterised by economic stagnation and decline as many traditional industries closed or left the city. However, there were some success stories. In 1942 Shannon Airport (located in County Clare, 20 km west of the city) opened for the first time offering transatlantic flights. In 1959, Shannon Airport enabled the opening of the Shannon Free Zone which attracted a large number of multinational companies to the region. A long campaign for a third level educational institute to be located in the city finally bore fruit with the establishment of NIHE Limerick in 1969 which eventually became the University of Limerick in 1989.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nThe local government area of Limerick city is under the jurisdiction of Limerick City and County Council. The Council has responsibility for local services such as sanitation, planning and development, libraries, collection of motor taxation, local roads and social housing in the city. The council comprises elected ward Councillors with an appointed full-time CEO as the city (and county) manager. Local elections are held every five years and the Councillors annually elect a Cathaoirleach or chairman to chair the council. As of 2015, the Cathaoirleach was Cllr Liam Galvin from the Newcastle West electoral area. The 21 Councillors from the 3 electoral districts in the City Metropolitan Area also elect a mayor to represent the city. The Mayoral position is largely ceremonial and has much reduced responsibility following the merger of the Limerick local authorities. Although the Mayor is the city's first citizen, within the council the position is below that of the Cathaoirleach. The current mayor is Councillor Jerry O'Dea. Former well-known mayors include TDs Donogh O'Malley, Stephen Coughlan, Michael Lipper, Jim Kemmy and Jan O'Sullivan.Throughout most of the city's history; from 1197 when it gained its first charter, Limerick City had its own local government authority, Limerick Corporation later known as Limerick City Council. The council was one of the oldest in Ireland and was only exceeded in age by Dublin City Council. In October 2012 the Government of Ireland published Putting People First- Action Programme for Effective Local Government which set out Government policy for reforms across all the main areas of local government in Ireland. Among the recommendations was the merging of Limerick City Council with Limerick County Council. The changes came into effect on 1 June 2014 following the implementation of the Local Government Reform Act 2014.By the 1960s onwards the city had outgrown its boundary considerably; the city boundary was only altered slightly and never reflected the overall urban area of the city. A limited boundary extension on the city's north side in 2008 enlarged the city boundary by 1,020 hectares increasing the city's area by almost 50% and raising the population by an estimated 7,000. The previous boundary, encompassing 2,086 hectares, was delineated in 1950. Newer suburban districts such as Dooradoyle, Castletroy \u2013 including the University, Gouldavoher, and Raheen were continually administered to by Limerick County Council until the merger of the two authorities in June 2014. This local government structure in Limerick caused a number of inefficiencies, most notably in the area of planning. A number of suburbs such as Westbury and Parteen to the north of the city are governed by Clare County Council.\nFollowing the merger of the two authorities in 2014 a new Metropolitan District of Limerick City was set up that included the city urban area and also settlements close to the city such as Patrickswell and Castleconnell. The Metropolitan district returns 21 Councillors to Limerick City and County Council which in total has 40 Councillors returned from across Limerick City and County. The Limerick City Metropolitan District is divided into 3 wards or electoral areas which are; Limerick City East, Limerick City North and Limerick City South which elect eight, six and seven Councillors respectively.Following the 2019 local elections, Fine Gael was the largest party on the united authority with 13 seats followed by Fianna F\u00e1il with 12, Labour with 3, Sinn F\u00e9in and the Green Party (Ireland) with 2 each, the Social Democrats with 1 seat, and Independents and other parties the remaining 6 seats.For national D\u00e1il elections Limerick City is in the Limerick City constituency. From 2011, the constituency boundaries changed in accordance with the proposals of the Constituency Commission and the subsequent Electoral (Amendment) Act 2009. This changed the electoral boundaries from Limerick East and Limerick West to Limerick City and Limerick. Limerick city encompasses the city, the suburban areas of Castletroy and as far east as Castleconnell. It also includes part of south County Clare. The Limerick county constituency takes in most of the rest of the county. For European parliament elections Limerick is in South Ireland.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nLimerick's climate is classified as temperate oceanic (K\u00f6ppen Cfb). Met \u00c9ireann maintains a climatological weather station at Shannon Airport, 20 kilometres west of the city in County Clare. Shannon Airport records an average of 977 millimetres of precipitation annually, most of which is rain. Limerick has a mild climate, with the average daily maximum in July of 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) and the average daily minimum in January of 3 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F). The highest temperature recorded was 32.0 \u00b0C (89.6 \u00b0F) in June 2018, and the lowest \u221211.4 \u00b0C (11.5 \u00b0F) in 2010. Limerick is the cloudiest city in the state, averaging only 1,295 sunshine hours annually, 3.5 hours of sunshine every day. There are on average 62 days of no recordable sunshine, 6 days of thunder, 22 days of hail and 11 days of snow per year. Shannon Airport is located by the ocean at an elevation of 14 metres, so snow is less common at the station than in the city itself.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn 2014, Limerick became Ireland's inaugural National City of Culture, with a variety of artistic and cultural events occurring at locations around the city throughout the year.\nThe Limerick City Gallery of Art on Pery Square is the city's chief venue for contemporary art exhibitions. It is home to a permanent collection of Irish art, which shows works from the early 18th to 20th century. The gallery houses the National Collection of Contemporary Drawing founded by the artist Samuel Walsh in 1987. Limerick's major contemporary art event is EVA International, Ireland's Biennial of Contemporary Art. EVA International, centered mainly in the Limerick City Gallery of Art, is curated by varying guest curators and includes contemporary artworks by both international and Irish artists.The Lime Tree Theatre officially opened at the Mary Immaculate College campus in October 2012. The venue hosts theatre, music, comedy, traditional arts, schools' performances and conferences.The Belltable Arts Centre on O'Connell Street hosts local playwrights and drama productions. The University Concert Hall located in UL is a 1,000 seat venue and provides a large venue for national and international acts to visit the city. Limerick is also the home of street theatre companies, including \"The Umbrella Project\".\nLimerick's literature scene is supported by projects like the Limerick Writers' Centre, which was established in 2008 and runs a range of writing activities in the city. Limerick natives include Pulitzer Prize winning author, Frank McCourt; novelists Kate O'Brien, Michael Curtin, Kevin Barry and Donal Ryan. Poets from Limerick include Michael Hogan, Desmond O'Grady, and John Liddy.Other Limerick arts groups include Contact Studios, which provides individual studio spaces for visual artists; the Daghdha Dance Company, a contemporary dance company that has adopted a renovated church in John's Square, adjacent to St John's Cathedral, as a performance space); the Fresh Film Festival, which is held each spring, and includes films made by young people (7\u201318 years); Impact Theatre Company; and Limerick Printmakers Studio and Gallery, which provides printmaking facilities, a venue for exhibitions and events and an education programme. The Limerick Youth Theatre provides young people with an opening into acting and production.The Irish Chamber Orchestra and the Irish World Music Centre are both based in the University of Limerick. The university has a thousand-seat state-of-the-art concert hall that hosts visiting performers. The city's music scene has produced bands such as The Cranberries, guitarist Noel Hogan's MonoBand, The Hitchers and others. Electronic musician Richard D. James, more commonly known as Aphex Twin, was born in Limerick in 1971. The Limerick Art Gallery and the Art College cater for painting, sculpture and performance art.\nLimerick is also home to comedians The Rubberbandits, D'Unbelievables (Pat Shortt and Jon Kenny) and Karl Spain. Dolan's Warehouse on the Dock Road is a venue specialising in live music, established in 1998. Baker Place was a nightclub that held mainly local underground nights until its closure in 2011. In 2020, it was announced that the Dromkeen-based Shiloh Trust was seeking planning permission to convert the former premises of Baker Place into a bible school. The Crush 87 nightclub (formerly known as Trinity Rooms until its closure in 2010), was relaunched in 2013.The city is the setting for Frank McCourt's memoir Angela's Ashes and the film adaptation. The Frank McCourt Museum situated in Frank's former school on Hartsonge Street opened in 2011 and contains artefacts from the book. Limerick has also been the setting or location for a number of other films, including the dramas The Real Thing (2002), Cowboys & Angels (2003) and Lost & Found (2015).Riverfest is a summer festival held annually in Limerick since 2004. The 2014 festival was held in May and had a record 80,000 visitors.\n\n\n== Humorous verse ==\nA limerick is a type of humorous verse of five lines with an AABBA rhyme scheme: the poem's connection with the city is obscure, but the name is generally taken to be a reference to Limerick city or County Limerick, sometimes particularly to the Maigue Poets, and may derive from an earlier form of nonsense verse parlour game that traditionally included a refrain that included \"Will [or won't] you come (up) to Limerick?\" The earliest known use of the name \"Limerick\" for this type poem is an 1880 reference, in a Saint John, New Brunswick newspaper, to an apparently well-known tune.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Broadcasting ===\nRT\u00c9 lyric fm, a state-run classical music radio station and part of RT\u00c9, broadcasts nationally from studios in the city centre on Cornmarket Square which opened in 1994. Limerick's local radio station is Live 95FM, broadcasting from 'Radio House', near the waterfront at Steamboat Quay. Spin South West, owned by Communicorp, broadcasts to Counties Kerry, Clare, Limerick, Tipperary and southwest Laois from its studios at Landmark Buildings in the Raheen Industrial Estate. Student radio station, Wired FM, broadcasts on 99.9FM from Mary Immaculate College. Wired FM also has studios in Limerick Institute of Technology. University Hospital Limerick has a radio station on 94.2FM, but this can be heard only in the hospital and surrounding area. West Limerick 102 is broadcast from Newcastle West. The national broadcaster, RT\u00c9, has radio and television studios in the city, which are periodically used to broadcast programming from Limerick.\n\n\n=== Print ===\nSeveral local newspapers are published in the city, including The Limerick Post and The Limerick Leader and magazines include the Limerick Event Guide, Business Limerick and Limerick Now.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\nLimerick city is approximately 25 km from Shannon Airport. Tourist attractions in the city centre include Limerick City Museum, King John's Castle (1210), St Mary's Cathedral (1168), the Hunt Museum, the University of Limerick, Georgian houses and gardens and the Treaty Stone.  There are several seasonal tours, including Angela's Ashes walking tour of Limerick City, historical walking tour, and boat tours along the River Shannon.\nThe city centre is divided between the traditional areas of \"English Town\" on the southern end of King's Island, which includes the King John's Castle; \"Irish Town\", which includes the older streets on the south bank; and the current economic centre further south, called \"Newtown Pery\". Newtown Pery was built in the late 18th century before the Act of Union and, unusually for an Irish city and unique in Limerick, is laid out on a grid plan. The Limerick City Museum (formerly aka the Jim Kemmy Municipal Museum), is located in Istabraq Hall, City Hall, Merchant's Quay. It contains displays on Limerick's history and manufactures.\n\nThe Georgian core of the city, with its Georgian architecture in the Newtown Pery, was developed from the mid 18th century. This core includes O'Connell Street (George Street before independence) from the Cecil Street intersection running to the south west end of the Crescent, and south-east to Pery Street including Glentworth Street and Barrington Street. Other buildings of architectural note in the city are St John's Cathedral, designed by the notable Victorian architect, Philip Charles Hardwick. St Mary's Cathedral, at over 800 years old, is one of the oldest in Ireland. St John's Cathedral, whilst more modern, has Ireland's tallest spire at 94 m (308 ft).\nThe Hunt Museum is based in the historic 18th-century former Custom House. The museum was established to house a collection of approximately 2000 works of art and antiquities formed by John and Gertrude Hunt during their lifetimes.\nThe main park in Limerick is the People's Park which was opened in 1877 in memory of Richard Russell, a prominent local business man. The park is dominated by the Thomas Spring Rice memorial (MP for the city 1820\u20131832) and has a large collection of mature deciduous and evergreen trees.\nLimerick city centre changed significantly with the construction of several modern high-rise buildings in the early 2000s, in particular as part of the regeneration of the former docks area along the Dock Road. The suburban areas, where the majority of the population now live, have grown out from the centre along the main roads to Ennis (North Circular and Ennis Road areas/Caherdavin), Dublin (Castletroy and the University) and Cork (Ballinacurra/Dooradoyle/Raheen). Suburban houses are generally two-floor semi-detached homes for single families. These were built from the 1950s onwards in large estates by government projects and commercial developments, although there are many examples of Edwardian and older 1930s suburban homes on the main suburban thoroughfares leading towards the city (North & South Circular, Ballinacurra Road, O'Connell Avenue).\n\nLimerick city's nightlife is supported by a number of nightclubs and pubs which offer music. For example, Dolan's Warehouse is a small music venue which hosts local, national and international folk, indie, jazz, rock and traditional Irish music acts.In County Limerick, Adare village and the Foynes Flying Boat Museum, approximately 35 km (22 miles/30 minutes) from Limerick City along the scenic coastal N69 route from Limerick to Tralee, are also attractions. Bunratty Castle in County Clare is another local attraction, and is situated 15.4 km north of the city. Limerick is known to be the antipodes to the Campbell Islands of New Zealand.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nLimerick is the third largest city in Ireland (after Dublin and Cork) with a population of 94,192 in the urban area and 104,952 in the metropolitan district, according to the 2016 CSO census. The past census reported a large population decline in central city areas due in part to the Limerick regeneration process where in these areas the largest reduction was reported nationally and also to outward migration following the collapse of the local and national economy from 2008 onwards. The population of the Limerick Larger Urban Zone as defined by the EU is 162,413. The ethnic diversity in Limerick's population, which includes a large immigrant community, saw rapid growth during the Celtic Tiger and the following decade. The Polish community is one of the largest demographic groups in the Municipal District, with approximately 4,000 living and working in the area. Ireland's first Polish bank opened in 2007. The African community has set up a number of churches, which are now part of the cultural makeup of the city.Limerick has a large stock of local authority housing. Prior to the merger of Limerick City and County Council 41% of all housing within the old Limerick City Council boundary was local authority, which was the highest in Ireland. This figure is however no longer accurate given the larger metropolitan district of the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nLimerick is in the region dubbed \"the Midwest\". Also known as the \"Shannon Region\", this is primarily an economic and social concept. The region encompasses County Limerick, County Clare, North County Tipperary, Northwest County Kerry and south County Offaly, with its focal point centred on Limerick and its environs within an 8-kilometre (5 mi) radius.\nThe area is the main economic region in Ireland outside Dublin and Cork. Its economic development has been driven in part by the University of Limerick, Limerick Institute of Technology, Shannon Airport in County Clare and Shannon Development (an economic development agency), whose precursor was SFADCO (Shannon Free Airport Development Company), an economic agency that provided tax incentives to companies locating in the area surrounding Shannon Airport. As of 2006 Shannon Development was mostly concerned with disposing of valuable industrial park properties. Limerick Chamber of Commerce, a representative body for businesses in the region, celebrated its bicentennial/bicentenary in 2015.\nHistorically Limerick was an agricultural commodity-driven economy, due to its position as the first major port along the River Shannon. By the middle of the 18th century, Limerick Port grew to become one of Ireland's principal commercial ports, exporting agricultural produce from the most fertile tracts in Ireland known as the Golden Vale as well as produce from the surrounding counties. The city was one of the main meat processing areas in Ireland, and industry included confectionery and flour production. The city was known for its bacon industry \u2013 however this went into decline in the mid-20th century. The fishing industry in Limerick, based on Clancy's Strand opposite King John's Castle and at Coonagh nearby, once employed hundreds of men. The boat most commonly used was the Gandelow which was also used as a small Lighter (barge) to ferry goods to and from larger ships in the port. In the 1920s the construction of a dam at Ardnacrusha severely impacted salmon breeding and that, and the introduction of quotas, had by the 1950s caused salmon fishing to diminish. By 2006, most fishermen had relinquished their drift net licences and the industry can now be said to be dormant.As with other cities in Ireland, a number of multinational companies are based in Limerick, and the city is a growing recipient of foreign direct investment. Dell had its main European Manufacturing Facility at the Raheen Business Park however in January 2009 Dell announced that it would close its Limerick computer manufacturing plant and move the production lines to Poland. The facility was the largest Dell manufacturing plant outside the United States and produced 30,000\u201360,000 units per day for export to the EMEA. Dell remains one of the largest employers in the mid-west with over 1,000 people employed in service and support. Analog Devices has its European manufacturing base in Raheen, 3 km south-west of the city centre. The site employs more than 1,000 people. Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Vistakon (the world's largest manufacturer of contact lenses) has a large facility in Castletroy in the National Technology Park and also employs close to 1,000 people. It is Vistakon's only production facility outside the United States and one of the largest contact-lens manufacturing plants in the world. Cook Medical, the world's largest privately owned Medical Devices company, employs over 800 people in Limerick at the National Technology Park.\nThe Post-2008 Irish economic downturn had a profound effect on Limerick. The announcement in 2009 that Dell was to move its manufacturing facility from Limerick to Poland devastated the local economy. 1,900 jobs were lost at Dell and it is believed that for every job that was lost at Dell at least another 4 to 5 were at risk. The closure of the Dell manufacturing facility amounted to 2% of Ireland's national GDP. The downturn in the construction industry also cost many jobs as did the stalled Limerick regeneration programme which promised investment in Limerick's deprived city areas. As of 2012 unemployment had become a major problem across the city with the unemployment rate in the city at 28.6% which was almost twice the national average.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nThe Crescent Shopping Centre is the largest shopping centre in Ireland, outside of Dublin, and the largest in the province of Munster. It is located in Dooradoyle about 3 km south of the city centre, and has over 90 shopping outlets along with restaurants and a 12-screen Omniplex Cinema. The city centre also has a large retail district which includes a mix of more traditional type of shops as well as some modern high street stores. Cruises Street is one of the main shopping streets. O'Connell Street, William Street, Bedford Row and Thomas Street) are also retail streets within the city. The city centre saw some works on remodelling in the early 21st century, with pedestrianisation works on Bedford Row, Thomas Street and parts of Catherine Street, as well as widening footpaths on William Street. These works have sought to address a reduction of footfall in the city centre (in turn influencing the closure of many city centre retail businesses) which occurred from the recession of 2008 onwards.\n\n\n==== Retail parks and shopping centres ====\n\nDuring the Celtic Tiger years a number of shopping centres and retail parks opened in suburban areas of Limerick. In addition to the Crescent Shopping Centre, which expanded in the early 2000s, the Jetland Shopping Centre opened in Caherdavin in 2005. The Childers Road Retail Park and the Parkway Shopping Centre in the east of the city also have a number of high street stores. Unfinished retail centres include the Coonagh Cross retail development and the Parkway Valley Shopping Centre on the Dublin Road. A proposed but unapproved retail development project, the Opera Centre, makes up part of the \"Limerick 2030\" scheme.\n\n\n==== The Milk Market ====\nThe Milk Market located at Cornmarket Row in the city centre sells locally produced foods and products and is governed by Limerick Market Trustees. In 2010 work was undertaken to redevelop the existing premises to an all-weather, all year round facility as it operated in an outdoor environment. The work involved constructing a large canopy over the existing market premises and was officially re-opened in June 2010. The Milk Market Project won the 2011 Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI) 'Peoples Choice Award'.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nIn 2013, a renewable energy strategy was launched for the region, and proposed a 20% reduction in CO2-emissions, while ensuring that short-term actions were beneficial to the long-term goal of 100% renewable energy. The strategy was completed by the Danish Aalborg University.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\nShannon Airport is 20 km west of the city in County Clare. It is one of Ireland's main airports and is easily accessible from Limerick via the N18 dual carriageway and from other regions via the Limerick Tunnel. It has scheduled flights to European and North American destinations. Airlines using the airport include Ryanair, Aer Lingus, United Airlines, American Airlines, Aer Lingus Regional and Delta Air Lines. There is no rail link to the airport. Coonagh airfield, a few kilometres west of Caherdavin, serves small private aircraft. Kerry and Cork Airports are around 1 hour 30 minutes and 2 hours drive away, respectively. Kerry Airport is connected to Farranfore railway station, from Limerick railway station travel via Limerick Junction and Mallow.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nLocal public transport is provided by several companies. Bus \u00c9ireann, Ireland's state-owned bus company, operates a number of services subsidised by the National Transport Authority, while a number of provide operators also run commercial bus services in and around Limerick. An updated city bus network was introduced in Limerick City in December 2016, which introduced new routes. In May 2019, Bus \u00c9ireann further changed and improved the Limerick City timetable, including increased frequency and later operating times.\nOther rural buses run to towns and villages in the county and to Shannon Airport. There are also a number of Intercity and international buses from Bus \u00c9ireann's bus terminal adjoining Limerick Colbert railway station. These include hourly services to Dublin, Cork, Ennis and Galway. Bus \u00c9ireann have also commenced a Limerick to Galway Express service travelling on the M18 in addition to the regular service. Buses run every 2 hours to Tralee and Killarney. There are also regular daily services to Waterford and Athlone, and a daily service to London via the ferry from Rosslare Europort.\nThere are a number of private bus companies in operation providing city and intercity services. Dublin Coach provide the M7 express service which operates every hour from Arthur's Quay which goes to Dublin or Ennis. JJ Kavanagh also provide Dublin to Limerick services from Arthur's Quay. Citylink run a number of services from Limerick to Galway and Cork and operate from Henry Street.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nIarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann's Limerick Colbert station is the railway hub for the city and the Mid West Region with a number of intercity and commuter rail services. Limerick railway station opened on 28 August 1858, replacing an earlier, temporary station 500 m east, which had operated from 9 May 1848.The following inter city routes are available from Limerick Colbert station :\n\nLimerick to Dublin Heuston: 16 services daily including 4 direct services. All remaining Dublin \u2013 Limerick services require passengers to change to the Dublin to Cork train at either Limerick Junction or at Ballybrophy railway station.\nLimerick to Waterford: 2 services daily (but none on Sundays). Passengers must change train at Limerick Junction to continue to Waterford with stations at Tipperary, Cahir, Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir.\nLimerick to Galway: 5 services daily. This service reopened on 29 March 2010.\nLimerick to Cork: Passengers can travel between Limerick and Cork via Limerick Junction. There is no direct service.\nLimerick to Killarney, Farranfore and Tralee: Passengers can travel between Limerick and Killarney, Farranfore and Tralee via Limerick Junction where trains run via Mallow to reach County Kerry.There are 3 suburban/commuter services in the Limerick Suburban Rail network:\n\nLimerick \u2013 Ennis calling at Sixmilebridge\nLimerick \u2013 Nenagh calling at Castleconnell and Birdhill (with some services continuing to Cloughjordan & Roscrea & connecting to the Dublin-Cork railway line at Ballybrophy.) Due to speed restrictions this alternative Dublin \u2013 Limerick route can take 60 minutes longer (with a change at Ballybrophy) than by Limerick Junction albeit a more direct service.\nLimerick \u2013 Limerick Junction and ThurlesThere are also a number of disused railway lines including the Limerick to Foynes line which closed to freight in the early 2000s, having lost passenger services in the early 1960s, although the track is still in situ.  This is the last remaining part of the North Kerry Line which closed to passenger traffic in the early 1960s and to freight traffic (other than Limerick \u2013 Foynes) in the mid-1970s, and has been lifted between Ballingrane (near Rathkeale) and Tralee.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nLimerick's central location in the mid\u2013west of Ireland means many national primary routes converge on the city. The M7 (Dublin), N/M18 (Galway, Ennis, Shannon), N/M20 (Cork), N21 (Tralee) and N24 (Waterford) routes all start/terminate in or near the city. Road infrastructure is further supplemented by the southern ring road and Limerick Tunnel bypass of the city and the M20 bypass of Dooradoyle and Raheen to the south of the city. Connections to the other cities were improved with the completion of the M7 motorway in December 2010, and continuing upgrades ongoing to the N/M18 to Shannon, Ennis, Galway and Tuam \u2013 the final section opened in September 2017. A motorway is also planned between Cork and Limerick, with a proposed completion date in the mid 2020s.\n\n\n=== Waterway transport ===\nHistorically, waterway transport has been key to Limerick's development. Vikings established the city as a maritime trading port. The city's position on a major Irish river system, the Shannon, enabled transport to the midlands of Ireland and further north and west. By the 18th century with the opening of canal systems throughout Ireland, Limerick Port established itself as Ireland's premier commercial port on the western side of the country. This was enabled by ease of access from the facilitated by the opening of canals but most importantly to the River Shannon. The opening of the Grand Canal in the 18th century provided further access to Dublin and the east of the country. There are also a number of disused canals in the vicinity of the city including the Park Canal & the Passey \u2013 Errina Canal on the old Limerick navigation. Waterway transport on the Shannon was regularly used to transport goods from Limerick to Dublin and vice versa however this mode of transport fell into decline in the 20th century. Originally Limerick port was located near the confluence of the Abbey and Shannon rivers at King's Island. Today the Shannon Foynes Port is located further downstream on the Shannon alongside the Dock Road. This general purpose facility port is operated by the Shannon Foynes Port Company who operate all marine activities in the Shannon estuary.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nLimerick is a centre of higher education in the region, and technical and continuation education within the city traces its beginning back to the formation of the Limerick Athenaeum Society in 1852, marking the foundation of the Limerick Institute of Technology.

Limerick was designated as a European City of Sport for 2011 by the European Capitals of Sport Association (ACES).\nThe National Elite Swimming Club is based in The University of Limerick Arena.\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\nSimilar to the rest of Ireland, basketball was a popular sport in Limerick during the 1970s and 1980s, with up to four divisions in the men's and women's local leagues. It suffered a decline during the 1990s culminating in the complete demise of local league basketball in the city and surrounding areas. The main clubs in the city were St. Colm's and Marathon with St. Colm's in particular having a long history in the National Leagues. Limerick is currently represented in the National Leagues by the men's UL Eagles team and the women's UL Aughinish team.

It is located in the Mid-West Region and is also part of the province of Munster. With a population of 94,192 at the 2016 census, Limerick is the third-most populous urban area in the state, and the fourth-most populous city on the island of Ireland. The city lies on the River Shannon, with the historic core of the city located on King's Island, which is bounded by the Shannon and Abbey Rivers. Limerick is also located at the head of the Shannon Estuary, where the river widens before it flows into the Atlantic Ocean. Limerick City and County Council is the local authority for the city.\n\n\n== Geography and political subdivisions ==\nAt the 2016 census, the Metropolitan District of Limerick had a population of 104,952. On 1 June 2014 following the merger of Limerick City and County Council, a new Metropolitan District of Limerick was formed within the united council, which extended the city area. The Metropolitan District includes the city urban area and extends outwards towards Patrickswell in the west and Castleconnell in the east. The City Metropolitan Area however excludes city suburbs located within County Clare.\nLimerick is one of the constituent cities of the Cork\u2013Limerick\u2013Galway corridor, which has a population of 1 million people. It is located at a strategic position on the River Shannon with four main crossing points near the city centre. To the south of the city is the Golden Vale, an area of rich pastureland. Historically, much of the city's industry was based on this rich agricultural hinterland, and it is particularly noted for Limerick ham.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient and medieval history ===\nLuimneach originally referred to the general area along the banks of the Shannon Estuary known as Loch Luimnigh. The earliest settlement in the city, Inis Sibhtonn, was the original name for King's Island during the pre-Viking and Viking eras. This island was also called Inis an Ghaill Duibh, 'The Dark-(haired) Foreigner's Island'. The name is recorded in Viking sources as Hlymrekr.\nThe city dates from 812; however, history suggests the presence of earlier settlements in the area surrounding King's Island, the island at the historical city centre. Antiquity's map-maker, Ptolemy, produced in 150 the earliest map of Ireland, showing a place called Regia at the same site as King's Island. History also records an important battle involving Cormac mac Airt in 221 and a visit by Saint Patrick in 434 to baptise an E\u00f3ganachta king, Carthann the Fair. Saint Munchin, the first bishop of Limerick died in 652, indicating the city was a place of some note. In 812 the Vikings sailed up the Shannon and pillaged the city, burned the monastery of Mungret but were forced to flee when the Irish attacked and killed many of their number. The Normans redesigned the city in the 12th century and added much of the most notable architecture, such as King John's Castle and St Mary's Cathedral.In early medieval times Limerick was at the centre of the Kingdom of Thomond which corresponds to the present day County Clare, the Kingdom also included North Kerry and parts of South Offaly. One of the kingdom's most notable kings was Brian Boru, ancestor of the O'Brien Clan of Dalcassians. The word Thomond is synonymous with the region and is retained in place names such as Thomondgate, Thomond Bridge and Thomond Park.\n\n\n=== Late Renaissance/Early modern history ===\n\nLimerick in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was often called the most beautiful city in Ireland. The English-born judge Luke Gernon, a resident of Limerick, wrote in 1620 that at his first sight of the city he had been amazed at its magnificence: \"lofty buildings of marble, like the Colleges in Oxford\".During the civil wars of the 17th century the city played a pivotal role, besieged by Oliver Cromwell in 1651 and twice by the Williamites in the 1690s. The Treaty of Limerick ended the Williamite war in Ireland which was fought between supporters of the Catholic King James II (Jacobites) and the Protestant King William of Orange (Williamites). The treaty offered toleration to Catholicism and full legal rights to Catholics that swore an oath of loyalty to William III and Mary II. The Treaty was of national significance as it ensured closer British and Protestant dominance over Ireland. The articles of the Treaty protecting Catholic rights were not passed by the Protestant Irish Parliament which rather updated the Penal Laws against Catholics which had major implications for Irish history. Reputedly the Treaty was signed on the Treaty Stone, an irregular block of limestone which once served as a mounting block for horses. This stone is now displayed on a pedestal at Clancy Strand. Because of the treaty, Limerick is sometimes known as the Treaty City. This turbulent period earned the city its motto: urbs antiqua fuit studisque asperrima belli (an ancient city well studied in the arts of war).\nThe peaceful times that followed the turmoil of the late 17th century allowed the city to prosper through trade in the late 18th century. During this time Limerick Port established itself as one of Ireland's major commercial ports exporting agricultural produce from one of Ireland's most fertile areas, the Golden Vale, to Britain and America. This increase in trade and wealth, particularly amongst the city's merchant classes saw a rapid expansion of the city as Georgian Limerick began to take shape. This gave the city its present-day look including the extensive terraced streets of Georgian townhouses which remain in the city centre today. The Waterford and Limerick Railway linked the city to the Dublin\u2013Cork railway line in 1848 and to Waterford in 1853. The opening of a number of secondary railways in the subsequent decades developed Limerick as a regional centre of communications.  However, the economic downturn in the European conflicts of the French Revolution and Napoleonic eras, and following the Act of Union 1800, and the impact of the Great Irish Famine of 1848 caused much of the 19th century to be a more troubled period.\n\n\n=== 20th-century history ===\n\nThe Limerick boycott was an economic boycott waged against the small Jewish community for over two years in the first decade of the 20th century. It was accompanied by a number of assaults, stone throwing and intimidation, which caused many Jews to leave the city. It was instigated in 1904 by a Redemptorist priest, Father John Creagh.\nDuring the Irish War of Independence, the Limerick Soviet was a self-declared soviet that existed from 15 to 27 April 1919. A general strike was organised by the Limerick Trades and Labour Council, as a protest against the British Army's declaration of a \"Special Military Area\" under the Defence of the Realm Act, which covered most of Limerick city and a part of the county. During the strike a special strike committee was set up to print their own money, control food prices and publish newspapers.\nBy the mid-20th century, Limerick was characterised by economic stagnation and decline as many traditional industries closed or left the city. However, there were some success stories. In 1942 Shannon Airport (located in County Clare, 20 km west of the city) opened for the first time offering transatlantic flights. In 1959, Shannon Airport enabled the opening of the Shannon Free Zone which attracted a large number of multinational companies to the region. A long campaign for a third level educational institute to be located in the city finally bore fruit with the establishment of NIHE Limerick in 1969 which eventually became the University of Limerick in 1989.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nThe local government area of Limerick city is under the jurisdiction of Limerick City and County Council. The Council has responsibility for local services such as sanitation, planning and development, libraries, collection of motor taxation, local roads and social housing in the city. The council comprises elected ward Councillors with an appointed full-time CEO as the city (and county) manager. Local elections are held every five years and the Councillors annually elect a Cathaoirleach or chairman to chair the council. As of 2015, the Cathaoirleach was Cllr Liam Galvin from the Newcastle West electoral area. The 21 Councillors from the 3 electoral districts in the City Metropolitan Area also elect a mayor to represent the city. The Mayoral position is largely ceremonial and has much reduced responsibility following the merger of the Limerick local authorities. Although the Mayor is the city's first citizen, within the council the position is below that of the Cathaoirleach. The current mayor is Councillor Jerry O'Dea. Former well-known mayors include TDs Donogh O'Malley, Stephen Coughlan, Michael Lipper, Jim Kemmy and Jan O'Sullivan.Throughout most of the city's history; from 1197 when it gained its first charter, Limerick City had its own local government authority, Limerick Corporation later known as Limerick City Council. The council was one of the oldest in Ireland and was only exceeded in age by Dublin City Council. In October 2012 the Government of Ireland published Putting People First- Action Programme for Effective Local Government which set out Government policy for reforms across all the main areas of local government in Ireland. Among the recommendations was the merging of Limerick City Council with Limerick County Council. The changes came into effect on 1 June 2014 following the implementation of the Local Government Reform Act 2014.By the 1960s onwards the city had outgrown its boundary considerably; the city boundary was only altered slightly and never reflected the overall urban area of the city. A limited boundary extension on the city's north side in 2008 enlarged the city boundary by 1,020 hectares increasing the city's area by almost 50% and raising the population by an estimated 7,000. The previous boundary, encompassing 2,086 hectares, was delineated in 1950. Newer suburban districts such as Dooradoyle, Castletroy \u2013 including the University, Gouldavoher, and Raheen were continually administered to by Limerick County Council until the merger of the two authorities in June 2014. This local government structure in Limerick caused a number of inefficiencies, most notably in the area of planning. A number of suburbs such as Westbury and Parteen to the north of the city are governed by Clare County Council.\nFollowing the merger of the two authorities in 2014 a new Metropolitan District of Limerick City was set up that included the city urban area and also settlements close to the city such as Patrickswell and Castleconnell. The Metropolitan district returns 21 Councillors to Limerick City and County Council which in total has 40 Councillors returned from across Limerick City and County. The Limerick City Metropolitan District is divided into 3 wards or electoral areas which are; Limerick City East, Limerick City North and Limerick City South which elect eight, six and seven Councillors respectively.Following the 2019 local elections, Fine Gael was the largest party on the united authority with 13 seats followed by Fianna F\u00e1il with 12, Labour with 3, Sinn F\u00e9in and the Green Party (Ireland) with 2 each, the Social Democrats with 1 seat, and Independents and other parties the remaining 6 seats.For national D\u00e1il elections Limerick City is in the Limerick City constituency. From 2011, the constituency boundaries changed in accordance with the proposals of the Constituency Commission and the subsequent Electoral (Amendment) Act 2009. This changed the electoral boundaries from Limerick East and Limerick West to Limerick City and Limerick. Limerick city encompasses the city, the suburban areas of Castletroy and as far east as Castleconnell. It also includes part of south County Clare. The Limerick county constituency takes in most of the rest of the county. For European parliament elections Limerick is in South Ireland.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nLimerick's climate is classified as temperate oceanic (K\u00f6ppen Cfb). Met \u00c9ireann maintains a climatological weather station at Shannon Airport, 20 kilometres west of the city in County Clare. Shannon Airport records an average of 977 millimetres of precipitation annually, most of which is rain. Limerick has a mild climate, with the average daily maximum in July of 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) and the average daily minimum in January of 3 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F). The highest temperature recorded was 32.0 \u00b0C (89.6 \u00b0F) in June 2018, and the lowest \u221211.4 \u00b0C (11.5 \u00b0F) in 2010. Limerick is the cloudiest city in the state, averaging only 1,295 sunshine hours annually, 3.5 hours of sunshine every day. There are on average 62 days of no recordable sunshine, 6 days of thunder, 22 days of hail and 11 days of snow per year. Shannon Airport is located by the ocean at an elevation of 14 metres, so snow is less common at the station than in the city itself.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn 2014, Limerick became Ireland's inaugural National City of Culture, with a variety of artistic and cultural events occurring at locations around the city throughout the year.\nThe Limerick City Gallery of Art on Pery Square is the city's chief venue for contemporary art exhibitions. It is home to a permanent collection of Irish art, which shows works from the early 18th to 20th century. The gallery houses the National Collection of Contemporary Drawing founded by the artist Samuel Walsh in 1987. Limerick's major contemporary art event is EVA International, Ireland's Biennial of Contemporary Art. EVA International, centered mainly in the Limerick City Gallery of Art, is curated by varying guest curators and includes contemporary artworks by both international and Irish artists.The Lime Tree Theatre officially opened at the Mary Immaculate College campus in October 2012. The venue hosts theatre, music, comedy, traditional arts, schools' performances and conferences.The Belltable Arts Centre on O'Connell Street hosts local playwrights and drama productions. The University Concert Hall located in UL is a 1,000 seat venue and provides a large venue for national and international acts to visit the city. Limerick is also the home of street theatre companies, including \"The Umbrella Project\".\nLimerick's literature scene is supported by projects like the Limerick Writers' Centre, which was established in 2008 and runs a range of writing activities in the city. Limerick natives include Pulitzer Prize winning author, Frank McCourt; novelists Kate O'Brien, Michael Curtin, Kevin Barry and Donal Ryan. Poets from Limerick include Michael Hogan, Desmond O'Grady, and John Liddy.Other Limerick arts groups include Contact Studios, which provides individual studio spaces for visual artists; the Daghdha Dance Company, a contemporary dance company that has adopted a renovated church in John's Square, adjacent to St John's Cathedral, as a performance space); the Fresh Film Festival, which is held each spring, and includes films made by young people (7\u201318 years); Impact Theatre Company; and Limerick Printmakers Studio and Gallery, which provides printmaking facilities, a venue for exhibitions and events and an education programme. The Limerick Youth Theatre provides young people with an opening into acting and production.The Irish Chamber Orchestra and the Irish World Music Centre are both based in the University of Limerick. The university has a thousand-seat state-of-the-art concert hall that hosts visiting performers. The city's music scene has produced bands such as The Cranberries, guitarist Noel Hogan's MonoBand, The Hitchers and others. Electronic musician Richard D. James, more commonly known as Aphex Twin, was born in Limerick in 1971. The Limerick Art Gallery and the Art College cater for painting, sculpture and performance art.\nLimerick is also home to comedians The Rubberbandits, D'Unbelievables (Pat Shortt and Jon Kenny) and Karl Spain. Dolan's Warehouse on the Dock Road is a venue specialising in live music, established in 1998. Baker Place was a nightclub that held mainly local underground nights until its closure in 2011. In 2020, it was announced that the Dromkeen-based Shiloh Trust was seeking planning permission to convert the former premises of Baker Place into a bible school. The Crush 87 nightclub (formerly known as Trinity Rooms until its closure in 2010), was relaunched in 2013.The city is the setting for Frank McCourt's memoir Angela's Ashes and the film adaptation. The Frank McCourt Museum situated in Frank's former school on Hartsonge Street opened in 2011 and contains artefacts from the book. Limerick has also been the setting or location for a number of other films, including the dramas The Real Thing (2002), Cowboys & Angels (2003) and Lost & Found (2015).Riverfest is a summer festival held annually in Limerick since 2004. The 2014 festival was held in May and had a record 80,000 visitors.\n\n\n== Humorous verse ==\nA limerick is a type of humorous verse of five lines with an AABBA rhyme scheme: the poem's connection with the city is obscure, but the name is generally taken to be a reference to Limerick city or County Limerick, sometimes particularly to the Maigue Poets, and may derive from an earlier form of nonsense verse parlour game that traditionally included a refrain that included \"Will [or won't] you come (up) to Limerick?\" The earliest known use of the name \"Limerick\" for this type poem is an 1880 reference, in a Saint John, New Brunswick newspaper, to an apparently well-known tune.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Broadcasting ===\nRT\u00c9 lyric fm, a state-run classical music radio station and part of RT\u00c9, broadcasts nationally from studios in the city centre on Cornmarket Square which opened in 1994. Limerick's local radio station is Live 95FM, broadcasting from 'Radio House', near the waterfront at Steamboat Quay. Spin South West, owned by Communicorp, broadcasts to Counties Kerry, Clare, Limerick, Tipperary and southwest Laois from its studios at Landmark Buildings in the Raheen Industrial Estate. Student radio station, Wired FM, broadcasts on 99.9FM from Mary Immaculate College. Wired FM also has studios in Limerick Institute of Technology. University Hospital Limerick has a radio station on 94.2FM, but this can be heard only in the hospital and surrounding area. West Limerick 102 is broadcast from Newcastle West. The national broadcaster, RT\u00c9, has radio and television studios in the city, which are periodically used to broadcast programming from Limerick.\n\n\n=== Print ===\nSeveral local newspapers are published in the city, including The Limerick Post and The Limerick Leader and magazines include the Limerick Event Guide, Business Limerick and Limerick Now.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\nLimerick city is approximately 25 km from Shannon Airport. Tourist attractions in the city centre include Limerick City Museum, King John's Castle (1210), St Mary's Cathedral (1168), the Hunt Museum, the University of Limerick, Georgian houses and gardens and the Treaty Stone.  There are several seasonal tours, including Angela's Ashes walking tour of Limerick City, historical walking tour, and boat tours along the River Shannon.\nThe city centre is divided between the traditional areas of \"English Town\" on the southern end of King's Island, which includes the King John's Castle; \"Irish Town\", which includes the older streets on the south bank; and the current economic centre further south, called \"Newtown Pery\". Newtown Pery was built in the late 18th century before the Act of Union and, unusually for an Irish city and unique in Limerick, is laid out on a grid plan. The Limerick City Museum (formerly aka the Jim Kemmy Municipal Museum), is located in Istabraq Hall, City Hall, Merchant's Quay. It contains displays on Limerick's history and manufactures.\n\nThe Georgian core of the city, with its Georgian architecture in the Newtown Pery, was developed from the mid 18th century. This core includes O'Connell Street (George Street before independence) from the Cecil Street intersection running to the south west end of the Crescent, and south-east to Pery Street including Glentworth Street and Barrington Street. Other buildings of architectural note in the city are St John's Cathedral, designed by the notable Victorian architect, Philip Charles Hardwick. St Mary's Cathedral, at over 800 years old, is one of the oldest in Ireland. St John's Cathedral, whilst more modern, has Ireland's tallest spire at 94 m (308 ft).\nThe Hunt Museum is based in the historic 18th-century former Custom House. The museum was established to house a collection of approximately 2000 works of art and antiquities formed by John and Gertrude Hunt during their lifetimes.\nThe main park in Limerick is the People's Park which was opened in 1877 in memory of Richard Russell, a prominent local business man. The park is dominated by the Thomas Spring Rice memorial (MP for the city 1820\u20131832) and has a large collection of mature deciduous and evergreen trees.\nLimerick city centre changed significantly with the construction of several modern high-rise buildings in the early 2000s, in particular as part of the regeneration of the former docks area along the Dock Road. The suburban areas, where the majority of the population now live, have grown out from the centre along the main roads to Ennis (North Circular and Ennis Road areas/Caherdavin), Dublin (Castletroy and the University) and Cork (Ballinacurra/Dooradoyle/Raheen). Suburban houses are generally two-floor semi-detached homes for single families. These were built from the 1950s onwards in large estates by government projects and commercial developments, although there are many examples of Edwardian and older 1930s suburban homes on the main suburban thoroughfares leading towards the city (North & South Circular, Ballinacurra Road, O'Connell Avenue).\n\nLimerick city's nightlife is supported by a number of nightclubs and pubs which offer music. For example, Dolan's Warehouse is a small music venue which hosts local, national and international folk, indie, jazz, rock and traditional Irish music acts.In County Limerick, Adare village and the Foynes Flying Boat Museum, approximately 35 km (22 miles/30 minutes) from Limerick City along the scenic coastal N69 route from Limerick to Tralee, are also attractions. Bunratty Castle in County Clare is another local attraction, and is situated 15.4 km north of the city. Limerick is known to be the antipodes to the Campbell Islands of New Zealand.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nLimerick is the third largest city in Ireland (after Dublin and Cork) with a population of 94,192 in the urban area and 104,952 in the metropolitan district, according to the 2016 CSO census. The past census reported a large population decline in central city areas due in part to the Limerick regeneration process where in these areas the largest reduction was reported nationally and also to outward migration following the collapse of the local and national economy from 2008 onwards. The population of the Limerick Larger Urban Zone as defined by the EU is 162,413. The ethnic diversity in Limerick's population, which includes a large immigrant community, saw rapid growth during the Celtic Tiger and the following decade. The Polish community is one of the largest demographic groups in the Municipal District, with approximately 4,000 living and working in the area. Ireland's first Polish bank opened in 2007. The African community has set up a number of churches, which are now part of the cultural makeup of the city.Limerick has a large stock of local authority housing. Prior to the merger of Limerick City and County Council 41% of all housing within the old Limerick City Council boundary was local authority, which was the highest in Ireland. This figure is however no longer accurate given the larger metropolitan district of the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nLimerick is in the region dubbed \"the Midwest\". Also known as the \"Shannon Region\", this is primarily an economic and social concept. The region encompasses County Limerick, County Clare, North County Tipperary, Northwest County Kerry and south County Offaly, with its focal point centred on Limerick and its environs within an 8-kilometre (5 mi) radius.\nThe area is the main economic region in Ireland outside Dublin and Cork. Its economic development has been driven in part by the University of Limerick, Limerick Institute of Technology, Shannon Airport in County Clare and Shannon Development (an economic development agency), whose precursor was SFADCO (Shannon Free Airport Development Company), an economic agency that provided tax incentives to companies locating in the area surrounding Shannon Airport. As of 2006 Shannon Development was mostly concerned with disposing of valuable industrial park properties. Limerick Chamber of Commerce, a representative body for businesses in the region, celebrated its bicentennial/bicentenary in 2015.\nHistorically Limerick was an agricultural commodity-driven economy, due to its position as the first major port along the River Shannon. By the middle of the 18th century, Limerick Port grew to become one of Ireland's principal commercial ports, exporting agricultural produce from the most fertile tracts in Ireland known as the Golden Vale as well as produce from the surrounding counties. The city was one of the main meat processing areas in Ireland, and industry included confectionery and flour production. The city was known for its bacon industry \u2013 however this went into decline in the mid-20th century. The fishing industry in Limerick, based on Clancy's Strand opposite King John's Castle and at Coonagh nearby, once employed hundreds of men. The boat most commonly used was the Gandelow which was also used as a small Lighter (barge) to ferry goods to and from larger ships in the port. In the 1920s the construction of a dam at Ardnacrusha severely impacted salmon breeding and that, and the introduction of quotas, had by the 1950s caused salmon fishing to diminish. By 2006, most fishermen had relinquished their drift net licences and the industry can now be said to be dormant.As with other cities in Ireland, a number of multinational companies are based in Limerick, and the city is a growing recipient of foreign direct investment. Dell had its main European Manufacturing Facility at the Raheen Business Park however in January 2009 Dell announced that it would close its Limerick computer manufacturing plant and move the production lines to Poland. The facility was the largest Dell manufacturing plant outside the United States and produced 30,000\u201360,000 units per day for export to the EMEA. Dell remains one of the largest employers in the mid-west with over 1,000 people employed in service and support. Analog Devices has its European manufacturing base in Raheen, 3 km south-west of the city centre. The site employs more than 1,000 people. Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Vistakon (the world's largest manufacturer of contact lenses) has a large facility in Castletroy in the National Technology Park and also employs close to 1,000 people. It is Vistakon's only production facility outside the United States and one of the largest contact-lens manufacturing plants in the world. Cook Medical, the world's largest privately owned Medical Devices company, employs over 800 people in Limerick at the National Technology Park.\nThe Post-2008 Irish economic downturn had a profound effect on Limerick. The announcement in 2009 that Dell was to move its manufacturing facility from Limerick to Poland devastated the local economy. 1,900 jobs were lost at Dell and it is believed that for every job that was lost at Dell at least another 4 to 5 were at risk. The closure of the Dell manufacturing facility amounted to 2% of Ireland's national GDP. The downturn in the construction industry also cost many jobs as did the stalled Limerick regeneration programme which promised investment in Limerick's deprived city areas. As of 2012 unemployment had become a major problem across the city with the unemployment rate in the city at 28.6% which was almost twice the national average.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nThe Crescent Shopping Centre is the largest shopping centre in Ireland, outside of Dublin, and the largest in the province of Munster. It is located in Dooradoyle about 3 km south of the city centre, and has over 90 shopping outlets along with restaurants and a 12-screen Omniplex Cinema. The city centre also has a large retail district which includes a mix of more traditional type of shops as well as some modern high street stores. Cruises Street is one of the main shopping streets. O'Connell Street, William Street, Bedford Row and Thomas Street) are also retail streets within the city. The city centre saw some works on remodelling in the early 21st century, with pedestrianisation works on Bedford Row, Thomas Street and parts of Catherine Street, as well as widening footpaths on William Street. These works have sought to address a reduction of footfall in the city centre (in turn influencing the closure of many city centre retail businesses) which occurred from the recession of 2008 onwards.\n\n\n==== Retail parks and shopping centres ====\n\nDuring the Celtic Tiger years a number of shopping centres and retail parks opened in suburban areas of Limerick. In addition to the Crescent Shopping Centre, which expanded in the early 2000s, the Jetland Shopping Centre opened in Caherdavin in 2005. The Childers Road Retail Park and the Parkway Shopping Centre in the east of the city also have a number of high street stores. Unfinished retail centres include the Coonagh Cross retail development and the Parkway Valley Shopping Centre on the Dublin Road. A proposed but unapproved retail development project, the Opera Centre, makes up part of the \"Limerick 2030\" scheme.\n\n\n==== The Milk Market ====\nThe Milk Market located at Cornmarket Row in the city centre sells locally produced foods and products and is governed by Limerick Market Trustees. In 2010 work was undertaken to redevelop the existing premises to an all-weather, all year round facility as it operated in an outdoor environment. The work involved constructing a large canopy over the existing market premises and was officially re-opened in June 2010. The Milk Market Project won the 2011 Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI) 'Peoples Choice Award'.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nIn 2013, a renewable energy strategy was launched for the region, and proposed a 20% reduction in CO2-emissions, while ensuring that short-term actions were beneficial to the long-term goal of 100% renewable energy. The strategy was completed by the Danish Aalborg University.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\nShannon Airport is 20 km west of the city in County Clare. It is one of Ireland's main airports and is easily accessible from Limerick via the N18 dual carriageway and from other regions via the Limerick Tunnel. It has scheduled flights to European and North American destinations. Airlines using the airport include Ryanair, Aer Lingus, United Airlines, American Airlines, Aer Lingus Regional and Delta Air Lines. There is no rail link to the airport. Coonagh airfield, a few kilometres west of Caherdavin, serves small private aircraft. Kerry and Cork Airports are around 1 hour 30 minutes and 2 hours drive away, respectively. Kerry Airport is connected to Farranfore railway station, from Limerick railway station travel via Limerick Junction and Mallow.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nLocal public transport is provided by several companies. Bus \u00c9ireann, Ireland's state-owned bus company, operates a number of services subsidised by the National Transport Authority, while a number of provide operators also run commercial bus services in and around Limerick. An updated city bus network was introduced in Limerick City in December 2016, which introduced new routes. In May 2019, Bus \u00c9ireann further changed and improved the Limerick City timetable, including increased frequency and later operating times.\nOther rural buses run to towns and villages in the county and to Shannon Airport. There are also a number of Intercity and international buses from Bus \u00c9ireann's bus terminal adjoining Limerick Colbert railway station. These include hourly services to Dublin, Cork, Ennis and Galway. Bus \u00c9ireann have also commenced a Limerick to Galway Express service travelling on the M18 in addition to the regular service. Buses run every 2 hours to Tralee and Killarney. There are also regular daily services to Waterford and Athlone, and a daily service to London via the ferry from Rosslare Europort.\nThere are a number of private bus companies in operation providing city and intercity services. Dublin Coach provide the M7 express service which operates every hour from Arthur's Quay which goes to Dublin or Ennis. JJ Kavanagh also provide Dublin to Limerick services from Arthur's Quay. Citylink run a number of services from Limerick to Galway and Cork and operate from Henry Street.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nIarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann's Limerick Colbert station is the railway hub for the city and the Mid West Region with a number of intercity and commuter rail services. Limerick railway station opened on 28 August 1858, replacing an earlier, temporary station 500 m east, which had operated from 9 May 1848.The following inter city routes are available from Limerick Colbert station :\n\nLimerick to Dublin Heuston: 16 services daily including 4 direct services. All remaining Dublin \u2013 Limerick services require passengers to change to the Dublin to Cork train at either Limerick Junction or at Ballybrophy railway station.\nLimerick to Waterford: 2 services daily (but none on Sundays). Passengers must change train at Limerick Junction to continue to Waterford with stations at Tipperary, Cahir, Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir.\nLimerick to Galway: 5 services daily. This service reopened on 29 March 2010.\nLimerick to Cork: Passengers can travel between Limerick and Cork via Limerick Junction. There is no direct service.\nLimerick to Killarney, Farranfore and Tralee: Passengers can travel between Limerick and Killarney, Farranfore and Tralee via Limerick Junction where trains run via Mallow to reach County Kerry.There are 3 suburban/commuter services in the Limerick Suburban Rail network:\n\nLimerick \u2013 Ennis calling at Sixmilebridge\nLimerick \u2013 Nenagh calling at Castleconnell and Birdhill (with some services continuing to Cloughjordan & Roscrea & connecting to the Dublin-Cork railway line at Ballybrophy.) Due to speed restrictions this alternative Dublin \u2013 Limerick route can take 60 minutes longer (with a change at Ballybrophy) than by Limerick Junction albeit a more direct service.\nLimerick \u2013 Limerick Junction and ThurlesThere are also a number of disused railway lines including the Limerick to Foynes line which closed to freight in the early 2000s, having lost passenger services in the early 1960s, although the track is still in situ.  This is the last remaining part of the North Kerry Line which closed to passenger traffic in the early 1960s and to freight traffic (other than Limerick \u2013 Foynes) in the mid-1970s, and has been lifted between Ballingrane (near Rathkeale) and Tralee.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nLimerick's central location in the mid\u2013west of Ireland means many national primary routes converge on the city. The M7 (Dublin), N/M18 (Galway, Ennis, Shannon), N/M20 (Cork), N21 (Tralee) and N24 (Waterford) routes all start/terminate in or near the city. Road infrastructure is further supplemented by the southern ring road and Limerick Tunnel bypass of the city and the M20 bypass of Dooradoyle and Raheen to the south of the city. Connections to the other cities were improved with the completion of the M7 motorway in December 2010, and continuing upgrades ongoing to the N/M18 to Shannon, Ennis, Galway and Tuam \u2013 the final section opened in September 2017. A motorway is also planned between Cork and Limerick, with a proposed completion date in the mid 2020s.\n\n\n=== Waterway transport ===\nHistorically, waterway transport has been key to Limerick's development. Vikings established the city as a maritime trading port. The city's position on a major Irish river system, the Shannon, enabled transport to the midlands of Ireland and further north and west. By the 18th century with the opening of canal systems throughout Ireland, Limerick Port established itself as Ireland's premier commercial port on the western side of the country. This was enabled by ease of access from the facilitated by the opening of canals but most importantly to the River Shannon. The opening of the Grand Canal in the 18th century provided further access to Dublin and the east of the country. There are also a number of disused canals in the vicinity of the city including the Park Canal & the Passey \u2013 Errina Canal on the old Limerick navigation. Waterway transport on the Shannon was regularly used to transport goods from Limerick to Dublin and vice versa however this mode of transport fell into decline in the 20th century. Originally Limerick port was located near the confluence of the Abbey and Shannon rivers at King's Island. Today the Shannon Foynes Port is located further downstream on the Shannon alongside the Dock Road. This general purpose facility port is operated by the Shannon Foynes Port Company who operate all marine activities in the Shannon estuary.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nLimerick is a centre of higher education in the region, and technical and continuation education within the city traces its beginning back to the formation of the Limerick Athenaeum Society in 1852, marking the foundation of the Limerick Institute of Technology.

        "wiki": "Grange stone circle (Lios na Gr\u00e1ins\u00ed or Fort of the Grange) 300m west of Lough Gur in County Limerick, Ireland, is situated beside the Limerick-Kilmallock road, 4 km north of Bruff.\n\n\n== Features ==\nThe stone circle comprises a continuous ring of 113 uprights up to 2.8m high, with a diameter of 45m and backed by an earthen bank 9m wide and about 1.2m tall. The entrance on the eastern side is paved and flanked by uprights. Clay has been packed down to a depth of 60 cm across the whole area of the enclosure. On excavation it was found to be littered with late Neolithic Beaker pottery, which seemed to have been deliberately smashed. Its near perfect shape and the discovery of a posthole in the very centre of the enclosure, indicates that the circle was measured out from a central stake with a rope. Twelve large orthostats have been placed at intervals around the stone ring, each standing directly opposite one of the other 'axial' stones. The stones are contiguous rather than free-standing, and the surrounding bank makes it look more like a form of henge monument than a conventional stone circle. This embankment and the precise arrangement of orthostats suggest that this site had a ritual purpose.The largest stone is Rannach Chruim Duibh (Crom Dubh's Division)  and is over 4m high and weighs 40 tonnes. The entrance of the circle is aligned with the rising sun at the Summer Solstice. The entrance stones are matched by a pair of equally impressive slabs on the southwest side, whose tops slope down towards each other to form a v-shape. During excavations no structures were found but two hearths; a few un-burnt human bones, some animal bones (mainly cattle), some bronze materials and numerous Neolithic pottery pieces were discovered.A short distance to the north-north east of the main stone circle, is a second smaller circle, also constructed of large stones. To the north of this is a large leaning standing stone.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "I guess I thought the visitor's center would be closer to the actual stone circle. We went to the stone circle first, so we didn't have the full history and background. Without that, it's basically just a circle of big stones. Do your homework and see the visitor's center first.",

          "Such a fantastic site. The cows add to the peacefulness of the site. Gps co ords help get there, otherwise go to the town of Bluff and take r512 it's about 1km up the road car park on the right.",
          "Totally worthy to stop and see it. It is free and almost without tourists. A great Irish scenery and the kids had great fun with the calves.",
          "The Grange Stone Circle is a local historical site for me and my family. Its location is next to the beautiful Lough Gur and defenitely worth a stop on your way to the lake. Fantastic history and a great picture opportunity aswell. Parking is fairly limited and it is on a",

          "Very atmospheric setting when we visited a t sunset. Biggest stone circle in Ireland in quite location in countryside.",
          "Just fascinating; take the time and read the story you will be amazed. The largest stone circle in Ireland and about 2000 yrs old.",
          "I was blown away by the size and quality of this circle. Looking forward to a visit during the solstice.",

          "I was driving into Bruff for a visit, and spotted this on the way. It is really easy to get to, and very well maintained. I have since discovered it is the biggest circle of its kind in Ireland, so I am very glad not to have passed it by. There was a really magical atmosphere",
          "Having driven past this attraction hundreds of times in the past 25 years I finally decided to take a look in today. I was not disappointed! A large stone circle, larger than I expected, is well maintained and if it was not so bitterly cold today I can imagine you could stay",
          "This is a great stone circle just on the Limerick/Kilmallock road. It is free to enter so but the local farm owner does his best to get you to pay a tip, which is annoying. This is a very impressive stone circle, largest in Ireland, and well preserved. I live about 20km away so",
          "If you are unto history then this is a very nice place to visit. Good information sign and very well maintained. One of the oldest sites in Ireland.Only short distance outside Bruff, which is a lovely irish rural village.",

          "Loved witnessing ancient times. Trying to imagine how our fore fathers built this magnificent stone circle. Makes me feel we are  missing something!?",
          "Interesting location. As I notice people are leaving items on one stone and notes on tree behind that stone. Some are having family time and kids are playing.",
          "I can't find any information as to why there is old fruit and other paraphernalia left there. Largest stone circle in Ireland",
          "Well maintained and evocative place. Makes the Bronze age feel like not long ago. The whole area is beautiful and worth a visit any time of the year.",
          "One of the oldest historical landmark in Ireland. The largest and finest stone circle in Ireland. You can visit to Lough Gur lake as well if you come to this place because Lough Gur is near to this place.\nVinesh Vlogger - Malayalam YouTuber !!!",
          "Worth a look if you're in the area, I wouldn't make a special trip though unless you're really in to this stuff. Beware cowpats disguised as stepping stones. Plenty of parking at the roadside.",

          "Awesome place.",
          "Wonderful Neolithic site just a bit off the beaten path between Cork and the Cliffs of Moher. Highly recommend a stop. There is also a nearby visitor center and more Neolithic sites. It truly is a site to behold standing in front of these stones.",
          "My first visit to the stone circle and it won\u2019t be the last. Early morning \u2014 around 8:30 or so \u2014 for sunrise! Humbling to stand in the same place as ancient man (and women)! If you go be sure to make a contribution for the maintenance\u2014 as it is in private land.",

          "Highly recommend the self-guided tour with audio that tells of settlers to this area 8,000 years ago. Small visitors center is not the main attraction, imo. It's seeing where dwellings once were, challenges faced, etc. Park-like setting is inviting enough to spend a day here.",
          "Hauntingly filled with spiritual energy of the ancients. If it's the warm season, take your shoes off and feel the energy beneath your feet as you enter the circle.",

          "Magical stone ring , with extremly strong energy emission, in the centre.",
          "Its  a stone circle which is not that impressive because there is nothing which shows us the history of the place or the reason why these stones came into place. It's near the Lough Gur lake as well as the Terra Nova fairy garden. So can visit this place to just get a feel of a stone circle.",
          "A short stop to see paleolithic stones.  Very nice.",
          "Easily accessible place for a pit stop. Good nice place to take some photos. You can go around the stone circle and enjoy the area. Enough area to park upto 10 cars. If you pass through the area just stop and enjoy. It is very close to Lough gur. In the same route you can also see the lough gur cemetery",
          "This is the largest stone circle in Ireland and is very intriguing.",
          "Gorgeous place. Well preserved. I felt so calm and serene while there. Has a very interesting history.",
          "If you're into the ancient stone circles it's well worth a detour, however there isn't much in the area. It's a really well preserved circle and feels AMAZING. \n\nYa know, if you're into feeling the power of places this one is pretty darned cool. If so, btw, do NOT miss the Hill of Tara.",
          "After being at Stonehenge (England) and Ggantija (Malta) the structures leave much to be desired. A visit might be worth if you want to feel in touch with the ancient men and women that lived off these lands.",

          "Such a cool place to step into and realize you are setting foot where powerful things happened almost 6000 years ago!",
          "This monument is worth a 10-minute stop if you're in the area.  It's a circular stone monument, likely used for rituals during prehistoric times.  It's said to be the second largest stone circle in Ireland and is in great condition.  However, this site doesn't make for an exciting adventure.",
          "Very interesting, a little far away from everything. A 10 minutes visite.",

          "This is a very interesting little stop. It's older than Stonehenge and it is very well intact. The price of admission is simply a donation to keep up the property and the cows roaming around inside are very nice addition to the decor.",

Walk anti-clockwise to let go of something or clockwise to embrace something instead. There is a lot of energy in this stone circle. Come and find out for yourself!",

        "wiki": "Adare (; Irish: \u00c1th Dara, meaning \"ford of [the] oak\") is a village in County Limerick, Ireland, located south-west of the city of Limerick. Renowned as one of Ireland's prettiest towns, Adare is designated as a heritage town by the Irish government.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe River Maigue is tidal as far as Adare, with the settlement forming around the eastern bank of the Maigue overlooking the fording point from which the village gets its name. An annalistic reference is made in the medieval Annals of Inisfallen at AI982.4 \"The Tree of Mag Adar was broken by Leth Cuinn\". Owing to the strategic importance of the river crossing the Desmond castle was built overlooking the site near Ardshanbally (derived from Ard an tSeanbhaile - 'high ground of the old town'), and was first mentioned in 1226. Historically a market town, in the Middle Ages, Adare boasted three monasteries. Owing to the influence of the Earls of Dunraven, who built the Adare Manor (now a luxury resort hotel) a strict plan was laid out for the town.\n\n\n=== Desmond Castle ===\n\nA castle or fortress is said to have first been built with an ancient ring-fort, by the O'Donovans, rulers of the region into the late 12th century, and afterwards to have passed into the possession of the Kildare branch of the FitzGerald dynasty, who may be responsible for the majority of the remains of the present fortress (which occurred with Croom Castle, also on the Maigue). Desmond Castle, as it is popularly known, stands on the north bank of the Maigue. An extensive renovation has been in progress on the castle since 1996 and supervised tours are offered in the summer months.  This is one of a series of significant Desmond properties, which also include Desmond Hall and Castle in Newcastle West, another castle in Askeaton and Castle Matrix near Rathkeale, further west in County Limerick.\n\n\n=== Augustinian Priory ===\n\nAdare's Augustinian Priory was founded in 1316 by John FitzThomas FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Kildare. The Priory was suppressed in the reign of Henry VIII. In 1807, the church of the Priory was given to the local Church of Ireland congregation as the parish church. In 1814, the refectory was roofed and converted into a schoolhouse. Between 1852 and 1854, a second restoration of the church was undertaken by Caroline, Countess of Dunraven.\n\n\n=== Franciscan Abbey ===\nThe Franciscan friary was founded in 1464 by Thomas Fitz-Maurice, 7th Earl of Kildare and his wife Joan, and completed two years later. It is currently a ruin and is located inside the Adare Manor Golf Club.\n\n\n=== Trinitarian Abbey ===\n\nThe Trinitarian Order established their only monastery in Ireland in Adare in 1230. It is believed that the Trinitarian monks who came to Adare may have come from Scotland. The Abbey was restored in 1811 by the first Earl of Dunraven as the Catholic Parish church.\n\n\n=== Adare Manor ===\nAdare Manor is a mansion located on lands on the banks of the River Maiguem and the former seat of the Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl. The present building was built in the early 19th-century in a Tudor-revival style, while retaining part of an earlier structure. It is now the Adare Manor Hotel & Golf Resort, a luxury resort hotel, reopened after an extensive restoration in October 2017.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe main street combines typical Irish architecture with the English styled buildings and infrastructure purpose-built for the Dunraven estate. Examples of the latter architectural forms include the thatched cottages near the entrance to Adare Manor.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAdare is a tourist destination and the local heritage centre, which gives insight into the history of the village, also hosts a number of craft shops. The village is a wedding and conference venue. Adare has two 18-hole golf courses - the Adare Golf Club, which incorporates a driving range and which was the site of the 2007 and 2008 Irish Open, the Adare Manor Golf Club and a pitch and putt course. Adare also has an equestrian centre, located  in Clonshire.\n\n\n=== Schools ===\nThere are four primary schools in Adare: St Joseph's National School (Catholic, boys), Our Lady's Abbey National School (Catholic, girls), St Nicholas' National School (Church of Ireland, mixed) and Shountrade National School (Catholic, mixed). The village's secondary school, Adare CBS, closed in 1973.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nThe main Limerick-Tralee road, the N21 passes through the village, causing persistent heavy congestions.  In late 2015 a corridor for the long-delayed bypass was chosen that realigns the N21 road north of the village as part of a new dual carriageway planned to link Foynes port to Limerick.\nAdare is a stop on Bus \u00c9ireann's Limerick-Tralee/Killarney bus service and Dublin Coach's Dublin-Tralee/Killarney service. Both run hourly.\nThe abandoned \"Limerick-Foynes\" railway line passes 800 metres (half a mile) to the north-west of the town. Adare railway station, opened on 12 July 1856 by the Limerick & Foynes Railway company, was closed to passengers on 4 February 1963 and to freight on 2 December 1974. The line to Foynes continued to carry freight traffic until it was mothballed in 2001 and has seen no trains since 7 May 2002 when the annual Irish Rail weedspray train visited the line. The line, designated an engineers siding, is still officially open for traffic.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nAdare GAA club was founded in 1929. The senior hurling team has won the county championship in 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 and 2009. In football, the Club won the County Intermediate Football Title in 2016 and gained promotion back to The Limerick Senior Football Championship. In 2017, Adare won the County Senior Title for the first time, beating Newcastle West in the Final. In 2018, the club went on to retain the title, becoming the first team in Limerick GAA history to win 2 senior titles immediately following success at intermediate level.\nThe local soccer team is Adare United AFC. The club play at Deer Park Field, situated just off the Blackabbey Road in the village. Founded in 1937, Adare has one of the oldest soccer clubs outside Limerick city. Adare United participate in the Limerick Desmond Schoolboys/Girls League at Under 8, U10, U12, U14 and U16 age groups and in the Limerick Desmond League at Junior (adult) and Youth level. The 2006/07 Season saw the club form its first ladies team, who compete in the Limerick Desmond Ladies League. In the 2009/10 Season, the ladies were runners up in the League Cup, losing on penalties to Glin Rovers FC. The team were also cup finalists the following year, this time in the Desmond Cup but were beaten by Murroe FC. The Under 10 team were Division 3 Champions in the 2008/09 season and Division 4 winners in 2010/11. The Under 8 team completed a league and cup double in 2010/11. The Junior team won promotion from Division Two in the 2008/2009 season and immediately gained promotion to the premier league the following year. Adare Ladies won the Desmond Cup in the 2011/2012 season and were runners-up in League Division 1.\nThe Irish Open golf championship was staged there in 2007 and 2008. There are two 18-hole golf courses in the village: The Adare Golf Club which is on the grounds of the Adare Manor Hotel, and the Adare Manor Golf Club, which is a separate entity.\nThe Limerick Cricket Club play in the manor fields complex to the south of the village.\nThe town also plays a role in the West Limerick athletics scene, with it hosting the Adare 10K run every February since 1994.\n\n\n== Twin towns ==\nAdare has twinning connections to its sister towns in Germany.\n\nBuchloe, Germany\nBuckow, Germany\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of towns and villages in Ireland\nNicholas Peacock\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAdare Heritage Centre\nShannon Region Tourism's page on Adare\nGeneral Information on Adare\nObituary of the 7th Earl of Dunraven, Thady Wyndham-Quin\nIndex of the Earl of Dunraven Papers at the University of Limerick\nAdare local area plan (Limerick County Council)(2002)\nThe Tidy Towns of Ireland \"Celebrating 50 years\"\nKnockpatrick Gardens\nBunbury, Turtle, Adare Manor: The Renaissance of an Irish Country House (Adare Manor Publishing, 2019) ISBN 9781527246706",

        "wiki": "Lough Gur (Irish: Loch Goir) is a lake in County Limerick, Ireland between the towns of Herbertstown and Bruff. The lake forms a horseshoe shape at the base of Knockadoon Hill and some rugged elevated countryside. It is one of Ireland's most important archaeological sites. Humans have lived near Lough Gur since about 3000 BC and there are numerous megalithic remains there.Grange stone circle (the largest stone circle in Ireland) and a dolmen are located near the lake. The remains of at least three crannogs are present, and remains of Stone Age houses have been unearthed (the house outlines are known as \"The Spectacles\"). A number of ring forts are found in the area, with one hill fort overlooking the lake. Some are Irish national monuments.It is here that the 14th-century lord of Munster and poet Gear\u00f3id Iarla, votary of the Goddess \u00c1ine, is said to sleep in a cave and emerge at time of Ireland's need to gallop around the lake on his great silver-shod white horse.A visitors' centre is open beside Lough Gur, along with a car park and picnic area. A gradual shore-line is present at the visitor area, with a shallow section of lake reaching up to the maintained lawn. As a result, the area is often used for water sports, though motorised craft are banned on the lake.There is a castle, or tower house (closed to visitors) near the entrance to the carpark. Named Bourchier's Castle after Sir George Bourchier, the son of the second Earl of Bath, it lies at the neck of the peninsula around which the lake washes. There is some other architecture dating from more recent times, with the ruins of an early Christian church by the road leading down to the lake. At the far end of the lake are the ruins of a Norman castle, Black Castle, which is reached by a hill-side walk along the east side of the lake. This is one of the keeps used during the Desmond Rebellions, and is probably the place where the Earl of Desmond secured his authority in 1573 after casting off his English apparel and donning Irish garments on his return to Munster from London.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEarly history of Ireland\nList of loughs in Ireland\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Lough Gur at Wikimedia Commons\n\nLough Gur - official visitor centre site at Shannon Heritage\nLough Gur Neolithic Settlement and Stone Age Centre\nLough Gur Development site.\nGoogle Earth Community KMZ file indicating the location of several important Lough Gur sites.",

          "We stumbled across Lough Gur while driving, its a twisty road to get to but the views are well worth it. We were here in January and although quite cold and foggy the view is still great and worth the 100 step climb. Be careful on wet days as steps can be quite slippy and",

          "Very worth the trip to hire a car and get to this location. It's truly a destination off the beaten path. I loved the peace and remoteness of it. The highlights after obtaining a map from the visitor center were: the spectacles stones, 110 stone steps, beautiful viewing points",
          "Well worth a visit. See how our ancient ancestors lived and in such a beautiful setting. Pathways all around with benches at the top of the hill to view the lake. Visitor centre is a replica of settlement. So interesting to see how people lived and survived. Friendly locals.",

          "This is a wonderful place, especially if you catch it at a quiet time when the staff have time to talk to you and the experience can feel a little more authentic. With crowds, it loses a lot of it's charm.",

          "For a stroll around the lake, it can be great if the weather is good. The actual sight is disappointing though, as is the small museum. Some screens were closed when we were there and thus we were allowed to enter for free. This made it ok value for money... But, bring a picnic",

          "Being no 1 attraction in Limerick you would expect a place packed with great scenery and attractions. To be honest this place is the opposite. Dull and quite boring theres not much to walk to. Going inside cost \u20ac5+ which in my mind is very expensive. Something like Clare Glen",
          "We recently visited in July with 2 adults and 2 kids aged 10 & 13. We were looking for a stop off for our trip to Kerry, somewhere to stretch our legs and have a picnic. There are numerous picnic benches dotted around a lake with scenic views and some ducks. Toilets are easy to",

          "Great place to go with family especially kids.You would want to be fairly active,because there is a lot of walking and climbing.The visitor centre is a real let down because the little coffee shop is not fit for purpose. A lot of public money has been spent on this historical",
          "Spend a lovely few hours roaming around Lough Gur, it is a beautiful tranquil place that I never knew existed. On arriving we were greeted by Philip who explained we would get a set of head phones with our entry fee to the visitors centre. The audio guide gives you lots of",
          "First thing to know about this place is that you need to be physically fit to see the outdoor exhibits on site, not to mention the equally excellent archaeological remains in the surrounding area (listed on the map you'll get). The centre is small but has a nice museum and",

        "wiki": "The Adare Friary, located in Adare, County Limerick, Ireland, formerly known as the \"Black Abbey\", is an Augustinian Friary founded in 1316 by the Earl of Kildare. It is now known as \"St. Nicholas' Church of Ireland\" parish church, and St Nicholas' National School.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Augustinian friars first came to Dublin from England in about 1260. They were invited to Adare by John FitzThomas FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Kildare in 1316 and given land and houses in the town.By 1541 the Augustinian friars owned nearly 80 acres (320,000 m2) of land, several cottages and gardens in the village and a fishing weir on the river. As part of the Tudor suppression of Irish Monasteries at the end of the 16th century, the Augustinians were driven out of Adare and had moved to Limerick city by 1633.\nMany of the features of the friary are very well preserved, particularly the small 15th century cloister and sedilia.\nThe garth is small and square, and the piers are relatively narrow and buttress-like, with boldly moulded plinths repeated along the base walls. The arches between them are relatively high and four-centred and the triple openings are set centrally in the walls, with unglazed mullioned windows. Their heads are round and cinque-cusped. All the ambulatories have rather flat vaulting, groined on the north and west, three-centred to the other walks. The relative elaboration is thanks to the Geraldine patronage which explains the Geraldine Arms carved on the inner spandrils of the east arcade.\nThe interior of the church must have originally been coloured with medieval murals of red and yellow with black lining.\nThe Pieta is a beautifully sensitive piece of wood carving believed to be 16th-century Flemish.\nThe massive oak door from the choir to the vestry is an ancient one which was removed from the old parish church of St. Nicholas.\nThe string course below the parapet on the south side aisle consists of late stone bosses including a Tudor rose.    \nThe Dunraven family continued restoration work on the friary through the 19th century.\n\n\n== Modern uses ==\n\n\n=== Church ===\nThe church is now used by the Church of Ireland to serve the region of Adare. It is a part of the wider Adare union of parishes, which also includes Croom, Kilpeacon and Kilmallock.\n\n\n=== School ===\nSt Nicholas' National School was established by the Earl of Dunraven in 1814, becoming a national school in 1862. It is a co-educational primary school with a Church of Ireland ethos.\nThe school was originally housed in the refectory of the friary. In early 2007, construction began on a new school building behind the original monastery. The building has three classrooms and has sedum growing on its roof. The old school had two classrooms divided by a partition wall. \nConstruction was completed in August 2008, with teachers and pupils moving into the new school in September, at the start of the new school year. On 12 December 2008, the building was officially opened by Mary Hanafin TD, who was the Minister for Education and Science when construction started. The old building is now used for PE and drama classes.\n\n\n== Burials ==\nWindham Wyndham-Quin, 5th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl\nWindham Wyndham-Quin, 4th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl\nValentine Quin, 1st Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl\nJohn FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Kildare\nThomas FitzGerald, 2nd Earl of Kildare\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of abbeys and priories in Ireland (County Limerick)\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Founded in 1315 it is a beautiful example of a church that has survived centuries of wars and the passage of time. A great stop on your tour of the village.",
          "I went to school in the old abbey here, before the new school was built. Looking back, it was an an amazing and unique experience to go to school in a place so steeped in history, and set in such a picturesque location. A tour of the cloisters in the dark is fun if you're",
          "Some empty walls you can wander through in a few minutes. Part of the building is a functioning school. If you're walking Adare, stop in but not worth a separate trip.",
          "I stumbled on this place not knowing exactly what it was. It was lovely to wander around the inside of the Friary, and then into the church. And, being January, on a late Saturday afternoon, no one else was about, so I had the place to myself. Another beautiful, serene space,",
          "I love old architecture, historical places and graveyards. When I travel, it is wonderful to stumble upon them while I am exploring things to see and do in the area. It was great to wander around with my camera, taking pictures that have become warm memories of my time spent in",
          "This old Friary building is right on the edge of town as you enter from the Northeast on the main road. It is important to note that while there is the Friary building there is also an active school in session on the property as well as part of the same structure. On the rear",
          "We stayed in townhouses at Adare Manor, and this Augustinian Friary is right across the road, alongside the Maigue river. On the outside it looks like a lot of other old churches, but when you go inside, the thing that strikes you is the beauty of the stained glass windows.",
          "Thai is an interesting link to the past. There was a guy there who was very helpful giving us the history of the place. Cromwell and Henry VIII have a lot to answer for!",
          "The Heritage Center told us where the friary was, a ten minute walk, and it was; HOWEVER, we could not enter the chapel. The outside looked pretty cool, but I wanted to see the inside.",
          "Heading out of town towards the main entrance to Adare Manor, you'll pass the Old Augustinian Friary & chuch on the left. We headed over to check it out as we couldn't pass up such a historical looking building just sitting there calling to us. The church is still functioning",
          "this is such a beautiful and special church. My husband and I were married in this church on 10-10-10. It has so much history and a must see as well as the little town of Adare which we cherish every visit. If we could, we would move to Adare and live there forever.. Please",
          "We visited just at sunset and the light (or lack of it) made the place truly surreal. The town had experienced a terrible wind storm just a week before so some giant trees were down and it was incredible that the ruins did not sustain more damage. We visited three churches in",
          "Someplace that I never thought I would go, and seemed surreal when I was there. If you are a photographer, do not miss this opportunity. This is a great place to get amazing pictures!",
          "There are some very old buildings in Adare that make you feel like you got stuck in a time capsule hundreds of years ago. I loved the architecture of the Friary and would advise anyone to check it out! Beautiful grounds as well.",
          "For a small village, there's an awful lot to see. Beautiful buildings and ruins. Loads of history. Anyone driving through should really make an effort to stop and visit some of the lovely historical sites.",
          "We walked around and poking in all the corners, enjoyed going inside and looking at the amazing stain glassed windows, what a treat",
          "Check out the old Franciscan Friary on the Adare Manor Golf Course if you get a chance. It is right across from the 2nd fairway - very worth seeing!",
          "Nice place to visit, so historic, so gothic! Although not the nicest church we have visited since being in ireland (The Locke Restaurant in athlone, in a church, thats a WOW). Really nice place, alot of history! You would need over an hour to get through it all! Definetly",
          "Adare is a beautiful village. It is interesting to imagine what it was like in the 14th. century with three important monastic settlements. The Trinitarian Abbey or 'White Abbey' which looks like a crash between a tower house and a church is now restored as the Roman Catholic",
          "Nice to walk around and imagine what it once looked like. Even better is the riverwalk right next to it. Goes for about a mile.",
          "This place is quite nice and if you would like to visit the near Old Franciscan Friary, it worths for walkabout."

It is designated as a National Waymarked Trail by the National Trails Office of the Irish Sports Council and is managed by Shannon Development and Coillte.The trail begins in the village of Murroe and follows the road past Glenstal Abbey before crossing forestry along the slopes of the Slieve Felim Mountains to reach the village of Toor. From Toor, the Way crosses the flanks of Keeper Hill in the Silvermine Mountains before following the road into Silvermines village.A review of the National Waymarked Trails in 2010 found multiday and day usage of the trail to be low and recommended a review and strengthening of the trail management structures.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nFewer, Michael (1996).

      "name": "The Milk Market",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Milk Market (Irish: Margadh an Bhainne) is a food market located on Mungret Street, Limerick, Ireland. Despite the name, the market has diversified over the years from its initial purpose and now sells a wide variety of foodstuffs, much of which is produced locally. The market is one of the oldest in Ireland. The flagship market day is the Saturday food market, however, markets are also held on Fridays & Sundays.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe exact origins of The Milk Market are unknown but its location on Mungret Street in Limerick's Irishtown area can suggest a pre 19th century origin. In the early 19th century, there were a number of markets located in and around the city. It was suggested at this time that the various markets would be brought under a single management system. The Limerick Market Trustees was set up by an Act of the British Parliament, passed in 1852, to expand and manage the affairs of markets within the city boundary and its environs. In order to fulfill their charter the Trustees raised finance and acquired a large parcel of land in the Garryowen area of the city where many of the markets were relocated with the original market properties disposed of. The Butter Market, the Pig Market and the Hay Market were transferred to the new market area. The new market area eventually became a sports ground as is now known as the Markets Field stadium as eventually over time these markets began to fail. The Potato Market (on Merchant's Quay near the old Limerick Port) and the Corn Market (latterly known as the Milk Market) were retained in their original locations. The Potato Market ended in the 1940s, however the Corn Market or Milk Market, continued to thrive.  The nature of the produce traded there also changed. In addition to the sale of fruit and vegetables there was also lively trade in fowl, homemade butter and homemade breads and cakes. It was not until the 1950s that the market for bedding plants and shrubs began to grow and this range of produce expanded rapidly in the 1960s. Another feature of the Market during this period was the Christmas market for turkeys. Through much of its history (1897 - 1988) the Limerick Market Trustees was in receivership the longest receivership period in Irish history. Following the release of the Trustees from receivership an ambitious renovation of the Milk Market was undertaken. This project won a European Heritage Award and it was reopened on September 1, 1995.\n\n\n== Redevelopment ==\nIn 2004, the Trustees identified the need and the opportunity to undertake significant new works at Milk Market, in order to make it one of the finest markets in Ireland. These plans were realised in June 2010, with the opening of the redeveloped Milk Market as an all-weather, all year round market space following the construction of a large canopy over the top of the open air market. The venue now accommodates major markets on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays & occasional markets at other times, a daily Christmas market on the run up to Christmas; a new Food Pavilion and events. The Milk Market Project won the 2011 Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI) 'Peoples Choice Award'. Local architects Healy Partners Architects designed the project in conjunction with Schlaich Bergermann & Partner from Stuttgart, Germany. Also involved were local civil and structural engineers Dennany Reidy Associates.\n\n\n== Live at the Big \u2014 Top ==\n\nSince its redevelopment The Milk Market now also doubles as an entertainment venue with events marketed as Live at the Big \u2014 Top. Numerous top Irish & International music acts that have played at the venue since its redevelopment include:\n\nSin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor\nThe Coronas\nImelda May\nBell X1\nVillagers\nThe Stunning\nCalvin Harris\nThe Feeling\nThe Saw Doctors\nJosh Ritter\n\n\n== See also ==\nEnglish Market, Cork\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Glenstal Abbey is a Benedictine monastery of the Congregation of the Annunciation located in Murroe, County Limerick, Ireland. It is dedicated to Saint Joseph and Saint Columba. The current abbot of the monastery is Brendan Coffey.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe abbey is located in and beside Glenstal Castle, a Normanesque castle built by the Barrington family. The transfer from the Barrington family to the Benedictine order did not go smoothly due to unforeseen circumstances. In 1925, it was James Ryan, a wealthy priest who actually bought the place from the family. The abbey came into being in 1927 when the chapter of the Abbey of Maredsous in Belgium accepted the offer of Ryan to donate the estate when the Benedictines would open a monastery there. Later that year a superior, Fr. Bernard O\u2019Dea, was appointed and the founding monks chosen. They arrived in Glenstal Abbey in May 1927.As many other religious organisations, Glenstal Abbey too was faced with allegations of child abuse. Since 1975 ten accusations against six monks were filed. In a 2014-report The National Board for Safeguarding Children (NBSC) stated that the Benedictine community handled these accusations well with proper action, including removal from monastic life and treatment.The abbey released commercial Gregorian chant albums in the late 1990s as The Monks of Glenstal Abbey, also contributing to the multi-platinum-selling Faith of our Fathers in 1996.\n\n\n== Grounds ==\nThe picturesque grounds include lakes, forests and an old walled, terraced garden which features a \"bible garden\". From 1986 Dr. Brian P. Murphy osb, worked with volunteers, restoring the gardens, he also published a book in 2004 on the history of Glenstal Abbey Gardens.  The monastery runs an all-boys boarding secondary school on its grounds, Glenstal Abbey School, home to approximately two hundred students. It also runs a 250 acre dairy farm.\n\n\n== Abbots / Priors ==\nCurrently Abbots are elected for an eight-year period. Before 1957, the superior had the title of prior. From 1927 until 1945 the prior was appointed by the parent abbey Maredsous in Belgium.\n\nPrior Bede Lebbe OSB (to 1938)\nPrior Idesbald Ryelandt OSB (1938\u20131945)\nPrior Bernard O\u2019Dea OSB (1945\u20131952)\nPrior Placid Murray OSB DD (1952\u20131957)\nAbbot Joseph Dowdall OSB (1957\u20131966)\nAbbot Agustine O'Sullivan OSB (1966\u20131980)\nAbbot Celestine Cullen OSB (1980\u20131992)\nAbbot Christopher Dillon OSB (1992\u20132008)\nAbbot Mark Patrick Hederman OSB (2008\u20132016)\nAbbot Brendan Coffey OSB (2016\u2013)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of abbeys and priories in Ireland (County Limerick)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Abbey Website\nOfficial School Website\nOfficial Murroe Community Website",

        "wiki": "Askeaton (Irish: Eas G\u00e9itine, Waterfall of G\u00e9itine, also historically spelt Askettin), is a town in County Limerick, Ireland. The town on the N69, the road between Limerick and Tralee, is built on the banks of the River Deel some 3 km upstream from the estuary of the River Shannon.\nAmong the historic structures in the town are a castle dating from 1199 and a Franciscan friary dating from 1389. The castle was abandoned to the English in 1580 \u2013 its walls blown up by the fleeing defenders \u2013 after the fall of Carrigafoyle Castle during the Desmond Rebellions. Askeaton was a constituency in the Irish House of Commons represented by two members until the dissolution of the parliament in 1801\n\n\n== Desmond Castle ==\nThe focal point of the town is the Desmond Castle, which stands in the center of the town on a rocky island on the river Deel. This noble building has protected Askeaton since 1199, when the castle and its rights were given to Hamo de Valoignes, the Justiciary of Ireland between 1197 and 1199. In the Annals of Inisfallen, William de Burgo is recorded as having been granted the castle and estates by the king of Thomand, D\u00f3nal M\u00f3r.in 1348 Maurice FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Desmond paid 40 shillings for the barony of Lystifti. The building that stands today dates from that time. The Earls of Desmond were to become a powerful presence in Munster, of whom it was proudly said that they had become 'more Irish than the Irish themselves' \u2013 they lived in the Gaelic manner, following the Brehon Laws, dressed in the Irish manner, spoke Irish, played Irish music and games, rode and hunted, and respected poets. \nThe family had generations of enmity with the MacCarthys to the south in Cork and Kerry, as well as with their bitter Anglo-Norman rivals, the Butlers, Earls of Ormond.\nThe earliest written reference to the castle is in Leabhar nanCeart, which in translation in English means The Book of Rights, compiled in the 15th century, in which the fort of Gephtine is mentioned as being reserved to the King of Cashel.\nThe Earls of Desmond, the FitzGeralds, held possession of the castle for over 200 years; it was the centre of their power, and they ruled Munster from it. The tragic Gerald FitzGerald, 15th Earl of Desmond, had a powerful stronghold at Askeaton in 1559 and so England saw him as a threat. \nThe English tried to impose a policy of surrender on the Irish lords who rebelled and fought a war of defence across Munster. Gerald, known as The Rebel Earl, was popular among his followers, but as the atrocities of the English incursion grew unbearable they gradually abandoned him. Fleeing with a few retainers, on 11 November 1583 he was murdered by Moriarty of Castledrum, at Glenagenty, five miles east of Tralee at B\u00f3thar an Iarlaigh.Sir Nicholas Malby unsuccessfully attacked the castle in 1579. Askeaton Castle was then occupied by Lieutenant Patrick Purcell of the confederate Catholics. The English saw Askeaton as a threat while it was under Catholic rule. It was destroyed by the Cromwellian captain Daniel Axtell in 1652; he hanged Patrick Purcell. (Executions seem to have been a theme in the life of Axtell; captain of the Parliamentary Guard at the trial of King Charles I at Westminster Hall in 1649, shortly after the Restoration in 1660 he himself was hanged, drawn and quartered as a regicide.)\nThe murderous Lord Justice Sir William Pelham then took possession. It was the end of the FitzGerald reign over Askeaton and Munster.\nThe castle was transferred to the ownership of the English crown under Captain Edward Berkley.\n\n\n== Franciscan Friary ==\n\nGerald FitzGerald, 3rd Earl of Desmond, the legendary poet earl who is said still to sleep in a cave waiting to ride back on his silver-shod steed in Ireland's time of ultimate need, founded Askeaton Abbey in about 1389. It has cloisters with 12 arches on each side, an east window, mediaeval carvings, and a chapter room that is the final resting place of the martyrs Bishop Patrick O'Healy and Fr Conn O'Rourke.\nOn 9 October 1579, after failing to take Askeaton Castle, the English commander Sir Nicholas Malby attacked the town and burned the friary, killing most of the friars, some in a gruesome fashion, and wrecked the ancestral tombs of the Desmonds, in a mean-spirited attack to take revenge on the earl in his impenetrable fortress. Monks returned to the friary only in 1627 but the community did not reach its former numbers until 1642. The community again abandoned the site in 1648 when Cromwell's forces neared Askeaton, and did not return until the 1650s. The friary permanently closed in 1740.\n\n\n== St Mary's Church ==\nThe present Catholic church was built in 1851, after the previous building near the Franciscan friary was totally destroyed by fire in 1847. It is built of local limestone and has stained glass windows. The window to the right of the transept shows the resurrection of Christ, and that on the left his ascension into heaven. In the centre of the nave are windows showing St Patrick receiving the two daughters of King Laoire, the King of Ireland, into the church, and Jesus with children, and over the main door of the church a window shows the Virgin Mary. Over the door is a statue of the Pieta.The Church of Ireland also have a church in the town,  St Mary's, with a clergyman resident in Rathkeale.\n\n\n== The Hellfire Club ==\nEast of the castle are the remains of the Hellfire Club, an almost intact redbrick building built in 1740 (the same year the monks abandoned the nearby friary).\nThis bizarre secret society was founded in Dublin in 1735 by the Earl of Rosse, first Grand Master of the Irish Freemasons. It is one of two in Ireland (the other is outside Dublin). The Hellfire Clubs, throughout Ireland and Britain, were 18th-century clubs where rich men gathered to drink, gamble, have mock crucifixions and homosexual orgies.Lurid rumours around Hellfire Clubs included visits by the devil and human sacrifice. These clubs popularised the combination of whiskey, butter and cream mulled by a red-hot poker known as \"scaltheen\". The club closed down by 1800. The fa\u00e7ade of the building collapsed in the 1990s.\n\n\n== Community hall ==\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, the community organisation Muintir na T\u00edre built a community hall for the parish. Built in a time of economic depression, it was constructed with voluntary labour of local people. It became a vital focal point in the social life of the town, used for dances and concerts and bingo. Replacing the library (which was too small) as a dance hall, it became in essence the \u201cBallroom of Romance\u201d It was used as a national school while the new building was being built in 1962/63, and also as a church when masses were held there during the refurbishments of St Mary's, the Catholic church, in 1977.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nThe railway line that passes through the now closed Askeaton railway station was built by the former Limerick and Foynes Railway Company from 1856 to 1858, with the station opening on 12 May 1857. The line between Limerick and Foynes had stations at Patrickswell, Kilgobbin, Adare, Ballingrane Junction (Rathkeale) and Askeaton. The railway line to Foynes passes north of the town, but Askeaton Railway Station was closed to passenger traffic on 4 February 1963 and freight on 2 December 1974, when the station closed.Trains for Foynes continued to pass through Askeaton until the line effectively lost all its freight services in 2000. The line is still officially open to freight traffic, but has not seen a train since the annual weedspray train visited the line in May 2002, but is expected to reopen.In an interview on Limerick's Live 95fm on 18 April 2011, Kay McGuinness, chair of Shannon Foynes Port Company, said that they were confident that the rail link could be reopened for \u20ac7 million, considerably less than Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann's quoted price of \u20ac30 million. A recent campaign by the residents of Station Road prevented Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann from removing the railway gates at the station. This has kept hopes alive that the track will be reopened to traffic\n\n\n== See also ==\nAskeaton (Parliament of Ireland constituency)\nList of towns and villages in Ireland\nKilleen Cowpark, located 5 km east\n\n\n== External links ==\nInformation on the friary\nAskeaton community web-site\nDesmond Castle entry in thestandingstone.ie\nAskeaton Ballysteen Parish\n\n\n== References ==",

          "I love ruins, but this was outstanding. There are so many hidden things like functioning staircases, tombstones, open tombstones (zombies?) and a tree growing straight out of the middle of the building. Plan to spend a few hours wandering around- this is a photog's dream!",
          "The history of this friary is fascinating, but what made it superb was the tour guide, Anthony Sheehy. He gave us a detailed tour of the friary and its history of specific areas. He also shared personal stories, poetry and played the harmonica. What was meant to be a 30 minute",
          "This is a short drive from Adare and well worth it. The ruins are beautiful. I was only able to stay a few minutes since I had a ferry to catch, but quite lovely if you are into beautiful Irish ruins (like me).",

          "Dropped into this Abbey as we were passing by and were amazed at its excellent state of preservation and care. The upstanding cloister alone is a rare sight to behold and well worth seeing in itself! As we were about to leave, we were met at the door by local tour guide Anthony",

          "This is a nice friary and the cloister is a gem. It's almost complete and what is amazing is the carving of the figure of St. Francis of Assisi on one of the pillars. The silence was the only sound we heard during the visit.",
          "During our travels from Adare to Dingle, we jogged north to Askeaton. There is a castle ruin there, which is only open on weekends. But we happened into the tour office and ran into the unofficial mayor and official tour guide of Askeaton, who showed us around the equally",
          "The Friary is open to the public and its free to look around and take photos, it is really a fantastic building, the cloisters are just something to been seen. I cannot say enough of good things about this building and the town of Askeaton",
          "Not a lot of tour companies will include a stop in Askeaton. As a town, it's a little out of the way, rather small and does not host a large collection of attractions. This is why I purposely sought it out. No crowds, no noise, just you and history. About half of the Friary",
          "well worth a trip , take your time and bring a picnic and soak up the lovely atmosphere",
          "While seemingly \"off the beaten path\" the Askeaton Friary was a wonderfully preserved piece of Celtic heritage. The Askeaton Friary was founded by Gerald, 4th Earl of Desmond, about 1400AD. Much of the present building dates from 1420-1440AD and had been preserved quite well.",

        "wiki": "Glenstal Abbey is a Benedictine monastery of the Congregation of the Annunciation located in Murroe, County Limerick, Ireland. It is dedicated to Saint Joseph and Saint Columba. The current abbot of the monastery is Brendan Coffey.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe abbey is located in and beside Glenstal Castle, a Normanesque castle built by the Barrington family. The transfer from the Barrington family to the Benedictine order did not go smoothly due to unforeseen circumstances. In 1925, it was James Ryan, a wealthy priest who actually bought the place from the family. The abbey came into being in 1927 when the chapter of the Abbey of Maredsous in Belgium accepted the offer of Ryan to donate the estate when the Benedictines would open a monastery there. Later that year a superior, Fr. Bernard O\u2019Dea, was appointed and the founding monks chosen. They arrived in Glenstal Abbey in May 1927.As many other religious organisations, Glenstal Abbey too was faced with allegations of child abuse. Since 1975 ten accusations against six monks were filed. In a 2014-report The National Board for Safeguarding Children (NBSC) stated that the Benedictine community handled these accusations well with proper action, including removal from monastic life and treatment.The abbey released commercial Gregorian chant albums in the late 1990s as The Monks of Glenstal Abbey, also contributing to the multi-platinum-selling Faith of our Fathers in 1996.\n\n\n== Grounds ==\nThe picturesque grounds include lakes, forests and an old walled, terraced garden which features a \"bible garden\". From 1986 Dr. Brian P. Murphy osb, worked with volunteers, restoring the gardens, he also published a book in 2004 on the history of Glenstal Abbey Gardens.  The monastery runs an all-boys boarding secondary school on its grounds, Glenstal Abbey School, home to approximately two hundred students. It also runs a 250 acre dairy farm.\n\n\n== Abbots / Priors ==\nCurrently Abbots are elected for an eight-year period. Before 1957, the superior had the title of prior. From 1927 until 1945 the prior was appointed by the parent abbey Maredsous in Belgium.\n\nPrior Bede Lebbe OSB (to 1938)\nPrior Idesbald Ryelandt OSB (1938\u20131945)\nPrior Bernard O\u2019Dea OSB (1945\u20131952)\nPrior Placid Murray OSB DD (1952\u20131957)\nAbbot Joseph Dowdall OSB (1957\u20131966)\nAbbot Agustine O'Sullivan OSB (1966\u20131980)\nAbbot Celestine Cullen OSB (1980\u20131992)\nAbbot Christopher Dillon OSB (1992\u20132008)\nAbbot Mark Patrick Hederman OSB (2008\u20132016)\nAbbot Brendan Coffey OSB (2016\u2013)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of abbeys and priories in Ireland (County Limerick)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Abbey Website\nOfficial School Website\nOfficial Murroe Community Website",

Limerick City and County Council is the local authority for the city.\n\n\n== Geography and political subdivisions ==\nAt the 2016 census, the Metropolitan District of Limerick had a population of 104,952. On 1 June 2014 following the merger of Limerick City and County Council, a new Metropolitan District of Limerick was formed within the united council, which extended the city area. The Metropolitan District includes the city urban area and extends outwards towards Patrickswell in the west and Castleconnell in the east. The City Metropolitan Area however excludes city suburbs located within County Clare.\nLimerick is one of the constituent cities of the Cork\u2013Limerick\u2013Galway corridor, which has a population of 1 million people. It is located at a strategic position on the River Shannon with four main crossing points near the city centre. To the south of the city is the Golden Vale, an area of rich pastureland. Historically, much of the city's industry was based on this rich agricultural hinterland, and it is particularly noted for Limerick ham.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient and medieval history ===\nLuimneach originally referred to the general area along the banks of the Shannon Estuary known as Loch Luimnigh. The earliest settlement in the city, Inis Sibhtonn, was the original name for King's Island during the pre-Viking and Viking eras. This island was also called Inis an Ghaill Duibh, 'The Dark-(haired) Foreigner's Island'. The name is recorded in Viking sources as Hlymrekr.\nThe city dates from 812; however, history suggests the presence of earlier settlements in the area surrounding King's Island, the island at the historical city centre. Antiquity's map-maker, Ptolemy, produced in 150 the earliest map of Ireland, showing a place called Regia at the same site as King's Island. History also records an important battle involving Cormac mac Airt in 221 and a visit by Saint Patrick in 434 to baptise an E\u00f3ganachta king, Carthann the Fair. Saint Munchin, the first bishop of Limerick died in 652, indicating the city was a place of some note. In 812 the Vikings sailed up the Shannon and pillaged the city, burned the monastery of Mungret but were forced to flee when the Irish attacked and killed many of their number. The Normans redesigned the city in the 12th century and added much of the most notable architecture, such as King John's Castle and St Mary's Cathedral.In early medieval times Limerick was at the centre of the Kingdom of Thomond which corresponds to the present day County Clare, the Kingdom also included North Kerry and parts of South Offaly. One of the kingdom's most notable kings was Brian Boru, ancestor of the O'Brien Clan of Dalcassians. The word Thomond is synonymous with the region and is retained in place names such as Thomondgate, Thomond Bridge and Thomond Park.\n\n\n=== Late Renaissance/Early modern history ===\n\nLimerick in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was often called the most beautiful city in Ireland. The English-born judge Luke Gernon, a resident of Limerick, wrote in 1620 that at his first sight of the city he had been amazed at its magnificence: \"lofty buildings of marble, like the Colleges in Oxford\".During the civil wars of the 17th century the city played a pivotal role, besieged by Oliver Cromwell in 1651 and twice by the Williamites in the 1690s. The Treaty of Limerick ended the Williamite war in Ireland which was fought between supporters of the Catholic King James II (Jacobites) and the Protestant King William of Orange (Williamites). The treaty offered toleration to Catholicism and full legal rights to Catholics that swore an oath of loyalty to William III and Mary II. The Treaty was of national significance as it ensured closer British and Protestant dominance over Ireland. The articles of the Treaty protecting Catholic rights were not passed by the Protestant Irish Parliament which rather updated the Penal Laws against Catholics which had major implications for Irish history. Reputedly the Treaty was signed on the Treaty Stone, an irregular block of limestone which once served as a mounting block for horses. This stone is now displayed on a pedestal at Clancy Strand. Because of the treaty, Limerick is sometimes known as the Treaty City. This turbulent period earned the city its motto: urbs antiqua fuit studisque asperrima belli (an ancient city well studied in the arts of war).\nThe peaceful times that followed the turmoil of the late 17th century allowed the city to prosper through trade in the late 18th century. During this time Limerick Port established itself as one of Ireland's major commercial ports exporting agricultural produce from one of Ireland's most fertile areas, the Golden Vale, to Britain and America. This increase in trade and wealth, particularly amongst the city's merchant classes saw a rapid expansion of the city as Georgian Limerick began to take shape. This gave the city its present-day look including the extensive terraced streets of Georgian townhouses which remain in the city centre today. The Waterford and Limerick Railway linked the city to the Dublin\u2013Cork railway line in 1848 and to Waterford in 1853. The opening of a number of secondary railways in the subsequent decades developed Limerick as a regional centre of communications.  However, the economic downturn in the European conflicts of the French Revolution and Napoleonic eras, and following the Act of Union 1800, and the impact of the Great Irish Famine of 1848 caused much of the 19th century to be a more troubled period.\n\n\n=== 20th-century history ===\n\nThe Limerick boycott was an economic boycott waged against the small Jewish community for over two years in the first decade of the 20th century. It was accompanied by a number of assaults, stone throwing and intimidation, which caused many Jews to leave the city. It was instigated in 1904 by a Redemptorist priest, Father John Creagh.\nDuring the Irish War of Independence, the Limerick Soviet was a self-declared soviet that existed from 15 to 27 April 1919. A general strike was organised by the Limerick Trades and Labour Council, as a protest against the British Army's declaration of a \"Special Military Area\" under the Defence of the Realm Act, which covered most of Limerick city and a part of the county. During the strike a special strike committee was set up to print their own money, control food prices and publish newspapers.\nBy the mid-20th century, Limerick was characterised by economic stagnation and decline as many traditional industries closed or left the city. However, there were some success stories. In 1942 Shannon Airport (located in County Clare, 20 km west of the city) opened for the first time offering transatlantic flights. In 1959, Shannon Airport enabled the opening of the Shannon Free Zone which attracted a large number of multinational companies to the region. A long campaign for a third level educational institute to be located in the city finally bore fruit with the establishment of NIHE Limerick in 1969 which eventually became the University of Limerick in 1989.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nThe local government area of Limerick city is under the jurisdiction of Limerick City and County Council. The Council has responsibility for local services such as sanitation, planning and development, libraries, collection of motor taxation, local roads and social housing in the city. The council comprises elected ward Councillors with an appointed full-time CEO as the city (and county) manager. Local elections are held every five years and the Councillors annually elect a Cathaoirleach or chairman to chair the council. As of 2015, the Cathaoirleach was Cllr Liam Galvin from the Newcastle West electoral area. The 21 Councillors from the 3 electoral districts in the City Metropolitan Area also elect a mayor to represent the city. The Mayoral position is largely ceremonial and has much reduced responsibility following the merger of the Limerick local authorities. Although the Mayor is the city's first citizen, within the council the position is below that of the Cathaoirleach. The current mayor is Councillor Jerry O'Dea. Former well-known mayors include TDs Donogh O'Malley, Stephen Coughlan, Michael Lipper, Jim Kemmy and Jan O'Sullivan.Throughout most of the city's history; from 1197 when it gained its first charter, Limerick City had its own local government authority, Limerick Corporation later known as Limerick City Council. The council was one of the oldest in Ireland and was only exceeded in age by Dublin City Council. In October 2012 the Government of Ireland published Putting People First- Action Programme for Effective Local Government which set out Government policy for reforms across all the main areas of local government in Ireland. Among the recommendations was the merging of Limerick City Council with Limerick County Council. The changes came into effect on 1 June 2014 following the implementation of the Local Government Reform Act 2014.By the 1960s onwards the city had outgrown its boundary considerably; the city boundary was only altered slightly and never reflected the overall urban area of the city. A limited boundary extension on the city's north side in 2008 enlarged the city boundary by 1,020 hectares increasing the city's area by almost 50% and raising the population by an estimated 7,000. The previous boundary, encompassing 2,086 hectares, was delineated in 1950. Newer suburban districts such as Dooradoyle, Castletroy \u2013 including the University, Gouldavoher, and Raheen were continually administered to by Limerick County Council until the merger of the two authorities in June 2014. This local government structure in Limerick caused a number of inefficiencies, most notably in the area of planning. A number of suburbs such as Westbury and Parteen to the north of the city are governed by Clare County Council.\nFollowing the merger of the two authorities in 2014 a new Metropolitan District of Limerick City was set up that included the city urban area and also settlements close to the city such as Patrickswell and Castleconnell. The Metropolitan district returns 21 Councillors to Limerick City and County Council which in total has 40 Councillors returned from across Limerick City and County. The Limerick City Metropolitan District is divided into 3 wards or electoral areas which are; Limerick City East, Limerick City North and Limerick City South which elect eight, six and seven Councillors respectively.Following the 2019 local elections, Fine Gael was the largest party on the united authority with 13 seats followed by Fianna F\u00e1il with 12, Labour with 3, Sinn F\u00e9in and the Green Party (Ireland) with 2 each, the Social Democrats with 1 seat, and Independents and other parties the remaining 6 seats.For national D\u00e1il elections Limerick City is in the Limerick City constituency. From 2011, the constituency boundaries changed in accordance with the proposals of the Constituency Commission and the subsequent Electoral (Amendment) Act 2009. This changed the electoral boundaries from Limerick East and Limerick West to Limerick City and Limerick. Limerick city encompasses the city, the suburban areas of Castletroy and as far east as Castleconnell. It also includes part of south County Clare. The Limerick county constituency takes in most of the rest of the county. For European parliament elections Limerick is in South Ireland.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nLimerick's climate is classified as temperate oceanic (K\u00f6ppen Cfb). Met \u00c9ireann maintains a climatological weather station at Shannon Airport, 20 kilometres west of the city in County Clare. Shannon Airport records an average of 977 millimetres of precipitation annually, most of which is rain. Limerick has a mild climate, with the average daily maximum in July of 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) and the average daily minimum in January of 3 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F). The highest temperature recorded was 32.0 \u00b0C (89.6 \u00b0F) in June 2018, and the lowest \u221211.4 \u00b0C (11.5 \u00b0F) in 2010. Limerick is the cloudiest city in the state, averaging only 1,295 sunshine hours annually, 3.5 hours of sunshine every day. There are on average 62 days of no recordable sunshine, 6 days of thunder, 22 days of hail and 11 days of snow per year. Shannon Airport is located by the ocean at an elevation of 14 metres, so snow is less common at the station than in the city itself.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn 2014, Limerick became Ireland's inaugural National City of Culture, with a variety of artistic and cultural events occurring at locations around the city throughout the year.\nThe Limerick City Gallery of Art on Pery Square is the city's chief venue for contemporary art exhibitions. It is home to a permanent collection of Irish art, which shows works from the early 18th to 20th century. The gallery houses the National Collection of Contemporary Drawing founded by the artist Samuel Walsh in 1987. Limerick's major contemporary art event is EVA International, Ireland's Biennial of Contemporary Art. EVA International, centered mainly in the Limerick City Gallery of Art, is curated by varying guest curators and includes contemporary artworks by both international and Irish artists.The Lime Tree Theatre officially opened at the Mary Immaculate College campus in October 2012. The venue hosts theatre, music, comedy, traditional arts, schools' performances and conferences.The Belltable Arts Centre on O'Connell Street hosts local playwrights and drama productions. The University Concert Hall located in UL is a 1,000 seat venue and provides a large venue for national and international acts to visit the city. Limerick is also the home of street theatre companies, including \"The Umbrella Project\".\nLimerick's literature scene is supported by projects like the Limerick Writers' Centre, which was established in 2008 and runs a range of writing activities in the city. Limerick natives include Pulitzer Prize winning author, Frank McCourt; novelists Kate O'Brien, Michael Curtin, Kevin Barry and Donal Ryan. Poets from Limerick include Michael Hogan, Desmond O'Grady, and John Liddy.Other Limerick arts groups include Contact Studios, which provides individual studio spaces for visual artists; the Daghdha Dance Company, a contemporary dance company that has adopted a renovated church in John's Square, adjacent to St John's Cathedral, as a performance space); the Fresh Film Festival, which is held each spring, and includes films made by young people (7\u201318 years); Impact Theatre Company; and Limerick Printmakers Studio and Gallery, which provides printmaking facilities, a venue for exhibitions and events and an education programme. The Limerick Youth Theatre provides young people with an opening into acting and production.The Irish Chamber Orchestra and the Irish World Music Centre are both based in the University of Limerick. The university has a thousand-seat state-of-the-art concert hall that hosts visiting performers. The city's music scene has produced bands such as The Cranberries, guitarist Noel Hogan's MonoBand, The Hitchers and others. Electronic musician Richard D. James, more commonly known as Aphex Twin, was born in Limerick in 1971. The Limerick Art Gallery and the Art College cater for painting, sculpture and performance art.\nLimerick is also home to comedians The Rubberbandits, D'Unbelievables (Pat Shortt and Jon Kenny) and Karl Spain. Dolan's Warehouse on the Dock Road is a venue specialising in live music, established in 1998. Baker Place was a nightclub that held mainly local underground nights until its closure in 2011. In 2020, it was announced that the Dromkeen-based Shiloh Trust was seeking planning permission to convert the former premises of Baker Place into a bible school. The Crush 87 nightclub (formerly known as Trinity Rooms until its closure in 2010), was relaunched in 2013.The city is the setting for Frank McCourt's memoir Angela's Ashes and the film adaptation. The Frank McCourt Museum situated in Frank's former school on Hartsonge Street opened in 2011 and contains artefacts from the book. Limerick has also been the setting or location for a number of other films, including the dramas The Real Thing (2002), Cowboys & Angels (2003) and Lost & Found (2015).Riverfest is a summer festival held annually in Limerick since 2004. The 2014 festival was held in May and had a record 80,000 visitors.\n\n\n== Humorous verse ==\nA limerick is a type of humorous verse of five lines with an AABBA rhyme scheme: the poem's connection with the city is obscure, but the name is generally taken to be a reference to Limerick city or County Limerick, sometimes particularly to the Maigue Poets, and may derive from an earlier form of nonsense verse parlour game that traditionally included a refrain that included \"Will [or won't] you come (up) to Limerick?\" The earliest known use of the name \"Limerick\" for this type poem is an 1880 reference, in a Saint John, New Brunswick newspaper, to an apparently well-known tune.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Broadcasting ===\nRT\u00c9 lyric fm, a state-run classical music radio station and part of RT\u00c9, broadcasts nationally from studios in the city centre on Cornmarket Square which opened in 1994. Limerick's local radio station is Live 95FM, broadcasting from 'Radio House', near the waterfront at Steamboat Quay. Spin South West, owned by Communicorp, broadcasts to Counties Kerry, Clare, Limerick, Tipperary and southwest Laois from its studios at Landmark Buildings in the Raheen Industrial Estate. Student radio station, Wired FM, broadcasts on 99.9FM from Mary Immaculate College. Wired FM also has studios in Limerick Institute of Technology. University Hospital Limerick has a radio station on 94.2FM, but this can be heard only in the hospital and surrounding area. West Limerick 102 is broadcast from Newcastle West. The national broadcaster, RT\u00c9, has radio and television studios in the city, which are periodically used to broadcast programming from Limerick.\n\n\n=== Print ===\nSeveral local newspapers are published in the city, including The Limerick Post and The Limerick Leader and magazines include the Limerick Event Guide, Business Limerick and Limerick Now.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\nLimerick city is approximately 25 km from Shannon Airport. Tourist attractions in the city centre include Limerick City Museum, King John's Castle (1210), St Mary's Cathedral (1168), the Hunt Museum, the University of Limerick, Georgian houses and gardens and the Treaty Stone.  There are several seasonal tours, including Angela's Ashes walking tour of Limerick City, historical walking tour, and boat tours along the River Shannon.\nThe city centre is divided between the traditional areas of \"English Town\" on the southern end of King's Island, which includes the King John's Castle; \"Irish Town\", which includes the older streets on the south bank; and the current economic centre further south, called \"Newtown Pery\". Newtown Pery was built in the late 18th century before the Act of Union and, unusually for an Irish city and unique in Limerick, is laid out on a grid plan. The Limerick City Museum (formerly aka the Jim Kemmy Municipal Museum), is located in Istabraq Hall, City Hall, Merchant's Quay. It contains displays on Limerick's history and manufactures.\n\nThe Georgian core of the city, with its Georgian architecture in the Newtown Pery, was developed from the mid 18th century. This core includes O'Connell Street (George Street before independence) from the Cecil Street intersection running to the south west end of the Crescent, and south-east to Pery Street including Glentworth Street and Barrington Street. Other buildings of architectural note in the city are St John's Cathedral, designed by the notable Victorian architect, Philip Charles Hardwick. St Mary's Cathedral, at over 800 years old, is one of the oldest in Ireland. St John's Cathedral, whilst more modern, has Ireland's tallest spire at 94 m (308 ft).\nThe Hunt Museum is based in the historic 18th-century former Custom House. The museum was established to house a collection of approximately 2000 works of art and antiquities formed by John and Gertrude Hunt during their lifetimes.\nThe main park in Limerick is the People's Park which was opened in 1877 in memory of Richard Russell, a prominent local business man. The park is dominated by the Thomas Spring Rice memorial (MP for the city 1820\u20131832) and has a large collection of mature deciduous and evergreen trees.\nLimerick city centre changed significantly with the construction of several modern high-rise buildings in the early 2000s, in particular as part of the regeneration of the former docks area along the Dock Road. The suburban areas, where the majority of the population now live, have grown out from the centre along the main roads to Ennis (North Circular and Ennis Road areas/Caherdavin), Dublin (Castletroy and the University) and Cork (Ballinacurra/Dooradoyle/Raheen). Suburban houses are generally two-floor semi-detached homes for single families. These were built from the 1950s onwards in large estates by government projects and commercial developments, although there are many examples of Edwardian and older 1930s suburban homes on the main suburban thoroughfares leading towards the city (North & South Circular, Ballinacurra Road, O'Connell Avenue).\n\nLimerick city's nightlife is supported by a number of nightclubs and pubs which offer music. For example, Dolan's Warehouse is a small music venue which hosts local, national and international folk, indie, jazz, rock and traditional Irish music acts.In County Limerick, Adare village and the Foynes Flying Boat Museum, approximately 35 km (22 miles/30 minutes) from Limerick City along the scenic coastal N69 route from Limerick to Tralee, are also attractions. Bunratty Castle in County Clare is another local attraction, and is situated 15.4 km north of the city. Limerick is known to be the antipodes to the Campbell Islands of New Zealand.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nLimerick is the third largest city in Ireland (after Dublin and Cork) with a population of 94,192 in the urban area and 104,952 in the metropolitan district, according to the 2016 CSO census. The past census reported a large population decline in central city areas due in part to the Limerick regeneration process where in these areas the largest reduction was reported nationally and also to outward migration following the collapse of the local and national economy from 2008 onwards. The population of the Limerick Larger Urban Zone as defined by the EU is 162,413. The ethnic diversity in Limerick's population, which includes a large immigrant community, saw rapid growth during the Celtic Tiger and the following decade. The Polish community is one of the largest demographic groups in the Municipal District, with approximately 4,000 living and working in the area. Ireland's first Polish bank opened in 2007. The African community has set up a number of churches, which are now part of the cultural makeup of the city.Limerick has a large stock of local authority housing. Prior to the merger of Limerick City and County Council 41% of all housing within the old Limerick City Council boundary was local authority, which was the highest in Ireland. This figure is however no longer accurate given the larger metropolitan district of the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nLimerick is in the region dubbed \"the Midwest\". Also known as the \"Shannon Region\", this is primarily an economic and social concept. The region encompasses County Limerick, County Clare, North County Tipperary, Northwest County Kerry and south County Offaly, with its focal point centred on Limerick and its environs within an 8-kilometre (5 mi) radius.\nThe area is the main economic region in Ireland outside Dublin and Cork. Its economic development has been driven in part by the University of Limerick, Limerick Institute of Technology, Shannon Airport in County Clare and Shannon Development (an economic development agency), whose precursor was SFADCO (Shannon Free Airport Development Company), an economic agency that provided tax incentives to companies locating in the area surrounding Shannon Airport. As of 2006 Shannon Development was mostly concerned with disposing of valuable industrial park properties. Limerick Chamber of Commerce, a representative body for businesses in the region, celebrated its bicentennial/bicentenary in 2015.\nHistorically Limerick was an agricultural commodity-driven economy, due to its position as the first major port along the River Shannon. By the middle of the 18th century, Limerick Port grew to become one of Ireland's principal commercial ports, exporting agricultural produce from the most fertile tracts in Ireland known as the Golden Vale as well as produce from the surrounding counties. The city was one of the main meat processing areas in Ireland, and industry included confectionery and flour production. The city was known for its bacon industry \u2013 however this went into decline in the mid-20th century. The fishing industry in Limerick, based on Clancy's Strand opposite King John's Castle and at Coonagh nearby, once employed hundreds of men. The boat most commonly used was the Gandelow which was also used as a small Lighter (barge) to ferry goods to and from larger ships in the port. In the 1920s the construction of a dam at Ardnacrusha severely impacted salmon breeding and that, and the introduction of quotas, had by the 1950s caused salmon fishing to diminish. By 2006, most fishermen had relinquished their drift net licences and the industry can now be said to be dormant.As with other cities in Ireland, a number of multinational companies are based in Limerick, and the city is a growing recipient of foreign direct investment. Dell had its main European Manufacturing Facility at the Raheen Business Park however in January 2009 Dell announced that it would close its Limerick computer manufacturing plant and move the production lines to Poland. The facility was the largest Dell manufacturing plant outside the United States and produced 30,000\u201360,000 units per day for export to the EMEA. Dell remains one of the largest employers in the mid-west with over 1,000 people employed in service and support. Analog Devices has its European manufacturing base in Raheen, 3 km south-west of the city centre. The site employs more than 1,000 people. Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Vistakon (the world's largest manufacturer of contact lenses) has a large facility in Castletroy in the National Technology Park and also employs close to 1,000 people. It is Vistakon's only production facility outside the United States and one of the largest contact-lens manufacturing plants in the world. Cook Medical, the world's largest privately owned Medical Devices company, employs over 800 people in Limerick at the National Technology Park.\nThe Post-2008 Irish economic downturn had a profound effect on Limerick. The announcement in 2009 that Dell was to move its manufacturing facility from Limerick to Poland devastated the local economy. 1,900 jobs were lost at Dell and it is believed that for every job that was lost at Dell at least another 4 to 5 were at risk. The closure of the Dell manufacturing facility amounted to 2% of Ireland's national GDP. The downturn in the construction industry also cost many jobs as did the stalled Limerick regeneration programme which promised investment in Limerick's deprived city areas. As of 2012 unemployment had become a major problem across the city with the unemployment rate in the city at 28.6% which was almost twice the national average.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nThe Crescent Shopping Centre is the largest shopping centre in Ireland, outside of Dublin, and the largest in the province of Munster. It is located in Dooradoyle about 3 km south of the city centre, and has over 90 shopping outlets along with restaurants and a 12-screen Omniplex Cinema. The city centre also has a large retail district which includes a mix of more traditional type of shops as well as some modern high street stores. Cruises Street is one of the main shopping streets. O'Connell Street, William Street, Bedford Row and Thomas Street) are also retail streets within the city. The city centre saw some works on remodelling in the early 21st century, with pedestrianisation works on Bedford Row, Thomas Street and parts of Catherine Street, as well as widening footpaths on William Street. These works have sought to address a reduction of footfall in the city centre (in turn influencing the closure of many city centre retail businesses) which occurred from the recession of 2008 onwards.\n\n\n==== Retail parks and shopping centres ====\n\nDuring the Celtic Tiger years a number of shopping centres and retail parks opened in suburban areas of Limerick. In addition to the Crescent Shopping Centre, which expanded in the early 2000s, the Jetland Shopping Centre opened in Caherdavin in 2005. The Childers Road Retail Park and the Parkway Shopping Centre in the east of the city also have a number of high street stores. Unfinished retail centres include the Coonagh Cross retail development and the Parkway Valley Shopping Centre on the Dublin Road. A proposed but unapproved retail development project, the Opera Centre, makes up part of the \"Limerick 2030\" scheme.\n\n\n==== The Milk Market ====\nThe Milk Market located at Cornmarket Row in the city centre sells locally produced foods and products and is governed by Limerick Market Trustees. In 2010 work was undertaken to redevelop the existing premises to an all-weather, all year round facility as it operated in an outdoor environment. The work involved constructing a large canopy over the existing market premises and was officially re-opened in June 2010. The Milk Market Project won the 2011 Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI) 'Peoples Choice Award'.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nIn 2013, a renewable energy strategy was launched for the region, and proposed a 20% reduction in CO2-emissions, while ensuring that short-term actions were beneficial to the long-term goal of 100% renewable energy. The strategy was completed by the Danish Aalborg University.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\nShannon Airport is 20 km west of the city in County Clare. It is one of Ireland's main airports and is easily accessible from Limerick via the N18 dual carriageway and from other regions via the Limerick Tunnel. It has scheduled flights to European and North American destinations. Airlines using the airport include Ryanair, Aer Lingus, United Airlines, American Airlines, Aer Lingus Regional and Delta Air Lines. There is no rail link to the airport. Coonagh airfield, a few kilometres west of Caherdavin, serves small private aircraft. Kerry and Cork Airports are around 1 hour 30 minutes and 2 hours drive away, respectively. Kerry Airport is connected to Farranfore railway station, from Limerick railway station travel via Limerick Junction and Mallow.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nLocal public transport is provided by several companies. Bus \u00c9ireann, Ireland's state-owned bus company, operates a number of services subsidised by the National Transport Authority, while a number of provide operators also run commercial bus services in and around Limerick. An updated city bus network was introduced in Limerick City in December 2016, which introduced new routes. In May 2019, Bus \u00c9ireann further changed and improved the Limerick City timetable, including increased frequency and later operating times.\nOther rural buses run to towns and villages in the county and to Shannon Airport. There are also a number of Intercity and international buses from Bus \u00c9ireann's bus terminal adjoining Limerick Colbert railway station. These include hourly services to Dublin, Cork, Ennis and Galway. Bus \u00c9ireann have also commenced a Limerick to Galway Express service travelling on the M18 in addition to the regular service. Buses run every 2 hours to Tralee and Killarney. There are also regular daily services to Waterford and Athlone, and a daily service to London via the ferry from Rosslare Europort.\nThere are a number of private bus companies in operation providing city and intercity services. Dublin Coach provide the M7 express service which operates every hour from Arthur's Quay which goes to Dublin or Ennis. JJ Kavanagh also provide Dublin to Limerick services from Arthur's Quay. Citylink run a number of services from Limerick to Galway and Cork and operate from Henry Street.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nIarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann's Limerick Colbert station is the railway hub for the city and the Mid West Region with a number of intercity and commuter rail services. Limerick railway station opened on 28 August 1858, replacing an earlier, temporary station 500 m east, which had operated from 9 May 1848.The following inter city routes are available from Limerick Colbert station :\n\nLimerick to Dublin Heuston: 16 services daily including 4 direct services. All remaining Dublin \u2013 Limerick services require passengers to change to the Dublin to Cork train at either Limerick Junction or at Ballybrophy railway station.\nLimerick to Waterford: 2 services daily (but none on Sundays). Passengers must change train at Limerick Junction to continue to Waterford with stations at Tipperary, Cahir, Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir.\nLimerick to Galway: 5 services daily.

The M7 (Dublin), N/M18 (Galway, Ennis, Shannon), N/M20 (Cork), N21 (Tralee) and N24 (Waterford) routes all start/terminate in or near the city. Road infrastructure is further supplemented by the southern ring road and Limerick Tunnel bypass of the city and the M20 bypass of Dooradoyle and Raheen to the south of the city. Connections to the other cities were improved with the completion of the M7 motorway in December 2010, and continuing upgrades ongoing to the N/M18 to Shannon, Ennis, Galway and Tuam \u2013 the final section opened in September 2017. A motorway is also planned between Cork and Limerick, with a proposed completion date in the mid 2020s.\n\n\n=== Waterway transport ===\nHistorically, waterway transport has been key to Limerick's development. Vikings established the city as a maritime trading port. The city's position on a major Irish river system, the Shannon, enabled transport to the midlands of Ireland and further north and west. By the 18th century with the opening of canal systems throughout Ireland, Limerick Port established itself as Ireland's premier commercial port on the western side of the country. This was enabled by ease of access from the facilitated by the opening of canals but most importantly to the River Shannon. The opening of the Grand Canal in the 18th century provided further access to Dublin and the east of the country. There are also a number of disused canals in the vicinity of the city including the Park Canal & the Passey \u2013 Errina Canal on the old Limerick navigation. Waterway transport on the Shannon was regularly used to transport goods from Limerick to Dublin and vice versa however this mode of transport fell into decline in the 20th century. Originally Limerick port was located near the confluence of the Abbey and Shannon rivers at King's Island. Today the Shannon Foynes Port is located further downstream on the Shannon alongside the Dock Road. This general purpose facility port is operated by the Shannon Foynes Port Company who operate all marine activities in the Shannon estuary.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nLimerick is a centre of higher education in the region, and technical and continuation education within the city traces its beginning back to the formation of the Limerick Athenaeum Society in 1852, marking the foundation of the Limerick Institute of Technology.

          "A very disappointing experience. We paid 21 euro for 2 adults and 2 children. We were in and out in about 15 minutes. Coaches and cars were coming and going all the time. It certainly was not worth what we paid for it. Stop and get photos but don't bother wasting your time going",

          "I already posted about the castle , but the Folk Park is nice. They show you how they do the thatching for the roofs of houses. Also, what I loved most was the O\u2019Neill Pottery Shoppe, where I bought a necklace. Wish I had a way to get ahold of them to buy more.",
          "The castle is amazing and the actors/singers/waiters are marvellous in staying in character. Quibble: it\u2019s billed as medieval but there were some serious anachronistic issues with music and dress! Pipe major was Scots not Irish! But the food was good and the audience loved it.",
          "At nearly 17 Euros to get in here I was hoping for something awesome, and in all fairness it wasn't far off. There is so much to see here...from the castle itself with its many intricate passages and rooms...fantastic views from the turrets and a couple of actors dressed up",

        "wiki": "Thomas Moore (28 May 1779 \u2013 25 February 1852) was an Irish writer, poet and lyricist celebrated for his Irish Melodies. Their setting of English-Language verse to old Irish tunes marked the transition in popular Irish culture from Gaelic to English. Politically, Moore was recognised in England as a press, or \"squib\", writer for the aristocratic Whigs; in Ireland he was accounted a Catholic patriot. Married to a Protestant actress and hailed as \"Anacreon Moore\" after the classical Greek composer of drinking songs and erotic verse, Moore made no profession of piety. But in the controversies that surrounded Catholic Emancipation he was seen to defend the tradition of the Church in Ireland against both evangelising Protestants and uncompromising lay Catholics. Longer prose works reveal more radical sympathies: a Life and Death of Lord Edward Fitzgerald, the United Irish leader depicted as a martyr in the cause of democratic reform; and, complementing Maria Edgeworth's Castle Rackrent, Memoirs of Captain Rock, a saga, not of Anglo-Irish landowners, but of their exhausted tenants driven to the semi-insurrection of \"Whiteboyism\". Today, however, Moore is remembered almost alone either for his Irish Melodies (typically \"The Minstrel Boy\" and \"The Last Rose of Summer\") or, less generously, for the role he is thought to have played in the loss of the memoirs of his friend Lord Byron.\n\n\n== Early life, and artistic launch ==\nThomas Moore was born to Anastasia Codd from Wexford and John Moore from Kerry over his parents' grocery shop in Aungier Street, Dublin, He had two younger sisters, Kate and Ellen. Moore showed an early interest in music and performance, staging musical plays with his friends and entertaining hope of being an actor. In Dublin he attended Samuel Whyte's English grammar school. Whyte had taught Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Irish playwright and English Whig politician, of whom Moore later was to write a biography.\n\n\n=== Trinity College and the United Irishmen ===\nIn 1795, Moore was among the first Catholics admitted to Trinity College, Dublin, preparing, as his mother had hoped, for a career in law. Through his friends at Trinity, Robert Emmett and Edward Hudson, Moore was connected to the popular politics of the capital agitated by the French Revolution and by the prospect of a French invasion. With their encouragement, in 1797, Moore wrote an appeal to his fellow students to resist the proposal, then being canvassed by the English-appointed Dublin Castle administration, to secure Ireland by incorporating the kingdom in a union with Great Britain. In April 1798, Moore was acquitted at Trinity on the charge of being a party, through the Society of United Irishmen, to sedition. \nMoore had not taken the United Irish oath with Emmett and Hudson, and he played no part in the republican rebellion of 1798, or in the conspiracy for which Emmett was executed in 1803. Later, in a biography of the United Irish leader Lord Edward Fitzgerald (1831), he made clear his sympathies, not hiding his regret that the French expedition under  General Hoche failed in December 1796 to effect a landing. To Emmett's sacrifice on the gallows Moore pays homage in the song  \"O, Breathe Not His Name\".\n\n\n=== London society and first success ===\nIn 1799, Moore continued his law studies at Middle Temple in London. The impecunious student was assisted by friends in the expatriate Irish community in London, including Barbara, widow of Arthur Chichester, 1st Marquess of Donegall, the landlord and borough-owner of Belfast.Moore's translations of Anacreon, celebrating wine, women and song, were published in 1800 with a dedication to the Prince of Wales. His introduction to the future Prince Regent and King, George IV was a high point in Moore's ingratiation with aristocratic and literary circles in London, a success due in great degree to his talents as a singer and songwriter. In the same year he collaborated briefly as a librettist with Michael Kelly in the comic opera, The Gypsy Prince, staged at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket,In 1801, Moore hazarded a collection of his own verse: Poetical Works of the Late Thomas Little Esq.. The pseudonym may have been advised by their juvenile eroticism. Moore's celebration of kisses and embraces skirted contemporary standards of propriety. When these tightened in the Victorian era, they were to put an end to what was a relative publishing success.\n\n\n== Travels and family ==\n\n\n=== Observations of America and duel with critic ===\nIn the hope of future advancement, Moore reluctantly sailed from London in 1803 to take up a government post secured through the favours of Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 2nd Earl of Moira (later Governor-General of India). He was to be the registrar of the Admiralty Prize Court in Bermuda. Although as late as 1925 still recalled as \"the poet laureate\" of the island, Moore found life on Bermuda sufficiently dull that after six months he appointed a deputy and left for an extended tour of North America. As in London, Moore secured high-society introductions in the United States including to the President, Thomas Jefferson. Repelled by the provincialism of the average American, Moore consorted with exiled European aristocrats, come to recover their fortunes, and with oligarchic Federalists from whom he received what he later conceded was a \"twisted and tainted\" view of the new republic.Following his return to England in 1804, Moore published Epistles, Odes, and Other Poems (1806). In addition to  complaints about America and Americans (including their defence of slavery), this catalogued Moore's real and imagined escapades with American women. Francis Jeffrey denounced the volume in the Edinburgh Review (July 1806), calling Moore \"the most licentious of modern versifiers\", a poet whose aim is \"to impose corruption upon his readers, by concealing it under the mask of refinement.\" Moore's challenged Jeffrey to a duel but their confrontation was interrupted by the police. In what seemed to be a \"pattern\" in Moore's life (\"it was possible to condemn [Moore] only if you did not know him\"), the two then became fast friends. Moore, nonetheless, was dogged by the report that the police had found that the pistol given to Jeffreys was unloaded. In his satirical English Bards and Scotch Reviewers (1809), Byron, who had himself been stung by one of Jeffrey's review, suggested Moore's weapon was also \"leadless\": \"on examination, the balls of the pistols, like the courage of the combatants, were found to have evaporated\". To Moore this was scarcely more satisfactory, and he wrote to Byron implying that unless the remarks were clarified, Byron, too, would be challenged. In the event, when Byron, who had been abroad, returned there was again reconciliation and a lasting friendship.\n\n\n=== Marriage and children ===\nBetween 1808 and 1810, Moore appeared each year in Kilkenny, Ireland, with a charitable mixed repertory of professional players and high-society amateurs. He favoured comic roles in plays like Sheridan's The Rivals and O'Keeffe's The Castle of Andalusia. Among the professionals, on stage in Kilkenny with her sister, the tragedienne-to-be Mary Ann Duff, was Elizabeth \"Bessy\" Dyke. In 1811, Moore married Bessy in St Martin-in-the-Fields, London. Together with Bessy's lack of a dowry, the Protestant ceremony may have been the reason why Moore kept the match for some time secret from his parents. Bessy shrank from fashionable society to such an extent that many of her husband's friends never met her (some of them jokingly doubted her very existence). Those who did held her in high regard.The couple first set up house in London, then in the country in Lord Moira's neighbourhood at Mayfield Cottage in Derbyshire, and finally in Sloperton Cottage in Wiltshire near the country seat of another close friend, Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne. Tom and Bessy had five children, none of whom survived them. Three girls died young, and both sons lost their lives as young men. One of them, Tom, died in some disgrace as a French Foreign Legionnaire in Algeria. Despite these heavy personal losses, the marriage is generally regarded to have been a happy one.\n\n\n=== Debt exile, last meeting with Byron ===\nIn 1818, it was discovered that the man Moore had appointed his deputy in Bermuda had embezzled 6,000 pounds sterling, a large sum for which Moore was liable. To escape debtor's prison, in September 1819, Moore left for France, travelling with Lord John Russell (future Whig prime minister and editor of Moore's journals and letters). In Venice in October, Moore saw Byron for the last time. Byron entrusted him with a manuscript for his memoirs, which, as his literary executor, Moore promised to have published after Byron's death.In Paris, Moore was joined by Bessy and the children. Once he learned the debt was partly cleared with the help of Lord Lansdowne (whom Moore repaid almost immediately by a draft on Longman, his publisher), the family, after more than a year, returned to Sloperton Cottage.\n\n\n== Political and historical writing ==\n\n\n=== Squib writer for the Whigs ===\nTo support his family Moore entered the field of political squib writing on behalf of his Whig friends and patrons. The Whigs had been split by the divided response of Edmund Burke and Charles Fox to the French Revolution. But with antics of the Prince Regent, and in particular his highly public efforts to disgrace and divorce Princess Caroline, proving a lightening for popular discontent, they were finding new unity and purpose. \nFrom the \"Whigs as Whigs\", Moore claimed not to have received \"even the semblance of a favour\" (Lord Moira, they \"hardly acknowledge as one of themselves\"). And with exceptions \"easily counted\", Moore was convinced that there was \"just as much selfishness and as much low-party spirit among them generally as the Tories\". But for Moore, the fact that the Prince Regent held fast against Catholic admission to parliament may have been reason sufficient to turn on his former friend and patron. Moore's Horatian mockery of the Prince in the pages of the Morning Chronicle were collected in Intercepted Letters, or the Two-Penny Post-Bag (1813). \n\n\n=== The lampooning of Castlereagh ===\nAnother, and possibly more personal, target for Moore was the Foreign Secretary Lord Castlereagh. A reform-minded Ulster Presbyterian turned Anglican Tory, as Irish Secretary Castlereagh had been ruthless in the suppression of the United Irishmen and in pushing the Act of Union through  the Irish Parliament. In what were the \"verbal equivalents of the political cartoons of the day\", Tom Crib's Memorial to Congress (1818) and Fables for the Holy Alliance (1823), Moore lampoons Castlereagh's deference to the reactionary interests of Britain's continental allies. Widely read, so that Moore eventually produced a sequel, was the verse novel The Fudge Family in Paris (1818). The family of an Irishman working as a propagandist for Castlereagh in Paris, the Fudges are accompanied by an accomplished tutor and classicist, Phelim Connor. An upright but disillusioned Irish Catholic, his letters to a friend reflect Moore's own views. \nConnor's regular epistolary denunciations of Castlereagh have two recurrent themes. The first is Castlereagh as \"the embodiment of the sickness with which Ireland had infected British politics as a consequence of the union\": \"We sent thee Castlereagh \u2013 as heaps of dead Have slain their slayers by the pest they spread\". The second is that at the time of the Acts of Union Castlereagh's support for Catholic emancipation had been disingenuous. Castlereagh had been master of \"that faithless craft\", which can \"cart the slave, can swear he shall be freed\", but then \"basely spurns him\" when his \"point is gain'd\".\n\n\n=== The Memoirs of Captain Rock ===\nAs a partisan squib writer, Moore played a role not dissimilar to that of Jonathan Swift a century earlier. Moore greatly admired Swift as a satirist, but charged him with caring no more for the \"misery\" of his Roman Catholic countrymen \"than his own Gulliver for the sufferings of so many disenfranchised Yahoos\". The Memoirs of Captain Rock might have been Moore's response to those who questioned whether the son of a Dublin grocer entertaining English audiences from Wiltshire was himself connected to the great mass of his countrymen \u2013 to those whose remitted rents helped sustain the great houses among which he was privileged to move.\nThe Memoirs relate the history of Ireland as told by a contemporary, the scion of a Catholic family that lost land in successive English settlements. The character, Captain Rock, is fictional but the history is in earnest.  When it catches up with the narrator in the late Penal Law era, his family has been reduced to the \"class of wretched cottiers\". Exposed to the voracious demands of spendthrift Anglo-Irish landlords (pilloried by Maria Edgeworth), both father and son assume captaincies among the \"White-boys, Oak-boys, and Hearts-of Steel\", the tenant conspiracies that attack tax collectors, terrorise the landlords' agents and violently resist evictions.This low-level agrarian warfare continued through, and beyond, the Great Irish Famine of the 1840s. It was only after this catastrophe, which as Prime Minister Moore's Whig friend, Lord Russell, failed in any practical measure to allay, that British governments began to assume responsibility for agrarian conditions. At the time of Captain Rock's publication (1824), the commanding issue of the day was not tenant rights or land reform. It was the final instalment of Catholic Emancipation: Castlereagh's unredeemed promise of Catholic admission to parliament.\n\n\n=== Letter to the Roman Catholics of Dublin ===\n\nSince within a united kingdom Irish Catholics would be reduced to a distinct minority, Castlereagh's promises of their parliamentary emancipation seemed credible at the time of the Union. But the provision was stripped out of the union bills when in England the admission of Catholics to the \"Protestant Constitution\" encountered the standard objection: that as subject to political direction from Rome, Catholics could not be entrusted with the defence of constitutional liberties. Moore rallied to the \"liberal compromise\" proposed by Henry Grattan, who had moved the enfranchisement of Catholics in the old Irish parliament. Fears of \"Popery\" were to be allayed by according the Crown a \"negative control\", a veto, on the appointment of Catholic bishops. \nIn an open Letter to the Roman Catholics of Dublin (1810), Moore noted that the Irish bishops (legally resident in Ireland only from 1782) had themselves been willing to comply with a practice otherwise universal in Europe. Conceding a temporal check of papal authority, he argued, was in Ireland's Gallican tradition. In the time of \"her native monarchy\", the Pope had had no share in the election of Irish bishops. \"Slavish notions of papal authority\" developed only in consequence of the English conquest. The native aristocracy had sought in Rome a \"spiritual alliance\" against the new \"temporal tyranny\" at home.In resisting royal assent and in placing \"their whole hierarchy at the disposal of the Roman court\", Irish Catholics would \"unnecessarily\" be acting in \"remembrance of times, which it is the interest of all parties [Catholic and Protestant, Irish and English] to forget\". Such argument made little headway against the man Moore decried as a demagogue, but who, as a result of his uncompromising stand, was to emerge as the undisputed leader of the Catholic interest in Ireland, Daniel O\u2019Connell. \nEven when, in 1814, the Curia itself (then still in silent alliance with Britain against Napoleon) proposed that bishops be \"personally acceptable to the king\", O'Connell was opposed. Better, he declared, that Irish Catholics \"remain for ever without emancipation\" rather than allow the king and his ministers \"to interfere\" with the Pope's appointment of Irish prelates. At stake was the unity of church and people. \"Licensed\" by the government, the bishops and their priests would be no more regarded than the ministers of the established Church of Ireland.When final emancipation came in 1829, the price O'Connell paid was the disenfranchisement of the Forty-shilling freeholders \u2013 those who, in the decisive protest against Catholics exclusion, defied their landlords in voting O'Connell in the 1828 Clare by-election. The \"purity\" of the Irish church was sustained. Moore lived to see the exceptional papal discretion thus confirmed reshape the Irish hierarchy culminating in 1850 with the appointment of the Rector of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith in Rome, Paul Cullen, as Primate Archbishop of Armagh.\n\n\n=== Travels of an Irish Gentleman in Search of a Religion ===\nIn a call heeded by Protestants of all denominations, in 1822 the new Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin, William Magee, declared the absolute necessity of winning an Irish majority for the Reformed faith \u2014 a \"Second Reformation\".  Carrying \"religious tracts  expressly written for the edification of the Irish peasantry\", the \"editor\" of Captain Rock's Memoirs is an English missionary in the ensuing \"bible war\". Catholics, who coalesced behind O'Connell in the Catholic Association, believed that proselytising advantage was being sought in hunger and distress (that tenancies and food were being used to secure converts), and that the usual political interests were at play.Moore's narrator in Travels of an Irish Gentleman in Search of a Religion (1833) is again fictional. He is, as Moore had been, a Catholic student at Trinity College. On news of Emancipation (passage of the 1829 Catholic Relief Bill) he exclaims: \"Thank God! I may now, if I like, turn Protestant\". Oppressed by the charge that Catholics are \"a race of obstinate and obsolete religionists [\u2026] unit for freedom\", and freed from \"the point of honour\" that would have prevented him from abandoning his church in the face of continuing sanctions, he sets out to explore the tenets of the \"true\" religion.Predictably, the resolve the young man draws from his theological studies is to remain true to the faith of his forefathers (not to exchange \"the golden armour of the old Catholic Saints\" for \"heretical brass\").. The argument, however, was not the truth of Catholic doctrine. It was the inconsistency and fallacy of the bible preachers. Moore's purpose, he was later to write, was to put \"upon record\" the \"disgust\" he felt at \"the arrogance with which most Protestant parsons assume [\u2026] credit for being the only true Christians, and the insolence with which [\u2026] they denounce all Catholics as idolators and Antichrist\". Had his young man found \"among the Orthodox of the first [Christian] ages\" one \"particle\" of their rejection of the supposed \"corruptions\" of the Roman church \u2013 justification not by by faith alone but also by good works, transubstantiation, and veneration of saints, relics and images \u2014 he would have been persuaded.Moore's own outlook has been described as \"cheerful paganism\", or, at the very least, \u00e0 la carte Catholicism favouring \"what scriptural Protestantism hated: the music, the theatricality, the symbolism, the idolatry\". Despite his mother being a devout catholic, and like O'Connell acknowledging Catholicism as Ireland's \"national faith\", Moore appears to have abandoned the formal practice of his religion as soon as he entered Trinity.\n\n\n=== Sheridan, Fitzgerald and The History of Ireland ===\nIn 1825, Moore's Memoirs of the Life of Richard Brinsley Sheridan was finally published after nine years of work on and off. It proved popular, went through a number of editions, and helped establish Moore's reputation among literary critics. The work had a political aspect: Sheridan was not only a playwright, he was a Whig politician and a friend of Fox. Moore judged Sheridan an uncertain friend of reform. But he has Sheridan articulate in his own words a good part of what was to be the United Irish case for separation from England.\nWriting in 1784 to his brother, Sheridan explains that the \"subordinate situation [of Ireland] prevents the formation of any  party among us, like those you have in England, composed of person acting upon certain principles, and pledged to support each other\". Without the prospect of obtaining power \u2013 which in Ireland is \"lodged in a branch of the English government\" (the Dublin Castle executive) \u2013 there is little point in the members of parliament, no matter how personally disinterested, collaborating for any public purpose. Without an accountable executive the interests of the nation are systematically neglected.It is against this, the truncated state of politics in Ireland, that Moore sees Lord Edward Fitzgerald, a \"Protestant reformer\" who wished for \"a democratic House of Commons and the Emancipation of his Catholic countrymen\", driven toward the republican separatism of the United Irishmen. He absolves Fitzgerald of recklessness: but for a contrary wind, decisive French assistance would have been delivered by General Hoche at Bantry in December 1796. In his own Memoirs, Moore acknowledges his Life and Death of Lord Edward Fitzgerald (1831) as a \"justification of the men of '98 \u2013 the ultimi Romanorum of our country\".Moore's History of Ireland, published in four volumes between 1835 and 1846, reads as a further and extended indictment of English rule. It was an enormous work, but not a critical success. Moore acknowledged scholarly failings, some of which stemmed from his inability to read documentary sources in Irish.\n\n\n=== O'Connell and Repeal ===\nIn 1832, Moore declined a voter petition from Limerick to stand for the Westminster Parliament as a Repeal candidate. When Daniel O'Connell took this as evidence of Moore's \"lukewarmness in the cause of Ireland\", Moore recalled O'Connell's praise for the \"treasonous truths\" of his book on Fitzgerald. The difficulty, Moore suggested, was that these \"truths\" did not permit him to pretend with O'Connell that reversing the Acts of Union would amount to something less than real and lasting separation from Great Britain. Relations had been difficult enough after the old Irish Parliament had secured its legislative independence from London in 1782. But with a Catholic Parliament in Dublin, \"which they would be sure to have out and out\", the British government would be continually at odds, first over the disposal of Church of Ireland and absentee property, and then over what would be perennial issues of trade, foreign treaties and war.So \"hopeless appeared the fate of Ireland under English government, whether of Whigs or Tories\", that Moore declared himself willing to \"run the risk of Repeal, even with separation as its too certain consequence.\" But with Lord Fitzgerald, Moore believed independence possible only in union with the \"Dissenters\" (the Presbyterians) of the north (and possibly then, again only with a prospect of French intervention). To make \"headway against England\" the \"feeling\" of Catholics and Dissenters had first to be \"nationalised\". This is something Moore thought might be achieved by fixing upon the immediate abuses of the (Anglican and landed) \"Irish establishment\". As had been his uncompromising stance on the Veto controversy, O'Connell's promotion of Repeal was, in this respect, unhelpful, at best \"premature\".This perspective was shared by some of O'Connell's younger lieutenants, dissidents with the Repeal Association. Young Irelander Charles Gavan Duffy sought to build a \"League of North and South\" around what Michael Davitt (of the later Land League) described as \"the programme of the Whiteboys and Ribbonmen reduced to moral and constitutional standards\"--tenant rights and land reform.\n\n\n== Irish Melodies ==\n\n\n=== Reception ===\nIn the early years of his career, Moore's work was largely generic, and had he died at this point he would likely not have been considered an Irish poet. From 1806 to 1807, Moore dramatically changed his style of writing and focus. Following a request by the publishers James and William Power, he wrote lyrics to a series of Irish tunes in the manner of Haydn's settings of British folksongs, with Sir John Andrew Stevenson as arranger of the music. The principal source for the tunes was Edward Bunting's A General Collection of the Ancient Irish Music (1797) to which Moore had been introduced at Trinity by Edward Hudson. The Melodies were published in ten volumes, together with a supplement, over 26 years between 1808 and 1834. The musical arrangements of the last volumes, following Stevenson's death in 1833, were by Henry Bishop.\nThe Melodies were an immediate success, the \"The Last Rose of Summer\", \"The Minstrel Boy\", \"Believe Me If All Those Endearing Young Charms\" and \"Oft in the Stilly Night\" becoming immensely popular. There were parodies in England, but translations into German, Italian, Hungarian, Czech, and French, and settings by Hector Berlioz guaranteed a large European audience. In the United States, \"The Last Rose of Summer\" alone sold more than a million copies.Byron said he knew them all \"by rote and by heart\"; setting them above epics and Moore above all other poets for his \"peculiarity of talent, or rather talents, \u2013 poetry, music, voice, all his own\". They were also praised by Sir Walter Scott who conceded that neither he nor Byron could attain Moore's power of adapting words to music. Moore was in no doubt that the Irish Melodies would be \"the only work of my pen [\u2026]  whose fame (thanks to the sweet music in which it is embalmed) may boast a chance of prolonging its existence to a day much beyond our own\".\n\n\n=== Ireland's \"national music\" ===\nThe \"ultra-Tory\" The Anti-Jacobin Review  (\"Monthly Political and Literary Censor\")  discerned something more than innocuous drawing-room ballads: \"several of them were composed in a very disordered state of society, if not in open rebellion. They are the melancholy ravings of the disappointed rebel, or his ill-educated offspring\". Moore was providing texts to what he described as \"our national music\", and his lyrics did often \"reflect an unmistakable intimation of dispossession and loss in the music itself\".\nDespite Moore's difficult relationship with O'Connell, in the early 1840s his Melodies were employed in the \"Liberator's\" renewed campaign for Repeal. The Repeal Association's monster meetings (crowds of over 100,000) were usually followed by public banquets. At Mallow, Co. Cork,, before the dinner speeches, a singer performed Moore's \"Where is the Slave?\": Oh, where's the slave so lowly, Condemned to chains unholy, Who could be burst His bonds accursed, Would die beneath them slowly? O'Connell leapt to his feet, threw his arms wide and cried \"I am not that slave!\" All the room followed: \"We are not those slaves! We are not those slaves!\"In the greatest meeting of all, at the Hill of Tara (by tradition the inaugural seat of the High Kings of Ireland), on the feast-day of the Assumption, 15 August 1843, O'Connell's carriage proceeded through a crowd, reportedly of a million, accompanied by a harpist playing Moore's \"The Harp that once through Tara's Halls\".\n\n\n== Byron's Memoirs ==\nMoore was much criticised for allowing himself to be persuaded, on the grounds of their indelicacy, to destroy Byron's Memoirs. Modern scholarship assigns the blame elsewhere. \nIn 1821, with Byron's blessing, Moore sold the manuscript, with which Byron had entrusted him three years before, to the publisher John Murray. Although he himself allowed that it contained some \"very coarse things\", when, following Bryon's death in 1824, Moore learned that Murray had deemed the material unfit for publication he spoke of settling the matter with a duel. But the combination of Byron's wife Lady Byron, half-sister and executor Augusta Leigh and Moore's rival in Byron\u2019s friendship John Cam Hobhouse prevailed. In what some were to call the greatest literary crime in history, in Moore's presence the family solicitors tore up all extant copies of the manuscript and burned them in Murray's fireplace.With the assistance of papers provided by Mary Shelley, retrieved what he could. His Letters and Journals of Lord Byron: With Notices of His Life (1830) \"contrived\", in the view of Macaulay, \"to exhibit so much of the character and opinions of his friend, with so little pain to the feelings of the living\". Lady Byron still professed herself scandalised--as did The Times.With Byron an inspiration, Moore previously published a collection of songs, Evenings in Greece, (1826) and, set in 3rd-century Egypt, his only prose novel The Epicurean (1827). Supplying a demand for \"semi-erotic romance tinged with religiosity\" it was a popular success.\n\n\n== Death ==\nIt is a criticism of Moore that he \"wrote too much and catered too deliberately to his audiences\". In his lyrics there is a bathos that speaks both to a love of recitation and to an abiding sense of tragedy that is perhaps lost on the modern reader. \nOft, in the stilly night,\nEre slumber\u2019s chain has bound me,\nFond memory brings the light\nOf other days around me;\nThe smiles, the tears,\nOf boyhood\u2019s years,\nThe words of love then spoken;\nThe eyes that shone,\nNow dimm\u2019d and gone,\nThe cheerful hearts now broken!...\nWhen I remember all\nThe friends, so link\u2019d together,\nI\u2019ve seen around me fall,\nLike leaves in wintry weather;\nI feel like one\nWho treads alone\nSome banquet-hall deserted,\nWhose lights are fled,\nWhose garlands dead,\nAnd all but he departed!...\n\n In the late 1840s (and as the catastrophe of the Great Famine overtook Ireland), Moore's powers began to fail. He was reduced ultimately to senility, which came suddenly in December 1849.  Moore died on February 25, 1852, preceded by all his children and by most of his friends and companions.\n\n\n== Commemmoration ==\nMoore is often considered Ireland's national bard and is to Ireland what Robert Burns is to Scotland. Moore is commemorated in several places: by a plaque on the house where he was born, by busts at The Meetings and Central Park, New York, and by a bronze statue near Trinity College Dublin. There is a road in Walkinstown, Dublin, named Thomas Moore Road, in a series of roads named after famous composers, locally referred to as the Musical Roads.\n\nMany composers have set the poems of Thomas Moore to music. They include Gaspare Spontini, Robert Schumann, Hector Berlioz, Charles Ives, William Bolcom, Lori Laitman, Benjamin Britten and Henri Duparc.\nMany songs of Thomas Moore are cited in works of James Joyce, for example \"Silent, O Moyle\" in Two Gallants (Dubliners) or \"The Last Rose of Summer\".\nOliver Onions quotes Moore's poem \"Oft in the Stilly Night\" in his 1910 ghost story \"The Cigarette Case\". It is also referenced in Bob Shaw's 1966 science-fiction story \"Light of Other Days\".\nThe earliest known photograph taken by a woman (Constance Fox Talbot) is an albeit somewhat unclear image of a few lines from one of his poems.\nLetitia Elizabeth Landon offers a tribute in her poem, Thomas Moore, Esq., in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1839.\n\n\n== List of works ==\n\n\n=== Prose ===\nA Letter to the Roman Catholics of Dublin (1810)\nMemoirs of Captain Rock (1824)\nMemoirs of the Life of Richard Brinsley Sheridan (2 vols.)

        "wiki": "Bunratty Castle (Irish: Caisle\u00e1n Bhun Raithe, meaning \"Castle at the Mouth of the Ratty\") is a large 15th-century tower house in County Clare, Ireland. It is located in the centre of Bunratty village (Irish: Bun R\u00e1ite), by the N18 road between Limerick and Ennis, near Shannon Town and its airport. The castle and the adjoining folk park are run by Shannon Heritage as tourist attractions.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name Bunratty, Bun Raite (or possibly, Bun na Raite) in Irish, means \"river basin\" of the 'Ratty' river. This river, alongside the castle, flows into the nearby Shannon estuary.\n\n\n=== Earlier structures ===\n\nThe first recorded settlement at the site may have been a Norsemen settlement/trading camp reported in the Annals of the Four Masters to have been destroyed by Brian Boru in 977. According to local tradition, such a camp was located on a rise south-west of the current castle. However, since no actual remains of this settlement have yet been found, its exact location is unknown and its existence is not proven.Around 1250, King Henry III of England granted the cantred or district of Tradraighe (or Tradree) to Robert De Muscegros, who in 1251 cut down around 200 trees in the King's wood at Cratloe. These may have been used to construct a motte and bailey castle, which would have been the first castle at Bunratty, but again the exact position of this is unknown. A later reference in the state papers, dating to 1253 gives de Muscegros the right to hold markets and an annual fair at Bunratty. It has thus been assumed that the site was the centre of early Norman control in south-eastern Clare. Early 19th-century scholars put the structure to the north-west of the current castle. However, when a hotel was constructed there in 1959, John Hunt excavated the area and thought the remains to be that of a gun emplacement from the Confederate Wars (see below).\n\nThese lands were later handed back to (or taken back by) King Henry III and granted to Thomas De Clare, a descendant of Strongbow in 1276. De Clare built the first stone structure on the site (the second castle). This castle was occupied from ca. 1278 to 1318 and consisted of a large single stone tower with lime white walls. It stood close to the river, on or near the site of the present Bunratty Castle. In the late 13th century, Bunratty had about 1,000 inhabitants. The castle was attacked several times by the O'Briens (or O'Brians) and their allies. In 1284, while De Clare was away in England, the site was captured and destroyed. On his return, in 1287, De Clare had the site rebuilt and a 140-yard (130 m) long fosse built around it. The castle was again attacked but it did not fall until 1318. In that year a major battle was fought at Dysert O'Dea as part of the Irish Bruce Wars, in which both Thomas De Clare and his son Richard were killed. Lady De Clare, on learning this, fled from Bunratty to Limerick after burning castle and town. The De Clare family never returned to the area and the remains of the castle eventually collapsed. As the stones were likely used for other local construction works, no traces remain of this second castle.In the 14th century, Limerick was an important port for the English Crown. To guard access via the Shannon estuary against attacks from the Irish, the site was once again occupied. In 1353, Sir Thomas de Rokeby led an English army to conquer the MacNamaras and MacCarthys. A new castle (the third) was built at Bunratty, but once again, its exact location is unknown. Local tradition holds that it stood at the site where the Bunratty Castle Hotel was later constructed. However, the new structure was hardly finished before being captured by the Irish. Documents show that in 1355, King Edward III of England released Thomas Fitzjohn Fitzmaurice from prison in Limerick. He had been charged with letting the castle fall into the hands of Murtough O\u2019Brien whilst serving as a Governor (Captain) of Bunratty.\n\n\n=== Current structure ===\nThe fourth castle, the present structure, was built by the MacNamara family after around 1425. Its builder may have been one Maccon Sioda MacNamara, chieftain of Clann Cuilein (i.e. the MacNamaras). He died before the castle was completed which happened under his son Sean Finn (died in 1467). At around 1500, Bunratty Castle came into the hands of the O'Briens (or O'Brians), the most powerful clan in Munster and later Earls of Thomond. They expanded the site and eventually made it their chief seat, moving it there from Ennis.In 1558, the castle\u2014now noted as one of the principal strongholds of Thomond\u2014was taken by Thomas Radclyffe, the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland from Donal O'Brien of Duagh, last King of Thomond (died 1579), and given to Donal's nephew, Connor O'Brien. Donogh O'Brien, Conor's son, may have been the one to move the seat of the family from Clonroad (Ennis) to Bunratty. He made various improvements to the castle including putting a new lead roof on it.During the Confederate Wars set off by the Irish Rebellion of 1641, Lord Forbes, commanding forces of the English Long Parliament, was allowed by the then Lord Barnabas O'Brien to occupy Bunratty in 1646. Barnabas did not want to commit to either side in the struggle, playing off royalists, rebels and roundheads against each other. He left for England, where he joined King Charles. Defence of the castle, whose position allowed those holding it to blockade maritime access to Limerick (held by the Confederates) and the river Shannon, was in the hands of Rear-Admiral Penn, the father of William Penn, founder of Pennsylvania. After a long siege, the Confederates took the castle. Penn surrendered but was allowed to sail away to Kinsale.Barnabas O'Brien died in 1657, but had apparently leased out the castle to one \"John Cooper\", likely the same person married to M\u00e1ire n\u00ed Mahon of Leamaneh Castle, widow of another O'Brien, Conor (died 1651). Bunratty Castle remained property of the O'Briens and in the 1680s the castle was still the principal seat of the Earls of Thomond. In 1712, Henry, the 8th and last Earl of Thomond (1688\u20131741) sold Bunratty Castle and 472 acres (191 ha) of land to Thomas Amory for \u00a3225 and an annual rent of \u00a3120. Amory in turn sold the castle to Thomas Studdert who moved in ca. 1720.The Studdert family left the castle (allowing it to fall into disrepair), to reside in the more comfortable and modern adjacent \"Bunratty House\" they had built in 1804.For some time in the mid-19th century, the castle was used as a barracks by the Royal Irish Constabulary. In 1894, Bunratty was once again used by the Studdert family, as the seat of Captain Richard Studdert. In the late 19th century, the roof of the Great Hall collapsed.In 1956, the castle was purchased and restored by the 7th Viscount Gort, with assistance from the Office of Public Works. He reroofed the castle and saved it from ruin. The castle was opened to the public in 1960, sporting furniture, tapestries and works of art dating to around 1600.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nChristopher Lynch, Bunratty Castle, Volume 41 of The Irish Heritage Series, Eason 1984, ISBN 0900346566.\n\n\n== External links ==\nShannon Heritage website\nA picture showing the castle before its 1950s restoration\nNational Inventory of Architectural Heritage: Bunratty Castle\nNational Inventory of Architectural Heritage: Bunratty Bridge\nNational Inventory of Architectural Heritage: Bunratty House\nNational Inventory of Architectural Heritage: Bunratty Castle Hotel",

          "Wow! We really enjoyed Bunratty castle and folk park! The castle is very well restored with many rooms and floors to explore. It makes for beautiful castle pictures. The 19th century folk town is so well done, you almost feel like you are walking through an old Irish town.",
          "Was hesitant to go because we had already gone to a couple other castles, but this one by far was our favorite! Very authentic!! The steps in the castle can be tricky so keep this in mind. The village was freat too. Loved that it seemed sonreal, like a step back in time. Would",

          "The castle is several stories high with appropriate decoration and very small stairs in places. Definitely not for anyone with knee or hip issues if you plan to go to the top. The Folk Park is nicely done with enough to amuse young and old.",
          "This is a very interesting castle to visit. The tour guide was very informative, after which we were free to explore the castle in our own time. Note that there are quite a few steps and it is very narrow in places. The adjoining large folk park/ village was also very",

          "Bunratty Castle differs from some of the others you might see in Ireland as it is furnished and intact much as it would have been back in its heyday. You get a sense of how royalty in the 1400's lived, not so grand as in the old poems and stories. There are some lovely carved",
          "Visited Bunratty Castle twice with different family members in September. What a great place to visit, incredibly interesting with lots to see and do. Good food and really good coffee in the cafe, gift shop also has plenty of quality gifts.",

          "Really enjoyed our day out at Bunratty Folk Park. Lots to do and see, plenty of staff willing and ready to explain things and talk with such enthusiasm about the history of Ireland. The kids really enjoyed the Fairy Village, really well done and so much though and detail put in.",
          "This re-created \"living history\" park seems very authentic with many buildings, attractive medieval settings, and lots of interesting details. We enjoyed walking around and looking at all the features even though the park was \"closed\" and the period re-enactors had gone for the",

          "It's a fun place to spend an hour or two looks about at the old castle and the different old homes that they've moved in so you can see, and feel what they were like back in the day. Yes, it is set up for tourists so it's safe, informative, and maybe a little bland. You'll want",
          "Get past the gift shop (one of the best we saw, though), and this is a worthwhile 25+ acre historic park and exhibit leading up to the castle itself. Worth the walk, which can be slippery if wet, and is typically crushed stone. The inside of the castle itself is NOT the draw;",
          "The Bunratty castle is a great castle to see and hear the stories around the castle. The tour was informative and was great to see almost all the rooms in the castle. The grounds around the castle had lots of buildings to tour as well depicting the times and lives of the people",
          "Amazing experience with original relics on display. Explore the castle on your own there are lots of rooms to discover. Before you go, ask the staff, they will explain the rooms for you. If you\u2019re able, you can climb to the top of the castle tower. The grounds are easy to walk",

          "A very interesting restored castle. Be aware there are a lot of steps and steep stairways within the castle. Guides are knowledgeable. The restored houses, main street and buildings in \"the park\" are very very interesting. You should plan to spend at least a morning and maybe",
          "One of the most interesting places and really worth of your time in Ireland. The castle was renovated in 1960 and transfers you to medieval ages. There is a village with houses that are kept in an original condition and you can see how they were living at these times. Highly",
          "We were so disappointed as we weren\u2019t told that the park was open, however everything within the park was closed. We did get a reduced entrance fee but that wasn\u2019t worth the cost.",

          "We had a wonderful day at the castle and folk park (didn't do the banquet). The castle seems very authentic with its narrow stair cases and stone walls, complete with a deep, dark dungeon. The folk park is vast with an artificial village that conveys the spirit of times past",
          "The castle was amazing but what really surprised us were the shops in the \"village\" surrounding the castle. Each shop was staffed by an artist selling their own creations. It was wonderful buying directly from the artist. We talked at length with 4 artists - 2 women and 2 men.",
          "Our tour group attended the Medieval Banquet at the castle, and was really looking forward to it. We had a terrible experience because the castle admin did not book our group correctly, meaning some of our travel companions were not allowed to sit with us (they gave their seats",

          "We really enjoyed the castle. It was fun to be able to climb the towers to the roof and observe the upper rooms. Worth the price. The village was winding down because we were there late in the day, would likely ha ve been better to view earlier when more staff was on site.",
          "Went for the evening banquet, and it was marvelous. The food was delicious, and the entertainment was topnotch. When the sharpest played her solo, you could have heard a pin drop. Just a fabulous evening!!!",

          "This is a nice castle to tour. Although I would suggest you be in reasonable shape to do so, as you will be going up and down some very narrow and steep stairways and into some cramped quarters. The visitor center is nice too and filled will all sorts of tourist",
          "The Folk Park at Bunratty Castle is well worth a couple of hours' visit. One should take the time to walk into every house, building, or enclosure because there is something to offer in each one. Animals (especially ducks and chickens) roam around freely. You might even run",
          "This was a very nice place to visit on our travels in Ireland. We didn't go in the castle but walked around the area. This was a wonderful first stop in Ireland! It's always great to see a castle!",

          "Four of us went to the feast at 8:45 PM on a Sunday night. I'll start by saying the actors do a great job. They work hard as actors, singers and servers during the feast. The entertainment is well done but a bit cheesy. It's like going to Medieval Times in North America without",
          "Went here for the afternoon on our way home and really enjoyed it. We had the dog with us but was allowed bring him with us although we weren't allowed inside the castle but the rest of the place was allowed. Loads to see and do and very dog friendly which was a nice change. Tea",

          "This was the first visit of our 1 week holiday in Ireland and we could not have started better! The castle is well restorated in a realistic manner, looks very good and the folk park is lovely. We spent more than 3 hours here and could have stayed even longer. Highly reccomended",
          "We hosted French visitors here last summer and this attraction was definitely one of the best ways to spend a day! We started the day by visiting the folk park which the younger children loved due to all the animals and various attractions. That night we returned to the banquet",
          "Great music, good performers and the food is just so so. Mead is not what I would call a delicious drink, but it is an experience. I'd much rather have a good cold Miller Lite. The entertainment is well worth your effort",
          "Having visited here many years ago with my parents, I wanted to bring my children here also. They found it interesting and could relate to what they were being taught in school about medieval and our no so distant past. Castle and folk park were well laid out and younger kids",
          "Visited this place years ago when my children were small so decided to come back again now they are older and it is still as good, its like stepping back in time. The whole place has a good feel to it and staff are friendly and welcoming overall a good day out.",
          "We were told to skip this, that it was \u2018touristy\u2019. We were so glad that we didn\u2019t listen! Bunratty Castle and Folk Park was informative and fun and beautiful! The garden flowers were in full bloom. The grounds are kept clean and trimmed nicely. I spent a while sitting on one",
          "My wife, daughters (8 & 5) and I visited Bunratty Castle and Park last weekend. Each area was numbered so it was easy to follow on the map we were. The girls loved the adventure of going from house to house. We would definitely recommend a trip to Bunratty.",

          "We went primarily to see the castle, but the whole park was very interesting and, in places, very attractive. It gave us a bit of insight into rural Irish life a century or more ago.",
          "Lots to see at the castle, there are a large number of thatched cottages in the grounds, showing you how different jobs gave you a different size and equipped cottage. You can walk into each one. There is also an old replica street of shops, pub and post office to wander around,",

          "We thought we were only going to see a castle but when we realized the Folk Park was part of the admission price, we were pleasantly surprised. It is well laid out with the castle and farm buildings at one end and the town layout at the other end. The buildings all had small",

          "The castle is well preserved and contains many old pieces of furniture and has a nice display in the main hall. The stairs are not bad for most visitors and the village is worth a stroll through and is mostly shady for a hot day. The gift shop is nice and the staff is helpful.",
          "Every year I\u2019m in Ireland visiting family and of course shopping. Years ago I gave up trying to get my VAT back w the long airport lines. Today shopping at Blarney Woollen Mills in Bunratty park with their beautiful collection of ponchos, blankets, scarves, etc.., I went to pay",
          "We self guided ourselves through Bunratty Castle. This is not for front of heart as you climb up into four turrets along single file staircases but you really get the experience of what it must have been like. Folk park part would be great for kids- fairy trail and animals and",
          "We visited Bunratty yesterday as we had not been to the site in the last four years. Bunratty offers consistency and variety in its visitor experience. We did the tour of the folk park first as the forecasted rain had not yet arrived. The different homesteads are interesting to",
          "This castle is authentic, it is just the way it was way back when. The castle has 4 towers, and each tower has a narrow winding staircase. The Folk Park is also as authentic as possible, with houses and shops recreated to show how how both the wealthy and the peasants lived.",
          "The visit to Bunratty Castle was a spontaneous one, but I do not regret a minute of it. I loved walking in the park and around the castle. I really loved the fact that there were people there able to tell us a bit about the history and the origins of the exhibits. We will",

          "Bunratty was a great experience. The tours are self-guided and an easy to read tour pamphlet is provided. There is more to the tour than just the castle. The village reenactment is great for families and full of information. The tour took roughly and hour, but we did go pretty",

          "We enjoyed walking around the park. The castle is nice; kids would love it. There is a guide in costume to tell you some of the history. Kids love the dungeon--not too cool but just the thought of going down the stairs. Lots of winding stairs and castle-like furniture/settings.",

          "There were so many gardens and animals to see. Our kids (8 & 1) loved the fairy trail. We enjoyed stopping for ice cream and seeing the little shops. The highlight was the castle. So fun to see a real castle. Only complaint is that it was tough to do with a baby. The rest of the",
          "Very interesting ! First time in a real castle and not disappointed. We learned alot from the reason the stairs are steep and curved to why there were tortoise shells hanging in the kitchen. The farmers cottage and grounds were neat too. Baby goats, roosters, turkeys..oh my!",
          "What a beautiful castle. It is well maintained and the grounds are also. The folk park has something for everyone. Each building has a story and the town that comes together when you enter is just amazing! I highly recommend that you see this one. I can see why it is top 10",

          "The castle itself was sort of a typical Irish Castle. The tour was good, but there were several large groups that were non-English speaking, so we sort of avoided that to be able to see things at our own pace. The interior is nicely restored, and the village around the castle",
          "By the time I reached the park, I was already quite cross! There is no sign to tell you where to turn, so I was led back onto the motorway and had a ten mile round trip to get back again. When I mentioned this I was asked \"didn't you see the castle?\" !! I have been to folk",
          "Bunratty was the best castle we saw. I was not disappointed. It was a residential castle so a lot to see and learn. Unlike King John\u2019s Castle that was a guarding castle where there wasn\u2019t much to se. I am glad we went",
          "I had no idea how big this park and castle were. Very well done and kept up. Make sure you stop at the Tea Room and have some of their pastry. Try to Tour the Castle first. It closes before everything else.",
          "So many displays in the Folk Park remind me of my younger days, the thatched roofs, turf fire with fire-crane over, the old farm implements and accessories. These are highlights of any visit together with a tour of the castle. It never ceases to amaze how the inhabitants climbed",
          "We started in the castle and were taken round by a guide who told us all about the castle's history. We were warned in advance that some of the steps were steep and some of the visitors in our group couldn't manage to get up the narrow staircases. The Folk Park was very",

          "Bunratty castle and grounds could be covered in half a day or less. The castle itself was the focal point of my trip. The whole family loved it. Multiple spiral stone stairwells take you up into the castle for a realistic understanding of what castle life must have been like.",
          "What a great experience. I really enjoyed the folk Park Walking around the village really takes you back in time. It was so good that if I won the lottery I'd buy it . I was so taken back by the whole experience. Such beautiful scenery and walks. On the other hand I would have",
          "We took a chance on visiting this old castle even though we expected it to be too touristy with the Folk Park attached. It was a rainy day and spending time in the castle was a fun, dry and history packed visit. The Folk park was much better than we expected and highly",
          "So much history here. A castle seeped in the past and brought to life by the knowledgeable guides. A walk around the village, full of nostalgia from a distant age and a visit to the school house to hear the wonderful voices and music from the entertainers there.",
          "We visited out of peak season and were pleasantly surprised. Allow about 2 to 3 hours. In addition to the publicised buildings it was the staff that made the day, the baker, the singer and fiddler, the policeman all added to the experience but the highest marks must go to the",

          "This castle is easy to drive to and is nicely planned. The castle itself is basically just a keep, very similar to others of the same era. It is well preserved/restored. The reenactment village is interesting and nice to wander through. On the whole it's a bit pricey.",
          "On the day we visited it was quite busy with schools groups but we were able to moderate our visits to various parts of the outdoor exhibits to avoid them. The attractions have a variety of rebuilt houses to demonstrate life and experiences in years gone by. There are staff who",

          "Bunratty had to be one of our favorite castles to tour on our trip. We visited in November, so it wasn't crowded. The stairwells are extremely narrow with small steps, so I could imagine visiting during crowded times could be more of a challenge. The castle grounds is what",

          "I guess more of a keep than a castle, but no less imposing for that. Great riverside location only spoiled by the tourist tat shops across the street. Still, if it wasn't for the tourists the old place would probably have slid into the river generations ago. Try it.",

          "We took a tour of the grounds/village, then went inside the castle for the Medieval feast. Wonderful! Yes, I certainly would have preferred having a knife and fork to eat, but that wouldn't have been authentic. Totally enjoyable time. And I really did enjoy tasting the honey",
          "Excellent example of a refurbished castle, takes you back to the time it was actively being used. Not a good place if you are claustrophobic as the stairways are long and narrow, and somewhat dark. Grounds give you an example of how people lived back then...I'd say a great place",

        "wiki": "Adare (; Irish: \u00c1th Dara, meaning \"ford of [the] oak\") is a village in County Limerick, Ireland, located south-west of the city of Limerick. Renowned as one of Ireland's prettiest towns, Adare is designated as a heritage town by the Irish government.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe River Maigue is tidal as far as Adare, with the settlement forming around the eastern bank of the Maigue overlooking the fording point from which the village gets its name. An annalistic reference is made in the medieval Annals of Inisfallen at AI982.4 \"The Tree of Mag Adar was broken by Leth Cuinn\". Owing to the strategic importance of the river crossing the Desmond castle was built overlooking the site near Ardshanbally (derived from Ard an tSeanbhaile - 'high ground of the old town'), and was first mentioned in 1226. Historically a market town, in the Middle Ages, Adare boasted three monasteries. Owing to the influence of the Earls of Dunraven, who built the Adare Manor (now a luxury resort hotel) a strict plan was laid out for the town.\n\n\n=== Desmond Castle ===\n\nA castle or fortress is said to have first been built with an ancient ring-fort, by the O'Donovans, rulers of the region into the late 12th century, and afterwards to have passed into the possession of the Kildare branch of the FitzGerald dynasty, who may be responsible for the majority of the remains of the present fortress (which occurred with Croom Castle, also on the Maigue). Desmond Castle, as it is popularly known, stands on the north bank of the Maigue. An extensive renovation has been in progress on the castle since 1996 and supervised tours are offered in the summer months.  This is one of a series of significant Desmond properties, which also include Desmond Hall and Castle in Newcastle West, another castle in Askeaton and Castle Matrix near Rathkeale, further west in County Limerick.\n\n\n=== Augustinian Priory ===\n\nAdare's Augustinian Priory was founded in 1316 by John FitzThomas FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Kildare. The Priory was suppressed in the reign of Henry VIII. In 1807, the church of the Priory was given to the local Church of Ireland congregation as the parish church. In 1814, the refectory was roofed and converted into a schoolhouse. Between 1852 and 1854, a second restoration of the church was undertaken by Caroline, Countess of Dunraven.\n\n\n=== Franciscan Abbey ===\nThe Franciscan friary was founded in 1464 by Thomas Fitz-Maurice, 7th Earl of Kildare and his wife Joan, and completed two years later. It is currently a ruin and is located inside the Adare Manor Golf Club.\n\n\n=== Trinitarian Abbey ===\n\nThe Trinitarian Order established their only monastery in Ireland in Adare in 1230. It is believed that the Trinitarian monks who came to Adare may have come from Scotland. The Abbey was restored in 1811 by the first Earl of Dunraven as the Catholic Parish church.\n\n\n=== Adare Manor ===\nAdare Manor is a mansion located on lands on the banks of the River Maiguem and the former seat of the Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl. The present building was built in the early 19th-century in a Tudor-revival style, while retaining part of an earlier structure. It is now the Adare Manor Hotel & Golf Resort, a luxury resort hotel, reopened after an extensive restoration in October 2017.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe main street combines typical Irish architecture with the English styled buildings and infrastructure purpose-built for the Dunraven estate. Examples of the latter architectural forms include the thatched cottages near the entrance to Adare Manor.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAdare is a tourist destination and the local heritage centre, which gives insight into the history of the village, also hosts a number of craft shops. The village is a wedding and conference venue. Adare has two 18-hole golf courses - the Adare Golf Club, which incorporates a driving range and which was the site of the 2007 and 2008 Irish Open, the Adare Manor Golf Club and a pitch and putt course. Adare also has an equestrian centre, located  in Clonshire.\n\n\n=== Schools ===\nThere are four primary schools in Adare: St Joseph's National School (Catholic, boys), Our Lady's Abbey National School (Catholic, girls), St Nicholas' National School (Church of Ireland, mixed) and Shountrade National School (Catholic, mixed). The village's secondary school, Adare CBS, closed in 1973.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nThe main Limerick-Tralee road, the N21 passes through the village, causing persistent heavy congestions.  In late 2015 a corridor for the long-delayed bypass was chosen that realigns the N21 road north of the village as part of a new dual carriageway planned to link Foynes port to Limerick.\nAdare is a stop on Bus \u00c9ireann's Limerick-Tralee/Killarney bus service and Dublin Coach's Dublin-Tralee/Killarney service. Both run hourly.\nThe abandoned \"Limerick-Foynes\" railway line passes 800 metres (half a mile) to the north-west of the town. Adare railway station, opened on 12 July 1856 by the Limerick & Foynes Railway company, was closed to passengers on 4 February 1963 and to freight on 2 December 1974. The line to Foynes continued to carry freight traffic until it was mothballed in 2001 and has seen no trains since 7 May 2002 when the annual Irish Rail weedspray train visited the line. The line, designated an engineers siding, is still officially open for traffic.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nAdare GAA club was founded in 1929. The senior hurling team has won the county championship in 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 and 2009. In football, the Club won the County Intermediate Football Title in 2016 and gained promotion back to The Limerick Senior Football Championship. In 2017, Adare won the County Senior Title for the first time, beating Newcastle West in the Final. In 2018, the club went on to retain the title, becoming the first team in Limerick GAA history to win 2 senior titles immediately following success at intermediate level.\nThe local soccer team is Adare United AFC. The club play at Deer Park Field, situated just off the Blackabbey Road in the village. Founded in 1937, Adare has one of the oldest soccer clubs outside Limerick city. Adare United participate in the Limerick Desmond Schoolboys/Girls League at Under 8, U10, U12, U14 and U16 age groups and in the Limerick Desmond League at Junior (adult) and Youth level. The 2006/07 Season saw the club form its first ladies team, who compete in the Limerick Desmond Ladies League. In the 2009/10 Season, the ladies were runners up in the League Cup, losing on penalties to Glin Rovers FC. The team were also cup finalists the following year, this time in the Desmond Cup but were beaten by Murroe FC. The Under 10 team were Division 3 Champions in the 2008/09 season and Division 4 winners in 2010/11. The Under 8 team completed a league and cup double in 2010/11. The Junior team won promotion from Division Two in the 2008/2009 season and immediately gained promotion to the premier league the following year. Adare Ladies won the Desmond Cup in the 2011/2012 season and were runners-up in League Division 1.\nThe Irish Open golf championship was staged there in 2007 and 2008. There are two 18-hole golf courses in the village: The Adare Golf Club which is on the grounds of the Adare Manor Hotel, and the Adare Manor Golf Club, which is a separate entity.\nThe Limerick Cricket Club play in the manor fields complex to the south of the village.\nThe town also plays a role in the West Limerick athletics scene, with it hosting the Adare 10K run every February since 1994.\n\n\n== Twin towns ==\nAdare has twinning connections to its sister towns in Germany.\n\nBuchloe, Germany\nBuckow, Germany\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of towns and villages in Ireland\nNicholas Peacock\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAdare Heritage Centre\nShannon Region Tourism's page on Adare\nGeneral Information on Adare\nObituary of the 7th Earl of Dunraven, Thady Wyndham-Quin\nIndex of the Earl of Dunraven Papers at the University of Limerick\nAdare local area plan (Limerick County Council)(2002)\nThe Tidy Towns of Ireland \"Celebrating 50 years\"\nKnockpatrick Gardens\nBunbury, Turtle, Adare Manor: The Renaissance of an Irish Country House (Adare Manor Publishing, 2019) ISBN 9781527246706",

        "wiki": "Limerick is a neighborhood one mile south of downtown Louisville, Kentucky USA.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe neighborhood was developed in the 1860s as a place of residence for employees of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad freight yard. It was named because nearly all of the residents were from the Irish county of Limerick. The St. Louis Bertrand Catholic Church was the centerpiece of the newly founded neighborhood. Limerick began the trend of working-class people living southwest of downtown, a trend which continues in the city to this day.\nThe working class Irish immigrants lived in modest shotgun houses, with a moderate number of African Americans living in the alleyways behind them, while upper income Irish, known as \"lace curtain Irish\", built mansion houses on St. Catherine Street. The Irish Catholic presence in Limerick was strong enough that from 1872 to 1918 an annual St Patrick's Day march went from the church to Broadway. But as many of the railroad jobs left the area, the Irish began to move to South Louisville.\nOn October 7, 1871, the Louisville Steam Engine Co. 7 was formed to provide fire protection to the \"southern suburbs\" of Louisville. Its firehouse at 821 S. 6th Street is the oldest continuously active firehouse in the U.S. On December 10, 2008, Louisville Mayor Jerry Abramson announced his intention to close the firehouse and disband the company on January 1, 2009.\n\nAs the Irish left, the African Americans moved from the alleyways into the vacated shotgun houses. In 1873, Louisville Central Public School, Kentucky's first state supported public school for African Americans was opened at 6th and Kentucky Streets. It would be later renamed Simmons College and finally Municipal College for Negros, a \"colored\" campus of the University of Louisville. The school is now in the process of reclaiming its former campus and is officially known as Simmons College of Kentucky.\nBeginning around 1874 Limerick was the site of two successive baseball fields, both named Eclipse Park and located at 7th and Kentucky streets (across the street from each other). They were the home of Louisville's major league team, the Louisville Colonels (originally the Louisville Eclipse) from 1882 until the team folded in 1899. It was here that Hall of Famer Honus Wagner made his major league debut on July 19, 1897.\nThe news weekly Kentucky Irish American would be published from Limerick for nearly seventy years, starting in 1898.\n\n\n== Historic preservation ==\nToday, Limerick is a historic preservation district. It is bounded by Breckinridge Street to the north, 5th street to the east, Oak Street to the south, and the CSX railroad tracks to the west.  South of Oak street, the eastern boundary is 7th street until it crosses the railroad tracks.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of 2000, the population of Limerick was 1,448, of which 56.5% are black, 37.7% are white, 3.8% are listed as other, and 2% are Hispanic. College graduates are 17.3% of the population, people without a high school degree are 21.2%. Males outnumber females 63.7% to 46.3%.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of the Irish in Louisville\nIrish Hill, Louisville\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nStreet map of Limerick\nImages of Limerick (Louisville, Ky.) in the University of Louisville Libraries Digital Collections\n\"Limerick: Generosity Was Cornerstone Upon Which Irish and Blacks Built Their Neighborhood\" \u2014 Article by Pat O'Connor of The Courier-Journal",

        "wiki": "Glin Castle is a Georgian country house and national heritage site located along the River Shannon in Glin, County Limerick, Ireland. The castle has belonged to the FitzGerald family for over seven hundred years and was the seat of the Knights of Glin.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe FitzGeralds first settled in the area in the thirteenth century, following the Norman invasion of Ireland, at the nearby Shanid Castle. In the fourteenth century the Earl of Desmond elevated an illegitimate son to the hereditary knighthood of Glin. Glin Castle became the permanent seat of the Knight of Glin. The castle was attacked during the Desmond Rebellions in the sixteenth century, the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in the seventeenth century, the Jacobite risings and the Enforcement of the Penal Laws. In 1601 the castle was besieged by British troops and the knight's son was kidnapped.In the late seventeenth century the castle had been abandoned and the FitzGerald family moved into a thatched longhouse adjacent to the castle. John Bateman FitzGerald, 23rd Knight of Glin married Margaretta Maria Fraunceis Gwyn in the 1780s and used her dowry to build a new castle in the Georgian style. Later Neoclassical elements were added to the building.In 1923 a mob of Sinn F\u00e9in members attacked the castle.In 1993 the FitzGeralds decided to turn the castle into a hotel to help pay for the upkeep. The hotel closed in 2008. In 2011 Desmond FitzGerald, 29th Knight of Glin died without a male heir. In 2015 the castle was put on auction at Christie's by Lady FitzGerald. The castle did not sell in auction. In an effort to keep the castle in the family, it was purchased by Catherine FitzGerald, daughter of the last Knight of Glin, and her husband Dominic West.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "As we drove into the village we caught glimpses of the castle. If we had more time in Adare I would have gone to get a closer look. We had seen a ton of castles on our trip so far so didn't feel the urgency to do more here.",
          "Desmond Castle in Adare is well worth the stop. We went to the Adare Heritage Center where we found our guide Mary who bussed us to the castle (left the car in the free parking at the center) and walked us through it while giving us the history. Helps to understand how they",
          "While driving the grounds of Adare Manor, we saw the ruins of Desmond Castle. The one located here should not be confused with a castle of the same name in Kinsale, County Cork. This castle was a fortress and the property of the Earls of Kildare until 1536. It was forfeited to",
          "Very entertaining and informative. Lovely guide. Well able to answer any questions. Well organized tour of Desmond castle on bank of river Maigue neat Adare Co Limerick",
          "I gave this a five because everyone on the bus said it was a must see. We unfortunately only got to see it from afar. The history and the setting were grand. The time of year to see it was excellent. And it not raining in Ireland was a plus. Highly recommend a stop on your way",
          "Worth an hour to take the tour. Starts at the Adare tourist center, where you take a bus with a guide to the castle. Interesting site with an interesting guide (Sophie).",
          "Thanks to Sophie, we had the best tour ever of a castle! She did a wonderful job explaining the history of the castle and answering our questions. Thank you for an awesome experience!",
          "Amazing tour through Desmond castle with our wonderful guide, Sophie. There was only 4 in the group so it felt very intimate. Would recommend, especially for the price. Can\u2019t get into the castle without the tour. Sophie was a wealth of knowledge and a energetic little",
          "A very lovely hour long trip through the castle, with a lady as a guide who really knew her stories. You can only book the tour through the heritage center as the castle is not open to the general public as they are scared it will be vandalised since it is a little out of town.",

          "But this one is better preserved and protected. You can only visit on a guided tour from the visitor centre, and the tour is worthwhile. Medieval Ireland comes to life.",
          "We took this tour with Sandra from the Adare Heritage Centre, which is the only way you can get in to the castle. She was very knowledgeable about the history and inner workings of the castle and did a great job helping us imagine what the castle was like in its heyday. She also",
          "We really enjoyed our tour! Sandra was a great guide and provided interesting details about all the rooms and history of the castle. I highly recommend a tour if you visit Adare",

          "We ordered our tickets from the Heritage Center and picked them up at the center. Then we boarded a bus to go just a mile or two up the rode(very nice little bus) Our tour guide was wonderful and entertaining and we didn't linger in one place too long. I typically don't like",
          "It was interesting to use one\u2019s imagination to fill in the gaps with what is left of this 13th century castle after it was ordered destroyed by Irish history\u2019s great villain, Oliver Cromwell. The tour guide gave a great context for the general Irish history of the centuries",
          "The only way to see this castle is by guided tour and the price is very reasonable. Tickets are available at the Adare visitor center in town and the price includes a bus ride to the site. The castle itself is mostly in ruins but it is amazing to be looking at something from",

          "Worth visiting this castle ruin: it can only be done via a free guided tour from the visitor centre where they take you to the castle on a small bus. When we went, on last tour of the day, there were just two couples. The guide was informative, engaging and made it",

          "I first want to state, any of the reviews that are saying you have to go through the golf course to get to this are posted on the wrong thing. That is the Adare Franciscan Friary. For the Desmond Castle you need to either go to the Adare heritage centre to get a ticket or you",

          "The roughly 90 minute tour was filled with much factual information on Desmond Castle, as well as fun and humor! I wish I could recall the names of our tour guide and bus driver, but they operate from the Adare Heritage Tours and were both delightful gals! The tours are",
          "The tour of Desmond Castle was very informative and interesting. The tour guide was knowledgeable and friendly.",
          "You can only see this castle by taking the tour leaving from the heritage centre by small coach--only 5 mins drive. Sandra our tour guide took us into each room and brought to life the activities that would have taken place in each. There was a lot to take in and you really had",
          "Very inexpensive tour \u20ac6 (senior), \u20ac8 adult. Evan was our guide. The only way to tour Desmond castle (est 13th century by the Earls of Dunraven) is to purchase a tour ticket at the information Centre in Adare. Small shuttle carries you up to the grounds. Very impressive",
          "Magnificent castle.You have to purchase your tickets at the tourist office in Adore and they bus you down.Fabulous photos and our guide was excellent",
          "Vera is a legend! This tour starts at the Adare visitor centre and one is shuttled from their to the ruins of Desmond Castle. Our guide - Vera the Legend - was a wonderful blend of charm, wit, and knowledge. Faced with a placid yet mischievous German family, she managed to keep",
          "This is not a tour of a fully restored castle like you may get many places. You are wandering mainly ruins. The setting for this castle is probably its best feature. It is on the river with green everywhere and a great bridge in front of it. We went across the road to the",
          "I wasn very happy with the tour guide we got of this castle. The tour guy was very knowledgeable. A lot of the castle is in ruins but what remains its worth seeing. It takes about an hour to do this trip. I found the tour great value and would highly reccomend it to people with",
          "We had a terrific local guide who was very knowledgeable. It is a ruined castle, but a lot of what existed a thousand years ago has been uncovered. Our guide could make us imagine Normans walking on the same stones that I was standing on. It was truly a worthwhile side trip.",
          "Not your average castle tour. Local tour guide with a lot of information. Castle was restored to a point. More of a ruin but enough there to get a sense of the place.",
          "\"Ashley\" did our tour and was fantastic. The history of this castle is incredibly interesting. I would highly recommend this tour. The whole thing with bus ride (Kathy our driver was incredibly sweet) is about 70 minutes.",

          "Very interesting and worth a visit. It is free and you can get a guided tour with staff who were knowledgeable",
          "You get this tour from the Adara Visitor's Center. There is a short bus ride and then about a 1 hour tour. The guide was very interesting and knew a lot about the history of the castle and the village. Well worthwhile to visit.",
          "Great for adults and older kids. We learned that they threw boiling water out of the window and that there was no glass so they used animal skins. Informative tour by Vera and appreciated the mini coach service.",
          "Came with the toddlers and it was great. Easily accessible thanks to the team at the Heritage Centre. Guide was personable and knowledgeable. The castle itself is well preserved (of what has been reproduced) and provides for some great ruin photos. Definitely worth a visit.",

          "Centuries of Irish history told in one beautiful location. Our guide was well-informed and kept the tour moving along at just the right pace. Highly recommended.",
          "We toured the castle with Anthony Sheehy, who lives nearby. He made the castle come alive with details of how people lived then. Pay what you want, which probably maximizes his income! Call him from the visitor center downtown. He only does tours on weekends, since repairs",
          "Did the guided tour available at the Adare Heritage Centre. Castle (Norman) and very good example. Very good commentary by guide and transport by minibus from Heritage Centre to site. Also commentary on Adare as we passed through on the way to the castle. Good value for money.",

          "While I reviewed this under Adare Heritage Centre as well, I should have done it here as my review was mainly focused on this tour. We were there towards the tail end of heritage week so it was very busy and since we came late in the afternoon all the tours were booked. As",
          "We did a tour of Desmond Castle with the Adare Heritage Centre. It is a great price and I think this is the only way to get in to see the castle. It was also a very informative and enjoyable tour. The tour guides were very nice and gave advice on other things in town.",
          "It is only possible to visit the castle now with a guided tour. I can only congratulate Vera, our tour guide, for introducing us to a whole history of the buildings in an informative, educational & engaging manner. She was EXCELLENT, knowledgeable & also funny (as appropriate!)",

          "The Castle in Askeaton - Eas Geitine - Desmond Castle is not even mentioned in the touristic flyers. During our first visit in Ireland last year, we discovered that the map will point us to some castles that were not mentioned anywhere. The sad part is that the castle is a",

        "wiki": "Craggaunowen is a 16th-century castle and an archaeological open-air museum in County Clare, Ireland.\nCraggaunowen is located 10 km east of Quin, County Clare. The name Craggaunowen derives from its Irish name Creag\u00e1n Eoghain (Owen's little rocky hill). The site is operated by Shannon Heritage.\n\n\n== Castle ==\nCraggaunowen Castle was built around 1550 by John MacSioda MacNamara, a descendant of Sioda MacNamara, who built Knappogue Castle in 1467.It was left in ruins in the 17th century, and rendered uninhabitable by the removal of the roof and staircase, and indefensible by removal of the battlements, at the time of the Cromwellian confiscations around 1653.The Tower House remained a ruin until it and the estate of Cullane House across the road, were inherited in 1821 by \"Honest\" Tom Steele, a confederate of Daniel O\u2019Connell, \"The Liberator\".Steele had the castle rebuilt as a summer house in the 1820s and he used it, and the turret on the hill opposite, as places of recreation. His initials can be seen on one of the quoin-stones to the right outside. Following his death in 1848 the lands were divided, Cullane going to one branch of his family, Craggaunowen to his niece Maria Studdert. Eventually, having passed through the hands of his descendants, the castle and grounds were acquired by the \"Irish Land Commission\". Much of the poor quality land was given over to forestry and the castle itself was allowed to fall into disrepair.By the time of the First Ordnance Survey in the 1840s, the castle was \"in ruins\" again. In the mid-19th century, the castle, herd's house and 96 acres were reported in the possession of a Reverend William Ashworth, who held them from a Caswell (a family from County Clare just north of Limerick). In 1906, a mansion house here was owned by Count James Considine (from a family based at Derk, County Limerick).Craggaunowen Castle was restored by John Hunt in the 1960s. Hunt added an extension to the ground floor, which for a while housed part of his collection of antiquities. The collection now resides in the Hunt Museum in the city of Limerick.\n\n\n== The Living Past Experience ==\nThe open-air museum was started by John Hunt. It features reconstructions of ancient Irish architecture, including a dolmen, a crannog, and the currach boat used in Tim Severins recreation of \"The Voyage of St. Brendan the Abbot\". It also shows reconstructions of a Ringfort, Fulachta Fia (Bronze Age cooking and industrial site) and Standing Stone (Ogham Stone).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Craggaunowen at Wikimedia Commons\n\nShannon Heritage: Craggaunowen",

          "This site has a small, restored castle, reconstructions of bronze and Stone Age villages and also the Brendan boat in which Tim Severin sailed the Atlantic. We found it fascinating and definitely worth persevering when you\u2019re trying to find it - it wasn\u2019t that well signed. There",
          "There are some nice castles to tour in Ireland...this is not one of them. There is not a whole lot to see here and my guess is you will wish you had not spent the money.",
          "this is a very fascinating place to visit for all ages, especially young ones, as they will learn so much about early Irish history.",
          "Lovely way to spent hour or so. Informative with handy pamphlet though could do with a revamp with numbers and map on front cover. Needs to be advertised better but worth the journey off the beaten track.",
          "We visited recently as a group of 10 , adults , teens and kids . We had nice weather which always helps . The visit takes about 2 hrs and is basically an outdoor reconstruction of life in pre Christian and early Christian Ireland . It is set in beautiful woodland and well",
          "Our whole family was impressed with this well cared for open air museum. I had been worried that it might be \"cheesy\" but instead it offered a wooded walking path that takes you though various eras of Irish history. It is lovingly maintained and the staff are passionate about",
          "I would recommend Craggaunowen to any family or historical enthusiast. There is plenty for all to do, between seeing old dwellings, sword fights, nice walks and a bit of Irish history to boot. Very reasonable prices too.",
          "Don\u2019t know why but I had never heard about Craggaunowen till a friend suggested we head for a visit with 5 kids under 8 on a road trip from Cork - allow 2 hours. We spent 3.5 hours there and would have stayed a bit longer only irish weather moved us on. The whole place is like",

          "We came thinking there would be lots of interaction. There was not. The huts were nice and beautifully recreated. They were, however, vacant. The lack of live interaction really spoiled it for me. It\u2019s a lovely location but really only requires about an hour.",
          "It was not what was expected, I thought there would be more to do and see , there are supposed to be people doing things like they did hundreds of years ago, there was only one woman spinning yarn, she was great to talk with and knowledgeable but that was all we saw for",

          "We did not tour the castle house, but did see the ring fort and other huts where the bronze-age experimentation was going on. Had a great tour guide who explained the ongoing research of making tools the way they did back then and using them to live and better understand the",

          "We visited on a Thursday in May. Weather was great. Exhibits were nice but needed more explanation than just the info plaques. We were told there would be interpretive guides in the park but we saw no one the whole time. Left with many unanswered questions. Not worth the 11 euro",
          "This wonderful site is a reenactment of Ireland's ancient past. There are replicas of the ancient dwellngs of the Celts, round forts, and a replica of Brendan's curragh, a skin covered boat which may have traveled to the New World before the Vikings and Columbus.",
          "An interesting ring fort if you want to know what life was like for people in the Bronze Age? Part of a Bronze Age village, close to the 16th Century Craggaunowen Castle, this is an example of a Crannog, which was how people lived in Ireland some 1,000 years ago. It a Celtic",

          "Craggaunowen is a most worthwhile visit as it recreates via restoration and reconstruction earlier forms of life and living on the island of Ireland during the pre-historic and early Christian eras. This was the brainchild of late John Hunt who was an expert on Mediaeval Art and",
          "This is not the best folk park or history park I've ever seen, but it is pleasantly laid out through the forest near the towns of Bunratty & Quin in Ireland. It was a lovely afternoon walk, we learned a number of things, saw the Brendan boat - cool got me since I'd read the",
          "Spent a few hours here today and it was well worth it! Beautiful forested walks with occasional well presented views of a working ring fort, crannog and a reconstructed tower house. No tour buses, we had the place to ourselves!",

          "Amazing way to spend a few hours going back in time and learning more about the history of our area. Really enjoyed the trip and found it so interesting. Would definitely recommend visiting it - a great place for kids to run around and to learn how our ancestors lived. Will",

          "A visit that offered a completely authentic experience. Suitable for both adults and children which allowed you to enjoy the visit at your leisure within your own time frame. Totally amazing",
          "Set in a truly picturesque place. Tree's all around the area , it is an historical site with wild boar and lake islands. The guide's were great , seemed a bit pricey but was surprised how varied and big an area it was, well worth the price",
          "I visited here today with my husband and nine year old daughter. It was absolutely lovely! I had been here on a school tour over 30 years ago and usually when you return to a place like that it can be a little disappointing as memory can make it seem better than it actually",

          "A wonderful experience wandering the site which shows how early Irish settlers and locals would live their lives over 1000 years ago..Plenty of guides to answer any query you may have. Also sited there is a small boat used to cross the Atlantic to replicate St Brendans voyage to",

          "I cannot recommend Craggaunowen highly enough! The living history is absolutely wonderful, you get to see what a community and living in the Iron Age might have really looked like and the actor/guides in each area are what really make this place special. The more you engage and",
          "Wow, this is one of my favourite places I have visited in Ireland. The forest walk is just the best, we spent two hours here walking and connecting with the Irish countryside. The Crannog has been so well put together and the Castle is great. So authentic and beautiful here.",
          "They have done a wonderful job of preserving and recreating what is essentially an outdoor museum. Visitors can set their own pace wandering through prehistoric dwellings, a castle, and a replica leather-clad ship from the 1970s. It is all fascinating and well worth 2-4 hours",
          "Always interesting. Good actors and demonstrations. Pretty locations to walk and take a picnic or get a cup of tea in the cafe. Definitely worth visiting.",
          "Very nice place to spend few hours with family. If you are lucky to have nice weather it is even better ;) I would like to see some 'upgrades' as I think this place did not change in last 10 years. Worth a visit if you are around or live close to it.",
          "lovely little trip through the ages, lovely little castle, not too much walking, but very scenic little setting, even the toilets were lovely, the shop nice and animals, souterrain, so cool, well worth the entrance fee (id go again). we had a picnic after the walk (only takes",

          "First of all the location is wonderful, since the park is located in the woods. The castle was not very big, smaller than the close-by famous castle, but the prehistoric village was very interesting. Also walking in the woods was a lovely experience.",
          "We got a bit lost getting here, as it is a bit off the main road, but what a lovely place! It is a living history of life thousands of years back, with some very knowledgeable guides. We enjoyed our day exploring and learning.",
          "Last time I was here must've been 32 years ago with the school tour. Again it did not disappoint. In fact I really enjoyed it. Saint Brendans boat was very interesting. It was early season so there was nobody there only one lady in the castle spinning wool. I felt because of",

          "We really enjoyed this site. There was a lot to see, read, and learn about the groups of people who inhabited this area long ago. The site is laid out very well, easy to access, and information is clearly provided. It's great on a nice day!",
          "On our way across Ireland, I thought it would make sense to see this reconstruction of a prehistoric site, where families lived on man-made islands in lakes or bog areas to have a defensive perimeter. Very well done project.",
          "We really came to just see the castle. We didn't realize that there was a trail system with a few minor things to check out. The boat and castle were interesting, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it again.",
          "Had been there on a school trip many moons ago and underground escape tunnel always stayed in my mind.Its not very long but for sure kids love the idea.Our boys are 6 and loved it.History part of tour not really appeal to 6 year olds though!We will go back when they are",

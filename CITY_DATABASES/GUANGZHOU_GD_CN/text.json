          "This is one of my favorite places to visit in Guangzhou and is a must see for any visitors I take around the city. It is easily accessible by Metro or taxi. The ornate Chinese architecture and Chen family artifacts would be enough in itself to see. However, there are many",
          "Great for people who are into a bit of history and the arts. Loads of different rooms and displays showing all the different art forms, and the English translations on the info boards are refreshingly good. Lovely green area to sit and relax at the back, the shop isn't as"

          "Considering I just came from Shanghai Disneyland, this theme park is bliss. Fast rides requires a minimum height of 1.4m, and thus there are no children in many queues. Queue time was on average 5-20 minutes tops, skip the express pass. If you are a family with small kids, there",
          "It's Sat and near summer holiday, quite a crowd. Bought 2 boys. One is above 1.4m and the other is not. The min height for the exciting rides is 1.4m. So there are some rides that my younger boy is not able to take. There's quite a number of thrilling rides that adults will",

          "We were lucky to go on a day that the park was empty. A few good roller coasters. With the high speed bike one and the highest one being a highlight. I think there was a little of everything for everyone. A full day's adventure. Children I think can get a lot out of this park",
          "We went just before the schools broke up in China, but it was an amazing summer's day, completely clear skies but not too hot. There were plenty of rides which were all open-no random closed attractions without notice, like in many theme parks in the UK and other places I've",

          "Really worth visiting if you are in Guangzhou and you like the roller coasters. The size of the seats is limited, so if you are an overweight person, you can't get it, even if you can get in the roller coasters in the USA. And they have the First Aid Office right when you get",

          "Great day out especially for teenagers. Most rides have a height restriction, but the entry price is also based on height, so if your kids have to pay full (adult) price, they will be able to go on all the rides. Most rides are up there with the best thrill rides, but they do",
          "We traveled with our 4 year old, but it really has lots for kids of all ages. It is a pleasant walking distance from the metro train station. It was not too crowded even on Saturday. The parade was incomparable to Disney, but still not too bad. The map (handout at entrance) can",

          "A range of rides, including children friendly attractions and looping, water rollercoasters, plus special events such as Halloween and festivals etc. Well worth a visit especially if open late when queues are very short or non-existent and would wait hours if it were a theme",
          "This park has amazing roller coasters and rides but shockingly few guests! I went there on a holiday weekend expecting it to be rammed with people, instead, the ride operators had to wait for more people before they would start each ride. I have been several times at several",

          "The visit was suggested as a time - out from the business side of the trip and it was worth it. I believe getting there early (around 09.00 on a Tuesday) made all the difference as the crowds were not bad at all, without the usually seen weekend throngs and we spent no longer",
          "Many of the X-games are exciting, especially they have 2 roller-coasters and it feels excited even when looking. The shows are very very good as well, and they have the new 5D movie. Magic show is good.",
          "We had a great time at Chimelong. We stayed in the adjoining hotel, went to the amusement park, and then saw the circus that night. The park was fun and loaded with great rides. And the circus was the best entertainment I've seen in years! Great stuff!",
          "Impression is amazing! Circus, park and zoo are very interesting for children and adults who want to feel like children. :) Beautiful decoration, different entertainments and performances. One day is not enough to see everything.",
          "This is the best theme park I have ever been to. The dive coaster was amazing, I promised myself to keep my eyes open but the scariest part is the slow journey all the way to the top where you can slowly start to see more and more of chinas horizon, then they stop the ride right",

          "We have a season pass, and have been many times. As an adult, the roller coasters are awesome. Dive coaster and 10 inversion are great fun, but it's mostly for the kids. My 8 y/o son always has a great time. He loves the bumper cars, but unless it's early or he has an express",
          "This is certainly one of the most enjoyable amusement park I have visited in China. It is easily accessible by MRT and has a wide range of rides. The park was not crowded during my visit on Monday, although there were many school children in uniform. Every rides required no more",
          "The rides come from reputable, Western manufacturers, not like the cheap, Chinese knockoffs that other parks are filled with. The park is clean, with friendly staff and plenty to do. Also, unlike the Happy Valley chain, they operate things efficiently and don't keep lines",
          "Great for kids above 140cm - they can go on every ride they have. We went with a 10 year old at 145 cm and an adventurous, thrill-seeking 7 year old who is just over 130cm tall. He could only go on one slightly exciting rollercoaster. There were 7 or more of the bigger rides he",

          "Chimelong paradise's 2 main attractions did not disappoint with thrill levels at all. The Giant Dive and The Ten Inversion Coaster were definitely worth the price of admission (200 RMB) alone, my friend and I rode them multiple times. Even with many schools being on site the day",
          "Even with thousands of young kids everywhere, the Chimelong Paradise was a very good experience. A good 10 inversions rollercoaster and another one with a 90\u00ba fall that was really good for rollercoaster lovers.",
          "A very nice park! I always try to fit in an amusement park when I'm around and this was quite special as it had \"clones\" of other big hit rides spread around the globe. I only do adrenaline rides and the ones available here are quite good to be honest. Getting there was easy",
          "I don't know if this is still the case, or if it is normal, but when I first visited Guangzhou, my friend took me here and there were so few people that there was no wait time on any of the rides. That being said, I don't know how much revenue they have to spend on",

          "A great park in all the means. We loved it! There are very amusing attractions and shows. We had much fun there, especially in the water attractions. The price is comparatively low and one can stay there for the whole day. The only drawback is queues. But if you visit it on a",
          "It has been a long time since I saw a circus. And what a show this was! The acts were of a very high standard and the human performers displayed superb showmanship. The animal acts were of a high standard too. The lightings and sound system are fantastic. There are also special",
          "I was there on 24th August 2013. Wow, what a queue when we got there even though we were more about 45 mins earlier. Nevertheless, once the show started, all the waiting game was over. The show was fantastic. The animals' performance were so cute and when the acrobats",
          "I had a chance to visit the Chimeling International Circus in Guangzhou. There are two shows-one at 5:30pm and one at 8pm. The whole experience was a superb spectacle of colour, light, circus, acrobats, music and animals. It does bring out the child in oneself. A must see",
          "I love amusement park rides and there were some rides / roller coasters here that I had never seen anything like before in my life! One of my favorites is a giant circle that everyone sits on which rotates while being swung on a giant pendulum. It was surreal! There are",
          "This is a lovely park, which is well looked after. Lots of trees and shady areas with an abundance of flowers in well kept garden areas. Some great coasters including a good dive coaster. Other rides are also good. I liked the Ice Age 3d show even if it was in Chinese. People",

          "I went from Guangzhou South Railway station to Chimelong by the free shuttle bus. The park itself is well kept and features a good range of attractions. The roller coasters are good and unique. The dive coaster was definitely the best and intimidating just to look at! The stunt",

          "The large park is comprised of two parts, one is a coach tour to see wild animals on the loose, another to explore by yourselves at leisure. Both parts are enjoyable and will take a whole day (at least the best part of a day) to visit. Whilst it is not quite safari as in",

          "My wife and I visited the park on a Monday. We were warned that the park is swarmed on weekends. The theme park delivered well above our expectations. The rides are categorized into adult and child by height, and the adult rides are quite fun. The food choices are good, and",
          "Been a couple of times as I live near to this fun park. First place I think of to go when friends and family visit. When I first had the chance to go here I was reserved as many places lack attention to detail in China. Chimelong really can rival others around the world.",
          "Sadly the day we visited the rain was a little in and off and so we weren't able to make full use of all the rides. The park holds the rollocoaster with the worlds steepest incline - and wow, it looks terrifying! Not being a rollocoaster lover I did not try it, but I chose some",

          "It is a very nice amusement park for children of all ages and a must see in Guangzhou! Just bring your own food if not familiar with Chinese food and avoid visiting in Summer. Lots of water games, so be ready to go wet :) If you buy a raincoat, do not trow it away after the game",
          "I was in in Guangzhou with a friend for 3 days so spent a whole day at Chimelong Paradise - it was definitely worth it! The big rides were amazing - the Dive Coaster and 10 Inversion Roller Coaster being my favourite! I went on a couple of times as there was almost no line up!",
          "The amusement park is nice, clean and well organized !!! I'm impressed !! However.. Chimelong's management could upgrade the staffs in order to be able to speak english (so at least most of them could speak bilingual languages); If they do that I will give them a five stars",
          "Went to the amusement park last weekend, and i must say....im speechless...! it was nice , the coasters and rides are just thrilling...except for the fact that theres long queues..you have to wait in line for like 45mins to 1hr...its crazy, so by the end of the day you only end",

          "Don't expect too much! If you've never watched circus before, it's worth to go. Once in a lifetime.",
          "it has more than six grand spectacular roller coasters there and you can have so much fun. but i found it's like a copycat from the busch garden in the states.",
          "This place really surprised me , i did not expect so professional environment. thought it was one of those local theme parks. But wrong. It is big , professional , entertaining . A must visit place in GZ if you have time for fun",
          "Well, it is no Disney Land, but it has some awesome wild rides. It has rides that other theme parks don't have. There is this one ride called Motorbike Coaster. It may only be a short ride experience, but definitely worth the wait! Instead of the usual sitted position, you are",
          "About 1/2 taxi ride outside the centre is this great theme park. 200RMB entrance. There are rides for all the family, various shows and some great thrilling roller-coasters. Some of the best I have been on in a long time! Well worth a day trip",
          "This park has some good rollercoaster rides if you like that kind of thing, me I am like a big kid so it was great tto try the different rides. Also is a very nice park to walk around, clean and tidy and was a good day. There is a show in the main theatre that is well worth a",
          "Chimelong Paradise is an amusement park located in Guangzhou. The good thing about this park is that the activities in the park are very fun to play and there are many of them. There is a water park and a land area to play. So you can enjoy both at the same time or just stay in",
          "We only went to the water park, which was in a surprisingly nice area. We visited during a weekday. Park was not too crowded. Some rides had quite a long line. For Tornado they filling up the tubes (4 persons), which meant we as a party of 3 had to wait some time for a single",

          "I went on a Sat in jan and found there to be no queues at all, this was great as we could do many of the rides multiple times. The range of rides was good with a few white knuckle as well as more family orientated ones. I wasn't too keen on the food served here but that is a",
          "THis is a great amusement park, and is not a cheesy, ghetto Chinese theme park. It is very Western in how it looks, and feels and has awesome rides. But it does not have any decent Western food, so bring in something to eat or you may starve as we did. Seriously, nothing edible",
          "Chimelong is Guangzhou's answer to Disney World. It is funky, very Chinese, and at times unsettling (the zoo has its ups and downs) but fascinating. The zoo has a very interesting white tiger feeding demonstration and a number of pandas (they were even awake!). The circus is a",
          "Many exciting and fast rides. With our young children, we stayed with ground level rides and those tend to be a bit older. Don't expect too much and you'll feel better. The shows are good. The stunt show is great, but it could get very loud. We brought earplugs.",

          "Very lively place to relax with friends.... We were 5 people in group and had a lot of fun. The rides are quite thrilling.",
          "Good, but not great, for be in China. Can not compare amusemant parks with the western world, but sure you can have a nice day here. It is not Disney, but it is a amusement park. Only 200 rmb.",
          "Chimelong is a real fun place in the Guangzhou region. We got the metro from yuexiu park and it took 50 mins and cost us like 6rmb. Don't bother waiting for the shuttle once u get to hangxi changlong station as it's a 150m walk to the south gate. Prob best to get an english",

          "We had a day to burn in Guangzhou. Our hotel room had a travel guide, so we found the Chimelong Paradise Resort with a theme park that looked like fun. Fun, yes - to a degree, a couple of rides to entertain adults, a water show that was in Chinese and hardly any english speaking",
          "We visited Chimelong Paradise last May 27, 2010. It was fun, there are many types of rides for people of different convictions and varying risk adversities. Any one from age 5- 45 years old have a ride to try , no unnecessary benching, no excuse not to try even one. There are",

          "This may be worth visiting again in the future, but right now it's not at its best. The pagoda is under renovation, and is blocked off, so you can only look at it from a distance. There are other temple buildings in the complex that are worth a look, and some are very old (or",
          "The temple & surrounds are quite peaceful but, sadly, the pagoda is being restored and was heavily covered. Probably better to wait until works are completed.",
          "The pagoda is being renovated & much is covered with awning and scaffolding, so it could be a \"see next time\" spot.",
          "If you are around six banyan tree temple and have enough time maybe its not bad choice. If you are planing to visit temple i say dont waste your time",
          "Worth a visit, as the grounds house several small temples and the pagoda which is pretty but not astoundingly large, and true to its namesake, beautiful and majestic banyan trees. It's a peaceful spot. Beware the aggressive monks looking for money on the surrounding streets",
          "In such an industrial city, this is probably one of the few places to visit in Guangzhou that has a cultural background. The place its nice and well maintain but the lack of authenticity in the construction its quite evident. On the other hand, its very easy to reach and it has",
          "The temple itself is a bit of a let down, as there really isn't much left. There are a couple of halls and the rather nice pagoda. It is a pity that you can't go inside the pagoda, but it is worth a look. For only 5 rmb, it won't break the bank.",
          "I enjoyed visiting the temple and it is important to be there with a guide that can explain the symbols and meanings. The pagoda is closed for climbing but photogenic.",
          "For RMB 10 (~1.5 USD), it is worth stopping in to see the temple and pagoda (flower pagoda is pictured here). Originally built in 537, it has been rebuilt several times, and the name has also been changed several times. During holidays and festivals, it can be quite busy but",
          "Entrance fee was RMB10 for adults and free for elderly. Place is smaller than expected and finished visiting it in 15 mins. Only special thing is the pagoda but no entry is allowed.",
          "Was there to witness the local temple ceremony. There is an entrance fee of 5 yuan. Love the Pagoda.",
          "This is a nice, clean and serene temple to visit in Guangzhou. I went there as part of a tour so only spent a small amount of time there. The grounds were very nice and peaceful. Very good architecture and a nice place for contemplation. Worth a visit.",
          "This is a peaceful little temple, popular with locals coming to give offerings of incense and flowers. It's nice to get away from the crowds for a while, but the pagoda is closed off to the public.",
          "I've been there yesterday and it was definitely one of the best temples in Guangzhou. Really beutiful place, close to Ximenkou metro station (like 10 minutes walk) ...and also very cheap (ticket costs 5cny:)",
          "Liurong Temple is one of the most inspirational places I've visited. Rich in history (with its founder, philosopher and Buddhist monk, Huineng, dating back from the Song dynasty) - the temple shows a large complex of different halls and ancient trees. Highly recommended for",
          "Nice to see a quiet place in a city with a lot of noise and people everywhere. Interesting pagodas and lovely Buddhist shrines and statues.",
          "It was a little hard to find as my guidebook said \" Exit B\", but there is no exit B at GuanYuanQian Metro! It turned out to be exit I2, go straight ahead for 2 blocks and turn right into LiuRong Rd. A typical small temple with a large pagoda, and three quite impressive bronze",
          "If you think that you can enter the tower which we did you will be disappointed. There are several (4) halls with bid Budda statutes but that's all...",
          "I'm a huge fan of traditional Chinese culture and this place was just fantastic. It was well-maintained and offered lots of opportunities. The environment is clean and relaxing and the attending monks were courteous and allowed us to photograph the temple at out leisure.",
          "Unfortunately it was pouring with rain when I arrived in Guangzhou. So when Ivisted here it was a rush through as most of the things you want to have a look at, you are going to get soaked standing there. The surrounds and temples are nice and the Pagoda is impressive. It was",
          "Rich in history and architecurally charming, the pagoda is well worth a visit. Just wandering around the grounds makes you feel relaxed and at peace which is welcomed after roaming the streets of Guangzhou!",
          "A great historic place to visit.. Worth the trip. The entrance is only 5RMD per person and you can spend as much time as you like looking around the grounds. The Buddhist temples are abundant and extraordinary.. once exiting and at the top of the street you will find yourself",
          "it was quite difficult to find this place until i had it written in cinese and took a taxi... (quite a problem in China that taxi drivers cannot read but only in cinese....) but the place is really worth it! it seems like a small oasis in the middle of this chaotic city.",
          "A pretty little temple in a nice neighborhood. A bit hard to find, though. Quiet, serene, a good place to just take a breather and relax in the midst of hectic GZ. Signs are mostly Chinese with a bit of Chinglish; a few are actually in English.",
          "This Temple is surrounded by a park-llike area. The actual temple is closed and you cannot go in ...but it is breathtaking. They do have new temples near it where people can go in and they have some beautiful pieces inside. The monks live in a building in the park area.",
          "Im in Guangzhou for 2 days and this was the highlight of my visit! Easy get to by tube, bigger then I thought with multiple buildings to visit. Well worth the trip, such bueatiful place,the air is full of insence!",
          "The temple has a history of thousand year and was renamed by famous poet Su Tong Bo. The temple has a very rich history and if you like historial place, the temple is worth for the visit. when you are out of the MTR, following the temple exit, cross the street and turn right on",
          "This place is very peaceful & beautiful, would definitely recommended going if your interested in temples & Buddhism, The 3 big bronze statues are very impressive & the pagoda is HUGE! But you can't go up it. The walk to the temple from the metro stop is quite confusing, make",
          "The temple is rich in culture,history and difficult to find. The old streets and high buildings surrounding it hide the location. Be patient. Only 4RMB to enter and the experience is priceless. We witnessed one of the brothers with several worshipers offering prayers. Talk about",
          "You have to pay to enter but it's cheap. (I think it's only 5 rmb, not sure.) The temples and building inside are beautiful. I'd like to recommend this place for someone who... - interesting in religion - interesting in Chinese culture - want to visit the temple for religious",
          "Take metro line 2 to Gongyuanqian Station and walk towards exit B. Make a U turn upon exit B and walk about 8 mins along some shops. At a cross junction traffic light, turn left and walk for another 5 mins. Open from 0800 to 1830. Admission only CNY5.",
          "This temple is quite far from the subway. You need to walk or take taxi to get there. The limited sign made me asked for the direction. FYI: They speak Cantonese. To visit this temple you need to pay RMB5. It is similar with some temples that I have visited before in Indonesia.",
          "It took us about 25 minutes via cab to get to the Six Banyan Temple from our hotel which was near the Canton Tower. We thought it was worth the drive. There are three very large Buddha statues that are very stunning. I read that these are the largest and oldest bronze Buddhas",
          "Unfortunately, the tower was closed. However, I don't know if it was only that day or week or for good. Still worth to see and take some pics :)",
          "We really enjoyed visting the temple and pagoda. We especially enjoyed the Buddha statues and icons and the history of the site. As a special bonus, our newly-adopted Chinese son was blessed by a Buddhist priest in the temple. It was an unforgettable experience.",
          "the temple building is very nice. architecture and art is a good cultural.",
          "Walked here from Beijing Lu along zhong shan lu, very interesting walk. It was not clear from the tourist map we had which street the temple was on but we asked people (liu rong si, and hand gestures for a temple for any english speakers) and managed to find it. 5RMB per adult",
          "I would recommend this to anyone visiting Guangzhou. It's really interesting to see this side of China and we had a great time there.",
          "Although you can go to the temple it's closed for renovation ahead of Guangzhou hosting the Asia Games in 2010.",
          "I found this temple worth the trip. The three budda's alone make it fantastic. A nice change of pace in this busy city.",
          "The highlight of this particular Buddhist temple is the 57 metre high Flowery Pagoda, rebuilt in 1097 after the establishment of the temple in AD 537. It's a reasonably strenuous climb up the seventeen levels (there are mezzanine levels between each of the nine outside"

          "Guangzhou us known for its maddening crowds, especially on weekends, but there is so much space at the Botanical Gardens, you may forget where you are for awhile. The stars of the Garden are its many greenhouses (which you need to pay for separately or at the time you get your",
          "This botanical garden is very large, with a variety of plants, suitable for bringing children to know plants together, and suitable for women who like taking photos.I saw this attraction above the small WeChat program Canton Laowai",
          "This garden has a lovely collection of tropical plants, spread over a large area. Just a 5 minute walk to the subway, which is incredibly easy to use, so very accessible. I've been to several botanical gardens over the years, but never a tropical one! We started with the very",
          "Note that there\u2019s a trolley that circles the entire park where it costs only 10 RMB per person to ride the trolley where you can get on & off at your leisure, though the driver expects you to leave after you\u2019ve made your way around the entire park.",
          "Mostly local families were in the park/garden during our walk through. There is a play area, where many families had gathered. From a botanical gardens standpoint, it might be a little better than average, but not outstanding.",
          "The Southern China Botanical Garden is really nice and pristine. We had a really nice walk in the nature on a rather cool day in Guangzhou.",
          "In early May, the garden was mostly dark, lush green. Less than 5% of the trees and plants were in bloom. Of the various sections of the garden, I most enjoyed the Tropical rainforest Conservatory, the Desert Plant Conservatory, and watching the Koi fish scramble for food as",
          "Well if you like to be outdoors then this is another nice place to venture out for a walk, like I did. The weather had sobered down and with the sun shining it offers a perfect getaway to be in nature. Lots of nice flowers and tall trees lined up. Avoid using your phone and",
          "I went with a local friend, who had come before in the summer but not the colder months. We got admission to the greenhouses besides the general gate ticket, and that was a neat area to walk in with more reading available. There was also an area called \u201cfirst village\u201d that had",
          "The botanical garden itself is quite large with but a few varieties of plants. Its landscape is poorly managed with the exception of few viewpoints. The conservatory area closes at least 30 minutes prior to the time indicated on the tickets and there is no staff around to",
          "We enjoyed a good 3 1/2 hours there and it was not too crowded at all. Optional admission fee allowed us to enter the 3 glasshouses. They were fantastic. Some air-conditioned enclosures within to replicate the alpine temperature of the plants displayed. There were seriously",
          "We were so fortunate to be able to catch part of a highlights tour around the 4 greenhouses. It was led by a volunteer and started fr 3.30pm, but we joined half way from 430pm. Tours are conducted in Chinese. It was golden week, and these free tours were organized on a daily",
          "For China, this is a better-than-average botanical garden intended to show off a collection of sub-tropical plants. There are a series of glass houses that provide tropical moist habitat for plants, and there is also an arid glasshouse. There is a big collection, but many of the",
          "The grounds are well kept but the greenhouses have seen better days I'm afraid. Can get a 20 RMB ticket or 50 RMB combo. I recommend the later. Located right next to botanical garden metro station. I enjoyed it. Killed a couple of hours",
          "Nice place, about 7 minutes walk from the metro station Botanical Garden, two types of tickets: 20 rmb for garden only, 50 rmb for garden and greenhouses. The last one worth its price. The park is well maintained, in the greenhouses there are proper translation in English",
          "I spent an hour walking around the botanical garden and didn't find it to be that amazing. The park wasn't well maintained. Compared to the Xianhu Botanical Gardens in Shenzhen, it was a big disappointment. If you're into gardening or enjoy nature, the Xianhu Botanical Gardens",
          "If you love nature, and trees, you have to visit this place. It will be a memorable experience to visit this attraction.",
          "been here several times and back, indoor and outdoor botanical gardens with wide lanes and actaully we never have seen this venture overcrowded like other places.",
          "South China Botanic Garden has so much to see. The large glasshouse was so impressive and it was amazing to see the diversity of different species both inside and out.",
          "As a zoologist, I wasn't REALLY interested in the plants (but they were awesome too!); I was interested in the fauna (insects) that live on or near plants. There was plenty of different species of butterflies etc., fish, birds and I saw a snake swimming across a pond. I also",
          "These gardens are very large with diverse holdings! The size also reduces any \"crowding effects\"!! Like Kew Gardens [in London} the size of the plant/ tree and flower collections is staggering!! Then there are the more specialised greenhouses [where there are flowering plants",
          "I've been to the gardens before, in crisp autumn weather, which was a nice time to go. The park is huge with a lot of interesting dedicated garden areas, some of them quite huge in themselves. You pay Y50 extra to visit the greenhouses, which I did not really think worth the",
          "Park with great assortment of plants from throughout the world a la Kew. Large hothouses: especially good are the rainforest and desert houses. Let down by litter and cigarette ends all over, and the gardens could do with more maintenance. But if you keep your eyes on the plants",
          "You can find some flowers in any season. When we are there, the tea flowers are blooming together with a type of tree full of purple flowers. Place is big so taking the electric car is definitely recommended.",
          "We visited on 16 Nov 2016 weather was perfect. Feels good again to take a nice long walk amidst the greenery, something that is quite rare in a fast paced society where we rush for work all the time. We took a cab from tianhe district paying rmb 42. Had lunch there at a Chinese",
          "We went on a very humid near-rainy day. It was hot and very wet but we rented a pedal-cart thing, rode around the entire park, sweated our butts off and enjoyed ourselves. Lots of lovely greenery and riding around was a lovely way to experience it, breezy and speedy, however we",
          "Do not miss out on this place if you get half a day, make sure you see the conservatory/greenhouses. I will remember it forever. it's very well maintained, I suggest catching the bus around the gardens to main locations you want to see on the map, the place is huge !",
          "Yesterday we visited the south botanical garden and I just can say it's worth the entrance fee. This park is not so crowded like the rest I saw and much more clean. There you can forget the hectic of the big city for a moment and relax. The greenhouses are nice, the extra fee",
          "The park is in the city but you don't feel the hectic inside, it's good for a walk or picnic. Don't rent those 4 wheal bicycle, those one are very hard to ride and after short time you just want to return it. You go there once is enough. You can skip this part without missing",
          "Nice green space, good for a break from the city. Conservatories disappointing, not worth the additional entry fee. Unfortunately like most gardens in china, started with ambitions, but lacks maintenance",
          "Butterflies - I visited here in the autumn and saw more butterflies here in their natural surroundings than I saw on BaiYun mountain. It is a little out of the way to get to. You can ride the metro as far as you can on line 6 and then walk the last 15 minutes (it is on the",
          "We spent close to 4 hours and really had wonderful time watching beautiful plants and flowers.I would reccomend to the tourist who are plant lovers",
          "A bit more to offer than most Chinese parks, the greenhouses are great and you can get a day of activity and exercise for the kids. No real food options. You can hire bikes to cycle round very cheaply.",
          "The botanical garden is a very huge place but you can take small buggy cars running in between the sights. Like always in China it is a problem to be understood but you can jump on the car and it takes you somewhere for sure. The flowers are beautiful and very colourful and the",
          "The botanic garden was a great experience for both my husband and myself. We loved seeing all the fauna and learning about what grows in china. The only bummer was that we were here when little was blooming. Still remarkably beautiful.",
          "Highly recommended. I just happened to stumble upon the place and I didn't regret it. I am, however a big fan of nature but regardless, it's a nice plan to check out if you're in the city.",
          "Peaceful natural place to walk through. Interesting plants and trees. Nice to get away from the hustle and bustle.",
          "this wonder in a big city is wel kept, clean and amazing wel assorted, looking at the guangzhou environment. been there several times, lived in guangzhou for almost 10 years, and went over and over just to go around, normal refreshments for sale, all clean and OK",
          "We did enjoy seeing the lily around the garden reminding me my own native home country. And the diversities of flowers. I loved also the foot walk in the palms around the garden",
          "This is one of the bests botanical gardens in the Asian territory with its tons of different species,plants and trees in its three different parts.Very easy to reach at by metro,get off at Tianhe Bus Station and then take one of the buses from there and get off at Botanical",
          "This botanical garden is well-maintained and managed. General and scientific information of flora and fauna are displayed prominently. It is an ideal place for family outing, children's educational tour, friends outing and entertaining guests. Plants and flowers are impressive",
          "Put this on your must see list while on holiday. I am in China often and like to visit different attractions ect Well worth a look",
          "Visited it again last Saturday for the Jade Vine. Really gorgeous colors and shapes! @ Greenhouse Fee: \uffe550 on site (you may purchase a ticket on some tourist website and it's only \uffe538)",
          "The botanical garden is located outside of the city of Guangzhou. The conservatory is especially beautiful, not only the plants and trees but the paths leading around them. I took two buses to get there, so allow plenty of travel time to get there and back. There's food",
          "Took the bus 775 to \u534e\u5357\u690d\u7269\u56ed with my friends. We found the place really peaceful and fresh. Maybe because we went there a week before Chinese New Year, so lots of people had already left Guangzhou to there hometown. I had a good time and indeed enjoyed the lack of people all around",
          "It's without doubt my favourite in Guangzhou!!! Visited it several times and each time I got surprises. Love shooting flowers especially, though I have no professional equipments. Every time I find a new flower that I never saw, it's such a great joy. Lawns, trees, rivers... all",
          "this city is full of buildings, its a forest of steel, but this garden in the middle of this city, you can break your day by going there and take a short walking to stay happy and fun, keep looking to the flowers and green spaces.",
          "Great place to add to your tour of the city. We had a great time walking around the Garden and seeing all the plants and trees that were different from the U.S. where we live.",
          "My parents and I visited the botanical garden several times every year. We walked along the paths in the woods and feel the freshest air. And we had lunches by the lake. We visited the garden several days consecutively. It's our favorite place.",
          "The concept of the garden reflects the three oceans, shown through lakes and the five continents through greenhouse buildings of which each stores the plants from one of the five continents. In February / March many plants are blooming and the beauty of the different colours",
          "We paid 50 yuan entrance fee each to see the greenhouse plants. If you do not want to take any photos of huge cactuses or a waterfall, then miss it and pay only 20 yuan. The air is so clean there. You feel like you are in a tropical rainforest. The park is very beautiful. If",
          "I visited these botanical gardens 2 summers ago. It was a science teacher's dream come true. Exhibits are organized by biomes. The desert biome had the largest collection of stone plants I have ever seen. Saw rare and exotic plants of Asia, including the face seed fruit tree -",
          "I've lived in Guangdong province for many years and had never heard of this place until a student alerted me to it. It should be much better known. Not quite up there with Kew, Singapore or Hamilton, NZ, but a very large and interesting collection none-the-less. In the humid",
          "We spent a weekend near the Guangzhou Science City, so decided to visit some greenery in the vicinity (15 mins radius). This Botonical Garden is said to be the 2nd largest one in China, indeed no joke. You may want to consider renting a bike inside, better if you can bring",
          "this park was so peaceful the trees where lovely so many di9fferent plants and flowers would have to stay all day and enjoy all the plants and you would be at peace just sitting here listening to the birds was a long trtip there but worth the trip well done china so pretty",
          "This is a very large complex, which would could easily take a whole day to cover. If you like interesting plants and exotic flowers, it's worth the trip. It's not as nice as others I have seen, but pretty good for China. The main greenhouse is huge, with fun elevated",
          "I took the driving test and get there, it's just a regular botanical garden, but you can enjoy it with your friends and peers as outdoor activity. Also, enjoy the natural Oxygen bar there.",
          "It a quiet place in Guangzhou.I think Spring is the best season visit this Garden and you can know more about this plants kingdom.BTW,my father had participated in designed this Botanical Garden many years ago,haha.But I think it's not easy to get there if you are in the city"

I would recommend you to visit one of the Chimelong Parks during the day and finish the day with this show. It's about 1 hour metro ride from Guangzhou.",

Shanghai\u2019s has a live band and the compound is smaller and more intimate so one feels more absorbed into the performance. Chimelong has animals in the circus. Taxi ride from Guangzhou cost",

          "We enjoyed this show very much. Do arrive early as it's free seating for the cheapest sector tickets. We took the free shuttle bus from the metro station to the circus venue. The pre show entertainment starts at 7 pm. A very enjoyable show not to be missed. Bought our tickets",
          "We picked GZ for a short vacation because of Chimelong Resort. The circus is fabulous, and entertaining, do not miss it! Seat wise, view is still good even off-centre because the stage is wide. You can choose to upgrade on the spot at the arena, so just purchase the normal seat",

          "This is one of the best circus shows I\u2019ve seen in a while. Very well presented. Great clowns and acrobats. We did not get to see the motorbikes in the caged ball due to a malfunction of the caged ball, but I\u2019m so more impressed by the fact that they took safety over anything",
          "This is probably the best circus that I have ever seen. The show lasted over an hour and there was never a dull moment. Best part were the animal acts and motorcycle show. Never saw performing hippos before. Also the bear acts were fabulous. Re the motorcycle show, they rode in",

          "The entire show was an impressive performance with amazing acrobatics, horse riders, spring-board divers and motor bike riders. Unlikely to see a circus like this anywhere else. The divers were great to watch and it was hilarious when they pulled a very unwilling crowd member up",
          "I attended the circus on the 30th of January and felt let down by the excessive and inhumane use of animals. The circus should have more confidence in their human performers and stop relying on the outdated use of animals! It\u2019s a real shame as the cast are clearly very hard",
          "I would combine the circus experience with staying at their hotel together with the safari. It would make a fun-filled 2-days program. As a hotel guest, you are given reserved seating in the blue section, refer to the map attached. Outside the VIP seating, i think the BEST",

          "Never a dull moment throughout the show. Daredevil stunts kept us on the edge of our seats. International cast. Animals were performing some of the tricks. I must say this was the best circus I have seen! It is the near South Gate of the Safari Park. The general ticket does not",
          "A great production. Awesome stage effects. I would have enjoyed the circus a lot more had there been no animals. Coming from S.Africa we are used to our animals in their natural habitat. It was sad & unnatural to see these animals perform tricks for our benefit. Minus the",
          "I enjoyed every movements they made.They don't waste every single second. A millions likes for the performance.",
          "It is well worth it. We bought regular tickets, I think section C, which is general admission everywhere except the first dozen or so rows. View was great, and a few parades travel through the seating area and the view from the more expensive seats did not have as good of a",
          "The big circus is a must-see, 90-minute performance, it\u2019s wonderful from start to finish! It is recommended to pay the vip position, facing the performers. The location of the first-class seats is also good, try to go early, the fourth or fifth row is more suitable, easy to",
          "They follow the same format and theme as Cirque de Soleil with the exception that they also have animals in the show. If you are from the USA and are against exploitation of animals for profit, then probably this is not the show for you to see. What I can say is the animals",
          "I enjoyed alot there which was very excited to see the place and how the circus dies I love seeing this and makes me so happy",
          "Wasn't an extraordinarily superb circus performance, but was good and fascinating nonetheless. Apart from the VIP section, this show is free-seating, so it's advisable to wait for the doors to open and get the seat you'd like especially if you're travelling with a big",

          "I just hate and cannot tolerate to see these type of Animal Cruelty Show. The show performance by human, trained and professional, that\u2019s good. However, I hope using an animal in cuircus, treated and torturing should bebanned sooner than any later, this show made me sick...",

          "Cycling monkeys, rope acrobats and daredevil with heavy balls, this circus does not disappoint. If you\u2019re in GZ, this is a MUST visit. There are tons of reviews on the line up already and thus I will be primarily sharing my experience in normal, first class and VIP seats.",
          "Attended this circus since they have stopped most of them in the US. This was a great event and really enjoyed the show. A wide variety of different acts and animals. I highly recommend seeing this circus.",
          "Good display of circus art which will excite the children. Overall a good experience for the entire family. Was there on a Monday and it was not too crowded. Understand that it can get very crowded over weekends.",
          "Bought discounted tickets for family on their website. Remember to check up different promotion before getting the tickets. The tickets are more expensive during peak season. We didn't expect the circus to be that good. It's really world-class standard. It's world cup season,",

          "The show is exceptional and intense !! You should be there at least 1h30min before beginning to get nice seat. The duration of the show is 1h15min which is a bit frustrating for the price but it\u2019s a great moment",
          "We spent 3 days in the Chimelong resort and on one of the days visited the circus. I must say that the kids and I thoroughly enjoyed the acrobatics, dancing and the stunts. What we did NOT enjoy was the use of animals. Without the animal acts this Circus is a great show.",
          "My wife and I decided to give the show a go over the CNY break and we were both awe struck and appalled at the same time. The Human component was spectacular, super talented people, fantastic set, lights, sound etc. a real theatrical treat. Sadly the Chimelong group still feel",

          "Finally got to see the well acclaimed Chimelong circus. Definitely full of great acts and great use of animals. Only 90 minute performance and lacked a lion or tiger act. I thought every good circus would have one. You need to get there more than an hour before showtime as seats",

          "Came with no expectations and really liked the show. A great mix of animals, fun clowns, acrobatics, water, fire and light. We paid 470 RMB for VIP tickets and it was worth the added experience of sitting center, first row.",

          "Really enjoyed the show. Good variety of acts. Ok, dancing bears were my favourite. The stadium is well appointed and comfortable - not your tent and wooden benches. Chimelong is an amusement complex with a Amusement Park, water Park and Zoo also. Can easily spend a day here.",

          "A extraordinary experience is waiting for you if you are planning to visit this place. The tricks and performances are really amazing. Only thing you have to consider is crowd at the place as it attracts too much crowd. You must buy your tickets well in advance (May be 3-4 hours",
          "I have been at Chimelong International Circus last night with my wife and my 2 daughters...and the only thing I can say is... simply amazing. The time of the show is from 7.30pm to almost 9 pm , a little bit late for small children but is worth to see.",
          "I anticipated a wholly boring circus night but it was quite contrary and exceeded my expectations. The padre of over 100 perfumers was excellent. There was trapeze performers, horses, monkeys, pelicans, eagles, flamingos, miniature horse, elephants, tigers, lions and the list",
          "If you a visiting Guangzhou this is a must attend show. i have been attending the show at least once a year for the last 4 years and it keeps getting better and better .",
          "Great circus with the full show on the cheap price. The transporation is convenience, you can take train to the destination and took the bus direct to the circus. I rate the show compare to price is great.",
          "We visited here in 2010 and again in 2015 and really enjoyed it. The performances, the clowns, the animals -- all was first rate and highly entertaining. It's a perfect venue for families, plus there's a nice restaurant next door and all kinds of souvenir shops. The acts do",
          "It was a very entertaining show. The animals made the show more interesting. Without the animals, it wouldn't be a circus. Take metro to Hanxi Chang Long, exit A, walk across the street by the overhead bridge and walk towards the car park where you will see a bus stop for the",
          "If you are in Guangzhou,must watch this show.Amazing acrobats by girls,boys and animals.It is well organised show but one thing missing is that there are no seat numbers.So better to go early to get good seats.It starts at sharp 7.30 pm and finishes at 9 pm. Make arrangements",
          "Stunning performance by artists and animals over an hour and a half. Sound effect and lighting are brilliant. I wad impreesed by the elephant shows on skipping rope and turning arpund with only one leg on a spinning chair. Other usual circus acts are of very high calibre. Seats",
          "The circus is very entertaining. All the attractions are very attractive. And it can suit all ages from young to old. The place is huge. A bit struggle to get a good seat because so many people and we need to line up early in order to get the good seat. The circus is worth to",
          "The place it's very nice it's in big place with nice hotel and resturante and safari zoo and water park we have a dinner in the same place then we go to the circo it was amazing many shows snd nice and many pepole in show it's funny we enjoy it I was with my Husbend and Friends",
          "Since, I have come to Gz , was planning to visit Chang long international circular but Jul-Aug is summer holiday time for China and thus could not get ticket online for weekend. Today decided to call their call centre and confirmed that they were running two shows one at 5 pm",
          "Visiting Guangzhou will not be complete without a trip to watch the Circus. We got our tickets at site, ard 6:30 pm, braved the huge crowd for about 40 minutes , since it was a Saturday, Summer in China. Since we went with our mom, we left the place 15 minutes before the show",
          "Wow! This circus was the show to put all other shows to shame, and we only saw 20 minutes of it! This show was worth the hassle of getting visas alone. They end this show with a magic illusion that involves a white tiger and the release of pelicans and doves. It's incredible!",
          "The Circus is in a permanent theater allowing extensive use of fantastic audio-visual techniques along with a huge variety of animals. Not to be missed if you have an evening free. It will take you back to your childhood.",
          "This circus took me back a few decades in time when I was a child and I thought about my first memories of going to the circus and boy, has global circus entertainment come a long way! I can see how Chang Long has appeal to its domestic audience. The human performers had amazing",
          "This is one of the great circus i ever seen. With lots of animal that being love by kids. When i was there,the atmosphere was amazing. Fully crowded!! U gotta be here when u go to chimelong!!",
          "I got there late and ended up in the 'nose bleed' seats at the top and on one side of the stage. I could still see quite well and even up there it was quite atmospheric- the audience really gets into the show! But if you want the really good, non-VIP seats, I saw people",
          "if you visit guangzhou, you have to see this place. this place is kinda like las vegas but also has it own unique points. for example, you can see the circuit and live in the hotel. this place is like a all inclusive resort",
          "Get a seat in the area where you pay for a dedicated seat! The show is pure 'Las Vegas', too much of everything- but worth it! Wham.....",
          "This has been in my to-do list when I visited Guangzhou and it did not disappoint. I was amazed with how animals and humans can live in peace and harmony (of course they were trained), it was really worth it to witness the show and will make you wanted to see more. I would love",
          "Super excellent circus, they put in different varieties from animals to clowns to acrobats and all the things they perform are simply amazing. Perfect for young ones, even though the opening could be a bit scary but later on they do enjoy all the different shows. Animals shows",
          "I came out with mixed feelings about this circus. The performances were spectacular, and diverse and the costumes and set were amazing. The lasers at the beginning were especially good and the whole thing was set to music. However I had some issue with the number of animals in",
          "Actually for the show that they provide, I would give a \"Very Good\" review. The performers put their heart on the show and performance was very good. Excellent I should say. However, looking at other aspect of the circus itself, I was a bit disappointed. It is branded as",
          "Amazing is not even enough to describe this circus show! I was hesitant at first but when I was informed that it will be an international group who will be performing and that it's a must-see attraction when you are in Guangzhou, I'm glad I did! My son and my nephew were in awe,",
          "I have been in many circuses shows world wide. My idea is to please my kids but I found it more pleasurable for me:) It is one of three goods circuses in the world that I have ever been",
          "acceptable traffic, you can take subway there. child must be excited with the place. yet the price is a little bit high. if you travel in the city, do miss it.",
          "We went to this circus because of the many good reviews. Unfortunately, I found the show itself very average. The start was promising with wonderful laser light effects. However, its novelty fizzles out after the first 5 minutes. What followed was a hodge-podge of acrobatic",
          "Ok, so the circus has animals, which I was uncomfortable with, but if we take the overall show, it was everything I imagined a circus to be. Loud, colourful, entertaining and amazing acrobatics and stunts Recommend you pay extra for the VIP seats. Otherwise it's first come first",
          "Not many circuses can boast of so many animals and performances in the same place! Really world class performers and acts!",
          "Just when here yesterday with 8 other members of my family. My grandma absolutely enjoy the one hour and half showtime. The circus performed by the animal is quite entertained and the acrobatic by russian guys are very entertaining.",
          "I thought the acrobatics in this show were phenomenal. All of the acts were jaw-droppingly good. The costumes were extravagant, the music was exciting and the performances were outstanding...Then they brought on the animals. It upset me and my friends to watch them and the show",
          "This place was full by the time the show started. There was no lull moment as there were some comic or side acts in between main acts. Elephants walking on hind legs, amusing. Bears almost running on hind legs, awkward. That circus act where they have a ring thst goes around",
          "Saw this show 2 times and still willing to go again. Well done. Most artists are foreigners. Try to reach there at least one hour before the start. Otherwise you won't get a nice seat. It's always crowded especially weekends.",
          "This location is very accessible for tourists - Take the metro (Orange Line 3) to Hanxi-Changlong station. After exiting the station, cross the bridge to the theme park and there is a free shuttle bus that will take you to the circus. Admission is charged per person regardless",
          "I went with a Scottish friend. Both of us were impressed by the quality of the show. It was worth of the price they charge. Do go in and grab a seat as early as you can, because good seats go very fast.",
          "Its a must see!Eye opening experience.Many shows to see,its an international circus.Its the best I've seen!",
          "Worth the time the money!! Best circus We had ever been to! Amazing acts, casts and soundtracks!! Take the train and they have free shutter bus to the site and come early to get the best seat.",
          "I wanted to like this show and I was really excited to see it because of all the good reviews here but I couldn't even maintain my focus for 15 minutes. What bothered me the most was the whole art direction that it is quite....cheap. The soundtrack was horrible. The whole",
          "I've been wondering where (somewhere nearby) I could take my daughter to watch the good ol' circus I used to enjoy as a kid...somewhat like the Moscow Circus...and I found it! Chimelong International Circus is simply awesome and is held on such a magnificent ground. Chimelong",
          "What a great show! Great acts and beautifully presented. Buy a combined safari and circus ticket and spend the day at the safari park and then catch the free shuttle bus to the circus in the evening. Both are easily reached on the Metro.",
          "I came here with family to the 7:30 show. Circuses not being a very popular thing in the U.S. I wasn't expecting much, but this show was awesome. Watching the trapeze was the best! There was not a moment wasted in the transition from one scene to the next. It was so fun to see",
          "It's only 5 min walking distance from the Chimelong hotel which is quite convenient, although there are quite a few stairs to be climbed. We decided to take our 3 year son there after hearing all the great things about the show. However, as soon as the show begins, our son was",
          "The place is start show at 730pm. Even on week days, the place is full of visitor. The show is great and amazing. Some stunt is dangerous and fantastic. A very well worth show to be in.",
          "where do i start, 1st visit to an circus and i was gobsmacked and amazed by the performances, never been to an circus before BUT this was no ordinary circus packed full of shows and excitement. it maybe slightly expensive but well worth the money. word of advise: MUST bring",
          "1. You can get tickets at the entrance. They start selling at 1230 p.m. $380 for Fri and Sat and other specific dates. $280 for Sun to Mon. See http://gz.chimelong.com/service/mxpj.shtml for more details like getting there and seating plan. 2. The park is open at 5 pm. So go",
          "I have seen Chinese acrobat shows, cirque de soleil in different part of the world, but was pleasantly surprise with the performance of this circus. First of all, the performance has a permanent home in Chimelong Panyu area. The Circus has everything complete. There was also the",
          "Visited in November 2014 for the 2nd time (1st time was 4 years ago). Brilliant teamwork of acrobats and gymnasts from Russia/Ukraine/ Belorusia and Columbia! They are Dare Devils!!!! 2 hours passed as 2 minutes! They maintain very high standards in traditions of Soviet Union",
          "The Chang Long International Circus really lives up to its reputation. This is the best circus I have ever seen. It is a great combination of beautiful music and lighting, romance, excitement and joy.",
          "I never thought I would enjoy a circus this much. Not only were the performers skillful and fantastic, the clown acts and the animals all added to the charm and entertainment. There was enough variance to the circus acts. Various animals, including bears, monkeys, horses,",
          "No need to repeat everything again - yes, really comparable to Cirque du Solei. Let me just tell You the easiest way to get there: get the metro to \"Hanxi Changlong\"-Station, where on the other side of the road (there\u00b4s a flyover) free shuttle-buses will take You to the circus.",
          "I just want to say that I really enjoyed this show. Cirque du soleil is nothing compared to this show. Loved it.",
          "the circus was very big and amazing, entertaining for the young and old. your eyes would be glued to the performance, you should sit at the first row of the 2nd compartment to see the parade infront of your eyes as the performers walk along that path. if not, you should sit at",
          "Its just world class Circus ! Giant tent, lost of artist, animals. Light and sounds also fantastic. Don\u00b4t miss it if you are in Guangzhou.",
          "Like every thing there , light's , music, fire works during the shwos .. it was unforgettable experience.",
          "I first visited this place 2 years ago and liked it. They have so many acrobatic performances with lighting and firework displays that you get lost in wonder. I again visited this place with my 3 year old son and after almost a year he still remembers the circus. He saw so many",
          "In this age of cirque du soleil, it's always good to see the traditional circus with all the animals. The Russian bear circus part was amazing. ( not for animal activists)",
          "Very very very good place. Charge ur cam well ..amazing time in amazing place..free wifi...normal ticket will be good",
          "We got invited here by a local friend's family, and I must say this was the most spectacular show we have ever seen. Their skills were amazing, and all of my kids were really charmed by show. But on the other hand, we also got told many disturbing behind-the-scenes about how the",
          "If you have kids, you must go. If you don't have kids, borrow some. If you can't find any, go anyway. WOW. Don't bother paying extra for the \"VIP Seating.\" Not worth it. Just go early enough to choose good seats nearby, with a good view of the stage. Not really a bad seat",
          "Like S&R you see white tigers and lions plus magic plus fantastic acrobats, but would you expect 7 elephants, bears, camels, monkeys, dogs, llamas, crocodiles, horses, flamingos, kudus, giraffes (!), guinea fowl, flying pigeons and pelicans all appearing in the show. The",
          "A non stop performance which astonished you with one after another surprises. The clowns, the autobatic performers, animals, dance girls all performed magnificiently well. Well Done. Encourage folks to come and watch the show.",
          "The circus is amazing, definitely worth a visit. The acts are stunning as are the lasers and animals in the show. It is not too expensive either and worth every penny. If we ever come back here we will certainly go again, highly recommended !",
          "Nobody does acrobatics better than the Chinese! I was amazed at how they flipped, tumbled, jumped and defied gravity and even death itself in their performances. They seemed to have no fear and the crowd was captivated by their every move. Truly a great show that everyone in",
          "Everyone who comes GZ must watch this! It is reasonably priced and extremely exciting. Watching this keeps you on the edge and all the jaw dropping acts make you gasp in horror and sigh in relief. Amazing night here!",
          "Defintiely worth to watch this amazing and stunning performance of circus at night after visitng the Safari Park during daytime. I think thier style is combined western and Chinese Different from what will see in western countries. Anyway, suggest to arrive earlier to find a",
          "The circus is all I expected and more!I went on a weekday so was fairly quieter. I got the regular seats ( yellow section) . The show is out of the world with every act under the sun : right from clowns, animals ( even giraffe, zebras, flamingos etc.!) , bears on motorcycles ,",
          "Never expected the performance is so stunning, so excited and yet very pleasant and enjoyable. The most striking impressive is the 5 circle wheels with 5 skillful stuntman appearance. The circus is suitable for all, don't miss it when you are at Guangzhou.",
          "the acrobats and tricks were just amazing,mind blowing and one of the best i have seen.would recommend if you have sometime to spare",
          "A different kind of circus. Go to the safari or the park and end your day watching the circus. This is highly recommended. A family fun activity. They even offer free shuttle service to pick you up and take you back to the metro station",

          "It's a real international circus with most of the performances are coming from Russia and China.. It's stunning and entertaining. There's a shuttle bus near the metro station to take you to the circus.. Come earlier and get the perfect seat for you!",
          "A \"must see\", the performances were mouth dropping. The only downside, to me personally, was the use of animals however they all appeared well cared for and were only on show for short times. To get reasonable seats I would suggest you go in at least an hour prior to departure.",
          "I was surprised with this shoe! The first 10 minutes for example are so spectacular in any other show in the world this would be the final! To satisfy an Asian crowed there is always action and does not get boring for a second! The only thing I did not like were the bears",

          "This was absolutely amazing, we came quite late but still got seats up the back and had an amazing view. The talent of these people are absolutely amazing I could watch the motorbikes all day. The only thing I didn't like were the animals, Bears, Lions, Tigers, These are not",

          "I was not expecting so much but was really impressed. Be careful it can be difficult to get seats just turning there. Same if you need a taxi ride to come back to Guangzhou, you will need patience and money! But still really worth going.",

          "This is a world class circus with an international cast. Spectacular performances. Maybe take a cushion if you want to be comfy.",
          "Great Circus but not so sure about the animal tricks made me a little unconfortable. Its a cross between old school circus with a touch of Cirque but i must say some impressive acts.",
          "Attended Circus during a business trip to Guangzhou. It was a very good fast moving show. Excellent mix of action, comedy and animals. Sit near the main walk way for best view of performers and animals. No need to pay extra for VIP seats if you arrive early.",
          "Amazing performers and show. Unfortunately, It was pity to see animals perform who were forced to be there. Animals lashed out on stage several times and looked mistreated. I'm an avid fan of amazing performances however I feel think animals should be subject to mistreatment.",

          "The Chang Long Circus is small, but has some great acts and is definitely worth the cost. Some of the animal acts are slightly questionable (I've never enjoyed seeing farm animals herded by another animal) but for the most part there's some very talented people working hard to",

          "The traditional circus never interested me back in time, and it would certainly not now. But Chimelong circus is not a \"traditional circus\", it's more like a \"Big SHOW\". The show never stops for 2 hours, alternating emotion, fun, fear, surprise... You cannot even go 2 minutes",
          "The show was just spectacular. Very skillfully performed and put together. One of the highlights of our time in guangzhou. Only 2 small negatives: the ushers should do their job properly, and reprimand the people in the front row who keep getting up and running around to take",
          "It is one of many attractions in the Chimelong park. You can take a free shuttle from Chimelong safari park to the circus show. The show is amazing and well prepared, the staff is friendly and attentive but little English. The show is worth the time and money, it is must see",
          "I don't even like circus. Ever since I was little, I thought the circus was just a distraction for the simple-minded. Well, circus has evolved since then. What we saw in Guangzhou was a production, not just a circus. This is a Hollywood-level show that features the next level of",

          "The circus itself cost me 180 yuan. There are outstanding acrobats, shows with animals, motorbike riders in a sphere, and lots of exciting things. I went there twice, and the shows were a little different. I was amazed how people walk with elephants, giraffes, flamingos in a row",
          "I paid 390 yuan (a package deal) for the admission fee for 2 attractions - Changlong International Circus plus the Chimelong Paradise theme park. They also have 2 other attractions which are the water theme park and the night safari but my fmly and I weren't keen of that.",
          "I loved the experience...It is a mixture of cirque du soleil and your classic childhood circus. Worth going if you are in Guangzhou.",

          "Great habitat, rivaling San Diago Zoo. Top niche tiger breeding program. In 20 minutes, you experience tiger mom & baby, cubs playing, big cat climbing, diving, swimming. Reptile collection and exhibit is great. Never seen as many active big snakes as here. Safari is good -",
          "It was really interesting to see alll the circus acts.I loved the atmosphere,all the effects especially the lightings(all the 3D light projected).............There were many animals in the show,white tiger,lion......and i was surprised to see two hornbills at the end!!!Although",
          "Left me all excited and happy, great experience, varied, unbelieveble. Got there unaware, but loved it to bits.",
          "Loved the animals and the acrobatic acts. Not too long (1.5 hour show with no intermission). Good for children, free seating for the regular tickets so get in early for good seats. Not very wheelchair friendly and there are only steps leading to the seating arenas.",
          "You have to see it to believe it! Who'd have thought you could include so many animals in one show and your bound to see something you've never seen before- only in China. Dont worry they say none of the animals were harmed during the show but I still dont believe they like",
          "Animals and people doing stunts. It is simply amazing. Non stop action with not a single minute of lull time. The best thing is the price is cheap compared to the other shows in other countries. Definitely a must!",
          "If you don't like trained circus animals, you won't like this. But even if you don't mind circus animals, it's still just average. Nothing too special compared to other world class circuses.",
          "A must go destination in Guangzhou! The one and half hour show is full of excitement with non-stop entertainment. Even our 5 years old daughter seems to enjoyed it. She love it so much and dance all the way. We have been to Cirque du soleil and house of dancing water so we can",
          "Have seen the show three times now. Still amazed with the performance! The food they sell there is awful... avoid it if you can as it's very expensive too.",

          "This is the second time that my wife and I saw this circus show and we enjoyed it just as much as the first time. The human acts are great - somehow they got 6 motorcyclists into the steel sphere (the most we've seen is 4). However, the animal acts are just out of this world!",
          "It's go, go, go from the start. Continuous entertainment for all ages. Heart stopping acts, pyrotechnics, all the animals are there from monkeys to elephants, bears and pigs and lots more. Had to ask myself whether the bears were real or in costume, so amazing is it what they",
          "Everything was very neat to see. The show was amazing! This park where it is located is well laid out! Easy to find and close to subway. Taxis are outside after show also for later in the night.",
          "I think a lot of people would complain about the animals right. Yes, but this is the diference of this show. A traditional circus script with a lot of technology and animals. Once you are in Guangzhou. I had a lot of fun. Try to visit the zoo in the same day, they are part of",
          "China itself has a huge number of good acrobats and performers of various sorts. Here at Chang Long, I was pleasantly surprised by the international mix of performers from across the world. The setting is quite \"western\" and is a good complement to other more ethnic",

          "This was a very entertaining show! Lots of animal acts that I hadn't seen before (honestly haven't been to too many circuses though - only Barnum and Bailey back in the US). Teenagers loved it too. Not super cheap, but a nice evening activity. Not air-conditioned (kind of a",

          "I hate to admit it, but I went to the Chimelong Circus due to the excellent TripAdvisor reviews. And as usual, it wasn't a disappointment! It was very entertaining and the performers (mainly foreigners) were highly trained and skilled. My only issue was the use of animals in the",

          "This show totally exceeded all my expectations. I' a bit ambivalent about animals in circuses so don't go if you don't want to see performing bears, monkeys, elephants & horses but the clowns and gymnasts were brilliant. I could never have imagined seeing flamingos, swans, even",
          "I have watched cirque du Soleil in a number of countries but its the first time I have seen a circus which can match them if not better. The performance was flawless, colorful, comical, thrilling, and there was never a dull moment. But Unlike cirque du Soleil the theme is rather",

          "This is a very entertaining circus - great for kids and adults. For seating, there is an area (if I didn't remember wrongly, it's Area D) reserved for the hotel guests and a VIP area which you have to pay extra for. These two areas are the closest to the stage. The thing is",

          "This show was lively, entertaining, and kept the audience engaged! Our group watched Zaia in Macao a few years ago and we were all disappointed, and we hesitated going to this show, but had heard good things about it, so we went. . . All of us LOVED it! Others in our group",
          "They have put up an impressive performance. Interesting. Exciting. Beautiful effects. Worth the ticket price to go.",
          "I was debating, based on cost, to add it or not to my trip. Ended up being on of the best things we did as a family in China. The performers, both people and animals, just kept on coming. In fact had to time to use the restroom as the show is literally non stoop. Note that",
          "By writing this review I will provide some useful information that I would like to have before I visited this show. The circus is a one of 4 different recreational sites located in one aria. In the ticket the sites are named as: Chimelong Paradise, Chimelong International",

          "I think this is one of the shows you should not miss if you are in guangzhou. It is world class circus and has one show everyday at 7:30pm. The price is a little steep at \u00a5280 per person but, it is completely worth a watch. You will be absolutely enthralled.",
          "Been a couple of times as I live near the Chimelong Park Complex. First place I think of to go when friends and family visit. When I first had the chance to go here I was reserved as many places lack attention to detail in China. Chimelong Circus really can rival others around",

          "The performance by the cast in the circus were brilliant. It is worth a visit if you can stomach the cruelty to animals at the same time. The performance was so good that I think that they do not even need any animals to spice up the show. The show by the humans was the best",
          "I didn't expect much about the circus since I was thingking we are in China and so it might be dirty or boring. But having read some reviews at tripadvisor that it was good I decided to bring the family and watch. Wow the family was super amazed at how clean and classy the",

          "We took our 5 and 7 year olds and they both loved it. Most people do. There are dramatic costumes, makeup, and music. Everything is loud and big and extravagant and it's a good show if you're not looking for anything too high brow. But stepping back, it is a style of circus",
          "Overall quite an awesome visual spectacle of human talent and animal abilities! Probably made the long drive from Guangzhou itself worth it... Key highlights: - Circle or ring of death: acrobats standing on huge rotating wheels - Divers: particularly the final, top-most dive;",
          "I am all for a good time, and love human Circuses (Cirque d Soleil, Pickle Samily, etc.). However, I feel it is unethical to financially support people that cause unnecessary harm and suffering to animals. When you buy a ticket, you are directly paying someone to treat animals",
          "Children and adults trully enjoyed the show. The human performers are great but it is a bit sad to see wild animals being trained to perform. Nevertheless, what is a circus without animals that children love so much!",
          "Since there arent any resident comtemporary circus in Hong Kong, people can get here for an international circus apart from picking cirque du soleil as it provides a joyful and carnival like circus for children. Unlike the cirque du soleil in Macao, the circus is less",

          "After reading the reviews here, I was expecting a lot and I was not disappointed. We enjoyed it and was amazed at the animals involved in the circus show. The parade of the performers was unexpected but appreciated. Young or old, this is a circus for everyone. Wonderful!",
          "Pricey but we enjoyed the show. There were acrobats and animals in the show. The animals were not abused in any way. The show was 2 hours. One thing i didn't like was the lack of story line. If there is one, it will make this a very enjoyable show.",
          "This is truly an international circus with artistes from Russia, Bellaurs, Kenya, Brazil and many other countries. The great entertainment for every age group. The 3D effect was amazning. The Music, the lighting and the well syncronised acts were really amazing. Its a must see",

          "Please don't miss it. Try and take VIP seats. Be there at least one hour prior. Centre seats good. If u r closer to the stage u tend to get gifts from the circus clowns.",
          "A very entertaining and full show featuring great skills, animals and good comedy from the clowns. Definitely worth the effort to get there and see a world-class show",
          "This is a very nice circus, it can be compared to many international circus. So many performers and the show was very smooth. I like the big turning circle where the performer walk on the wheel's top which it was turning. It was like 20 meter off ground. It was spectacular.",
          "Overall, the show was good, but not every part was impressive. Some of the performance seemed to be used to allow the stage to be set for the next part of the show but they were too long and and not so interesting.",
          "This is a truly international circus. If you are offended by trained animals then you shouldn't go to this. If however you feel that animals are intelligent and perhaps have a better life in a circus being well cared for than some other circumstances, then this is for you. As",

          "Frankly, Chimelong is only decent theme park in Guangzhou. If you have time to spare, go to the safari first in the afternoon and then catch the circus show in the evening. You may grab some dinner in one of the restaurants there. The seats for the circus is first come first",

          "The show is almost full-packed when we arrived and in less than 5 minutes, it started. People already know where to best sit, meaning they are not only first time audience but repeat audiences. The animals were wonderful, cute and talented. I forgot all about animal-cruelty",
          "I visited the circus first time this year even I have alrready been living in Guangzhou since 2009. Definitely waited too long for this, as its real good show with international group of artists. Absolutely recommendable if you have kids, but also something for adults too see",

          "Had an entertaining night at the Chimelong International circus on the 11 Dec. The standard of the performances were high. Maybe because it was a Sunday night, the stadium was only half filled. As we were in China, I expect the performers to be mainly Chinese and was surprised",

          "Loved the zoo, particularly that you had a good view of the pandas although there weren't many. Beautiful park but very difficult for a disabled person such as me. There were lots of stairs and lots of walking involved, but it was worth it. Plus the entrance fee was minimal.",
          "I was amazed with the number of rare animals in the Zoo. White Bengal tiger, Black leopard, and so on. But the jewel of the Zoo is the giant panda for me. The zoo is next to the metro station ZOO. Its easy to find. Ticket is 30 RMB for adult. You can see lot of animals in",
          "The closest metro station is Zoo from one side and a couple of stations from another side, entrance fee is 20 rmb for adults and 10 rmb for kids. Nice place, well maintained, cleaned, animals are pretty close to observe, during the week days not crowded. You can definitely spend",
          "It is a nice Zoo. In my opinion it is a place to visiting. We spend around 4h. To go there we take the taxi. It was easy to find. In the zoo, the animals have a large outlet area. You can see the animals very well (no bars). The zoo is very diverse and varied. Food left a lot",

          "We visited the zoo a month back to be nicely suprized from seeing another zoo that was not so good. The Guangzhou zoo is more respectful to most animals. The largest animals have a nice run too but need more grass. The zoo is well catering for prams & wheel chairs, also toilets",

          "In my honest opinion, the zoo is under maintained. and the story u heard about China sanitary is very true, i saw it with my own eyes to see the horrible restroom in the zoo area.. i threaten my kids pleaseeee hold your pee until mommy can take u somewhere decent to pee. The",
          "...it is not one of the great zoological parks... for example you can't compare it to San Diego...but better than most average zoo's. We had a great day out.",
          "One doesn't know what to expect when visiting zoos around the world regarding the animals and their living conditions but I was pleasantly surprised with the Guangzhou Zoo. Not a massive zoo but big enough. Good variety of animals and their habitats seemed to be quite decent,",
          "Unless you want to see normal people with their families spending their time off, this is not the place where you want to go in the current state of affairs. The site is under revsion, lots of cages were empty and some lonely animals were looking miserable and bored. Go to the",
          "I went to the Aquarium inside the zoo. My daughter loved watching the fish swimming and enjoyed the show by the seals and dolphins. However, one employee of the aquarium has completely ruined our great experience at the aquarium. After the dolphins show was over, my family used",
          "I took my 1year old daughter to the zoo. Great location, easy access by the subway (BTW, my daughter loved the subway station. the walls full of animals paints.) Unfortunately, Panda section was under constraction but my family could spend great time.",
          "Went there in April 2017. Was very exciting. Shows happening all the time. Loads of different animal attractions. Beautiful gardens. Well set out. Animals looked in very good condition and had large open enclosures. Animals were happy and seemed to enjoy interacting with the",
          "Came to see the giant pandas, however the exhibit was closed for renovations. :( At least the red pandas were there to see. :) All in all not much of a zoo.",
          "Guangzhou zoo is surrounded by high rise units and not far from Teem mall. Panda enclosure was closed when we visited and enclosures show sign of ageing. Admission for 2 adults was 40 RMB and user pay for the rides.",
          "The good thing about this zoo is that it's in the center of Guangzhou, just next to a metro station...easy to access. But because it's in the city center, the zoo is very small. Been once and will not go back again, if I wanna spend a super good whole day at the zoo, I'd rather",
          "A well kept and clean zoo, however it seems like its always under construction. Its centrally located so you can take the Metro subway and the front gate is right there. A quick tip, bring vegetable like celery or something long and green to the zoo as they have a feed the",
          "If you want to go to Guangzhou zoo, the best I can tell you is that it is easy to get there. The state of some of the enclosures is terrible, with a lot of dirty water and limited space. We paid extra to go to some of the zoo 'experiences', none of which were worth the time. I",
          "Since this zoo is under renovation and lots of animals have been shifted , I guess you can skip it unless it is completely renovated. pandas and other interesting animals were not there. so go for chimelong safari , which is obviously lot more costlier than this zoo.. The plus",
          "No pandas ( that section is closed till tba) the rest of the zoo is very old n need remodeling animals look all sad n bothered \ud83d\ude15 I wouldn't recommend if you are from US , we got way better zoo . They also have seaworld section that cost extra to get into , but like I said just",
          "Whilst some enclosures are great, with space, shelter, water areas for the animals housed in them, others are not. It is obvious that they are modernising and improving but frustrating to see some areas are still in the style of bad zoos. Family friendly, lots of eating areas.",
          "Sadly, a lot of animal houses were under construction, including the panda, kangaroo and zebra. Furthermore, it seemed a bit strange to see the racoons having a huge space and, for example, the elephant only a small space. However, for only \u00a520 it was nice to spend a morning",
          "Mostly everything was under construction, it was completely terrible! I went for pandas only but no pandas were seen. There were very few animals. The circus inside was cool and for that it cost 20 yuan for each person even if you paid for the entrance , you need to pay",
          "I did think it a little odd that raccoons got a huge exhibit and the big cats were squeezed into cages so small I wanted to cry. Overall, the zoo is large and beautiful. There were two giant pandas there when we went.",
          "We went here to pass a day. This zoo is poor to average. The pens for animals are small and lots of stairs. IT IS NOT STROLLER FRIENDLY. I ended up carrying the stroller 75% of the time because of the number of stairs. We saw baby ducks and mice in the snake pens which was",
          "Everything was under construction, no big pandas seen, and really few animals overall. Taxi drivers didn't even know the place and they don't speak/understand English at all! Saw two red pandas, beautiful creature but not enough to describe as an useful / nice experience!",
          "The condition of the zoo is only of acceptable standard but China zoo are always very impressive in the range of animals they have. Ticket price is low at CNY 20 and place is directly accessible by MRT.",
          "I spent the afternoon here in September and the weather was still brutally hot so we didn't spend to long walking round as it was too hot. The Zoo is ok, the enclosures are very small though and the elephant enclosure is ridiculous. they do have a good selection of animals and",
          "We enjoyed visiting the Guangzhou Zoo when we were in China. The price was reasonable to get in, and there were some unique animals like the white lions which we enjoyed seeing. The giant pandas were inside of a building staying cool, which disappointed us, but nobody could",
          "There isn't anything really special about this place. I have seen better Zoos, but it still can be a good way to spend the day out if you have nothing else to do. Some interesting animals to see, like the Pandas, which I didn't get to since their section was being renovated. I",
          "A lot of variaty of animals but some of them were in a not so big cages, like tiger, lynx, lion, leopard.",
          "Before the visit, one told me the zoo is not worth to visit. But i just go, sad to say, almost half of exhibits are upgrading including giant panda! The closures are old and not maintain. Elephant look alone and not in good shape!",
          "For my sister's birthday, we took a trip to China. We wanted to go to a zoo and we found ourselves buying tickets to go to Guangzhou's zoo. The only thing I can say was it was amazing. There were many animals and the pandas were super cute. My only concern is their restroom. It",
          "Great place to take smaller kids. Bear exhibit is under construction. Had a fun time and saw lots of animals.",
          "It's nice place for kids have lot of birds few animals and kids play area where they can find swings and rides . Good place to visit with kids only",
          "This is a great Zoo! Our family loved it and we loved how close you were to some animals. Being able to enjoy different kinds of animals was also really neat! We highly recommend.",
          "Very nice zoo .All visitors should vist this zoo.Different typs of animals are there . I recommend this zoo for all visitors.",
          "This zoo was located very well, near the metro and central as well. The environment inside the zoo is very nice and there are plenty of different types of animals, elephants, fishes, Tigers, reptiles and much more. Unfortunately they were rebuilding many things and therefore we",
          "We went there to see pandas, but it was probably too hot so they've been locked away, and you could sort of see the shapes via window, but that's it. Plus they were renovating virtually everything else... So more people than animals! With one cool exception, giraffes! Those were",
          "It's a good pass time but this activity is for children & familys, you can see nothing special or different to other zoos in the world. It's not very clean and everythings is old and used!",
          "the treatment of pandas was great but in the childrens show a alsation dog which was scared of the dog handler was performing tricks in the show a sun bear in very poor health was forced to do tricks. in the goldfish garden a paddling pool was full of baby goldfish children were",
          "Quite small. Very cheap though and the kids enjoyed it. We couldn't see the pandas as they were locked up. Very small enclosure for the tiger.",
          "Not the same range of animals as other zoo's I have visited. However if you have smaller kids it would be worth visiting. Prices are ok but when you buy a ticket you get the option to buy entry to 3 optional parts. The optional parts are not that big.",
          "Most visitors come for the Panda Expo...but this nice zoo offers thousands of other animals and birds from throughout Asia and Oceania. Meander thru the rolling grounds for the day and see many impressive expositions and shows. Great place for the kiddies.",
          "Visited in 2011, Both of the attractions are well worth the money, be sure to leave all day. The bird exhibit was fun be sure to bring paper Chinese Money for the birds to get. The food was good in the park, especially the spaghetti with a Chinese flair.",
          "If you like zoo, enjoy your time here! Zoo has many different animals, big territory and a lot of Chinese! But for price of 20 RMB you should really enjoy. Good place just for spend your free time when you don't know what to do! It's really government zoo and don't expect luxury",
          "Quite disappointed because are not able to see the panda clearly because the two giant pandas were caged in the blur glass house.But seeing the red panda walking around and two kangaroos ,it's worth to visit the zoo.",
          "Absolute rubbish; saw raccoons and giraffe - that was it! No lions, tigers, pandas nothing - no 'big ticket' animals at all - the worst zoo I have ever been to. Makes Delhi Zoo a positive joy!!!!",
          "Got bored and decided to visit the zoo. I took the train from guangzhou east railway. Being a westerner who speaks no chinese it was difficult trying to buy my ticket.Once inside you realize the zoo actually is not that big. I was impressed it had a small amusement park for the",
          "The biggest animals are very skinny and the worst is that the staff feeds them a couple of oz of food to keep them hungry and awake, and some stupid people can have fun with the desperate animals. I saw a tiger how it was forced to swim for a small piece of meat. And the safari,",
          "We went to Guangzhou Zoo last 2013. The facilities are a bit old but we still enjoyed our visit. We saw different kinds of animals. Tigers, Lions, Cheetahs, Leopards, Hyena, Rhino, Hippopotamus, Bear, Elephant, Giraffe, Birds, Lemur, Pigs, Monkeys, and a lot more. We are amazed",
          "Recommend for families visiting from HK. For a Chinese Zoo, the animals are in reasonable condition. We saw the panda triplets which was a plus - food very average, take your own.",
          "No really. It is worth the price. I have been to both and the other is much better. This zoo is no where near the level so he safari. Yea this one is cheep but you totally get what you pay for. We went to the safari and fed tigers, elephants and giraffes and even petted and",
          "It's an amazing place to visit while being in China, you can see very large variety of animals as well as glass under water and Dolphins show, it's very suitable to go there with friends, family and kids, they have also shops where you can take pictures and buy souvenirs, many",
          "This Zoo is in the heart of the city and very easy to get to. It is a little jaded in its presentation, but I have never seen such large tigers anywhere else and the hippos and rhinocerii were equally impressive. One of the bull elephants was also extremely large.",
          "With the ticket prices cheap. The zoo here is very crowded visitors. In the zoo have many kind of animals and the most famous animal is panda. Many animals here is very skinny and less well maintained.",
          "Today me and my gf visited the zoo, Price per person: 20RMB fee for normal visit, 50RMB all included like small animal show and goldfish garden If you buy the basic one you are able to buy upgrades inside of the park. I was surprised by the amount of different animals which",
          "fair not fantastic except dolphin show and panda.many animals are just a pictures on the signs but also have very uniqe animals ..the elephant is very very huge",
          "I love animals and when I visited Guangzhou I decided to go to the zoo. It was ok but there's a lot of room for improvement. Hope that it will be like Singapore zoo one day!",
          "We couldn't leave Guangzhou without seeing it's zoo . When we interred the zoo , we didn't know where to start , so took the guide book . After one our of watching the animals, we went eat in restaurant. Then we went to buy some souvenirs from the gift shop .",
          "Easily accessible from subway line 5 - the zoo is very affordable. Basic cost for the zoo is 20 rmb although you can add additional options for this. The zoo is quite large and you should plan on at least 2 hours to look at everything. Some of the exhibits are rather sparce",
          "It's an old zoo but it had lots of different animals. Additional admission to see some areas but most, including the pandas, were part of basic admission. Easy to get on mass transit and less overwhelming than a safari park.",
          "The zoo is a great thing to do if you have young kids. It was really good to see the pandas although everyone was taking photos of our blue eyed blonde headed children instead. It's not the worlds best zoo but conditions were OK and it has nice grounds.",
          "Found the zoo a good attraction. It is near the metro station. They have a variety of birds and animal in cages. Certain attractions for children are ok. The panda bear was sleeping during my visit and I had a long wait to see it. The ocean attraction is good an I spend a good",
          "For a zoo in the middle of the city, and for the price you pay - 20rmb for the standard ticket - 50rmb for all the attractions - it really is what you pay for. A lot of people, very crowded in certain places. Quite a few of the habitats are small. They need more people on the",
          "The Guangzhou zoo is situated in an ideal location in the city area. It is easily accessible by train, bus or taxi. You pay RMB 25 for entrance. However, you will have to pay RMB 100 to 125 to have access to the ocean park and the ocean park performances. A few observations: 1.",
          "Very easy to acces, big enough place, some animals look so sad with small place to live but the others have a big 'house' I went there only for Panda (summer time) but unfortunately they were in glass house that we can't see clearly, i think they should make acces for us to be",
          "We went to the zoo in hope to see pandas, but sadly they were in glass house (because the weather was too hot for them to be outside) and couldn't have a good look. The zoo itselt is nothing special, rather disappointing as some cages were really small and I felt really bad",
          "It's interesting to see how \"zoo\" is done in another country. Many of the enclosures are small concrete and barred. But some are the newer style creative layout. All the animals looked in top notch condition and we saw some that you can't usually get close to. A Siberian",
          "Some of the exhibits for the animals were clean, well planted and modern other exhibits(bears) were very old and dated. Concrete. Very sad to see in this day and age. Pandas were in side a building that had dirty plastic windows. Very hard to see them. their was an aquarium but",
          "We visited the zoo and Water World. Buying a combined ticket at the booths to the right of the main entrance saved us about an hour wait over the main zoo ticket line. Most of the animal enclosures were fairly good sized and all of them seemed clean. The big cats have small",
          "This was part of day trip from Hong Kong into China. We travelled in by coach and out by train visiting a number of places on route. The end of the trip took us to the zoo which was the highlight but sadly we were not given enough time to really explore the zoo. All the same",
          "I liked Guangzhou zoo very much, so many animals, and beautiful nature. The territory of the Guangzhou zoo is big enough.....we get tired a little)))",
          "If you love animals, you will love this place. The ticket is very cheap. Have a few hours in hand for a complete visit or just take the buggy service available for covering the entire zoo. The pandas are kept inside during summers. :-(",
          "A bit disappointing in this old style zoo. It's convenient to the metro stop and watching the Chinese family interact made it worthwhile. Typical small zoo wedged into a residential area of the city. If you're sensitive to seeing some types of animals in traditional cages,",
          "Best zoo I've ever been to. Animals looked happy and playing. Very visitor friendly! Highly recommended!! Ot was a very hot sunny day but the park was mainly covered in shade by all the trees so no problem! Good for young and old!",
          "The newly build chimpanzees', little pandas', wolves' and racoons' outdoor enclosures are finished and partially operational. It is a great fun seeing the animals playing and fooling around in groups, enjoying the natural habitat they were given and the comfort of it such as e.",
          "First of all DO NOT GO on a Weekend or Chinese holidays , it is a zoo on steroids. Tons of people (but the again is china). Mondays seem to be the ideal day, super nice to enjoy and see everything. Second if you are going in the summer make sure to take really comfortable",
          "Coming from Australia our zoos are different to Guangzhou zoo. The zoo was very busy on the Sunday we visited as the Chinese frequent parks and gardens on the weekends. I found some good points and not so good. The zoo was clean and had good facilities. The high light was the",
          "I have been to this zoo a couple of times over the years. Of ones I have visited in China, it is the nicest. It was cleaner this time than last, the kids enjoyed seeing the pandas. It is hot and humid in May and the summer, take water!",
          "Along the very main road of Zhongshan Rd, you can take bus #85 all the way to the zoo. It's faster than taking underground metro where you have to switch lines a number of times. The zoo also houses the aquarium but that would require another day's visit in itself. I enjoyed",
          "If you are in Guanzhou and not visiting the zoo than you missed the best thing in your life. This is combined with zoo and park. You will find aquatic fun like dollphin show, aquarium, colorful fishes, flemingoes and various ducks swimming in the lake.",
          "Very good spot in the city,specialy to pay a visit with yr family.Easy to come by metro in very short time.\u0130t is not well maintained like the ones in western countries,but still worth of visiting it.You must see Pandas.",
          "About Zoo,very nice,all people are going there to see Pandas so its getting quite crowded,so better visit during weekdays daytime.",
          "Well we got to see what we wanted - the Pandas. There are a lot of interesting animals. But it is so sad :'( We come from New Zealand and it is absolutely no comparison to the zoos here. TINY cages. Beautiful rare white tiger in a few square metres cage just laying on concrete.",
          "Great Zoo! No comparison with the London Zoo, which is rubbish. We saw happy animals, in nice surroundings. The ticket is very cheap and one of the best ZOOs we have seen.",
          "Definitely not Toronto Zoo.. Animals looked small and sad.. but hey, its China. What do you expect? I really just went for the pandas as i had never seen them before. Was kinda sad there was only two.. Average zoo and was also only $5 canadian a person for entry... Really cheap",
          "What can I say about this place not much good , The animals are not treated the way the should be , as tourist I was virtually left to try and find the animals with a map that was written in Chinese . The female person showing me around was as about helpful as a blind man",
          "My family enjoyed an afternoon exploring the zoo. We took the subway two stops from our hotel and there it was. The zoo was much larger inside then it appeared. The habitats for most animals were some of the nicest I've seen anywhere. Very clean and beautiful flora",
          "from a mediocre Zoo park visited in 1998 it is improving as i speak to you, and is a full grown park now in 2015. cleaner, nicer, and much much improvements for the animals. some extra's are extremley overpriced, the zoo itself is very cheap by park standards of today and",
          "We went to the zoo during the spring festival. This was actually a good decision because the zoo was relatively empty. Personally I looked forward to seeing the pandas because I hadn't seen any in my life. The pandas didn't let me down. They were as cute and lazy as ever. The",
          "The city Zoo is old but inside is clean and provided the area to be adequate of type of animals. The area is separated into Zoo, Ocean World, Children Zoo, Gold Fish Area, Lake, 3D show and Ride. Certain of the area is charge individually or you can buy the ticket at the",
          "Yes GZ Zoo has been famous for decades, and also its proximity and low fare are an attraction. But year-long wear and tear without right maintenance , animals getting old and not replaced...just make it idle all day, but filled up full in weekends and public holidays.",
          "Having in mind this is not Orlando, USA... this place worth a visit. I don't like Zoos, the idea of animals in cages is not my favorite, but in this place you can tell they have plenty of room, aquariums are beautiful and not too many people around (our visit was wednesday...",
          "it's always packed and swimming with children, like all zoos, but it's the condition of the animals that makes my heart hurt. The tigers are too skinny, obviously underfed, and the big bears and tigers and lions are confined into tiny little cells. They don't move because they",
          "It is certain that Guangzhou Zoo is not a good choice for those who want to find some rare animal or some energetic animal. I have been there for many times since I was a little girl. For me, it is a place full of memory. Memory about my life and old Guangzhou.",
          "We went here with high expectations but left disappointed. Animals look neglected and the maintenance was very poor. Place looks slightly run down. Have been to much better zoos than this.",
          "It is a good place for family. Lots and lots of different animals, children love to see these animals in a close distance. You can even feed them too",
          "This zoo doesn't understand the meaning of the words \"conservation\" or \"education\". For Guangzhou Zoo it's all about shoving animals in small cages for tourists to gawk at (and, more often than not, throw food / bottles / rubbish into the enclosures). Every animal looked",
          "This is really not the best place to see animals in GZ. Go to Chimelong Safari Park. They do not care for animals in the way many Westerners think they should. It's pitiful and very crowded.",
          "The zoo is a large area with wide paths. The animals were moving lively. In the other end of the area there is a safari where yuo sit in a train and it goes from one theme to another.",
          "This is the worst experience I had in Guangzhou. There not much animals to see. Besides you have pay a lot for additional features and wait in long queues to get in to them. Only best thing is the food inside the zoo besides wont recommmend to go in. Better to go Six Banyan",
          "A different, more comfortabe feeling at this zoo than most. Exhibits have a more open feeling, and are large. The zoo wasn't crowded that day, but that may not be normal. Not expensive. We enjoyed all the big cats. Not a big nor expansive zoo, but a nice break, located right in",
          "I visited the zoo yesterday and was somewhat shocked by the condition of many of the exhibits. Most of the animals are housed in small compounds, and many of the exhibits had no animals in them.",
          "Been a few times to the guangzhou zoo, and always this was a nice trip out with the children and visitors. The zoo is large, there are two gates to enter, and the entrance fee is very reasonable. The zoo is always improving, has a nice childrens zoo, a play ground, and most of",
          "Poor conditions for the animals, not much to see for the visitors as the cage / enclosure designs are like prison cells. Lack of direction signage within the zoo, walking to the destination in mind was difficult. Positive side, very affordable entrance fee (20RMB for general",
          "The place is okay. I went there during the Chinese New Year. The Chinese kept staring the animals but my foreign face. That was annoying. So many people. The cats were in really small cages, poor animals! We had to walk in a line to see some species. I loved zebras, an",
          "The zoo is in the center of Guangzhou and can be easily reached by metro or buses. The entrance fee is considerate. Best days to go are Monday to Friday due to the fact that most people work then, therefore the zoo belongs to you, almost. A nice extra is, for a little fee you",
          "This trip was expensive $250 Australian per person and very very long 16 hours. A boring trip showing very few attractions. The attractions shown had shops attached to the and the purpose of the shop was to coerce you into buying their goods. The included lunch was very poor,",
          "Many of the animals are kept in small, bare cages that clearly aren't fit for habitation. It was as though the zoo didn't have room for the animals they had and just put them wherever. There was a real tiger habitat with 3 animals in it and 5 or 6 others kept in small cages",
          "The few to get in is cheap (20 rmb) and feeding the giraffes was definitely the high point. I think workers should be aware to those who are throwing food and touching the animals and start teaching more respect. Its disappointing to see the jaguars, wolves and panthers in",
          "It was great to hand feed the giraffes at the Guangzhou zoo. Most of the caged animals are in old style wire cages with concrete floors. Hoping they can do some upgrades on the cages in the near future. It would make the animals and the visitors happy. There are kids rides",
          "Not a bad place to go with kids and the compound is actually very big, though the variety of animals on display could have been more. Nonetheless, I would still say this was a good trip to see the pandas in their native country although not in Szechuan itself.",
          "I love animals, am an avid photographer of animals and I had heard the Guangzhou Zoo was probably one of the best in China, as far as a best zoo in China can go. Although it's a few years since visiting, Shanghai Zoo was pretty grim for the most part, and Beijing (apart from",
          "I visited the Zoo last week and walked away fairly depressed. While there were a few decent sized enclosures (Elephant and Tiger) I was nothing short of disgusted at the terrible enclosures many of the large cats were enclosed. They were held in tiny concrete enclosures with no",
          "We visited during China National Holiday and the crowds were enormous. I thought the zoo had a good variety of animals and all seemed to be easy to view. It was not overly smelly as some zoos can be and I thought most of the displays were generally well done. My granddaughter",
          "I visited the zoo last week and was pleasantly surprised how well looked after the animals were and in good surroundings. There was lots of animals too of the same species, we were able to purchase at 15 RMb bananas for the elephants, leaves for the giraffes. There are lots of",
          "i was shocked how small the cages and open spaces are for most of the animals also the way through the zoo is very confusing throughout there is not really a system in the way as for the stroller it is ok could be better, as everywhere you should def avoid weekends it over",
          "That was a cool experience. A safari where you can see more animals then you would on a real one in Africa, plenty of pandas, a lot of animals shows that fell like you are at the animal kingdom and the kindergarden where you could take a picture with baby animals (to bad it was",
          "really enjoyed the animals... giraffe exhibit is my favorite, got to feed them for the 1st time in my life... red pandas (if you are lucky enough to catch a glimpse) are very cute... monkeys and bears are nice, too... lots of animals are there, however, there is only one giant",
          "Maybe my experience was slightly ruined by the fact that the day was so hot and therefore really quite unpleasant to be walking around in but I was not a huge fan of this zoo. Yes, the entry was very cheap (20RMB), but zoos are usually more expensive in order that they can",
          "Lots of people having lots of fun, but I found the experience a little sad. Maybe we're spoilt for zoos in Sydney. The kangaroos looked pretty miserable in their dusty enclosure. If you like a good variety of antelopes - this is your place. Rushed through, saw the panda, who",
          "I loved it, my relatives did to there was so mouch to see, like the Goldfish garden and animal behavior exhibit. The exhibits were done nicely and if you asked the care takers would give you food to feed the animals! My favorite part was the Goldfish Garden because there was",

          "After writing a very negative review about a Bangkok zoo recently I am pleased to be able to report on a totally opposite experience in my visit to Guangzhou Zoo. Set in an inner city location it has a metro station at the gate, there are ramps everywhere for those that need",
          "Located at zoo station, walking distance is one minute. You can buy ticket at 20RMB for admission. 30 RMB is admission + one attraction 40 RMB is admission + two attractions You can take a mini tram to walk around the zoo for 10 RMB. There are also kids performance :) Animals",
          "This was such a depressing place to visit. I can't imagine seeing much worse conditions in a major zoo. The small cages look like they belong from 100 years ago, especially the big cat enclosures. They are tiny concrete rings with no room for the cats to really move and it",
          "This zoo is a value at the price but the conditions for the animals leaves much to be desired. The shows at this zoo are well done but you can see the way they train the animals isn't the best. There are some amusement rides for people to go on at this zoo but they cost extra.",
          "is the biggest zoo i've ever seen... there's lots of kind of animals including PANDA. there are two pandas. you can see really close the animals. it is good if you have kids... BUT you have to bring your own food and water.",
          "we went to see the pandads and they where both just sitting aroun d and waiting for food once they where feed they just went inside and didnt come out again it was a very warm day so please go when it is a bit cooler and its hard in china but they will come out more if it isnt",
          "great long day out - tons of animals to visit - large free range enclosures for the well treated animals - comes complete with a massive circus next door with animals like dancing bears and trained orangutans entertaining the crowds.",
          "It would be hard to design environments which would stress or deprive animals more. This is a zoo from the early 1900s, where concrete is the preferred setting and animal have nothing to divert or stimulate them. It's just hideous. However, this seems not to be an issue,",
          "This is an ok zoo with a wide vareity of animals but if you are in GZ why not go to the Safari at Panyu wich is much better and more interesting. And the birds are not behind cages which is so thick you can not see the birds just pixales from them... On the plus side this is in",
          "Attended with my wife and 5-year-old. I have been to a lot of zoos, and this one is above average. It is clean and well priced, although like all zoos in China you will find extra fees inside the zoo to see certain animals or enter specific areas. The goldfish area is a bit",
          "Children will enjoy this zoo , it has a special part for baby animal . It's clean area and you can shop your favorit animal doll. You can find the water park next to it.",
          "Visited Guangzhou Zoo in December 2011 with my partner / fianc\u00e9. We both had a fantastic time and took plenty of pictures. Whether your visiting the zoo with or without children you'll be sure to have a tremendous time.",
          "I am no animal rights activist, but this was hard to witness. I am a fairly even keeled and positive reviewer, so to sum it up - we made the best of the park, but we did not stay very long. I tried to make the best of the situation with the kids so that we could make the most",
          "With the admission fee RMB 20 only and easily accessed by metro, me and my husband spent about 2hrs for a quick visit to the zoo. Since this zoo has been built for quite some time, you can see the facilities and stuff are quite old. But not a bad option if you are tired of the",
          "I had an okay time but i have no desire to come back again. The entry fee is cheap but it does not include any of the shows. So if you want to see the shows buy the ticket that includes it. The zoo closes early at 4pm, so make sure you know the times for the shows because you",
          "Compare to Changlong, it's very bad. The animals are very old and the management is not good.",
          "Well, it's free... or was it just really cheap? Either way, you get what you pay for. Some animals in small cages... if you're bored and don't want to spend a lot, a good way to spend an afternoon. But if you REALLY want to see animals and a good variety of them, go to Chimelong",
          "Its all there, sea world, birds, fish, panda, lions..a lot of animals...my children love it so much... Tip: Try to use the transport for tourist..need to pay but still cheap..u can walk and if you are tired..look for one and just hope in back for free as long you dont lost the",
          "Firstly, the cost: we are an english-speaking family of 5 and travelled from Tianhe district via taxi for 12RMB one-way. The admission was 50RMB for an adult, and there is an odd height-based system (encountered also at the hotel where we stayed) where kids under 1.2m are free",
          "Loved the Pandas and the Koalas I saw there. The zoo is huge with lots of animals who appear well kept in their natural environment. Don't miss the safari - you can join the free train ride into the safari park (comes with the ticket) or a private tour. I took the MTR to the",
          "The GZ zoo is fairly nice ... you can see panda bears and the other usual animals - some in plain cages. A few of the exhibits were empty. The hightlight of the visit was feeding the giraffe's - for a small extra fee they give you close up access and a bundle of leafy",
          "I just came back from Guangzhou , China 2 weeks ago. I had lots of fun. It is very close to Hong Kong, China, by train is around 2 hours. However, everything in Guangzhou is cheaper than Hong Kong, even though these both city have all most the same stuff. So i highly recommend"

          "Specialised museum Entrance is a nominal 10 yuan (about \u00a31). Modern design encloses the tomb (which you can enter), and separate building displays the artefacts and treasures found in the tomb \u2013 beautifully displayed. In the main building is a permanent world-famous exhibition",
          "Its waste of time..there is nothing special in that place... It's better visit other place in city..",
          "This museum was really wonderful! Most, if not all, descriptions were in English as well as Chinese. The museum was informative and the displays arranged thoughtfully.",
          "This was an interesting cultural artifact. The museum itself is well laid out, and the staff was generally helpful. The video presentation in one corner was informative.",
          "This is an actual burial site of king Nanyue, lots of ancient stuffs gathered when they discovered the tomb. You can also walk through the burial site itself, such an interesting place!",
          "An interesting museum wherein one can learn about their culture and historical facts. Do check it out when in Guangzhou.",
          "Very, very special: the story, the exhibits, the information you get. Learn how people lived here thousands years ago and appreciate the great culture that existed here. Spend few good hours in this important museum.",
          "This museum was more interesting than I anticipated with many artifacts and particularly interesting, archeological sites on display to visitors(you can actually see where the scientists found the remains of the king etc). Lovely for an afternoon.Free entry as far as I can",
          "A fascinating tour. I would definitely have this on your list if travelling to guangzhou. Only recently discovered, many artefacts have been especially well preserved.",
          "We combined this museum with Yuexui Park as it was across the freeway. I took my 3 and 6 year old there. The 6 year old was especially interested. There are several different exhibits before you actually her to the Nanyue King exhibit, which is located at the rear of the",
          "This museum is very well design. The museum exhibit the tomb they discover from a great emperor . If you know the history of this emperor you will appreciate and impress every thing you see. It is about the finest swords in history.about one of most beautiful woman in",
          "One of China's major archealogical discoveries, the tomb of Nanyue King Zhao Mo was only discovered in 1983. Another must see. Well preserved and presented. Explanations only in Chinese but the pamphlet is also in English.",
          "I finally got to see a jade burial suit of which I saw from a postcard when I was 10 years old. This is the highlight for me and this suit is the first of its kind and it was sewn with re silk thread. The museum is very well laid out and very thoughtfully display with",
          "I worked in Guangzhou for four weeks in October and November 2016. The Nanyue King Museum is worth a visit and very interesting. You can cover Guangxiao Temple, Temple of the Six Banyan Trees, Dr. Sun Yatsen Memorial Hall and the Nanyue King Museum by walking during a 3-4 hour",
          "This is a must if you want to understand about the Chinese history from the first source and not from books. The Museum is well organised you can see the tombs as well as lots of historical artifacts : everyday life, music, fashion etc. I suggest that you visit it with a guide",
          "The Museum of the Western Han Dynasty is at the site of the Mausoleum of the Nanyue King. This the oldest and largest of the Han Dynasty tombs and was found about 20 meters below the ground surface and discovered during excavation for a new building. Bright minds recognized",
          "Visited here to learn more about China and the area, it was a good exhibition but sort of small museum, the nice thing was we were able to purchase a three museum pass and visit another nearby museum the Sun Yat Sen Museum.",
          "Before this visit I did not know much about the Kings of southern China. The museum contains the relics found in king Zhao Mo's tomb, discovered in 1983. The museum is well laid out to tell the story, with information in Chinese and English. I joined the free conducted tour but",
          "We explored the original tomb to view the architecture, then visited the exhibition hall for the relics unearthed here and this province. It is an amazing place to learn the local history with only CNY12 for the entrance fee.",
          "We spend about 3 hours at the Museum of the Western Han Dynasty. It was interesting and informative about a time that we had not heard about. Friendly staff.",
          "the place has been protected... the information are enough to understand the history.. good preservation..",
          "This museum has a confusing number of levels. The lower floors are exhibits of various tomb materials from the Western Han Dynasty era. When we visited there was also an exhibit of about 200 Chinese ceramic pillows. All I can say is that by the time we reached the top level",
          "Interesting museum with tomb, jewelry , weapons , history , and admission was free that day when we was there",
          "If you have any interest in history, or archaeology, this is for you. Beautifully organised, great buildings. You clamber down into the burial chamber, then see many of the found artefacts upstairs. From stunning Jade suits to kitchen utensils. Well worth a visit.",
          "We spent about 90 minutes at this museum. Climbed three flights if stairs to see the original tomb which was found intact in 1983, 2000 years after the king's death. The tomb was intact so many beautiful treasures were found. I particularly liked the jade shroud the king was",
          "I truly loved this museum. It doesn't look like it was going to be amazing when I first entered but after buying my ticket for a small fee and paying the 100rmb deposit for my English audio guide I was happily surprised by what I found. The museum has several areas dealing with",
          "What a surprise! Initially, I thought it would be a quick \"in and out\" so-so visit. Especially since the beginning part is a bit slow and the Ushers are half asleep. But when one gets to the upstairs rear, it starts to get quite professional with exhibits well lit and",
          "This museum depicts the artefacts of Nan Yue King of Han Dynasty B.C. and it also entomb the mausoleum of this King at the back of this building. Entrance is for a fee & it is sad not all items displayed have English subtitles. Good to know this tomb is also more than 2000 yrs",
          "Museum is ok if u enjoy history. Nothing fancy or interesting like Qin dynasty museum in Xi'An. But was good break from the shopping.",
          "Strarting from the outside, the building is amazing giving you some nice feelings. The entrance fee was very low and a map of the museum is given when you enter inside. It is split in 10 areas each one with specific things. After some of the rooms, the way leads you to the tomb",
          "We enjoyed it a lot, interesting story, and a big bonus of information leaflets in English! It's cool that you can see inside the actual tomb. Plus it's easy to get there from the subway.",
          "Worth to visit. You will need at least 2 hrs for visiting the museum. So don't be late. There are 10 steps for visiting the museum. Follow them step by step.",
          "Well laid out museum and dig in the place the relics were discovered! The front part of the museum is only a taster - keep going out the back to the excavation site and through to the rest of the displayed artifacts. Lots of Jade - including the jade burial suit of the local",
          "This museum offers about 1000 artifacts, including the jade full burial suit sewn with red silk, and dozens of jade protective discs for the ruler, who was buried on the site of the museum. After his death, Four of his concubines were sacrificed, along with servants and",
          "to visit IF you have never seen a jade burial suit or a jade oroborous of which there are many. Whilst there is much to see, do bring a small torch as the museum proper lighting is inadequate. As one exits the museum front (where you entered), turn left and walk ~300 metres to",
          "This is truly a special site and is absolutely worth your time if you're looking to take a look into the history of the area. We went in not expecting to be able to go in the actual tomb. It was very neat and unlike any other experience I've had. If they know what's going on, it",
          "No photo taking is allowed in the museum which not only has the normal museum like exhibits but also the actual excavation site. The guide will explain how the bones were discovered and how the site was protected..very interesting.",
          "Read this thru trip advisor and allocated 2hrs. But it's totally not sufficient. Other than the tomb, there's also a exhibit on ancient ceramic pillows. A pretty large collection. The rest of the floors were about items that were part of the king's burial. Beautifully layout but",
          "Fascinating an thoroughly enjoyable attraction; probably the best tourist site in Guangzhou. Unmissable.",
          "Well worth a visit. Plan for at least one and a half hours to tour if you are a more casual museum observer (going through most rooms and reading a little along the way). Most of the exhibits on the eastern Han dynasty, which are in the main building, are not in English. If you",
          "Everything meaning jade suit for burial / weapons / cooking utensils / jade figurines / gold seals / special drinking cups and a unique piece of treasure ( a gold and bronze piece with Chinese characters for army commanders ) which has never been found anywhere in China. Well",
          "Nice piece of history, a lot of interesting objects, the thing is not everything is translated in english so that was a downside.",
          "Easily accesible, very economic entrance fee. The presentation of the exhibits was very nice, with clear and comprehensible translation in English. The lighting was amazing. Very impressive was the burial chambers. If you are visiting Guangzhou even for a short stay, you have to",
          "Far exceeded my expectations. Well planned out and wonderful information found everywhere in the museum in both English and Chinese. Would recommend to anyone.",
          "Very interesting 2,000 year old Tomb. Full of interesting relics and the most impressive burial garment. Almost like the terracotta warriors but this is for a King.",
          "I enjoyed going, my school which is the international college Guangdong Gangwai paid for us to visit. It was great practice for our chinese because all the tours and a good bit of the artifacts were all in chinese",
          "This museum is all about a fairly recently-discovered (in the 80's) burial chamber of the emperor of this part of southern China. You can visit the mausoleum itself, and then the museum which has all of the items discovered inside with good explanations and the history of the",
          "Excellent small museum, allow about 1.5-2 hours for your visit. Map available in English as were many of the labels describing the exhibits. Audio guide available in English for rent but I opted out. Superb collection of items excavated from the tomb of a Nanyue King (approx",
          "Mausoleum of nanyue king (its the king's tomb museum not to be confused with another nanyue museum featuring its garden which is free on beijing road) 12yuan per entry. Very well curated about the actual tomb site of king nanyue and its culture and funeral ritual and practices",
          "Great stop. One of the few museums I've been to in foreign country where pretty much every item has an English description. Plan around 2 hrs for your visit. Audio recording makes visit very enjoyable, any temporary exhibits are not on the audio. Audio is relatively short, yet",
          "The entrance fee is $12 CNY and the English audio headset is $10 CNY. The English is recorded in an American accent. I felt it added insight to the limited English in the museum. However, if you are not interested in technical details it will serve little interest. I recommend",
          "We found this museum very interesting- I would suggest climbing up to see the tomb first to help you get the treasures in perspective. The back museum building has better displays with English captions. If you have tired legs you might skip the front building (less important",
          "We spent about an hour at this place with an entrance fees of 12rmb each. Walk around the museum and the tomb, gives one a better understand of the Nan Wang history during his ruling. There are lots of treasure uncovered during the exacaution. All those can be seen at this",
          "The mausoleum is located in the city area of Guangzhou. It is not a large museum but it does have plenty of beautiful artifacts excavated. A brief history of Nanyue King is a plus. Worth a visit.",
          "We were awe by the digging n preservation of the tomb video. Very educational and rich in history. Son loved it",
          "Its a pretty small museum with a bit of history details here and there. Still worth for a visit and besides its free entrance no need to pay!",
          "The outside of the building is very deceptive, it looked very small, but actually the tomb site and another museum building are hidden behind. It displayed porcelain from early dynasties. There is a huge collection of porcelain pillows. The tomb site is behind the front building",
          "I've been living in Guangzhou for 1 year and have been to this museum 3 times. This is no doubt the best museum in Guangzhou, or maybe even in Guangdong. The antiquities and tomb are well preserved. If you're a big fan of ancient Chinese history, this is a must visit.",
          "But even for laymen, it is still amazingly preserved history of the Nanyue Kingdom more than 2000 years ago. The tomb of the second king was discovered in 1983 and thousands of relics were unearthed. Admission was very inexpensive and it's not as big as the Terracotta army",
          "This is close to a genuine archaeological experience. Much of the museum is presented \"in the raw\" - basically, you're on a suspended platform over the massive dig site. There are multiple exhibition rooms in the complex, so those truly interested will want to budget more time.",
          "It's not a huge museum but the artefacts on display are impressive. It's a fairly complete collection of the Nanyue Emperor's burial site. Lots of jade relics. Highlights: The emperor's jade burial suit.",
          "interesting place. has a mummy as well. you will not realize that you have a museum like this until you go inside the building. has English self guide as well so you will not lose your way inside the museum.",
          "The museum is devoted to the chance discovery of the tomb of an Han emperor and the terasures (and 15 sacrificial individuals) buried with him...a Chines Tut-ench-amun! The restoration of the grave side and the permanent exhibition are very well done...a must see when you are",
          "This museum provided great insights and information about the history from 2000 years ago of parts of China. The history unfolds through the relics and remains found in the tomb which forms part of this very large site. This museum also has an amazing collection of beautiful",
          "The museum's wonderful exhibits belie the initial impression that is generates outside. Thee are quality artefacts here that are cleverly curated.",
          "Very fancy setting for ancient items makes for a comfortable visit. Interesting that there are piles of cash left on some exhibits where there is not even a donation box. Chinese respect for the dead royalty or sympathy for the sacrificial attendants?",
          "Admission was 10 yuan and we headed here when the rain was poring. Our expectations were low but we were impressed. It is indeed and impressive grave they have dug out and the exhibition has an immense amount of artefacts and you are likely to spend more time here than you first",
          "Well curated displays, with adequate English signage. You can tell which artifacts the tour guides highlight because the glass cases are no longer clear from all the hands and faces pressing against it. Be sure to check out the collection of ceramic pillows.",
          "Went by Subway train, two stops from Gongyuanqian station,(turn left at top of Beijing Lu), NOT Beijing lu station. Directions at station easy to follow, turn right out of station walk about 100 metres and the ticket office will, if you show them your passport, give you a free",
          "This ancient tomb dating back to the Han Dynasty is perhaps Guangzhou's most surprising cultural relic. It is certainly its oldest. This is a good place to come on either or a rainy day or one of Guangzhou's frequent hot days. If the mercury is rising outside, you can always pop",
          "From the outside of the museum, it was quite small. That gave me a false impression altogether. When you entered to the Display Halls on the second floor, there was one of the largest display of ceramic pillows over the centuries. It also displayed a reconstruction of ancient",
          "We enjoyed this museum and its Air Conditioning! There was a room dedicated just to ancient Chinese pillows which was fascinating. The tomb is interesting and they have set it out quite well.",
          "The tomb itself is well-presented and preserved, providing an interesting insight into burial customs of the time. The preceding museum which one must enter prior to reaching the tomb is nothing great, but an additional museum up the hill and next to the tomb area is worth a",
          "This museum transports you back in time as you leave the modern world of Guangzhou and step back into old China. There are wonderfully displayed artifacts and new curiosities at every turn.",
          "The museum is pretty interesting and you can get up close to all the jades. I actually saw this as a touring exhibit in Cambridge a few years ago and was pleased to be able to see it in situ. The real shame is the way the the tomb is basically a free-for-all. The stone doors and",
          "Being the first museum we visited in China we were not disapointed. The museum is mainly about the discovery of the tomb of the Nanyue King of the Western Han Dynasty. The tomb was discovered in 1983. And the relics from the tomb are all displayed in the museum as well as the",
          "The Mausoleum of the Nanyue King is an accidental archeological find and is one of the most important historic discoveries in South China. The King's burial suit is made of thousands of jade tiles. The museum also traces the history of life hundreds of years ago with",
          "If you come to Guangzhou, please visit if you have time, we walked away from here feeling very inspired and educated that bit more. The Tomb Chambers and the Emperors Jade Burial Suit Wow! The preservation is amazing! Very good English descriptions everywhere which we were",
          "The jade burial suit is \"immortal\" but not the human remains. Ancient artefacts impart a sense of the depth and extent of cultural history. Clay figure of acrobats standing on each others' shoulders show skills still practised today.",
          "This was the best part of my visit to Guangzhou. Walk into the tomb first then view the exhibits which are well displayed with a fair amount of information. Amazing to walk into the actual tomb and read a bit about what (or who) were in the several rooms. Also on display was the",
          "The tomb and museum offer an insight into Imperial life. Access to the site is easy on the metro but be aware that there is little in the way of restaurants in the immediate are. I went to one place across the street and regretted it. The timing of your visit is also important.",
          "Place to visit if you love history or to kill some time. Museum is just few minutes walk from China Hotel. All kind of ancient jade treasure found from a king's tomb.",
          "The museums archite\u00e4ct shoud give his or her pens immediately away. I WOULD TAKE THAT from the exhibition designer as well. but the ancient material here hits the roof mmedeately. THIS IS THE tutankhamen of china. Do not miss. THE Best in Guangzhau.",
          "I have been to China more than 40 times and this museum stands out as one of my best memories. Guangzhou is not famous for \"big\" attractions, such as the Great Wall, but has many smaller experiences, such as this, that are really good. What makes this such a special experience",
          "It's a good museum to visit if you are into the Chinese culture and history. But if you get bored looking at jade pieces and porcelain pillows, this is not the place for you. What was worth the visit was definitely the tomb chambers and the emperors jade burial suit.",
          "I would put this on your must do list if you are interested in history and visiting Guangzhou. Staff speak basic English, and surprisingly the exhibits are well labelled both in English and Chinese. The museum is well laid out with clear signage. The tomb itself is the",
          "It was good to see bit of culture as being in Guangzhaou. A good past time . But well organized . Language is a problem in china that is why it is difficult for tourist .",
          "This is one of the best tomb museums in China. The reasons are because: 1. I love the way they preserve the tomb such that you can enter the different cubicles of the tomb. It is really an eye opening experience, made even better by the glass roof above the tomb. 2. The museum",
          "Easy accessible Museum, well organised, and very interesting. I really enjoyed it, you need about an hour, be aware that there are a few steps to be climbed",
          "This museum is a great way to get to know China before visiting the better known attractions. The tomb and remains of the Han Nan Yue King from over a 1000 years are fascinating to say the least, and unlike say the Ming tombs in Beijing, were discovered intact, untouched by",
          "The setting and presentation is brief and clear. It shows how well developed the city and its surrounding was 2000 years ago. A trading port right next to the river. The location of the tomb was carefully selected.",
          "A must view landmark celebrating a long forgotten tomb found during building construction. Plenty of information in English with an excellently curated museum section, the tomb itself is slightly mind blowing. I stood in a place last occupied over 1000 years before in a place",
          "Inexpensive ticket (12 yuans). Large collection of Chinese antiques with explanations in Chinese and English.",
          "Great Museum and Tomb and well worth the money (12 RMB) and the visit! A must for history lovers, one of the major archaeological discoveries in China. Its the Tomb and history of the second Nanyue King Zhou Mo, discovered back in 1983 fully intact with relics over 2000 years",
          "This tomb is a must see on any visit to Guangzhou. Gives an interesting glimpse into the ancient rituals of Guangdong. The tomb itself is fully preserved and the artifacts from it are on display in a museum.",
          "Definitely worth a stop here. Come in and see the tomb where the King's remains were found. Entry fee is only a couple of dollars.",
          "Not the tomb but the mausoleum. This ia one of the rare mansoleum that has been built above the tomb and only one in the region. Plenty of artifacts so a tour to Guangzhou is never complete until you visit this. Plan atleast half a day for this.",
          "This museum was renovated in 2010 and has won 6 architectural awards. However, you have to buy the 12 Yuan ticket to the museum from the obscure, old ticket window at the bottom of the stairs to the building, which doesn't even look open. (Most visitor to the building alight",
          "This is a tomb of an ancient ruler and his 15 buried alive servants. The ruler was covered with a jade suit. The tour consists of the tomb and an accompanying museum which displays the contents of the packed tomb. To be able to see an intact tomb is incredible.",
          "Unlike some other museums in China, this museum is not free. That means, visitors to this museum are relatively serious. Indeed, many free museums in China are somewhat like \"playground\" and very noisy. Well, this museum is not large but relativley well-displayed in Chinese and",
          "You kinda feel your Lara Croft as you descent down the underground tomb of the king and his mistress. The exhibits are pretty interesting and had informative labels. There's is also an audio visual section explaining the burial tradition used on the Nanyue King so you will",

          "Located very near to MRT station. Good exhibits, a tad crowded (Saturday morning), making the passage into the tomb structure rather stuffy and chaotic(Low beams, small passage and lots of people is not a good match :), a few bumps on the head here and there.",
          "A lot of exhibits. The red-walled structure cannot be missed when passing by. Is in a relatively older and quieter district of Guangzhou and thus a bit out of the way. Exhibits on display rather interesting and worth half a day of walking.",

          "Nice museum with extensive artifacts and inexpensive entry fee. Used the English audio tour, but really didn't need it, as there was English translation of the interpretive info. You can walk through the actual tomb, although quite crowded and the explanations of the artifacts",
          "Guangzhou seems to be rarely on tourist's trail, but in fact it can show as much as many other \"historical\" cities in China. This museum is a very good example. The first two floors were some pottery and porcelain pillows (!) that had very little to do with the mausoleum itself.",
          "Aspect to visit this museum in 1 hour after we had our breakfast. The place seems rather small but once we step in, the collections are quite complete since these artifatcs are dated back to years BC. It took us almost 3 hour to visit the whole museum.",

          "Travelled all the way to Shamian Island only to be very disappointed as we were unable to fully appreciate the historical area: 1. Signs are all in local language (Mandarin) and google translate does not translate well 2. Lack of activities (cultural events, etc) or guide/s to",

          "Great architecture and walking area. Nice place to sit around and enjoy a coffee or walk with friends. The French style buildings are very different from the newer sections of Guangzhou. Some restaurants too, but those are a bit touristy. Best in Spring as the flowers blossom.",

          "Ive actually been to Shamian a couple of times for the past 10 years. Never really walk around and explore. I used to come here to eat at the thai restaurant. A great place to soak the ambience of collonial time. Walk around and you will find a few nice cafe to take picture and",
          "Shamian Island was the most European part of Guangzhou. The large mansions and tree-lined boulevards make it a distinctive area to explore. Unfortunately most of the buildings are in disrepair. It takes time and money to return Shamian to its original grandeur.",
          "Right in the busiest part of the Guangzhou metropolitan area, Shamian is somewhat different from the rest of city in that it is an island; with limited access to private vehicles and no public transport, it is comfortable to walk around and feel the life in Guangzhou city as if",
          "We enjoyed an afternoon walk around Shamian Island, and it tree shaded streets. The best part was walking on the central pedestrian walkway which extends through the central part of this man-created island, for at one time it was not separated by water from the main portion",
          "It is really not an island. More like a park with trees, plants, shrubs, buildings, sculptures. Nice place to take photos though. You can walk past the park to the river bank to watch sunset",

          "This old colonial enclave, now overgrown with giant shady fig trees, is a calm escape from nearby downtown Guangzhou. A short walk from the Cultural Park metro station, towards the river, with a series of intimidating highways next to it, it is quite enchanting to walk through",
          "Good place to visit after busy day or when you feel tired of crowded areas. Good for walking have nice old town and some good open air restaurant. Easy to find from metro line 6 culture park or line 1 huangsha station.",
          "The buildings are looking a little rundown and very few are actually accessible! I\u2019m sure they would\u2019ve been beautiful back in the day.

          "A gorgeous place to wander and enjoy the locals social scene. The park area is lovely, there is restaurants and cafes dotted around the island and it is clean and well looked after. A stroll through the park next to the pearl river will take you past card games, dancing, tai",

          "I prefer this area to stay it is quiet and relaxing. It is easy to walk to restaurants from here. Around this area there also many things of historic interest. It is also worth a visit to the Chinese Medicine centre on Shamian Beijing.",
          "A nice reprieve from the busy city buzz, it\u2019s peaceful and laid back and usually not crowded. They maintain gorgeous gardens year-round; you\u2019ll also find a lovely church and a pretty Starbucks on the island. If you\u2019re looking for a good place to stroll around in GZ, try out",

          "Not so big as Shanghai bund, still could see plenty old western style buildings, and some very old trees inside. Some building is now used as Hotel. One more thing I like is the sculptures inside, indicating what is the city like hundurd years ago",

          "Visited this island today. There is nothing extra-ordinary about this island which has old houses and only a few nice buildings. Did not see any shops or people inside the buildings. A spot of this island on the Pearl River has a nice small park. We spent about twenty minutes",
          "The old European buildings are pretty, however, poorly maintained and there are no real shops, businesses and people inside these buildings, rendering these buildings as \u2018lifeless\u2019 which is a real pity. The statues are also not well-maintained. Over-rated and a popular site",

          "Great place for a different side of Guangzhou, we walked around the whole island, a nice mix of architecture, it can be done in a couple of hours. The White Swan hotel is there, an elegant hotel back in the day. Well worth checking out.",

          "Although I think some people really appreciate this place, which I totally respect, I personally did not see something recommend. It is somewhat far way from Tianhe (New Downtown). Trying to get a taxi back took us about 40 minutes as the hotel in this island tried calling but",
          "Shamian Island is really nice with plenty of trees and old colonial buildings. However, I found this to be boring. I can see the appeal for other people though. The most interesting thing I saw were the fishermen's catches. They had turtles, snakes and different interesting",

          "Does not take long to see the whole island but come see it. Then see the medicine market across the road and take the metro to the pet market (just don't buy anything from there). You can see how animals are treated in some places in China.",
          "An interesting snapshot of Guangzhou from a previous era, stately mansions and office buildings. Well worth the visit",
          "Shamian Island was quite boring tbh. I think the biggest regret was not knowing that we couldn't access anything Google related (play store especially!) in China and so we were unable to download the apps that were used to rent bikes easily accessible in the whole of Guangzhou.",
          "We went out on a sunny day and found this place quite relaxing and nice to walk for a couple of hours. It has good food stores and it is not too crowded. I recommend a visit.",
          "Nice place to hang out if you have nothing much to do. European colonial buildings and gardens for photo shoot. Along the river, some local entertainment playing musical instrument during our visit. Had a nice meal at Lucy's cafe by the river park, much like Jack's Place",

          "The island consist of the main street and another 5 street. You can cover the tiny island in 45 minutes or less. There were many bridal photo shooting that day. I guess it is the european style church building there. Surprisingly there is a primary school. It is a good walk and",
          "Seeing all the good reviews about Shamian Island, I decided to made a visit here. Honestly, I don't quite understand all the hype about this place. I walked around about half an hour and left as I just wasn't feeling it. Maybe I made the wrong choice of coming here during a hot",

          "Pls dont go. There was really nothing much to see. Was cheated by trip advisor :( it was like walking a stroll in the park. N we were so tired since we had to carry my baby and the stroller up the bridge to see this! A no no from me.",

          "We love this place. It's architecture, lovely restaurants, park and river walk. Close to a large shopping mall across the river. Just walk over the bridge. Grab morning or afternoon tea at the TOUS les JOURS patisserie at the mall. This is like a little piece of heaven amongst",
          "Nothing except starbucks and catholic church is here. The view to the river is not so good, the place is dark at night",
          "Think I got my hopes too high. It's nothing I imagined. The water surrounding the island is foul smelling. Architectures were slightly interesting - different from the rest of the city, but not worth travelling all the way there for it.",

          "Visited this place on 5 Nov. The european buildings are nice looking but the entire place looks some needed maintenance e.g. trimming of grass or tree. It wasn't a nice walk along the street because most of the time I was trying not to photobomb people who are taking",
          "Nothing special. All the westerners rave about the starbucks there. Who would travel for a starbucks?",
          "Coming from Singapore with some colonial buildings, the buildings in Shamian Island are nothing new nor appealing in any manner. It is a relaxing stroll through the many lanes. The interesting part is the many bronze statues all over the place.",
          "If one wants to experience the China of yesteryears,the Shaman Island is the place. Surrounded by water on all sides, with magnificent bridges to the main land, parks and hotels of beautiful architecture of the late 19th. century, it is a destination. Eat in one of the outdoor",
          "We went in the early evening for a leisure stroll. Saw a model for a fashion magazine taking pictures for the clothes brand and the place has a nice Starbucks, making an ideal location for some laid back time and chilling out. Also saw a wedding at the chapel :) nice",

          "It is hard to believe this is an island. Located by the Pearl River, there are many European buildings besides the street, you can see many new couple taking wedding photos here. For me, it not that special as I have seen the European architectures. Try to taste the Cantonese",
          "This spot is good to walk around and relax, play some games in the park or take some nice photos. Make sure it's a nice day, on a rainy day will not be nice, suggest not to go on a weekend as well as it will be full. The Starbucks is a very old historical building, quiet nice.",

          "It's a good place to visit for a afternoon walk and to take photos in area with European designed buildings.",
          "You could probably walk around the island in maybe an hour. Old buildings, a few restaurants. It's quiet. The weekend I was there, saw lots of models being photographed.",
          "On one side of the road, a whole stretch of dried seafood, herbs etc, all bustling. A different architecture across the road beckons. I Cross over the bridge and walk further in, and I found myself in another world of tranquility.",
          "Shamian Island is a very idyllic place in Guangzhou. It takes you away from the busy streets, traffic and noise. Its tranquil, and has a western look and feel to it. A romantic getaway and many people take their wedding shots here. you'll probably stumble upon a few brides and",
          "The island is very walk able with nice architecture and loads of history. Its more western than the rest of Guangzhou.",
          "Amys Place and a Gift For Orphans were both fun Stores. Use the Restrooms in the White Swan, though that was a bit crowded for me. I would not want to stay at that hotel as it is a real tourist attraction. But, it is fun to walk around lobby and see the pretty things they have",
          "This place is a bit overrated. It was not that european. The whole island is not fully pedestrianized so you should be careful of cars passing thru. The whole island feels new and lacks sould and character",
          "Escape from the hurly-burly and use the Metro to travel to this peaceful oasis which features French and British early 20 Century architecture. The island is divided by a leafy avenue featuring at regular intervals quaint sculptures. Along the way you will see a beautiful",

          "We loved Shamian Island for the history. Buildings are maintained from their original construction and is very different than the rest of the city. Easy to get to by cab, or by bus. Island is about 4 blocks by 6 blocks, and is easy to walk around. Could be difficult to get",
          "The colonial style houses are nice and the area is kept very clean and accessible, nice for a stroll. Just across the bridge you get to the traditional medicine market which is very interesting and a complete contract.",
          "An island across the Pearl river, nice and quiet atmosphere: no cars, relatively no crowds even on weekends. Beatiful historical buildings all have descriptions now occupied by government offices, trees, flowers and intricate sculpters of people make it a pretty suitable place",
          "Near to mtr, walk over to overhead bridge. Nice cozy place with colonial buildings, near the river too. Didnt see any makan or selling drinks!",
          "I enjoyed the atmosphere, natural environment and old style buildings on the easter half of the island but not the other half which was added on with modern style building.",
          "It is the must visit place in the whole of Gaungzhou as it's situated along the famous pearl river. SHAMIN island has many scenery locations as well having beautiful heritage building which certainly have a British arcitecture presence . I usually visit this beautiful local",
          "This is a lovely place to visit different than other places in GZ. Old style buildings lovely gardens and statues. Very relaxing place to visit. When you are in this area worth going to the fish markets a real eye opener. Interesting to see all the things they sell.",
          "Honestly I'm not fans of architectural, thus my review could be unreliable. I just visit it with my husband and friend. None of us show excitement to the place. I fine it just ok to relax, walking around, jogging, but it is not the place that will take breath away. Any",
          "This is my first time been this place. Different environment than other GZ place. Old style European building, church... you can imagine long time ago only foreigners and rich people can stay there. What a lovely place. Look like Macau street.",
          "Colonial style houses, tree-shaded streets and a nice park and interesting history were features of Shamian Island. We took the metro to Huangsha station then asked locals for directions. We had a nice lunch at Lucy's restaurant in the park.",

          "If you like the old days, you here. Do not wait for old things here and building era Ch'in(Qin). The maximum that you can find - the 19th century when China was ruled by Britain and France, while the Chinese are not allowed to come to the island of Shamian. This is the place",

          "This is a great quick getaway from the hustle and bustle of the big city Guangzhou. It is small, quaint and brimming with history. The only issue is making sure you get a taxi driver that doesn't rip you off taking you back to your hotel.",
          "Most of the historical buildings including some Consulate General have already been occupied as modern Chinese Government offices, hotel or restaurant, but the streetscape and the facades of existing buildings have been preserved so that a visitor could feel the atmosphere as if",
          "Most people will tell you to visit Shamian Island if you're a westerner because of the colonial buildings which are now mostly international consulate offices. It's not a place to spend a whole day buy worth a day trip because it's easily accessible from the metro and you can",
          "I enjoyed walking round Shamian Island its nice to see the old European style buildings. I was there at the hottest part of the day in the middle of summer which I would not recommend. I will visit this place again later in the year when the weather has cooled down.",

          "It's almost a walking tour around amidst the buildings erected for use by the Westerners during its heyday. It has now been converted for other use & it tells of the place during their prime controls the export of slavery & also import of opium into China. Many bronze figures",
          "If you have ever sern a Spanish ramblas, French square, English Park or German shopping street, don't botter going here. There is much more interesting stuff in Guangzhou than this for Europeans! For Asian people thus can be different off course...",
          "It's a really beautiful and historical place. It's peace and silent place but will get crowded during the weekend, cuz many people will take wedding photos there. Unlike the Starbucks in the central city, the one inside is quite a great place to relax.",

          "The island is full of old buildings and nice streets. I loved it and I had the chance to see the old city a little bit. Once in the island, you forget guangzhou, the huge megacity with all the skyscrapers and endless highways. If you visit guangzhou I consider this definitely a",
          "a must see in Guangzhou - stay there if you can , calm and unique , check out the institute of chinese medicine and the vegetarian restaurant",
          "It's a small island with Western buildings left from French and English concessions of the 1800. You can walk along the river, you can eat probably one of the best Thai food in town at Cow & Bridge. There are still many consulates and if i am not wrong, white swan hotel is",
          "My business partner brought me here for lunch and I had the opportunity to do some walk around before another meeting. I really enjoyed the architecture here. Among the very typical Chinese-city feel surrounding Shamian Island, in this cluster, you find some colonial buildings",
          "Staying in the White Swan hotel during my visit, which is located in Shamian Island, i walked the island around many times. It is really beautiful, it has some stores with turist stuff and very nice restaurants by the river. The most amazing restaurant in Shamian was not by the",
          "Quite the contrast from the rest of bustling Guangzhou, Shamian Island captures a glimpse of the 19th century colonial heritage. The cobbled streets are lined with 150 year old trees, and the range of British and French architecture makes for a pleasant walk. Unlike many cities",
          "Only one word, Beautiful! I am happy we went there. Absolute worth it. It was raining that day a lot, but we made the best out of it. There were a lot wedding couples for pictures that day, I felt a little sorry for them, but they also made the best out of it. Some of them",

          "We ventured here as we had some time to spare - beautiful shady tree lined streets and interesting old buildings. It's beautifully manicured and there were lots of families out enjoying the weekend sun. There is a few shops but most seemed quite expensive after other places",
          "Shamian is a small island of historic significance because of its connection to European colonisation and trade. Its a bit of a trip across town from the new centre of Guangzhou but worth it. You can walk around the whole island in a short time, and it has too much cheap tourist",
          "Most of the buildings were built during the period where the Europeans had a lot of influence on the Chinese culture, so you see a lot of that. There's also a lot of bronze statues showing the period of change (clothing, activities, dresses) happening in China during that time.",
          "The buildings are beautiful, well at least the ones that are being maintained - which is the majority of them. The greenways are very pretty. There is a nice area to walk by the river. The only thing that was very annoying was there were 7 couples that I counted taking wedding",
          "Guangzhou is not a touristy city to enjoy but business oriented. However, Shamian Island a a decent place to visit to kill some time and buy souvenirs, if you happen to be in Guangzhou you must visit this place!",
          "Tranquil. Peaceful. Real. It's truly an oasis in the crazy busy GZ. My 68/74 years old parents enjoyed the quietness of Shamian tremendously. Mom would like to stay at the White Swan next time instead of in Tianhe just to be in Shamian. It's a very lived in neighbourhood,",
          "We visited in the afternoon on a weekend. There were some people but not crowded at all. I had a enjoyable walk among this area. There's plenty of trees and resting area for people to chat and rest. I had a coffee at Starbucks there. It must have been the best looking Starbucks",
          "The trees that lined the Shamian Island seeps history and elegance as with the architecture of the buildings there. There are also very interesting and amusing sculptures that dotted around this place! The architecture around that place reminds me of old Shanghai - I was",

          "Shamian Island captures the essence of a fantastic place to be. It is a magnificent little island and an idyllic suburb full of parks and interesting sculpture. There are more trees than buildings \u2013 and most of the buildings are historically interesting even though they are only",
          "Wonderful examples of British and French architecture in China from the time when Guangzhou was the only port allowed to conduct trade with the rest of the world. Have a look at the Starbucks - probably the best looking one I have ever seen (but don't bother getting a coffee -",

          "I fell in love with this place immediately and walked here from my hotel quite a few times during my stay. It's so peaceful. Being right on the water, the scenery is just beautiful. The statues are pretty interesting but capture the history of the little island. While you're",

          "Stayed at a hotel on the Island for a week. This place is really nice. The people were very friendly, it's close to lots of shopping and attractions, close to the subway and the island itself has a lot of very nice restaurants and lounges. The traffic is very light considering",

          "Stayed here for four days; it's a pleasant little place but nothing beyond that really - no 'attractions' as such just a nice walk. The downside of staying is the canal and the subsequent issue with mosquitos-well worth avoiding.",

          "Horrible place if you want to take nice pictures of GuangZhou. First of all, I came at about 4h00PM and it took me 30min of waiting to buy tickets, and 30min to take elevator. Then, when you finally reach the top, it was overcrowded, there was so much noice (chinese people",
          "We went for high tea at the Lucerne restaurant on the 105th floor. The view and experience were fabulous. We were able to go up to the observatory floors afterwards to see the sunset and city at night.",
          "One of the best attraction in Guangzhou. Best time to visit during night time when it lit up with different type of lights.",
          "Spectacular views of Guangzhou. Recommend visiting towards end of day so you can also see city lit up at night. Liked the \u201cbubble ride on edge at top of tower.",
          "I came from Toronto, Canada expecting to take the ride in the bubble carts + see the sights however, nobody was able to tell me that it was Out of service for a while and was scheduled to be available at 5pm. I learned about all of this at 12 noon.",

          "Because it is one of the highest platforms in the world we visited Guangzhou Tower. The views are incredible and the ride on the bubble tram is great. However you pay almost \u20ac 50,.. For entrance. Don't forget to bring your passport...",

          "We went on our dinner cruise and enjoyed the views and lightshow including the Canton Tower. An extremely tall building in a city with thousands of multi-storey buildings stands over everything else. Well worth a visit to Guangzhou.",
          "It\u2019s iconic tower in Guangzhou downtown. See it from different views. I found best from Four seasons hotel\u2019s 99th floor. Lighting is amazing. Worth the see",

          "I\u2019ve been in towers all over the world, however the picturesque scenery of the night lights revealing the modern center on Guangzhou admired under free sky at over 450m is breathtaking. You have a thrilling ride on top too, I suggest the full ticket price (398 yuans). Passport",
          "Go straight and get 488M tickets to experience the best view. You will avoid all the crowd in any of the lower view deck. They only allow 40 people on the highest deck. If you can afford the price and have time, purchase all in 1 ticket, RMB398. Try to get a Chinese friend to",

          "The ticket gets you up to the top floor where you walk around and have a 360 view but taking photos is not great as there is alot of reflection at night. You go up, walk around and back down in 10 minutes, fun but disappointed that this was all to it",
          "If you\u2019ve only got a few hours to kill and have a limited budget, the metro rail takes you right to most places for very cheap. The tower was one stop on our itinerary and gave us a nice layout and aerial pics of places we had already visited. Finished with a lunch downstairs",
          "I started with a dinner, followed by a tour at the top, around 1/2 km above ground level. Very well organised; excellent elevators; stunning views.",
          "The view at night is amazing! There are some \u201cgames\u201d on top of the tower (if you are not to scared). Usually is gonna be full of people so choose a non-holliday day to go and try to be there for sunset \ud83d\ude09",
          "I would usually never say this, but buy the most expensive ticket so you get out of the star observatory. I bought the 150 CNY ticket and the observatory was loud, the facade of the tower blocked your view and there was lots of glare on the glass at night. I paid 100 CNY to do",
          "The Canton Tower is definitely a must when visiting Guangzhou, it\u2019s an amazing landmark with great views. Access was easy and elevator ride to top was fun. The surrounding plaza can be very congested and is safe for travelers, but I would suggest you watch your belongings.",
          "You do not have to be at the Canton tower itself to see it, best viewed from a distance away by staying at a hotel near Zhujiang (Pearl River). The colourful rainbow lighting from this tower is certainly a sight to behold and the ever changing patterns are amazing and",
          "The Canton Tower is truly iconic and majestic. It is definitely worth a visit at night to watch the light show, its truly an awesome experience.",
          "Came here as it was one of the main attractions in Guangzhou. Even though you have an unrivaled view of Guangzhou, when you are inside the tower it feels like they are trying to hard. I felt for what you pay as an entrance fee was not worth it. There are a variety of tickets",
          "Seems to be one of the newest landmarks in Guangzhou. Beautiful place especially when all lighted up by night.",
          "My only suggestion for Trip Advisor users is to purchase the bubble tram ticket even if it is expensive. This is the only way to enjoy the view from the top. The view from the observatory deck is really poor due to the external structure of the tower that limits what you can",
          "We have been travelling in China for nearly two months now. This 'attraction' must take the prize for the worst price/value ratio of anything we have seen. It's just too darn expensive for what it's offering.",
          "The views are great, but the entrance fee is crazy even by Chinese standards. Go there only if you have a huge amount of money and no idea how to spend it",

          "Similar to many towers like this, nighttime views from the observation deck are best. At night the city is lit up, and some buildings are ever changing in colors. Also, the tower itself is the most beautiful of the nighttime colored structures.",
          "I loved the commanding views. I enjoy being downtown. It realky is a place to get lost and eat some great food and an exceptional environment!",
          "A must visit, Cloud observation deck, Buffet restaurant, sky bar, Bubble tram, mesmerized with the arrangement. Only they accept Alipay, Wechat and Yuan. They dont outside accept cards.. pl carry cash. Even the photo shops gives u photos on wechat, they dont use google/ email",

          "This place is good to visit since you'll get to see the area in 360deg view. And if you love some adrenalin rush you can try the rides on top. LG technology display is included inside. It's my first time in Guangzhou and this place made me realize how China made it big on trades",

          "The Tower can be seen throughout Guangzhou. It is a very poplar site for visitors. You can purchase tickets on line. Lines are very long especially at night to see Guangzhou's night lights. I wen in the day time and lines were very short. You need your passport for ticket",

          "Canton tower is a good landmark to visit while at Guangzhou. However going up is pricey and messy, with very long queue. There are some restaurants, very expensive, but food quality is just so-so. The restaurants also closed very early at around 9.30pm. We were dining at 110th",
          "Nice place to go at night but be aware that there\u2019s always been crowded specially weekends. Really beautiful night view..",

          "It\u2019s a mesmerizing place. Colorful light beams, colorful sky, music., basically it\u2019s a happening place in the night. At around 8 -9 pm water fountains with colorful lights and music starts in canton squire. You can sit on Pear river bank and enjoy the sight of mighty Canton",
          "Went there by subway, getting off at the Chigang Pagoda station. Had a late dim-sum lunch at \"Chopstix\"restaurant in the basement which was almost deserted at that time. Then we purchased rmb150 Zone E tickets to get to the highest viewing floors. Hardly any queue when we were",
          "Being in the dentist's chair kept me very quiet while I looked at Guangzhou's iconic Canton Tower. This time I got to see it from a different height and perspective. The most marvelous time to view it is at night when it is beautifully lit up.",

          "Entrence fee is very high. Most of the time during my trip inside of clouds. Enterence is very poor. Find something more interesting instead of to visit tower if it is rainy.",
          "It\u2019s an amazing tower. Looks wonderful in night with Color changing lights. Beautifully decorated. Must watch",

          "Visited with relatives, place is within walking distance from Huacheng Square, the view from the top was really impressive, make sure you pick a day with a nice weather otherwise the fog and pollution will definitely disappoint and spoil the view. What I really didn't like was",

          "The best view in Guangzhou is from the top of the Canton Tower. If there is only one place to go, this has to be at the top of the list. At the top of the tower there are two levels inside at the top and then one level at the very top. The two inside levels are very spacious",
          "Completely different than CNtower or any other towers. In evening colourful light work what they have done is amazing. I Didn't went in to the tower, I was in the boat ride in the river and saw it for an hour. One must do their river boat ride as well.",

          "I don\u2019t have much to say about the Canton Tower. I didn\u2019t visit it from the inside because I find these towers to be the same, so after visiting a few, you no longer have interest in doing so anymore. But it\u2019s a nice view from the outside, and good to take a couple photos",
          "The highest tower in Guangzhou . Nice place to see the city from the sky. Unfortunately we have been there in a cloudy day so we couldn\u2019t see everything we hoped. We will come back in October!",

          "Getting to Canton Tower is a hassle if you intend to take APM train. It's always jam packed. We gave up after seeing 4 sardine packed trains one after another. Buying tickets is not foreigner friendly cos passport's not acceptable. You need to generate a foreigner ID in another",
          "The view is just awesome, however the ticket prices are just absurd. 150yuan for the lowest floor, and DOUBLE the price for the bubble tram and skydive. We are unlucky and picked a cloudy day so the view wasn't that especial, but still was nice. Also, the photos they take",
          "The Canton Tower was the absolute highlight of Guangzhou. It's a beautiful building and the colourful lighting at night makes it very nice to watch. I could literally stand there for 30 and just watch it cycle through different colours. Take a stroll alongside the river and",

          "Spent 2 hours in line just for nothing, take a pics and have to pay huge amount of money. This is a robbery. Not recommended at all. U wasting time n money, better plan a romantic dinner in fancy restaurant. Staffs are confusing, nothing good to say. First time visiting and",
          "The Canton Tower is the most famous landmark in Guangzhou. If you visit Guangzhou, then you must definitely experience the Canton Tower. You can go either during the day or evening. However, the evening is more interesting with a popular light show and a lot of activities",

          "Not to be missed. There is so much to do around and within the vicinity. My only beef is that they keep posting outside the ticket booth the Observatory/Day Cruise at Y170 but in reality totally unavailable. We even went back twice but to no avail. I think they put it there to",
          "Love the view at night time , we really recommend to everyone here . A bit expensive 290\u00a5 Chinese currency . Must calm for making a role following the line as more local Chinese people there. Waiting more than an hour a line. Love this place .",

          "Amazing views from the top observation deck, especially while sitting in the bubble cars that ride on the edge of the building. It\u2019s an absolute must, but make sure you are not afraid of heights otherwise you won\u2019t enjoy yourself at all!",
          "Very nice place for foreign visitors and lots of different choices to enter the tower. Those options satisfy a wild variety of tastes (from calm to radical people). 3 hours are enough to visit it.",
          "You just have to do it. And make sure to include the little bubble cars around the top. Amazing. Make sure you go at night to see the city lights.",
          "I\u2019ve seen this tower many times as it always seems to appear on the horizon when getting around the city. At night it\u2019s full of neon colour and in the day is grey with an interesting modern design. From close up it\u2019s interesting but there\u2019s not much going on in the area. Most",
          "I unfortunately didn\u2019t have the chance to take the inside tour to canton Tower however I really enjoyed se the tower changing colors all night and taking wonderfull photos.it\u2019s a must go",
          "This is a must see in this city. Do your research on the busy times of the day and week as it can get very busy. Must take your passport with you to buy tickets to go up the tower and see the observation levels. Height is not for the faint hearted but fantastic for the",
          "Went to visit tower with a large group. Access was easy and elevator ride to top was good speed and not scary. Views are terrific and it provides a great view of the CBD and surrounding areas of the City of Guangzhou. Make sure you bring ID preferably passport for security",
          "Good place with a nice view of GZ city. The entry to the tower is a bit complicated but the staff is quite helpful. Over all - worth a quick 1 hour visit",
          "What an experience! This is a once in a lifetime experience. We went to the revolving restaurant for dinner and the spread was incredible. The experience of waking on a glass floor at that height is mind blowing.",
          "The Tower is best appreciated, in my view, by taking a river cruise and observing it from the decks of your cruiser, as we did fairly recently. The night lights are dazzling since they provide a kaleidoscopic array of colours and spotlight beams.It is also worth visiting its",
          "Another Tower with a nice view. Of course the Bubble Tram was is something special. Prices where more than I expected (lease see attached price info} and expensive for china prices. Better value options are to take a \"Afternoon Tea\" option from 4pm onwards at 417m or so at",
          "Took a ferry at night and it was really beautiful. Cool breeze, and beautiful lights. Canton tower looks really magnificent upfront. Ticket price ranging from 50-200 RMB. Must see place in Guangzhou.",
          "Easy access via metro line. Beautiful at night! Once you are there, go to the riverside for a walk. Pretty skyline.",
          "Popular attraction, when arriving get a ID from the machine at the ticket office before lining up to purchase ticket, suggest also pay for the outdoor glass bubble that rides outside and around the top of the tower.",
          "We went there thinking that it would be place more for tourists however it wasnt it was just a place full of chinese pushing n shoving to buy tickets. Worse part is they have this stupid policy that you bring your passport in order to buy a ticket. We didnt even know this stupid",
          "Very impressive views of an impressive city. Beautiful building outside. Fast elevator to the 433 meter high panorama view. Also interesting floor with all the techniques explained. Night views are best I think, as dayview csn be less than hoped for because of air pollution.",
          "Spectacular views with changing lights. This is a amazing landmark and very beautiful. But It was very expensive so I did't go up. You should at least consider the weather before purchase tickets. The surrounding plaza is very crowded but it should be pretty safe for travelers,",
          "Easily accessible by metro subway line, this should be a no brainer \"can't miss\" on a trip to Guangzhou. there are several levels of accessibility depending on the fee you pay, and I am not daring enough to try the dangling cable car ride around the top... but the views are",
          "I went to the 450m observation deck. Very disappointing. The bubble cars which are an extra 180 yuan completely block the view. Felt cheated.",
          "Canton tower tallest building with iconic view of guangzhou city. Especially visit in evening when all the colourful lights makes it mesmerising and more beautiful. A souvenir complex on the ground level. Restaurant on upper levels.",
          "I loved the fact that the tower lights up at night. We went up the tower in the day time, what a beautiful view!",
          "Canton Tower is a must visit destination while you visit Guangzhou either for business or holiday purpose, strongly recommended to visit on evening time as the lighting effect was fantastic. Strongly recommended.",
          "The Canton Tower is a must see when visiting Guangzhou. It is a very clean place to visit and the lights are absolutely beautiful to view",
          "Had some free time on recent business trip so went up the tower. Midweek so not too busy and scored a sunny day. If your going to the top the bubble car is a must. Great view of the city.",
          "I went to see this tower during the day. Great view of the city. At night this place is really beautiful. Great to watch the lights display at a nearby park",
          "It says on here that open until 11pm but we got there at 10:30 pm sat. Night and it was closed so beware. Did not have time to come back. Still looked gorgeous from the outside.",
          "After 3 yrs in China one has seen for the enough towers for the rest of his life. And the view by night is always the same too. If you get a day with relatively clean air otherwise useless.",
          "The tower offers amazing views and is ultra modern. Though people tend to sit around the edges and block that view. (They really need to install some benches away from the windows) I think the best view of the tower is from the river or a bridge or the square immediately",
          "Good place to go. Slightly overrated. But had good time. Printing pictures are expensive again. Food shop was good. I would recommend to visit during the weekdays. N try to get the night view. Last time to enter the building is 7.30pm",
          "This is a must visit sight to see when in Guangzhou...especially at night. If you love the light of a city skyline you must come. Additionally, there are activities such as a sky drop ride and a slanted enclosed buggy ride around the top.",
          "Awesome views,awesome city,great food and people. Went to the movies in the tower. The movie played in English with Chinese subtitles.",
          "You will appreciate Canton Tower at Night because it lights up with different colors. I wasnt able to try the activities offered inside the Canton Tower but the scenic park is really great.",
          "Easy access by public transportation. Need to input your personal data, snap photo with the data entry machine. And print the slip before proceed to the ticket counter for ticket to enter the tower.",
          "Was very nice but a lot of procedures before entering the tower you must queue up and register plus take picture but price is quite cheap 228RMB for the 114 Floor",
          "I had a great time visiting the Canton Tower. I went for the cheapest ticket 150RMB (observation deck 2). The views were great! At night time is a great time to visit to see the various city lights and to see the tower changing lights. When you arrive from the metro there are",
          "Really enjoyed visiting the Canton Tower, went for the basic RMB 150 ticket which takes you to 2 observation levels including access to the active and passive damping system (a must if you are interested in Architecture & Engineering). The views are great providing you visit on",
          "Beautiful view at night when it\u2019s all lit up plus you can go on one of the cruises on the pearl river comes to life with all the lights",
          "I\u2019ve visited many tall buildings and after a while they all seem the same. Glass floor, cool photo ops, and killer views. That goes for the 3rd tallest building in the world, except the additional attractions at the top! In addition to the above the top floor allows the option",
          "It\u2019s an amazing building with different colours. You can see it from any angles in GZ. Lots of famous landmarks and amazing views around Canton Tower. It\u2019s worthy going for a visit.",
          "its an amazing experience though very cold at the top and also has amazing technologies by the Chinese at the rooftop that everyone would love to experience.",
          "This is a great visit along with the bubble ride at the top of the tower. The kids and adults will love it. Just make sure that you plan to go on a clear day and when it is NOT a Chinese national holiday (massive queues).",
          "It\u2019s one of the biggest landmarks in Guangzhou, and is something you should definitely see if you have the time. It\u2019s great to see the huge city from the sky, and the ticket price for going to the Star Observation Desk, 150 Yuan, is very reasonable. There\u2019s not a lot of",
          "Amazing beauty of the Canton Towers especially at night, the colours change it is strikingly beautiful, one can get carried away for hours. During the day it is the ideal place for a photo shoot. the views from seating area is stunning.Please make two trips one in the day, where",
          "Another must see while visiting Guangzhou! This is one of the tallest buildings in Southeast Asia. Although we did not go inside, we admired it from our hotel (Four Seasons), especially at night when the tower changes to a myriad of colors!",
          "Beautiful spot to walk nearby area and take good photos, not many branches (almost none) to seat around... u can also enjoy the fountain show and take great shoots if u like photography as I Do!:)",
          "The tower is a must to see when you visit Guangzhou, it is really spectacular, you can see the whole of Guangzhou from the top, you carry your ID or passport with you, and if you are over 60 ask for the senior rate , it is 50% off",
          "I stayed at several of the guangzhou top tourist spots and learned a great deal about this area of China.This was one of my most enjoyable moments during all of my trips",
          "very good location to visit, especially at night. you can see the different between the river, go there at night",
          "Really tall and beautiful tower in Guangzhou. We can say it is the landmark of the Guangzhou. The lights on the outside of tower is beautiful. Taking photos like this the popular way :)",
          "It is a very iconic tower in Guangzhou. easy to recah by MTR. Beautiful at night. Can change its colour every 5-10minutes ( dont know the exact time ). A very must visit place if you are in Guangzhou. should try the tourist tram that price ony RMB2.",
          "This building is so cool and a definite must do. The view from up in the bubble tram is amazing. This is a little pricey compared to most everything else in China. The price for the Bubble tram and everything else below is about 50 dollars a person but it is a must do.",
          "Beautiful tower goes up to 460m high. Great 360 view at night and the bubble ride was awesome. Tower itself is 600 m high. It's beautifully lit at night.",
          "So, after paying a fee, which depends on the height you go, and after riding in a super fast escalator that is usually mega packed with people, you will reach a sight for sore eyes, and by that I mean you will quite literally be in the thick of Chinas pollution, it will give you",
          "Canton tower is an amazing building. The lights at night are beautiful and I could watch the colours change for hours. Our trip up the tower was quite disappointing due to the extremely poor visibility. We did enjoy the elevator ride up, but the view from both the platforms",
          "i just pass by i feel comfort and i feel cold too i have no time to review as well but i will come back soon in summer",
          "Canton Tower is the Heart of Guangzhou, you can check it almost from anywhere in the city. It is very beautiful, and is actually a Beautiful man made structure. I would definitely suggest people to visit this place with family. And then take a stroll near the bay area. A MUST GO",
          "Was a murky day so I didnt go to the top. But its an impressive tower from below. Lights up in different colours. Great photos available. Its architechure is pretty cool. has its own metro station canton tower. If in GZ definatley have to check this out",
          "it was a so-so experience for me because I have been to other towers in other countries. Basically, they are all the same. You go to the top, you stay at the observatory and look down the city. Compared to the tokyo, shanghai and seoul tower, this has to be the worst because of",
          "Nothing interesting, just tower, if you have just 1-2 days in GZ, don't waste your time on it. There is more interesting things to see.",
          "Great view of the city. Modernism and a beautiful display of colours. It seems China lighten up for your eyes only, walk around the tower to view the amazing city lights. 150 RMD to go to the fist of three stops 433m. The higher you go, the higher the price 398 RMD will take you",
          "Evening time remarkable But please go with someone's I simply feels good by watching sweet couples Because I was alone I found mostly Chinese people very loving cooperative but mostly women's",
          "If you love the city and the lights, this is a MUST place to visit in Guangzhou at night. Take the ferry ride which can take you to different ports. The ferry serves as their river bus, like the \"Hop on Hop Off\" boats in Venice. Bring your jacket since it does get a little",
          "You have to see it. By night is more impresive. \ud83d\udd1d\ud83d\udd1d\ud83d\udd1d\ud83d\udd1d\ud83d\udd1d\ud83d\udd1d\ud83d\udd1d. Walking down the street and look at tower from diferent angles was so cool.",
          "Go to the Canton Tower at night and you can see the colorful light show that it has. The ticket to go up the tower can be expensive but it is worth it because of the view from the top.",
          "A 433 meter tower that offers an awesome view of Guangzhou and is a must see for anyone visiting the city. The light show offered by the tower is a great show as well.",
          "An amazing view. To visit for sun set or at night to enjoy the city skyline. Yet a bit expensive, it is the best point of view on Zhujiang new Town at night.",
          "Suggestion - Visit it twice - once during the day. Another at nite when lights are on. Accessible via Metro. Elevator to Observation Deck - Student discount available.",
          "Nice view from the bubble car and from the top, especially at night. Enjoyed the short visit but very crowed, long queue to get out.",
          "Being the iconic landmark of Guangzhou, we knew that we had to visit. The metro station canton tower lies directly beneath the tower and you can't miss it when you come up. There a plaza outside with lots of people taking pictures and vendors selling souvenirs. We decided to buy",
          "Iconic tower built for the 2010 Asian Games. Well worth the money and sometime queues to get up and see the best views in town... love the way it lights up in different colours in the evening...",
          "Decided against going up the tower. Lots of people around the vicinity taking pictures and there is a multitude of ticket types to choose from. River cruises are available too. There is a nice tram ride that costs only 2 yuan to take from canton tower to wan sheng Wei. I took",
          "Canton tower is nice to look at near or far but is very expensive to go up.But if you decide to go up you can buy tickets for a scare from thingy and a ride around the perimeter of the top.To get there take the metro to Canton tower station,then there should be a map that will",
          "The tower has some rides on the terrace which you can enjoy if you want to go out in the evening. Nothing spectacular.. the ride gives a panoramic view of the city.",
          "I am not quite fond of climbing up towers to view the city unless there is something else i can do. I do not know the city cery much, therefore a local guide we had was wonderful and kept testing me which side of the pearl river is the north side. He pointed out to me the",
          "The Canton Tower looks better in the night. If you take the night cruise, the colourful surrounding is good for photo taking. Going up to the Tower in the day is less interesting.",
          "Beauty amazing place in Chines it's more good place for food what you want like halal food and some thing more what you see",
          "I have been to some of the tall towers - Burj Khalifa/Dubai , Petronas/KL and Sears tower/Chicago and IMHO such towers are good if you are actually looking at them and not in them! So I decided to take a walk around the area around dusk over a weekend. Place is crowded with",
          "We were taken by our hosts during a free afternoon, Canton Tower is one of the largest buildings in Guanghzhou, its well worth a visit of you have the chance to go!",
          "If you have time this is one of the must do attractions in Guangzhou. A great piece of modern architecture. Very impressive view from the top. The walk on the glass floor photo area takes a little use to but it's worth plucking up the courage to do so. Amazing high speed",
          "Canton tower gives you a different look at Guangzhou. I felt it to be a little expensive however a must. The bubble tram on the top of the tower is well worth it. Just be sure to make sure that the weather is clear that day otherwise you won't be seeing much. The drop at the",
          "You have to go up to the tower at sunset to really appreciate the vastness of the New Urban China. You can combine the trip to the visit to the Guangdong Museum nearby. The sky bubble ride is unforgettable. We (64-year-olds) skipped the sky jump which the younger folks seemed",
          "I went here with my guide, the tower is good looking and very high,very beautiful but price is expensive",
          "Went while on a business trip with colleagues from work. Had a great time viewing the city, taking the ride on top and walking out on a glass viewing area (although apparently I am scared of heights and that was challenging).",
          "its a must see if you are in guangzhou. i spent so much time on the observation floor i just did not want to come down its look so beautiful",
          "I've never seen anything so large up close! We went during the afternoon. The views were very nice. We had hoped to go outside, but didn't like the extra cost and didn't feel it would be worth it. I am glad I paid the 150 RMB to go up to see the views. Perhaps I'll be back to",
          "Here, you can see the stunning night scene of new Guangzhou, nice landscaping, great tall buildings with wonderful lighting design at night. You will love it.",
          "Canton Tower is the highest TV tower in China & third in the world. Too bad entrance fees are rather high. I still prefer to view it from afar in it's full glory than 1st person view inside out. Believe me take an APM train & exit at Women & Children's hospital station. Look at",
          "My niece and I and her two young sons took the 1 and a half hour (6:30pm) night cruise down the Pearl River before heading to the airport for our 12:30am flight home. I highly recommend getting out on the water to see the beautiful Canton Tower and to experience a different",
          "With the expensive price to entrance the tower, its worth it enough. You can see the whole city from this tower and the cruise trip really amazing. I recommend to go here if you have enough money, but if not, just go to another places that cost less :p",
          "I've been to Guangzhou a whole bunch of times, I've gone passed the Canton Tower numerous times, and marvelled at the lights at night when driving by, but I've never been up, until now. We had booked with a local travel agency in Guangzhou, for slightly cheaper than you would",
          "visited it in 3 ways, and u must do so too to enjoy it, morning time, went up to the last floor and dared to take pictures in the glass small outdoor section thanks to the chinese photographer who insisted to help and took my hands to go there until i felt relaxed, the people",
          "We were in town for a meeting and our hosts took us to Canton Tower for an outing. We had a very nice meal in the Colour Canton Restaurant followed by a walk up several flights of stairs to the 107th floor. The view is fascinating, especially at night and there are some",
          "Great view. well organised. we took tickets for about 5pm in November, this allowed for us to be day and night time views. Make sure the day is not cloudy or too overcast or you will not see the city in its finest glory. the whole experience is very well organised and it gave me",

          "The summary of it: 1) It\u2019s fun! No better and easier way to experience the ultramodern side of Guangzhou. 2) It\u2019s very easy to reach by public transport. But if you\u2019re taking Metro Line 3, be ready for face-to-face crowd situations. 3) There are different levels. The more you",
          "Very nice place to visit..\ud83d\udd92\ud83d\udd92\ud83d\udd92 Would recommend to take a package with the bubble tram. Magnificent view. Different expriences and different breathtaking views from the bubble tram\ud83d\ude0d It's really worth it.",
          "We went there with lights festival. It\u2019s very beautiful from far away. We didn\u2019t go close, neither we went up the tower. We took some spectacular pictures though.",
          "Make sure you buy the Bubble Tram pass. We visited this attraction early in the evening, so we saw somewhat in the daylight, somewhat at night. Amazing!The fact that this place is part of many wedding ceremonies tells you a lot. Been there twice- highly recommended.",
          "Amazing place to visit, the people are kind and help full although they don't speak English they still try and help, the area where the tower is always packed with people especially at night were a light and water display with music is done. Brilliant place to visit.",
          "Taking the taxi from our hotel , a Marriot in Yuexiu park (12kms),we arrived at the foot of the tower around 20:45 pm with colorful lightings of the tower. Suggested point for best pictures of the tower is on the bridge. At the ticket booth , there are options of entrance fee,",
          "Highly recommended to come around 5pm to 6pm so that you can catch the sunset and wait for the tower being lit up. It\u2019s nice to see the city\u2019s transition from day to night. There are many admission packages depending on your need. Highly recommend to go for the one with the 450m",
          "Took my husband to Guangzhou for his birthday and we visited Canton Tower. It's very impressive from down below, but going up and experiencing it from the top, including the bubble tram was a unique experience. Weather was just nice, around 15 degrees. Loved it and highly",
          "The tower is very modern as it was built less ten 10 years ago. If you want to get to the high level, beyond 108 floors, you need to wait until after 3 p.m. the best is to visit it during a sunny day so that you can see the whole GZ. You also have to visit it in the evening as",
          "Best visited at night due to the lights. This is a busy place frequent by the youth. It is situated in the Tianhe district...",
          "It's always good to see a city from high up to get a different perspective. The Canton Tower is good to give an idea of the size of the city and location of various landmarks. There is a glass walkway that you can have your photo taken on if you so wish. Higher up it gets a",
          "If you are looking for lots of dining options, here is a good place to visit. There are several businesses within the Tower, including a Wax Muesum (meh,at best. Save your money) and a couple of gift shops. If you are looking for some really beautiful, and surprisingly",
          "I've never been inside this tower, but the building itself is very impressive and photogenic. Worth a visit while in Guangzhou",
          "The light show is on now. Beautiful lights n sight n it's a wonderful walk to the river. Walk along the river is refreshing.",
          "It is situated in the Tianhe area where one finds also the Guangzhou Opera and the Guangzhou Library both \"strange\" buildings. The Canton Tower is supposed to have a woman's form.",
          "Visited the light festival in November 2017. Very busy. HUGE crowds of locals with everyone taking photos. Brilliant atmosphere. They add to the feel by playing music in the background. So vivid and electrifying. Would highly recommend seeing.",
          "A finely lit tower that was a pleasure to be behold. More of a pleasure than I frankly expected. Worth your time to come out and see, while enjoying the city skyline near by. If you visit Guangzhou, check it out.",
          "The Canton tower is a spectacle from the outside and we were waiting expectantly to get inside and catch the view from the top. Unfortunately the wait was simply too long. Hours of queues and multiple times. Honestly the views in themselves were underwhelming. We just wanted",
          "We took basic package of trip to viewing platform at night. Other packages including rides for those with more time , or more adventurous! Worth doing, great view of city lights.",

          "There are similar towers in other cities but the closest in resemblance could be the one in Tokyo. It is normally very pretty and colourful at night, but I was especially fortunate when I happened to be there on the first Saturday of November when the Canton light show took",
          "Top of Canton Tower had a great view of Guangzhou. However the price of the ticket was pretty expensive (almost $30). It's worth going up once, but there won't be a repeat trip. There isn't any other attractions in the vicinity as well.",
          "Very nice from cruise view and inside too. The top of the tower is also good, but the top floor view is blocked by the tram. Lifts are very small and takes a long time to take up.",
          "Very nice structure. Specially the ambience nearby was very good. Walk along the river was great. There are many things you can do here. You can take a lift to explore the tower from inside by paying some yuans. You can spend atleast 3 to 4 hours here. If you want to click",
          "The view over the city is what stands out most when visiting the top of the tower, however, if you have the opportunity to enjoy a good meal in the 360\u00ba restaurant, you should not miss it!",
          "Rides at the top of 400 ft is really amazing. View from the sky deck and its amenities are also good.",
          "But the crowds are astonishing. I spent an evening here, and it was quite crowded with mostly Chinese young people coming to have a nice evening out. I went by metro and the station was packed tight. Reason? Everyone likes good stuff. The grounds are extended and there is a",
          "We had this on our list of things to do! Didn't go at night but probably for the best. No lines and easy to check out the view. Probably better on a clear day. We enjoyed it but I never need to go again.",

          "The Canton Tower is easily to access by Metro line 3, the location is in the center of Guangzhou, avoid rush hour if you go by Taxi, I rather recommend to get there by Metro line 3 and the station also named Canton Tower.. It was nicely designed and built, however I visited the",

          "The Canton Tower is a must do if you are seeking for great view of the city and also for some adrenaline rush .The first nice thing is the elevator that is made of glass and it gives you a scary sensation in the way up.Also you have to take the Bubble Tram .",
          "Visited the tower thrice to accompany visiting family.. Reach the place around 5pm.. roam around a bit and take the bubble tram after sunset to get the best of both views.. A bit expensive but worth a visit if you are in Guangzhou. It is connected by metro. Taxis might be",
          "Visited during canton fair It was good Time pass Need to visit atleast one time Loved it Will recommend others to visit",
          "this tower is very impressive also you will enjoy the view from the top. I entered the 3rd category ticket which allow you to the top roof but without riding the rotating balloon. but in general very nice I've enjoyed the time and the glass room. although the glass rooms",
          "View on the top: I should say it is really amazing. You cannot imagine how magnificent it is the town view transfer from historical part in the north to the modern area in the south. Especially the Pearl River embeds in the view like a shining silver belt. I strongly recommends",
          "Although Guangzhou is a massive city, if you're anywhere near the river, you will almost certainly be able to view the Canton Tower. It's a really remarkable structure and at night, looks amazing when it's lit.",
          "On a fine day, it is the highest point of having a panoramic view of the city. Though the entrance charges are on the higher end, the visit is still worth to experience.",
          "We did not go up in the tower, but it was very cool to walk around at night. The area is great for exploring, as well.",
          "I chose the 150yuan low level platform views. I was planning to get there at dusk and I considered there was only moderate smog. By the time I queued, purchased the ticket, queued, and got into the elevator it was past dusk. Oh well! And the queues were not too long either.",
          "It's beautiful landmark in Guangzhou city. Best time to see the tower is at night time when it's illuminated.",
          "We were there last Sunday night. It was amazing. You are so high, you can't see the details of the city. I am little bit afraid of the hight, but each one has to go to that tower. I am still impressed of the building and architecture. How is it possible to build a tower that",
          "The colours change all the time and it is a really impressive sight from either side of the Pearl River. The views from the top must be awesome but because of windy conditions we were not allowed up",
          "This is a must-visit site as it is the highlights of Guangzhou. However, it is relatively expensive to travel up. You may wish to consider having a meal there which includes the tickets for travelling up. Come at night as the skyline and skyscrapers looks better at night with",
          "Must-visit in Guangzhou! It looks amazing from outside, but if you go up it's even better! Take a 30m freefall at the top for more adrenaline ;-)",
          "Traveling down the Pearl Rmany miles awayiver, the Canton Tower dominates the skyline even amongst the skyscrapers all around. At night the tower lights up with dazzling colors that can be seen from many miles away. There are both Chinese and then English letters near the top",
          "This is definitely a must-do in Guangzhou! The tower is beautiful to look at from the outside, both in the day and in the night. We went only to the lowest level observatory deck on the 107th and 108th floor, but it offered a beautiful view nonetheless. The ticket office",
          "On a clear day, it is a good place to have a view of the impressive business district of GuangZhou. While I did not go at night, I think it might be even better, as the Central Business District illuminations are quite nice from ground level. If you bring your own water,",
          "is a must experience you can pay from 150 rmb up to 400 rmb just to go to the top of CT. The ticket office close at 10pm. by night is a good show. Keep in mind that subway stop service after 10pm and some minutes.",
          "The bubble ride at the top of the tower is petrifying. Don't do it! Seems extremely unsafe and rusty. We were so scared and uncomfortable the entire ride. It felt like a nightmare.",
          "Well just like anything else. One has to experience the canton tower for themselves. From the river, one gets a really great view too. The majestic tower as well as colourful high rise buildings in the new city centre.",
          "You don't visit Guangzhou if you don't visit the Canton Tower. Great view at night since we took the cruise on the Pearl Delta. The tower was mesmerizing when it changes it's lighting. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "It's a must see as pretty much every tourist will go to see the Canton for the night view. There's a great atmosphere across the Pearl River in Huacheng guangchang. The view across Guangzhou is nice but maybe not worth the money to go up to the top, unless you are a fan of",
          "We went on cruise and from there we saw Canton tower. We got to see both light and night view. It looked beautiful. Very good tourist attraction",
          "If you visiting Guangzhou, spend some time to visit this iconic tower. It more beautiful if you come at night to take a picture. During our visit, we did not enter the tower, however it worth to visit surrounding park. A lot of tourist come here even at night time too.",
          "Tall building with some restaurant in it s low level . Due to different Light color on it during night in my opinion it is more beautiful At night .we did not try to go to it s above.",
          "Having lived in Guangzhou for 2 years I've been to the Canton Tower exactly once. It has a good view of Guangzhou and worth going up if you are visiting the city. However you will experience long lines to get into the elevators and long lines for the elevators to different",
          "It is the symbol of Guangzhou. During the night time, you can enjoy the changing colours of the lights of the tower. There are a few restaurants that you can eat and enjoy the view of the Pearl River and Guangzhou. They are a bit expensive, though. You can go up to tower to",
          "Amazing. Must do.. Especially at night.. Try to chose a clearnight which are very few & far between due to air pollution... But generally a night with a good breeze & not cloudy is best.",
          "I had visited the tower last year, it was so amazing and impressive place which it can make you exited.",
          "We went there on October the 1st which is a national holiday, it was full beyond reason, but it's a beautiful and most see site, taking the bubble tram is well worth it, you can see the entire city from that point, afterwards when you come down there are lots of restaurants and",
          "A must to visit attraction in Guangzhou. Needs at least 6 hours to go up to last floor, enjoy bubble train at 114th floor. Avoid visiting of a foggy day that spoils the trip.",
          "We enjoy it,there is plenty to do there from shopping to restaurants and of course the top view is amazing.",
          "It was a nice experience, quite far from the touristic area but it worths the night visit, a symbol of a growing China reachable via underground or faster via taxi.",
          "Just like everywhere else in China, there are hoards of people even if you get there well ahead of time. The prices are ridiculously expensive. Its better to go on Shanghai tower, don't bother with this one.",
          "Incredibly well laid out and operated! Management deserves Kudo's for finding lots of points of engagement! Great views! The drop ride is exhilarating and the cars that circle the top are really good. Definitely worth a visit!",
          "It has colourful lights that can be seen from the city area of Guangzhou. Taking the lift to the top was very fast, and you can feel your ears popping like when taking an air plane that is taking off. There is a level that provided 360-degree view of the area, but due to the",
          "If you want to go, go just before darkness & night when its lit up. Getting there is rather simple. Find a metro line within Guangzhou and take it to Chigang Pagoda stop on line 3. I( or the tram ) f you don't want to pay money to go to the top of the tower, you can satisfy",
          "Beautiful tower with nice architecture detailing. However, the facade elements are blocking the view and difficult to get nice panoramic picture of the outside view. We went only to the observation area level and were not too excited. Quite lucky coz not so many people so no",
          "It's a huge and beautiful tower, near the metro station with the same name. There are several types of tickets. The cheapest one is 150 rmb and you can get to the closed desk at the 430 meters. Honestly, it's not very interesting because you barely can see any view because of",
          "Crowded with local people nice place to visit. I didnt go in the tower because of short of time But did go for pearls river cruise nice experience. Lot of food option near canton tower. The ticket is according to the floor you want on the cruise but let me tell you take",
          "Very nice place to walk in the evening, nice place to take photos. You get to see the tallest building in Guangzhou. There are restaurants around and coffee places as well.",
          "we cruising at nite.. Nice tower with wonderfull colour can see clearly at nite. But not really satisfy the river.. So many rubbish from the river. But i like the foods so many stalls and all kinds of foods.. Been here 4 years ago.Over land trip.. Starting trip from Guangzou.",
          "CANNOT MISS THE SKY DROP, highest sky drop, breathe taking, great ambiance, though you need pay a bit extra to go to the top but it's totally worth it , there is also a bubble tramp.",
          "Be prepared for long lines to get up and for the best photo op spot! I did the 2 observation decks, which were plenty. They also sell tickets that include the little ball tram (you sit in a little glass ball and rotate around). Now I realize this might not be such a bad gimmick",
          "Entrance fees are expensive unless purchase a combo tickets. Long queue to go up to the tower. Packed with local tourists and have to bear with them cutting queue. Nothing much to see and will rather just take up the cruise tour.",
          "The tower is overlooking Guangzhou from the highest point in town but there is no real interresting view. The restaurants on the top are very basic in their choices Just a fine spend time if you have nothing to do on a day, but wouldn't make it the goal of the day",
          "Too many people on a Sunday evening. Too many lines to stand in to get to the 108th floor. We had to join another line to go further up and God knows how many lines were there. So we stayed in the stuffy and crowded 108th floor for a few minutes and left. Over US$100 wasted.",
          "Probably it was because I went here in June that's why It's raining all the time. It's wet yet so hot! Humid city and hot. Something you should know: 1. Taxi got bars separating the passengers to the driver. It's like you're riding to jail. 2. Food are basically Cantonese",
          "It is a sight to behold especially if you come nearer to the tower. The lines to go up the tower could be very long. I don't know why they don't allow people to approach the base of the tower. Even if you decide not to go up the tower, it is still a good place to take",
          "Its easily accessible from the metro (Canton Tower Station) or the tram, and looks amazing during the night with the changing colours of the lights which illuminate it. If visiting during the day, as with any observation deck up high a clear sky will grant you good views but a",
          "Nothing much to do if you are not planning to go on upper floors and rides. Was there last month (July, 2017) on Saturday, the place was super packed. No matter where you look you will see a crowd and people sitting on the pavements, grass etc. We didnt even bother going inside,",
          "The tower is centrally located and, should you choose to go to one of the upper levels, offers a nice view of the city. That having been said, tickets are expensive for what amounts to a long elevator ride and 'add ons' (such as photographs) are overpriced. In this way, it's a",
          "We visited on a beautiful, hot, sunny Tuesday afternoon in July and I was worried that we should have reserved tickets. This worry was unfounded as we had purchased our tickets, and were on our way up the tower within 20 minutes of arriving. There are 4 digital ticket kiosks",
          "Its beautiful tower in the night time and many color. Also nearest bridge over there to looked the beauty of Guangzshou are of China. But in the noon time is very hot to traveler and many traffic jams.",
          "Was captivating by the nite View of canton Tower. Took a cruise that sail thru the Harbour passing bridge and beautiful high rise building. Day view was also beautiful, There's many restaurant n shopping mall to walk around.",
          "Nice place to get a look to the city from above. Good time to visit is after sunset and most the sky be clear not foggy.",
          "Was a cloudy rainy day so could not go all the way to the top was really looking for that However the view from 107~111 floor was also excellent very well made structure , visiting upclose really puts things into perspective of how large it is",
          "There is one place you should to visit in Guangzhou \" Canton tower \", just beautiful, stunning, and amazing .",
          "It's an okay experience from the top but yeah the ferry ride to the canton tower is much better than the tower experience. Though the color changing feel of the tower is beautiful from close.",
          "If u love heights, you'd love to go on 108 F to take a pic there or even at the 450m high bubble tram. There's a glass box ( on 108F with glass bridge effect. Lets you see how far below the ground is. ) Although the tickets are skyscrapingly costly it's also a perfect place for",
          "If you've seen the city from the mountains then I'd skip this. This place was littered with people. Just not worth it in my opinion.",
          "when it's not raining, just go for a walk, beautiful lighting and all, many people running in the moonlight, nice",
          "The bubble tram on the top is very unique and you can see 360degree of the view for the whole city! I strongly recommend to go there at night! It's so fabulous!",
          "Try and pick a clear day and you will be rewarded with amazing views. Pay the extra and go on the bubble tram or 'the drop' if you dare. Post a postcard from the highest post office in the world. A popular venue for wedding photographs, some beautiful brides were up there too",
          "Great place to visit in Kanton. When weather is good the view is really great. You can see whole magnificence of Kanton city. Just check if there are no repair services going on the roof floors so you can get outside too.",
          "My stay in guangzhou was very short. I had to visit many places in guangzhou. I visited canton tower too. I reached there via metro line 3. You must visit canton tower if you ever go to guangzhou.",
          "This is very creative and technical engineering work of Guangzhou engineers Very colourful and medical decorations will be visible from most of the locations around lake while your traveling on bridges Visit with children will be best sightseeing",
          "This tower looks amazing from outside and the view is even better up there. Prices are fair and it is definitely worth it :) You can choose from a number of options. Me and my friends decided to try a bubble tram which is pretty slow what gives you the opportunity to enjoy the",
          "It is the highest building in Guangzhou. The view on the top is fantastic. I would suggest to go there at night. The lights are beautiful. The bubble tram on the top is very unique. The bubble cart takes people going around the tower on the top floor so you can see the 360",
          "Amazing experience with great views ! a lot to do in and around the tower. Also recommended to do the activities that they offer.",
          "It is an iconic landmark in Guangzhou. There are various activities on the top of the tower. It is a famous destination to see Guangzhou's night view. It is recommended to go during late evening when it is lighted up and becomes attractive. Despite enjoying Guangzhou's night",
          "The view from Canton tower is unfortunately blocked due to pollution. Best to go early as the pollution gets worse as the day progresses. Otherwise is OK",
          "Ideal to go when the weather is clear though the views are still breaktaking if a bit cloudy. Would recommend going in the afternoon or evening, giving time for morning fog to clear. Though there are quite a few permutations (e.g., skydrop) for visitors. the basic (observatory",
          "Al and I went up the tower, as he had never been there before. Good thing to do at least once in your life.",
          "Good view. Just go up there and eat so you don't need to pay for entry. Walk along the river across the bridge for better view. Come to the other side to see Opera house and museum. Good walk.",
          "Go up, take a picture, look totally confused, come down, is basically the procedure here. The view was cool. The miniature model obviously took quite a few hits from reckless rude hands, but obviously left out the torn-up old houses that outnumbered the skyscrapers messily",
          "This is a must visit when you are in Guangzhou, the views around this tower is awesome at night time. We been here twice already, the first time we went directly to the canton tower but we couldnt go up the tower because it was so foggy that night, wasn't worth it. Make sure you",
          "A must visit for a great shot of the massive tower in beautiful changing lighting. I didn't go up the tower though, because its quite expensive. You can have pictures of the Guangzhou CBD of highrises also, across the river from the Canton Tower. A visit on the evening is",
          "Great landmark night and day. Illumination is spectacular also with clouds in the morning after a nightly thunderstorm.",
          "This is a pretty amazing structure to behold from the ground, particularly after dark as it is lit up in ever-changing colours and once you reach the top, the views are incredible. Riding in the 'bubble tram' around the edge, 400 metres up is also great fun, and makes for some",
          "The tower is beautiful and scary! Too bad the weather prevented the rides but the observation deck was worth the trip!",
          "Great venue 1) The top tower is the best. They got world record of highest sky drops rides here!!! 2) Night view at top is magnificent 3) Ground floor sometime got performance and shows 4)Must visit to show you have been in Guangzhou"

It's best to visit off peak when there isn't a lot of people so you can get enough time to visit the animals without feeling rushed. Walking distance from the Hanxi Changlong metro station.",

          "This place is massive, we spent 4 hours walking through many of the exhibits and still did not see everything. The kids liked the dinosaur trail ( very cool as an adult as well.) And the train ride around the open safari portion is a really neat way to see all kinds of animals up close.",
          "Actually a really cool zoo with a great aerial tram with nice habitats with lots of room for the animals.  The animals seemed active and visible.  So many zoos have animals that seem lethargic and depressed but here the monkeys were swinging and the elephants splashing in the water.  They have a bunch of pandas too.",

          "Had zero expectations going into it but came away very very impressed. The biggest thing is the sheer number of animals they have. Most zoo\u2019s will have 2-3 of each type but there were literally tens of each type. The other thing is the safari - you can drive in yourself ( or",
          "I've been to a lot of zoos and by far this is the best. What separates this zoo from the rest is how unbelievably close you can be with the animals. The animals in the zoo are very diverse and plenty as well, and the crowd could have been much worse on a Saturday. The highlight",

          "we had a lot of problems getting to the zoo and we needed bus to get to the hotel which was a squash and the chimps enclosure was small and they could escape and attack the visitors and its cruel to put animals in small places and its also cruel to make animals perform in",

          "Take that shuttle service whenever you can. Otherwise, it would have been a lot of walking for us on a sunny, hot, humid August day. There are many types of free range animals here. Likely many animals are happier than those at the zoo. The panda area has the most sightseers.",

          "August is summer. the place is easy to find. Theres a few places like Theme park,waterpark and Zoo. I only go to Zoo and Theme Park. The Zoo is ok but the Way inside quite confusing mostly its oneway path. So once u take that path no wayback. The food there is quite expensive.",
          "Beautiful place, well kept, interesting and fun safari, mainly for kids. Was great driving our car inside and also important to choose the right time to avoid too many people. Unfortunately, no good food to be found inside so, better eat and go on a full stomach.",

          "It\u2019s a great place for spending your time make sure to have enough time to visit every where. If you want to walk keep enough water and food with you specially if you are vegetarian. At weekends there are lots of locals everywhere shouting and this makes animals uncomfortable.",
          "I love this place, we did everything while staying here, we had safaris, ate in the restaurant with tigers sitting behind glass right next to us. Flamingos wandering around the park, monkeys, birds everywhere, it was just magical. The theme park is there too. When you enter for",

          "We took a tram ride around the park and saw numerous animals. The best part of our visit was the panda exhibit. We saw at least 10 pandas including two juveniles. Especially liked that their enclosures appeared spacious. We also went on the aerial tram for a nice view of the",

          "After visiting for the entire day and seeing most of the park, here\u2019s a few pros and cons I noticed from the visit Pros 1)The place is relatively clean (including toilets) and well maintained and have many well placed amenities 2) Lots of white tigers, koala bears, pandas,",
          "it was rainy day when we visited the park, but still enjoined a lot , i suggest to go in there......",
          "Just the net place to my office...The best place for the kids and the family...A lot of Hotels cheap and expensive...A lot of enjoyment...few days worth trip...A must go to visit...",
          "The relationship between tourism and foreign tourist is challenged not only by cultural procedures but also by the lacking of language training. Checking in or purchasing lunch or breafast tickets can be very challenging with the lacking of customer service English speakers .",
          "We went to Chimelong Safari Park with our 5 year old and two year old sons. They had a lot of fun seeing the animals up close riding the truck train. Make sure to sit on right side as most of the animals were on that side. They enjoyed the tram across the safari park. Lots of",
          "On a warm day it really was a unique experience , you can drive in with your own ride as well as on a safari coach,lots of interesting animals in a well organized habitat",

          "The first tip to offer you is to look for a combo ticket wherever possible. The parks have an annual card that costs in the range of 600 RMB, which would pay for itself if you went to the Chimelong complex three times over the course of one year. But if you cannot justify that",
          "Great experience! Safari on weels is must try! Friendly english speaking stuff. Restaurants and toilets all around. We were at CNY, so there was crowd, but worth visiting.",
          "I\u2019ve been here a few times and I absolutely love it! There\u2019s so much to see and everything is very well organized! I highly recommend taking the safari and feeding the giraffes and elephants!",

          "the park is great. nice and 5 stars graded zoo. we went during cny which is china's biggest holiday. the crowd was massive and we can't really view the animals well. we were fine with it till the white tiger's closure. the crowd pushes so much that 1 kid almost fell inside the",
          "The place was better than I expected before my visit. The animals seemed healthy and the environment was well-maintained. The white tigers and pandas were, in my opinion, the star attractions. Worth a visit if you\u2019re in Guangzhou and like animals.",
          "Only visit if you have children and go on a weekday. We went today it was extremely crowded and unpleasant. We bought tickets online they were $70AUD each plus we spent another $20AUD each on a small meal and drink, massive rip off! Cable car ride costs another 150RMB so we",
          "So big. We came at the opening hour and went straight to the train. Our guide told us that we HAD to do it. The line took one hour to get through and with exception to the white tigers and llamas, mostly the same animals as in any zoo. Definitely do everything else and bring",

          "We took the train and saw safari animals in the open. We just wish we could have drove our own car so we can stop and take pictures. They allow private vehicles to enter and take the same road with the train. The train uses gasoline so the smell is nauseating. However, the",
          "We arrived there at 1pm and it was not so crowded, liked very much with both little shuttle train and the cabin in the sky. Panda were cute, most animal looked peaceful, unlike some of the zoo in Thailand or China, you can tell if they are enjoying the environment. It was worth",

          "This park's divided in 2 areas: zoo as we know it and safari. In the zoo we saw sleeping koalas, joyful flamingos, smiling elephants, curious giraffes and national love of Chinese people - pandas. The only panda triplets (Mengmeng, Shuaishuai and Kuku) live here. Special",
          "Its a very biggg park. The animal collection is pretty complete, they have pandas and lots of tigers, there\u2019s also this jurassic park filled with look alive dinosaur robot, the entry price is pretty expensive and the food too, but its worth to visit dont forget to try the sky",
          "We completely love Chimelong park Guangzhou. This was our third visit and probably the best. The main reason was lack of people. Fortunately we have chosen the right time (weekdays before Christmas). The new cable car, safari train, private cars or just walking around will give",
          "Once you accept you are visiting a zoo and will be seeing animals in a captive environment then as an experience Chimelong was very good. Not being a fan of zoos in general and having been a to some horrible ones Chimelong was very good. The enclosures were of a reasonable",
          "We visited the Chimelong Safari Park for a whole day and the experience was awesome. The best animal park I have ever visited. My favorites were the pandas and the white tigers. I really recommend to take the swan lake cable car and then the train to see the big animals roaming",
          "Our main purpose for visiting was to see and admire the giant pandas. We all loved watching them sit, eat and walk around their enclosures. Our first day we went in the afternoon which was a little busy, while the next morning we arrived early and there were few visitors in the",
          "Its very large safari park. Very nice to walk with very wide path. Every pavilion larfe enough to accommodate the visitors. The inside transportation is many choices such as mini train to explore African animal or just cable cars to get the top view",
          "this is a must do when you visit Guangzhou,very interesting and cable car is excellent,worthwhile to go",
          "I love how the animals are treated well. I also like that the place has a lot of sitting areas. The cable car and train ride is the most convenient way to tour the park.",
          "Large park with 2 separate sections, walking section and drive-in section. Even when you don't have a car, you must take the 'Safari-on-wheels' ride to access the drive in section of the park. The ride is located at the North entrance and it is free. Two cable car lines",
          "We took a taxi there from our hotel. Not knowing what to expect. After the trip we give it a thumbs up. Worth the time and money spent. The Safari is a huge place. We first rode on a tram for nearly an hour. Saw lots of animals roaming around freely. Special enclosures for white",
          "The park is huge and houses a wide array of animals in well-kept enclosures. When visiting, I would highly recommend taking the train ride which gives you a comprehensive view of most of the animals. Do take the glass-bottom cable car ride as well to view animals from a height.",
          "Really great day out. But be prepared to spend tons of money. Going on a weekend, tickets cost 350rmb, otherwise it\u2019s 300. It has a great selection of animals and they are kept in well sized habitats. The design of the park isn\u2019t so clear however and the food is very expensive",
          "Outstanding experience where we saw animals roaming freely from the comfort of a tram or the vintage point from a cable car (both included in the tickets). Walking through the numerous enclosures brought us to many other fascinating animals. It is quite big and will take you a",
          "if you like pandas then you will love this place. lots of cool animals to see and do not miss the swimming monkeys. coolest thing you will ever see. great zoo. a must see",
          "Huge park, plenty of animals, many shows. + nice place for kids, as there is no age limit to enjoy rides and shows - few places to eat, always pretty crowded, if visiting by car or train be prepared to have other visitors stopping between you and the animal you are trying to",
          "This is by far the best safari park I have ever visited!! Well kept open enclosures, rare animals, free tram ride , cable car ride ...it has everything and more!! Highly recommend spending a whole day here",
          "lots of animals in this park. usually you would expect just 3 or 4 of each type of animals in each enclosure. this park has at least 10 pandas including the famous triplets panda. and at least 20 white tigers in different parts of the zoo. the best part has to be \u201csafari on",
          "It's not just a Zoo, they do their best all the time to make sure everyone is happy. Train, cable car, Jurassic park and dancing shows and a lot more.",
          "The best zoo, I've ever visited. Animals are so fluffy, so beautiful, so clean!!! I have no words to describe my feelings. Must visit!!! You will start from monkeys, pandas and koalas, later use trap cabins to have a look from birds sight and use a train to be as much closer as",
          "The pandas, the dinosaurs and various animals are waiting for you. A whole day is needed to experience all the amusement locations in the park. This park enjoys a nickname of Guangzhou Disney World of Animal Kingdom. Bring your children to here, they will definitely love it.",
          "Must visit place. Huge zoo. Plenty of animals. Worth your time and visit. Pandas are very cute. You can also feed the giraffes and the elephants.",
          "It's a wonderful place it's good to visit. I LOVE ALL THE WILD ANIMALS AND THE SCENERY.The cable car is worth to ride to see the animals on the field the zebra,girrafe and many more.I love the white tiger,panda triplets and the Elephant and the Koala as well.",
          "almost compares to Disney World\u2019s Animal Kingdom, but for a much better price. You will be worn out before you see everything, if it is even possible to see everything there in one day.",
          "We visited Chimelong safari during our Guangzhou trip and were not disappointed. There are 4 highlights...safari on wheels, 4D animation panda story, Panda triplets and cable car. The safari on wheels is the best where you get to sit on an open toy train type vehicle and can",
          "This is the best zoo I have ever visited in China. In the safari on wheels you can drive a personal car through different animal habitats. There is a great cable car ride. The park is famous for white tigers and the world's only panda triplets. There is even a very touching 4D",
          "Very nice wonderful park, huge open spaces,beware of biting invest take lots of repellent, animals roam around freely, no bars allowed, you have cable car, Sarah buses, trams,if u have little ones take the safari buses, u have to pay extra ,but the distance and heat is often to",
          "Pandas, tigers, elephants, giraffes and koalas to name but a few. Definitely worth a visit! It was highly educational and informative.",
          "One of the greatest Safari Parks / Zoos we have visited. Pandas! Say no more... not often you can see them in their natural environment",
          "Fantastic park with many pandas (including triplets, a world exclusive), many white and golden tigers and plenty other unusual animals. You can table a cable car to go over the whole park and also a small train (or your own car if you have one) for a safari to see zebras,",
          "quite a surprise that such an old zoo park has been well organised and maintained. Yes, lots of ppl during public holidays but a large park to wander around, no need to worry about crowds. Lots to see and to buy, though food and suvenirs are all quite expensive. WCs are easy",
          "It was a very good and makes me so attractive to the place which I really likes very much I was so happy",
          "This place is enormous and I loved that it came with a free cable car ride to see the animals from above! Unfortunately we arrived at 3 and were shoo\u2019d out before 6 so we did not have enough time. Why do they close so early? They should be open till 7 at least. You really need 5",
          "We walked around for 30mins then took the tram and cable car(because we gave up walking halfway!lol!). They have interesting attractions within the park itself. You will need to spend at least half a day here.",
          "When I went here, everything was okay. There was even a tram ride with the animals running free, which was a great plus point. What went bad was that the tram ran over a deer, and back over it again. Ran over the same deer 3 times. Still cannot remove the image and sound of a",
          "a lot of animals but the weatehr was humaid. Also no halal food in the place and no english signs or even staff who can speak english",
          "I was there to visit panda house but sadly it was sleeping For kids and not young ppl above 15 years",
          "This safari park i would definitely recommend others to visit. It is well maintained and the Animals are truly taken care of. There is food court and drinking water facility at walk able distance. Kids will enjoy this place and everyone can have a great time",
          "This is a huge park where animals are cared for amazingly well and are not stuck behind glass. They are expansive spaces to live and roam in. Feeding the animals was amazing for our girls and a join to watch the interaction. No food can be taken into the park and we didn't",
          "Expensive entry ticket 350 rmb per person which is contained with a few types of animal. Just panda is the most interesting.",
          "Visited this safari park with friends, thinking that it might just be another typical zoo. But i was really impressed by it. This park is really big and clean. You can easily spend the whole day there, so be there early! Anyway, be aware that the Chimelong (\u957f\u9686 - pronounced as",
          "First let me give a summary review before getting to some specific points. The zoo is beautiful, well organized, and seems to treat the animals well. The park is very oriented toward children, but is very crowded. Some specific observations and pointers: 1) I went on a weekday",
          "Clean and very organized. Loved walking around. Food is all Chinese style and most Americans would not enjoy.",
          "Although some of this is more safari park, there is still a lot of typical zoo here. If you are looking for the animals in a more natural setting you can do better elsewhere, but the park does have a nice gondola system. Due to weather damage, two main corridors were blocked off",
          "Take a tram or cable car. View the Safari from the air over in a cable car. Follow by tram to have a close up with the animals. Overall, an interesting concept and kids will enjoy the experience.",
          "The park was huge and you can easily spend a whole day there. The park is filled with people that wanted to take the cable car first. There's special queue for hotel guests. We are not and properly have to wait for an hour. We decided to skip that first as we didn't want to",
          "So the park is pretty expensive, and at first we wondered whether we had made the right decision. However, we were so impressed by the whole thing. You can easily spend a whole day here. The animals seemed happy and most had loads of space (especially compared to zoos, which we",
          "The most exciting place to view animals, no bars alllowed, a lot of giant glass windows but outdoors for most animals the distances are far so if you\u2019ve little ones and its hot there have strollers fior hire and trees a open mini bus that takes you to certain enclosures once",
          "Visited with my 2 kids age 5 & 10 year old , place is good and very near to chimelong hotel . Extra discount to hotel residents, for 2 adult 2 kids below 1.5 mtr s cost is RMB 850 , kids below 1mtr is free . No vegetarian food available at this place . Make sure you have to walk",
          "Pandas, more pandas. I would call it a panda themed zoo ;) very well sectioned and upkeep was high rated. Love the safari on wheels and cable car rides. A large park, do expect some walking for more coverage. Make good use of the cable car as you catch an eagle eyeview while",
          "Park is nice and clean. It was little rainyday so there was no crowded and that was good! We took gondola over park, where you can see different animals. That was nice. But best thing was to see giant panda. They were cute, but cannot have thought: hoppfully they have been taken",
          "The Chimelong Safari Park is a great place to spend your Sunday with the family. Quality of the attractions are great. You can see Giraffes, white Tigers, Panda Bears, Peacocks and a ton of other amazing animals. The area is vast, you can take a cable car to get around. Only",
          "We checked the timing at internet It said the closing time was 9 But we reached at 7 and everything was closed Google must update the timing But place looked huge and beautiful A good option for tourists",
          "First of all, they provide free bus shuttle from metro to the zoos and hotels. We went there on a weekday and it was off peak season. To us, it was crowded but to the Chinese, it wasn't. However, the queues move quite quickly. Although I read on the website that they close at",
          "I do realize that it's not listed as a zoo anywhere or do they even pretend to be a zoo, but you expect certain things with parks with animals. Overall, the experience is not worth the amount of time and annoyance to actually get to the place. It's way out in the middle of",
          "Had an amazing time at this park. Fun safari type ride. Kids got to ride and feed elephants, pet Koalas. Saw great shows. Would go back in a heart beat.",
          "This is not worth visiting, If you are planning to travel all the way from Hongkong. This will require a separate visa so it not worth",
          "I visited this zoo with my family and my kids love it so much. It tooks us almost whole day to enjoy the scenery and the animals. I would advise to take the cable car to have the whole view of the park before you decide where to have your thorough site visit.",
          "There were way too many animals in the safari. The safari ride was also unusually good. There were plenty of 4 d shows and other attractions too. I loved the pandas",
          "Be prepared to spend time here and enjoy the animals and parks. Lots of different animals to see and activities for kids. Staff are well trained and depending on season, this place is well known for the crowd. For us, it was perfect timing and weather.",
          "I like the train that take us to see many animal. The park is well organized. The toilet in the park is clean.",
          "The zoo is quite big and has feeding areas. Pretty large park and lots to see...one needs a whole day to have fun with your kids at this beautiful park..",
          "Someone writes that it\u2019s a waste of time; I\u2019m really chocked!!!! It\u2019s absolutely not ! It\u2019s an excellent park but you need at least 6 hours, I spent half an hour enjoying pandas joking together It was a wonderful time",
          "It's not worth a visit. You can utilize that time to visit pearl riverside or even different parks. .",
          "The chimelong safari park is really amazing.... we had a great time there.. has a 5D movie...had cable cars... its worth a visit...",
          "Anywhere that has Pandas on show is a must-see for me and this property didn't disappoint. Spent most of the day here and took the Gondola ride over the park which was great. Food in the various restaurants didn't cater for anyone who isn't Chinese and the staff don't speak much",
          "The park has an awesome layout. It has five different parts with heaps of animals! Don\u2019t worry about getting tired while walking around this huge park, because you can always catch a ride on one of the many electric cars that drive around the park. We definitely recommend",
          "I would not go so far as to say that it\u2019s poor, but I did not enjoy it much. Kids in particular will gain something from seeing animals from all over Africa and Asia. That said, it is a real tourist trap. A dozen gift shops all sell the same schlock, such as pin-on tiger tails",
          "This is a lovely park to spend the day with family and friends. We went during the Lunar New Year and whilst the park was great our experience was not that great due to the long queues, lack of queue discipline, lack of English speaking staff etc. Nevertheless, we still managed",
          "I was worried about visiting this park, knowing the reputation of Chinese zoos on animal welfare. I found it hard to find reviews that were realistic/impartial about this issue. So here is a review for you if you are also keen to see the good treatment of animals! We visited",
          "This place is amazing. You can see white tigers ( baby tigers too) koala bears, panda bears. You can see everything from the air or go to train safari, between the giraffe.",
          "Had a perfect day in there. For the hole day I forgot I was in China. The place is 100% clean, welcoming. Staff will help you always, you have panda triplets, baby lions and kangaroos and much more... what else do you need?! And price is ok for everything they offer.",
          "Worth visiting park, with big area. A lot of different animals from all over the world. Amazing panda area.",
          "It's a nice park, with a lot of different kind of animals. You really can walk here for a full day! There is a lot of entertainment for the kids, the shows are nice! certainly will go again!",
          "I did not imagine myself getting so tired this much in my life. Going around the park is exciting but so exhausting at the same time. Overall, the safari is great. Kids will surely enjoy the place.",
          "The Jurassic park style tram ride was fantastic. LOTs of exotic animals like lions, giraffes, cheetahs kangaroos, like over a dozen white tigers, tons of birds, monkeys, everything - plus two cable car tracks that circle the zoo and the ponds inside. I live in Chicago and we",
          "yes, be this. every one like to watch them and the place so peace and warm. if u hope come here ,u can tell me.may be i can help u.",
          "We were in China with our large family and did an all day excursion to the safari park and the best we have ever been to. You can ride the safari on wheel part and see probably 1/3 of the park. The animals were well taken care of. Th koala and panda parks are awesome. They",
          "This place was phenomenal! The animals were healthy and given ample room to play. I only visited for a few hours towards the end of the day but it is a very big safari park, and you can spend a full day visiting it. Worth a visit.",
          "I'm always reluctant to visit zoos or in this case a safari park as i feel that it will be a letdown (from previous experiences). Well, Chimelong Safari Park was rare because i totally enjoyed the visit. The experience on wheels and also on the cable car was awesome (all",
          "we enjoyed the Pandas, birds, giraffes, gondolas, train. so much to do at chimelong safari park, you can easily spend a full day",
          "This was the most amazing zoo/safari park I have ever been to and eclipses all the great US parks including San Diego and St. Louis zoos. Absolutely amazing. The park is very clean, abundant food available although the big restaurant in the middle of the park is not English",
          "I could have stayed all day and then some! The Safari was exceptionally clean and the exhibits were wonderful! The tram and the gondola rides are included in the ticket price and give you a wonderful overview of the park, especially the gondola. It was from here that we",
          "Got my tickets from Klook with 10% promotion, weekday ticket is cheaper and lesser crowd. Tickets at the park cost 250rmb/person and if you bring your own car into the safari that's an additional 250rmb. I understand running a safari can be expensive but i find the entrance fee",
          "Take the ride portion of the zoo first to get an incredible view of the various animals. There is little separating you from the animals and there are a huge number of animals in each section. This zoo is worth the hype!",
          "Be prepared for a lot of walking. Food pricey. Should provide free shutters for those who need to turn back. Free bus shutters but very pack and not enough instruction.",
          "Chimelong Safari Park is the best zoo/safari place that we have been so far, and we have been to plenty! Regular adult fare is 250 RMB while a child's fare is 175 RMB. But for some reason, we got a special fee of 500 RMB for 3 people (regardless of adult or child). Take note",
          "Went to the Safari Park and had a good time. This place was recommended so we decided to go. Once we were told we could see pandas, my interest was definitely peaked. There are a lot of animals at this park and one should start off with the train ride. We then saw the koalas",
          "This was a great zoo where the animals seems to be treated as well as they can in a zoo. The highlight of the park for our kids was the dinosaurie park which was really cool also for us adults. A nice way to spend the day and also to get close to the animals.",
          "This is not only a safari park but also an animal sanctuary with a mission to preserve threatened species. We had the opportunity to see feline cubs and recent mothers in the delicate situation of only a couple of weeks after birth. The animals are active, well cared for and",
          "Simply amazed I have been to several Sue's but I've never been to a safari park I was amazed at every turn",
          "its quite expensive when i converted the amount to indian rupees . its quite big and also has a panda house",
          "Nice safari park where visitors could get quite close to wild animals. The park was also very spacious with nice layouts. Plenty of clean toilets around was a bonus especially for tourists. I loved the Chimelong Safari Park and our trip to China. This place was FANTASTIC!",
          "For someone who's visited practically every zoo and safari in the UK, and knowing the standards at places like Beijing Zoo and Badaling Safari (both of which are terrible, regardless if you care about animals or not,) I wasn't expecting much which is why initially we only went",
          "We are \"kiwis\" from New Zealand - one of the reasons we came to Guangzhou was the chance to see Pandas -they are so cute ! We stayed at Shifu Holiday Inn, the taxi to Chimelong was 27km and took almost 1 hour - cost was 85 CNY which for 4 people is only approx NZ$5.00 each.",
          "It doesn\u2019t look like a normal zoo, it\u2019s bigger and it seems that animals there are kept in good conditions. It is close to Hanxi Chanlong metro station, just 10 minutes walk or free shuttle bus, entrance fee is 250rmb, it includes a cable car and 4D theatre. You can easily spend",
          "Safari and circus performance were both amazing. We were both extremely impressed. Would definitely come back from the states and visit with kids! Must go to.",
          "Before you decide to visits the place, be prepare to check the travel option. If you are traveling by taxi, it can be very expensive and time consuming. The best is to taxi the metro. Cant really remember the name of the station where you can take a shuttle bus to the park.",
          "A great place to be for different age group. The safari park is a good eye opener with many exhibits. Clean and huge park that can take you one whole day to visit. There are safari cars to take you if you do not want to walk too much. An activity which is suitable for all",
          "Caught the subway early and glad we did, as needed whole day here. Most interactive zoo we have been to, really enjoyed the variety of monkeys freely swinging above us (watched by keepers). Loved seeing school groups visiting also, they were very friendly and wanted to",
          "What a fabulous park! Very green and treed. We took the cable car across the park and had a Birdseye view of the exhibits, up close and personal to the Pandas. The tiger breeding programme is very interesting and it was wonderful to see so many tigers of different ages. You can",
          "not expected so close to the big city of guangzhou, half hour dirve from the city centre you easy find this park, which is part of a zoo, a crocodile farm and this safari park, where you take your own car or hop on a tourtrawler. a bit expensive, higher prices than in europe or",
          "Awesome zoo - beautiful landscaped grounds and enclosures . The highlights were the great chairlift - watch out for pandas! Also there is an endangered tiger breeding program here - so many gorgeous cubs of all sizes, and adults. A real joy!",
          "This place is awesome. Every animal I can think of and so many baby tigers and lions! Of course it\u2019s still caged animals which sometimes isn\u2019t pleasant to see but they appear to be very well cared for and there are so many. We did the safari ride and it\u2019s pretty good but go when",
          "We enjoyed a great day at the Safari park. Took a metro from the airport to the stop where we got off at Exit E and took a bus to the park. It is very BIG with a lot of trees and shade, which is great so you don't get sun-burned. The safari itself was about 40 minutes in a",
          "I would really say comparable to animal kingdom in Disneyworld. The place is HUGE almost twice the size of animal kingdom. It has everything from kangaroos to koalas and bears and pandas. It even has cable cars that takes you around the whole park. Definitely worth a visit when",
          "Visited the place twice during our stay in Guangzhou. Unfortunately, both times were during summer, making it really tiring. Animal enclosures are maintained quite well and if you plan right, you can catch a few shows as well. My daughter enjoyed it a lot.",
          "This is basically a Zou, but it focuses on safari and jungle animals. The Jurassic Trail can be frightening to young kids, but is still cool. It features anamatronic dinosaurs. The highlight of our visit was Panda Home Base where you get a great view of the Panda Bears. This is",
          "Took a taxi from my hotel and unfortunately he brought me to Chimelong Paradise Park which is an amusement park for children cost of $250 rmb. After I entered the park and realized it's not where I wanted to be I walked a short distance to the Safari Park. Not many people",
          "Chimelong zoo was a great experience. They have every animal you can think of and you easily spend a whole day there. Most of the animals have great space and are fine being held in capture, but the bears didn't seem to be fine. Especially one bear would wander back and forth in",
          "The park is huge, looks like a forest. The temperature inside the park is at least a couple of degrees cooler than outside, so it feels very pleasant (we were there late October) The animals look well taken care of and are quite active. We went right when the park opens (at 9:30",
          "Big open aired nature park, some sections were closed of for some reason. Pandas were the big highlight of the trip! Definitely worth the effort.",
          "It's a huge park with all kind of animals. Just try it out by urself it rly worth it to go there. It feels like walking in the jungle",
          "I spent a whole day there, the quality of the facilities is surprising clean and the animals seem very well treated. And cherry on the cake, I got to see pandas!",
          "The Safari Park experience is something to do if you go to Guangzhou. The price is really reasonable for a gigantic place like this(300rmb) and during holiday season. You get in a train and go all around the zoo or at least a part of it. The only thing that surprised me and",
          "Is not a zoo, neither only a safari or a park, I would say is a combination of all of them into one single place I would say is like a disney type park with animal themes that includes a safari ride Definitely a must, kids will have lots of fun, specially with the pandas and",
          "I had high expectations before visiting Chimelong Safari Park, and I wasn't disappointed. There's lots of animals to see in this huge safari park, where one can easily spend 6 hours. And the adorable panda triplets, is a must see, if you visit the park. I was there in",
          "A very focus and dedicated zoo with lots of rare white tigers, bears and impressive Panda family. The panda triples are extremely adorable and close range within 3m without glass wall. Animals looks healthy, chubby and not stressed. However, looks like the same set of animal",
          "This is a huge, diverse, and most enjoyable amusement \"Park\"!! Most/many of the animals walk freely about this 300+ acre park- which is the largest in China!!. The Panda's alone are worth the \"price of admission\"!! The other parts of this wonderful complex can be seen",
          "We spent over 6 hours in this park, and still did not see everything, and only watched 1 show. I wish we could have seen more and enjoyed more of the animal shows. We started our tour of the park by doing the safari on wheels, we road in the train tram. I found this part of",
          "Very big zoo! Grab the map at the entrance or you will find difficulty navigating around. Tickets can be bought on klook.com or simply go there to buy. I went on a Friday and it wasnt crowded. They have animal showcases on and off. Take the cable ride and the tram ride.",

          "This place was great! I got to see all the animals and they have them very active when people are around so you don't miss them. The safari part is also amazing and last but not least THE PANDAS! \ud83d\udc3c Overall 10/10",
          "The safari at Chimelong Guangzhou is much better than any of the other zoos I have visited here. The animals do seem to be very well looked after, and much healthier than I had expected. There are some really interesting exhibits, and, thankfully, most of the information has",
          "Visited during summer,so clear skies and sunshine all around the vast amount of Animals was astonishing , unsurprisingly the que for the pandas were huge but the bus service in-site is excellent and a must",
          "All the animals were sleeping ... there are many animals but they're all so lazy I wanted to see an energetic panda but yeah haha that didn't happen! It's a good place anyways!",
          "I visited Chinelong Safari Park with my parents during a 4 day stopover in Guangzhou. We found the zoo to be truly magnificent, full of wonderful encounters. We arrived prior to opening time and were their for 5 hours and still didn't see everything but had to leave because of",
          "This is the most unique zoo experience I have had. The cages are made of glass partitions and seem very scary. However, I am sure that they have done all tests to ensure safety.",
          "It wasn't by choice that we visited, I am sure that given choice, the animals would rather be back home. the locals seem intent on prodding, poking and otherwise annoying these often wretched creatures. The other parks on the site are well worth the visit.",
          "Our kids had lots of fun here. The safari offers trolley rides through various parts of the Zoo and also provides cable car rides for visitors to view animals from the top. Everything is great except for the price. It cost RMB300 per adult and RMB210 for kids above 1.1m. I",

          "A big zoo! Nice safari park where visitors could get quite close to wild animals. Even better if we were to rent a car and do a self-drive inside the safari section. With that perhaps we could spend more time and had more stops with nice pictures. The park was also very",

          "Huge safari park. I did not imagine myself getting so tired this much in my life. Going around the park is exciting but so exhausting at the same time. Visit the place during cold weather. I also wonder why panda's, kaola's and tigers are all asleep during day time. U cant enjoy",
          "this was really disappointing in that half the animals were \"On Holiday\" yes thats what the staff told me once I had paid and started to walk around. No Pandas, No lions, No Tigers. All the said enclosures were being re-built which is a good thing but at least let people know",
          "We have been to Chimelong Resort Safari Park many times as a Guangzhou citizens. The park has an awesome layout. It has five different parts with heaps of animals! That means no matter where you go, you will have lots of fun. Don\u2019t worry about getting tired while walking around",
          "The zoo is quite big and has feeding areas so start early because kids love to stop at every feeding area. We could barely finish a part of the zoo. Safari was very ok.",
          "So we were expecting more from this zoo, being we had to pay $37 us per adult, but we're disappointed as many exhibits were closed or only had certain hours of operation. If you visit, enter thru north entrance and take the safari train, as for our family, it was the highlight.",
          "Tthis is one the best Safari parks i have visited in my life.There were way too many animals in the safari..The safari ride was also unusually good. There were plenty of 4 d shows and other attractions too.I loved the pandas . saw them in abundance..pretty large park and lots to",

          "I have never been to a zoo that allows you to be so close to wildlife without having you feel like you were attending a circus. This place gives you the experience that you are part of their natural habitat experience. Not animals performing tricks at a circus. There are many",
          "Loved this place!! Just caught a taxi from our hotel - didn't cost much. So much to see and had the best day! Not many (if any) food options for Western food but that didn't spoil our day. Will definitely come back here again. Make sure you see the spider monkeys! Just a tip in",

          "I've been here a few times, and I've loved it every time. There are so many animals to see, and they are given a lot of space to roam around, unlike many zoos I have seen. Getting close to the elephants and giraffes was my favourite part. The safari is also really good! We loved",
          "First of all, avoid going to this place during summer time, as it is very very hot. Nearly all attractions or animals are outside. The only place to cool down is where you can find the pandas. Lots of different animals to see and finding an animal you like is not difficult.",
          "I went with a friend to visit the safari park. Around 5 hours is enough time to see the whole place. For the money it was fair. I have seen bigger parks, but also smaller parks.",
          "Amazing safari park with lots of animals and lots of open space for the animals to roam about! A very family friendly park with lots to do!! A great day out discovering safari animals and more! Would definitely recommend!",
          "I absolutely loved this place. Loved the pandas and the white tigers. It's great what they do to engage the people by engaging the animals every half hour or so. This was the highlight. Of course it's a captivity but the efforts to make it \"natural\" was alright. I was traveling",
          "We enjoyed visiting this zoo for the day and had a terrific time visiting all the animals including the panda triplets and the white tiger. All the trees and plants around the park reminded us of a Jungle or rain forest. The hippo show and elephant show were very fun! Make sure",
          "I recommend do the drive through and walk through. It was fantastic. Bring a pram for little ones and lots of water and comfortable shoes. Beautiful grounds- I can't reveal to much - just go there and see for yourself!!.",
          "This is by far one of the best parks I have been to and can compete e.g. with the Singapore Night Zoo. The best part of it, is the Safari part where wild game roams around relatively freely. You can take a walking tour through that part, or sit in the mini-train and ride around",
          "This place is amazing! This place is the best wildlife park that I have ever visited...and I've been to the top ones in the US and a few abroad. They have everything, Panda's of course, but also white rhinos, koalas, hippos, pygmy hippos, chimps, etc.... Make sure to take the",
          "I went on a weekday and the number of people I saw there was a tell-tale sign of how good this safari park was going to be. There are two parts of the Safari Park - Safari on Feet and Safari on Wheels, whichever you want to do first. We chose to do Safari on Feet first. There",
          "Great zoo! make sure that in addition to the zoo, you check out the circus! the \"safari\" is a bit lame, but the rest is nice.",
          "I went to Chimelong Safari Park on a Monday, and the crowd was small. A friend and I purchased a day ticket - you'd definitely need an entire day to complete the park, no less! The atmosphere at the park was truly amazing - you feel like you're in a forest. (Visit the dinosaur",
          "I have been here 3 times and each time still love to go to thte Safari Park. It is amazing with the train go throungh the park and you can see many many animals just like been to Africa (although I never been to Africa). My kid is excited with the trip. And the Circus, you",
          "The best thing about park is that animals are really close to you. There is no cages. And you even can feed some of them. We also visited the show with the elephants. It is really funny and enjoyable! Even though it was raining we had a great time.",
          "Its ultimate.... Nothing like this... They way they have created tropical forest and the variety of animals that are there. Very nicely taken care of eacha nd every detail. You can get very close to animals they play near your feet. Truly Amazing Experience. Kids very very",
          "This zoo is an animal photographers paradise. I was surprised the animals were so active - but there is a big focus her on viewer satisfaction, so the animals are frequently engaged by the keepers, who, for example throw the bears food treats to get them to jump in the water.",
          "Took our kids here and we spent a whole day in the park. They loved it. The park is very big, and there's a lot of animals to see. From the world's only panda triplets to countless white tigers, to thousands of flamingo. Elephants, lion, giraffe, rhino, chimpanzee, zebra,",
          "Come here with my dad, when we have a free time. Its been a long time for my dad to go to place like this so i think will be fun for him. We wasting our time there by walking sighseeing eating some food and chat. Nice day but a bit humid that day. Lot of kids come with their",

          "It is a safari where the animals are trainned as in a circus. Different then animal kingdom. You can see a great viriety of animals trainned even birds. Go to the final attraction.",
          "Just holding a map, tidy paths with clear signs, selling gift shop, stores, very convenient. All ages are appropriate. This zoo lot of tourists, so it is best to avoid holiday. First, we take sightseeing bus to see the outdoor animals, staff will introduce some of the animals",
          "It's amazing, there are a lot of animals, you can walk by foot, can take an e-car, there's a safari on a train, we spend there around 5 hours",
          "Not only the park, you can also enjoy the hotel and Space Circus. Wish to watch the Bengal Tigers while you have your breakfast and so on ? Just try !",
          "I spend a whole day exploring this safari park and still have places I can not visit. highly recommended but i think the price is a little expensive.",
          "Excellent place for a day outing. Plan to reach early as it is a huge park and will need a complete day. Excellent place for person of all age.",
          "I arrived rather late in the morning and you really need to start early as it is a big park and there is a lot to see. I went on a Monday and it wasn't thronging with people which was good. For the most part, and for a Chinese zoo, it's pretty good. I visited Guangzhou Zoo a",
          "Huge park with lots of animals. I guess the animals that attracted me were cola bears and pandas! Is indeed a great time to spend time with your loved ones in such a wonderful safari parks. Safari rides offered you a closer view to animals!",
          "This safari park is huge and packed with interesting animals including pandas (6 of them!), rhinos, hippos, giraffes, bears, lions etc etc etc. The animals seem to be very well kept and good discipline seems to be maintained regarding feeding of animals by visitors etc. My",
          "This place is massive and has alot on offer, many animals to see and learn about, many shows to watch and animal interactions. There is even a safari ride to get you closer to the animals. Was great to see all the animals looked happy and comfortable with plenty of room.",
          "Much better the. The local zoo. DO NOT GO THERE Great way to spend a day. Go early and go to the north entrance. Take the safari first as it is better in the morning. The Dino area was really cool too The park, while relatively new is very cool. We skipped the shows as it",
          "It was easy to reach there by metro,and then u have to take bus inside the park and get off in Safari park station. the park has 2 parts one is the part that u should go on foot and the other part is Safari on wheels. the only thing that bothers us was food! there isn't any",
          "We had a great time here with our 2 and 5 year old daughters. Lots to see, and you can get up close to lots of the animals. We fed tigers and giraffes, my daughter held a parrot, and we were able to see a tiger cub up close. The safari itself was not so interesting if you",
          "Great zoo, sizable and with a wide variety of animals. The safari on wheel can give you the illusion your are not in China! Must try! Great for kids to discovery all type of animals. Food outlets are quite low quality, so keep your expectation low.",
          "This has to be the best safari park in Asia. Very diverse range of animals and the drive through section gets you close to all kinds of wildlife like zebra, giraffe.",
          "This place is huge. Did I mention the place is huge? Nope it's really big. If you're bringing a toddler don't forget your stroller. If you're travelling with seniors expect to slow down. I've never been to a place with a bigger assembly of animals than Chimelong Safari Park.",
          "After going though the amazing reviews on TripAdvisor we decided to visit the Chimelong Safari Park and were certainly not disappointed. Each ticket cost was about 250 RMB (zoo+safari). Though a little expensive it was worth the money. The zoo is well maintained and the animals",
          "Best safari in Asia for sure. Animals look like they're well taken care of. Don't miss the train. Traveled with a five and a two year old and they both enjoyed",
          "I just returned from China and had the pleasure of taking a day trip to Chimelong Safari Park while in Guangzhou over a weekend. Chimelong Safari Park is part of the larger Chimelong Tourist Park which include a theme park, hotel, and water park as well as the zoo. The park is",
          "The amount of animals in this park is crazy! In Las Vegas one of the biggest attractions is the White Tigers show, this park has about 50!! and Pandas are everywhere! a must visit when in town!",
          "This Park is excellent relatively speaking. The animals are all free roaming and have wonderful habitat areas. The animals looked very happy and comfortable. A public train takes you through the \"jungle\" area driving past a huge variety of animals. At the end of the Park you",
          "Great day out if you can handle animals in captivity - the safari train through the less concreted section was a highlight. The panda triplets are the draw card and that area gets busy, but lots of other highlights. Not sure I could ever tire of watching the monkeys and their",
          "Our daughter loves animals, during our trip to china i really wanted her to experience this. It was a rainy day .. which from what we heard is why many Chinese werent there.. Best day to go. NO ques and took as little or as much time as we needed",
          "One of the best shows can someone be witness of. Highly entertaining, adrenaline rush keeps you at your chair edge, biting nails and enjoying at its must.... It's a semi outside event, crowded at times of the year, so better avoid it on Summer time. Best period to visit is Fall",
          "Safari park found to be clean and well maintained. Exciting especially the Safari on wheels. Animals were found to be well taken cared of. Likewise animal nursery was found to be interesting and very educational.",
          "No fences in sight, open enclosures with all the animals you want to see. Tigers, Lions, Pandas, Giraffes, Kangaroo's. Koalas, Rhino's, etc etc. The enclosures are natural, the animals have plenty of room to roam around and the place (including the enclosures) is clean and well",

          "I'm Singaporean and the Singapore Zoo has been known to be one of the world's best for having 100% cage-free environments for the animals. When we came to Chimelong Safari, we felt like we were in the Singapore Zoo, yet bigger with more species to look forward to. The animals",
          "We visited here in March 2013, during Spring. For the first half of our time at the Safari park we were trying to shelter out of drenching rain, and ducking from one exhibit to the next within short breaks in the clouds. Nevertheless we managed to see most if not all the",
          "Best safari Park in Asia. Super organized! Good variety of animals. Lots of fun for children. Great service at every corner!",
          "A day is not enough to go around the Park. I was amazed to see Pandas of very close range. They are amazing animals. I spent the whole day there but I couldn't visit all sections.",
          "Best zoo, that I ever visit. Big territory, a lot of animals, different kind of attractions. But never go during weekends, too much people.",
          "I'm not particularly into zoos, but this place is unbelievable. It's huge, with an incredible array of animals, many of which you can get up close to and still feel safe. The animals appear to be happy and well-fed, not sad and bored. You can feed the elephants and giraffes,",
          "The best Safari park in China. Lots to see, plenty of animals and a safe feeling sitting in the trailer. It gets smelly at times, but the animals won't mind you.",

          "This is a big zoo, but the 'safari' part of the name is pretty deceptive - it's a little train that drives around a relatively small enclosure at quite a distance from the animals, only giving you a glimpse of them. However the rest of the zoo allows you to get much closer. The",
          "This is a must go place. However, please avoid going there during Chinese holidays (to avoid the crowd and better to go during winter (to avoid the smell).",

          "Was extremely impressed with Chimelong Safari Park, especially after having experienced the Guangzhou Zoo. The animals appear healthy, happy, and humanely cared for. There are different interactive areas where you can feed the elephants or giraffes. Recommended!",
          "I am quite surprised to find that this park was huge. We boarded the tram car in the morning and was amazed to find so many herds of different animals. Afternoon, we went to see the highlights of the park which was the White Tigers, Pandas, Koalas and the Elephant Show.",
          "This safari park was the most impressive zoo I've been to in Asia. The animals were all in great condition their habitats were well maintained and the staff were constantly giving snacks to the animals so they weren't sleeping all the time. There were many opportunities to",
          "It's an awesome experience, we booked a private car to drive us around for 2 hours. The car brought us closer to the roaming animals. My son enjoyed feeding the giraffes. It is highly recommended.",
          "It's the biggest zoo in Asia. My kids enjoyed very much. We walked more than 6 hours unstoppable and never get tired. It kept many rare animals here. Like, White Tigers, Panda, Koala, Malayan Tapir & etc",

          "We stayed at the Chime Long Hotel and it is quite amazing. Probably the nicest hotel I have stayed at. The rooms are nice, simply but nice. Excellent large deep bath tub and comfortable beds. The hotel is nice and food is very nice as you eat beside some white tigers, yes just",
          "Plan the whole day to visit this park. I am used to a zoo where there are 2-3 of most large animals, be prepared for small herds of elephants, giraffes etc. Not only is there an amazing assortment of animals there is also really great animatronics particularly impressive are",
          "We were quite surprised to find such a nice safari park not so far from the city of Guangzhou. They have some exotic animals, like the bactrian camel, with two humps and they have done a good job of creating a faux natural environment. These little kids love interacting and",
          "Chimelong safari look after their animals well. I was very happy with the spaces designated for the different animal enclosures especially seeing the elephants had such a large space to wander around in. It even has a section you can drive through or catch a train/car through",
          "Loved the place. Animals look very well taken care of. A bit pricy but definitely a great option for a fun family outing. Avoid weekends",
          "This is one of the best Zoo I have ever been to. It like a big petting zoo for large animals. Super clean and fun! Highly recommend.",
          "There are two parts of this attraction - one is the zoo and the other is the safari park (in train). In the zoo you can see all kinds of amimals and birds - flamingos, chimpanzees, 5 types of tigers living naturally in the open, tiger cubs, etc. The safari park is \"A MUST DO\".",
          "We travelled to the park as a family during summer school holidays, probably not the best time to go because of the crowds, but my recommendation, \"Go Early\" and \"Eat Early\". We organised our tickets before hand, that way we didn't have to line up with the thousands, of whom a",
          "Very well planned especially compared to some of the other zoos I have visited across China. If you have the energy, you'll find it'll probably take you a good 4-5 hours to go through the whole thing. Broad range of animals, highlights were definitely the white tigers (60+).",
          "A few things I would have liked to have known; 1) They DO accept visa at the gate - probably one of the only places in the city that does. 2) The section where the pandas are (north of the Meerkats), does not open until 11.30am...we got there at 10am so we had to wait. 3)",
          "Chimelong Safari Park is large, we spent the entire day in there. We had a great time. Since it is so large, route planning is really necessary. Though the admission fee is expensive (1 Day pass - Adult RMB250, Child/Senior above 65 RMB175, child under 1m tall goes free) but",
          "This Zoo is very attractive. White Tiger , Panda and many kinds of animal are there. There is Safari Park area. You can take Bus to see several animals. It's really big zoo!",
          "Should full one day tour to cover all area. We have a wonderful and knowledge experience. Food can not enter the park but drink bottle was allowed. Many food hall inside, but quite expensive.",
          "I visited both Safari on wheels (drive through) and safari on foot during the summer. It is quite nice, comparable to the one in Bangkok. The safari on foot has a lot of fake animal along the way, not very impressive however it entertained kids. The best part is the real Pandas",
          "Covering more than 1 million square meters of land, Chimelong Safari Park was an amazing adventure for me and my family. My original plan was to purchase entry tickets to Chimelong Paradise, a theme park of some sort and the Chimelong Safari Park, not thinking much about the",

          "Unfortunately the people responsible for the care of the animals don't have the necessary knowledge to treat the animals right. Unfortunately this is not seen by the public, however it is clearly spread out in the news. I personally discourage people to visit this park, since",

          "It's a great place for anyone to visit. The pandas and the giraffes are too cute. Would probably come back here again coz i missed seeing the zebras. The location is convenient from Metro, but you may need to walk around 5-10 mins. It's worth the walk anyways. Just remember to",
          "Best amusement park i have ever know . Its water park is amazing . But do carry your food if u cant eat chinese food . Wild safari is also very good which u can do before going to water park . It will tak max two hrs .",

          "I was pleasantly surprised with this place, its perfect place to bring your family when you are in Guangzhou. The zoo was huge! And it was divided into a walking zoo and a safari park where you can drive your own car. All the animals looks healthy and happy. It was very hot and",
          "Went to Chimelong for the first time last month and it did not disappoint. It is a bit pricey for China but a similar day out in the West would cost about the same. Chimelong Safari Park is home to an array of the worlds most exotic animals. Flamingos,baboons,rhinos,koalas you",
          "This is an amazing experience. When I go back to China I will most certainly be doing the zoo again. Never got to do the safari would love to do that. It is a bit expensive but worth every bit of it.",

          "Appalled at the activities with performing animals - circuses where animals are abused to baying crowds - was so shocked at the live animals being fed to the predators for sport ?? Lions fighting each other for a live chicken on a pole - Is this educational or blood thirsty -",
          "Not a massive fan of zoo's in general. This is a pretty massive zoo! I felt so sorry for so many of the animals. All the children screaming, slamming on the glass, flash photography despite mange messages saying no flash photography, and no slamming the glass. There was minimal",
          "Chimelong zoo and Safari is beyond words. Not only is the place a haven to hundreds of different species of animals, it is also a great educational centre for young children and adults alike. You will not see a single cage here. The animals are housed in huge enclosures. They",
          "Nice place to spend the day with kids. Surprisingly big, with enough room for the animals, it's not like they are trap in a cage. Organisation is nice, but marketing is too much american style, pushing you every corner to buy something, even letting you go trough a shop to exit",
          "Our son really wanted to come here to see the white tigers. All of our expectations were surpassed though! This place is amazing! The drive through part was one great animal exhibit after another. Every kind of animal was out and easy to see, no disappointments. The biggest",
          "Great day out for all the family although total price was similar to day in any place of its type around the world. There were a lot of people but it never felt over crowded. All exhibits were very well signposted maps were provided in English I spent a few extra Rmb and bought",

          "The Chimelong Safari Park is well-organized, both the park and the staff. It is only a pity that the visitors are not very well-educated, love to jam in all queues, talking loudly like in a wet market! The drawback from the park is the toilets, quite smelly and dirty...all",
          "A big zoo with a lot of animal to see. Kids will like this.but make sure u come here early morning because too much thing that u can see.and dont forget to by the ticket pass for the circus also. It worth!!",
          "You can easily spend a full day here. We arrived mid afternoon which only allowed us time to do the safari and see a few highlights of the zoo (which is enormous). I enjoyed the circus very much. You don't see circuses like this in North America anymore. However, if you are",
          "We walked around and it was not hot as lots of trees in the park. The food is not that good though. We got to visit the triplet panda too. First time experience. pretty good.",
          "Just beautiful, amazing, quiet, in the middle of the nature. Pandas, white tigers and many more. It's a pity that we could not see the panda triplets. Good motivation to come back again.",
          "My advice : arrive to the park very early if you want to see all this place has to offer at a normal pace and do not leave the Safari on the wheels till the last moment.There are many remarkable features in this Safari park .The little cubs' area ,koalas ,Pandas off course and",
          "Adults a bit underwhelmed. Not the cheapest of family outings, but ticked all the boxes as far as our kids were concerned. Natural style habitats of decent size for a zoo. We were lucky to be allowed in with our own food, but beware bags were getting inspected and food not",
          "My husband and I went to see the Giant Panda;s in the park and were pleasantly surprised at what the rest of the zoo had to offer. While there have been some pretty negative reviews out there about the Safari park, we were surprised to find the animals well taken care of, having",
          "Let me ask, would it be more humane culling these elephants instead of living here in a free range park? Because there's an overpopulation of elephants in Zimbabwe and these are pretty much the only choices they have. Apparently to these 'activists', no zoos should exist in",
          "Brilliant. The Animals roaming free were a spectacle to see. Our group were transported around the park via a train. The Driver stopped at various vantage points for photographing. At the end you are privileged to walk through Jurassic Park/forest and finish in a huge cave with",
          "Excellent zoo, comparable to the international ones like Singapore and Japan. Very clean and animals are quite alert, lots of different varieties. Kids enjoy very much, it is quite a long walk tour so be prepared hours of walking under hot weather. They also treat animals",
          "We did the Safari Park drive through with our car. Were a little disappointed. For 330RMB per Person plus 330RMB for the car we thought we would see a little bit more. Because of all the cars there was traffic jam all the way. With two lanes, one lane is closer to the animals.",
          "I have been here a few time with my daughters and they always love it. If you have a car with the possibility to open the roof even better...because for the children is the best position to enjoy all the tour and see all the animals. Big place, clean and above all a lot of",

          "We went to chimelong for a family afternoon, we took the car safari (with our own, much better than with the train) and then visited the zoo. We have been quite impressed by the huge number of species and the space allocated to the animals. And it was clean, which must be noted",
          "Amazing. Must see. I have been to many zoos before - this is the best (by far). So many animals, they had sufficient space to roam around ( not always found) and all accessible for the whole family. Food stalls and paths all clear and big enough to cater for everyone..",
          "This is easily one of the best kept Zoos I've seen anywhere in the world. They have all sorts of animals and its a nice walk around as well. Though if you are expecting a safari, don't. its a normal zoo, don't let the name fool you. The panda's are the highlight of the place.",
          "I first visited this zoo a couple of years ago and found it deeply grim. But it's changed radically in terms of animal welfare, much, much better these days. The close access to the animals may be surprising to westerners but they appear to very well cared for. I don't really",
          "I went there to see the Panda but found out that it was a great zoo. It was bigger then I thought and there was lots to see. It was good to see the pandas been feed, as well as the baby triplets. The safari train trip was a real surprise as the animals can walk up to the train.",

          "Pretty good amusement park with some decent rides to go on. Had a bunch of fun when I went. Gets pretty crowded on the weekends and holidays, but when else do you go to an amusement park really? Anyways, definitely worth a visit, and shouldn't take more than 3 - 4 hours to see",
          "my advice is dont went to this place on weekends or holidays,too many people there and has to wait for a long time if you wanna play.",

          "After spending the previous day in the nearby Chimelong water park, which was pretty amazing actually, the day continued in the connected Paradise Park. As it was a week day it was pretty uncrowded and there was quite a lot of construction going on in certain parts of the park.",
          "Chimelong Paradise is one of the best Amusement / Theme Parks in China. By western standards, it's just OK, but you didn't fly all the way to China just for this park, right? Still, the park does offer some pleasant surprises, namely the two 3D immersive theaters, the Forest",
          "Taking the tots to the kiddy rides is a good way to pass a day in Guangzhou. To Americans you will find this like a Chinese version of a 6 Flags park. Lots of rides, junk food galore, characters, some shopping, a parade. If you like ride parks, this is one of the better ones",
          "It is one of China well known attraction. Located close to the zoo and the circus. So that a day trip for these attraction May be feasible. Cloudy day in summer or during the cold winter months make it desirable.",
          "We bought package from TaoBao for 3 days 2 nights hotel and park tickets. It's much cheaper. The park tickets can have multiple entries for 3 days to the Water Park. Water park opens till 21:30 and so we can go again after visiting the zoo and the theme park for two days. The",

          "Weather forecast for the day is: there will be thunderstorm, but we don't have other free time, so we went ahead. Hallelujah. It is a sunny day! There were no cues for all rides, the kids do enjoy the rides. For the adults, the big time rides are great: Dive Coaster, Ten",
          "Loved coming here and riding rollercoasters. The rollercoasters here are great and fun. We went on a random Tuesday and the lines were short, but lunchtime can be busy. Some of the local schools come during lunch break and the park gets filled up for a couple of hours.",
          "Had an amazing time with kids young and old. Never a dull moment at this zoo, feeding animals hand to mouth, taking photos with exotic birds of paradise, being licked by giraffes, seeing all the different African jungle animals, parade in and out together. Best monkey show",

          "We got there by train and it was quite easy to walk to the park. The most exciting ride was the Dive Coaster. May be because the others we wanted to go on were not working (motorbike coaster and 10 inversion roller coaster). That was quite disappointing as the charge to the",

          "This place is huge, lots of water slides, great wave pool, lots of fun in general. It can be really crowded, we like to go in the evening before closing on a weekday. Definitely worth it if you have age 7-14 kids",
          "We only had a couple of hours to spend at Chimelong Paradise, but luckily due to the lack of crowds we still managed to fit quite a few rides and attractions in. One of them that I most remember was the 4-D cinema experience, which was an Ice Age movie (short). We went in to",
          "Go with a group, I went with my class and it was so much fun. Our instructor had helped plan the trip and we ended up with cheaper tickets that way. It was a very fun day overall but beware of the water ride, make sure you buy one of the water/rain jackets because you will get",

          "I stayed at this hotel in January. The hotel is ok. The carpet in the rooms looked a liitle dirty and worn. The beds were a little hard. The white tiger buffet is hit or miss. Sometimes it is good but if the hotel is having a big conference ( Merck at the time) then the buffet",
          "This is a must go place. The roller coaster is v v v v exciting! However, please avoid going there during Chinese holidays (to avoid the crowd and better to go during winter (to avoid the smell).",

          "Coincidentally we stayed there at the Halloween night and the show was fantastic. The rest of the park is great, nice roller coasters and ghost houses. It's worth a visit!",
          "A super fun expierence. When we went at early morning the lines were small and no extra line skipping passes were required. When getting food, inside the food halls, give yourself at least half an hour to do so as lines in here took ages.",

          "Fantabulous place Rides for all kinds of ages But chimelong safari park and circus are more interesting",
          "Unlike other international theme parks, Chimelong Paradise is almost like a hidden gem. Located far out in the Panyu district, I would have missed this attraction, if not because my 11 year old son keeps bugging me to bring him there. But I was quite surprised when we arrived",

          "When we arrived at this amusement park, we could see so many people and we felt a bit regret buying the ticket already. We though how can we survive with so many people. It would be a very long queu and wasting time. But surprisingly inside was everything in order. The queue",
          "This place is outstanding! The zoo is world class and the parks are so much fun. Over concern for the treatment of animals, I was leery about visiting the circus. However, after seeing the zoo and how well cared for the animals were, I believe that their animals are treated",

          "easy to get to just by using the subway. this park exceeded my expectations. surroundings were very clean. the restrooms, too. the rides were world class and they were pretty safe. even their shows were amazing. must go on a weekday to avoid long lines at the rides. very limited",
          "The kids enjoyed the rides and we adults enjoyed some shows. Food is ok, lots of locals during the time we visited but weather is hot and humid. I suggest come during winter season, for a more pleasurable experience. The toilets could do a lot more improvement though.",
          "A fantastic theme park designed with various entertainment attractions. It is not possible to try out all fun rides in 1 visit. This is a very popular place for family outing and hang out with friends.",
          "Came here to get some excitement on the roller coasters that was offered in the park. Managed to get on them and the crowd was just crazy probably due to holidays I assume. Still, this place would be a good place to thrill seekers as well as families. I spent almost the whole",

          "If you go to theme parks for the rides, this is the place for you. They have every ride for riders of all appetites and ages and all were interesting and fun. The park was so huge that we didn't get to try all of the rides. Based on our experience it is worth a second visit,",
          "Chimelong park is one of the best in the world. Maybe, Singapore Zoo is more or less same. Huge area, a lot of animals, including baby animals, which is really fantastic to see. 5 hours minimum to visit the Park.",

          "There was nothing to dislike. Appropriate for all ages but the coasters are the best part. They are everything from fairly mild to OH MY GOSH! Chimelong once again did it right with this amusement park. Plan to spend the better part of the day and try to go midweek to avoid",
          "Chimelong Paradise has 7 rides that are claimed to be only for adults and extremely thrilling. I didn't feel thrilled as much as just having a good time. Some rides were painful too. Majority of theme park is a family destination. However, they have a show called the Countdown.",
          "Going around the park made me feel like it had some semblance of some disney some 6 flags some universal and a few others. Oh no, china at its best copying or patterning themselves to the west. But in fairness, the rides were great, without the the exorbitant prices we are now",
          "A few different type of roller coaster is the main attraction to this theme park, and all of them are fun!",
          "Well who doesn't like roller coaster rides! We stayed at Aoyan Golf, that is the best budget hotel if you want to stay nearby. Rides were fun, have visited other theme parks so it was not so good and not so bad. But still a whole day fun if you have a day at Guangzhau.",
          "Chimelong Paradise offered scary and thrilling roller coaster rides that kept me occupied for hours, but also other facilities inside such as various restaurants and cafes to insure visitors don\u2019t go hungry. Often the queuing for the rides was relatively small and virtually",
          "Awesome here, had to pay about 50\u00a5 for a taxi from the train Guangzhou train station cause it must be abit out of the way and then about 120\u00a5 for the entry, but well worth it. Some pretty awesome coasters and only had to que at the most 20min to get on. Food wasn't great but no",
          "With much scepticism I went to Chimelong Paradise. A Chinese friend said it was great, I did not hold my breath. Wow - clean, organised and some of the best rides I have ever encountered. EVER! You have to go if you like scary, fast, mental rides. It is probably best for",
          "The Roller coasters show your inner self and give you an amazing adrenaline boost, not to mention, the food was alright, but still, prices are always high. Although there was a power cut there, the staff members dealt with it very professionally. This Park is for everyone,",
          "Huge grounds with games/rides suitable for the whole family. Glad that the staff are strict on the height restriction for rides, for safety reasons. Might want to bring along some snacks if you have kids since the food stalls might be far from each other. Look out for the",
          "Me and my two kids went to Chimelong Paradise theme park on the 29th December 2014. The place was easily accesible by Guangzhou metro. Arrived there about 10.30 am and was not packed. My son just loved the roller coaster and rode them a few times. Three of us also rode the",
          "Came here by Guangzhou Metro. The theme park is big,it has several roller coaster rides gives you an adrenaline rush. It also has 3 d theaters showing the green lantern and alien ride. I particularly like the alien ride. The stunt man show like like the water world where there",
          "We went twice on that Roller coaster with my 11 years old son......He was my inspiration! When we almost got to the base the power cut happened............. We consider it rebornation! Food is awful as well as in Safari park. Can survive on ice-cream.",
          "Chimelong includes attractions Disney style i personally went two times in different years with friend to the circus they have some of the best from all over the world, it is very easy to get there by the Chinese metro train at the last stop you can get their own bus for free",
          "Visited chimelong paradise theme park during my visit of guangzhou on nov . Bought the package Ticket together with the safari zoo . Spent half a day on theme park and would said rather disappointing overall . The ride was ok but just too short for every ride lasting like 3 to 5",

          "chimelong paradise was a good amusement park with good attractions and lots of good rides. the lines at the popular thrill rides were quite long so had to choose the few that I couldn't afford to miss out. overall it was fun and worth a visit.",
          "One of the best amusement parks I have been in. The kids loved it and so did the rest of the family. The best thing about it was the friendliness of the staff. Although there was one exception where a young man on stilts in a Halloween outfit seemed to go out of his way to scare",
          "We went last month there and planed to try the most dangerous games in the paradise , there were four games we tried it and it were really scary but we had so much fun .. l recommend that you have to visit it and have a great day with friends or family.",
          "I did not initially intend to stay for long at Chimelong Paradise. We reached at 10am and I was expecting to get bored and leave by 2-3pm. However, the park was pretty huge with many rides that were exhilarating and fun! Most rides provided just enough thrill to get you out of",
          "I have always loved theme parks, and this one did not disappoint. It did not have the same magical feel as Disney parks, but the rides were fantastic! The queues were short, the rides were aplenty, and I had a blast sitting the rides multiple times throughout the day. The",
          "It's cheap, it's good, it has plenty of world class record breaking rides, it has short queues. This is definitely one of the best theme parks I have ever been to! No fuss and no theme, but the best variety of rides I have seen!",
          "A range of rides, including children friendly attractions and looping, water rollercoasters, plus special events such as Halloween and festivals etc. Well worth a visit especially if open late when queues are very short or non-existent and would wait hours if it were a theme",
          "This park has amazing roller coasters and rides but shockingly few guests! I went there on a holiday weekend expecting it to be rammed with people, instead, the ride operators had to wait for more people before they would start each ride. I have been several times at several",
          "This is the best theme park I have ever been to. The dive coaster was amazing, I promised myself to keep my eyes open but the scariest part is the slow journey all the way to the top where you can slowly start to see more and more of chinas horizon, then they stop the ride right",
          "Chimelong has more than 60 attractions, and recently built in a new rollercoaster that is nearly 61m tall & reaches a maximum speed of 105 km per hour!! best place for kids and teenagers! good food, no complaints!!",

          "We have a season pass, and have been many times. As an adult, the roller coasters are awesome. Dive coaster and 10 inversion are great fun, but it's mostly for the kids. My 8 y/o son always has a great time. He loves the bumper cars, but unless it's early or he has an express",
          "This is certainly one of the most enjoyable amusement park I have visited in China. It is easily accessible by MRT and has a wide range of rides. The park was not crowded during my visit on Monday, although there were many school children in uniform. Every rides required no more",

          "Chimelong paradise's 2 main attractions did not disappoint with thrill levels at all. The Giant Dive and The Ten Inversion Coaster were definitely worth the price of admission (200 RMB) alone, my friend and I rode them multiple times. Even with many schools being on site the day",
          "Even with thousands of young kids everywhere, the Chimelong Paradise was a very good experience. A good 10 inversions rollercoaster and another one with a 90\u00ba fall that was really good for rollercoaster lovers.",
          "A very nice park! I always try to fit in an amusement park when I'm around and this was quite special as it had \"clones\" of other big hit rides spread around the globe. I only do adrenaline rides and the ones available here are quite good to be honest. Getting there was easy",
          "I don't know if this is still the case, or if it is normal, but when I first visited Guangzhou, my friend took me here and there were so few people that there was no wait time on any of the rides. That being said, I don't know how much revenue they have to spend on",

          "I you find yourself in the Pearl River Delta region of China you must visit Chimelong Circus. It is the Best Circus On Earth! And The Largest! The show is located in the Chimelong Paradise Resort. I can honestly say I was captivated by all the performers. You will marvel at",
          "The themepark is not too big, but it is good to visit if you bring your children. it is better to purchase family ticket and Chang Long International tickets together. So you can spend whole day in Chang Long.",
          "White tigers are very easy to approach and the whole concept is very well organized with significant space for the animals.",
          "My wife and I visited the park on a Monday. We were warned that the park is swarmed on weekends. The theme park delivered well above our expectations. The rides are categorized into adult and child by height, and the adult rides are quite fun. The food choices are good, and",
          "Been a couple of times as I live near to this fun park. First place I think of to go when friends and family visit. When I first had the chance to go here I was reserved as many places lack attention to detail in China. Chimelong really can rival others around the world.",
          "Sadly the day we visited the rain was a little in and off and so we weren't able to make full use of all the rides. The park holds the rollocoaster with the worlds steepest incline - and wow, it looks terrifying! Not being a rollocoaster lover I did not try it, but I chose some",
          "This park is small but the rides are very thrilling. The Dive Coaster is the ultimate roller coaster in the park. It features a 90 % drop from height and this is absolutely thrilling. Please choose the timing of the visit wisely and do this on a weekdday in the morning where",
          "Went here with a combo ticket to the safari park. Luckily the day we went was rather quiet, so virtually no queues anywhere. As a warning for tall people (like me), a lot of the main coasters and thrill rides have a maximum height of 195cm. If you are around this height or",
          "I am currently studying in Guangzhou and decided to celebrate my birthday on December 27th with a jolly to Chimelong Paradise, China's largest theme park. My friends and I were optimistic that, given it was midweek during school term and the weather was not fantastic, that we",
          "I loved the 10 inverted loop roller coaster ride. The foods are not that expensive compared to other resorts in the world like HK and Singapore. English maps are not displayed so better ask from the staff as soon as you enter the gate. Go on weekday to avoid the long queue on",
          "Let's face it, Guangzhou is a real hole and there's very little worth seeing or doing. The nearby Chimelong Paradise theme park was a great day out with some really good rides. However, there is a reason theme parks in Britain shut for the winter: it poured on the November day",
          "They have a few performances at the park. Even had magic show. An average park for children. The staffs are enthusiastic and some staffs had taken the extra mile to create a fun filling environment for the customers.",
          "We had a blast there, a high recommended attraction for families, you can spend the whole afternoon there playing before hitting the circus which start @ 7 .",
          "It is a very nice amusement park for children of all ages and a must see in Guangzhou! Just bring your own food if not familiar with Chinese food and avoid visiting in Summer. Lots of water games, so be ready to go wet :) If you buy a raincoat, do not trow it away after the game",
          "I was in in Guangzhou with a friend for 3 days so spent a whole day at Chimelong Paradise - it was definitely worth it! The big rides were amazing - the Dive Coaster and 10 Inversion Roller Coaster being my favourite! I went on a couple of times as there was almost no line up!",
          "The amusement park is nice, clean and well organized !!! I'm impressed !! However.. Chimelong's management could upgrade the staffs in order to be able to speak english (so at least most of them could speak bilingual languages); If they do that I will give them a five stars",
          "Went to the amusement park last weekend, and i must say....im speechless...! it was nice , the coasters and rides are just thrilling...except for the fact that theres long queues..you have to wait in line for like 45mins to 1hr...its crazy, so by the end of the day you only end",
          "The safari was as good as those in Florida and the zoo was big with lots of varieties of animals. Tiger show was good but took us ages to walk there because the zoo was huge. Plan your day ahead and you will be rewarded.",
          "I was there for business, i'm sure if you were looking to entertain kids and don't have any qualms about animals behind glass in what seemed to me a restricted space then it could be good. The conference facilities and food was good, the rooms spacious, English speaking TV",
          "It was very nice park. I got there at about 11 and stayed till 18 having enough time. I liked all the most extreme attractions. I was there on Friday but as I trusted other reviewers that a weekend day can be very crowded. Take a Metro to the Hanxi Chanlgong station and from",
          "I have been to this attraction for 2 times. The first time was 11 and the second time was 14. It is very excited and I like it a lot~",
          "it's pitty I went there in winter, actually it will be more interesting in summer. But still , it worth to go .",
          "after reading the reviews i decided to visit chame long paradise , before couple of days i was in ocean park and disney land ,i was shocked from the shows and games there ,the only thing i liked 4d cinema and it was in chinese language , i didn't like it at all ,the ticket price",
          "Don't expect too much! If you've never watched circus before, it's worth to go. Once in a lifetime.",
          "it has more than six grand spectacular roller coasters there and you can have so much fun. but i found it's like a copycat from the busch garden in the states.",
          "This place really surprised me , i did not expect so professional environment. thought it was one of those local theme parks. But wrong. It is big , professional , entertaining . A must visit place in GZ if you have time for fun",
          "Well, it is no Disney Land, but it has some awesome wild rides. It has rides that other theme parks don't have. There is this one ride called Motorbike Coaster. It may only be a short ride experience, but definitely worth the wait! Instead of the usual sitted position, you are",
          "About 1/2 taxi ride outside the centre is this great theme park. 200RMB entrance. There are rides for all the family, various shows and some great thrilling roller-coasters. Some of the best I have been on in a long time! Well worth a day trip",
          "This park has some good rollercoaster rides if you like that kind of thing, me I am like a big kid so it was great tto try the different rides. Also is a very nice park to walk around, clean and tidy and was a good day. There is a show in the main theatre that is well worth a",
          "Chimelong Paradise is an amusement park located in Guangzhou. The good thing about this park is that the activities in the park are very fun to play and there are many of them. There is a water park and a land area to play. So you can enjoy both at the same time or just stay in",
          "We only went to the water park, which was in a surprisingly nice area. We visited during a weekday. Park was not too crowded. Some rides had quite a long line. For Tornado they filling up the tubes (4 persons), which meant we as a party of 3 had to wait some time for a single",
          "It was august when we went to chimelong paradise, a hot sunny day. I rate \"CP\" 10 and Disneyland hk 5 because in Disney its focus for children. Chimelong's paradise rides were the best. They have this 10 loop roller coaster that I can not ever forget , it is so fast and worth",
          "I went on a Sat in jan and found there to be no queues at all, this was great as we could do many of the rides multiple times. The range of rides was good with a few white knuckle as well as more family orientated ones. I wasn't too keen on the food served here but that is a",
          "THis is a great amusement park, and is not a cheesy, ghetto Chinese theme park. It is very Western in how it looks, and feels and has awesome rides. But it does not have any decent Western food, so bring in something to eat or you may starve as we did. Seriously, nothing edible",
          "Chimelong is Guangzhou's answer to Disney World. It is funky, very Chinese, and at times unsettling (the zoo has its ups and downs) but fascinating. The zoo has a very interesting white tiger feeding demonstration and a number of pandas (they were even awake!). The circus is a",
          "Many exciting and fast rides. With our young children, we stayed with ground level rides and those tend to be a bit older. Don't expect too much and you'll feel better. The shows are good. The stunt show is great, but it could get very loud. We brought earplugs.",
          "Fast-paced - no breaks between performances. Quality acrobatics. Worth going to.",
          "little far from the central but it's worth going over there... take a metro and pay several rmb and have tons of fun",
          "Very lively place to relax with friends.... We were 5 people in group and had a lot of fun. The rides are quite thrilling.",
          "Good, but not great, for be in China. Can not compare amusemant parks with the western world, but sure you can have a nice day here. It is not Disney, but it is a amusement park. Only 200 rmb.",
          "Chimelong is a real fun place in the Guangzhou region. We got the metro from yuexiu park and it took 50 mins and cost us like 6rmb. Don't bother waiting for the shuttle once u get to hangxi changlong station as it's a 150m walk to the south gate. Prob best to get an english",
          "Theme Park - Went on a weekday, not many people,. Did not need to queue for the rides. Some of the rides not suitable for small children. Food was so-so, theme park prices. But place was well-kept, clean. Did not stay at the hotel as it was expensive, stayed in Ramada, which",
          "We visited on a Wednesday and had the best time. We waited maximum of 10 mins for any ride and did the whole park in a few hours, some rides twice. Rides are not for the feint-hearted! The park was well organised and seemed very safe. Well worth a visit during the week. The",
          "Chimelong Paradise was fun, but it is definitely not a place you would want to go to during the weekend or a Chinese holiday. I went there with a couple of friends on Saturday. It was dreadful. The whole place was packed with people, you had to wait at least thirty minutes for a",
          "We had a day to burn in Guangzhou. Our hotel room had a travel guide, so we found the Chimelong Paradise Resort with a theme park that looked like fun. Fun, yes - to a degree, a couple of rides to entertain adults, a water show that was in Chinese and hardly any english speaking",
          "We visited Chimelong Paradise last May 27, 2010. It was fun, there are many types of rides for people of different convictions and varying risk adversities. Any one from age 5- 45 years old have a ride to try , no unnecessary benching, no excuse not to try even one. There are",

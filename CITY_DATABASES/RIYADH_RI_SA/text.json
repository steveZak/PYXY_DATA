        "wiki": "Riyadh (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0636\u200e, romanized: ar-Riy\u0101\u1e0d, lit. 'The Gardens' [ar.ri\u02c8ja\u02d0d\u02e4] Najdi pronunciation: [er.r\u026a\u02c8j\u0251\u02d0\u00f0\u02e4]) is the capital of Saudi Arabia and the largest city on the Arabian Peninsula. Located in the center of the an-Nafud desert, on the eastern part of the Najd plateau, the city sits at an average of 600 metres (2,000 ft) above sea level, and receives more than 16 million tourists each year, making it the 2nd most visited city in the Arab world. Riyadh had a population of 7.6 million people in 2019, making it the most populous city in Saudi Arabia, 2nd most populous in the Arab world (after Cairo), and 38th most populous in Asia.The first mentioning of the city by the name Riyadh was in 1590, by an early Arab chronicler. In 1737, Deham Ibn Dawwas, who was from the neighboring Manfuha, settled in and took control of the city. Deham built a wall around the city, and the best known source of the name Riyadh is from this period, thought to be referring to the earlier oasis towns that predated the wall built by Ibn Dawwas. In 1744, Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab formed an alliance with the Emir of Dir'iyah, Muhammad bin Saud, and in 1774, they took Riyadh from Deham. However their state, now known as the First Saudi State, came to a collapse in 1818. Turki ibn Abdullah founded the Second Saudi State in the early 19th century and made Riyadh his capital in 1825. However, his reign over the city was disrupted by a joint Ottoman\u2013Rashidi alliance. Finally, in the early 20th century, 'Abdulaziz ibn Saud, known in the west simply as Ibn Saud, retrieved his ancestral kingdom of Najd in 1902 and consolidated his rule by 1926 with the final Saudi conquest of Hejaz. After this he named his kingdom Saudi Arabia in September 1932 with Riyadh as the capital.Riyadh is the political and administrative centre of Saudi Arabia. The Consultative Assembly (also known as the Shura or Shura Council), the Council of Ministers of Saudi Arabia, the King and the Supreme Judicial Council of Saudi Arabia are all situated in the city. Alongside these four bodies that form the core of the legal system of Saudi Arabia, the headquarters of other major and minor governmental bodies are also located in Riyadh. The city hosts 112 foreign embassies, most of which are located in the as-Safarat district or Diplomatic Quarter (Arabic: \u062d\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a\u200e, romanized: Hayy as-Safarat, lit. 'District of Embassies') in the western reaches of the city.\nRIyadh also holds great economic significance, as it hosts the headquarters of many banks and major companies, such as the National Commercial Bank (NCB), Alinma Bank and the Saudi Arabian British Bank (SABB). Highway 65, known locally as the King Fahd Road, runs through some of these important centers in the city, including the King Abdullah Financial District, one of the world's largest financial districts, the Faisaliyah Center and the Kingdom Center. Riyadh is one of the world's fastest-growing cities in population and is home to many expatriates. Riyadh has been designated a global city.The city is divided into 15 municipal districts, which are overseen by the Municipality of Riyadh (Arabic: \u0623\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0636\u200e, romanized: Amanat ar-Riyad, lit. 'Protectorate of Riyadh') headed by the mayor; and the Royal Commission for Riyadh which is chaired by the Governor of the Province, Faisal bin Bandar Al Saud. As of July 2020, The mayor is Faisal bin Abdulaziz bin Mohammed bin Ayyaf Al-Muqrin. Most of the population of the Riyadh Province is concentrated around Riyadh, as the rest of the province is mostly desert, with few, small cities connected by small two- to four-lane highways, such as Wadi ad-Dawasir.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nDuring the Pre-Islamic era the city at the site of modern Riyadh was called Hajr (Arabic: \u062d\u062c\u0631\u200e), and was reportedly founded by the tribe of Banu Hanifa. Hajr served as the capital of the province of Al-Yamamah, whose governors were responsible for most of central and eastern Arabia during the Umayyad and Abbasid eras. Al-Yamamah broke away from the Abbasid Empire in 866 and the area fell under the rule of the Ukhaydhirites, who moved the capital from Hajr to nearby Al-Kharj. The city then went into a long period of decline. In the 14th century, North African traveler Ibn Battuta wrote of his visit to Hajr, describing it as \"the main city of Al-Yamamah, and its name is Hajr\". Ibn Battuta goes on to describe it as a city of canals and trees with most of its inhabitants belonging to the Bani Hanifa, and reports that he continued on with their leader to Mecca to perform the Hajj.\nLater on, Hajr broke up into several separate settlements and estates. The most notable of these were Migrin (or Muqrin) and Mi'kal, though the name Hajr continued to appear in local folk poetry. The earliest known reference to the area by the name Riyadh comes from a 17th-century chronicler reporting on an event from the year 1590. In 1737, Deham ibn Dawwas, a refugee from neighboring Manfuha, took control of Riyadh. Ibn Dawwas built a single wall to encircle the various oasis town in the area, making them effectively a single city. The name \"Riyadh,\" meaning \"gardens\" refers to these earlier oasis towns.\n\n\n=== First Saudi State ===\n\nIn 1744, Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab formed an alliance with Muhammad ibn Saud, the ruler of the nearby town of Diriyah. Ibn Saud then set out to conquer the surrounding region with the goal of bringing it under the rule of a single Islamic state. Ibn Dawwas of Riyadh led the most determined resistance, allied with forces from Al Kharj, Al Ahsa, and the Banu Yam clan of Najran. However, Ibn Dawwas fled and Riyadh capitulated to the Saudis in 1774, ending long years of wars, and leading to the declaration of the First Saudi State, with Diriyah as its capital.The First Saudi State was destroyed by forces sent by Muhammad Ali of Egypt, acting on behalf of the Ottoman Empire. Ottoman forces razed the Saudi capital Diriyah in 1818. They had maintained a garrison at Najd. This marked the decline of the House of Saud for a short time. Turki bin Abdullah bin Muhammad became the first Amir of the Second Saudi State; the cousin of Saud bin Saud, he ruled for 19 years till 1834, leading to the consolidation of the area though they were notionally under the control of the Muhammad Ali, the Viceroy of Egypt. In 1823, Turki ibn Abdallah chose Riyadh as the new capital. Following the assassination of Turki in 1834, his eldest son Faisal killed the assassin and took control, and refused to be controlled by the Viceroy of Egypt. Najd was then invaded and Faisal taken captive and held in Cairo. However, as Egypt became independent of the Ottoman Empire, Faisal escaped after five years of incarceration, returned to Najd and resumed his reign, ruled till 1865, and consolidated the reign of House of Saud.Following the death of Faisal, there was rivalry among his sons which situation was exploited by Muhammad bin Rashid who took most of Najd, signed a treaty with the Ottomans and also captured Hasa in 1871. In 1889, Abdul Rahman bin Faisal, the third son of Faisal again regained control over Najd and ruled till 1891, whereafter the control was regained by Muhammad bin Raschid.Internecine struggles between Turki's grandsons led to the fall of the Second Saudi State in 1891 at the hand of the rival Al Rashid clan, which ruled from the northern city of Ha'il. The al-Masmak fort dates from that period.Abdul Rahman bin Faisal al-Saud had sought refuge among a tribal community on the outskirts of Najd and then went to Kuwait with his family and stayed in exile. However, his son Abdul Aziz retrieved his ancestral kingdom of Najd in 1902 and consolidated his rule by 1926, and further expanded his kingdom to cover \"most of the Arabian Peninsula.\" He named his kingdom as Saudi Arabia in September 1932 with Riyadh as the capital. King Abdul Aziz died in 1953 and his son Saud took control as per the established succession rule of father to son from the time Muhammad bin Saud had established the Saud rule in 1744. However, this established line of succession was broken when King Saud was succeeded by his brother King Faisal in 1964. In 1975, Faisal was succeeded by his brother King Khalid. In 1982, King Fahd took the reins from his brother. This new line of succession is among the sons of King Abdul Aziz who has 35 sons; this large family of Ibn Saud hold all key positions in the large kingdom.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nFrom the 1940s, Riyadh mushroomed from a relatively narrow, spatially isolated town into a spacious metropolis. When King Saud came to power, he made it his objective to modernize Riyadh, and began developing Annasriyyah, the royal residential district, in 1950. Following the example of American cities, new settlements and entire neighbourhoods were created on grid plans, and connected by high-capacity main roads to the inner areas. The grid pattern in the city was introduced in 1953. The population growth of the town from 1974-1992 averaged 8.2 percent per year.\nThe mayor is Prince Faisal bin Abdulaziz. Bin Abdulaziz was appointed in 2019 by royal decree  and succeeds Tariq bin Abdul Aziz Al-Faris. Riyadh is now the administrative, and to a great extent the commercial hub of the Kingdom. According to the Saudi Real Estate Companion, most large companies in the country establish either sole headquarters or a large office in the city. For this reason, there has been a significant growth in high rise developments in all areas of the city. Most notable among these is King Abdullah Financial District which is fast becoming the key business hub in the city. Riyadh also has the largest all-female university in the world, the Princess Nora bint Abdul Rahman University.According to the Global Financial Centres Index, Riyadh ranked at 77 in 2016\u20132017. Though the rank moved up to 69 in 2018, diversification in the economy of the capital is required in order to avoid what the World Bank called a \"looming poverty crisis\" brought on by lingering low oil prices and rich state benefits.Since 2017, Riyadh has been the target of missiles from Yemen. In March 2018, one person died as a result of a missile attack. The number of missiles which targeted Riyadh are a small portion of the dozens of missiles fired from Yemen at Saudi Arabia due to the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. In April 2018, heavy gunfire was heard in Khozama; this led to rumors of a coup attempt.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nRiyadh has a hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification BWh), with long, extremely hot summers and short, very mild winters. The average high temperature in August is 43.6 \u00b0C (110.5 \u00b0F). The city experiences very little precipitation, especially in summer, but receives a fair amount of rain in March and April. It is also known to have dust storms during which the dust can be so thick that visibility is under 10 m (33 ft). On 1 and 2 April 2015, a massive dust storm hit Riyadh, causing suspension of classes in many schools in the area and cancellation of hundreds of flights, both domestic and international.\n\n\n=== City districts ===\n\nRiyadh is divided into fourteen branch municipalities, in addition to the Diplomatic Quarter. Each branch municipality in turn contains several districts, amounting to over 130 in total, though some districts are divided between more than one branch municipality. The branch municipalities are Al-Shemaysi, Irqah, Al-Ma'athar, Al-Olayya, Al-Aziziyya, Al-Malaz, Al-Selayy, Nemar, Al-Neseem, Al-Shifa, Al-'Urayja, Al-Bat'ha, Al-Ha'ir, Al-Rawdha, and Al-Shimal (\"the North\"). Olaya District is the commercial heart of the city, with accommodation, entertainment, dining and shopping options. The Kingdom Centre, Al Faisalyah and Al-Tahlya Street are the area's most prominent landmarks. The centre of the city, Al-Bathaa and Al-Deerah, is also its oldest part.\nSome of the main districts of Riyadh are:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe city had a population of 40,000 inhabitants in 1935 and 83,000 in 1949. The city has experienced very high rates of population growth, from 150,000 inhabitants in the 1960s to over seven million, according to the most recent sources. As of 2017, the population of Riyadh is composed of 64.19% Saudis, while non-Saudis account for 35.81% of the population. Indians are the largest minority population at 13.7%, followed by Pakistanis at 12.4%.\n\n\n== Landmarks and architecture ==\n\n\n=== Vernacular architecture of Old Riyadh ===\nThe old town of Riyadh within the city walls did not exceed an area of 1 km2, and therefore very few significant architectural remnants of the original walled oasis town of Riyadh exist today. The most prominent is the Masmak fort and some parts of the original wall structure with its gate which have been restored and reconstructed. There are also a number of traditional mud-brick houses within these old limits, but they are for the most part dilapidated.\nExpansion outside the city walls was slow to begin with, although there were some smaller oases and settlements surrounding Riyadh. The first major construction beyond the walls was King Abdulaziz's Murabba Palace. It was constructed in 1936, completed in 1938, and a household of 800 people moved into it in 1938. The palace is now part of a bigger complex called The King Abdulaziz Historical Centre.\nThere are other traditional villages and towns in the area around traditional Riyadh which the urban sprawl reached and encompasses. These include Diriyah, Manfuha and Wadi Laban. Unlike in the early days of development in Riyadh during which vernacular structures were razed to the ground without consideration, there is a new-found appreciation for traditional architecture. The Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage is making efforts to revitalize the historic architecture in Riyadh and other parts of the kingdom.\nAin Heet CaveAin Heet cave has an underground lake (150 meters deep) situated at the face of Mount Al Jubayl in Wadi As Sulay in a small village called Heet in Riyadh. Between Riyadh and Al Kharj road, it is one of the easily accessible caves in the area of Riyadh.\n\n\n=== Archaeological sites ===\nThe archeological sites at Riyadh which are of historical importance, in which the Municipality of Riyadh is involved, are the five old gates on the old walls of Riyadh. These are the eastern gate of Thumaira, the northern gate of Al-Suwailen, the southern gate of Dukhna, the western gate of Al-Madhbah and the south-western gate of Shumaisi. There are also four historic palaces: Musmak Palace, Murabba Palace (palace of King Abdul Aziz), Atiqah Palace (belongs to Prince Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman) and Al Shamsiah Palace (belongs to Saud Al Kabeer).\n\n\n==== Turaif district ====\n\nThe Turaif district, is another important archaeological site inscribed in UNESCO World Heritage List on 31 July 2010. It was founded in the 15th century bearing an architectural style of Najdi. There are some Historic palaces and monuments in Al-Turaif district include: Salwa Palace, Saad bin Saud Palace, The Guest House and At-Turaif Bath House, and Imam Mohammad bin Saud Mosque.\n\n\n==== Masmak Fortress ====\n\nThis fortress was built around 1865 under the reign of Mohammed ibn Abdullah ibn Rasheed (1289-1315 AH), the ruler of Ha'il to the north, who had wrested control of the city from the rival clan of Al Saud. In January 1902 Ibn Saud, who was at the time living in exile in Kuwait, succeeded in capturing the Masmak fortress from its Rashid garrison. The event, which restored Saudi control over Riyadh, has acquired almost mythical status in the history of Saudi Arabia. The story of the event is often retold, and has as its central theme the heroism and bravery of the King Abd Abdulaziz Ibn Saud. \nThe Masmak Fortress is now a museum and is in close proximity to the Clock Tower Square, also known to English-speaking residents as Chop Chop Square, referring to the capital punishment that takes place there.\n\n\n=== Contemporary architecture ===\n\n\n==== Kingdom Centre ====\n\nDesigned by the team of Ellerbe Becket and Omrania, the tower is built on 94,230 square metres of land. The Kingdom Centre is owned by a group of companies including Kingdom Holding Company, headed by Al-Waleed bin Talal, a prince of the Saudi royal family, and is the headquarters of the holding company. The project cost 2 billion Saudi Arabian Riyals and the contract was undertaken by El-Seif. The Kingdom Centre is the winner of the 2002 Emporis Skyscraper Award, selected as the \"best new skyscraper of the year for design and functionality\". A three-level shopping centre, which also won a major design award, fills the east wing. The large opening is illuminated at night in continuously changing colours. The shopping centre has a separate floor for women only to shop where men are not allowed to enter.\nThe Kingdom Tower has 99 stories and is the third tallest structure in the country (behind Makkah Royal Clock Tower Hotel in Mecca and Burj Rafal in Riyadh), rising to 300 m. A special aspect of the tower is that it is divided into two parts in the last one third of its height and is linked by a sky-bridge walkway, which provides stunning views of Riyadh.\n\n\n==== Burj Rafal Hotel Kempinski ====\n\nBurj Rafal, located on King Fahd Road, is the tallest skyscraper in Riyadh at 307.9 meters (1,010 feet) tall. The tower was designed and engineered by P & T Group. Construction began in 2010 and was completed 2014. The project was considered a success, with 70% of the residential units already sold by the time the skyscraper was topped out. The tower contains 474 residential condominium units and a 349-room 5-star Kempinski hotel.\n\n\n==== Burj Al Faisaliyah ====\n\nAl Faisaliyah Centre (Arabic: \u0628\u0631\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u0635\u0644\u064a\u0629) is the first skyscraper constructed in Saudi Arabia, and is the third tallest building in Riyadh after the Burj Rafal and the Kingdom Centre. The golden ball that lies atop the tower is said to be inspired by a ballpoint pen, and contains a restaurant; immediately below this is an outside viewing deck. There is a shopping centre with major world brands at ground level. Al Faisaliyah Centre also has a hotel at both sides of the tower while the main building is occupied by office. The Al Faisaliyah Tower has 44 stories. It was designed by Foster and Partners.\n\n\n==== Riyadh TV Tower ====\n\nThe Riyadh TV Tower is a 170 meter high television tower located inside the premises of the Saudi Ministry of Information. It is a vertical cantilever structure which was built between 1978\u201381. The first movie made in 1983 by the TV tower group and named \"1,000 Nights and Night\" had Mohammed Abdu and Talal Mmdah as the main characters. At that time, there were no women on TV because of religious restrictions. Three years later, Abdul Khaliq Al-Ghanim produced a TV series called \"Tash Ma Tash,\" which earned a good reaction from audiences in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. This series created a media revolution back in the 1980s.\n\n\n=== Museums and collections ===\nIn 1999, a new central museum was built in Riyadh, at the eastern side of the King Abdul Aziz Historical Centre. The National Museum of Saudi Arabia combined several collections and pieces that had up until then been scattered over several institutions and other places in Riyadh and the Kingdom. For example, the meteorite fragment known as the \"Camel's Hump\",  recovered in 1966 from the Wabar site, that was on display at the King Saud University in Riyadh became the new entry piece of the National Museum of Saudi Arabia.\nThe Royal Saudi Air Force Museum, or Saqr Al-Jazira, is located on the East Ring Road of Riyadh between exits 10 and 11. It contains a collection of aircraft and aviation-related items used by the Royal Saudi Air Force and Saudia (Saudi Arabian Airlines).\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nFootball is the most popular sport in Saudi Arabia. The city hosts four major football clubs, Al Hilal was established in 1957 and has won 15 championships in the Saudi Professional League. Al-Nasr club is another team in the top league that has many supporters around the kingdom. It was established in 1955, and has been named champion of the Saudi League 7 times.Another well-known club, Al-Shabab, was established in 1947 and holds 6 championships. There is also Al-Riyadh Club, which was established in 1954, as well as many other minor clubs.The city also has several large stadiums such as King Fahd International Stadium with a seating capacity of 70,000. The stadium hosted the FIFA Confederations Cup three times, in the years 1992, 1995 and 1997. It also hosted the FIFA U-20 World Cup in 1989, and Prince Faisal bin Fahd Stadium (Al-Malaz Stadium) that is used mostly for football matches. The stadium has a capacity of 22,500 people.\nThe city's GPYW Indoor Stadium served as host arena for the 1997 Asian Basketball Championship, where Saudi Arabia's national basketball team reached the Final Four.\nOn 29 February 2020, the world's richest thoroughbred horse race will take place at the King Abdulaziz Racetrack in Riyadh. The Saudi Cup is a new race for thoroughbreds aged four and up, to be run at weight-for-age terms over 1800m (9f). The prize money is US$20m with a prize of US$10m to the winner and prize money down to tenth place. The Saudi Cup is perfectly positioned between the Pegasus World Cup and the Dubai World Cup to attract the best horses from around the world to compete for horse racing's richest prize. Putting the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on the international horseracing map, the Saudi Cup will also hold an undercard of international races on both dirt and the new turf course.\nOn 26 April 2020, Saudi Arabia entered the bidding process for the 2030 Asian Games, there main rival for this event is Doha, Qatar.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Airport ===\n\nRiyadh's King Khalid International Airport (KKIA), located 35 kilometers north from the city centre, is the city's main airport, and serves over 17 million passengers a year. Plans are being made to expand the airport to accommodate 35 million passengers, given that the airport was only built for 12 million passengers annually. A possible new airport is on the table. It is one of the largest airports in the world by land area.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nThe city is served by a modern major highway system. The main Eastern Ring Road connects the city's south and north, while the Northern Ring Road connects the city's east and west. King Fahd Road runs through the centre of the city from north to south, in parallel with the East Ring Road. Makkah Road, which runs east\u2013west across the city's centre, connects eastern parts of the city with the city's main business district and the diplomatic quarters.\n\n\n=== Railways and metro ===\nSaudi Railways Organization operates two separate passenger and cargo lines between Riyadh and Dammam, passing through Hofuf and Haradh. Two future railway projects, connecting Riyadh with Jeddah and Mecca in the western region, and connecting Riyadh with Buraidah, Ha'il and Northern Saudi Arabia are underway. A metro is also under construction, with six lines under construction with a scheduled opening in 2020.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nThe metro system will be integrated with an 85 kilometres (53 mi), three-line bus rapid transit (BRT) network.The main charter bus company in the kingdom, known as the Saudi Public Transport Company (SAPTCO), offers trips both within the kingdom and to its neighboring countries, including Egypt (via ferries from Safaga or Nuweiba) and Arab states of the Persian Gulf.\n\n\n== Media ==\nThe 170 m (560 ft) Riyadh TV Tower, operated by the Ministry of Information, was built between 1978 and 1981.\nNational Saudi television channels Saudi TV1, Saudi TV2, Saudi TV Sports, Al-Ekhbariya, ART channels network operate from here.

Archaeological evidence shows tin could only be mined in Bavaria, Afghanistan and Cornwall. Tin's rarity made it costly to upkeep empires limiting the size of their armies.

Abd al Aziz commands a successful raid with 40 camel riders on the Masmak Fort in a bold attempt to reclaim his families lands; honourably besieging the Rash\u012bd garrison under the rule of the Al Rash\u012bd Governor in Najd, Riyadh. A famous battle is pitched between Nobility establishing Abd al Aziz as the Al Sa\u016bd leader and Wahhabi Imam.\n1904 June 15, Ibn Rash\u012bd appeals to the Ottoman Empire for assistance after a series of setbacks to the Sa\u016bd; the Rash\u012bd\u012b begin to reconsolidate their forces in central Arabia.\n1907\u20131912, The Ottoman Empire withdraws military support from the desultory infighting amongst the Rash\u012bd\u012b and Sa\u016bd factions.\n1910 - Population: 14,000.\n1915 December, Ibn Sa\u016bd signs a protectorate treaty with the British Empire for a small subsidy and enters the war against Ibn Rash\u012bd who was supported by the Ottoman Empire.\n1919 - Royal family relocates to Riyadh.\n1921, Shar\u012bf Husayn's son 'Abd All\u0101h becomes the rulers of Transjordan and a second son Faysal becomes the Sultan of Iraq.\n1924, 'Ibn Sa\u016bd now rules Central Arabia except the Hejaz province along the Red Sea.

          "If you come on a summer afternoon, be ready for the HEAT and sun. I have a slightly different take on the Riyadh zoo. First of all, I think it is a great oasis in a city that is truly a concrete jungle. Riyadh is not a pedestrian friendly city. Here is a nice place where you",
          "Huge zoo. You will see almost everything there. But because it is Riyadh, i.e you are literally in the of the desert, it is like 70 degrees Celsius (158 F) under the sun. So you will be burn to death before you reach the monkeys cage :D",

          "We took the kids there on a weekend. It has many animals and the kids liked it. We went around easy even it was crowded. They have to put clear information about animals. People should stop throwing food at animals. It also needs more sign to know your way through.",
          "Shocking, to see the animals there being treated in such away as they were, dirty water and full of debris. No food in the animals pen, people throwing food, plastic bottles (empty) at the animals Shocking behaviour, will never return again, should be closed down for the sake",

          "I have been to the Riyadh Zoo 2-3 times with my kids and family friends. They have a good collection of animals and the entire facility is good. Generally people come with kids & maybe with family friends to have a get together. You can have bring your own food or get something",
          "This is one of most compact zoo I have visited. You can watch Kangaroo and Ostrich in the same area and this is replicated across zoo. I found this thought nice as it reduces human effort to look around zoo, saves your time and you can see what you came to see. We went around",
          "We have been there twice now. Actually compared to the zoo in Doha, the animals have nice cages. However, we still don't like the fact that everybody is just throwing food and plastic bottles in to the habitats. The monkeys were drinking juice from a plastic bottle and eating",

          "A visit to the Riyadh zoo was a good overall experience. The pathways re wide and there are lots of English notices about the animals in the different containment areas. The layout of the zoo is very practical and the animals do not seem to be cramped in cages like one find in",
          "Riyadh or Malaz Zoo, as it is called locally, is very popular picnic spot.There is no good collection of animal it is rather an small zoo if we compare internationally, though it may be the biggest zoo in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. However it is neat and clean and animals are",
          "The zoo really isn't much of a zoo, with only a handful of animals in pretty sorry conditions, but nonetheless, it's something to go and see in Riyadh and is a good spot for a picnic. There is a small restaurant onsite that serves pretty good food and great prices and there's",
          "Great Out door experience in the capital of saudi arabia, best for families or groups.. everyone is going to the malls, spending cash they shouldnt and eating stuff that aint good, this is a great place for a picnic and you can spend half a day there, it really is what you make",
          "Yet again the Riyadh Zoo is good at one thing only: disappointing.... The animals there are the most unhappy creatures I have ever seen at any zoo in the world. The seal should be on suicide watch, the water in his enclosure is dark green and filthy. I don't recommend the food",
          "The clean environment, the huge and marvelous terrains/landscape keeps your visit cool and enjoyable plus the many different animal species will catch you interest. Nice place to take home photos as a souvenir of the place.",
          "it is darty smell bad and unorgnized the sigens are out dated. I am sure the money for the zoo is going for something else!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
          "When i wrote the review i thought that the people who work at the zoo will take notice of what i said but Alas !! it hasn't changed at all and not even the people in the high levels who look after the zoo have taken any notice of what is being said about this terrible place!",
          "While the animals at the zoo have plenty of room to roam, the amount of garbage is horrible. Seeing alligators covered in garbage is pretty terrible. Food stalls are excellent. The entrance fee is so low that it makes sense that very little maintenance is attempted. For an",
          "the zoo is a reasonable size, but is out of date and not modernazed, tickets are very cheap, can be interesting for children, but make sure you go in the afternoon to avoid sun heat, good time for visiting is during winter months",

          "Unlike what was described to me i found it quiet good and worth spending some time too. 3hrs of time is decent enough for this place and bet u wont repent . Wont rate among the best but neither among the worst ones.",
          "Every time my family visits Riyadh, the kids would ask to go and visit the zoo! Who wouldn't? The kids have a first-hand experience with animals and they love to see these creatures come to life. The place is huge and the animals are well kept! When the kids are tired of",
          "This is a sad dismal concrete palace with apathetic mistreated understimulated animals. Wish the SPCA could rescue all the animals :(",

          "I can't believe that this is a country where there are Muslims as they lack kindness, sensitivity and compassion to Animals. You can tell a lot about the people and the place when you see them how they treat their animals! all of them are oblivious to this horrible",
          "One of the most horrible experiences of my life. I cried my eyes out after leaving the place of pure evil. The animals are not looked after and the people have no respect for them. Feeding the monkeys rice and chicken, throwing anything they can find at the animals. Also found",
          "The people at the entrance are borderline rude and you don't know when it is family day or singles day etc. They wanted to take my cell phone because it had a camera and put it in a box with many other phones and not in a locker or pigeon hole.",
          "Being an Animal Lover, I m not that happy to see the Animals are all kept imprisoned, but I guess this is best you can get in the middle of a desert in Saudi Arabia. It is nearly impossible to create a national park in Saudi Arabia where all these Animals can be left in their",
          "This is the worse zoo I have ever saw. The way animals are treated is so sad. People throw trash at them while the guards just watch. They are in bad living situations and seem to have more manners then the people who visit. I can not believe a country this rich has such a place",
          "nothing to see all the animals are sleeping or in the room baad rrestaurant",
          "A really miserable place that you will try hard to forget. This is a cruel place with the animals being instituitionally mistreated. Do yourself a favor and avoid it. There are better places in Riyadh to visit where you will not leave feeking really sorry for these poor",
          "This zoo includes unique collection of lynxes which I have never seen in any other zoo,I went there with my wife in Friday when it's opened for families,at 1 pm,it was quiet as people have not started to come,lions and tigers are beautiful and well cared of.",
          "nothing to see + bad smell it is the worst thing I've ever seen",
          "Whilst the location and picnic areas was pleasant enough, I was deeply sadened by this zoo - to see the animals in poorly maintained cages with little stimulation; people throwing fruit boxes and lollies/chupachubs to the monkeys to eat, feeding popcorn to the elephants; the",
          "A dirty place where animals are kept under terrible circumstances. Just one of the saddest places in Riyadh. A place like the Maha resort in the UAE would be a much more appropriate type of 'zoo' experience suitable to Saudi climate than this.",
          "Had a good day out. A fair variety of animals. Had some concerns over the suitability of the habitats and rubbish littering some animal enclosures. Was also shocked to see some children feeding the elephants crisps while the parents watched on! If you plan a visit take care",
          "I have been to Dubai and Al Ain Zoos in the United Arab Emirates. But none of them come close to the charm of Riyadh Zoo. The variety of wild life on display and the way it is organized is excellent. The bad side of this place is the way people feed the animals. The best place",

          "Was better than I expected. The elephant cheekily tried to take my buggy cover :) big cats deserve bigger enclosures (oxymoron). Worth a trip on family day.",

          "The park itself is attractive, palm trees, lake with flamingos, green areas, but many of the animals are in enclosures which are too restrictive and offer little stimulation. A fair range of animals though, and the reptile house is well worth a visit.",
          "I visited the Riyadh Zoo in March 2012 with some friends here. My first impression wasn't that good... A lot of space, and few animals... All animals looked grey... No coloured animals... even the flamingo's at the entrance were grey-pink... please guys... they need food and",

          "This is a lovely zoo, and I usually hate and avoid them, as the animals have open range enclosures, much like Taronga Park zoo in Sydney, in fact, I'd go so far as to say it would have been built by the same people. It is probably the most attractive thing in Riyadh, as there",
          "Nice place to spend an evening at a clean place with your family",
          "First of all and most important to travellers is that men and ladies can't go at the same time and that should be a put-off right away. Otherwise it is a rather nice zoo although the animals could be metter looked after;",

          "We live in Riyadh and there's not a great deal to do that doesn't involve shopping in malls. The zoo is one of those very few things that are worth doing together as a family. It costs just 10SAR (less then \u00a32) for adults to get in. The animals are in big enclosers and all",
          "The zoo is very nice, we spent a great day with our children and friends. A visit to' the zoo is one of the things that you can do in Riyadh, some people have a pic-nik on the grass, there is a little train that children like, there are some coffee-shop and a resturant. Finally,",
          "I quite liked the Zoo in Riyadh, i found it had many different animals, many of which were active, not sleepy like in most zoos i go to. My kids loved the Bear, cheeky Monkeys and the Elephants. Although quite smelly, i was surprised the people were actually having a picnic",
          "I visited the zoo on the 31st Jan 2011. I believe that after reading previous reviews about the zoo that it looks as though things have much improved. I found that the animals seemed content and happy although I do admit one or two looked old and worn but that's life!!",

        "wiki": "The King Abdul Aziz Historical Centre is a region in the city of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. It is not the \"historic center\" of the city as this lies to the south around Masmak fort and the main Friday Mosque\" in the Dira district. The origin of the King Abdul Aziz Historical Centre is the former compound of the Murabba' Palace, that was built in 1936/37 by King Abdul Aziz about one and a half kilometers to the north of the old city and well outside of the then still existing city walls. \nAfter 1953 the palace compound ceased to be used as main royal residence and slowly fell into disuse. The \"Murabba' Development Project\" was later started to make use of the area for projects involved with the Centennial Celebrations in 1999. As such the area was chosen to be the site of several cultural institutions focusing on the national history in general and the history of the current Saudi State and its founder in detail. Consequently what had remained of the old palace compound buildings was restored or remodeled on plans similar to the original buildings. The surrounding area was made into a landscape of parks and plazas and new buildings were built such as the National Museum of Saudi Arabia.\nThe units on the west side of the area are from south to north: A remodeled mosque, the old original Murabba' Palace with main Diwan renovated as \"living museum\", the \"Memorial Hall\" on the outlines of an old courtyard house, a modern exhibition hall for the car collection, on the footprints of the old majlis and assembly hall the new Al-Dara main lobby and multipurpose hall, a documentation center with a separated men's and women's library each, an art gallery and a large internal garden. On the east side the new National Museum of Saudi Arabia was built together with the King Abdul Aziz Foundation for Research and Archives. To the south the area around the old water tower has been remodelled and now includes a small theme park. The whole project is said to have cost some 680 million Saudi riyals (about 181.33 million U.S. dollars at the time) and covers an area of some 360,000 square meters (3,000,000 sq ft).\n\n\n== Notes and references ==",

        "wiki": "Kingdom Centre (Arabic: \u0645\u0631\u0643\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0629\u200e) is a 99-story, 302.3 m (992 ft) skyscraper in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. When completed in 2002, it overtook the 267-meter Faisaliyah Tower as the tallest tower in Saudi Arabia. It has since been surpassed and is now the fifth-tallest skyscraper in the country, whose tallest two buildings are the Abraj Al Bait Towers and the Capital Market Authority Tower. It is the world's third-tallest building with a hole after the Shanghai World Financial Center and the 85 Sky Tower in Taiwan.\nThe mixed-use tower was developed by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal and designed by the team of Ellerbe Becket and Omrania, who were selected through an international design competition. It is situated on a 100,000\u2013square-metre site and houses the 57,000-square-meter Al-Mamlaka shopping mall, offices, the Four Seasons Hotel Riyadh, and luxury apartments. There is a 65m skybridge atop the skyscraper.The upper third of the tower features an inverted parabolic arch topped by a public sky bridge. The sky bridge is a 300-ton steel structure, taking the form of an enclosed corridor with windows on both sides. After paying the admission fees, visitors take two elevators to reach that level.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe Kingdom Centre was designed by the US-based architecture firm Ellerbe Becket in a joint venture with the Riyadh-based architecture and engineering firm Omrania and Associates.\nThe building is composed of a tower and a podium comprising two symmetrical wings. The tower's almond-shaped plan and curving forms gives the building a distinctive shape that helps keep it cool, with the narrow ends facing the east and west where heat gain is greatest. A high-performance curtain wall, made from silver, butt-jointed reflective glazing, also helps control heat gain while concealing the three main mechanical floors to create a seamless facade.At the top of the tower, an inverted arch is spanned by a glass skybridge housing a public observation deck. The large opening allows the building to rise higher than the height limit\u201430 occupied floors\u2014mandated by local laws. Its design was inspired by iconic structures from around the world, including the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, The Sydney Harbour Bridge, and the Eiffel Tower.From base to top, the tower house 13 floors of offices, 10 stories of hotel, five stories of luxury apartments, and additional office space at the top.The East wing of the podium houses the Al-Mamlaka shopping mall, which features more than 150 stores divided across three levels - the first targeted to young people, the second to fashion and furnishings, and the third level is reserved for women. The West wing houses event and entertainment spaces.\n\n\n=== Structure ===\nThe Kingdom Center is built on a four-meter-thick, 3,100-square-meter raft foundation. Its structure consists of two systems: reinforced concrete columns, beams, and core for the first 180 meters, and a tubular steel frame structure for the building\u2018s remaining height.\n\n\n=== Mechanical systems ===\nA multi-part mechanical system was created to accommodate the building's mixed-use program.\nThe tower is cooled by a central chilled water plant, supported by a thermal energy storage system that provides 5,000 tons of cooling capacity. This storage system is used during the hottest hours of the day, allowing the building to shift cool-air production to off-peak hours when electrical demand is lowest.The podium structures are served by separate mechanical systems designed to accommodate the needs of the building's unique programs. Systems used to cool these spaces include variable air volume, constant volume, and fan coils.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAl Faisaliyah Center\nList of tallest buildings in Saudi Arabia\nJeddah Tower\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nOmrania official website\nKingdom Centre at Ellerbe Becket",

          "Very clean and very posh. A large variety of shops in here, including lingerie for the ladies which was a shock to me, but really good to see in Saudi. Lots of meet and greets here and she Skybridge Experience is worth a look, even if it works out as \u00a320 (UK Pounds) per",

          "Visited here recently, apart from the view there is absolutely nothing else the tower/ skywalk has to offer. The attraction could include: Maps of the City Telescopes Guides on hand to pass on information Background music Something to point out what exactly you are",
          "This is the tallest building in Riyadh and can be seen from quite far away. Up close it's just a regular office building, albeit with an interesting design. I didn't go up the top (although it wasn't obvious how to get there even if I'd wanted to). There is a generic mall in the",

          "At 1pm on a Sunday I was the only person here and am so glad I took the time to visit. Accessed from within the shopping centre it\u2019s a cash only transaction to purchase a ticket to the top. Two lifts get you to the top, the first of which is shared with other people heading for",

          "We went there at night for the night view which we found better. It was very limited number of people there so we had a good view. Camera is not allowed to use except phone ( as they hire a pro to take your photo with a fee of cause) it was like 99 story high and took us so",

          "The entrance to the Tower is through the Four Seasons hotel. There is a shopping mall from where you access the Tower. Cost of the experience is 60 SR + VAT (63SR total). It's a two lift trip, you go so far in one lift then transfer to another to access the 99th floor. The Sky",

          "I wanted to see the tower and visit the observation deck. After navigating the construction site that are the streets around it (due to the construction of the Metro), I got there. Spectacular blue color against the clear Riyadh sky. A mall inside. Large and spatious and with",

          "I don\u2019t know where all the people were at 8pm on Wednesday ... may be out in the open barbecuing. But the shopping mall lacked energy. The kingdom tower is an iconic building and it\u2019s a great spectacle. I wish there was more to do indoors.",
          "I like how you can go see the top of the tower and then go shopping or go eat when you go to the rest of the tower. It\u2019s not comparable to obviously the Burj or other large sky scrapers, but it\u2019s definitely worth visiting once. The staff who operate the elevators are super nice.",

          "Good place to visit. Has lots of brand names\u2019 stores. It is a good place to visit, at least once, while in Riyadh. However, not a cultural center. Has a nice, yet not so special, food court. Nice window shopping place. If you have time to kill in Riyadh, then visit. Enjoy...",
          "Their website lists their closing time as 11 pm, with the last elevator going up at 10:30. We arrived at 10:20... to find the entire Skybridge locked up and shut down. One of the guards confirmed the staff had left over a half hour before. So, as is typical for Saudi",
          "We went for a family trip to the Skywalk at Kingdom Tower. 6 adults two children aged 6 and 8. We went at 4.30 on a Thursday afternoon which meant no queues and a fairly empty skywalk so we could move around freely. The views are really fabulous from the skywalk and you forget",

          "It is nice to shop, choice is limited for males. It has not the class of some other high end malls in the same area",
          "Visited this tower today, great experience to go to the top and see breathtaking views of Riyadh, good size mall at the bottom, all 4 floors of it. There is a restaurant at floor 77, where you change lifts to floor 99 for the walkway between the towers. This is definitely worth",
          "If you go to have something to eat or drink in the restaurant, the cost of the sky bridge will be reduced!!",

          "A must see for everyone visiting Riyadh. We had heard the sky deck was so so and expensive but we were blown away. Everything got into perspective when viewing it from this height. I would recommend the daytime to do this. It\u2019s only 65 sar but they only take cash.",
          "On a recommendation we went up to the sky bridge at sunset, unfortunately it was a misty day day so we could see the city but not much else. Tickets cost 60 SAR from the the ticket booth, however we went for a coffee at Spazio\u2019s restaurant on the 77th floor first where you can",
          "Sky bridge at the top of the tower is something worth visiting.The view from there is amazing, you can see the whole Riyadh from there. Recommended to visit during the evening, they charge 60 SAR and Taxes but it's worth for a visit. The first impression of the view is a",

          "It may just be for Riyadh Season, but at 9pm one Friday evening, timed to co-ordinate with the Riyadh Boulevard which can be seen in the North East, fireworks are let off from the tower. Either visit the skywalk or have dinner in Spazio Italian restaurant.",
          "You can enjoy eating in different restaurants and enjoy a luxurious shopping \ud83d\udecd in the mall , and if you are board you can watch a movie \ud83c\udfa5 in the cinema.",

          "Quite an experience. Best to go on a clear day! Get a full view of the city landscape. At night the tower is lit up, and you can see it for miles! Enjoy. It's Worth the trip!",

          "Being 100 floors up to see the skyline is a cool thing. The Mall is great for shopping and other interesting things to look for and experience the culture. The cost of going up to see the skyline is around $20. I think its better at night once you see the lights in the city.",
          "Nice view of the city. You have to pay 63SR for entrance and if you want a photo taken by the staff it cost 20SR per copy. Go there around 4-5 pm to see the view on daylight and wait for nightfall which shows a lot of fantastic lights.",

          "The Skybridge is not worth the price of admission. About five years ago, it was only SR20; now it has gone up to SR60. There's nothing much to see at the top of the tower. The view is comparable to the one you're seeing when you're on a plane that's about to land. The mall is",

          "The views from the tower were quite impressive, but I am not sure it was worth the cost of entrance. They did allow you to stay on the SkyBridge for as long as you liked The shopping centre was amazing every shop and brand you can imagine almost Very worth the visit",

        "wiki": "Wadi Hanifa (Arabic: \u0648\u064e\u0627\u062f\u0650\u064a \u062d\u064e\u0646\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0629\u200e, romanized: W\u0101d\u012b \u1e24an\u012bfah) is a wadi (valley) in the Najd region, Riyadh Province, in central Saudi Arabia. The valley runs for a length of 120 km (75 mi) from northwest to southeast, cutting through the city of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. A string of towns and villages lie along the valley, including Uyaynah, Irqah and Diriyah. The historical city of Riyadh itself is on the northeastern side of the wadi, but the city has now expanded across Wadi Hanifa, with the sub-municipalities of Al-Shifa and Al-Urayja on its southwestern side.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn ancient times, the wadi was known as al-Irdh (\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0636). Its current name is derived from that of the Banu Hanifa, the principal Arab tribe in the area at the time of the Islamic conquest of Arabia.\nIn pre-historic times, rain fell heavily in the region. This is reflected in the local folk tradition that claims that during the reign of the ancient kingdom of Al-Yamamah, the area was once covered with oases and fertile farmland. God became angry and visited a plague of locusts and drought that the land never recovered from. Modern climate studies would likely show that the local catastrophe was actually the effect of global climate changes. Ongoing and future changes could bring higher precipitation levels back to the region.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nTemperatures in summer reach an average of 42.9 \u00b0C (109.2 \u00b0F), and precipitation averages only 60 millimetres (2.4 in) per year in the driest places. Rain falls with great intensity for short periods, causing flash floods. The nature of the dry, warm climate leads to a high percentage of the scarce rainfall being instantly evaporated. That which remains mostly ends up as groundwater. While abundant, the levels of the water table are being tested by the rapid growth the city of Riyadh has seen in the past fifty years, from a population of 150,000 in 1960 to an estimated 5 million today.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nWhile the wadi has traditionally been dry except for during times of flooding, the construction of Riyadh's first large sewage treatment facility in 1982 has channelled 400,000\u2013650,000 m3 (14,000,000\u201323,000,000 cubic feet) of runoff downstream daily, creating a constantly expanding area of small lakes south of Riyadh. A new green corridor nearly 100 kilometers long has been formed. The Saudi government and the Ar-Riyad Development Authority appointed Buro Happold and Moriyama & Teshima architects  to plan the preservation of the wetlands of the Wadi Hanifa, as they had become a popular destination for recreational activities such as fishing and picnicking and have also become a stop for migratory birds. The government has invested over $100 million (US) into an environmental rehabilitation project. This includes the construction of dams to regulate water flow, new limits on land use such as the banning of such commercial activities as quarrying and the planting of reeds to further purify the treated and untreated sewage. The completed project won the 2010 Aga Khan Award for Architecture. The increase in surface water has led to widespread date palm cultivation along the banks of the wadi. The treated water is given free of charge from the government to farmers which has led to much higher yields. More importantly for the economy, the government uses much of the water to run one of the largest oil refineries in the country. The city of Riyadh also pumps a portion back into the city to irrigate its public gardens and parks.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTuwaiq\nManfuha\nAl-Hayir\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Wadi Hanifa at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n== References ==\n\nal-Asad, Mohammad & Yildirum Yavuz.

        "wiki": "The Murabba Palace (Qasr al Murabba (the Square in Arabic)) is one of the historic buildings in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The palace was named after its square with the form of 400 by 400 metres (1,300 by 1,300 ft). It is one of the museums in the city.\n\n\n== History and location ==\nThe palace was built by King Abdulaziz outside Riyadh, being the first major expansion of the city in the twentieth century. Construction was started in 1936, partly finalized in 1938 and fully completed in 1945. The palace was intended to be a family residence and court for the king. With the construction of the palace three novel technologies were introduced to the Saudi society: the use of the automobiles as means of transportation, electricity by means of generators and water closets with drainage systems.The king left his former court in Masmak fort when the construction was finished, and used the palace as his residence and court from 1938 until his death in 1953. One of his wives, Hussa bint Ahmed Al Sudairi, also moved with him to the palace in 1938. Another palace, Addeera, was also used as royal residence.During this period Murabba Palace witnessed many official visits and sign of various agreements. A lift was installed into the Murabba Palace in the late 1940s when the king had difficulty in climbing the stairs due to advanced arthritis. It was the first lift in Saudi Arabia. The king appointed one of his sons, Prince Mansour, as emir of the palace.The Murabba palace is situated two kilometers north of the old city of Riyadh, and its total area was over 16 hectares. It is located about half a mile from Masmak fort. The area where the palace was constructed was called Murabba Al Sufyan. In the south of the palace there are gardens, and the Batha valley is situated in the east. Wadi Abu Rafie is in the west, and small hills lie on the north of the palace.Murabba Palace is very close to Al Shamsia mansion which was the residence of Saud Al Kabeer and his wife Noura bint Abdul Rahman, elder sister of King Abdulaziz.\n\n\n== Layout and style ==\nThe palace is a complex of palaces used for different purposes, housing two stories with 32 rooms. Overall shape of the building is cubic. It is made up of residential buildings, service facilities and the diwan of the king. These buildings are surrounded by a courtyard. A huge brick wall also surrounds the palace, and there are nine gates. The main gate was originally on the west side, but, later the gate on the southern side was used as main entrance which allowed a short link to the nearby mosque.The upper floor of the building used for court of the king included audience hall, offices of administrative affairs, communications and guest chambers. The ground floor housed the offices for palace utilities, security and administration.It has a plain style and reflects the general features of the traditional Najdi architecture. The building also reflects the general characteristics of Najd's urban pattern, namely solid masses, covered streets, and the integration of courtyards. The palace was built mainly by bricks, indigenous stones, tamarisk trunk and palm-leaf stalks. The walls of the building were made by straw reinforced adobe, and have engraved ornaments on coating. Local Acacia with palm frond matts was used for the ceiling of the palace. The wood beams supporting the ceiling have decorations with yellow, red, and black geometric patterns.\n\n\n== Current usage ==\nA development project was initiated by the Supreme Commission of Tourism and Antiquities in 1999 to renovate the Murabba palace. It was converted into a museum that is open to public visits. It was called \"living museum\" after renovation. It is part of the King Abdulaziz Darat or King Abdulaziz Historical Center.In the current usage, the ground floor includes the guards' room and stores for food, coffee, wood and other materials needed for cooking. The upper floor is made up of salons and waiting rooms for visitors. There several historic garments and crafts are exhibited. There is also the King Abdulaziz memorial hall and a written and photographic archive centre in the building.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPictures of Murabba Palace and garden",

His reign saw both huge developments in the country due to increase in oil revenues and significant events in the Middle East.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nKhalid was born in Riyadh on 13 February 1913. He was the fifth son of Ibn Saud. His mother, Al Jawhara bint Musaed Al Jiluwi, was from the important Al Jiluwi clan whose members intermarried with Al Sauds.Khalid had one full-brother, Prince Muhammad. His full sister, Al Anoud, married to the sons of Sa'ad bin Abdul Rahman. She first married Saud bin Saad. After Saud died, she married Fahd bin Saad.Khalid attended the Mufirej school founded by Sheikh Abdul Rahman Al Mufirej in 1879 which was based in the Sheikh Abdullah bin Abdul Latif mosque in the Dukhna neighborhood. There he acquired basic literacy skills and studied arithmetics.\n\n\n== Early experience ==\n\nAged 14, Khalid bin Abdulaziz was sent by Ibn Saud as his representative to the desert tribes to hear their concerns and problems. Prince Khalid's preparation for ruling a modern state started through his visits with Prince Faisal on foreign missions, representing Saudi Arabia at the United Nations. Prince Khalid served as advisor of him. Prince Khalid became an international figure as a result of his visits and service as Saudi representative. He was more liberal in informing the press about the rationale behind foreign policy decisions.In 1932, Prince Khalid was named as viceroy of the Hejaz, replacing Prince Faisal in the post, who was named minister of foreign affairs. Prince Khalid's term as viceroy of Hejaz lasted until 1934. Prince Khalid joined the Saudi army led by his older brother Prince Faisal and fought against Yemeni forces in 1934. After the war, Prince Khalid served as the chairman of the Saudi delegation at the Taif Conference with Yemen in 1934. This was a diplomatic move that led to the Taif Treaty later that year which was signed by Prince Khalid on behalf of Saudi Arabia and Abdullah al Wazeer on behalf of Yemen.Prince Khalid was named interior minister in 1934 and was the Saudi representative at the peace negotiations in Yemen in 1935. In 1939, he participated in the St. James Conference on Palestine in London as the minister of interior as well as an assistant to Prince Faisal, head of the Saudi delegation.In October 1943 Prince Faisal and Prince Khalid visited the United States upon the July 1943 invitation of President Roosevelt representing their fathers officially. The visit was the earliest high-level contacts between Saudi Arabia and the USA. Vice President Henry A. Wallace organized a dinner for them at the White House. They also met with Roosevelt. They stayed at the official government guest house, Blair House, during their visit and visited the West Coast by a special train that was officially provided by the US government. A foreign diplomat described Prince Khalid following the visit as \"probably nicest man in Saudi Arabia.\"At the end of October 1962 Prince Khalid was appointed deputy prime minister in the new cabinet formed by Prince Faisal, indicating his prominence in the line of succession. During the rivalry between King Saud and Prince Faisal, Prince Khalid supported the latter together with other princes who were members of Al Jiluwi branch of Al Saud through maternal lineage or marriage. The group was led by Prince Mohammed, Prince Khalid and Prince Abdullah, who had married a woman from Al Jiluwi clan.\n\n\n== Crown prince ==\nKhalid's older full-brother Prince Muhammad declined a place in the succession. Khalid also refused the offer of King Faisal to be named as Crown Prince several times until March 1965. However, he was named Crown Prince on 29 March 1965 to succeed King Faisal which was announced by King Faisal on the same day through a broadcast over Mecca Radio:Since the position of Crown Prince is a fundamental factor for the continuation and firmness\nof the reign, now the country enjoys stability, advancement and prosperity. Thanks to its adherence to Islam. It gives me great pleasure to announce...that I have chosen my brother Prince Khalid bin Abdulaziz as Crown Prince to rule after me.\nPrince Khalid was also appointed first deputy prime minister. His main task was to govern all organisational and executive powers of the Council of Ministers. He also dealt with the affairs of the Governorate of Mecca on behalf of King Faisal. Crown Prince Khalid was not active in daily issues, but acted as a representative during King Faisal's absences in meetings or ceremonies. According to the declassified US diplomatic documents of 1971, he enjoyed the support of the tribal chiefs, religious authorities and of Prince Abdullah, head of the National Guard, during this period. However, he asked King Faisal to remove him from the position various times. His request was not accepted by the King who persuaded him about the fact that his presence as crown prince was necessary to keep peace within the House of Saud.One of the speculations about Prince Khalid's selection as heir designate was his lack of predilection for politics. In short, by selecting him as heir designate the royal family could create intra-familial consensus.\n\n\n== Reign ==\nKhalid succeeded to the throne on 25 March 1975 when King Faisal was assassinated. He was proclaimed king after a meeting of senior members of Al Saud: his uncle Prince Abdullah bin Abdul Rahman and his elder brothers Prince Mohammed, Prince Nasser, Prince Saad and younger brothers Prince Fahd and Prince Abdullah. The meeting occurred just hours after the assassination of King Faisal. King Khalid also became the de facto prime minister of Saudi Arabia.Although there are various reports stating that King Khalid was only a figurehead during his reign, he was in fact not a figurehead, but the final decision-maker on all major policy issues during his reign. Because King Faisal established a system in which the king was the final mediator in family problems. For instance, King Khalid clearly reduced Sudairi Seven's power concerning succession in 1977 when he was in London for treatment. Because he asked Crown Prince Fahd and Prince Abdullah to fully obey the existing succession plan without any change. The reason for King Khalid's request was the frequent rumors about Prince Sultan's intention to become crown prince instead of Prince Abdullah when King Khalid died.On the other hand, King Khalid was not an ineffective leader. Although he seemed to be reluctant to rule the country initially, he later warmed to the throne and displayed an apparent interest in improving the education, health-care and infrastructure of the country during his seven-year reign. In fact, during the first two years of his reign he was not active due to his poor health condition. However, later he became much more active in politics as a result of his much better health.King Khalid is also considered to have been a genial caretaker during his reign. However, he failed to monopolize the power during his reign, leading to the empowerment of the princes who had been in powerful posts in late King Faisal's reign. He had some personal characteristics that made him a respected king. He was admired as an honest man who managed to have good relations with the traditional establishment of Saudi Arabia. Therefore, he was granted support by other princes and powerful forces of the country. Ghadah Alghunaim, a board member of the King Abdulaziz Center for National Dialogue, argues in her doctoral dissertation that his reign is known as the Saudi golden era and the era of goodness.\n\n\n=== Domestic affairs ===\nKing Khalid's reign was of massive development in Saudi Arabia and therefore, the country became one of the richest countries. He primarily dealt with domestic affairs with special focus on agricultural development. The industrial cities of Jubail and Yanbu (now huge complexes) were created in his reign. However, Simon Henderson argues that his period was, as can be expected, undynamic. On the other hand, the number of schools increased during his reign. In 1975, there were 3,028 elementary schools, 649 secondary schools and 182 high schools. In 1980, there were 5,373 elementary, 1,377 secondary and 456 high schools. The other significant development in the field of education during his reign was the establishment of King Faisal University. The others were the Higher Education Center for Women which was opened in 1976 as well as colleges of medicine and pharmacology established specifically for female students.Immediately following his ascension to the throne King Khalid issued a general amnesty which allowed the release of political prisoners who had been members of the left wing movements and the return of those who had been in exile to Saudi Arabia.In terms of administrative functions King Khalid followed the structure established by late King Faisal in which both royals and nonroyals occupied significant positions. In fact, King Khalid expanded the role of nonroyals in bureaucracy without diminishing the roles of royal family members.The strict financial policies of late King Faisal, coupled with the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis, created a financial windfall that fueled development and led to a commercial and economic boom in the country. Notable achievements in his reign included the institution of the second \"Five-Year Plan\" in 1975, which aimed to build up Saudi infrastructure and health care. The planned budget for the development plan was $142 billion. Although not all goals were achieved, the second development plan was much more successful than the first one. King Khalid also launched the Kingdom's third development plan with the planned budget of $250 billion in May 1980.The political power consolidation of the ruling family was intensified during his reign. In a reorganization of the council of ministers on 30 March 1975, King Khalid named then-crown prince Fahd deputy prime minister and Prince Abdullah second deputy prime minister. Appointment of Prince Fahd as both crown prince and first deputy prime minister made him much powerful figure in contrast to the status of King Khaled when he was crown prince under King Faisal reign. Prince Nayef was named minister of interior succeeding Prince Fahd on 30 March 1975. King Khalid also appointed Prince Saud as the foreign affairs minister in March 1975. Prince Mohammad, elder brother of King Khalid, was one of his key advisors. In fact, they acted together on almost all political issues. Maarouf al-Dawalibi, former Prime Minister of Syria as well as the founder of the Islamic Socialist Front, was also among the advisors of King Khalid.In addition to the existing ministerial bodies six new ones were established by King Khalid. One of them was the ministry of municipal and rural affairs established in October 1975, and Prince Majid was appointed minister. Additionally, Prince Mutaib was appointed minister of public works and housing that was also established by King Khalid in October 1975. These two appointments were a move to reduce the power of Sudairi Seven in the cabinet. Additionally, the ministry of industry and electricity, the ministry of higher education, the ministry of post, telegraph, and telephone and the ministry of planning were all founded by King Khalid. In the same government reshuffle he removed Prince Musaid, his uncle, from the post of finance minister which he had been held since 16 March 1962, and Mohammed bin Ali Aba Khail was made new finance minister.Kemal Adham served as the president of Al Mukhabarat Al A'amah or the general intelligence directorate until 1979 which he had held since 1965. Adham's successor in the post was Turki bin Faisal. Another administrative unit established by King Khalid in 1975 was the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu of which the first secretary general was Abdullah bin Faisal bin Turki. Saudi Arabia acquired full control of Aramco in 1980 during his reign. The same year King Khalid established a constitutional committee with eight members under the presidency of Prince Nayef.The reign of King Khalid witnessed at least two major local incidents which have significant effects on the politics of Saudi Arabia: Grand Mosque seizure and Shiite uprising both of which occurred in 1979.\n\n\n==== Grand Mosque seizure ====\nSome foreign observers thought traditionalism was no longer a strong force in Saudi Arabia. This idea was disproved when at least 500 dissidents invaded and seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca on 20 November 1979. When the first news of the attack in Mecca reached Riyadh, the initial reaction of King Khalid was to consult the ulama, in order to get permission to use military force to eject the attackers. The ulama hesitated and refrained from a definite answer. Only after the assault had been underway for 36 hours did some ulama allow the use of force. At the time of the event, Crown Prince Fahd was in Tunisia for a meeting of the Arab Summit and then commander of National Guard Prince Abdullah was in Morocco for an official visit. Therefore, King Khalid assigned the responsibility to Prince Sultan, then minister of defense and Prince Nayef, then minister of interior, to deal with the incident.The Grand Mosque was regained by Saudi forces on 4 December 1979 and 63 rebels were executed on 9 January 1980 in eight different cities. The executions were decreed by King Khalid after the edict issued by ulemas. Although the Saudi government under King Khalid executed the rebels, the religious establishment that inspired them were given greater powers. And ulema successfully pressed King Khalid to realize their intentions.\n\n\n==== 1979 Qatif Uprising ====\nIn November 1979 the Shiite minority in the Eastern Province, particularly in Qatif and in nearby villages, organized protests and several demonstrators were arrested. The major reason for the uprising was negative conditions in villages. In the spring of 1979 King Khalid announced an annual budget of 160 billion Saudi Riyal indicating that this budget would be employed to improve the living conditions of all Saudi citizens. However, the budget did not make any significant contribution to the services for citizens. Instead, the members of the Saudi royal family benefitted from the budget. Following the release of the demonstrators in February 1980, King Khalid and Crown Prince Fahd visited the Eastern region from town to town. Due to King Khalid's policy change towards Shiite population in the region they also positively modified their approach towards the Saudi government and abandoned their oppositional ideas and actions.\n\n\n=== International relations ===\n\nAlthough King Khalid did not have an extensive interest in foreign affairs as much as King Faisal had, his reign witnessed many important international events, including the Iranian Revolution, the assassination of Anwar Sadat and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, all of which had significant effects for Saudi Arabia. In addition, the Saudi government led by King Khalid was much more active in improving the relations of Saudi Arabia with neighbouring states in contrast to the reign of Faisal. Kamal Adham was King Khalid's key counsellor on foreign policy during his reign from 1975 to 1982.King Khalid initiated the move to bring in foreign labor to help with the country's development.\n\n\n==== Major events (1975\u22121980) ====\nIn April 1975, his first diplomatic coup was the conclusion of a demarcation agreement concerning the Al Buraymi Oasis, where the frontiers of Abu Dhabi, Oman and Saudi Arabia meet. Claims and counterclaims over this frontier had exacerbated relations among them for years. Therefore, King Khalid aimed at settling this long-standing boundary disputes. The conclusion of negotiations under King Khalid added to his stature as a statesman. Another significant event was the visit of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran to Riyadh in late April 1975. In June 1975 Saudi Arabia appointed an ambassador to the United Arab Emirates which also assigned an ambassador to Saudi Arabia the same date.His first official visit as the King of Saudi Arabia was to Cairo, Egypt, in mid-July 1975. The visit was an indication of Saudi Arabia's support of the initiatives of Anwar Sadat concerning peace settlement between the Arabs and Israel. King Khalid visited Damascus in December 1975 and met with then-Syrian President Hafez Assad to discuss the ways to support Muslims in Lebanon that began to experience civil war. He declared the Saudi Arabia's support to Syria's role in the war.Diplomatic relations with the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen were reestablished in March 1976. A month later, in April 1976, King Khalid made state visits to all of the Gulf states in the hope of promoting closer relations with his peninsular neighbors. He also called numerous summits and inaugurated the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 1981 that is seen an outcome of his early visits. Then GCC was established along with Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.One of the significant international moves occurred in the reign of King Khalid was the establishment of the Safari Club of which the treaty was signed on 1 September 1976. It was a secret organization with the participation of Egypt, France, Iran, Morocco and Saudi Arabia to eliminate the potential influence of communism in the region. The treaty was signed by Kamal Adham on behalf of Saudi Arabia. King Khalid organized a conference in Riyadh in October 1976 to resolve the ongoing Lebanese civil war, and the conference contributed to end the war.On 19 May 1977 King Khalid met Syrian President Hafez Assad and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in Riyadh to initiate a coordinated policy on Arab-Israeli conflict. King Khalid and Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto met in Riyadh on 18 June 1977. Lebanese Foreign Minister Fuad Butrus was received by King Khalid in Riyadh on 5 July 1977 to discuss current situation in Lebanon. On 10 July 1977 Yen Chia-kan, President of Taiwan, visited Saudi Arabia and was received by the King in Riyadh. Two days later, on 12 July 1977, King Khalid and Somali President Mohamed Siad Barre met in Jeddah. Sudanese President Jaafar Nimeiry and King Khalid met in Ta'if on 2 August 1977.In early January 1978 US President Jimmy Carter paid an official visit to Riyadh and met King Khalid to discuss the Middle East peace efforts. Following King Khalid's heart surgery at the Cleveland Clinic on 3 October 1978 Jimmy Carter invited him to the White House for lunch, and they met on 27 October. The Camp David accord which was signed by Egypt and Israel in September 1978 severely affected the Saudi-Egyptian alliance, and Saudi Arabia's diplomatic relations with Egypt were terminated following the Baghdad Conference in November 1978.Following the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, King Khalid sent Khomeini a congratulatory message, stating that Islamic solidarity could be the basis for closer relations of two countries. He also argued that with the foundation of the Islamic Republic in Iran there were no obstacles that inhibited the cooperation between two countries. In addition,\nKing Khalid requested the secretary-general of the Organization of the Islamic Conference to congratulate the new Iranian government. However, his initiatives were unsuccessful in that Saudi Arabia unofficially supported Iraq against Iran in the Iran\u2013Iraq War in 1980.\n\n\n==== Major events (1980\u22121982) ====\nIn April 1980 King Khalid cancelled the state visit to Britain as a protest over the broadcasting of Death of a Princess on 9 April 1980 in the United Kingdom that narrated the execution of Misha'al bin Fahd, the granddaughter of Prince Mohammad bin Abdulaziz. King Khalid had been invited by Queen Elizabeth II in June 1979, following the Queen's visit to Saudi Arabia in February 1979, during which King Khalid gave her a diamond necklace. In addition, the British ambassador was expelled from Saudi Arabia for five months due to the broadcasting of the documentary on ITV. Egyptian actress Suzan Abu Talib or Sawsan Badr and other actors who had roles in the documentary were banned from entering Saudi Arabia.King Khalid's visit to the United Kingdom that had been cancelled in 1980 was realized on 9 June 1981 for four days. Upon meeting then-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in Saudi Arabia in April 1981, King Khalid is reputed to have said he would be happy to discuss falcons with her, but for all matters of administration she should talk to Crown Prince Fahd.King Khalid asked then-U.S. president Carter to sell advanced fighter planes to Saudi Arabia to assist in countering communist aggression in the area. The delivery of the first of sixty F-15s under the agreement approved by Carter arrived in the Kingdom in 1982. He purchased a Boeing 747 with an operating room should he be stricken while on his travels. Jimmy Carter in his memoirs stated that both King Khalid and then Crown Prince Fahd assured him of \"their unequivocal support for Sadat\", but they would realize no concrete move in this direction, at least not publicly.\n\n\n== Views ==\nAt the very beginning of his reign King Khalid stated \"Islamic law is and will remain our standard, our source of inspiration, and our goal.\" He questioned the support of the US administration to Greece instead of Turkey in late May 1976 citing Turkey's contributions in the Korean War during the 1950s. In an interview on BBC Summary of World Broadcasts he expressed the following views on Zionism, communism and colonialism on 3 July 1979: We regard Zionism, communism and colonialism as a trinity allied against Arab and Islamic rights and aspirations. Our policy is based on that understanding, and it is natural for us to be always subjected to biased and poisonous campaigns at the hand of that very trinity. At the third summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Taif in January 1981 he declared non-alignment of Saudi Arabia concerning the tensions between the USA and Soviet Union: Our loyalty must be neither to an eastern bloc nor to a western bloc. The security of the Islamic nation will not be assured by joining a military alliance, nor by taking refuge under the umbrella of a superpower.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nKing Khalid married four times and was the father of ten children. While the sequence in seniority of his wives is not known clearly, his wives were:\n\nLatifa bint Ahmed Al Sudairi. Latifa was a daughter of King Abdulaziz's maternal uncle and Khalid was fifteen when he married her. They had no child.\nTarfa bint Abdullah bin Abdul Rahman Al Saud. She was a daughter of his uncle, Abdullah bin Abdul Rahman. They had no child.\nNoura bint Turki bin Abdulaziz bin Abdullah bin Turki Al Saud. She was the granddaughter of Abdullah bin Jiluwi and was the mother of Khalid's elder sons, Prince Bandar and Prince Abdullah. Noura bint Turki died at age 95 on 12 September 2011.\nSita bint Fahd Al Damir had seven children with King Khalid: Jawhara, Nouf, Moudi, Hussa, Al Bandari, Mishaal, and Faisal. She was from the Ujman tribe in Al Badiyah and was a niece of Wasmiyah Al Damir, wife of Abdullah bin Jiluwi. She died on 25 December 2012 at the age of 90.Khalid had four sons and six daughters. Prince Bandar, the eldest son of King Khalid, was born in 1935. He was one of the members of Al Saud Family Council established by Crown Prince Abdullah in June 2000 to discuss private issues such as business activities of princes and marriages of princess to individuals who were not member of House of Saud. Prince Bandar died in Mecca in March 2018. His youngest child, Prince Faisal, is the former governor of Asir Province and a member of the Allegiance Council. \nOne of his daughters, Hussa bint Khalid, married Abdullah bin Faisal bin Turki, grandson of Turki I. She died at the age of 59 in November 2010. Another daughter, Moudi, wife of late Prince Abdul Rahman bin Faisal, is the general secretary of the King Khalid Foundation and the Al Nahda Foundation, and a former member of the Consultative Assembly. Al Bandari bint Khalid married to Badr bin Abdul Muhsin Al Saud.King Khalid owned a desert farm outside Riyadh at Um Hamam. In December 1975 he bought the then longest Cadillac at 25 feet and 2 inches long. He bought Beechwood House in the north London suburb of Highgate for \u00a31.9 million in March 1977.\n\n\n=== Personality and pastimes ===\nKhalid was described as warm, cheerful, attentive and devout and was adored by his sisters and brothers. An American journalist from Christian Science Monitor, John K. Cooley, following his observation of King Khalid at majlis stated that he carefully listened to his subjects showing his sense of humor and amused smile. During the first year of his rule King Khalid was said by his close observers to be an open and good man without any pretense representing the best example of Arab gentlemanly culture. His favourite topics to discuss at majlis with visitors were the problems related to education and youth.Khalid had the capacity to settle the conflicts which was first recognized by his father. It was the reason for sending him to Yemen in 1935 to handle the problems with local people. During his kingship Khalid acted as a mediator between Sudairi brothers and Prince Abdullah although he was much closer to the latter.Falconry and horse-riding were Khalid's favorite pastimes, He was described as a man of the desert. He had one of the best falcon collections. In the late 1970s, King Khalid was given a rare Alberta-trained gyrfalcon by the Canadian government as a gift. Hunting was also one of his favorites, and he went to African countries to participate in hunting safaris when he was young. Khalid bought the first Toyota Landcruiser in 1955 for falconry.\n\n\n=== Health ===\nWhen Khalid bin Abdulaziz was crown prince, he had a massive heart attack in 1970 and had a heart surgery in 1972 at the Cleveland Clinic in the United States. Since King Khalid suffered from heart ailment for a long period of time, then Crown Prince Fahd was in charge of ruling the country. On 3 October 1978, he underwent a second heart surgery again in Cleveland. He also had a hip operation at Wellington Hospital in London in 1976. In February 1980, King Khalid had a minor heart attack.\n\n\n== Death and funeral ==\nKing Khalid died on 13 June 1982 due to a heart attack in Taif. On the same day his body was brought from Taif to Mecca. After funeral prayers at the Grand Mosque in Mecca, King Khalid was buried in Al Oud cemetery in Riyadh. Leaders of Qatar, Kuwait, Djibouti, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, as well as then-President of Egypt Hosni Mubarak, participated in the funeral.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nKing Khalid International Airport, King Khalid University, King Khalid Eye Specialist Hospital in Riyadh, King Khalid Military City and King Khalid Medical City in the Eastern province were all named after him. In Riyadh there is also a mosque named after him, King Khalid Mosque, serving the Moslems since 1988. In Jeddah a bridge is named after King Khalid. There is a research center on wildlife in Saudi Arabia named after him, namely Khalid Wildlife Research Centre.In addition, his family established King Khalid Foundation, which is being headed by his son, Abdullah bin Khalid. The foundation awards individuals who have achievements in the fields of corporate social responsibility, nonprofit management and social innovation.\n\n\n=== Awards ===\nIn January 1981, King Khalid was awarded by the United Nations (UN) a gold medal. This medal is the UN's highest decoration for the statesmen who significantly contributed to peace and cooperation worldwide. King Khalid also received the King Faisal International Prize for Service to Islam due to his efforts in support of Islamic solidarity in 1981.\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== Foreign honours ===\n Malaysia: Honorary Recipient of the Order of the Crown of the Realm (January 1982)\n Spain: Grand Cross of the Order of Civil Merit (15 February 1974)\n Spain: Collar of the Order of Charles III (15 June 1981)\n Sweden: Knight of the Royal Order of the Seraphim (20 January 1981)\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of things named after Saudi Kings\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "wiki": "al-Khobar (Arabic: \u0671\u0644\u0652\u062e\u064f\u0628\u064e\u0631\u200e, romanized: al-Khubar) is a city and governorate in the Eastern Province of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, situated on the coast of the Persian Gulf. It ranks 19th by population overall in the kingdom, behind Yanbu' and ahead of Arar, with an estimated population of 165,799 as of 2020. Khobar is part of the 'Triplet Cities' area, or Dammam metropolitan area along with Dammam and Dhahran, forming the residential core of the region. \nThe city was founded alongside Dammam by the Dawasir who moved there in 1923 fearing British persecution with the permission of King Abdulaziz Al Saud. Khobar experienced rapid growth during and after the discovery of oil in Saudi Arabia as it served as the port for the oil exports of Saudi Aramco in the company's early days. Traditionally, Khobar has also been a city of shopkeepers and merchants, and today has several shopping malls in and around it.  \nThe city is the newest in the Dammam metropolitan area, facing the Persian Gulf with its 16-km long Corniche Road, which runs parallel to the city's eastern coast. Khobar is also considered a resort town as its southern suburbs of the city face the Half Moon Bay and host several beaches and beach resorts. By night, the quiet city turns into a bustling one, with some of the largest malls in the kingdom, such as the Mall of Dhahran and the al-Rashid Mall. The city is also home to the historic Suwaiket Street, officially known as the Prince Bandar ibn Abdulaziz Street, which is home to some of the oldest markets in the city.  \nThe Khobar governorate is further divided into several municipalities, with Khobar as their capital. 'Issam ibn Abdullatif al-Mulla has been serving as the mayor of the governorate from the Islamic year 1428 AH.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the early 1930s, Khobar was mainly a fishing hamlet inhabited by members of the Dawasir tribe, who moved there in 1923, fearing British persecution with the permission of King Abdulaziz. The city shares a similar history with Dammam. The tribe settled in Khobar for its proximity to Bahrain as they had hoped to return to their homeland. The Khobar Governorate was incorporated in 1942 and with the discovery of oil in nearby areas, a port was built in the southern parts of the modern city to facilitate the export of petroleum to Bahrain.\nThe city quickly transformed into a residential hub and a commercial and industrial port. It soon lost these privileges as commercial operations were transferred to the King Abdulaziz Port in Dammam and the petroleum exports were transferred to Ra's Tanura. As a result, Khobar retained its status as the residential core of the area, but over time, its streets slowly became densely packed with markets Its northern waterfront along the Persian Gulf has been transformed into a corniche with parks and eateries, with beaches and resorts to the south on Half Moon Bay.\nWhile most of Khobar's districts are built upon the grid system, unlike Dammam, most of the buildings in the city's main districts are a mix of commercial and residential complexes, with masjids of varied designs and colours adorning its many streets.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nKhobar has a desert climate (BWh), like the majority of the Saudi Arabian desert under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification; with very hot, dry summers and mild to warm, dry winters. Light rain with frequent heavy spells and thunderstorms is common during winters and spring; with small episodes of hail taking place during the winters. Much like Dammam, Khobar also experiences the urban heat island effect.\nThe average annual temperature is 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F) during the day and 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F) at night. January is the coldest month with temperatures ranging from 12 to 22 \u00b0C (54 to 72 \u00b0F) during the day to 3 to 18 \u00b0C (37 to 64 \u00b0F) at night. In the warmest month, June, the typical temperature ranges from 36 to 50 \u00b0C (97 to 122 \u00b0F) during the day to about 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F) at night. Generally, summer lasts about six months, from May to October. Two months, April and November, are transitional, but the transition between seasons is rather quick. Large fluctuations in temperature are rare, particularly in the summer months.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nKhobar is the only city in Saudi Arabia in which foreign residents constitute the majority of its population, making up more than 56% of its population. Most of the expatriates in the region are from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Philippines.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\nKhobar is served by the largest airport in the world in terms of surface area: King Fahd International Airport. The airport plot is about 77,600 hectares (776 square kilometers) in area, which is slightly bigger than the country of Bahrain. and it is located 20 km northwest of Dammam. From Khobar, the terminal is approximately 50 km (31 mi) away. Some residents prefer using the Bahrain International Airport too.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nKhobar is connected with the major highways in the region including the Dhahran\u2013Jubail Expressway, Highway 95 and Highway 605 (also known as the Khobar\u2013Dammam Highway) which links Khobar directly to the King Fahd International Airport via the heart of Dammam. Khobar hosts the King Fahd Causeway, which links Saudi Arabia to Bahrain. Khobar is also connected to highways to other Middle-Eastern countries such as Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\n=== Sea ===\nWhile the historic port of Khobar was destroyed, a new port is being constructed south of Khobar's South Corniche and is expected to handle civilian port activities.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nThe nearest railway station to Khobar is the Dammam railway station, which offers connections via its 449 km Dammam\u2013Riyadh line to Abqaiq, Hofuf and Riyadh.\n\n\n== Human resources ==\nKhobar is a city with multiple lifestyle centers and shopping malls, The city also has the Corniche which is lined with several international and local chain restaurants, coffee shops, and boutiques of all kinds. People from the neighboring GCC states and from the rest of the country visit the city to do activities such as fishing, scuba diving, water sports, and shopping.\n\n\n=== Hospitals ===\nKhobar hosts several government-funded public and private hospitals including AGH Khobar, Mohammad Dossary Hospital (MDH), King Fahd University Hospital (KFUH), and the Dr. Sulaiman Al Habib Medical Complex. \n\n\n=== Education ===\nThe first school in Khobar was established in 1942. \n\n\n==== Primary and secondary education ====\nToday, Khobar is home to more than 100 public and private educational institutes. Indian schools affiliated with the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) are the most common forms of international schools with countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh also operating their own schools with their own curricula. Private American and British educational institutes are also present.\n\n\n==== Higher education ====\nKing Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals and Prince Mohammad bin Fahd University are two universities that are located within or close to Khobar. Students may also go to other universities in the city of Dammam.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Natural landmarks ===\nBeing a residential area, Khobar is famous for its many recreational parks which are decorated with different monuments including Prince Ibn Jalawy Park, Eskan Park. \n\n\n=== Arts and architecture ===\n\nIn March 2019, the Sharqiah Season, part of the Saudi Seasons initiative, attracted an estimated 730,000 visitors to multiple cities in the Eastern Province including Khobar under the supervision of the General Authority for Entertainment, with 83 events held across 17 days in 9 cities, celebrating the country's diverse culture, Most notable of the events that took place in Khobar was the Bollywood Festival, designed to attract the city's expatriate majority, featuring Salman Khan. Other artists who participated in the Khobar events of the Sharqiah Season include Ti\u00ebsto and Sean Paul.\nThe Khobar Corniche is a 16-km stretch of parks and a corniche running parallel to the eastern coast of the city along the Persian Gulf and hosting some of the cities most famous attractions. It has been divided into two parts, the South Corniche and the North Corniche. The King Fahd Causeway is a series of causeways and bridges between Saudi Arabia and the Kingdom of Bahrain. The bridge is about 25 kilometers long from the Saudi toll plaza to the Bahraini toll plaza, and 23.2 meters wide. It was officially opened on 25 November 1986 and is named after King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. The bridge has a maximum capacity of 28,000 cars and 1000 trucks. It has achieved many economic and social benefits for both countries.The Khobar Water Tower is situated on a man-made peninsula in the northern reaches of the Khobar Corniche. The Khobar Water Tower is a 90 meter tall, eight-story tower, with a revolving restaurant on the top, overlooking the city. It has been called the Eastern Province's \"top tourist attraction\". The tower hosts fireworks shows on special occasions such as the arrival of Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. The Prince Sultan Science & Technology Center (also known as SciTech) is a science exhibit located directly in view of the Khobar Water Tower and north of the North Corniche of Khobar. The center has five permanent exhibits, known as Scientific Halls, each dedicated to a different branch of science. The center also hosts an IMAX cinema which generally only shows movies that are scientific and/or non-fictional. The center is open every day of the week from 9 am till 9 pm. Except for Friday, where it opens from 4 pm till 9 pm.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe most popular sport among the Saudis of Khobar is football. The Al-Qadsiah FC (Saudi Professional League) and the Al-Nahda Club (Saudi First Division) are two of the teams based in Khobar and Dammam, with their home grounds being at Prince Saud bin Jalawi Stadium and Prince Mohammad bin Fahd Stadium, respectively. Expatriates of the city have brought with them several sports, such as cricket, volleyball, badminton, and kho kho, among others.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nEastern Province\nDammam\nDhahran\nKing Fahd Causeway\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n Khobar travel guide from Wikivoyage",

He was the founder of Al-Rajhi Bank, the largest Islamic banking institution.\nThe eldest of the Al Rajhi family, he was engaged in other successful industries such as construction, real estate and agriculture.  Aside from being a prominent Saudi businessman, he was also a philanthropist known for significant contributions in the field of agriculture, education and health. During his later years, Al Rajhi established instructions for the establishment of a foundation to manage continuous endowments towards the charities which he had constantly supported in life.\n\n\n== Early Life ==\nSaleh bin Abdul-Aziz bin Saleh ibn Suleiman ibn Mohammed ibn Nasser Al Rajhi was born 1921 in Bakriyyah, Qassim, KSA. His father, Sheikh Abdul-Aziz Al-Rajhi was a farmer and trader of lesser means.  After his father's move Riyadh to seek better business prospects, Saleh started his education under Sheikh Muhammad Ibn Ibrahim. He completed the Quran and other studies by the age of 13 years old.\n\n\n== Early Business Enterprise ==\nIn the early 1930s, Al Rajhi worked odd jobs at the local marketplace to earn money.  Initially, he worked as a porter.  Upon saving some money, Al Rajhi used it as capital to trade scrap items.  He bought and sold keys, locks and haberdashery items, hawking the items in public places, particularly in the busy areas adjacent to the markets and mosques.\nIn 1937, as Al Rajhi turned 16 years old, he managed to occupy a space among the vendors and set up a \"bastah\" (a small trading place on the ground demarcated by a sheet or cloth spread upon which items are placed).  He was first located in Safat, in front of the Grand Mosque in Riyadh. This involved breaking down Riyals into change \u2013 gursh and halalahs.  For this he earned a commission of 5%.\nAs his business grew, he changed his bastah for a chest.  This had kept his money in different denominations safe.  Gradually, his customers started to bring in different currencies for him to change.  Businessmen, pilgrims and travelers would exchange different monies from Indian Rupees to gold.\n\n\n== Currency Exchange Business ==\nIn 1947, Al Rajhi opened a formal currency shop in Riyadh.  He sent for his brothers, Mohammed and Sulaiman, to be a part of the business. Sulaiman, who later succeeded his brother as head of the family conglomerate, was a teenager then, hired for a salary of $10 to do exchange delivery and messenger jobs for the shop.  The older Al Rajhi developed the systems and methods by which they recorded, traded and handled the money they received.\nToward the 1950s, Al Rajhi sent his brother Sulaiman to Mecca to conduct the exchange business for pilgrims and business people who had frequented the area. Sulaiman, with the blessing of his older brother remained in Mecca and further expanded to Jeddah which was growing economically at the time as well.  The brothers conducted their currency business between the three branches for the next 25 years, which marked the beginnings Al-Rajhi Bank.\n\n\n== Al Rajhi Bank ==\nIn 1957, the brothers formally established the beginnings of Al-Rajhi Bank. With Al Rajhi travelling to other countries in the region to initiate relationships with various banking institutions.  He had also engaged in the first gold trade with Kuwait.  Aside from this, Al Rajhi also established a unique system of drafts and money transfers.  Eventually, he was able to connect to United States banks through his established reputation in the Middle East. By the 1960s, the Al Rajhis were banking in most of the major financial sectors across Europe and Asia. \n\n\n== Agriculture ==\n\n\n=== Al Batin Project ===\nIn 1993, Al Rajhi established an agricultural plantation in Buraydah City, Qassim region. It concentrated on the production of wheat, barley, watermelon, and an assortment of vegetable with an intercropping of date palms over 5,466 hectares of farmland.\nIn 1995, upon the instructions of Al Rajhi, the plantation diverted its direction and focused mainly on palm dates, planting 63,000 seedlings of 45 palm date varieties with the goal of reaching 200,000 trees. This project was supervised by the Ministry of Agriculture which approved of the installation of specialized irrigation systems.In 2006, the Al Batin Palm Project was recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records (General Information and Standard Achievements) as the largest palm tree project in the world.\n\n\n=== Durma Project ===\nIn 1994-1996, Al Rajhi started the Durma Project. With a land area of 760 hectares, specialized tissue palms were planted. The area had a unique characteristic which included high arability of the soil, availability of natural deep wells and low water tables. As with the Al Batin project, the farms were initially planted with wheat and barley and subsequently transitioned the crop to palm dates. The three-tiered project spearheaded by Al Rajhi spanning 1994-1996 aimed to plant 50,000 palm seedlings of different types.\n\n\n== Other Projects ==\nIn the 1990s Al-Rajhi turned over the reins of the heading the Al Rajhi Bank to focus on real estate and agriculture.  His ventures in these two sectors eventually became some of the most successful in KSA.  Aside from these, Al Rajhi held stakes in another financial of import Al Baraka Banking Group and shares in cement and construction ventures.\nAside from the main business of currency exchange and banking, Saleh Al Rajhi held various positions in other companies with the following designations:\n\n\n== See also ==\nSulaiman Abdul Aziz Al Rajhi\nAl Rajhi Bank\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "King Salman Park is a proposed large-scale public park and urban district to be developed in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Covering 13.4 square kilometers (5.1 square miles) on the grounds of a former airport, the park will be the largest city park in the world, five times the size of London\u2019s Hyde Park and four times the size of New York\u2019s Central Park. It is located in north-central Riyadh and will be served by five stations on the Green Line of the Riyadh Metro, as well as six main roads.\n\n\n== Announcement and plans ==\nThe development of King Salman Park was announced by the Saudi government in March 2019, and hailed for its size and scope. Saudi architecture and engineering firm Omrania was named as the lead design consultant on the project, collaborating with Danish firm Henning Larsen Architects on the master plan.At an inauguration ceremony on Thursday, March 14, 2019, Riyadh Gov. Prince Faisal bin Bandar said, \u201cThe planners have skillfully designed the park with small valleys and rocky formations, which resembles the Najd region, thus giving it a natural beauty and distinctiveness from other parks in the city.\u201d Construction is slated to begin in 2019 and continue gradually for several years.\n\n\n== Vision 2030 projects ==\nKing Salman Park is one of four initiatives launched simultaneously in Riyadh on March 19, 2019, to fulfill the Kingdom\u2019s Vision 2030 goals, along with Sports Boulevard, Green Riyadh (planting 7.5 million trees), and Riyadh Art (1,000 public art projects). The park will add significant green space to the Saudi capital city, which previously has had less green space per capita than other world cities.The stated goal of these programs is to create sustainable and healthy communities, drive action against climate change, and provide up to 70,000 new jobs. Additionally, the government says its aim is to \u201csignificantly improve the lives of its citizens, transform the city into an attractive destination, and make it one of the world\u2019s most livable cities.\u201d These projects will cost an estimated $23 billion in government funding and will also leverage $15 billion worth of private sector development.\n\n\n== Design features ==\nPreliminary plans call for a central park surrounded by cultural, residential, hotel, and commercial buildings. There will be 9.3 million square meters of green areas and a \u201cRoyal Art Complex\u201d of museums and theaters. A traffic-free path will form a 7.2-km (4.5 mile) \u201curban loop\u201d within the park, catering to walking, cycling, and autonomous modes of public transportation. The park landscape will include \u201cvalley\u201d pathways up to 30 meters (98 feet) deep, creating shaded areas with trickling streams and a variety of visitor attractions. These branching valleys are said to be inspired by Saudi Arabia\u2019s seasonally dry wadi riverbeds, converging toward the center of the site.Basem Al-Shihabi, the founder of Omrania, the selected design consultant, said the park will bring back \u201chuman life\" and \"will change the very nature of Riyadh. It will actually fulfill the meaning of Al-Riyadh: The green land.\u201d According to Middle East Architect magazine, \"The park's landscape consists of a series of branching valleys, inspired by Saudi's seasonally dry wadi river beds, converging towards the centre of the site. Around the edges of each branch, protected from direct sunlight, visitors will be encouraged to use gathering spaces and activity areas.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Diriyah (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0631\u0639\u064a\u0629\u200e), formerly romanized as Dereyeh and Dariyya, is a town in Saudi Arabia located on the north-western outskirts of the Saudi capital, Riyadh. Diriyah was the original home of the Saudi royal family, and served as the capital of the Emirate of Diriyah under the first Saudi dynasty from 1744 to 1818. Today, the town is the seat of the Diriyah Governorate, which also includes the villages of Uyayna, Jubayla, and Al-Ammariyyah, among others, and is part of Ar Riyad Province.\nThe Turaif district, the first capital of Saudis, in Diriyah was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2010. For the 2018\u201319 Formula E Season, it was announced that Diriyah would host the season opening race.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe ruins of the old city of Diriyah lay on either side of the narrow valley known as Wadi Hanifa, which continues southwards through Riyadh and beyond. Consisting almost entirely of mud-brick structures, the ruins are divided into three districts, Ghussaibah, Al-Mulaybeed, and Turaif, set on top of hills overlooking the valley.  Of the three, Turaif is the highest, and its bottom is easily accessible to tourists by foot.  Part of the city wall, running along the edges of the wadi and also made of mud-bricks, are still extant along with some short observation towers.\nThe modern city is built at a lower altitude at the foot of the hill upon which Turaif is located. To the north of the town, inside the valley, are a number of gardens, palm groves, and small farms and estates. A dam known as Al-Ilb lies further north.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== During Muhammad's era ===\n\nDuring the Islamic Prophet Muhammad's era the Expedition of Muhammad ibn Maslamah took place here in July, 627AD in Muharram, 6AH.A platoon of thirty Muslims under the leadership of Muhammad bin Maslamah was despatched on a military mission. It headed for the habitation of the Qurata, a sept of the Bakr clan of the Banu Kilab. The Muslims attacked that sept and dispersed them in all directions. Plenty of spoils (war booty) were captured and the Muslims returned with the chief of the tribe of Banu Hanifa, called Thumamah Bin Uthal Al-Hanafi.The event is also mentioned by the Muslim scholar Ibn Sa'd in his book about Muhammad's military campaigns. he wrote about the expedition:\n\nSARIYYAH OF MUHAMMAD IBN MASLAMAH AGAINST AL-QURATA.\nThen occurred the sariyyah of Muhammad Ibn Maslamah against al-Qurata. He set out on 10 Muharram in the beginning of the fifty ninth month from the hijrah of the Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him. He (Prophet) despatched him against al-Qurata, an under-tribe of Banu Bakr a branch of the Kilab.\nThey used to halt at al-Bakarat, a place in the vicinity of Dariyyah. Dariyyah issituas- ed at (a distance of) seven stages from al-Madinah. He had ordered him to surround it from all sides. So he marched in the night and...[Ibn Sa'd, Kitab al-tabaqat al-kabir, p. 96]\n\n\n=== Post 1400 ===\nAlthough the location is sometimes identified with an ancient settlement mentioned by Yaqut and Al-Hamadani known as \"Ghabra\", the history of Diriyah proper dates back to the 15th century. According to the chroniclers of Nejd, the city was founded in 1446\u201347 by Mani' Al-Muraydi (\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u064a\u062f\u064a), an ancestor of the Saudi royal family. Mani and his clan had come from the area of Al-Qatif in eastern Arabia, upon the invitation of Ibn Dir' (\u0627\u0628\u0646 \u062f\u0631\u0639), who was then the ruler of a group of settlements that now make up Riyadh. Ibn Dir' is said to have been a relative of Mani' Al-Mraydi, and Mani's clan is believed to have left the area of Wadi Hanifa at some unknown date and were merely returning to their country of origin.Initially, Mani' and his clan, known as the Mrudah, settled in Ghusaybah (\u0627\u0644\u063a\u0635\u064a\u0628\u0629) and Al-Mulaybeed (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u064a\u0628\u064a\u062f). The entire settlement was named Al-Dir'iyah, after Mani's benefactor Ibn Dir'. Later on, the district of Turaif (\u0637\u064f\u0631\u064a\u0641) was settled.  Many families from other towns or from the bedouin tribes of the nearby desert eventually settled in the area and by the 18th century Diriyah had become a well-known town in Nejd.\nAt that time, Muhammad ibn Saud emerged from a struggle within the ruling family of Al-Diriyah, the Al Miqrin (\u0645\u0642\u0631\u0646, sons of Miqrin, a descendant of Mani'), and became the emir, or ruler, of Al-Diriyah. In 1744, Ibn Saud took in a religious scholar named Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, who hailed from the town of Al-Uyaynah, lying on the same wadi some 30 miles upstream. Ibn Saud agreed to implement Muhammadi religious views, and what later became known as the First Saudi State, with its capital at Diriyah, was born. Within the next several decades, Ibn Saud and his immediate descendants managed to subjugate all of Nejd, as well as the eastern and western regions of Arabia, and sent raids into Iraq. Diriyah quickly swelled in size and increased in wealth, becoming the largest town in Nejd and a major city in Arabia by the standards of the time. However, the Saudis' conquest of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina drew the ire of the Ottoman Empire, the major Islamic power at the time, led to the Ottoman-Saudi War of 1811\u20131818 and an invasion of Arabia by Ottoman and Egyptian forces brought the Saudi state to an end in 1818, with Diriyah capitulating after a nearly-year-long siege. The leader of the invading force, Ibrahim Pasha, ordered the destruction of Diriyah. However, when a member of the local nobility tried to revive the Wahhabi state in Diriyah, Ibrahim ordered his troops to destroy the town even further and set whatever was left of it on fire. When the Saudis revived their fortunes in 1824 and again in 1902, they made their capital further south in Riyadh, which has remained their capital ever since.\"The Ottoman Empire viewed the Arab challenge with alarm- especially after the loss of Makkah and Al-Madinah, and the deletion of the Ottoman emperor's name from Friday prayers- and an Egyptian army under Ibrahim Pasha was sent to recover lost territory. In 1818 the army entered Dar'iya and after a six month siege penetrated the defenses on the Turaif, totally destroyed the houses and cut down every tree in the palm groves. The Egyptians were estimated to have lost 10,000 men in the siege, and the Saudi forces 1,800.\"The town's original inhabitants left Diriyah after 1818, with the bulk of them moving to Riyadh. In The Kingdom (first published in 1981), British author Robert Lacey observed that the Al Saud had \"left the shell of their old capital behind them, an enduring reminder of the frontiers of the possible\" and compared the old Diriyah to \"a sand-blown Pompeii\". However, the area was resettled in the late 20th century, mostly by former nomads (bedouin), and a new city was founded by the Saudi government in the late 1970s.  This new city of Diriyah grew in size and is now a small but modern town and the seat of its own governorate. The ruins remain a tourist attraction, and are subject to a slow restoration project on the part of the Saudi government.\n\n\n== Renovations and development plans ==\n\nSaudi Arabia has formed the Diriyah Gate Development Authority (DGDA) to oversee preservation and development of the historic site.  In 2018, Jerry Inzerillo, previously the CEO of Forbes Travel Guide, to lead the new authority; Inzerillo has said that Diriyah will soon be known as \"the Beverly Hills of Riyadh.\"Among the rebuilt structures are the Bath and guest house, the Qasr Nasr, the Saad bin Saud Palace (finished by the early 90s), the Burj Faysal (a wall tower renovated in the 80s), major sections of the wall surrounding Turaif and sections of the outer walls and some watch towers surrounding the wadi. Outside of the Turaif district, on the opposite side of the wadi Hanifa, the region of the mosque of Sheik Mohammad bin Abdulwahab has been completely remodelled, leaving only some of the more recent original structures standing to the north of the complexe build on the site of the historic mosque.\nThe \"Turief District Development Plan\" aims to turn the district into a major national, cultural and touristic center. Before turning the complete site into a modern open-air museum documentation and necessary investigations, including excavations especially in places that may need to be remodelled, are planned in three major phases. These will include sites such as:\nAl-Imam Mohammad bin Saud Mosque and Salwa Palace.\nIbraheem Ibn Saud Palace and Fahad Ibn Saud Palace.\nFarhan Ibn Saud Palace, Torki Ibn Saud Palace and Qoo'a Al-Sharia'a (eastern court of Salwa Palace)Once finished, there will be a new visitors center as well as a documentation center. Four new museums are planned for the district.\nA museum of war and defense (as this was the site of a major siege in Saudi Arabia).\nA museum of horses.\nA museum of social life.\nA museum of commerce and finance.Additionally a Turief traditional market will add to the open-air museum experience.\nDespite Muhammadi destruction of many Islamic, non-Islamic, and historical sites associated with the first Muslims; the Prophet's family and companions) and the strong discouraging of visiting such sites (including mosques), the Saudi government renovated the domain of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab turning it into a major tourist attraction.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nThe old city's historic structures include:\nSalwa Palace, It was the residence and first home of the Al Saud Amirs and Imams during the First Saudi State. It is considered the largest palace on the site, rising four stories high.  It is composed of five main parts built at different consecutive periods of time. It was probably finished by Saud ibn Abdul Aziz ibn Muhammad ibn Saud, who was Imam from 1803 to 1814.\nSaad bin Saud Palace, One of the largest palaces on the site, it is famous for its courtyard, which was used as a stable. The palace is completely restored and several stories high.\nThe Guest House and At-Turaif Bath House  a traditional building  consisting of a number of small courtyards surrounded by rooms. The Bath House is famous for its different architectural styles and shows how the building was waterproofed by using different plasters. Both the Guest and Bath Houses were supplied with water from a well in the wadi.\nImam Mohammad bin Saud Mosque, a mosque  built during the reign of Imam Mohammad bin Saud. Sheik Mohammad bin Abdulwahab used to give lessons about his reformed movement of Islam in this mosque. It became a center for religious education. Students used to travel to it from all parts of the Arabian Peninsula.\nMosim Park, Football ground in the Nakheel area. It is home to football team Mosim FC, who are called The Pride of Dir'iyah. Mosim Park was erected in 2007 after Mosim FC moved there from their old ground downtown of Riyadh.\nAl-Bujairi, one of the districts of the city. It is known for its unique style of its buildings that are inspired by the surrounding palm trees.The layout of the city itself can be easily studied in the National Museum of Saudi Arabia with the help of a large scale detailed model of the city on display there.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nDiriyah has a hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification BWh).\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nDiriyah ePrix\nList of battles of Muhammad\nList of cities and towns in Saudi Arabia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhoto gallery (in Arabic)",

        "wiki": "Black Panther is a 2018 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 18th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Ryan Coogler, who co-wrote the screenplay with Joe Robert Cole, and it stars Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther alongside Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker, and Andy Serkis. In Black Panther, T'Challa is crowned king of Wakanda following his father's death, but he is challenged by Killmonger who plans to abandon the country's isolationist policies and begin a global revolution.\nWesley Snipes expressed interest in working on a Black Panther film in 1992, but the project did not come to fruition. In September 2005, Marvel Studios announced a Black Panther film as one of ten based on Marvel characters and distributed by Paramount Pictures. Mark Bailey was hired to write a script in January 2011. Black Panther was officially announced in October 2014, and Boseman made his first appearance as the character in Captain America: Civil War (2016). Cole and Coogler had joined by then, with additional casting in May making Black Panther the first Marvel film with a predominantly black cast. Principal photography took place from January to April 2017 at EUE/Screen Gems Studios in the Atlanta metropolitan area, and Busan, South Korea.\nBlack Panther premiered in Los Angeles on January 29, 2018, and was released theatrically in the United States on February 16, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film received critical acclaim from critics, praising its direction, screenplay, acting (particularly that of Boseman, Jordan, and Wright), costume design, production values, and soundtrack, though the CG effects received some criticism. Many critics considered it to be one of the best films set in the MCU and noted its cultural significance, with organizations including the National Board of Review and American Film Institute naming it one of the top 10 films of 2018. The film grossed over $1.3 billion worldwide and broke numerous box office records, including the highest-grossing film by a black director. It became the ninth-highest-grossing film of all time, the third-highest-grossing film in the U.S. and Canada, and the second-highest-grossing film of 2018.\nThe film received numerous awards and nominations, with seven nominations at the 91st Academy Awards including Best Picture, with wins for Best Costume Design, Best Original Score, and Best Production Design. Black Panther is the first superhero film to receive a Best Picture nomination and the first MCU film to win an Academy Award. It also received three nominations at the 76th Golden Globe Awards, two wins at the 25th Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three wins at the 24th Critics' Choice Awards from twelve nominations, among others. A sequel, with Coogler returning to write and direct, is scheduled for May 2022.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThousands of years ago, five African tribes war over a meteorite containing the metal vibranium. One warrior ingests a \"heart-shaped herb\" affected by the metal and gains superhuman abilities, becoming the first \"Black Panther\". He unites all but the Jabari Tribe to form the nation of Wakanda. Over centuries, the Wakandans use the vibranium to develop advanced technology and isolate themselves from the world by posing as a Third World country. In 1992, Wakanda's King T'Chaka visits his brother N'Jobu, who is working undercover in Oakland, California. T'Chaka accuses N'Jobu of assisting black-market arms dealer Ulysses Klaue with stealing vibranium from Wakanda. N'Jobu's partner reveals he is Zuri, another undercover Wakandan, and confirms T'Chaka's suspicions.\nIn the present day, following T'Chaka's death, his son T'Challa returns to Wakanda to assume the throne. He and Okoye, the leader of the Dora Milaje regiment, extract T'Challa's ex-lover Nakia from an undercover assignment so she can attend his coronation ceremony with his mother Ramonda and younger sister Shuri. At the ceremony, the Jabari Tribe's leader M'Baku challenges T'Challa for the crown in ritual combat. T'Challa defeats M'Baku and persuades him to yield rather than die.\nWhen Klaue and his accomplice Erik Stevens steal a Wakandan artifact from a London museum, T'Challa's friend and Okoye's lover W'Kabi urges him to bring Klaue back alive. T'Challa, Okoye, and Nakia travel to Busan, South Korea, where Klaue plans to sell the artifact to CIA agent Everett K. Ross. A firefight erupts, and Klaue attempts to flee but is caught by T'Challa, who reluctantly releases him to Ross' custody. Klaue tells Ross that Wakanda's international image is a front for a technologically advanced civilization. Erik attacks and extracts Klaue as Ross is gravely injured protecting Nakia. Rather than pursue Klaue, T'Challa takes Ross to Wakanda, where their technology can save him.\nWhile Shuri heals Ross, T'Challa confronts Zuri about N'Jobu. Zuri explains that N'Jobu planned to share Wakanda's technology with people of African descent around the world to help them conquer their oppressors. As T'Chaka arrested N'Jobu, the latter attacked Zuri and forced T'Chaka to kill him. T'Chaka ordered Zuri to lie that N'Jobu had disappeared and left behind N'Jobu's American son to maintain the lie. This boy grew up to be Stevens, a U.S. black ops soldier who adopted the name \"Killmonger\". Meanwhile, Killmonger kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda. He is brought before the tribal elders, revealing his identity to be N'Jadaka and claim to the throne. Killmonger challenges T'Challa to ritual combat, where he kills Zuri, defeats T'Challa, and hurls him over a waterfall to his presumed death. Killmonger ingests the heart-shaped herb and orders the rest incinerated, but Nakia extracts one first. Killmonger, supported by W'Kabi and his army, prepares to distribute shipments of Wakandan weapons to operatives around the world.\nNakia, Shuri, Ramonda, and Ross flee to the Jabari Tribe for aid. They find a comatose T'Challa, rescued by the Jabari in repayment for sparing M'Baku's life. Healed by Nakia's herb, T'Challa returns to fight Killmonger, who dons his own Black Panther suit. W'Kabi and his army fight Shuri, Nakia, and the Dora Milaje, while Ross remotely pilots a jet and shoots down planes carrying the vibranium weapons. M'Baku and the Jabari arrive to reinforce T'Challa. Confronted by Okoye, W'Kabi and his army stand down. Fighting in Wakanda's vibranium mine, T'Challa disrupts Killmonger's suit and stabs him. Killmonger refuses to be healed, choosing to die a free man rather than be incarcerated.\nT'Challa establishes an outreach center at the building where N'Jobu died, to be run by Nakia and Shuri. In a mid-credits scene, T'Challa appears before the United Nations to reveal Wakanda's true nature to the world. In a post-credits scene, Shuri helps Bucky Barnes with his recovery.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\nChadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther:The king of the African nation of Wakanda who gains enhanced strength by ingesting the heart-shaped herb. He ascends to the throne following the death of his father T'Chaka in Captain America: Civil War (2016). Boseman called T'Challa an anti-hero who is \"very much aware\" of his responsibility as the leader of Wakanda. Black Panther's suit, which forms around his body, was inspired by a similar design in Ta-Nehisi Coates' Black Panther comic book run. For his Wakandan accent, Boseman worked with the same dialect coach he had for Message from the King (2016), and worked with Marrese Crump to stay in shape between Civil War and Black Panther. To prepare for the role, Boseman visited South Africa twice; examined Shaka Zulu, Patrice Lumumba, speeches from Nelson Mandela, and Fela Kuti songs; talked to a Yoruba Babalawo; trained in Dambe, Capoeira Angola, and Zulu stick fighting; and took a DNA test to better understand his African ancestry. He signed a five-film contract with Marvel. Ashton Tyler plays a young T'Challa.:i\nMichael B. Jordan as N'Jadaka / Erik \"Killmonger\" Stevens:A U.S. black-ops soldier who seeks to overthrow his cousin T'Challa, with his own opinion on how Wakanda should be ruled. Jordan had wanted to play a villain for \"a while\", and likened Killmonger and T'Challa's relationship to the X-Men characters Magneto and Professor X. He added that Killmonger is strategic, thoughtful, patient, and \"trained to a T\". Killmonger's bumpy, ritualistic tribal markings on his chest and torso resemble the scar tattoos of the Mursi and Surma tribes, and consisted of 90 individually sculpted silicone molds that took two-and-a-half hours to apply.:21 Jordan would have to sit in a sauna for two hours at the end of the day to remove the prosthetics. Killmonger's dreadlocks hairstyle was a modern take on the character's long hair in the comics. To prepare for the role, Jordan studied Malcolm X, Marcus Garvey, Huey P. Newton, Fred Hampton, and Tupac Shakur. He also cited Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker in The Dark Knight (2008) as an influence. Corey Calliet, who had previously worked with Jordan on Creed (2015), served as his trainer. Seth Carr plays a young Stevens.:i\nLupita Nyong'o as Nakia:T'Challa's former lover and a War Dog, an undercover spy for Wakanda, from the River Tribe. Nyong'o called Nakia a \"departure\" from her comic counterpart. She begins the film fighting for enslaved women in Nigeria. Nyong'o trained in judo, jujitsu, silat, and Filipino martial arts.\nDanai Gurira as Okoye:An \"extremely proud\" Wakandan traditionalist from the Border Tribe who is the head of the Dora Milaje, Wakanda's all-female special forces and T'Challa's bodyguards. Director Ryan Coogler cast Gurira based on her performance in Mother of George (2013), rather than her popular role of Michonne in the television series The Walking Dead, which Coogler had not seen. Gurira said that the fighting skills she learned playing Michonne complemented the skills of Okoye, but noted that the Dora Milaje are a secret service, which covers intel as well as fighting. She explained that though the character is stoic, \"she also has an unexpected sense of humor. She has a heart, but for her country and for her people.\" Gurira's head was re-shaved every day to have her head tattoos applied, which took two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half hours.\nMartin Freeman as Everett K. Ross:A member of the Central Intelligence Agency whom Freeman described as having an \"uneasy peace\" with T'Challa. He added that the character goes on an \"enlightening journey to Wakanda\" in the film. Freeman and the filmmakers sought to depict Ross as a capable agent rather than just comic relief as he is in the comics.\nDaniel Kaluuya as W'Kabi: A confidant to T'Challa and his best friend who is the head of security for the Border Tribe, serving as the first line of defense for Wakanda.\nLetitia Wright as Shuri:T'Challa's 16-year-old sister who designs new technology for the country. Wright described Shuri as innovative of spirit and mind, wanting to take Wakanda to \"a new place\", and felt she was a good role model for young black girls. Executive producer Nate Moore called Shuri the smartest person in the world, even more so than Tony Stark.\nWinston Duke as M'Baku:A powerful, ruthless warrior who is the leader of Wakanda's mountain tribe, the Jabari, who protest T'Challa being the new king. Duke described the Jabari as people who \"strongly believe that to move forward, you have to have a strong adherence and respect for the past. So they have a deep moral conscience.\" Character elements from Christopher Priest's 1998\u20132003 Black Panther series were adapted for M'Baku's portrayal in the film. M'Baku is not referred to in the film by his comics alter ego \"Man-Ape\", since Marvel felt there were \"a lot of racial implications that don't sit well\" in having a black character dress up as an ape. This aspect of the character was instead reworked to have the Jabari tribe worship the gorilla gods, with M'Baku still wearing elements of fur on his arms and legs and a chest-plate that hints at the gorilla. Moore continued, \"Man-Ape is a problematic character for a lot of reasons, but the idea behind Man-Ape we thought was really fascinating ... It's a line I think we're walking, and hopefully walking successfully.\" To further differentiate the Jabari, Duke spoke a version of the Nigerian Igbo language rather than the Xhosa language spoken by other Wakandans.\nAngela Bassett as Ramonda:T'Challa and Shuri's mother, the Queen Mother of Wakanda. Ramonda serves as an adviser to T'Challa for when he would otherwise have turned to his father. Bassett wore a silver, waist-length wig for the role that was made from 120 pieces of hair hand-rolled into dreadlocks. Calliet also served as Bassett's trainer before and during filming, creating high-intensity interval training circuits and helping to craft her diet.\nForest Whitaker as Zuri:An elder statesman of Wakanda and the keeper of the heart-shaped herb. Coogler called Zuri a religious and spiritual figure, referencing the spirituality of Wakanda from the comics, and compared him to Obi-Wan Kenobi from the Star Wars series. Zuri is also a \"major tie back\" to T'Chaka for T'Challa. Denzel Whitaker, who is not related to Forest, plays a young Zuri.\nAndy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue:A South African black-market arms dealer, smuggler and gangster, who is allied with Killmonger. Klaue uses a segment of advanced Wakandan mining equipment as a sonic disruptor arm-cannon that serves to replace his left arm, which was lost in Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015). Boseman described Klaue as a threat to Wakanda, one of the few outsiders to enter the country, and someone with access to vibranium. He compared the character to Osama bin Laden. Serkis added that in addition to his desire for vibranium, Klaue is motivated by a \"personal\" vendetta against T'Challa, and \"to expose what he thinks is the hypocrisy of Wakanda\".Additionally, John Kani and Florence Kasumba reprise their respective roles of T'Chaka and Ayo from Captain America: Civil War. Kani's son Atandwa Kani portrays a young T'Chaka, and Sterling K. Brown plays his brother N'Jobu, who is Killmonger's father. Wakandan elders in the film include Isaach de Bankol\u00e9 for the River Tribe,:i Connie Chiume for the Mining Tribe,:i Dorothy Steel for the Merchant Tribe, and Danny Sapani for the Border Tribe.:i Sydelle Noel appears as Xoliswa, a member of the Dora Milaje. Marija Abney, Janeshia Adams-Ginyard, Maria Hippolyte, Marie Mouroum, J\u00e9nel Stevens, Zola Williams, Christine Hollingsworth, and Shaunette Ren\u00e9e Wilson also play Doras.:i Nabiyah Be initially announced that she was playing criminal Tilda Johnson, but her character was simply named Linda in the final film due to Gabrielle Dennis being cast as Johnson in the second season of Luke Cage.:i Comedian Trevor Noah voices Griot, a Wakandan ship A.I., Black Panther co-creator Stan Lee has a cameo as a patron in the South Korean casino, and Sebastian Stan makes an uncredited appearance in the post-credits scene reprising his role as Bucky Barnes.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nIn June 1992, Wesley Snipes announced his intention to make a film about Black Panther, and began work on it by that August. Snipes felt that Africa had been portrayed poorly in Hollywood films previously, and that this film could highlight the majesty of the continent due to the character being noble and \"the antithesis of [African] stereotypes\". The next July, Snipes planned to begin The Black Panther after starring in Demolition Man (1993), and a month later he expressed interest in making sequels to the film as well. In January 1994, Snipes entered talks with Columbia Pictures to portray Black Panther, and Black Panther co-creator Stan Lee joined the film by March; it entered early development by May. Snipes had discussions with several different screenwriters and directors about the project, including Mario Van Peebles and John Singleton. When the film had not progressed by January 1996, Lee explained that he had not been pleased with the scripts for the project. Snipes said that one of the issues with the project's development was confusion among those unfamiliar with the comics, who thought the film was about the Black Panther Party.\n\nIn July 1997, Black Panther was listed as part of Marvel Comics' film slate, and in March 1998, Marvel reportedly hired Joe Quesada and Jimmy Palmiotti, who at the time were editors of the Black Panther comics, to work on it; Quesada and Palmiotti have both denied this. That August, corporate problems at Marvel put the project on hold. A year later, Snipes was set to produce, and possibly star, in the film, while Artisan Entertainment announced a deal with Marvel in May 2000 to co-produce, finance, and distribute the film. In March 2002, Snipes planned to make the film or Blade 3 (2004) over the next year. In July 2004, Blade 3 director David S. Goyer stated that he felt Snipes starring as Black Panther in addition to Marvel's Blade \"might be overkill\".In September 2005, Marvel chairman and CEO Avi Arad announced Black Panther as one of ten films being developed by the new Marvel Studios. Marvel Studios received financing to produce the slate of ten films to be distributed by Paramount Pictures. In June 2006, Snipes said he hoped to have a director for the project soon, and Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige reiterated in February 2007 that Black Panther was in development. By that July, Singleton had been approached to direct the film. In March 2009, Marvel hired writers to help come up with creative ways to launch its lesser-known properties, including Black Panther; Nate Moore, the head of the writers program, was overseeing the development of Black Panther specifically. Snipes' involvement stalled at this time, as he was convicted of failing to file a tax return, serving his sentence from June 2010 to April 2013. In January 2011, Marvel Studios hired documentary filmmaker Mark Bailey to write a script for Black Panther, to be produced by Feige. By October 2013, the metal vibranium, which comes from Black Panther's home nation Wakanda, was introduced in the Marvel Cinematic Universe; Marvel had considered showing Wakanda itself as early as Iron Man 2 (2010), but were waiting until they had \"a full idea\" of how to depict it.In October 2014, Feige announced that Black Panther would be released on November 3, 2017, with Chadwick Boseman cast as T'Challa / Black Panther. Boseman did not audition for the role, instead discussing what he wanted to do with the part with Marvel, and earned $2 million for appearing in the film. The actor was set to first portray the character in Captain America: Civil War. Snipes gave his support for the project, despite no longer being involved. Feige said that Marvel was considering minority writers and directors for the film, but would prioritize \"the best filmmakers, the best writers, the best directors possible. So I'm not going to say for sure that we're going to hire from any one demographic\". He added that they had met with former Black Panther comics writer Reginald Hudlin. In January 2015, Boseman said that the film was going through a \"brainstorming phase\", and the next month Marvel pushed back the release date to July 6, 2018. Also in February, Feige stated that casting for the film was underway, and added that he was set to meet with directors about the film following the release of Avengers: Age of Ultron at the end of April.By May 2015, Marvel had discussions with Ava DuVernay to work on either Black Panther or Captain Marvel (2019) as director. In June, Feige confirmed that he had met with several directors, including DuVernay, and said that he expected a decision to be made by mid- to late 2015. By early July, DuVernay had passed on directing the film, explaining that she had been drawn to the cultural importance of depicting a black hero to the whole world, but disagreed with Marvel on the story and did not want to compromise her vision. By October 2015, F. Gary Gray and Ryan Coogler had been considered as directors for the film, though negotiations with Coogler had cooled, and Gray had chosen to direct The Fate of the Furious (2017) instead. Joe Robert Cole, a member of the Marvel writers program, was in talks to write the screenplay, and Marvel changed the release date once again, moving it to February 16, 2018. By December, discussions with Coogler were reignited after the successful opening of his film Creed (2015).\n\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nCoogler was confirmed as director in January 2016, and said that the film was his \"most personal movie to date\" in part because he grew up reading comics, adding, \"I feel really fortunate to be able to work on something I'm this passionate about again.\" After being \"wooed\" by Feige for months, Coogler agreed to direct the film if he could bring collaborators from his previous films to differentiate the film from other MCU films that are often \"shot, composed, and edited by the same in-house people\". This included Fruitvale Station (2013) cinematographer Rachel Morrison, as well as production designer Hannah Beachler and composer Ludwig G\u00f6ransson, who both worked with Coogler on Fruitvale Station and Creed. Coogler felt Black Panther would be unique while still fitting within the MCU's overall narrative.\n\nIn April 2016, Feige said that Coogler was working on the script with Cole, and that filming would begin at the beginning of 2017. He added that the film would be the first Marvel Studios production to feature a \"primarily African-American cast\": Lupita Nyong'o soon entered negotiations to star as T'Challa's love interest, and Michael B. Jordan joined in an undisclosed role, after previously working with Coogler on Fruitvale Station and Creed. Nate Moore, serving as a producer on the film by the end of May, stated that filming would occur in Atlanta, Georgia, with Marvel \"definitely investigating shooting in Africa\" as well.At San Diego Comic-Con 2016, Nyong'o was confirmed for the film, in the role of Nakia, while Jordan's role was revealed to be Erik Killmonger. Also announced was Danai Gurira as Okoye. Coogler confirmed that filming would begin in January 2017. Additional casting occurred from September 2016 until the start of filming, with Winston Duke cast as M'Baku, a role that Yahya Abdul-Mateen II had also tested for; Forest Whitaker as Zuri; Daniel Kaluuya as W'Kabi; Angela Bassett as T'Challa's mother, Ramonda; Sterling K. Brown as N'Jobu; and Letitia Wright in an unspecified role. Florence Kasumba was revealed to be reprising her role as Ayo from Captain America: Civil War. Amandla Stenberg, who is bi-racial and light skinned, was considered for a role in the film but was not comfortable taking the place of a dark-skinned actor, and described her decision to pass on the role as \"really challenging\". By January 2017, Marvel received permission from the Oakland, California-based public transit agency AC Transit to use their logo in the film for the opening flashback sequence. The setting was chosen due to Coogler growing up in that area.\n\n\n==== Writing ====\n\nThe production team was inspired by Ta-Nehisi Coates' run on Black Panther, who was writing the comic at the same time as they were working on the film. Of particular inspiration was Coates' poetic dialogue, Brian Stelfreeze's art, and \"some of the questions that it's asking\". The film was also inspired by the comic runs of Jack Kirby, Christopher Priest (which Coogler felt most influenced the film), Jonathan Hickman, and Hudlin. Characters for the film were picked from throughout the comics based on what worked for the film's story. The ceremonial betrothal aspect of the Dora Milaje was not adapted from the comics for the film. Coogler had hoped to include Spider-Man villain Kraven the Hunter early in the process because of a scene in Priest's run that had T'Challa fighting Kraven, but the rights to the character were not available. Donald Glover and his brother Stephen made some minor contributions to an early draft of the script, developing the relationship between T'Challa and his younger sister Shuri. Moore noted that an early script had more scenes outside of Wakanda to explore \"what it means to be African and African-American in the world a bit more\", and hoped these could be revisited in a later film, particularly a \"super cool\" sequence that was storyboarded before being cut.Feige described Black Panther as \"a big geopolitical action adventure\" that focuses on family and T'Challa learning to be king, with Civil War laying the groundwork for T'Challa's morality and establishing the geopolitical landscape that he would have to deal with on returning to Wakanda. Moore compared the politics and humor of the film to Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), saying that the former would be inherent but not \"preachy\", and that the latter would avoid the tones of Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and Ant-Man (2015). He also said the film would be a cross between The Godfather (1972) and the James Bond films as a \"big, operatic family drama centered around a world of international espionage\". Coogler was influenced by 1970s films such as the works of Francis Ford Coppola in that decade, as well as crime fiction. He also watched the film A Prophet (2009) for inspiration. Feige called the film's story \"rich in culturally relevant ideas\", with Boseman indicating there were parallels to \"pull from\" in the film in relation to Donald Trump becoming President of the United States after Barack Obama, though Feige added that \"these are conversations we were having two years ago because that is inherently the story within the comics.\" Moore said the film does not depend on the plots of any other MCU films, but it does affect the wider MCU moving forward, with Feige stating the film was \"a very important\" link to Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019). Civil War did introduce the Wakandan language, based on the Xhosa language, which Boseman was taught by John Kani who portrays T'Challa's father King T'Chaka. Additional actors portraying Wakandans in Black Panther learned the language, with Coogler making the use of the language \"a priority... as much as possible\". Coogler tried to incorporate Xhosa \"in natural and authentic situations\", such as when multiple Wakandans were speaking in the presence of nonnatives and wanted to say something they would not understand. John Kani's son Atandwa served as a dialect coach on the film along with his father.\n\n\n==== Design ====\nCole called the film an historic opportunity to depict a black superhero \"at a time when African-Americans are affirming their identities while dealing with vilification and dehumanization\". It was important to root the film in the actual cultures of Africa, with the filmmakers consulting with experts on the region of Africa that Wakanda is supposed to be located in, rooting the film \"in reality first and then build[ing] out from there\". Coogler's vision for Wakanda was inspired by the southern African country Lesotho, a country which has historically been \"an enclave, able to protect its independence because of its terrain\" and was only lightly colonized by the British; the country's traditional blankets are also featured in the film. Coogler compared the rarity of vibranium existing only in Wakanda to the real-life mineral coltan that can almost only be found in Congo. He wanted Wakanda to feel like a full country with multiple distinct tribes, and created a project bible that detailed each Wakandan tribe to guide the design process. Special care was taken to create a futuristic look that was not alien, as some of Jack Kirby's original comic designs appeared.\n\n\n===== Sets =====\nBeachler wanted to honor the comic designs, but fill in the gaps with research concentrated on Sub-Saharan Africa, pulling inspiration from Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Congo-Kinshasa, Ethiopia, as well as the designs of Zaha Hadid, and the pre-colonization architecture of the historic Mali Empire and the city of Timbuktu. Moore described this approach of taking inspiration from many different sources as a love letter to Africa. Beachler looked at the architecture of existing tribes, and then tried to advance the technology naturally rather than if Wakanda had been colonized. Circular motifs, signifying the transmission of energy, were an important theme throughout the film. Older locations depicted in the film, such as Warrior Falls, the City of the Dead, and the Hall of Kings, were juxtaposed with the more modern Afro-punk style of the Golden City, the capital. Rondavels were incorporated into the tops of Wakanda's skyscrapers, inspired by the appearance of mountains at Blyde River Canyon in South Africa.Beachler created different sigils and architecture for each of the Wakandan tribes, with the Border Tribe inspired by Lesotho, the Merchant Tribe having a sigil based on Nigerian writing, and the Golden Tribe using a sun symbol found throughout Africa. Gorilla City, home to the Jabari Tribe, was originally set in a rain forest, but Coogler suggested that it be found up a mountain in snow. Beachler based the written form of the Wakandan language on an old Nigerian language. She consulted with mining and metallurgy experts for the vibranium technology, including for the vibranium mine where the substance is depicted as glowing blue rocks before it is refined into the stainless steel look previously seen in the MCU. The film also adapts the kimoyo bead technology from the comics, and features sand-based technology. Beachler wanted futuristic elements of the film to be consistent with projections of what real world technology may be like in 25 or 30 years, such as the maglev and hovercraft technology used in vehicles. The Wakandan vehicles include a maglev train for carrying vibranium; the king's Royal Talon Fighter, which looks like a mask from the top and bottom; and the Dragon Flyer, inspired by the Congo peafowl.The majority of Beachler's sets were constructed on sound stages in Atlanta, including the Tribal Council, Shuri's design space, and the Hall of Kings. The Tribal Council set was built with a glass floor through which an old ruin can be seen. The exterior set for Warrior Falls was built on a backlot north of Atlanta, and was inspired by the Oribi Gorge. The set was 36 feet (11 m), made up of a six-foot-high (1.8 m) pool, and then 30-foot-high (9.1 m) cliff faces that were designed to be extended to 100 feet (30 m) with visual effects. A framework for the cliffs was hand-sculpted from industrial styrofoam, with a system of tunnels built-in to the design to allow extras to climb up to different areas of the cliffs. The framework was then covered with 25,000 cubic feet (710 m3) of foam that was sculptured to match rocks found at Oribi Gorge. The pool was filled using six large pumps, so as to create a waterfall above the ledge at the bottom. The base of the pool was made from padding so stunts could safely be carried out on the set, but designed to look like rocks and to have enough grip that the actors would not fall over in the water. The set was completed in four months, and was used for two weeks of filming.\n\n\n===== Costumes =====\n\nCostume designer Ruth E. Carter referenced the Maasai, Himba, Dogon, Basotho, Tuareg, Turkana, Xhosa, Zulu, Suri and Dinka people in her designs. She also examined appropriate works by Japanese fashion designer Issey Miyake, French fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent, and American fashion designer Donna Karan. Winnie Mandela provided inspiration to Carter for Angela Bassett's costumes.The Dora Milaje costumes primarily used red to reflect different African cultures, and included beaded tabards that feature talismans that would be passed down from mother to daughter. Carter wanted to avoid the \"girls in the bathing suits\" look, and instead have the Dora Milaje wear full armor that they would practically need for battle. She also had to take actors' stunt work into consideration. Anthony Francisco, the Senior Visual Development Illustrator, noted the Dora Milaje costumes were based 80 percent on the Maasai, five percent on samurai, five percent on ninjas, and five percent on the Ifugao people from the Philippines. The arm band and neck rings were a reference to the Southern Ndebele people and denote stature. As such, General Okoye has gold bands and rings while the other Dora Milaje wear silver.The costumes for T'Challa combined his role as king and as the head of the military, including combining a kente cloth cloak with military boots. Carter also used distinct colors and patterns for each of Wakanda's tribes, such as green with shells for the River Tribe based on the Suri; blue with wood for the Border Tribe; black with royal purple for the Black Panther and the Royal Palace; plums and purples for the Merchant Tribe in reference to the Tuareg; and ochre for the Mining Tribe inspired by the Himba. Three out of every five people in Wakanda go barefoot. The Wakandans wear \"normal\" clothes outside of the country, with the colors of their costumes kept consistent. Overall, Carter created 700 costumes for the film, working with \"an army\" of illustrators, designers, mold makers, fabric dyers, jewelry makers and more.Hair department head Camille Friend referenced traditional African art, fabrics, hair, and textures, and the current-day natural hair movement in her designs. Friend strived to keep the actors' hair natural, using \"braids, locs and twists\", and when necessary, extensions and wigs. As with Carter, Friend designed each tribe to have their own identifiable aesthetic, such as the Jabari Tribe having hair styled with \"very straight, clean lines\" and war-paint detail, inspired by Senegalese warriors.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography had begun by January 21, 2017, at EUE/Screen Gems Studios in the Atlanta metropolitan area, under the working title Motherland. Filming also took place in the Sweet Auburn neighborhood in Atlanta, which doubled as Oakland; the High Museum of Art, which served as the fictional Museum of Great Britain in London; and Atlanta City Hall, which served as a United Nations building. Cinematographer Rachel Morrison, who was eager to work on Black Panther after working with Coogler on Fruitvale Station, first watched all of the other MCU films to understand the established \"language\". She wanted to \"push\" that language and feature more contrast in color. Visual effects supervisor Geoff Baumann provided Morrison with before-and-after shots of scenes from Civil War so she could understand what elements are captured on set and what is created digitally. She filmed in 3.4K ArriRaw with Arri Alexa XT Plus cameras and Panavision Primo lenses, primarily using a two-camera set-up with a third or fourth camera on occasion. Morrison said that lighting was her biggest challenge, the magnitude of which \"was much bigger than I'd experienced before\", and made extensive use of Arri SkyPanel LED light fixtures, which she could preprogram from an iPad. Some sets were completely surrounded by SkyPanels.Shortly after filming started, Atandwa Kani stated that he would appear in the film alongside his father, the latter reprising the role of T'Chaka, while on-set photographs revealed that Martin Freeman would reprise his role as Everett K. Ross. Marvel announced that production was underway on January 26, and confirmed the casting of Freeman, Wright, and John Kani, while revealing that Andy Serkis would reprise his role as Ulysses Klaue from Avengers: Age of Ultron. Atandwa portrays a younger version of his father's character, and also served as a cultural consultant during filming. Dialect coach Beth McGuire worked to ensure there was continuity between the various actors who had to use \"Wakandan accents\". Jordan joined the production later than the rest of the core cast. He felt that this aided his performance, since his character is separate from and in conflict with the other characters. Because of this, Jordan kept to himself while he was on set. Since Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War were filming simultaneously in Atlanta, both production teams worked together closely to ensure a unified presentation of Wakanda in the films, as the country also plays a large role in Infinity War.Additional filming took place in South Korea, with the city of Busan serving as the setting of a car chase scene that involved 150 cars and over 700 people. Coogler and Morrison referenced the car chase sequences from Bullitt (1968), Drive (2011), and The French Connection (1971), taking the best elements from each for Black Panther's sequence. Filming in Busan began on March 17, at the Jagalchi Fish Market. Filming moved to Gwangalli Beach on March 21, with other South Korean filming locations including Marine City in the Haeundae District and at the Gwangandaegyo Bridge. The production crew hired hundreds of current and former film students from local universities as staff or assistant staff during the South Korea filming. Filming in the country wrapped on March 27, with additional location shooting also taking place at the Rwenzori Mountains and Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda. John Marzano served as cinematographer for aerial footage of South Africa, Zambia, Uganda, and South Korea. At CinemaCon 2017, Wright was revealed to be portraying Shuri in the film. Filming concluded on April 19, 2017.\n\n\n=== Post-production ===\n\n\n==== Editing ====\nBlack Panther was edited by Michael Shawver and Debbie Berman, with Shawver spending time on set during filming as well as at an editing suite near the Atlanta production base. Berman joined the film after an initial director's cut had been produced, two weeks after she completed work on Marvel's Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), because Coogler likes to have both a male and female editing his films. She believed that she was chosen by Marvel because she is South African, and had been expressing interest in Black Panther throughout the editing process for Homecoming after first seeing the character in Civil War. Shawver said that a lot of their time editing was spent discussing how their work was affecting the audience. For instance, Shawver felt that initial versions of the first Warrior Falls fight fell \"flat\" and used techniques he learned working with Coogler on Creed to have the editing move back-and-forth to mimic the back-and-forth of the fighters. He also felt that adding more reaction shots to the crowd during the fight gave more weight to T'Challa's victory at the end. During work on the final battle, Berman pointed out to Coogler that the female Dora Milaje are rescued by the all-male Jabari tribe, which she felt undermined the focus on female characters leading up to that moment. Coogler agreed, and subsequently added female Jabari fighters to the scene through additional photography, including the first onscreen Jabari fighter in the scene. Berman felt that this was an important change that would not have been made if only men were editing the film.As first hinted by Coogler in January 2018, the film includes two post-credit scenes: one showing T'Challa address the United Nations; and one featuring Sebastian Stan reprising his role as Bucky Barnes. The first scene was originally intended to be part of the actual ending of the film, but was moved to during the credits so the film could conclude in Oakland, where it begins. Coogler felt having this symmetry was important. In the scene, T'Challa says \"The foolish build barriers, while the wise build bridges.\" Some felt this was a reference to the political climate of the presidency of Donald Trump, but Coogler stated that the line was added before Trump's election and was simply an African proverb that his wife had found. His intention with the scene was to inspire the audience by making T'Challa seem like a real person in a familiar, real-world environment, similar to how Tony Stark was treated in Iron Man (2008). Coogler was not mandated by Marvel to feature connections to other films, but was interested in addressing the fact that Barnes was in Wakanda (per the end of Civil War) because it would be fun for the audience. He did not feel the character fit in the body of the film, but felt that an end-credits scene was appropriate.\n\n\n==== Visual effects ====\nVisual effects for the film were created by: Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) with help from Virtuos, Stereo D, and Scanline VFX; Double Negative; Luma Pictures; Mammal Studios; Method Studios; Perception; Rise Visual Effects Studios; Torm Studios; Trixter; Cantina Creative; Lola VFX; Capital T; Exceptional Minds; Technicolor VFX; Rodeo FX; Imageloom VFX; Anibrain; Method Pune; Bot VFX; Pixstone Images; Futureworks; Vertigo Visual; FX3X; and Yannix Thailand Co. Previsualization was completed by Digital Domain and The Third Floor. Geoffrey Baumann served as visual effects supervisor.\n\nComparing Black Panther to other MCU films, Baumann noted that the visual effects department often have free rein when creating otherworldly science fiction designs, but had to be more specific with this film due to the need to be authentic to African culture and geography. For the Warrior Falls environment, the amphitheater-like cliff walls had to be populated with digital spectators that could not simply be copy-and-pasted around the set due to the precise costume designs created by Carter for each tribe and character. Instead, the visual effects department had to work with the costumers to individually model each digital extra for the sequence. Additionally, visual effects were also used to adjust the opening sequence after test audiences were confusing the characters of T'Chaka and T'Challa, both dressed as the Black Panther. Artists digitally added some grey to T'Chaka's beard and gold trimmings to his suit to help differentiate the characters.ILM was primarily responsible for creating the digital urban environments of Wakanda. ILM VFX supervisor Craig Hammack compared this work to his time on Tomorrowland (2015), but noted the additional challenge of not just building a futuristic city, but also one that was culturally appropriate. He explained that African culture has a \"certain amount of earthy material qualities that make things difficult to design as a futuristic city,\" which would typically use much steel and glass. ILM looked to real life examples that blend modern architecture with natural environments like One Central Park in Sydney and The Pearl of Africa Hotel in Kampala, but also had to \"depart from a strict understanding of physics and go into a movie cheat world\" at times to produce the desired look. Hammack was also inspired by the architecture of Uganda, where he spent time while aerial footage for the film was being shot. 60,000 individual buildings were designed and modeled for the city, which Hammack said was the first thing ILM began work on and also the last thing they were doing when the film was completed. Other things that ILM worked on during the production included set extensions and blue-screen replacements for interior sets, and the first rhinoceros shown in the film. For T'Challa's ancestral plane scenes, ILM replaced the basic set that was used with a full CG environment including an acacia tree and animated panthers. The sky was based on the Northern Lights, with this first designed for nighttime scenes before being replicated for daytime scenes in which the animators had to work hard to keep the effects visible. ILM also added additional sand for the burial sequences so Boseman could breathe during filming, and additional flames when Killmonger burns the heart-shaped herb.Method Studios created many of the natural environments of Wakanda. The company built a 3,600 km2 (1,400 sq mi) landscape that is visible in various aerial shots in the film, which was based on multiple landscapes from across Africa. Method was also responsible for creating Black Panther's and Killmonger's digital suits, including developing the look of the nanotechnology they use. They created many of the film's digital characters, vehicles, and weapons, with some of those digital creatures being rhinoceroses for the final battle, a sequence that Method did the majority of the work for. Because these rhinoceroses did not have to be seen on screen with the one designed by ILM, only basic structures, scale, and details of the character models had to be shared between the two companies. Much of the work for the final fight included crowd simulation, with Method working alongside the stunt coordinators in motion capture sessions to give each fighter a unique style. In addition to randomizing the height and weight of each digital fighter, the models had to incorporate specific design elements from the costumers. Method also worked on the vibranium mine and Shuri's laboratory, including animating the gadgets seen in the latter.Luma Pictures worked on the Busan car chase sequence, digitally creating the cars featured in the sequence based on CAD models and on-set reference. Multiple digital versions of the same car were created, so the production could have the actual cars crash and do various stunts with them, with Luma then inserting the digital versions to augment these moments. Luma also created the sonic forces from Klaue's cannon, while Scanline VFX worked on digitally removing Serkis' left arm for the London museum heist sequence. Several companies worked on the vibranium sand effects used in Wakandan technology, including ILM for the beginning of the film. Perception spent 18 months researching real-world technologies, phenomena, and visual themes to aid them in their work on the film. Their designs for the vibranium sand were based on research being done with ultrasonic transducers for the purpose of mid-air haptics and acoustic levitation. They integrated this research into the kimoyo beads worn by Wakandans and as a working interface on the royal talon fighter. Perception also created the traditional displays on the talon fighter and in Shuri's lab. For the talon fighter, the company \"experimented with parallax, depth, and volume in the information being displayed, as well as developing a unique color palette to brand the Wakandan tech\". In Shuri's lab, Perception adjusted the hues on the wall to match her attire, and for her healing room \"proposed that the hexagonal pattern seen on the wall actually reveal itself to be articulating panels\" that \"pulse and ripple\". The company also created the function of Black Panther's suit with nano technology and \"layering the suit with different patterns as well as adding 'sub-dermal' luminescent tattoos\", the virtual car chase with Shuri and T'Challa, and designed the opening prologue, with the final version created by Storm VFX. Perception also created the main-on-end title sequence.\n\n\n== Music ==\n\nAfter reading the script, composer Ludwig G\u00f6ransson decided to go to Africa to do research for the film. He spent a month in Senegal, first traveling around with musician Baaba Maal on his tour, and then spending several weeks working with local musicians to form the \"base\" of his score. G\u00f6ransson was particularly drawn to the talking drum and the tambin, or Fula flute, to use in his character themes, along with horns. Nate Moore compared the work G\u00f6ransson did in defining the sound of the film to the use of music by James Gunn in the Guardians of the Galaxy films, with the composer pushing Marvel out of their comfort zone.Kendrick Lamar produced the film's curated soundtrack, Black Panther: The Album, along with Top Dawg Entertainment founder Anthony Tiffith, after Coogler wanted to include original songs from Lamar in the film because his \"artistic themes align with those we explore in the film\". The soundtrack features songs that are heard in the film as well as others that are inspired by it, with the other artists featured the majority of \"top-billing names\" under Top Dawg Entertainment. G\u00f6ransson collaborated with Lamar and producer Sounwave on the soundtrack. Three singles from the album were released throughout January and February 2018: \"All the Stars\", \"King's Dead\", and \"Pray for Me\". Black Panther: The Album was released on February 9, 2018, while a soundtrack of G\u00f6ransson's score was released on February 16. An extended play titled Black Panther: Wakanda Remixed, featuring remixes of five cues from G\u00f6ransson's score, was released on August 16, 2018. G\u00f6ransson worked with several other artists to create the remixes.\n\n\n== Marketing ==\nMarvel debuted early footage and concept art from the film at a press event in April 2017. Kyle Buchanan at Vulture.com praised the cinematography, costume and production design, and black cast, saying \"Black Panther doesn't look like any of the other Marvel movies ... If this is what the future of superhero movies looks like, deal me in.\" The screened footage was the first time Marvel had shown raw dailies, which Feige said they did to show off the \"highest-class cast we've had\" despite editing having not yet begun. A poster was released ahead of the first teaser trailer, which premiered during Game 4 of the 2017 NBA Finals. Fans on Twitter felt the poster was poorly photoshopped, and it was compared to a real-life picture of Black Panther Party co-founder Huey P. Newton. The trailer received a much more positive response, with Peter Sciretta of /Film finding it unexpected and refreshing, io9's Charles Pulliam-Moore calling it \"every bit as intense as you were hoping it would be\", and Andrew Husband for Uproxx feeling the single teaser outshone the entire Homecoming marketing campaign. It was viewed 89 million times in 24 hours, generating 349,000 mentions (second only to the amount the Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017) teaser received) and \"dominated the conversation on social media\" over Game 4. Per comScore and its PreAct service, the film was the subject of the most new social media conversations for the rest of the week, and the second-most for the week ending June 18, behind Homecoming.\n\nCostumes from the film were on display at D23 Expo 2017 and the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con, with Coogler, Boseman, and other members of the cast presenting exclusive footage of the film at the latter event, to a standing ovation from the audience. In September, Coogler, Gurira, and Moore participated in a panel at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Annual Legislative Conference, where exclusive footage from the film was also shown and met with a positive response. On October 16, 2017, a full trailer was released. Dave Trumbore for Collider praised the trailer for showing an \"unmistakable sense of style\" unique to the character, while BamSmackPow's Brendan Day felt the trailer \"does everything right\". Writing for Rolling Stone, Tre Johnson felt the trailer showed T'Challa as \"someone with the arrogance of [John] Shaft, the coolness of [Barack] Obama and the hot-headed impulsiveness of Kanye West\". A few days later, Marvel Comics published a prelude tie-in comic focusing on one of T'Challa's first missions as the Black Panther set around the time of Iron Man. The first College Football Playoff National Championship halftime show was organized by Disney for the 2018 championship game, with Kendrick Lamar performing to promote Black Panther: The Album and the beginning of ticket sales for the film.By February 12, Black Panther was the most-tweeted about film of 2018 with more than 5 million tweets globally, and in mid-March it became the most-tweeted-about film ever with 35 million. During New York Fashion Week, designers Cushnie et Ochs, Ikir\u00e9 Jones, Tome, Sophie Theallet, Fear of God, Chromat, and LaQuan Smith created custom pieces that were inspired by the film for an event titled \"Welcome to Wakanda: Fashion for the Black Panther Era\". Marvel Studios formed a partnership with Lexus on the film, with the 2018 Lexus LC being featured in it. The partnership produced a graphic novel, Black Panther: Soul of a Machine, which was released in December 2017 from writers Fabian Nicieza, Geoffrey Thorne, and Chuck Brown; a concept coupe from Lexus inspired by the character; and a Super Bowl LII commercial featuring Boseman, Gurira and Wright, which had 4.3 million views on social media after its Super Bowl airing, according to RelishMix. Other marketing partners included shoe manufacturer Clarks creating a film-inspired variant of their Originals' Trigenic Evo shoe; PepsiCo and Unilever launching an arts program for young people in urban areas to be mentored by established artists; Brisk created an interactive Black Panther installation at the 2018 NBA All-Star Game; Lanc\u00f4me highlighted a line of makeup that Nyong'o and Wright used at the film's premiere; and Synchrony Financial with Marvel awarded the Ghetto Film School Fellows program with a $50,000 grant, with Coogler speaking to the school's students.Overall, Black Panther had the most expansive advertising budget and biggest line of merchandise of any Marvel non-sequel. Deadline Hollywood estimated that budget to be $150 million. Asad Ayaz, Executive Vice President of Marketing for Marvel films, said the campaign was about \"super-serving\" black audiences while still trying to appeal to all, in order to make the film \"feel like a cultural event\". Disney and Marvel created a \"synergy program\" with the College Football Playoffs on ESPN, the ABC television series Black-ish, Grey's Anatomy, Scandal, and How to Get Away With Murder, the Freeform series Grown-ish, and the Bravo franchise The Real Housewives. Marketing outside the United States was \"fairly uniform\", though in the Middle East the focus was kept on Black Panther in-costume as superhero films \"just keep working\" there according to Gianluca Chakra of Middle East distributor Front Row. This was the same for Asian territories. A Wakanda exhibit was featured in malls in seven Chinese cities, along with displays showing Black Panther with other MCU characters. A special trailer created for China had Boseman explain the character's connection to other MCU films. Weibo attended the Los Angeles premiere to take pictures and videos with the cast and crew in real time for China, the first time the company has partnered with a foreign studio for this type of engagement.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Theatrical ===\nBlack Panther had its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles on January 29, 2018. The premiere featured a purple carpet that was flanked by women dressed as the Dora Milaje, while Coogler, cast members, and other guests wore African clothing at the request of Marvel for attendees to wear \"royal attire\", honoring the African setting of the film. Ahead of the premiere screening, Coogler received an extended standing ovation before he announced the cast of the film. Black Panther was released in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and Taiwan on February 13, in South Korea on February 14, and the United States on February 16. In the United States, the film opened in 4,020 theaters, with over 3,200 of those in 3D, 404 in IMAX, over 660 in premium large format, and over 200 D-Box locations. In addition, Black Panther was the first MCU film to be converted to ScreenX, a 270-degree wraparound format, that played in over 101 locations in eight countries. The film opened in most markets in its first weekend of release including a \"cross-nation release\" in Africa, a first for a Disney film. Black Panther was originally scheduled for release on November 3, 2017, before moving to July 6, 2018 to accommodate Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017). It was then moved to the final February date to accommodate Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018). Black Panther is part of Phase Three of the MCU.When Black Panther premiered in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on April 18, 2018, it was the first public film viewing after a nearly-30-year-old ban on cinemas was rescinded in December 2017. The premiere took place in a cinema owned by AMC Theatres in the King Abdullah Financial District of Riyadh. Disney's regional distributor, Italia Film, said 40 seconds of the film had been removed, which was in line with cuts made to the film across the region. Awwad Alawwad, Saudi Arabia's Minister of Culture and Information, and Adam Aron, CEO of AMC Entertainment, were in attendance for the premiere along with other diplomats and industry experts; no one from the cast or production team was in attendance. Black Panther screened there for five days before Avengers: Infinity War premiered on April 26.Black Panther returned to 250 AMC Theatres in the United States from February 1 until February 7, 2019, for free, with two showings of the film occurring at each theater for the week. The week-long return was in honor of the start of Black History Month and the film winning two Screen Actors Guild Awards and earning an Academy Award Best Picture nomination. Disney also gave a $1.5 million grant to the United Negro College Fund.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nBlack Panther was released for digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on May 8, 2018, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on May 15, 2018. The digital and Blu-ray releases included several bonus features: behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, a blooper reel, an exclusive look at Ant-Man and the Wasp, and a featurette on the first ten years of the MCU.As of November 11, 2018, the film's Blu-ray and DVD releases have sold 4.2 million units and grossed $87 million in the United States, making it the best-selling film of 2018.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nBlack Panther grossed $700.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $646.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.347 billion. It became the highest-grossing solo superhero film, the third-highest-grossing film of the MCU and superhero film overall, the ninth-highest-grossing film of all time, and the highest-grossing film by a black director. It is the fifth MCU film and 33rd overall to surpass $1 billion, and the second-highest-grossing film of 2018. Deadline Hollywood estimated the net profit of the film to be $476.8 million, accounting for production budgets, P&A, talent participations and other costs, with box office grosses and ancillary revenues from home media, placing it second on their list of 2018's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".\n\n\n==== Pre-sale tickets ====\nThe film had the fourth-highest pre-sale tickets sold on Fandango, and became the top pre-seller for a superhero film and for a film released in February as well as the first quarter of a year. The first 24 hours of ticket pre-sales on the site were the largest for a Marvel film. Black Panther also had the highest number of ticket pre-sales for any superhero film at Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, while out-selling all previous Marvel films at AMC Theatres, and having strong pre-sales at Atom Tickets. Four days before its United States opening, IMAX Entertainment CEO Greg Foster revealed that Black Panther had the most advanced IMAX ticket sales of any Marvel film, which did not appear to have peaked 10 days before opening as with most films; Black Panther, he said, \"feels like it's going to peak the day it opens\". Fandango's pre-sales ultimately accounted for 30% of the film's United States and Canada opening weekend gross, one of the largest box office shares for any film in Fandango's history.\n\n\n==== United States and Canada ====\nEarly projections for Black Panther's opening weekend ranged from $80\u2013170 million, with rival film studios projecting the total to be as high as $180\u2013200 million; Disney projected the gross to be around $150 million. It ultimately earned $75.8 million on its opening day (including $25.2 million from Thursday night previews), and $242.1 million over the four-day Presidents' Day weekend. This was the best Presidents' Day weekend opening, and the best opening weekend for a black director and predominantly black cast. For AMC Theatres, Black Panther became the highest-grossing film ever at 33 locations, and had the biggest opening weekend for 150 of them. Overall, this was the second-largest opening weekend ever for the chain with 4.4 million admissions. Atom Tickets sold more tickets for Black Panther than any other superhero film. Anthony D'Alessandro of Deadline Hollywood described the success as \"summer box office records during the second month of the year\".The week after its opening weekend was also strong, with a record-setting Tuesday and Thursday earnings, becoming the MCU film with the highest first-week gross. It also surpassed $300 million in eight days, becoming the fastest MCU film to do so. In its second weekend, the film earned $112 million, which was a 45 percent decrease from its opening week, the smallest decline in a second weekend for any MCU film. It was the second-best second weekend ever, and the best second weekend for a Marvel film beating The Avengers ($103 million). Black Panther also became the highest-grossing film released in February, surpassing The Passion of the Christ (2004) ($370.3 million).Black Panther was the first film to hold the number one spot at the box office for at least five weekends since Avatar (2009), and the first February release to hold the top box office spot for five weekends since Wayne's World in 1992. The film declined over subsequent weekends, but remained in the top ten through its tenth. In its eleventh weekend, the film rose back up at the box office, in part because of the release of Avengers: Infinity War the same weekend, and the following weekend it earned $3.14 million from over 1,600 locations. D'Alessandro noted the gross from that number of locations indicated people were continuing to see Black Panther in conjunction with Infinity War. Black Panther was in the top ten again in its thirteenth weekend.In its 25th weekend, Disney increased the film's theater count from 10 to 25 to help the film become the third ever to surpass $700 million. Brian Gallagher of IGN felt the film surpassing $700 million was more impressive than Infinity War's $2.045 billion worldwide gross at the time. Gallagher pointed to Black Panther being more consistent each week, never having more than a 50% weekend decrease until the 15th frame while Infinity War dropped 55% in its second weekend, its February release date without any major competition from other films, and the fact it was \"a rallying cry for diversity and representation\". Black Panther is the highest-grossing film of 2018 and became the third-highest-grossing film of all time, as well as the highest-grossing superhero film. Its IMAX total of $36 million is the most for any MCU film. In July 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic closing most theaters worldwide and limiting what films played, Black Panther returned to 421 theaters (mostly drive-ins) and grossed $367,000, the second-highest for the weekend behind a re-release of The Empire Strikes Back (1980).\n\n\n==== Other territories ====\nOutside the United States and Canada, the film opened in 48 territories in its first weekend and earned $184 million, opening at number one in most territories (though second in some where Fifty Shades Freed performed better, such as Germany and Italy). It became the top February opening in many countries, including in the African market and the Middle East, while taking the top spot across Latin America. IMAX accounted for $11.5 million of the opening weekend gross, from 272 screens, which included record opening weekends in the format for Nigeria, Kenya, and Indonesia. In its second weekend, in 55 territories, the film earned $83.5 million and remained number one in most, including across Latin America, while becoming the top film in Germany. The West Africa region saw a 7% increase, which resulted in the biggest three-day weekend ever there. Trinidad had the biggest opening weekend ever ($700,000) and the IMAX release in Russia ($1.7 million) was a February record for that country.In its third weekend, the film remained number one across many of its 56 territories, including the entire Latin America region, while its opening in Japan was the top Western film for the weekend, the second overall. In its fourth weekend, Black Panther opened in China ($66.5 million) with the fourth-highest MCU and superhero opening ever in the country. This included the biggest opening day and opening weekend ($7.3 million) of March for IMAX in China. The film also remained at number one in the United Kingdom and the Latin America region (except Argentina) for the fourth straight weekend, as well as number one in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Black Panther was the top film in South Africa for seven weeks, where it became the highest-grossing film ever. It also became the highest-grossing film of all time in West and East Africa, and the southern Africa region, and the highest-grossing superhero film ever in the Netherlands. As of April 8, 2018, the film's largest markets were China ($104.6 million), the United Kingdom ($67.7 million), and South Korea ($42.8 million). It became the fifth-highest-grossing MCU film of all time in other territories.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 96% with an average score of 8.27/10, based on 505 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Black Panther elevates superhero cinema to thrilling new heights while telling one of the MCU's most absorbing stories\u2014and introducing some of its most fully realized characters.\" As of February 18, 2018, it was the best-reviewed live-action superhero film on the site, beating The Dark Knight (2008) and Iron Man (both 94%). Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 88 out of 100, based on 55 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A+\" on an A+ to F scale, the second live-action superhero film to receive that grade after Marvel's The Avengers. Filmgoers polled by comScore's PostTrak service gave the film a 95% positive score and an 88% \"definite recommend\", with a third of people planning to see the film again. RelishMix reported that the use of Twitter hashtags for #BlackPanther and tagging of the film's Twitter account from those leaving the theater was the highest for a film's opening weekend, with 559,000 unique posts in one day (100,000 posts for a film is average). Black Panther was listed on many critics' top ten lists as a top film of 2018.Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter highlighted the actors in the film, feeling that Boseman \"certainly holds his own, but there are quite a few charismatic supporting players\" including Jordan, Nyong'o, and Wright. Peter Debruge at Variety said the film was one of the best standalone Marvel films so far, and that it \"celebrates its hero's heritage\". Writing for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called Black Panther \"a jolt of a movie\", and praised it as an \"emblem of a past that was denied and a future that feels very present\" due to its focus on black imagination, creation, and liberation. At the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan praised the themes of the film and their exploration of what wealthy countries owe to the poor and oppressed, and noted that the film \"draws energy from Coogler's sense of excitement at all he's attempting\", saying that the film was worth seeing twice which he felt was rare for a modern superhero film. Richard Roeper, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, called the film \"one of the best superhero movies of the century\" and said audiences should watch the film if they appreciate \"finely honed storytelling with a Shakespearean core; winning performances from an enormously talented ensemble; provocative premises touching on isolationism, revolution and cultures of oppression, and oh yeah, tons of whiz-bang action sequences and good humor\". Brian Truitt of USA Today awarded the film four out of four stars, and called it Marvel Studios' best origin film since Guardians of the Galaxy. Truitt also praised the \"superb cast\" and stated, \"While the themes are deep, Black Panther is at the same time a visual joy to behold, with confident quirkiness, insane action sequences and special effects, and the glorious reveal of Wakanda\".Also giving the film four stars, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called it unlike any other Marvel film, \"an exhilarating triumph on every level from writing, directing, acting, production design, costumes, music, special effects to you name it\". Natasha Alford of The Grio called the film a \"movement, a revolution in progress, and a joy to experience all wrapped into one\", and called it \"a master class in what it means to be proud of who you are\". Jamie Broadnax of Black Girl Nerds called the film a masterpiece that is \"afro-futuristic and Blackity-black as hell. It's everything I've ever desired in a live-action version of this popular superhero and yet so much more.\" Jamelle Bouie of Slate said, \"it is fair to say that Black Panther is the most political movie ever produced by Marvel Studios, both in its very existence... and in the questions its story raises.\" He added that the film should be included with Superman (1978), Spider-Man 2 (2004), and The Dark Knight as superhero films that do not \"transcend the genre as much as they embrace it in all its respects\". Bouie concluded, \"Black Panther could have been just another Marvel romp [but] Coogler and company had the power, and perhaps the responsibility, to do much more. And they did.\" Although praising the film itself and calling it a \"refreshing answer to the increasingly stale world of superhero cinema\", Devindra Hardawar at Engadget was critical of the CGI, notably the digital actors used, calling them \"weightless, ugly and, worst of all, incredibly distracting\". Hardawar felt two \"particularly disappointing\" CGI shots were when T'Challa flips over a car during the Korea chase, and when T'Challa and Killmonger punch each other as they fall within the vibranium mines.\n\n\n=== Analysis ===\n\n\n==== Cultural importance ====\n\nWriting for Time, Jamil Smith felt Black Panther would \"prove to Hollywood that African-American narratives have the power to generate profits from all audiences\", and described it as a resistance to \"a regressive cultural and political moment fueled in part by the white-nativist movement... Its themes challenge institutional bias, its characters take unsubtle digs at oppressors, and its narrative includes prismatic perspectives on black life and tradition.\" Discussing the film as a defining moment for black America in The New York Times Magazine, Carvell Wallace said that in contrast to earlier black superhero films, Black Panther \"is steeped very specifically and purposefully in its blackness\". He felt Wakanda would become a \"promised land\" for future generations of black Americans, \"untroubled by the criminal horrors of our [current] American existence.\" Historian Nathan D. B. Connolly said Black Panther was \"a powerful fictional analogy for real-life struggles\" that taps into a \"500-year history of African-descended people imagining freedom, land and national autonomy.\" Connolly also felt, culturally, the film would be this generation's A Raisin in the Sun (1961). Writer and activist Shaun King found the film to be a cultural moment in American black history similar to Rosa Parks' Montgomery bus boycott, Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech, or Barack Obama being elected president.By contrast, James Wilt, writing for Canadian Dimension, stated that \"at its core, Black Panther contains a fundamentally reactionary understanding of black liberation that blatantly advocates respectability politics over revolution\" allowing \"white folks such as myself to feel extremely comfortable watching it\". Wilt found the scene where Ross is portrayed as \"the hero\" for shooting down the Wakandan ships to be the film's way of approving the vanquishing of armed resistance against oppression. Wilt also felt that Killmonger was given the \"most hideous traits imaginable [making] the only major African-American character and agitator for revolution a manic killer consumed by rage and violence\". Russell Rickford of Africa is a Country wrote that Killmonger's role as a character is \"to discredit radical internationalism\". Faisal Kutty from Middle East Eye felt the film had underlying Islamophobic themes, with the only Islamic characters being a Boko Haram-based group that kidnapped several girls and forced them to wear hijab.Science & Entertainment Exchange Director for the National Academy of Sciences Richard Loverd felt the film would increase interest in science, technology, and Africa for young black Americans, similarly to how The Hunger Games films and Brave (2012) sparked girls' interest in archery. Broadnax felt many people who generally do not watch comic book films would go to Black Panther since \"they're going to see themselves reflected in a huge way that they just haven't been able to see before\", especially since the film avoided the plight typically depicted in films about the black experience. She also stated that the strong female characters, such as Shuri, would be an inspiration for girls.Gil Robertson, co-founder and president of the African American Film Critics Association, called the film \"critically important\" and \"a gate-opener opportunity for other black-centered projects\". Child development expert Deborah Gilboa felt the film would make a huge impact on children's spirits by offering positive role models. Scholar Marlene D. Allen felt the saying \"if you can see it, you can be it\" applied to the film, especially with the female characters in the film. Allen felt the women of Wakanda \"are the very definition of 'Black Girl Magic', a term coined by CaShawn Thompson in 2013 'to celebrate the beauty, power, and resilience of Black women.'\" Tre Johnson of Rolling Stone felt that \"after decades of trying to nail the modern black superhero, we may finally be getting what we've asked for\", with Johnson saying Black Panther felt different from the Blaxploitation films of the 1970s and the \"Blaxploitation-lite\" attempts at black superhero films in the 1990s and 2000s because it was \"respectable, imaginative and powerful\", setting \"a new direction\" for the depiction of black superheroes. In the film's opening weekend, 37% of audiences in the United States were African-American, according to PostTrak, compared to 35% Caucasian, 18% Hispanic, and 5% Asian. This was the most diverse audience for a superhero film ever (African-Americans generally make up 15% of audiences for superhero films). In its second weekend, demographics were 37% Caucasian, 33% African American, 18% Hispanic and 7% Asian.In early January 2018, philanthropist Frederick Joseph created a GoFundMe drive to raise money for children of color at the Boys & Girls Club in Harlem to see Black Panther. Joseph said the film was a \"rare opportunity\" for underserved children of color to see \"a black major ... comic book character\" brought to film. Joseph promoted the drive with Boseman on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. The drive went on to raise over $45,000, exceeding its goal, with the money also funding other programs for children in Harlem. Joseph also started the \"Black Panther Challenge\" where he encouraged other people to create similar drives for their communities. GoFundMe made a centralized site for those wishing to start a drive for the challenge. 400 additional drives were started around the world, and the overall drive became the largest GoFundMe in history for an entertainment event, raising over $400,000. Many celebrities offered their support and contributions to the drives, including Ellen DeGeneres, Snoop Dogg, Chelsea Clinton, J. J. Abrams, Octavia Spencer, and British actress Jade Anouka.In June 2018, the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of African American History and Culture announced they had acquired several items from the film for their collection, including Boseman's Black Panther costume and a shooting script for the film signed by Coogler, Feige, Moore, and Cole. The museum said that the collection provides a \"fuller story of black culture and identity\" by showing the progression of black Americans in film, \"an industry that [once] regulated them to flat, one-dimensional and marginalized figures.\" In conjunction with The Hollywood Reporter's Women in Entertainment Mentorship Program, and its partner the Greater Los Angeles chapter of Big Brothers Big Sisters, Walt Disney Studios created \"The Black Panther Scholarship\", worth US$250,000 to Loyola Marymount University. Boseman, Nyong'o, and Gurira presented the scholarship to its first recipient at The Hollywood Reporter's 2018 Women in Entertainment event in early December 2018.\n\n\n==== African and African-American representation ====\nDwayne Wong (Omowale) writing in HuffPost saw the film and its comic origins as addressing \"serious political issues concerning Africa's relationship to the West that is very rarely given the serious attention that it deserves\", with Wakandans portrayed as suspicious towards outsiders. He concluded that while the country is fictional, the politics \"are very real. The end of colonialism did not end Western tampering in Africa's politics\". Carlos Rosario Gonzalez of Bam! Smack! Pow! said the struggle between T'Challa and Killmonger represents the collision of \"what it means to be African\" and \"what Africa means to Afro-minorities today\". In this view, Wakanda represents Africa without Western colonialism, and Killmonger shows us that \"we can sometimes inevitably become what we seek to destroy,\" concluding that Killmonger wants to use Wakanda's resources to become a colonizer of the West while \"Wakanda's conservative ways created the very problem that sought to destroy them, Erik Killmonger\". Jelani Cobb, writing in The New Yorker, discussed the divide between Africans and African Americans, which he called a \"fundamental dissonance\". He felt T'Challa and Killmonger represented \"dueling responses to five centuries of African exploitation at the hands of the West. The villain, to the extent that the term applies, is history itself\". Cobb added that Black Panther is political in a way previous MCU films were not because in those \"we were at least clear about where the lines of fantasy departed from reality [while this film is set in] in an invented nation in Africa, a continent that has been grappling with invented versions of itself ever since white men first declared it the 'dark continent' and set about plundering its people and its resources.\" Writing for The Atlantic, Adam Serwer argued against the assertion that Erik Killmonger was a representation for black liberation, positing instead that he represented imperialism. He felt that this was emphasized through his actions, as Killmonger's attempts to take over several of the world's major cities notably include Hong Kong. Since China does not have a white Western hegemony in need of overthrowing, Killmonger's desire to conquer China was purely for the sake of power. Ultimately, he argues that \"Black Panther does not render a verdict that violence is an unacceptable tool of black liberation\u2014to the contrary, that is precisely how Wakanda is liberated. It renders a verdict on imperialism as a tool of black liberation, to say that the master's tools cannot dismantle the master's house.\"Patrick Gathara, writing in The Washington Post, described the film as offering a \"regressive, neocolonial vision of Africa\", which\u2014rather than a \"redemptive counter-mythology\"\u2014offers \"the same destructive myths\". Gathara highlighted the Africa that is portrayed, still essentially a European creation, as being divided and tribalized, with Wakanda run by a wealthy and feuding elite that despite its advanced technical abilities does not have a means of succession beyond lethal combat. The Wakandans \"still cleanly fit into the Western molds [of] a dark people in a dark continent\" according to Gathara, and they \"remain so remarkably unsophisticated that a 'returning' American can basically stroll in and take over ... [The film] should not be mistaken for an attempt at liberating Africa from Europe. Quite the opposite. Its 'redemptive counter-mythology' entrenches the tropes that have been used to dehumanize Africans for centuries.\" Christopher Lebron, in a piece for Boston Review, called the film racist because it depicts black Americans who had been left in poverty and oppression, as exemplified by Killmonger, as still being \"relegated to the lowest rung of political regard\" in the film, treated as less deserving of empathy and less capable of their acts being deemed heroic, than even Ross' white spy. Lebron felt that T'Challa could have shown himself a good person by understanding how Killmonger was affected by American racism and T'Chaka's \"cruelty\", and could have agreed that justice sometimes requires violence as a last resort against oppression. He summed up by commenting that \"In 2018, a world home to both the Movement for Black Lives and a president [Donald Trump] who identifies white supremacists as fine people, we are given a movie about black empowerment where the only redeemed blacks are African nobles [who] safeguard virtue and goodness against the threat not of white Americans or Europeans, but a black American\".\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\nBlack Panther was nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture (winning three), one American Music Award (won), nine BET Awards (winning two), one Billboard Music Award, one British Academy Film Award (won), twelve Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning three), three Golden Globe Awards, eight Grammy Awards (winning two), seven MTV Movie & TV Awards (winning four), one MTV Video Music Award (won), sixteen NAACP Image Awards (winning ten), five People's Choice Awards (winning two), fourteen Saturn Awards (winning five), two Screen Actors Guild Awards (winning both), and eleven Teen Choice Awards (winning three), among others. Its nominations for the Academy Award for Best Picture and Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama were firsts for a superhero film, while its Academy Award wins were the first for Marvel Studios and an MCU film. Black Panther was named one of the ten best films of 2018 by the National Board of Review as well as one of the ten best films of 2018 by the American Film Institute. The film was the top entertainment Google search of 2018 along with the sixth overall.\n\n\n==== Oscars campaign ====\nBy late August 2018, Disney hired Academy Award campaign strategist Cynthia Swartz to create a nomination campaign on behalf of the film for the 91st Academy Awards, with Feige and Marvel Studios said to have given the film a noteworthy budget for the awards season, an obligation which Marvel didn't consider for previous films. The campaign was focused to highlight \"the film's creative accomplishments and the global impact it made\" in the hopes of receiving a Best Picture nomination; the campaign was not altered with the announcement of the new Best Popular Film award, which appeared to be \"designed to reward blockbusters like Black Panther\" in the event they did not receive a best picture nomination. The Best Popular Film award was ultimately not implemented for the 91st Academy Awards, in order for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to \"examine and seek additional input regarding\" it. Glenn Whipp of the Los Angeles Times felt the \"blueprint\" for the film's best picture campaign was to \"communicate to Oscar voters that this is an auteur-driven superhero movie possessing a deep significance both to its director and to people historically underrepresented in Hollywood films.\" Another Oscar campaign consultant felt reminding the Oscar voters Black Panther \"wasn't just a movie, it was a phenomenon\" would help the film earn a nomination. Another said voters \"want to reward good movies and they also want to reward movies that say something significant and make the industry look good.\" The consultants also felt if Black Panther could earn multiple nominations in the craft award categories, it would bolster its chances for a best picture nomination; Whipp believed that Morrison, Beachler, Carter, Friend and Harlow, and Lamar all had the possibility to be nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and Best Original Song, respectively. A few weeks later, Disney revealed their For Your Consideration list, with consideration in all Awards of Merit categories, aside from Best Actress and categories it was not eligible for, such as those for animation, short films, and documentaries.Black Panther was ultimately nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, Best Original Score, Best Original Song (for \"All the Stars\"), Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing. The film was the first superhero film ever to be nominated for Best Picture, while Beachler's nomination for Best Production Design was the first for an African American. Feige called the best picture nomination \"the highest form of recognition from our peers\". On her nomination, Beachler said she felt \"a certain responsibility. It means breaking down walls ... for young women of color and boys and girls of color to see that this is not impossible.\"\n\n\n== Sequel ==\n\nWith the release of Black Panther, Feige said \"there are many, many stories to tell\" about the character, and that he wanted Coogler to return for any potential sequel. Coogler added that he wanted to see how T'Challa would grow as a king in future films, since his reign only began recently in the MCU, while in the comics, he has been king since childhood. In March 2018, Feige added there was \"nothing specific to reveal\" in terms of a sequel, but that there \"absolutely\" were \"ideas and a pretty solid direction on where we want to head with the second one\". By October 2018, Coogler had completed a deal to write and direct a sequel to Black Panther. The next month, Coogler said that, while he was feeling pressure while developing the sequel due to Black Panther's success, he would \"focus on trying to make something that has some type of meaning\" for the film. In June 2019, Feige confirmed that work on the script had begun, and the next month confirmed the film was in development. In August 2020, following the death of Boseman from colon cancer, Coogler stated he had been unaware of Boseman's illness, and had \"spent the last year preparing, imagining and writing words for him to say [in the sequel], that we weren't destined to see\". Feige and other executives at Marvel Studios involved on the Black Panther films were also unaware of Boseman's illness. Boseman, who had become thinner from his illness in the weeks prior to his death, had been prepared to begin gaining the weight back for the film in September 2020. Prior to Boseman's death, filming was expected to begin in March 2021. Wright, Gurira, and Freeman will reprise their roles in the film, which is scheduled for release on May 6, 2022.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAfrofuturism in film\nList of black film box office receipts\nList of black films of the 2010s\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nBlack Panther on IMDb",

He was ruler of the whole Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from 23 September 1932 to 9 November 1953 but ruled parts of it as early as 1902.\nHe reconquered his family's ancestral home city of Riyadh in 1902, starting three decades of conquests that made him the ruler of nearly all of central and north Arabia. He consolidated his control over the Najd in 1922, then conquered the Hejaz in 1925. He extended his dominions into what later became the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932. As King, he presided over the discovery of petroleum in Saudi Arabia in 1938 and the beginning of large-scale oil production after World War II. He fathered many children, including 45 sons, and all of the subsequent kings of Saudi Arabia through at least the year 2020.\n\n\n== Early life and family origins ==\nIbn Saud was born on 15 January 1875 in Riyadh in the region called Najd in central Arabia. He was the son of Abdul Rahman bin Faisal, last ruler of the Emirate of Nejd, the \"Second Saudi State\", a tribal sheikhdom centered on Riyadh. Ibn Saud's mother was a member of the Sudairi family, Sara bint Ahmed Al Sudairi. She died in 1910. His full-siblings were Faisal, Noura, Bazza, Haya and Saad.His family, the House of Saud, had been a power in central Arabia for the previous 130 years. Under the influence and inspiration of Wahhabi Islam, the Saudis had previously attempted to control much of the Arabian peninsula in the form of the Emirate of Diriyah, the \"First Saudi State\", until its destruction by an Ottoman army in the Ottoman\u2013Wahhabi War in the early nineteenth century.In 1890, the House of Saud's long-term regional rivals, the Rashidis, conquered Riyadh. Ibn Saud was 15 at the time. He and his family initially took refuge with the Al Murrah, a Bedouin tribe in the southern desert of Arabia. Later, the Al Sauds moved to Qatar and stayed there for two months. Their next stop was Bahrain, where they stayed briefly. The Ottoman State allowed them to settle in Kuwait, and they settled there where they lived for nearly a decade.In the spring of 1901, Ibn Saud and some relatives, including a half-brother, Mohammad, and several cousins, set out on a raiding expedition into the Najd, targeting mainly tribes associated with the Rashidis. As the raid proved profitable, it attracted more participants. The raiders' numbers peaked at over 200, but numbers dwindled over the ensuing months.In the autumn, the group made camp in the Yabrin oasis. While observing Ramadan, he decided to attack Riyadh and retake it from the Al Rashid. On the night of 15 January 1902, he led 40 men over the walls of the city on tilted palm trees and took the city. The Rashidi governor of the city, Ajlan, was killed in front of his own fortress. The Saudi recapture of the city marked the beginning of the Third Saudi State.\n\n\n== Rise to power ==\n\nFollowing the capture of Riyadh, many former supporters of the House of Saud rallied to Ibn Saud's call to arms. He was a charismatic leader and kept his men supplied with arms. Over the next two years, he and his forces recaptured almost half of the Najd from the Rashidis.\nIn 1904, Abdulaziz of Al Rashid (a.k.a. Ibn Rashid) appealed to the Ottoman Empire for military protection and assistance. The Ottomans responded by sending troops into Arabia. On 15 June 1904, Ibn Saud's forces suffered a major defeat at the hands of the combined Ottoman and Rashidi forces. His forces regrouped and began to wage guerrilla warfare against the Ottomans. Over the next two years, he was able to disrupt their supply routes, forcing them to retreat. The victory of Ibn Saud in Rawdat Muhanna, in which Ibn Rashid died, ended the Ottoman presence in Najd and Qassim by the end of October 1906.\nHe completed his conquest of the Najd and the eastern coast of Arabia in 1912. He then founded the Ikhwan, a military-religious brotherhood, which was to assist in his later conquests, with the approval of local Salafi ulema. In the same year, he instituted an agrarian policy to settle the nomadic pastoralist Bedouins into colonies and to replace their tribal organizations with allegiance to the Ikhwan.\nDuring World War I, the British government established diplomatic relations with Ibn Saud. The British agent, Captain William Shakespear, was well received by the Bedouin. Similar diplomatic missions were established with any Arabian power who might have been able to unify and stabilize the region. The British entered into the Treaty of Darin in December 1915, which made the lands of the House of Saud a British protectorate and attempted to define the boundaries of the developing Saudi state. In exchange, Ibn Saud pledged to again make war against Ibn Rashid, who was an ally of the Ottomans.\nThe British Foreign Office had previously begun to support Sharif Hussein bin Ali, Emir of the Hejaz by sending T. E. Lawrence (a.k.a. Lawrence of Arabia) to him in 1915. The Saudi Ikhwan began to conflict with Hussein, Sharif of Mecca also in 1917, just as his sons Abdullah and Faisal entered Damascus. The Treaty of Darin remained in effect until superseded by the Jeddah conference of 1927 and the Dammam conference of 1952, during both of which Ibn Saud extended his boundaries past the Anglo-Ottoman Blue Line. After Darin, he stockpiled the weapons and supplies which the British provided him, including a 'tribute' of \u00a35,000 per month. After World War I, he received further support from the British, including a glut of surplus munitions. He launched his campaign against the Al Rashidi in 1920; by 1922 they had been all but destroyed.\nThe defeat of the Al Rashidi doubled the size of Saudi territory because, after the war of Ha'il, Ibn Saud sent his army to occupy Al-Jouf and the army led by Eqab bin Mohaya, the head of Talhah tribe. This allowed Ibn Saud the leverage to negotiate a new and more favorable treaty with the British. Their treaty, signed at Uqair in 1922, where he met Percy Cox, British High Commissioner in Iraq, to draw boundaries saw Britain recognize many of his territorial gains. In exchange, Ibn Saud agreed to recognize British territories in the area, particularly along the Persian Gulf coast and in Iraq. The former of these were vital to the British, as merchant traffic between British India and the United Kingdom depended upon coaling stations on the approach to the Suez Canal.\nIn 1925, Ibn Saud's forces captured the holy city of Mecca from Sharif Hussein, ending 700 years of Hashemite rule. On 8 January 1926, the leading figures in Mecca, Madina and Jeddah proclaimed Ibn Saud the King of Hejaz. He raised Najd to a kingdom as well on 29 January 1927. On 20 May 1927, the British government signed the Treaty of Jeddah, which abolished the Darin protection agreement and recognized the independence of the Hejaz and Najd, with Ibn Saud as their ruler. For the next five years, Ibn Saud administered the two parts of his dual kingdom as separate units.\nWith international recognition and support, Ibn Saud continued to consolidate his power. By 1927, his forces had overrun most of the central Arabian Peninsula, but the alliance between the Ikhwan and the Al Saud collapsed when Ibn Saud forbade further raiding. The few portions of central Arabia that had not been overrun by the Saudi-Ikhwan forces had treaties with London, and Ibn Saud was sober enough to see the folly of provoking the British by pushing into these areas. This did not sit well with the Ikhwan, who had been taught that all non-Wahhabis were infidels. Tensions finally boiled over when the Ikhwan rebelled. After two years of fighting, they were suppressed by Ibn Saud in the Battle of Sabilla in March 1929.On 23 September 1932, Ibn Saud formally united his realm into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with himself as its king. He transferred his court to Murabba Palace from the Masmak Fort in 1938 and the palace remained his residence and the seat of government until his death in 1953.Ibn Saud had to first eliminate the right of his own father in order to rule, and then distance and contain the ambitions of his five brothers, particularly his oldest brother, Muhammad, who had fought with him during the battles and conquests that gave birth to the state.\n\n\n== Oil discovery and his rule ==\n\nPetroleum was discovered in Saudi Arabia in 1938 by American geologists working for Standard Oil Company of New York (SOCONY) in partnership with Saudi officials. Through his advisers St John Philby and Ameen Rihani, Ibn Saud granted substantial authority over Saudi oil fields to American oil companies in 1944. Beginning in 1915, he signed the \"friendship and cooperation\" pact with Britain to keep his militia in line and cease any further attacks against their protectorates for whom they were responsible.\nHis newfound oil wealth brought with it a great deal of power and influence that Ibn Saud would use to advantage in the Hijaz. He forced many nomadic tribes to settle down and abandon \"petty wars\" and vendettas. He also began widespread enforcement of the new kingdom's ideology, based on the teachings of Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab. This included an end to traditionally sanctioned rites of pilgrimage, recognized by the orthodox schools of jurisprudence, but at odds with those sanctioned by Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab. In 1926, after a caravan of Egyptians on the way to Mecca were beaten by his forces for playing bugles, he was impelled to issue a conciliatory statement to the Egyptian government. In fact, several such statements were issued to Muslim governments around the world as a result of beatings suffered by the pilgrims visiting the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. With the uprising and subsequent decimation thereafter of the Ikhwan in 1929 via British air power, the 1930s marked a turning point. With his rivals eliminated, Ibn Saud's ideology was in full force, ending nearly 1400 years of accepted religious practices surrounding the Hajj, the majority of which were sanctioned by a millennium of scholarship.\nIbn Saud established a Shura Council of the Hijaz as early as 1927. This Council was later expanded to 20 members, and was chaired by the king's son, Faisal.\n\n\n== Foreign wars ==\nIbn Saud was able to gain loyalty from tribes near Saudi Arabia, tribes such as those in Jordan. For example, he built very strong ties with Prince Rashed Al-Khuzai from the Al Fraihat tribe, one of the most influential and royally established families during the Ottoman Empire. The Prince and his tribe had dominated eastern Jordan before the arrival of Sharif Hussein. Ibn Saud supported Prince Rashed and his followers in rebellion against Hussein.Prince Rashed supported Izz ad-Din al-Qassam's defiance in 1935 which led him and his followers in rebellion against Abdullah I of Jordan. In 1937, when they were forced to leave Jordan, Prince Rashed Al Khuzai, his family, and a group of his followers chose to move to Saudi Arabia, where Prince Rashedi lived for several years in Ibn Saud's hospitality.\n\n\n== Later years ==\n\nIbn Saud positioned Saudi Arabia as neutral in World War II, but was generally considered to favor the Allies. However, in 1938, when an attack on a main British pipeline in the Kingdom of Iraq was found to be connected to the German Ambassador, Fritz Grobba, Ibn Saud provided Grobba with refuge. It was reported that he had been disfavoring the British as of 1937.In the last stage of the war, Ibn Saud met significant political figures. One of these meetings, which lasted for three days, was with U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt on 14 February 1945. The meeting took place on board USS Quincy in the Great Bitter Lake segment of the Suez Canal. The meeting laid down the basis of the future relations between the two countries.The other meeting was with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in the Grand Hotel du Lac on the shores of the Fayyoun Oasis, fifty miles south of Cairo, in February 1945. Saudis report that the meeting heavily focused on the Palestine problem and was unproductive in terms of its outcomes, in contrast to that with Roosevelt.In 1948, Ibn Saud participated in the Arab-Israeli War, but Saudi Arabia's contribution was generally considered token.Following the naming of Prince Saud as his heir Ibn Saud left most of his duties to him, and he spent most of his time in Ta'if.While most of the royal family desired luxuries such as gardens, splendid cars, and palaces, Ibn Saud wanted a royal railway from the Persian Gulf to Riyadh and then an extension to Jeddah. This was regarded by all of his advisers living in the country as an old man's folly. Eventually, ARAMCO built the railway, at a cost of $70 million, drawn from the King's oil royalties. It was completed in 1951 and was used commercially after the king's death. It enabled Riyadh to grow into a relatively modern city. But when a paved road was built in 1962, the railway lost its traffic.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nIn accordance with the customs of his people, Ibn Saud headed a polygamous household comprising several wives and concubines. According to some sources, he had twenty-two consorts. Mohammed Leopold Weiss reported in 1929 that one of his spouses poisoned him in 1924 which caused poor sight of one eye. He later forgave her, but at the same time divorced her. On the other hand, many of his marriages were contracted in order to cement alliances with other clans, during the period when the Saudi state was founded and stabilized. He was the father of almost a hundred children, including forty-five sons. \nIbn Saud was a tall man standing between 1.93 m (6 ft 4 in) and 1.98 m (6 ft 6 in).\n\n\n=== Relations with family members ===\nIbn Saud was said to be very close to his paternal aunt, Jawhara bint Faisal. From a young age, she ingrained in him a strong sense of family destiny and motivated him to regain the lost glory of the House of Saud. During the years when the Saud family were living almost as refugees in Kuwait, Jawhara bint Faisal frequently recounted the deeds of his ancestors to Abdulaziz and exhorted him not to be content with the existing situation. She was instrumental in making him decide to return to Najd from Kuwait and regain the territories of his family. She was well educated in Islam, in Arab custom and in tribal and clan relationships. She remained among the king's most trusted and influential advisors all her life. Ibn Saud asked her about the experiences of past rulers and the historical allegiance and the roles of tribes and individuals. Jawhara was also deeply respected by the king's children. Ibn Saud visited her daily until she died around 1930.Ibn Saud was also very close to his sister Noura, who was one year older than him. On several occasions, he identified himself in public with the words: \"I am the brother of Noura.\" Noura died a few years before Ibn Saud.\n\n\n=== Assassination attempt ===\nOn 15 March 1935, three armed men attacked and tried to assassinate Ibn Saud during his performance of Hajj. He survived the attack unhurt and three assassins were arrested.\n\n\n=== Successor ===\nHe appointed his second son Prince Saud heir to the Saudi throne in 1933. He had many quarrels with his elder brother Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman as to who should be appointed heir. Muhammad wanted his son Khalid to be designated the heir. Ibn Saud's eldest son was Turki Al Awwal, who was the Crown Prince of the Kingdoms of Nejd and Hejaz, but Turki died at age 18, predeceasing his father, and his younger full-brother was appointed Crown Prince. Had Turki not died, he would have been the Crown Prince. Ibn Saud had 45 sons, of whom 36 survived to adulthood. Ten of his sons were capable enough to be candidates for the succession. They were Saud, Faisal, Muhammad, Khalid, Fahd, Abdullah, Sultan, Nayef, Salman and Muqrin. Of these ten, six became king. Muhammad, Sultan, Nayef and Muqrin were crown prince but never succeeded the throne. Muhammad resigned from the post, Sultan and Nayef predeceased King Abdullah, and Muqrin was removed from the post by his brother King Salman in April 2015.\n\n\n== Views ==\nIn regard to essential values for the state and people, he said, \"Two things are essential to our state and our people ... religion and the rights inherited from our fathers.\"Amani Hamdan argues that the attitude of Ibn Saud towards women's education was encouraging since he expressed his support in a conversation with St John Philby in which he stated, \"It is permissible for women to read.\"His last words to his two sons, the future King Saud and the next in line Prince Faisal, who were already battling each other, were \"You are brothers, unite!\" Shortly before his death, Ibn Saud stated, \"Verily, my children and my possessions are my enemies.\"\n\n\n== Death and funeral ==\nIbn Saud was experiencing heart disease in his final years, and he was half blind and racked by arthritis. In October 1953, his illness became serious. He died in his sleep of a heart attack at the palace of Prince Faisal in Ta'if on 9 November 1953 at the age of 78. Prince Faisal was at his side.Funeral prayer was performed at Al Hawiya in Ta'if. His body was brought to Riyadh where he was buried in Al Oud cemetery next to his sister, Noura.The US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles stated after Ibn Saud's death that he would be remembered for his achievements as a statesman.\n\n\n== Honors ==\nOn 23 November 1916 during the Three Leaders Conference in Kuwait Ibn Saud was given by Percy Cox the Star of India and the Order of the British Empire.Ibn Saud was appointed an honorary Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (GCIE) on 1 January 1920. He was awarded the British Order of the Bath (GCB) in 1935, the U.S. Legion of Merit in 1947 and the Spanish Order of Military Merit (with White Decoration) in 1952.\n\n\n== See also ==\nKing of the Sands (2012 film) \u2013 a biopic film on Ibn Saud directed by Najdat Anzour\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAn article on his marriages and children (in Arabic)\n \"Ibn Sa'ud\" .

        "wiki": "Ta'if (Arabic: \u0627\u064e\u0644\u0637\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0626\u0650\u0641\u064f\u200e, romanized: a\u1e6d-\u1e6c\u0101\u02beif, lit. 'The Pilgrim') is a city and governorate in the Makkah Province of Saudi Arabia. Located at an elevation of 1,879 m (6,165 ft) in the slopes of the Hejaz Mountains, which themselves are part of the Sarawat Mountains, the city has a 2020 estimated population of 688,693 people, making it the 6th most populous city in the kingdom.The origins of the name Ta'if are unclear, however, it is known that in the pre-Islamic Arabian age, Ta'if housed an idol of the goddess Lat, and was frequented by pilgrims, which could explain the name. Ta'if has been indirectly referred to in the Qur'an in verse 31 of Surah 43.[Quran 43:31] The city was visited by the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, sometime in the early 7th century and was inhabited by the tribe of Banu Thaqif and is still inhabited to this day by their descendants. As a part of the Hejaz, the city has seen many transfers-of-power throughout its history, with the last being during the Saudi conquest of Hejaz in 1925.\nThe city has been called the unofficial summer capital of Saudi Arabia and has also been called the best summer destination in Saudi Arabia as it enjoys a moderate weather during summer, unlike most of the Arabian Peninsula. The city owes its popularity among tourists to its many mountain resorts and moderate climate, even during the harsh summers of Arabia. The city is connected to the nearby resort town of al-Hada via the iconic Highway 15 (Ta'if\u2013al-Hada Road). It stands out from the rest of the Hejaz region as it is a city that plays an active role in the agricultural output of Saudi Arabia and is the center of an agricultural area known for its cultivation of grapes, pomegranate, figs, roses and honey. Ta'if is also very active in the manufacturing of traditional 'Ittar, and is known locally as the City of Roses (Arabic: \u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0631\u0648\u062f\u200e, romanized: Madinat al-Wurud). Ta'if also hosts the historic Souq 'Okaz\nThe Ta'if governorate is divided into 15 smaller municipalities, with Ta'if as the capital. The administration of the city itself is carried out by 5 municipalities, named North Ta'if, West Ta'if, East Ta'if, South Ta'if and New Ta'if. Ta'if is served by the Ta'if Regional Airport, with a new international airport planned to open sometime in 2020.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the 6th century CE, the city of T\u0101'if was dominated by the Thaqif tribe, which still lives in and around the city of Ta'if today. It has been suggested that Jewish tribes who were displaced by Ethiopian Christians in the Himyarite Kingdom wars settled near Ta'if. The walled city was a religious centre as it housed the idol of the goddess L\u0101t, who was then known as \"the lady of T\u0101'if.\" Its climate marked the city out from its dry and barren neighbours closer to the Red Sea. Wheat, vines, and fruit were grown around T\u0101'if, and this is how the city earned its title \"the Garden of the Hejaz\". Both Ta'if and Mecca were resorts of pilgrimage. Ta'if was more pleasantly situated than Mecca itself and the people of Ta'if had close trade relations with the people of Mecca. The people of Ta'if carried on agriculture and fruit\u2011growing in addition to their trade activities.In the early 7th century, Muhammad, who was born in Makkah, preached Islam to the inhabitants of Mecca and the Hijaz, and encountered resistance from many of the people there and even at Ta'if. In 630, the Battle of Hunayn took place at Hunayn, close to the city. Shortly after that, the unsuccessful Siege of Ta'if took place. The city was assaulted by catapults from Banu Daus, but it repelled the attacks. The Battle of Tabuk in 631 left T\u0101'if completely isolated, so members of Thaq\u012bf arrived in Makkah to negotiate the conversion of the city to Islam. The idol of L\u0101t was destroyed along with all other signs of the city's pagan past.The city then went through many exchanges-of-power, but most of the action within these conflicts took place between Makkah and Medina, and Ta'if dwindled in importance in contrast to the two holy cities.\n\n\n=== Under Ottoman rule ===\nOn 17 July 1517, the Sharif of Mecca capitulated to the Ottoman Sultan Selim I. As a sign of this, he surrendered to him the keys of the Islamic cities of Mecca and Medina. As part of the Hejaz, Ta'if was also given over to Ottoman control and the city remained Ottoman for a further three centuries, until in 1802, when it was retaken by rebels allied with the House of Saud. These forces then proceeded to take Mecca and Medina. The loss was keenly felt by the Ottoman Empire, which viewed itself as the protector of the Holy Cities. The Ottoman sultan, Mahmud II, called upon the Wali of Egypt, Muhammad Ali, who launched an attack on the Hejaz and reconquered Ta'if in 1813.\nIn 1813, the Swiss traveler and orientalist Johann Ludwig Burckhardt visited Ta'if and left an eyewitness account of the city just after its recapture by the Muhammad Ali, with whom he obtained several interviews while he was there. Burckhardt reported that the wall and ditch around the city had been built by Othman el-Medhayfe. There were three gates and several towers on the city walls, which, however, were weak, being in some places only 45 cm (18 in) thick. Burckhardt stated that the castle had been built by Sharif Ghalib ibn Musa'id. He noted the destruction of the city caused by the conquest of 1802. Most of the buildings were still in ruin while he was there, and the tomb of 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas \u2013 cousin of Muhammad and ancestor of the Abbasids \u2013 had been severely damaged. He also recorded that the population of the city was still mostly Thaq\u012bfi. In terms of trade, the city was an entrep\u00f4t for coffee.\nThe castle and military barracks in Ta'if were repaired by the Ottomans in 1843, a h\u00fck\u00fbmet kona\u011f\u0131 \u2013 mansion for government business \u2013 was built in 1869, and a post office was established sometime later.\n\n\n=== Arab Revolt ===\n\nPrior to the Arab Revolt, Ahmed Bey had been made the commander of Ottoman forces in T\u0101'if. He had under him a force of 3,000 soldiers and 10 pieces of mountain artillery. Ghalib Pasha, the governor of the Hejaz was also present in the city. In 1916, the Hashemites launched their revolt against the Ottoman Empire in Mecca in June. That city had fallen and then in July, Abdullah, the eldest son of the Hashemite leader and Sharif of Mecca Husayn ibn Ali, came with seventy men to T\u0101'if. Whilst his activities in the area aroused the suspicion of Ahmed Bey, Ghalib Pasha was unconcerned by so small a force. Abdullah secretly built up his army to 5,000 men. He then cut the telegraph wires to the city and took the offensive. All Hashemite assaults on the city were repelled by the mountain guns, and both sides settled down to an uneasy siege. However, Hashemite guns were slowly brought up to T\u0101'if, and then the city held out a little longer; before finally surrendering on 22 September. The city thus later became a part of the self-proclaimed Hashemite Kingdom of Hejaz.\n\n\n=== Saudi conquest and modern history ===\nTa'if did not remain in Hashemite hands for very long. Tensions between the King of the Hejaz, Husayn ibn Ali, and Abdulaziz al-Saud, the Emir of Nejd and Hasa, soon broke out into violence. Although hostilities subsided in 1919, by September 1924, the then Saudi-sponsored Ikhwan militia, under the leadership of Sultan bin Bajad and Khaled bin Luwai', was ready to attack Ta'if. The city was supposed to have been defended by the king's son, 'Ali, but he fled in panic with his troops. Three hundred of 'Ali's men were slain by the Ikhwan in what became known as the Ta'if massacre. In 1926, Abdulaziz al-Saud was officially recognized as the new King of Hejaz. Ta'if remained a part of the Kingdom of Hejaz until Abdulaziz al-Saud unified his two kingdoms and consolidated them into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932. In 1934 the treaty was signed here that established the boundary lines between Yemen and the kingdom. The king himself was later to die in the city on 9 November 1953, as did King Khalid on 13 June 1982.\nTa'if was still little more than a medieval city when the Saudis took control of it. However, they later embarked on a project of modernizing the city. Saudi Arabia's first public power generator was set up in Ta'if in the late 1940s. In terms of building roads to the isolated city, in 1965 the then King Faisal inaugurated the 54 mi (87 km) mountain highway between Mecca and Ta'if, now part of Highway 15 and known as the Taif\u2013al-Hada Road. In 1974, the approximately-650-kilometer Ta'if-Abha\u2013Jizan highway was commissioned part of the Highway 15. By the 1991 Gulf War, Ta'if was such a modern city in terms of communications that it was chosen as the site of the Rendon Group's television and radio network, which was used for communication with Kuwait during the Iraqi occupation.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe entirety of the Ta'if governorate is situated on a raised valley surrounded by the Hejaz mountains (part of the Sarawat mountains) to the west and south. The city is situated at an elevation of 1,879 m (6,165 ft) above mean sea level. For comparison, the surrounding mountains which separate Ta'if from nearby villages such as al-Hada and ash-Shafa, range in height anywhere from 2,000-3,500 m (6,560-11,485 ft). Ta'if is known to have had many wadis with running water before, suggested by the presence of dams along many of these.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTa'if has a hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification BWh), with hot summers and mild winters. Temperatures are not as extreme in summer as for lower-lying regions of Saudi Arabia. It is much cooler in Ta'if during the summertime than it is other parts of Saudi Arabia, particularly Riyadh. Precipitation is low, but all months see some rain, with more rain in spring and late autumn than in other months.\n\n\n== Economy & development ==\n\nHistorically, Ta'if's economy depended on agriculture and the cultivation of roses, which were traded throughout Central Asia and Transoxiana.Ta'if's modern economy is still mostly dependent on agriculture and perfumes, but an increasing diversification project has been taking place in order to combat the city's heavy dependence on these two industries. Due to the cultivation of grains such as wheat and the fruitorchards in the city, it has been called the \"garden of the Hejaz.\" The distilled rose oil from the Rosa \u00d7 damascena plant has been traditionally used as an 'ittar in the Middle East, usually as a masculine fragrance, and due to its cultivation in Ta'if, it has gained the name \"Ta'if rose.\"\n\nOn October 1, 2017, King Salman of Saudi Arabia inaugurated the \"New Ta'if\" project, a $3.9 billion project aiming at establishing a new, international airport in the city, dubbed the Ta'if International Airport, renovation and modernization of the historic Souk 'Okaz, establishment of the Oasis of Technology, which is expected to include an Antonov aircraft manufacturing and assembly plant, an industrial airport with a 3.5-km runway, a solar farm covering 25,000 square meters (269,100 sq ft) expected to produce 9.5 mW of electricity, the Residential Suburb, which is expected to include 10,000 residential units, the Industrial City, an 11 square kilometer (4.25 sq mi) industrial city with a complex for heavy, medium and light industries along with a vocational training center, and the University City, 16 square kilometer (6.2 sq mi) university projected to be built in the Saiysad National Park.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Natural landmarks ===\nAl Rudaf Park is a large natural park in South Ta'if, where trees stand amidst weathered granite rocks. The site also has a small zoo. Additionally, the park has a large lake with fountains and cannons. The Ta'if rose plantation is a complex of rose fields filled with small fragrant pink roses that are distilled into expensive Ta'if rose oil. The famous grown here is the 30-petal Damask rose (Rosa damascena trigintipetala), whose scent has been described as a robust, spicy, and dizzyingly complex scent which has been used by several luxury perfume brands, including Ormonde Jayne, Chanel, Guerlain and Herm\u00e8s. The Nuqbat al-Hamra' park near al-Hada is a large nature preserve at an elevation of 2,100 metres (6,900 feet) above sea level. ash-Shaf\u0101 is a small village situated high up in the mountains at an elevation of 2,200 to 2,500 metres (7,200 to 8,200 feet) above sea level, rich in agricultural products. The fruit gardens of Ta'if are located here. A camel ride is available, and Jabal Dakka is within view of the village. The Saiysad National Park is located in New Ta'if.\n\n\n=== Museums and historic landmarks ===\nLocated 40 km (25 mi) north of Ta'if is the site of the Souk 'Okaz, the largest and best known of the pre-Islamic souks. The souq was a scene of annual social, political and commercial gatherings. It was also the location of competitive recitation of poetry and prose. The buildings remain, including prominent outlines of walls of basaltic stone. Wadi Mitna is a wadi believed to be the location where Muhammad sought refuge from the tribes of Hawazin and Thaqif in 619 AD, after he was stoned by the tribes. He was later given sanctuary by his fellows in a small house, which has now been converted into a mosque. Shubra Palace is the regional museum of Ta'if, housed in a building built around 1900, which served as Ibn Saud's lodging in the 1930s, and was also used as the Presidency of the Council of Ministers of Saudi Arabia during King Faisal's reign. The Turkish Fort was a fort located near the Souk 'Okaz, many battles have been fought here and many prominent graves can be found, though only a small part of the original fort remains. Legend has it that Lawrence of Arabia also fought here. The Badawi Fortress is located in the southern reaches of East Ta'if.\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Souk 'Okaz, one of the best known pre-Islamic souks, was not only a market, but in many ways, a historic theater, where sociopolitical and commercial exchanges took place between the tribes of pre-Islamic Arabia. People from around the peninsula would come to visit the idol of the goddess Lat. This is proof that Ta'if has long been a historic center for trade and the arts in the Arabian Peninsula; contemporary theaters in the area include the 'Okaz Market Theater and the recently opened King 'Abdullah Park Theater. A performing arts theater is also located in the nearby town of Qia and is known as the Folk Theater of Qia.\nIn the framework of Saudi Seasons initiative, the first Ta'if Season took place on August 1, 2019. Artists from 7 countries participated in the event and a wide range of activities were overseen. Three main events have taken place during the season including the Souk 'Okaz festival and a camel race. As a sideline to the event, a rose festival in the city as well as a number of concerts and plays were held.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nLike most of Saudi Arabia, the most popular sport among Saudis in Ta'if is football. The Wej SC (Saudi Arabian Football Federation) plays at the King Fahd Sports City in North Ta'if near as-Sayl as-Saghir and is the football team representing the city. The expatriate minority in the city has brought several other games with them to Ta'if, including cricket, badminton and volleyball.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nDue to Ta'if's unique location in the mountains, most major highways bend around the city or either avoid the region completely. The only major highway in the Saudi Arabian network to pass through Ta'if is Highway 15 (known to locals as the Taif\u2013al-Hada Road) which arrives from Mecca in the west, bends around the mountains through al-Hada, passes through the center of Ta'if, and travels to Abha and Khamis Mushait via Baha and Baljurashi. Ta'if is connected to Highway 40 via Highway 267 and Highway 287. Highway 267 forms the western part of the Ta'if beltway, but then continues southward toward ash-Shafa, bypassing Mecca by using a longer route and gives access to Highway 304, Highway 301, Highway 40 and Highway 290 via Highway 298.\nTa'if is served by the Ta'if Regional Airport, and a new airport, dubbed the Ta'if International Airport, was scheduled to open in 2020, but this has been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The new airport is mainly designed to cater to 'Umrah and Hajj pilgrims and to relieve pressure off the King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah.\n\n\n== Famous people ==\n\n\n=== Tribes ===\n\nThe historically well known tribe of Thaqif still lives in and around the city of Ta'if. \u2018Utaibah is another Adnani tribe which still lives in Ta'if. Banu Harith is one of the Qahtani Arabs tribes living around Ta'if in Saudi Arabia. The tribe claims a very large area around the city in the area between Ta'if and Qunfudhah in Saudi Arabia. Thu al-Isba' al-'Adwani was an Arabic poet and a man of wisdom from the Banu 'Adwan tribe that historically lived in the northern parts of Ta'if. Furthermore, Banu Thabit are people descended from Thabit and the tribe is originally part of Hawazin clan.\n\n\n=== Births in the pre-modern era ===\nPre-Islamic leaders of Banu Thaqif\nDuring the pre-Islamic era, the city was populated by the tribe of Thaqif. The city had then the following chieftains:\n\n'Urwah ibn Mas'ud\n'Abd-ya-Layl ibn 'Amr\nUthman ibn Abu al-'AasOther important Islamic figures\n\n'Uthman bin 'Affan (579\u2013656) \u2014 3rd Rashidun Caliph and son-in-law of Muhammad\nal-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf (661\u2013714) \u2014 Umayyad-era Governor of Iraq and general\nMuhammad bin Qasim (695\u2013715) \u2014 Umayyad general who conquered the Sindh and Punjab regions along the Indus River.\n\n\n=== Births in the modern era ===\nMonarchs and royals\n\nKing Faisal I of Iraq (1885-1933) \u2014 20th-century King of Syria and Iraq\nPrince Nayef bin 'Abdulaziz Al Saud (1934\u20132012) \u2014 former Crown Prince and Minister of Interior of Saudi Arabia.Others\n\nHadi Soua'an Al-Somaily (1976\u2013present) \u2014 First Saudi Olympic medal winner.\nMutlaq Hamid Al-Otaibi (1937\u201395) \u2014 poet and writer; member of the Faculty of Sharia' at the Umm al-Qura' University\nHani Hanjour (1972\u20132001) \u2014 9/11 hijacker pilot who crashed American Airlines flight 77 into The Pentagon.\n\n\n=== Deaths ===\n'Abdullah ibn Abbas (619\u2013687) \u2014 cousin of Muhammad; buried in Jannat al-Baqi', Medina\nMidhat Pasha (1822\u201383) \u2014 Ottoman grand vizier; assassinated by strangulation in prison\nIbn Saud (1875\u20131953) \u2014 founder and 1st king of the Third Saudi State, the modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\nKhalid of Saudi Arabia (1913\u20131982) \u2014 4th king of Saudi Arabia and son of Ibn Saud\n\n\n== See also ==\nAl-Kateb House\nBanu Jadhimah\nTa'if Agreement\n'Utaybah\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Ta\u2019if at Wikimedia Commons\n Ta'if travel guide from Wikivoyage",

Diriyah was the original home of the Saudi royal family, and served as the capital of the Emirate of Diriyah under the first Saudi dynasty from 1744 to 1818. Today, the town is the seat of the Diriyah Governorate, which also includes the villages of Uyayna, Jubayla, and Al-Ammariyyah, among others, and is part of Ar Riyad Province.\nThe Turaif district, the first capital of Saudis, in Diriyah was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2010. For the 2018\u201319 Formula E Season, it was announced that Diriyah would host the season opening race.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe ruins of the old city of Diriyah lay on either side of the narrow valley known as Wadi Hanifa, which continues southwards through Riyadh and beyond. Consisting almost entirely of mud-brick structures, the ruins are divided into three districts, Ghussaibah, Al-Mulaybeed, and Turaif, set on top of hills overlooking the valley.  Of the three, Turaif is the highest, and its bottom is easily accessible to tourists by foot.  Part of the city wall, running along the edges of the wadi and also made of mud-bricks, are still extant along with some short observation towers.\nThe modern city is built at a lower altitude at the foot of the hill upon which Turaif is located. To the north of the town, inside the valley, are a number of gardens, palm groves, and small farms and estates. A dam known as Al-Ilb lies further north.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== During Muhammad's era ===\n\nDuring the Islamic Prophet Muhammad's era the Expedition of Muhammad ibn Maslamah took place here in July, 627AD in Muharram, 6AH.A platoon of thirty Muslims under the leadership of Muhammad bin Maslamah was despatched on a military mission. It headed for the habitation of the Qurata, a sept of the Bakr clan of the Banu Kilab. The Muslims attacked that sept and dispersed them in all directions. Plenty of spoils (war booty) were captured and the Muslims returned with the chief of the tribe of Banu Hanifa, called Thumamah Bin Uthal Al-Hanafi.The event is also mentioned by the Muslim scholar Ibn Sa'd in his book about Muhammad's military campaigns. he wrote about the expedition:\n\nSARIYYAH OF MUHAMMAD IBN MASLAMAH AGAINST AL-QURATA.\nThen occurred the sariyyah of Muhammad Ibn Maslamah against al-Qurata. He set out on 10 Muharram in the beginning of the fifty ninth month from the hijrah of the Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him. He (Prophet) despatched him against al-Qurata, an under-tribe of Banu Bakr a branch of the Kilab.\nThey used to halt at al-Bakarat, a place in the vicinity of Dariyyah. Dariyyah issituas- ed at (a distance of) seven stages from al-Madinah. He had ordered him to surround it from all sides. So he marched in the night and...[Ibn Sa'd, Kitab al-tabaqat al-kabir, p. 96]\n\n\n=== Post 1400 ===\nAlthough the location is sometimes identified with an ancient settlement mentioned by Yaqut and Al-Hamadani known as \"Ghabra\", the history of Diriyah proper dates back to the 15th century. According to the chroniclers of Nejd, the city was founded in 1446\u201347 by Mani' Al-Muraydi (\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u064a\u062f\u064a), an ancestor of the Saudi royal family. Mani and his clan had come from the area of Al-Qatif in eastern Arabia, upon the invitation of Ibn Dir' (\u0627\u0628\u0646 \u062f\u0631\u0639), who was then the ruler of a group of settlements that now make up Riyadh. Ibn Dir' is said to have been a relative of Mani' Al-Mraydi, and Mani's clan is believed to have left the area of Wadi Hanifa at some unknown date and were merely returning to their country of origin.Initially, Mani' and his clan, known as the Mrudah, settled in Ghusaybah (\u0627\u0644\u063a\u0635\u064a\u0628\u0629) and Al-Mulaybeed (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u064a\u0628\u064a\u062f). The entire settlement was named Al-Dir'iyah, after Mani's benefactor Ibn Dir'. Later on, the district of Turaif (\u0637\u064f\u0631\u064a\u0641) was settled.  Many families from other towns or from the bedouin tribes of the nearby desert eventually settled in the area and by the 18th century Diriyah had become a well-known town in Nejd.\nAt that time, Muhammad ibn Saud emerged from a struggle within the ruling family of Al-Diriyah, the Al Miqrin (\u0645\u0642\u0631\u0646, sons of Miqrin, a descendant of Mani'), and became the emir, or ruler, of Al-Diriyah. In 1744, Ibn Saud took in a religious scholar named Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, who hailed from the town of Al-Uyaynah, lying on the same wadi some 30 miles upstream. Ibn Saud agreed to implement Muhammadi religious views, and what later became known as the First Saudi State, with its capital at Diriyah, was born. Within the next several decades, Ibn Saud and his immediate descendants managed to subjugate all of Nejd, as well as the eastern and western regions of Arabia, and sent raids into Iraq. Diriyah quickly swelled in size and increased in wealth, becoming the largest town in Nejd and a major city in Arabia by the standards of the time. However, the Saudis' conquest of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina drew the ire of the Ottoman Empire, the major Islamic power at the time, led to the Ottoman-Saudi War of 1811\u20131818 and an invasion of Arabia by Ottoman and Egyptian forces brought the Saudi state to an end in 1818, with Diriyah capitulating after a nearly-year-long siege. The leader of the invading force, Ibrahim Pasha, ordered the destruction of Diriyah. However, when a member of the local nobility tried to revive the Wahhabi state in Diriyah, Ibrahim ordered his troops to destroy the town even further and set whatever was left of it on fire. When the Saudis revived their fortunes in 1824 and again in 1902, they made their capital further south in Riyadh, which has remained their capital ever since.\"The Ottoman Empire viewed the Arab challenge with alarm- especially after the loss of Makkah and Al-Madinah, and the deletion of the Ottoman emperor's name from Friday prayers- and an Egyptian army under Ibrahim Pasha was sent to recover lost territory. In 1818 the army entered Dar'iya and after a six month siege penetrated the defenses on the Turaif, totally destroyed the houses and cut down every tree in the palm groves. The Egyptians were estimated to have lost 10,000 men in the siege, and the Saudi forces 1,800.\"The town's original inhabitants left Diriyah after 1818, with the bulk of them moving to Riyadh. In The Kingdom (first published in 1981), British author Robert Lacey observed that the Al Saud had \"left the shell of their old capital behind them, an enduring reminder of the frontiers of the possible\" and compared the old Diriyah to \"a sand-blown Pompeii\". However, the area was resettled in the late 20th century, mostly by former nomads (bedouin), and a new city was founded by the Saudi government in the late 1970s.  This new city of Diriyah grew in size and is now a small but modern town and the seat of its own governorate. The ruins remain a tourist attraction, and are subject to a slow restoration project on the part of the Saudi government.\n\n\n== Renovations and development plans ==\n\nSaudi Arabia has formed the Diriyah Gate Development Authority (DGDA) to oversee preservation and development of the historic site.  In 2018, Jerry Inzerillo, previously the CEO of Forbes Travel Guide, to lead the new authority; Inzerillo has said that Diriyah will soon be known as \"the Beverly Hills of Riyadh.\"Among the rebuilt structures are the Bath and guest house, the Qasr Nasr, the Saad bin Saud Palace (finished by the early 90s), the Burj Faysal (a wall tower renovated in the 80s), major sections of the wall surrounding Turaif and sections of the outer walls and some watch towers surrounding the wadi. Outside of the Turaif district, on the opposite side of the wadi Hanifa, the region of the mosque of Sheik Mohammad bin Abdulwahab has been completely remodelled, leaving only some of the more recent original structures standing to the north of the complexe build on the site of the historic mosque.\nThe \"Turief District Development Plan\" aims to turn the district into a major national, cultural and touristic center. Before turning the complete site into a modern open-air museum documentation and necessary investigations, including excavations especially in places that may need to be remodelled, are planned in three major phases. These will include sites such as:\nAl-Imam Mohammad bin Saud Mosque and Salwa Palace.\nIbraheem Ibn Saud Palace and Fahad Ibn Saud Palace.\nFarhan Ibn Saud Palace, Torki Ibn Saud Palace and Qoo'a Al-Sharia'a (eastern court of Salwa Palace)Once finished, there will be a new visitors center as well as a documentation center. Four new museums are planned for the district.\nA museum of war and defense (as this was the site of a major siege in Saudi Arabia).\nA museum of horses.\nA museum of social life.\nA museum of commerce and finance.Additionally a Turief traditional market will add to the open-air museum experience.\nDespite Muhammadi destruction of many Islamic, non-Islamic, and historical sites associated with the first Muslims; the Prophet's family and companions) and the strong discouraging of visiting such sites (including mosques), the Saudi government renovated the domain of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab turning it into a major tourist attraction.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nThe old city's historic structures include:\nSalwa Palace, It was the residence and first home of the Al Saud Amirs and Imams during the First Saudi State. It is considered the largest palace on the site, rising four stories high.  It is composed of five main parts built at different consecutive periods of time. It was probably finished by Saud ibn Abdul Aziz ibn Muhammad ibn Saud, who was Imam from 1803 to 1814.\nSaad bin Saud Palace, One of the largest palaces on the site, it is famous for its courtyard, which was used as a stable. The palace is completely restored and several stories high.\nThe Guest House and At-Turaif Bath House  a traditional building  consisting of a number of small courtyards surrounded by rooms. The Bath House is famous for its different architectural styles and shows how the building was waterproofed by using different plasters. Both the Guest and Bath Houses were supplied with water from a well in the wadi.\nImam Mohammad bin Saud Mosque, a mosque  built during the reign of Imam Mohammad bin Saud. Sheik Mohammad bin Abdulwahab used to give lessons about his reformed movement of Islam in this mosque. It became a center for religious education. Students used to travel to it from all parts of the Arabian Peninsula.\nMosim Park, Football ground in the Nakheel area. It is home to football team Mosim FC, who are called The Pride of Dir'iyah. Mosim Park was erected in 2007 after Mosim FC moved there from their old ground downtown of Riyadh.\nAl-Bujairi, one of the districts of the city. It is known for its unique style of its buildings that are inspired by the surrounding palm trees.The layout of the city itself can be easily studied in the National Museum of Saudi Arabia with the help of a large scale detailed model of the city on display there.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nDiriyah has a hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification BWh).\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nDiriyah ePrix\nList of battles of Muhammad\nList of cities and towns in Saudi Arabia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhoto gallery (in Arabic)",

        "wiki": "Andalusia region (UK: , US: ; Spanish: Andaluc\u00eda [andalu\u02c8\u03b8i.a]) is the southern autonomous community in Peninsular Spain. It is the most populous, and the second largest autonomous community in the country. The Andalusian autonomous community is officially recognised as a \"historical nationality\". The territory is divided into eight provinces: Almer\u00eda, C\u00e1diz, C\u00f3rdoba, Granada, Huelva, Ja\u00e9n, M\u00e1laga and Seville. Its capital is the city of Seville. The seat of the High Court of Justice of Andalusia is located in the city of Granada.\nAndalusia is located in the south of the Iberian peninsula, in southwestern Europe, immediately south of the autonomous communities of Extremadura and Castilla-La Mancha; west of the autonomous community of Murcia and the Mediterranean Sea; east of Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean; and north of the Mediterranean Sea and the Strait of Gibraltar. Andalusia is the only European region with both Mediterranean and Atlantic coastlines. The small British overseas territory of Gibraltar shares a three-quarter-mile land border with the Andalusian portion of the province of C\u00e1diz at the eastern end of the Strait of Gibraltar.\nThe main mountain ranges of Andalusia are the Sierra Morena and the Baetic System, consisting of the Subbaetic and Penibaetic Mountains, separated by the Intrabaetic Basin. In the north, the Sierra Morena separates Andalusia from the plains of Extremadura and Castile\u2013La Mancha on Spain's Meseta Central. To the south the geographic subregion of Upper Andalusia lies mostly within the Baetic System, while Lower Andalusia is in the Baetic Depression of the valley of the Guadalquivir.The name \"Andalusia\" is derived from the Arabic word Al-Andalus (\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u062f\u0644\u0633). The toponym al-Andalus is first attested by inscriptions on coins minted in 716 by the new Muslim government of Iberia. These coins, called dinars, were inscribed in both Latin and Arabic. The etymology of the name \"al-Andalus\" has traditionally been derived from the name of the Vandals. Since the 1980s, a number of proposals have challenged this contention. Halm, in 1989, derived the name from a Gothic term, *landahlauts,\nand in 2002, Bossong suggested its derivation from a pre-Roman substrate. The region's history and culture have been influenced by the Tartessos, Iberians, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Vandals, Visigoths, Byzantines, Berbers of North Africa, Jews, Romani, Arab Umayyads, and Moors. During the Islamic Golden Age, Cordoba surpassed Constantinople to be Europe's biggest city, and became the capital of the Al Andalus and a prominent center of education and learning in the world, producing numerous philosophers and scientists. The Castilian and other Christian North Iberian nationalities reconquered and settled the area in the latter phases of the Reconquista.\nAndalusia has historically been an agricultural region, compared to the rest of Spain and the rest of Europe. Still, the growth of the community in the sectors of industry and services was above average in Spain and higher than many communities in the Eurozone. The region has a rich culture and a strong identity. Many cultural phenomena that are seen internationally as distinctively Spanish are largely or entirely Andalusian in origin. These include flamenco and, to a lesser extent, bullfighting and Hispano-Moorish architectural styles, both of which are also prevalent in some other regions of Spain.\nAndalusia's hinterland is the hottest area of Europe, with cities like C\u00f3rdoba and Seville averaging above 36 \u00b0C (97 \u00b0F) in summer high temperatures. Late evening temperatures can sometimes stay around 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) until close to midnight and daytime highs of over 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) are common. Seville also has the highest average annual temperature in mainland Spain and mainland Europe (19.2 \u00b0C), closely followed by Almer\u00eda (19.1 \u00b0C).\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nIts present form is derived from the Arabic name for Muslim Iberia, \"Al-Andalus\". The etymology of the name \"Al-Andalus\" is disputed, and the extent of Iberian territory encompassed by the name has changed over the centuries.The Spanish place name Andaluc\u00eda (immediate source of the English Andalusia) was introduced into the Spanish languages in the 13th century under the form el Andaluc\u00eda. The name was adopted to refer to those territories still under Moorish rule, and generally south of Castilla Nueva and Valencia, and corresponding with the former Roman province hitherto called Baetica in Latin sources. This was a Castilianization of Al-Andalusiya, the adjectival form of the Arabic language al-Andalus, the name given by the Arabs to all of the Iberian territories under Muslim rule from 711 to 1492. The etymology of al-Andalus is itself somewhat debated (see al-Andalus), but in fact it entered the Arabic language before this area came under Moorish rule.\nLike the Arabic term al-Andalus, in historical contexts the Spanish term Andaluc\u00eda or the English term Andalusia do not necessarily refer to the exact territory designated by these terms today. Initially, the term referred exclusively to territories under Muslim control. Later, it was applied to some of the last Iberian territories to be regained from the Muslims, though not always to exactly the same ones. In the Estoria de Espa\u00f1a (also known as the Primera Cr\u00f3nica General) of Alfonso X of Castile, written in the second half of the 13th century, the term Andaluc\u00eda is used with three different meanings:\n\nAs a literal translation of the Arabic al-\u00c1ndalus when Arabic texts are quoted.\nTo designate the territories the Christians had regained by that time in the Guadalquivir valley and in the Kingdoms of Granada and Murcia. In a document from 1253, Alfonso X styled himself Rey de Castilla, Le\u00f3n y de toda Andaluc\u00eda (\"King of Castile, Le\u00f3n and all of Andalusia\").\nTo designate the territories the Christians had regained by that time in the Guadalquivir valley until that date (the Kingdoms of Ja\u00e9n, C\u00f3rdoba and Seville \u2013 the Kingdom of Granada was incorporated in 1492). This was the most common significance in the Late Middle Ages and Early modern period.From an administrative point of view, Granada remained separate for many years even after the completion of the Reconquista due, above all, to its emblematic character as the last territory regained, and as the seat of the important Real Chanciller\u00eda de Granada, a court of last resort. Still, the reconquest and repopulation of Granada was accomplished largely by people from the three preexisting Christian kingdoms of Andalusia, and Granada came to be considered a fourth kingdom of Andalusia. The often-used expression \"Four Kingdoms of Andalusia\" dates back in Spanish at least to the mid-18th century.\n\n\n== Symbols ==\n\nThe Andalusian emblem shows the figure of Hercules and two lions between the two pillars of Hercules that tradition situates on either side of the Strait of Gibraltar. An inscription below, superimposed on an image of the flag of Andalusia reads Andaluc\u00eda por s\u00ed, para Espa\u00f1a y la Humanidad (\"Andalusia for herself, Spain and Humanity\"). Over the two columns is a semicircular arch in the colours of the flag of Andalusia, with the Latin words Dominator Hercules Fundator (Lord Hercules is the Founder) superimposed.The official flag of Andalusia consists of three equal horizontal stripes, coloured green, white, and green respectively; the Andalusian coat of arms is superimposed on the central stripe. Its design was overseen by Blas Infante and approved in the Assembly of Ronda (a 1918 gathering of Andalusian nationalists at Ronda). Blas Infante considered these to have been the colours most used in regional symbols throughout the region's history. According to him, the green came in particular from the standard of the Umayyad Caliphate and represented the call for a gathering of the populace. The white symbolised pardon in the Almohad dynasty, interpreted in European heraldry as parliament or peace. Other writers have justified the colours differently, with some Andalusian nationalists referring to them as the Arbonaida, meaning white-and-green in Mozarabic, a Romance language that was spoken in the region in Muslim times. Nowadays, the Andalusian government states that the colours of the flag evoke the Andalusian landscape as well as values of purity and hope for the future.\n\nThe anthem of Andalusia was composed by Jos\u00e9 del Castillo D\u00edaz (director of the Municipal Band of Seville, commonly known as Maestro Castillo) with lyrics by Blas Infante. The music was inspired by Santo Dios, a popular religious song sung at harvest time by peasants and day labourers in the provinces of M\u00e1laga, Seville, and Huelva. Blas Infante brought the song to Maestro Castillo's attention; Maestro Castillo adapted and harmonized the traditional melody. The lyrics appeal to the Andalusians to mobilise and demand tierra y libertad (\"land and liberty\") by way of agrarian reform and a statute of autonomy within Spain.\nThe Parliament of Andalusia voted unanimously in 1983 that the preamble to the Statute of Autonomy recognise Blas Infante as the Father of the Andalusian Nation (Padre de la Patria Andaluza), which was reaffirmed in the reformed Statute of Autonomy submitted to popular referendum 18 February 2007. The preamble of the present 2007 Statute of Autonomy says that Article 2 of the present Spanish Constitution of 1978 recognises Andalusia as a nationality. Later, in its articulation, it speaks of Andalusia as a \"historic nationality\" (Spanish: nacionalidad hist\u00f3rica). It also cites the 1919 Andalusianist Manifesto of C\u00f3rdoba describing Andalusia as a \"national reality\" (realidad nacional), but does not endorse that formulation. Article 1 of the earlier 1981 Statute of Autonomy defined it simply as a \"nationality\" (nacionalidad).The national holiday, the D\u00eda de Andaluc\u00eda, is celebrated on 28 February, commemorating the 1980 autonomy referendum. In spite of this, nationalist groups celebrate the holiday on 4 December, commemorating the 1977 demonstrations to demand autonomy.The honorific title of Hijo Predilecto de Andaluc\u00eda (\"Favourite Son of Andalucia\") is granted by the Autonomous Government of Andalusia to those whose exceptional merits benefited Andalusia, for work or achievements in natural, social, or political science. It is the highest distinction given by the Autonomous Community of Andalusia.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Sevillian historian Antonio Dom\u00ednguez Ortiz wrote that:\n\none must seek the essence of Andalusia in its geographic reality on the one hand, and on the other in the awareness of its inhabitants. From the geographic point of view, the whole of the southern lands is too vast and varied to be embraced as a single unit. In reality there are not two, but three Andalusias: the Sierra Morena, the Valley [of the Guadalquivir] and the [Cordillera] Penib\u00e9tica\n\n\n=== Location ===\nAndalusia has a surface area of 87,597 square kilometres (33,821 sq mi), 17.3 percent of the territory of Spain. Andalusia alone is comparable in extent and in the variety of its terrain to any of several of the smaller European countries. To the east is the Mediterranean Sea; to the west the Atlantic Ocean; to the north the Sierra Morena constitutes the border with the Meseta Central; to the south, the self-governing British overseas territory of Gibraltar and the Strait of Gibraltar separate it from Morocco.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nAndalusia is home to the hottest and driest summers in Spain, but in the west, weather systems sweeping in from the Atlantic ensure that it is relatively wet in the winter, with some areas receiving copious amounts. Contrary to what many people think, as a whole, the region enjoys above-average yearly rainfall in the context of Spain.Andalusia sits at a latitude between 36\u00b0 and 38\u00b0 44' N, in the warm-temperate region. In general, it experiences a hot-summer Mediterranean climate, with dry summers influenced by the Azores High, but subject to occasional torrential rains and extremely hot temperatures. In the winter, the tropical anticyclones move south, allowing cold polar fronts to penetrate the region. Still, within Andalusia there is considerable climatic variety. From the extensive coastal plains one may pass to the valley of the Guadalquivir, barely above sea level, then to the highest altitudes in the Iberian peninsula in the peaks of the Sierra Nevada. In a mere 50 km (31 mi) one can pass from the subtropical coast of the province of Granada to the snowy peaks of Mulhac\u00e9n. Andalusia also includes both the dry Tabernas Desert in the province of Almer\u00eda and the Sierra de Grazalema Natural Park in the province of C\u00e1diz, which experiences Spain's greatest rainfall.Annual rainfall in the Sierra de Grazalema has been measured as high as 4,346 millimetres (171.1 in) in 1963, the highest ever recorded for any location in Iberia. Andalusia is also home to the driest place in continental Europe, the Cabo de Gata, with only 117 millimetres (4.6 in) of rain per year.\nIn general, as one goes from west to east, away from the Atlantic, there is less precipitation. \"Wet Andalusia\" includes most of the highest points in the region, above all the Sierra de Grazalema but also the Serran\u00eda de Ronda in western M\u00e1laga. The valley of the Guadalquivir has moderate rainfall. The Tabernas Desert in Almer\u00eda, Europe's only true desert, has less than 75 days with any measurable precipitation, and some particular places in the desert have as few as 50 such days. Much of \"dry Andalusia\" has more than 300 \"sunny\" days a year.\nThe average temperature in Andalusia throughout the year is over 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F). Averages in the cities range from 15.1 \u00b0C (59.2 \u00b0F) in Baeza to 19.1 \u00b0C (66.4 \u00b0F) in Almer\u00eda. Much of the Guadalquivir valley and the Mediterranean coast has an average of about 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F). The coldest month is January when Granada at the foot of the Sierra Nevada experiences an average temperature of 6.4 \u00b0C (43.5 \u00b0F). The hottest are July and August, with an average temperature of 28.5 \u00b0C (83.3 \u00b0F) for Andalusia as a whole. C\u00f3rdoba is the hottest provincial capital, followed by Seville.The Guadalquivir valley has experienced some of the highest temperatures recorded in Europe, with a maximum of 46.6 \u00b0C (115.9 \u00b0F) recorded at C\u00f3rdoba and Seville. The mountains of Granada and Ja\u00e9n have the coldest temperatures in southern Iberia, but do not reach continental extremes (and, indeed are surpassed by some mountains in northern Spain). In the cold snap of January 2005, Santiago de la Espada (Ja\u00e9n) experienced a temperature of \u221221 \u00b0C (\u22126 \u00b0F) and the ski resort at Sierra Nevada National Park\u2014the southernmost ski resort in Europe\u2014dropped to \u221218 \u00b0C (0 \u00b0F). Sierra Nevada Natural Park has Iberia's lowest average annual temperature, (3.9 \u00b0C or 39.0 \u00b0F at Pradollano) and its peaks remain snowy practically year-round.\n\n\n=== Terrain ===\n\nMountain ranges affect climate, the network of rivers, soils and their erosion, bioregions, and even human economies insofar as they rely on natural resources. The Andalusian terrain offers a range of altitudes and slopes. Andalusia has the Iberian peninsula's highest mountains and nearly 15 percent of its terrain over 1,000 metres (3,300 ft). The picture is similar for areas under 100 metres (330 ft) (with the Baetic Depression), and for the variety of slopes.\nThe Atlantic coast is overwhelmingly beach and gradually sloping coasts; the Mediterranean coast has many cliffs, above all in the Malagan Axarqu\u00eda and in Granada and Almer\u00eda. This asymmetry divides the region naturally into Upper Andalusia (two mountainous areas) and Lower Andalusia (the broad basin of the Guadalquivir).The Sierra Morena separates Andalusia from the plains of Extremadura and Castile\u2013La Mancha on Spain's Meseta Central. Although sparsely populated, this is not a particularly high range, and its highest point, the 1,323-metre (4,341 ft) peak of La Ba\u00f1uela in the Sierra Madrona, lies outside of Andalusia. Within the Sierra Morena, the gorge of Despe\u00f1aperros forms a natural frontier between Castile and Andalusia.\nThe Baetic Cordillera consists of the parallel mountain ranges of the Cordillera Penib\u00e9tica near the Mediterranean coast and the Cordillera Subb\u00e9tica inland, separated by the Surco Intrab\u00e9tico. The Cordillera Subb\u00e9tica is quite discontinuous, offering many passes that facilitate transportation, but the Penib\u00e9tico forms a strong barrier between the Mediterranean coast and the interior. The Sierra Nevada, part of the Cordillera Penib\u00e9tica in the Province of Granada, has the highest peaks in Iberia: El Mulhac\u00e9n at 3,478 metres (11,411 ft) and El Veleta at 3,392 metres (11,129 ft).\nLower Andalusia, the Baetic Depression, the basin of the Guadalquivir, lies between these two mountainous areas. It is a nearly flat territory, open to the Gulf of C\u00e1diz in the southeast. Throughout history, this has been the most populous part of Andalusia.\n\n\n=== Hydrography ===\n\nAndalusia has rivers that flow into both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Flowing to the Atlantic are the Guadiana, Odiel-Tinto, Guadalquivir, Guadalete, and Barbate. Flowing to the Mediterranean are the Guadiaro, Guadalhorce, Guadalmedina, Guadalfeo, Andarax (also known as the Almer\u00eda) and Almanzora. Of these, the Guadalquivir is the longest in Andalusia and fifth longest on the Iberian peninsula, at 657 kilometres (408 mi).\n\nThe rivers of the Atlantic basin are characteristically long, run through mostly flat terrain, and have broad river valleys. As a result, at their mouths are estuaries and wetlands, such as the marshes of Do\u00f1ana in the delta of the Guadalquivir, and wetlands of the Odiel. In contrast, the rivers of the Mediterranean Basin are shorter, more seasonal, and make a precipitous descent from the mountains of the Baetic Cordillera. Their estuaries are small, and their valleys are less suitable for agriculture. Also, being in the rain shadow of the Baetic Cordillera means that they receive a lesser volume of water.The following hydrographic basins can be distinguished in Andalusia. On the Atlantic side are the Guadalquivir basin; the Andalusian Atlantic Basin with the sub-basins Guadalete-Barbate and Tinto-Odiel; and the Guadiana basin. On the Mediterranean side is the Andalusian Mediterranean Basin and the upper portion of the basin of the Segura.\n\n\n=== Soils ===\nThe soils of Andalusia can be divided into three large areas: the Sierra Morena, Cordillera Subb\u00e9tica, and the Baetic Depression and the Surco Intrab\u00e9tico.The Sierra Morena, due to its morphology and the acidic content of its rocks, developed principally relatively poor, shallow soils, suitable only for forests. In the valleys and in some areas where limestone is present, deeper soils allowed farming of cereals suitable for livestock. The more complicated morphology of the Baetic Cordillera makes it more heterogeneous, with the most heterogeneous soils in Andalusia. Very roughly, in contrast to the Sierra Morena, a predominance of basic (alkaline) materials in the Cordillera Subb\u00e9tica, combined with a hilly landscape, generates deeper soils with greater agricultural capacity, suitable to the cultivation of olives.Finally, the Baetic Depression and the Surco Intrab\u00e9tico have deep, rich soils, with great agricultural capacity. In particular, the alluvial soils of the Guadalquivir valley and plain of Granada have a loamy texture and are particularly suitable for intensive irrigated crops. In the hilly areas of the countryside, there is a double dynamic: the depressions have filled with older lime-rich material, developing the deep, rich, dark clay soils the Spanish call bujeo, or tierras negras andaluzas, excellent for dryland farming. In other zones, the whiter albariza provides an excellent soil for vineyards.Despite their marginal quality, the poorly consolidated soils of the sandy coastline of Huelva and Almer\u00eda\nhave been successfully used in recent decades for hothouse cultivation under clear plastic of strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and other fruits.\n\n\n=== Flora ===\n\nBiogeographically, Andalusia forms part of the Western Mediterranean subregion of the Mediterranean Basin, which falls within the Boreal Kingdom. Five floristic provinces lie, in whole or in part, within Andalusia: along much of the Atlantic coast, the Lusitanian-Andalusian littoral or Andalusian Atlantic littoral; in the north, the southern portion of the Luso-Extremaduran floristic province; covering roughly half of the region, the Baetic floristic province; and in the extreme east, the Almerian portion of the Almerian-Murcian floristic province and (coinciding roughly with the upper Segura basin) a small portion of the Castilian-Maestrazgan-Manchegan floristic province. These names derive primarily from past or present political geography: \"Luso\" and \"Lusitanian\" from Lusitania, one of three Roman provinces in Iberia, most of the others from present-day Spanish provinces, and Maestrazgo being a historical region of northern Valencia.\n\nIn broad terms, the typical vegetation of Andalusia is Mediterranean woodland, characterized by leafy xerophilic perennials, adapted to the long, dry summers. The dominant species of the climax community is the holly oak (Quercus ilex). Also abundant are cork oak (Quercus suber), various pines, and Spanish fir (Abies pinsapo). Due to cultivation, olive (Olea europaea) and almond (Prunus dulcis) trees also abound. The dominant understory is composed of thorny and aromatic woody species, such as rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), thyme (Thymus), and Cistus. In the wettest areas with acidic soils, the most abundant species are the oak and cork oak, and the cultivated Eucalyptus. In the woodlands, leafy hardwoods of genus Populus (poplars, aspens, cottonwoods) and Ulmus (elms) are also abundant; poplars are cultivated in the plains of Granada.The Andalusian woodlands have been much altered by human settlement, the use of nearly all of the best land for farming, and frequent wildfires. The degraded forests become shrubby and combustible garrigue. Extensive areas have been planted with non-climax trees such as pines. There is now a clear conservation policy for the remaining forests, which survive almost exclusively in the mountains.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\n\nThe biodiversity of Andalusia extends to its fauna as well. More than 400 of the 630 vertebrate species extant in Spain can be found in Andalusia. Spanning the Mediterranean and Atlantic basins, and adjacent to the Strait of Gibraltar, Andalusia is on the migratory route of many of the numerous flocks of birds that travel annually from Europe to Africa and back.The Andalusian wetlands host a rich variety of birds. Some are of African origin, such as the red-knobbed coot (Fulica cristata), the purple swamphen (Porphyrio porphyrio), and the greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus roseus). Others originate in Northern Europe, such as the greylag goose (Anser anser). Birds of prey (raptors) include the Spanish imperial eagle (Aquila adalberti), the griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus), and both the black and red kite (Milvus migrans and Milvus milvus).\n\nAmong the herbivores, are several deer (Cervidae) species, notably the fallow deer (Dama dama) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus); the European mouflon (Ovis orientalis musimon), a type of sheep; and the Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica, which despite its scientific name is no longer found in the Pyrenees). The Spanish ibex has recently been losing ground to the Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia), an invasive species from Africa, introduced for hunting in the 1970s. Among the small herbivores are rabbits\u2014especially the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus)\u2014which form the most important part of the diet of the carnivorous species of the Mediterranean woodlands.\nThe large carnivores such as the Iberian wolf (Canis lupus signatus) and the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) are quite threatened, and are limited to the Sierra de And\u00fajar, inside of Sierra Morena, Do\u00f1ana and Despe\u00f1aperros. Stocks of the wild boar (Sus scrofa), on the other hand, have been well preserved because they are popular with hunters. More abundant and in varied situations of conservation are such smaller carnivores as otters, dogs, foxes, the European badger (Meles meles), the European polecat (Mustela putorius), the least weasel (Mustela nivalis), the wildcat (Felis silvestris), the common genet (Genetta genetta), and the Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon).Other notable species are Acherontia atropos (a variety of death's-head hawkmoth), Vipera latasti (a venomous snake), and the endemic (and endangered) fish Aphanius baeticus.\n\n\n=== Protected areas ===\n\nAndalusia has many unique ecosystems. In order to preserve these areas in a manner compatible with both conservation and economic exploitation, many of the most representative ecosystems have been given protected status.The various levels of protection are encompassed within the Network of Protected Natural Spaces of Andalusia (Red de Espacios Naturales Protegidos de Andaluc\u00eda, RENPA) which integrates all protected natural spaces located in Andalusia, whether they are protected at the level of the local community, the autonomous community of Andalusia, the Spanish state, or by international conventions. RENPA consists of 150 protected spaces, consisting of two national parks, 24 natural parks, 21 periurban parks (on the fringes of cities or towns), 32 natural sites, two protected countrysides, 37 natural monuments, 28 nature reserves, and four concerted nature reserves (in which a government agency coordinates with the owner of the property for its management), all part of the European Union's Natura 2000 network. Under the international ambit are the nine Biosphere Reserves, 20 Ramsar wetland sites, four Specially Protected Areas of Mediterranean Importance and two UNESCO Geoparks.In total, nearly 20 percent of the territory of Andalusia lies in one of these protected areas, which constitute roughly 30 percent of the protected territory of Spain. Among these many spaces, some of the most notable are the Sierras de Cazorla, Segura y Las Villas Natural Park, Spain's largest natural park and the second largest in Europe, the Sierra Nevada National Park, Do\u00f1ana National Park and Natural Park, the Tabernas Desert, and the Cabo de Gata-N\u00edjar Natural Park, the largest terrestrial-maritime reserve in the European Western Mediterranean Sea.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe geostrategic position of Andalusia in the extreme south of Europe, providing (along with Morocco) a gateway between Europe and Africa, added to its position between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, as well as its rich deposits of minerals and its agricultural wealth, have made Andalusia a tempting prize for civilizations since prehistoric times. Add to this its area of 87,268 square kilometres (33,694 sq mi) (larger than many European countries), and it can be no surprise that Andalusia has figured prominently in the history of Europe and the Mediterranean.\nSeveral theories postulate that the first hominids in Europe were in Andalusia, having passed across the Strait of Gibraltar; the earliest known paintings of humanity have been found in the Caves of Nerja, M\u00e1laga. The first settlers, based on artifacts from the archaeological sites at Los Millares, El Argar, and Tartessos, were clearly influenced by cultures of the Eastern Mediterranean who arrived on the Andalusian coast. Andalusia then went through a period of protohistory, when the region did not have a written language of its own, but its existence was known to and documented by literate cultures, principally the Phoenicians and Ancient Greeks, wide historical moment in which C\u00e1diz was founded, regarded by many as the oldest city still standing in Western Europe; another city among the oldest is M\u00e1laga. During the second millennium BCE, the kingdom of Tartessos developed in Andalusia.\n\n\n=== Carthaginians and Romans ===\n\nWith the fall of the original Phoenician cities in the East, Carthage \u2013 itself the most significant Phoenician colony \u2013 became the dominant sea power of the western Mediterranean and the most important trading partner for the Phoenician towns along the Andalusian coast. Between the First and Second Punic Wars, Carthage extended its control beyond Andalucia to include all of Iberia except the Basque Country. Andalusia was the major staging ground for the war with Rome led by the Carthaginian general Hannibal. The Romans defeated the Carthaginians and conquered Andalusia, the region being renamed Baetica. It was fully incorporated into the Roman Empire, and from this region came many Roman magistrates and senators, as well as the emperors Trajan and (most likely) Hadrian.\n\n\n=== Vandals, Visigoths and the Byzantine Empire ===\nThe Vandals moved briefly through the region during the 5th century AD before settling in North Africa, after which the region fell into the hands of the Visigothic Kingdom. The Visigoths in this region were practically independent of the Visigothic Catholic Kingdom of Toledo. This is the era of Saints Isidore of Seville and Hermenegild. During this period, around 555 AD, the Eastern Roman Empire conquered Andalusia under Justinian I, the Eastern Roman Emperor. They established Spania, a province of the Byzantine Empire from 552 until 624. Though their holdings were quickly reduced, they continued to have interests in the region until it was lost altogether in 624.\n\n\n=== Al-Andalus states ===\n\nThe Visigothic era came to an abrupt end in 711 with the Umayyad conquest of Hispania by the Muslim Umayyad general Tariq ibn Ziyad. Tariq is known in Umayyad history and legend as a formidable conqueror who dared and bore the nerve to burn his fleet of ships, when he landed with his troops on the coast of Gibraltar \u2013 an acronym of \"Jabel alTariq\" meaning \"the mountain of Tariq\". When the Muslim invaders seized control and consolidated their dominion of the region, they remained tolerant of the local faiths, but they also needed a place for their own faith. In the 750s, they forcibly rented half of Cordoba's Cathedral of San Vicente (Visigothic) to use as a mosque.\n The mosque's hypostyle plan, consisting of a rectangular prayer hall and an enclosed courtyard, followed a tradition established in the Umayyad and Abbasid mosques of Syria and Iraq while the dramatic articulation of the interior of the prayer hall was unprecedented.  The system of columns supporting double arcades of piers and arches with alternating red and white voussoirs is an unusual treatment that, structurally, combined striking visual effect with the practical advantage of providing greater height within the hall.  Alternating red and white voussoirs are associated with Umayyad monuments such as the Great Mosque of Damascus and the Dome of the Rock. Their use in the Great Mosque of Cordoba manages to create a stunningly original visual composition even as it emphasises 'Abd al-Rahman's connection to the established Umayyad tradition.In this period, the name \"Al-Andalus\" was applied to the Iberian Peninsula, and later it referred to the parts not controlled by the Gothic states in the North. The Muslim rulers in Al-Andalus were economic invaders and interested in collecting taxes; social changes imposed on the native populace were mainly confined to geographical, political and legal conveniences. Al-Andalus remained connected to other states under Muslim rule; also trade routes between it and Constantinople and Alexandria remained open, while many cultural features of the Roman Empire were transmitted throughout Europe and the Near East by its successor state, the Byzantine Empire. Byzantine architecture is an example of such cultural diffusion continuing even after the collapse of the empire.Nevertheless, the Guadalquivir River valley became the point of power projection in the peninsula with the Caliphate of Cordoba making Cordoba its capital. The Umayyad Caliphate produced such leaders as Caliph Abd-ar-Rahman III (ruled 912\u2013961) and his son, Caliph Al-Hakam II (ruled 961\u2013976) and built the magnificent Great Mosque of Cordoba. Under these rulers, Cordoba was the center of economic and cultural significance.By the 10th century, the northern Kingdoms of Spain and other European Crowns had begun what would eventually become the Reconquista: the reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula for Christendom. Caliph Abd-ar-Rahman suffered some minor military defeats, but often managed to manipulate the Gothic northern kingdoms to act against each other's interests. Al-Hakam achieved military successes, but at the expense of uniting the north against him.\n\nAfter the conquest of Toledo in 1086 by Alfonso VI, the Crown of Castille and the Crown of Aragon dominated large parts of the peninsula. The main Taifas therefore had to resort to assistance from various other powers across the Mediterranean. A number of different Muslim dynasties of North African origin\u2014notably Almoravid dynasty and Almohad dynasty\u2014dominated a slowly diminishing Al-Andalus over the next several centuries.After the victory at the Battle of Sagrajas (1086) put a temporary stop to Castile expansion, the Almoravid dynasty reunified Al-Andalus with its capital in Granada, ruling until the mid-12th century. The various Taifa kingdoms were assimilated. the Almohad dynasty expansion in North Africa weakened Al-Andalus, and in 1170 the Almohads transferred their capital from Marrakesh to Seville. The victory at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa (1212) marked the beginning of the end of the Almohad dynasty.\n\n\n=== Crown of Castile ===\nThe weakness caused by the collapse of Almohad power and the subsequent creation of new Taifas, each with its own ruler, led to the rapid Castile reconquest of the valley of the Guadalquivir. C\u00f3rdoba was regained in 1236 and Seville in 1248. The fall of Granada on 2 January 1492 put an end to the Nasrid rule, event that marks the beginning of Andalusia, the southern four territories of the Crown of Castile in the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nSeven months later, on 3 August 1492 Christopher Columbus left the town of Palos de la Frontera, Huelva, with the first expedition that resulted in the Discovery of the Americas, that would end the Middle Ages and signal the beginning of modernity. Many Castilians participated in this and other expeditions that followed, some of them known as the Minor or Andalusian Journeys.\nContacts between Spain and the Americas, including royal administration and the shipping trade from Asia and America for over three hundred years, came almost exclusively through the south of Spain, specially Seville and Cadiz ports.As a result, it became the wealthiest, most influential region in Spain and amongst the most influential in Europe. For example, the Habsburg diverted much of this trade wealth to control its European territories.\n\n\n=== Hapsburg Spain ===\nIn the first half of the 16th century plague was still prevalent in Spain. According to George C. Kohn, \"One of the worst epidemics of the century, whose miseries were accompanied by severe drought and food shortage, started in 1505; by 1507, about 100,000 people had died in Andalusia alone. Andalusia was struck once again in 1646. For three years, plague haunted the entire region, causing perhaps as many as 200,000 deaths, especially in M\u00e1laga and Seville.\"\n\nFollowing the Second Rebellion of the Alpujarras in 1568\u20131571, the Moorish population\u2014that is, unconverted Moriscos\u2014were expelled from Kingdom of Castile (and Aragon). Yet, by order of the Spanish crown, two Moorish families were required to remain in each village in order to demonstrate to the new inhabitants, introduced from northern Spain, the workings of the terracing and irrigation systems on which the district's agriculture depends.In 1810\u201312 Spanish troops strongly resisted the French occupation during the Peninsular War (part of the Napoleonic Wars).Andalusia profited from the Spanish overseas empire, although much trade and finance eventually came to be controlled by other parts of Europe to where it was ultimately destined. In the 18th century, commerce from other parts of Spain began to displace Andalusian commerce when the Spanish government ended Andalusia's trading monopoly with the colonies in the Americas. The loss of the empire in the 1820s hurt the economy of the region, particularly the cities that had benefited from the trade and ship building. The construction of railways in the latter part of the 19th century enabled Andalusia to better develop its agricultural potential and it became an exporter of food. While industrialisation was taking off in the northern Spanish regions of Catalonia and the Basque country, Andalusia remained traditional and displayed a deep social division between a small class of wealthy landowners and a population made up largely of poor agricultural labourers and tradesmen.\n\n\n=== Francoist oppressions ===\n\nAndalusia was one of the worst affected regions of Spain by Francisco Franco's brutal campaign of mass-murder and political suppression called the White Terror during and after the Spanish Civil War. The Nationalist rebels bombed and seized the working-class districts of the main Andalusian cities in the first days of the war, and afterwards went on to execute thousands of workers and militants of the leftist parties: in the city of Cordoba 4,000; in the city of Granada 5,000; in the city of Seville 3,028; and in the city of Huelva 2,000 killed and 2,500 disappeared. The city of M\u00e1laga, occupied by the Nationalists in February 1937 following the Battle of M\u00e1laga, experienced one of the harshest repressions following Francoist victory with an estimated total of 17,000 people summarily executed. Carlos Arias Navarro, then a young lawyer who as public prosecutor signed thousands of execution warrants in the trials set up by the triumphant rightists, became known as \"The Butcher of M\u00e1laga\" (Carnicero de M\u00e1laga).Paul Preston estimates the total number of victims of deliberately killed by the Nationalists in Andalusia at 55,000.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nAndalusia is one of the 17 autonomous communities of Spain. The Regional Government of Andalusia (Spanish: Junta de Andaluc\u00eda) includes the Parliament of Andalusia, its chosen president, a Consultative Council, and other bodies.\nThe Autonomous Community of Andalusia was formed in accord with a referendum of 28 February 1980 and became an autonomous community under the 1981 Statute of Autonomy known as the Estatuto de Carmona. The process followed the Spanish Constitution of 1978, still current as of 2009, which recognizes and guarantees the right of autonomy for the various regions and nationalities of Spain. The process to establish Andalusia as an autonomous region followed Article 151 of the Constitution, making Andalusia the only autonomous community to take that particular course. That article was set out for regions like Andalusia that had been prevented by the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War from adopting a statute of autonomy during the period of the Second Spanish Republic.\nArticle 1 of the 1981 Statute of Autonomy justifies autonomy based on the region's \"historical identity, on the self-government that the Constitution permits every nationality, on outright equality to the rest of the nationalities and regions that compose Spain, and with a power that emanates from the Andalusian Constitution and people, reflected in its Statute of Autonomy\".In October 2006 the constitutional commission of the Cortes Generales (the national legislature of Spain), with favorable votes from the left-of-center Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), the leftist United Left (IU) and the right-of-center People's Party (PP), approved a new Statute of Autonomy for Andalusia, whose preamble refers to the community as a \"national reality\" (realidad nacional):\n\nThe Andalusianist Manifesto of C\u00f3rdoba described Andalusia as a national reality in 1919, whose spirit the Andalusians took up outright through the process of self-government recognized in our Magna Carta. In 1978 the Andalusians broadly backed the constitutional consensus. Today, the Constitution, in its Article 2, recognizes Andalusia as a nationality as part of the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation.\nOn 2 November 2006 the Spanish Chamber Deputies ratified the text of the Constitutional Commission with 306 votes in favor, none opposed, and 2 abstentions. This was the first time a Spanish Organic Law adopting a Statute of Autonomy was approved with no opposing votes. The Senate, in a plenary session of 20 December 2006, ratified the referendum to be voted upon by the Andalusian public 18 February 2007.\nThe Statute of Autonomy spells out Andalusia's distinct institutions of government and administration. Chief among these is the Andalusian Autonomous Government (Junta de Andaluc\u00eda). Other institutions specified in the Statute are the Defensor del Pueblo Andaluz (literally \"Defender of the Andalusian People\", basically an ombudsperson), the Consultative Council, the Chamber of Accounts, the Audiovisual Council of Andalusia, and the Economic and Social Council.\nThe Andalusian Statute of Autonomy recognizes Seville as the region's capital. The Andalusian Autonomous Government is located there. The region's highest court, the High Court of Andalusia (Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Andaluc\u00eda) is not part of the Autonomous Government, and has its seat in Granada.\n\n\n=== Autonomous Government ===\n\nThe Andalusian Autonomous Government (Junta de Andaluc\u00eda) is the institution of self-government of the Autonomous Community of Andalusia. Within the government, the President of the Regional Government of Andalusia is the supreme representative of the autonomous community, and the ordinary representative of the Spanish state in the autonomous community. The president is formally named to the position by the Monarch of Spain and then confirmed by a majority vote of the Parliament of Andalusia. In practice, the monarch always names a person acceptable to the ruling party or coalition of parties in the autonomous region. In theory, were the candidate to fail to gain the needed majority, the monarch could propose a succession of candidates. After two months, if no proposed candidate could gain the parliament's approval, the parliament would automatically be dissolved and the acting president would call new elections. On 5 September 2013 Susana D\u00edaz was elected president.\nThe Council of Government, the highest political and administrative organ of the Community, exercises regulatory and executive power. The President presides over the council, which also includes the heads of various departments (Consejer\u00edas). In the current legislature (2008\u20132012), there are 15 of these departments. In order of precedence, they are Presidency, Governance, Economy and Treasury, Education, Justice and Public Administration, Innovation, Science and Business, Public Works and Transportation, Employment, Health, Agriculture and Fishing, Housing and Territorial Planning, Tourism, Commerce and Sports, Equality and Social Welfare, Culture, and Environment.\nThe Parliament of Andalusia, its Autonomic Legislative Assembly, develops and approves laws and elects and removes the President. Elections to the Andalusian Parliament follow a democratic formula through which the citizens elect 109 representatives. After the approval of the Statute of Autonomy through Organic Law 6/1981 on 20 December 1981, the first elections to the autonomic parliament took place 23 May 1982. Further elections have occurred in 1986, 1990, 1994, 1996, 2000, 2004, and 2008.\nThe current (2008\u20132012) legislature includes representatives of the PSOE-A (Andalusian branch of the left-of-center PSOE), PP-A (Andalusian branch of the right-of-center PP) and IULV-CA (Andalusian branch of the leftist IU).\n\n\n=== Judicial power ===\nThe High Court of Andalusia (Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Andaluc\u00eda) in Granada is subject only to the higher jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Spain. The High Court is not an organ of the Autonomous Community, but rather of the Judiciary of Spain, which is unitary throughout the kingdom and whose powers are not transferred to the autonomous communities. The Andalusian territory is divided into 88 legal/judicial districts (partidos judiciales).\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\n\n=== Provinces ===\n\nAndalusia consists of eight provinces. The latter were established by Javier de Burgos in the 1833 territorial division of Spain. Each of the Andalusian provinces bears the same name as its capital:\nAndalusia is traditionally divided into two historical subregions: Upper Andalusia or Eastern Andalusia (Andaluc\u00eda Oriental), consisting of the provinces of Almer\u00eda, Granada, Ja\u00e9n, and M\u00e1laga, and Lower Andalusia or Western Andalusia (Andaluc\u00eda Occidental), consisting of the provinces of C\u00e1diz, C\u00f3rdoba, Huelva and Seville.\n\n\n=== Comarcas and mancomunidades ===\n\nWithin the various autonomous communities of Spain, comarcas are comparable to shires (or, in some countries, counties) in the English-speaking world. Unlike in some of Spain's other autonomous communities, under the original 1981 Statute of Autonomy, the comarcas of Andalusia had no formal recognition, but, in practice, they still had informal recognition as geographic, cultural, historical, or in some cases administrative entities. The 2007 Statute of Autonomy echoes this practice, and mentions comarcas in Article 97 of Title III, which defines the significance of comarcas and establishes a basis for formal recognition in future legislation.The current statutory entity that most closely resembles a comarca is the mancomunidad, a freely chosen, bottom-up association of municipalities intended as an instrument of socioeconomic development and coordination between municipal governments in specific areas.\n\n\n=== Municipalities and local entities ===\n\nBeyond the level of provinces, Andalusia is further divided into 774 municipalities (municipios). The municipalities of Andalusia are regulated by Title III of the Statute of Autonomy, Articles 91\u201395, which establishes the municipality as the basic territorial entity of Andalusia, each of which has legal personhood and autonomy in many aspects of its internal affairs. At the municipal level, representation, government and administration is performed by the ayuntamiento (municipal government), which has competency for urban planning, community social services, supply and treatment of water, collection and treatment of waste, and promotion of tourism, culture, and sports, among other matters established by law.Among the more important Andalusian cities besides the provincial capitals are:\n\nEl Ejido, N\u00edjar and Roquetas de Mar (Almer\u00eda)\nLa L\u00ednea de la Concepci\u00f3n, Algeciras, Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda, San Fernando, Chiclana de la Frontera, Puerto Real, Arcos de la Frontera, Jerez and El Puerto de Santa Mar\u00eda (C\u00e1diz)\nLucena, Pozoblanco, Montilla and Puente Genil (C\u00f3rdoba)\nAlmu\u00f1\u00e9car, Guadix, Loja and Motril (Granada)\nLinares, And\u00fajar, \u00dabeda and Baeza (Ja\u00e9n)\nMarbella, Mijas, V\u00e9lez-M\u00e1laga, Fuengirola, Torremolinos, Estepona, Benalm\u00e1dena, Antequera, Rinc\u00f3n de la Victoria and Ronda (M\u00e1laga)\nUtrera, Dos Hermanas, Alcal\u00e1 de Guada\u00edra, Osuna, Mairena del Aljarafe, \u00c9cija and Lebrija (Sevilla)In conformity with the intent to devolve control as locally as possible, in many cases, separate nuclei of population within municipal borders each administer their own interests. These are variously known as pedan\u00edas (\"hamlets\"), villas (\"villages\"), aldeas (also usually rendered as \"villages\"), or other similar names.\n\n\n=== Main cities ===\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAndalusia ranks first by population among the 17 autonomous communities of Spain. The estimated population at the beginning of 2009 was 8,285,692. The population is concentrated, above all, in the provincial capitals and along the coasts, so that the level of urbanization is quite high; half the population is concentrated in the 28 cities of more than 50,000 inhabitants. The population is aging, although the process of immigration is countering the inversion of the population pyramid.\n\n\n=== Population change ===\nAt the end of the 20th century, Andalusia was in the last phase of demographic transition. The death rate stagnated at around 8\u20139 per thousand, and the population came to be influenced mainly by birth and migration.\n\nIn 1950, Andalusia had 20.04 percent of the national population of Spain. By 1981, this had declined to 17.09 percent. Although the Andalusian population was not declining in absolute terms, these relative losses were due to emigration great enough to nearly counterbalance having the highest birth rate in Spain. Since the 1980s, this process has reversed on all counts, and as of 2009, Andalusia has 17.82 percent of the Spanish population.\nThe birth rate is sharply down, as is typical in developed economies, although it has lagged behind much of the rest of the world in this respect. Furthermore, prior emigrants have been returning to Andalusia. Beginning in the 1990s, others have been immigrating in large numbers as well, as Spain has become a country of net immigration.At the beginning of the 21st century, statistics show a slight increase in the birth rate, due in large part to the higher birth rate among immigrants. The result is that as of 2009, the trend toward rejuvenation of the population is among the strongest of any autonomous community of Spain, or of any comparable region in Europe.\n\n\n=== Structure ===\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, the population structure of Andalusia shows a clear inversion of the population pyramid, with the largest cohorts falling between ages 25 and 50. Comparison of the population pyramid in 2008 to that in 1986 shows:\n\nA clear decrease in the population under the age of 25, due to a declining birth rate.\nAn increase in the adult population, as the earlier, larger cohort born in the \"baby boom\" of the 1960s and 1970s reach adulthood. This effect has been exacerbated by immigration: the largest contingent of immigrants are young adults.\nA further increase in the adult population, and especially the older adult population, due to increased life expectancy.As far as composition by sex, two aspects stand out: the higher percentage of women in the elderly population, owing to women's longer life expectancy, and, on the other hand, the higher percentage of men of working age, due in large part to a predominantly male immigrant population.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2005, 5.35 percent of the population of Andalusia were born outside of Spain. This is a relatively low number for a Spanish region, the national average being three percentage points higher. The immigrants are not evenly distributed among the Andalusian provinces: Almer\u00eda, with a 15.20 percent immigrant population, is third among all provinces in Spain, while at the other extreme Ja\u00e9n is only 2.07 percent immigrants and C\u00f3rdoba 1.77 percent. The predominant nationalities among the immigrant populations are Moroccan (92,500, constituting 17.79 percent of the foreigners living in Andalusia) and British (15.25 percent across the region). When comparing world regions rather than individual countries, the single largest immigrant block is from the region of Latin America, outnumbering not only all North Africans, but also all non-Spanish Western Europeans. Demographically, this group has provided an important addition to the Andalusian labor force.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nAndalusia is traditionally an agricultural area, but the service sector (particularly tourism, retail sales, and transportation) now predominates. The once booming construction sector, hit hard by the 2009 recession, was also important to the region's economy. The industrial sector is less developed than most other regions in Spain.\nBetween 2000\u20132006 economic growth per annum was 3.72%, one of the highest in the country. Still, according to the Spanish Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica (INE), the GDP per capita of Andalusia (\u20ac17,401; 2006) remains the second lowest in Spain, with only Extremadura lagging behind. The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the autonomous community was 160.6 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 13.4% of Spanish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 20,500 euros or 68% of the EU27 average in the same year.\n\n\n=== Primary sector ===\nThe primary sector, despite adding the least of the three sectors to the regional GDP remains important, especially when compared to typical developed economies. The primary sector produces 8.26 percent of regional GDP, 6.4 percent of its GVA and employs 8.19 percent of the workforce. In monetary terms it could be considered a rather uncompetitive sector, given its level of productivity compared to other Spanish regions. In addition to its numeric importance relative to other regions, agriculture and other primary sector activities have strong roots in local culture and identity.\nThe primary sector is divided into a number of subsectors: agriculture, commercial fishing, animal husbandry, hunting, forestry, mining, and energy.\n\n\n==== Agriculture, husbandry, hunting, and forestry ====\n\nFor many centuries, agriculture dominated Andalusian society, and, with 44.3 percent of its territory cultivated and 8.4 percent of its workforce in agriculture as of 2016 it remains an integral part of Andalusia's economy. However, its importance is declining, like the primary and secondary sectors generally, as the service sector is increasingly taking over. The primary cultivation is dryland farming of cereals and sunflowers without artificial irrigation, especially in the vast countryside of the Guadalquivir valley and the high plains of Granada and Almer\u00eda-with a considerably lesser and more geographically focused cultivation of barley and oats. Using irrigation, maize, cotton and rice are also grown on the banks of the Guadalquivir and Genil.\n\nThe most important tree crops are olives, especially in the Subbetic regions of the provinces of C\u00f3rdoba and J\u00e1en, where irrigated olive orchards constitute a large component of agricultural output. There are extensive vineyards in various zones such as Jerez de la Frontera (sherry), Condado de Huelva, Montilla-Moriles and M\u00e1laga. Fruits\u2014mainly citrus fruits\u2014are grown near the banks of the Guadalquivir; almonds, which require far less water, are grown on the high plains of Granada and Almer\u00eda.In monetary terms, by far the most productive and competitive agriculture in Andalusia is the intensive forced cultivation of strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and other fruits grown under hothouse conditions under clear plastic, often in sandy zones, on the coasts, in Almer\u00eda and Huelva.\n\nOrganic farming has recently undergone rapid expansion in Andalusia, mainly for export to European markets but with increasing demand developing in Spain.Andalusia has a long tradition of animal husbandry and livestock farming, but it is now restricted mainly to mountain meadows, where there is less pressure from other potential uses. Andalusians have a long and colourful history of dog breeding that can be observed throughout the region today. The raising of livestock now plays a semi-marginal role in the Andalusian economy, constituting only 15 percent of the primary sector, half the number for Spain taken as a whole.\"Extensive\" raising of livestock grazes the animals on natural or cultivated pastures, whereas \"intensive\" raising of livestock is based in fodder rather than pasture. Although the productivity is higher than with extensive techniques, the economics are quite different. While intensive techniques now dominate in Europe and even in other regions of Spain, most of Andalusia's cattle, virtually all of its sheep and goats, and a good portion of its pigs are raised by extensive farming in mountain pastures. This includes the Black Iberian pigs that are the source of Jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico. Andalusia's native sheep and goats present a great economic opportunity in a Europe where animal products are generally in strong supply, but the sheep and goat meat, milk, and leather (and the products derived from these) are relatively scarce. Dogs are bred not just as companion animals, but also as herding animals used by goat and sheep herders.\nHunting remains relatively important in Andalusia, but has largely lost its character as a means of obtaining food.\nIt is now more of a leisure activity linked to the mountain areas and complementary to forestry and the raising of livestock. Dogs are frequently used as hunting companions to retrieve killed game.\nThe Andalusian forests are important for their extent\u201450 percent of the territory of Andalusia\u2014and for other less quantifiable environmental reasons, such as their value in preventing erosion, regulating the flow of water necessary for other flora and fauna. For these reasons, there is legislation in place to protect the Andalusian forests. The value of forest products as such constitutes only 2 percent of agricultural production. This comes mostly from cultivated species\u2014eucalyptus in Huelva and poplar in Granada\u2014as well as naturally occurring cork oak in the Sierra Morena.\n\n\n==== Fishing ====\n\nFishing is a longstanding tradition on the Andalusian coasts. Fish and other seafood have long figured prominently in the local diet and in the local gastronomic culture: fried fish (pescaito frito in local dialect), white prawns, almadraba tuna, among others. The Andalusian fishing fleet is Spain's second largest, after Galicia, and Andalusia's 38 fishing ports are the most of any Spanish autonomous community. Commercial fishing produces only 0.5 percent of the product of the regional primary sector by value, but there are areas where it has far greater importance. In the province of Huelva it constitutes 20 percent of the primary sector, and locally in Punta Umbr\u00eda 70 percent of the work force is involved in commercial fishing.Failure to comply with fisheries laws regarding the use of trawling, urban pollution of the seacoast, destruction of habitats by coastal construction (for example, alteration of the mouths of rivers, construction of ports), and diminution of fisheries by overexploitation\nhave created a permanent crisis in the Andalusian fisheries, justifying attempts to convert the fishing fleet. The decrease in fish stocks has led to the rise of aquaculture, including fish farming both on the coasts and in the interior.\n\n\n==== Mining ====\nDespite the general poor returns in recent years, mining retains a certain importance in Andalusia. Andalusia produces half of Spain's mining product by value. Of Andalusia's production, roughly half comes from the province of Huelva. Mining for precious metals at Minas de Riotinto in Huelva (see Rio Tinto Group) dates back to pre-Roman times; the mines were abandoned in the Middle Ages and rediscovered in 1556. Other mining activity is coal mining in the Guadiato valley in the province of C\u00f3rdoba; various metals at Aznalc\u00f3llar in the province of Seville, and iron at Alquife in the province of Granada. In addition, limestone, clay, and other materials used in construction are well distributed throughout Andalusia.\n\n\n=== Secondary sector: industry ===\nThe Andalusian industrial sector has always been relatively small. Nevertheless, in 2007, Andalusian industry earned 11.979 million euros and employed more than 290,000 workers. This represented 9.15 percent of regional GDP, far below the 15.08 the secondary sector represents in the economy of Spain as a whole. By analyzing the different subsectors of the food industry Andalusian industry accounts for more than 16% of total production. In a comparison with the Spanish economy, this subsector is virtually the only food that has some weight in the national economy with 16.16%. Lies far behind the manufacturing sector of shipping materials just over 10% of the Spanish economy. Companies like Cruzcampo (Heineken Group), Puleva, Domecq, Santana Motors or Renault-Andalusia, are exponents of these two subsectors. Of note is the Andalusian aeronautical sector, which is second nationally only behind Madrid and represents approximately 21% of total turnover in terms of employment, highlighting companies like Airbus, Airbus Military, or the newly formed Aerospace Alestis. On the contrary it is symptomatic of how little weight the regional economy in such important sectors such as textiles or electronics at the national level.Andalusian industry is also characterized by a specialization in industrial activities of transforming raw agricultural and mineral materials. This is largely done by small enterprises without the public or foreign investment more typical of a high level of industrialization.\n\n\n=== Tertiary sector: services ===\n\nIn recent decades the Andalusian tertiary (service) sector has grown greatly, and has come to constitute the majority of the regional economy, as is typical of contemporary economies in developed nations. In 1975 the service sector produced 51.1 percent of local GDP and employed 40.8 percent of the work force. In 2007, this had risen to 67.9 percent of GDP and 66.42 percent of jobs. This process of \"tertiarization\" of the economy has followed a somewhat unusual course in Andalusia. This growth occurred somewhat earlier than in most developed economies and occurred independently of the local industrial sector. There were two principal reasons that \"tertiarization\" followed a different course in Andalusia than elsewhere:\n1. Andalusian capital found it impossible to compete in the industrial sector against more developed regions, and was obligated to invest in sectors that were easier to enter.\n2. The absence of an industrial sector that could absorb displaced agricultural workers and artisans led to the proliferation of services with rather low productivity. This unequal development compared to other regions led to a hypertrophied and unproductive service sector, which has tended to reinforce underdevelopment, because it has not led to large accumulations of capital.\n\n\n==== Tourism in Andalusia ====\n\nDue in part to the relatively mild winter and spring climate, the south of Spain is attractive to overseas visitors\u2013especially tourists from Northern Europe. While inland areas such as Ja\u00e9n, C\u00f3rdoba and the hill villages and towns remain relatively untouched by tourism, the coastal areas of Andalusia have heavy visitor traffic for much of the year.\nAmong the autonomous communities, Andalusia is second only to Catalonia in tourism, with nearly 30 million visitors every year. The principal tourist destinations in Andalusia are the Costa del Sol and (secondarily) the Sierra Nevada. As discussed above, Andalusia is one of the sunniest and warmest places in Europe, making it a center of \"sun and sand\" tourism, but not only it. Around 70 percent of the lodging capacity and 75 percent of the nights booked in Andalusian hotels are in coastal municipalities. The largest number of tourists come in August\u201413.26 percent of the nights booked throughout the year\u2014and the smallest number in December\u20145.36 percent.\n\nOn the west (Atlantic) coast are the Costa de la Luz (provinces of Huelva and C\u00e1diz), and on the east (Mediterranean) coast, the Costa del Sol (provinces of C\u00e1diz y M\u00e1laga), Costa Tropical (Granada and part of Almer\u00eda) and the Costa de Almer\u00eda. In 2004, the Blue Flag beach program of the non-profit Foundation for Environmental Education recognized 66 Andalusian beaches and 18 pleasure craft ports as being in a good state of conservation in terms of sustainability, accessibility, and quality. Nonetheless, the level of tourism on the Andalusian coasts has been high enough to have a significant environmental impact, and other organizations\u2014such as the Spanish Ecologists in Action (Ecologistas en Acci\u00f3n) with their description of \"Black Flag beaches\" or Greenpeace\u2014have expressed the opposite sentiment. Still, Hotel chains such as Fuerte Hotels have ensured that sustainability within the tourism industry is one of their highest priorities.Together with \"sand and sun\" tourism, there has also been a strong increase in nature tourism in the interior, as well as cultural tourism, sport tourism, and conventions. One example of sport and nature tourism is the ski resort at Sierra Nevada National Park.\nAs for cultural tourism, there are hundreds of cultural tourist destinations: cathedrals, castles, forts, monasteries, and historic city centers and a wide variety of museums.\nIt can be highlighted that Spain has seven of its 42 cultural UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Andalucia:\n\nAlhambra, Generalife and Albayz\u00edn, Granada (1984,1994)\nAntequera Dolmens Site (2016)\n10th Century Caliphate City of Medina Azahara (2018)\nCathedral, Alc\u00e1zar and Archivo de Indias in Seville (1987)\nHistoric Centre of Cordoba (1984,1994)\nRenaissance Monumental Ensembles of \u00dabeda and Baeza (2003)\nRock Art of the Mediterranean Basin on the Iberian Peninsula (1998)Further, there are the Lugares colombinos, significant places in the life of Christopher Columbus: Palos de la Frontera, La R\u00e1bida Monastery, and Moguer) in the province of Huelva. There are also archeological sites of great interest: the Roman city of Italica, birthplace of Emperor Trajan and (most likely) Hadrian or Baelo Claudia near Tarifa.\n\nAndalusia was the birthplace of such great painters as Vel\u00e1zquez and Murillo (Seville) and, more recently, Picasso (M\u00e1laga); Picasso is memorialized by his native city at the Museo Picasso M\u00e1laga and Natal House Foundation; the Casa de Murillo was a house museum 1982\u20131998, but is now mostly offices for the Andalusian Council of Culture. The CAC M\u00e1laga (Museum of Modern Art) is the most visited museum of Andalusia and has offered exhibitions of artists such as Louise Bourgeois, Jake and Dinos Chapman, Gerhard Richter, Anish Kapoor, Ron Mueck or Rodney Graham. Malaga is also located part of the private Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection at Carmen Thyssen Museum.\nThere are numerous other significant museums around the region, both of paintings and of archeological artifacts such as gold jewelry, pottery and other ceramics, and other works that demonstrate the region's artisanal traditions.\nThe Council of Government has designated the following \"Municipios Tur\u00edsticos\": in Almer\u00eda, Roquetas de Mar; in C\u00e1diz, Chiclana de la Frontera, Chipiona, Conil de la Frontera, Grazalema, Rota, and Tarifa; in Granada, Almu\u00f1\u00e9car; in Huelva, Aracena; in Ja\u00e9n, Cazorla; in M\u00e1laga, Benalm\u00e1dena, Fuengirola, Nerja, Rinc\u00f3n de la Victoria, Ronda, and Torremolinos; in Seville, Santiponce.\n\n\n===== Monuments and features =====\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nThe unemployment rate stood at 25.5% in 2017 and was one of the highest in Spain and Europe.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nAs in any modern society, transport systems are an essential structural element of the functioning of Andalusia. The transportation network facilitates territorial coordination, economic development and distribution, and intercity transportation.In urban transport, underdeveloped public transport systems put pedestrian traffic and other non-motorized traffic are at a disadvantage compared to the use of private vehicles. Several Andalusian capitals\u2014C\u00f3rdoba, Granada and Seville\u2014have recently been trying to remedy this by strengthening their public transport systems and providing a better infrastructure for the use of bicycles. There are now three rapid transit systems operating in Andalucia \u2013 the Seville Metro, M\u00e1laga Metro and Granada Metro. Cercan\u00edas commuter rail networks operate in Seville, M\u00e1laga and C\u00e1diz.\n\nFor over a century, the conventional rail network has been centralized on the regional capital, Seville, and the national capital, Madrid; in general, there are no direct connections between provincial capitals. High-speed AVE trains run from Madrid via C\u00f3rdoba to Seville and M\u00e1laga, from which a branch from Antequera to Granada opened in 2019. Further AVE routes are under construction. The Madrid-C\u00f3rdoba-Seville route was the first high-velocity route in Spain (operating since 1992). Other principal routes are the one from Algeciras to Seville and from Almer\u00eda via Granada to Madrid.\nMost of the principal roads have been converted into limited access highways known as autov\u00edas. The Autov\u00eda del Este (Autov\u00eda A-4) runs from Madrid through the Despe\u00f1aperros Natural Park, then via Bail\u00e9n, C\u00f3rdoba, and Seville to C\u00e1diz, and is part of European route E05 in the International E-road network. The other main road in the region is the portion of European route E15, which runs as the Autovia del Mediterr\u00e1neo along the Spanish Mediterranean coast. Parts of this constitute the superhighway Autopista AP-7, while in other areas it is Autov\u00eda A-7. Both of these roads run generally east\u2013west, although the Autov\u00eda A-4 turns to the south in western Andalusia.\nOther first-order roads include the Autov\u00eda A-48 roughly along the Atlantic coast from C\u00e1diz to Algeciras, continuing European route E05 to meet up with European route E15; the Autov\u00eda del Quinto Centenario (Autov\u00eda A-49), which continues west from Seville (where the Autov\u00eda A-4 turns toward the south) and goes on to Huelva and into Portugal as European route E01; the Autov\u00eda Ruta de la Plata (Autov\u00eda A-66), European route E803, which roughly corresponds to the ancient Roman 'Silver Route' from the mines of northern Spain, and runs north from Seville; the Autov\u00eda de M\u00e1laga (Autov\u00eda A-45), which runs south from C\u00f3rdoba to M\u00e1laga; and the Autov\u00eda de Sierra Nevada (Autov\u00eda A-44), part of European route E902, which runs south from Ja\u00e9n to the Mediterranean coast at Motril.\n\nAs of 2008 Andalusia has six public airports, all of which can legally handle international flights. The M\u00e1laga Airport is dominant, handling 60.67 percent of passengers and 85 percent of its international traffic. The Seville Airport handles another 20.12 percent of traffic, and the Jerez Airport 7.17 percent, so that these three airports account for 87.96 percent of traffic.M\u00e1laga Airport is the international airport that offers a wide variety of international destinations. It has a daily link with twenty cities in Spain and over a hundred cities in Europe (mainly in Great Britain, Central Europe and the Nordic countries but also the main cities of Eastern Europe: Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Sofia, Riga or Bucharest), North Africa, Middle East (Riyadh, Jeddah and Kuwait) and North America (New York, Toronto and Montreal).\n\nThe main ports are Algeciras (for freight and container traffic) and M\u00e1laga for cruise ships. Algeciras is Spain's leading commercial port, with 60,000,000 tonnes (66,000,000 short tons) of cargo in 2004. Seville has Spain's only commercial river port. Other significant commercial ports in Andalusia are the ports of the Bay of C\u00e1diz, Almer\u00eda and Huelva.\nThe Council of Government has approved a Plan of Infrastructures for the Sustainability of Transport in Andalusia (PISTA) 2007\u20132013, which plans an investment of 30 billion euros during that period.\n\n\n=== Energy infrastructure ===\nThe lack of high-quality fossil fuels in Andalusia has led to a strong dependency on petroleum imports. Still, Andalusia has a strong potential for the development of renewable energy, above all wind energy. The Andalusian Energy Agency established in 2005 by the autonomous government, is a new governmental organ charged with the development of energy policy and provision of a sufficient supply of energy for the community.The infrastructure for production of electricity consists of eight large thermal power stations, more than 70 hydroelectric power plants, two wind farms, and 14 major cogeneration facilities. Historically, the largest Andalusian business in this sector was the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Sevillana de Electricidad, founded in 1894, absorbed into Endesa in 1996.\n\nThe Solar power tower PS10 was built by the Andalusian firm Abengoa in Sanl\u00facar la Mayor in the province of Seville, and began operating in March 2007. It is the largest existing solar power facility in Europe. Smaller solar power stations, also recent, exist at C\u00fallar and Galera, Granada, inaugurated by Geosol and Caja Granada. Two more large thermosolar facilities, Andasol I y II, planned at Hoya de Guadix in the province of Granada are expected to supply electricity to half a million households. The Plataforma Solar de Almer\u00eda (PSA) in the Tabernas Desert is an important center for the exploration of the solar energy.The largest wind power firm in the region is the Sociedad E\u00f3lica de Andaluc\u00eda, formed by the merger of Planta E\u00f3lica del Sur S.A. and Energ\u00eda E\u00f3lica del Estrecho S.A.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nAs throughout Spain, basic education in Andalusia is free and compulsory. Students are required to complete ten years of schooling, and may not leave school before the age of 16, after which students may continue on to a baccalaureate, to intermediate vocational education, to intermediate-level schooling in arts and design, to intermediate sports studies, or to the working world.\nAndalusia has a tradition of higher education dating back to the Modern Age and the University of Granada, University of Baeza, and University of Osuna.\nAs of 2009, there are ten private or public universities in Andalucia. University studies are structured in cycles, awarding degrees based on ECTS credits in accord with the Bologna process, which the Andalusian universities are adopting in accord with the other universities of the European Higher Education Area.\n\n\n=== Healthcare ===\n\nResponsibility for healthcare jurisdictions devolved from the Spanish government to Andalusia with the enactment of the Statute of Autonomy. Thus, the Andalusian Health Service (Servicio Andaluz de Salud) currently manages almost all public health resources of the Community, with such exceptions as health resources for prisoners and members of the military, which remain under central administration.\n\n\n=== Science and technology ===\nAccording to the Outreach Program for Science in Andalusia, Andalusia contributes 14 percent of Spain's scientific production behind only Madrid and Catalonia among the autonomous communities, even though regional investment in research and development (R&D) as a proportion of GDP is below the national average. The lack of research capacity in business and the low participation of the private sector in research has resulted in R&D taking place largely in the public sector.\nThe Council of Innovation, Science and Business is the organ of the autonomous government responsible for universities, research, technological development, industry, and energy. The council coordinates and initiates scientific and technical innovation through specialized centers an initiatives such as the Andalusian Center for Marine Science and Technology (Centro Andaluz de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda Marina) and Technological Corporation of Andalusia (Corporaci\u00f3n Tecnol\u00f3gica de Andaluc\u00eda).\nWithin the private sphere, although also promoted by public administration, technology parks have been established throughout the Community, such as the Technological Park of Andalucia (Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Andaluc\u00eda) in Campanillas on the outskirts of M\u00e1laga, and Cartuja 93 in Seville. Some of these parks specialize in specific sector, such as Aer\u00f3polis in aerospace or Geolit in food technology. The Andalusian government deployed 600,000 Ubuntu desktop computers in their schools.\n\n\n== Media ==\nAndalusia has international, national, regional, and local media organizations, which are active gathering and disseminating information (as well as creating and disseminating entertainment).\nThe most notable is the public Radio y Televisi\u00f3n de Andaluc\u00eda (RTVA), broadcasting on two regional television channels, Canal Sur and Canal Sur 2, four regional radio stations, Canal Sur Radio, Canal Fiesta Radio, Radio Andaluc\u00eda Informaci\u00f3n and Canal Flamenco Radio, as well as various digital signals, most notably Canal Sur Andaluc\u00eda available on cable TV throughout Spain.\n\n\n=== Newspapers ===\nDifferent newspapers are published for each Andalusian provincial capital, comarca, or important city. Often, the same newspaper organization publishes different local editions with much shared content, with different mastheads and different local coverage. There are also popular papers distributed without charge, again typically with local editions that share much of their content.\nNo single Andalusian newspaper is distributed throughout the region, not even with local editions. In eastern Andalusia the Diario Ideal has editions tailored for the provinces of Almer\u00eda, Granada, and Ja\u00e9n. Grupo Joly is based in Andalucia, backed by Andalusian capital, and publishes eight daily newspapers there. Efforts to create a newspaper for the entire autonomous region have not succeeded (the most recent as of 2009 was the Diario de Andaluc\u00eda). The national press (El Pa\u00eds, El Mundo, ABC, etc.) include sections or editions specific to Andalusia.\n\n\n=== Public television ===\n\nAndalusia has two public television stations, both operated by Radio y Televisi\u00f3n de Andaluc\u00eda (RTVA):\n\nCanal Sur first broadcast on 28 February 1989 (D\u00eda de Andaluc\u00eda).\nCanal Sur 2 first broadcast 5 June 1998. Programming focuses on culture, sports, and programs for children and youth.In addition, RTVA also operates the national and international cable channel Canal Sur Andaluc\u00eda, which first broadcast in 1996 as Andaluc\u00eda Televisi\u00f3n.\n\n\n=== Radio ===\nThere are four public radio stations in the region, all operated by RTVA:\n\nCanal Sur Radio, first broadcast October 1988.\nRadio Andaluc\u00eda Informaci\u00f3n, first broadcast September 1998.\nCanal Fiesta Radio, first broadcast January 2001.\nCanal Flamenco Radio, first broadcast 29 September 2008.\n\n\n== Art and culture ==\n\nThe patrimony of Andalusia has been shaped by its particular history and geography, as well as its complex flows of population. Andalusia has been home to a succession of peoples and civilizations, many very different from one another, each impacting the settled inhabitants. The ancient Iberians were followed by Celts, Phoenicians and other Eastern Mediterranean traders, Romans, migrating Germanic tribes, Arabs or Berbers. All have shaped the Spanish patrimony in Andalusia, which was already diffused widely in the literary and pictorial genre of the costumbrismo andaluz.In the 19th century, Andalusian culture came to be widely viewed as the Spanish culture par excellence, in part thanks to the perceptions of romantic travellers. In the words of Ortega y Gasset:\n\nAndalusia, which has never shown the swagger nor petulancy of particularism; that has never pretended to the status of a State apart, is, of all the Spanish regions, the one that possesses a culture most radically its own. Throughout the 19th century, Spain has submitted itself to the hegemonic influence of Andalusia. That century began with the Cortes of C\u00e1diz; it ended with the assassination of C\u00e1novas del Castillo, malague\u00f1o [from M\u00e1laga], and the exaltation of Silvela, no less malague\u00f1o. The dominant ideas have an Andalusian accent. One paints Andalusia: a roof-terrace, some flowerpots, blue sky. One reads southern authors. One speaks at all times of the \"land of the Most Holy Virgin Mary\". The thief from the Sierra Morena and the smuggler are national heroes. All Spain feels its existence justified by the honor of having on its flanks the Andalusian piece of the planet. Around 1900, like so many other things, this changes. The North sits up.\n\n\n=== Arts ===\n\nAndalusia has been the birthplace of many great artists: the classic painters Vel\u00e1zquez, Murillo, and Juan de Vald\u00e9s Leal; the sculptors Juan Mart\u00ednez Monta\u00f1\u00e9s, Alonso Cano and Pedro de Mena; and such modern painters as Daniel V\u00e1zquez D\u00edaz and Pablo Picasso.\nThe Spanish composer Manuel de Falla was from C\u00e1diz and incorporated typical Andalusian melodies in his works, as did Joaqu\u00edn Turina, from Seville. The great singer Camar\u00f3n de la Isla was born in San Fernando, C\u00e1diz, and Andr\u00e9s Segovia who helped shape the romantic-modernist approach to classical guitar, was born in Linares, Ja\u00e9n. The virtuoso Flamenco guitar player Paco de Lucia who helped internationalize Flamenco, was born in Algeciras, Cadiz.\n\n\n==== Architecture ====\n\nSince the Neolithic era, Andalusia has preserved important megaliths, such as the dolmens at the Cueva de Menga and the Dolmen de Viera, both at Antequera. Archeologists have found Bronze Age cities at Los Millares and El Argar. Archeological digs at Do\u00f1a Blanca in El Puerto de Santa Mar\u00eda have revealed the oldest Phoenicians city in the Iberian peninsula; major ruins have also been revealed at Roman Italica near Seville.Some of the greatest architecture in Andalusia were developed across several centuries and civilizations. Such is the case of the Alhambra complex or the Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba.\n\nThe traditional architecture of Andalusia retains its Roman with added Persian and Egyptian influences brought by Arabs, with a marked Mediterranean character strongly conditioned by the climate. Traditional urban houses are constructed with shared walls to minimize exposure to high exterior temperatures. Solid exterior walls are painted with lime to minimize the heating effects of the sun. In accord with the climate and tradition of each area, the roofs may be terraces or tiled in the Roman imbrex and tegula style. One of the most characteristic elements (and one of the most obviously influenced by Roman architecture) is the interior patio or courtyard; the patios of C\u00f3rdoba are particularly famous. Other characteristic elements are decorative (and functional) wrought iron gratings and the tiles known as azulejos. Landscaping\u2014both for common private homes and homes on a more lavish scale\u2014also carries on older traditions, with plants, flowers, and fountains, pools, and streams of water. Beyond these general elements, there are also specific local architectural styles, such as the flat roofs, roofed chimneys, and radically extended balconies of the Alpujarra, the cave dwellings of Guadix and of Granada's Sacromonte, or the traditional architecture of the Marquisate of Zenete.\nThe monumental architecture of the centuries immediately after the Reconquista often displayed an assertion of Christian hegemony through architecture that referenced non-Arab influences. Some of the greatest Renaissance buildings in Andalusia are from the then-kingdom of Ja\u00e9n: the Ja\u00e9n Cathedral, designed in part by Andr\u00e9s de Vandelvira, served as a model for the Cathedral of Malaga and Guadix; the centers of \u00dabeda and Baeza, dating largely from this era, are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Seville and its kingdom also figured prominently in this era, as is shown by the Casa consistorial de Sevilla, the Hospital de las Cinco Llagas, or the Charterhouse of Jerez de la Frontera. The Palace of Charles V in Granada is uniquely important for its Italianate purism. Andalusia also has such Baroque-era buildings as the Palace of San Telmo in Seville (seat of the current autonomic presidency), the Church of Our Lady of Reposo in Campillos, and the Granada Charterhouse. Academicism gave the region the Royal Tobacco Factory in Seville and Neoclassicism the nucleus of C\u00e1diz, such as its city hall, Royal Prison, and the Oratorio de la Santa Cueva.Revivalist architecture in the 19th and 20th centuries contributed the buildings of the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929 in Seville, including the Neo-Mud\u00e9jar Plaza de Espa\u00f1a. Andalusia also preserves an important industrial patrimony related to various economic activities.\nBesides the architecture of the cities, there is also much outstanding rural architecture: houses, as well as ranch and farm buildings and dog houses.\n\n\n==== Sculpture ====\n\nThe Iberian reliefs of Osuna, Lady of Baza, and Le\u00f3n de Bujalance, the Phoenician sarcophagi of C\u00e1diz, and the Roman sculptures of the Baetic cities such as Italica give evidence of traditions of sculpture in Andalusia dating back to antiquity. There are few significant surviving sculptures from the time of al-Andalus; two notable exceptions are the lions of the Alhambra and of the Marist\u00e1n of Granada (the Nasrid hospital in the Albaic\u00edn).\nThe Sevillian school of sculpture dating from the 13th century onward and the Granadan school beginning toward the end of the 16th century both focused primarily on Christian religious subject matter, including many wooden altarpieces. Notable sculptors in these traditions include Lorenzo Mercadante de Breta\u00f1a, Pedro Mill\u00e1n, Juan Mart\u00ednez Monta\u00f1\u00e9s, Pedro Rold\u00e1n, Jos\u00e9 de Arce, Jer\u00f3nimo Balb\u00e1s, Alonso Cano, and Pedro de Mena.Non-religious sculpture has also existed in Andalusia since antiquity. A fine example from the Renaissance era is the decoration of the Casa de Pilatos in Seville. Nonetheless, non-religious sculpture played a relatively minor role until such 19th-century sculptors as Antonio Susillo.\n\n\n==== Painting ====\n\nAs in sculpture, there were Sevillian and the Granadan schools of painting. The former has figured prominently in the history of Spanish art since the 15th century and includes such important artists as Zurbar\u00e1n, Vel\u00e1zquez and Murillo, as well as theoreticians of art such as Francisco Pacheco. The Museum of Fine Arts of Seville and the Prado contain numerous representative works of the Sevillian school of painting.\nA specific romantic genre known as costumbrismo andaluz depicts traditional and folkloric Andalusian subjects, such as bullfighting scenes, dogs, and scenes from Andalusia's history. Important artists in this genre include Manuel Barr\u00f3n, Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Ramos, Gonzalo Bilbao and Julio Romero de Torres. The genre is well represented in the private Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection, part of which is on display at Madrid's Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum and Carmen Thyssen Museum in M\u00e1laga.M\u00e1laga also has been and is an important artistic center. Its most illustrious representative was Pablo Picasso, one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. The city has a Museum and Natal House Foundation, dedicated to the painter.\n\n\n=== Literature and philosophy ===\n\nAndalusia plays a significant role in the history of Spanish-language literature, although not all of the important literature associated with Andalusia was written in Spanish. Before 1492, there was the literature written in Andalusian Arabic. Hispano-Arabic authors native to the region include Ibn Hazm, Ibn Zayd\u00fan, Ibn Tufail, Al-Mu'tamid, Ibn al-Khatib, Ibn al-Yayyab, and Ibn Zamrak or Andalusian Hebrew poets as Solomon ibn Gabirol. Ibn Quzman, of the 12th century, crafted poems in the colloquial Andalusian language.In 1492 Antonio de Nebrija published his celebrated Gram\u00e1tica de la lengua castellana (\"Grammar of the Castilian language\"), the first such work for a modern European language. In 1528 Francisco Delicado wrote La lozana andaluza, a novel in the orbit of La Celestina, and in 1599 the Sevillian Mateo Alem\u00e1n wrote the first part of Guzm\u00e1n de Alfarache, the first picaresque novel with a known author.\nThe prominent humanist literary school of Seville included such writers as Juan de Mal Lara, Fernando de Herrera, Gutierre de Cetina, Luis Barahona de Soto, Juan de la Cueva, Gonzalo Argote de Molina, and Rodrigo Caro. The Cordoban Luis de G\u00f3ngora was the greatest exponent of the culteranismo of Baroque poetry in the Siglo de Oro; indeed, the style is often referred to as G\u00f3ngorismo.\nLiterary Romanticism in Spain had one of its great centers in Andalusia, with such authors as \u00c1ngel de Saavedra, 3rd Duke of Rivas, Jos\u00e9 Cadalso and Gustavo Adolfo B\u00e9cquer. Costumbrismo andaluz existed in literature as much as in visual art, with notable examples being the Escenas andaluzas of Seraf\u00edn Est\u00e9banez Calder\u00f3n and the works of Pedro Antonio de Alarc\u00f3n.\nAndalusian authors \u00c1ngel Ganivet, Manuel G\u00f3mez-Moreno, Manuel and Antonio Machado, and Francisco Villaespesa are all generally counted in the Generation of '98. Also of this generation were the Quintero brothers, dramatists who faithfully captured Andalusian dialects and idiosyncrasies. Also of note, 1956 Nobel Prize-winning poet Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez was a native of Moguer, near Huelva.\n\nA large portion of the avant-garde Generation of '27 who gathered at the Ateneo de Sevilla on the 300th anniversary of G\u00f3ngora's death were Andalusians: Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, Luis Cernuda, Rafael Alberti, Manuel Altolaguirre, Emilio Prados, and 1977 Nobel laureate Vicente Aleixandre.Certain Andalusian fictional characters have become universal archetypes: Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e's gypsy Carmen, P. D. Eastman's Perro, Pierre Beaumarchais's F\u00edgaro, and Tirso de Molina's Don Juan.\nAs in most regions of Spain, the principal form of popular verse is the romance, although there are also strophes specific to Andalusia, such as the sole\u00e1 or the soleariya. Ballads, lullabies, street vendor's cries, nursery rhymes, and work songs are plentiful.\nAmong the philosophers native to the region can be counted Seneca, Avicebron, Maimonides, Averroes, Fern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez de Oliva, Sebasti\u00e1n Fox Morcillo, \u00c1ngel Ganivet, Francisco Giner de los R\u00edos and Mar\u00eda Zambrano.\n\n\n=== Music of Andalusia ===\n\nThe music of Andalusia includes traditional and contemporary music, folk and composed music, and ranges from flamenco to rock. Conversely, certain metric, melodic and harmonic characteristics are considered Andalusian even when written or performed by musicians from elsewhere.\nFlamenco, perhaps the most characteristically Andalusian genre of music and dance, originated in the 18th century, but is based in earlier forms from the region. The influence of the traditional music and dance of the Romani people or Gypsies is particularly clear. The genre embraces distinct vocal (cante flamenco), guitar (toque flamenco), and dance (baile flamenco) styles.The Andalusian Statute of Autonomy reflects the cultural importance of flamenco in its Articles 37.1.18 and 68:\n\nGuiding principles of public policy: 18th The preservation and enhancement of the cultural, historic and artistic heritage of Andalusia, especially flamenco.\nAlso within the Autonomous Community (of Andalucia) is the exclusive competence in knowledge, conservation, research, training, promotion and dissemination of flamenco as a unique element of the Andalusian cultural heritage.\n\nFundamental in the history of Andalusian music are the composers Crist\u00f3bal de Morales, Francisco Guerrero, Francisco Correa de Arauxo, Manuel Garc\u00eda, Manuel de Falla, Joaqu\u00edn Turina, and Manuel Castillo, as well as one of the fathers of modern classical guitar, the guitarist Andr\u00e9s Segovia. Mention should also be made of the great folk artists of the copla (music) and the cante hondo, such as Roc\u00edo Jurado, Lola Flores (La Faraona, \"the pharaoh\"), Juanito Valderrama and the revolutionary Camar\u00f3n de la Isla.Prominent Andalusian rock groups include Triana and Medina Azahara. The duo Los del R\u00edo from Dos Hermanas had international success with their \"Macarena\", including playing at a Super Bowl half-time show in the United States, where their song has also been used as campaign music by the Democratic Party. Other notables include the singer, songwriter, and poet Joaqu\u00edn Sabina, Isabel Pantoja, Rosa L\u00f3pez, who represented Spain at Eurovision in 2002, and David Bisbal.\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\nThe portrayal of Andalusia in film is often reduced to archetypes: flamenco, bullfighting, Catholic pageantry, brigands, the property-rich and cash-poor se\u00f1orito andaluz and emigrants. These images particularly predominated from the 1920s through the 1960s, and helped to consolidate a clich\u00e9d image of the region. In a very different vein, the province of Almer\u00eda was the filming location for many Westerns, especially (but by no means exclusively) the Italian-directed Spaghetti Westerns. During the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, this was the extent of the film industry in Andalusia.\nNonetheless, Andalusian film has roots as far back as Jos\u00e9 Val del Omar in the pre-Franco years, and since the Spanish transition to democracy has brought forth numerous nationally and internationally respected directors: Antonio Cuadri (Heart of the Earth), Chus Guti\u00e9rrez (Poniente), Chiqui Carabante (Carlos Against the World), Alberto Rodr\u00edguez (7 Virgins), Benito Zambrano (Solas), and Antonio Banderas (Summer Rain).\nCounting together feature films, documentaries, television programs, music videos etc., Andalusia has boomed from 37 projects shooting in 1999 to 1,054 in 2007, with the figure for 2007 including 19 feature films. Although feature films are the most prestigious, commercials and television are currently more economically important to the region.\nThe Filmoteca de Andaluc\u00eda, headquartered in C\u00f3rdoba, is a government-run entity in charge of the investigation, collection and diffusion of Andalusian cinematic heritage. Other important contributors to this last activity are such annual film festivals as the M\u00e1laga Film Festival (Festival de M\u00e1laga Cine Espa\u00f1ol (FMCE)), the most important festival dedicated exclusively to cinema made in Spain, the Seville Festival of European Film (SFCE), the International Festival of Short Films\u2014Almer\u00eda in Short, the Huelva Festival of Latin American Film, the Atlantic Film Show in C\u00e1diz, the Islantilla Festival of Film and Television and the African Film Festival of Tarifa.\n\n\n=== Culture ===\n\n\n==== Customs and society ====\n\nEach sub-region in Andalusia has its own unique customs that represent a fusion of Catholicism and local folklore. Cities like Almer\u00eda have been influenced historically by both Granada and Murcia in the use of traditional head coverings.  The sombrero de Labrador, a worker's hat made of black velvet, is a signature style of the region.\nIn C\u00e1diz, traditional costumes with rural origins are worn at bullfights and at parties on the large estates. The tablao flamenco dance and the accompanying cante jondo vocal style originated in Andalusia and traditionally most often performed by the gypsy Romani. One of the most distinctive cultural events in Andalusia is the Romer\u00eda de El Roc\u00edo in May. It consists of a pilgrimage to the Hermitage of El Roc\u00edo in the countryside near Almonte, in honor of the Virgin of El Roc\u00edo, an image of the Virgin and Child. In recent times the Romer\u00eda has attracted roughly a million pilgrims each year.In Ja\u00e9n, the saeta is a revered form of Spanish religious song, whose form and style has evolved over many centuries. Saetas evoke strong emotion and are sung most often during public processions. Verdiales, based upon the fandango, are a flamenco music style and song form originating in Almogia, near M\u00e1laga. For this reason, the Verdiales are sometimes known as Fandangos de M\u00e1laga. The region also has a rich musical tradition of flamenco songs, or palos called cartageneras. Seville celebrates Semana Santa, one of the better known religious events within Spain. During the festival, religious fraternities dress as penitents and carry large floats of lifelike wooden sculptures representing scenes of the Passion, and images of the Virgin Mary. Sevillanas, a type of old folk music sung and written in Seville and still very popular, are performed in fairs and festivals, along with an associated dance for the music, the Baile por sevillanas. All the different regions of Andalusia have developed their own distinctive customs, but all share a connectedness to Catholicism as developed during baroque Spain society.\n\n\n==== Andalusian Spanish ====\n\nAndalusian Spanish is one of the most widely spoken forms of Spanish in Spain, and because of emigration patterns was very influential on American Spanish. Rather than a single dialect, it is really a range of dialects sharing some common features; among these is the retention of more Arabic words than elsewhere in Spain, as well as some phonological differences compared with Standard Spanish. The isoglosses that mark the borders of Andalusian Spanish overlap to form a network of divergent boundaries, so there is no clear border for the linguistic region.\n\n\n==== Religion ====\n\nThe territory now known as Andalusia fell within the sphere of influence of ancient Mediterranean mythological beliefs. Phoenician colonization brought the cults of Baal and Melqart; the latter lasted into Roman times as Hercules, mythical founder of both C\u00e1diz and Seville. The Islote de Sancti Petri held the supposed tomb of Hercules, with representations of his Twelve labors; the region was the traditional site of the tenth labor, obtaining the cattle of the monster Geryon. Traditionally, the Pillars of Hercules flank the Strait of Gibraltar. Clearly, the European pillar is the Rock of Gibraltar; the African pillar was presumably either Monte Hacho in Ceuta or Jebel Musa in Morocco. The Roman road that led from C\u00e1diz to Rome was known by several names, one of them being Via Herculea, Hercules route returning from his tenth labor. The present coat of arms of Andalusia shows Hercules between two lions, with two pillars behind these figures.\nRoman Catholicism is, by far, the largest religion in Andalusia. In 2012, the proportion of Andalusians that identify themselves as Roman Catholic was 78.8%. The principal characteristic of the local popular form of Catholicism is devotion to the Virgin Mary; Andalusia is sometimes known as la tierra de Mar\u00eda Sant\u00edsima (\"the land of Most Holy Mary\"). Also characteristic are the processions during Holy Week, in which thousands of penitents (known as nazarenos) sing saetas. Andalusia is the site of such pilgrim destinations as the Santuario de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Cabeza in And\u00fajar and the Hermitage of El Roc\u00edo in Almonte.\n\n\n==== Bullfighting ====\n\nWhile some trace the lineage of the Spanish Fighting Bull back to Roman times, today's fighting bulls in the Iberian peninsula and in the former Spanish Empire trace back to Andalusia in the 15th and 16th centuries. Andalusia remains a center of bull-rearing and bullfighting: its 227 fincas de ganado where fighting bulls are raised cover 146,917 hectares (363,040 acres). In the year 2000, Andalusia's roughly 100 bullrings hosted 1,139 corridas.The oldest bullring still in use in Spain is the neoclassical Plaza de toros in Ronda, built in 1784. The Andalusian Autonomous Government sponsors the Rutas de Andaluc\u00eda taurina, a touristic route through the region centered on bullfighting.\n\n\n==== Festivals ====\n\nThe Andalusian festivals provide a showcase for popular arts and traditional costume. Among the most famous of these are the Seville Fair or Feria de Abril in Seville, now echoed by smaller fairs in Madrid and Barcelona, both of which have many Andalusian immigrants; the Feria de Agosto in M\u00e1laga; the Feria de Jerez or Feria del Caballo in Jerez; the Festival of Corpus Christi in Granada; the Feria de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Salud in C\u00f3rdoba; the Columbian Festivals (Fiestas Colombinas) in Huelva; the Feria de la Virgen del Mar in Almer\u00eda; and the Feria de San Lucas in Ja\u00e9n, among many others.\nFestivals of a religious nature are a deep Andalusian tradition and are met with great popular fervor. There are numerous major festivals during Holy Week. An annual pilgrimage brings a million visitors to the Hermitage of El Roc\u00edo in Almonte (population 16,914 in 2008); similarly large crowds visit the Santuario de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Cabeza in And\u00fajar every April.\nOther important festivals are the Carnival of C\u00e1diz and the Fiesta de las Cruces or Cruz de mayo in Granada and C\u00f3rdoba; in C\u00f3rdoba this is combined with a competition for among the patios (courtyards) of the city.\nAndalusia hosts an annual festival for the dance of flamenco in the summer-time.\n\n\n==== Cuisine ====\n\nThe Andalusian diet varies, especially between the coast and the interior, but in general is a Mediterranean diet based on olive oil, cereals, legumes, vegetables, fish, dried fruits and nuts, and meat; there is also a great tradition of drinking wine.Fried fish\u2014pesca\u00edto frito\u2014and seafood are common on the coast and also eaten well into the interior under coastal influence. Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) from the Almadraba areas of the Gulf of C\u00e1diz, prawns from Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda (known as langostino de Sanl\u00facar), and deepwater rose shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris) from Huelva are all highly prized. Fishing for the transparent goby or chanquete (Aphia minuta), a once-popular small fish from M\u00e1laga, is now banned because the techniques used to catch them trap too many immature fish of other species.The mountainous regions of the Sierra Morena and Sierra Nevada produce cured hams, notably including jam\u00f3n serrano and jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico. These come from two different types of pig, (jam\u00f3n serrano from white pigs, the more expensive jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico from the Black Iberian pig). There are several denominaciones de origen, each with its own specifications including in just which microclimate region ham of a particular denomination must be cured. Plato alpujarre\u00f1o is another mountain specialty, a dish combining ham, sausage, sometimes other pork, egg, potatoes, and olive oil.\nConfectionery is popular in Andalusia. Almonds and honey are common ingredients. Many enclosed convents of nuns make and sell pastries, especially Christmas pastries: mantecados, polvorones, pesti\u00f1os, alfajores, yemas de San Leandro, as well as churros or tejeringos, meringue cookies (merengadas), and amarguillos.\nCereal-based dishes include migas de harina in eastern Andalusia (a similar dish to couscous rather than the fried breadcrumb based migas elsewhere in Spain) and a sweeter, more aromatic porridge called pole\u00e1 in western Andalusia.\nVegetables form the basis of such dishes as alboron\u00eda (similar to ratatouille) and the chopped salad known as pipirrana or piri\u00f1aca. Hot and cold soups based in olive oil, garlic, bread, tomato and peppers include gazpacho, salmorejo, porra antequerana, ajo caliente, sopa campera, or\u2014using almonds instead of tomato\u2014ajoblanco.Wine has a privileged place at the Andalusian table. Andalusian wines are known worldwide, especially fortified wines such as sherry (jerez), aged in soleras. These are enormously varied; for example, dry sherry may be the very distinct fino, manzanilla, amontillado, oloroso, or Palo Cortado and each of these varieties can each be sweetened with Pedro Xim\u00e9nez or Moscatel to produce a different variety of sweet sherry. Besides sherry, Andaluc\u00eda has five other denominaciones de origen for wine: D.O. Condado de Huelva, D.O. Manzanilla-Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda, D.O. M\u00e1laga, D.O. Montilla-Moriles, and D.O. Sierras de M\u00e1laga. Most Andalusian wine comes from one of these regions, but there are other historic wines without a Protected Geographical Status, for example Tintilla de Rota, Pajarete, Moscatel de Chipiona and Mosto de Umbrete.\nAndalusia also produces D.O. vinegar and brandy: D.O. Vinagre de Jerez and D.O. Brandy de Jerez.\n\n\n==== Other traditions ====\n\nThe traditional dress of 18th-century Andalusia was strongly influenced by majismo within the context of casticismo (purism, traditionalism, authenticity). The archetype of the majo and maja was that of a bold, pure Spaniard from a lower-class background, somewhat flamboyant in his or her style of dress. This emulation of lower-class dress also extended to imitating the clothes of brigands and Romani (\"Gypsy\") women.\n\nThe Museum of Arts and Traditions of Sevilla  has collected representative samples of a great deal of the history of Andalusian dress, including examples of such notable types of hat as the sombrero cordob\u00e9s, sombrero cala\u00f1\u00e9s, sombrero de catite and the pavero, as well as the traje corto and traje de flamenca.\nAndalusia has a great artisan tradition in tile, leather (see Shell cordovan), weaving (especially of the heavy jarapa cloth), marquetry, and ceramics (especially in Ja\u00e9n, Granada, and Almer\u00eda), lace (especially Granada and Huelva), embroidery (in And\u00e9valo), ironwork, woodworking, and basketry in wicker, many of these traditions a heritage of the long period of Muslim rule.Andalusia is also known for its dogs, particularly the Andalusian Hound, which was originally bred in the region. Dogs, not just andalusian hounds, are very popular in the region.\nAndalusian equestrianism, institutionalized in the Royal Andalusian School of Equestrian Art is known well beyond the borders of Spain. The Andalusian horse is strongly built, compact yet elegant, distinguished in the area of dressage and show jumping, and is also an excellent horse for driving. They are known for their elegant \"dancing\" gait.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Team sports ===\n\nIn Andalusia, as throughout Spain, football is the predominant sport. Introduced to Spain by British men who worked in mining for Rio Tinto in the province of Huelva, the sport soon became popular with the local population. As Spain's oldest existing football club, Recreativo de Huelva, founded 1889, is known as El Decano (\"the Dean\").For the 2019/20 season, 3 Andalusian clubs will compete in Spain's First Division La Liga: Granada CF, Real Betis, and Sevilla FC. Betis won La Liga in 1934\u201335 and Sevilla in the 1945\u201346 season. The seven other Andalusian teams, C\u00e1diz CF, C\u00f3rdoba CF, UD Almer\u00eda and M\u00e1laga CF play in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n, whilst Recreativo de Huelva, Spain's oldest club and Marbella FC participate in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B, and Real Ja\u00e9n participates in the Tercera Divisi\u00f3n.\nThe Andalusia autonomous football team is not in any league, and plays only friendly matches. In recent years, they have played mostly during the Christmas break of the football leagues. They play mostly against national teams from other countries, but would not be eligible for international league play, where Spain is represented by a single national team.\nIn recent decades, basketball has become increasingly popular, with CB M\u00e1laga, also known as Unicaja M\u00e1laga who have won the Liga ACB in 2007 and the Kora\u0107 Cup in 2001 and usually play the Euroleague, CB Sevilla (Banca C\u00edvica) and CB Granada competing at the top level in the Liga ACB.Unlike basketball, handball has never really taken off in Andalusia. There is one Andalusian team in the Liga Asobal, Spain's premier handball league: BM Puente Genil, playing in the province of C\u00f3rdoba.\nAndalusia's strongest showing in sports has been in table tennis. There are two professional teams: Cajasur Priego TM and Caja Granada TM, the latter being Spain's leading table tennis team, with more than 20 league championships in nearly consecutive years and 14 consecutive Copas del Rey, dominating the Liga ENEB\u00c9. Cajasur is also one of the league's leading teams.\n\n\n=== Olympics ===\n\n220 Andalusian athletes have competed in a total of 16 summer or winter Olympic Games. The first was Leopoldo Sainz de la Maza, part of the silver medal-winning polo team at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium.In all, Andalusians have won 6 gold medals, 11 silver, and 2 bronze. Winners of multiple medals include the Cordoban boxer Rafael Lozano (bronze in the 1996 Summer Olympics at Atlanta, Georgia, US, and silver in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia); sailor Theresa Zabell, Malague\u00f1a by adoption (gold medals at Barcelona in 1992 and Atlanta in 1996). Other notable winners have been Granadan tennis player Manuel Orantes (silver in the men's singles of the demonstration tournament in Mexico City in 1968), Jerezano riders Ignacio Rambla and Rafael Soto (silver in dressage in Athens in 2004) and the racewalker Paquillo Fern\u00e1ndez from Guadix (silver in Athens in 2004).\nThe largest number of Olympic appearances were by the Malague\u00f1a swimmer Mar\u00eda Pel\u00e1ez (five appearances), the Granadan skier Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Rienda (four), the Sevillian rider Luis Astolfi (four), and the Sevillian rower Fernando Climent (four, including a silver at Los Angeles, California, US, in 1984.Seville has been a pre-candidate to host the Summer Olympics in two occasions, 2004 and 2008, and Granada has been a pre-candidate to host the winter Olympics; neither has ever succeeded in its candidature. The ski resort of Sierra Nevada, near Granada, has however hosted the 1996 Alpine World Ski Championships, and Granada hosted the 2015 Winter Universiade.\n\n\n=== Other sports ===\nOther sporting events in Andalusia include surfing, kitesurfing and windsurfing competitions at Tarifa, various golf tournaments at courses along the coast, and horse racing and polo at several locations in the interior. Andalusia hosted the 1999 World Championships in Athletics (Seville), the 2005 Mediterranean Games (Almer\u00eda) and the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1996 (Granada), among other major events. There is also the annual Vuelta a Andaluc\u00eda bicycle road race and the Linares chess tournament.\n\n\n== Twinning and covenants ==\nAndalusia has had a sister region relationship with Buenos Aires (Argentina), since 2001; and with C\u00f3rdoba (Argentina). Also Andalusia has a collaboration agreement with Guerrero (Mexico).\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAndalusian people\nAndalusian nationalism\nList of Andalusians\nRoman B\u00e9tica Route\nWhite Towns of Andalusia\nAzulejo\nYeseria\nList of the oldest mosques\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site \u2013 Junta de Andalucia\nAndalucia Tourism Site\nAndalucia page at the guardian",

        "wiki": "Virgin Megastores is an international entertainment retailing chain, founded in early 1976 by (Sir) Richard Branson as a record shop on London's Oxford Street.\nIn 1979 the company opened their first Megastore at the end of Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road. The company expanded to hundreds of stores worldwide in the 1990s, but has lost a large number of stores in recent years, largely with the sale and eventual closing of the UK, US, Irish, Canadian, Australian, Italian, Spanish, French, Greek and Japanese stores. By 2015, current operations are exclusively in the Middle East and in North Africa, consisting of approximately 40 stores.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Branson's early business ventures ===\nRichard Branson and Nik Powell had initially run a small record shop called Virgin Records and Tapes on Notting Hill Gate, London, specialising particularly in \"krautrock\" imports, and offering bean bags and free vegetarian food for the benefit of customers listening to the music on offer. After making the shop into a success, they turned their business into a fully fledged record label, Virgin Records. The name Virgin, according to Branson (in his autobiography), arose from a colleague of his when they were brainstorming business ideas. She suggested Virgin, as they were all new to business, like \"virgins\". The first release on the label was the progressive rock album Tubular Bells by multi-instrumentalist Mike Oldfield in 1973.\n\n\n=== Virgin Megastores ===\nVirgin's first formal store opened on London's Oxford Street in January or February 1971 (exact date uncertain). In 1979 the company opened their first Megastore at the end of Oxford Street and Marble Arch. Virgin Megastores and Virgin Records operate as entirely separate entities, like many of the other Virgin companies. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s Virgin Megastores opened over 100 stores in the UK, and many others around the world, including expansion into Asia Pacific and North America, under the leadership of Ian Duffell - President & CEO of Virgin Entertainment Group until 1998. Simon Wright - Chief Executive of the Virgin Entertainment Group from 1999 to 2009 was instrumental in the growth of the stores in particular developing the stores in the Middle East before their eventual disposals under license detailed under Ownership.\n\n\n==== Ownership ====\n\nLike many of Branson's Virgin brands, Virgin Megastores is not wholly owned by the Virgin Group. During the early to mid-2000s Virgin Group decided to sell off most of its Virgin Megastores to various companies, including the Lagardere Group. By 2001 the Virgin Megastores worldwide were split between the Virgin Group and the Lagard\u00e8re Group. The Virgin Group kept the United Kingdom, Ireland, United States and Japan outlets while the Lagard\u00e8re Group obtained the shops in France and travel retail locations globally including Australia, China, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Greece, Italy, Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan.Virgin Megastores in the Middle East currently trades as V Star Multimedia LLC. Culture Convenience Club owns what was Virgin Megastores Japan, which have since been rebranded as Tsutaya. The Australian Virgin Megastores and Virgin at Myer concept stores were operated by Brazin Limited. (Sanity Entertainment after 2009) until all were closed in 2010; Brazin also ran local HMV outlets, in addition to their own Sanity brand. In December 2007 Butler Capital Partners announced their intention to mount a majority takeover of the French arm of Virgin from Lagard\u00e8re. This deal was finalised in February 2008.In 2007 the real estate company Related Companies and Vornado Realty Trust acquired Virgin Megastores North America. Related and Vornado were the landlords for the two most profitable stores in the United States and those stores were profitable because they had long-term leases in which rents were locked in at an extremely low rate. Both real estate companies wanted to break the leases and replace Virgin with new tenants that were willing to pay the then current higher rental rates that would make an entertainment retail business unprofitable.  They have since decided to close all the American stores.\n\n\n== Store experience ==\n\n\n=== Product range ===\n\nVirgin shops have a wide selection of CDs, games, books, DVDs, vinyl records, magazines, portable media players, accessories and additional products such as calendars, board games and Virgin branded items. Larger stores also stock electronic equipment and computer peripherals. Note that not all of these product categories are stocked by all Virgin shops, though the larger stores do generally stock the full product range.\nIn 2003, all US Stores increased their focus on multiple fashion categories spanning Pop culture, Street, Urban, Movie & TV to complement the music, DVD and video games offers. Virgin Mobile products can also be found in separately run Virgin Mobile Concessions within most Virgin Megastores. Some shops also house cafes or coffee shops run by external companies.\n\n\n== Technology ==\nIn 2005, Virgin Digital was launched to cater for those that bought their music digitally or wanted to rip and burn their current music collection. This is designed to add to the services provided by Virgin, rather than replace the Megastores. The download service faced some criticism from consumer groups due to its incompatibility with the popular iPod music player. The service has since been discontinued. Around the world there were other Virgin branded digital music retail websites, such as VirginMega.fr, France's number 2 music download website.\n\n\n== Operations ==\n\nLegend:\n\n]]\n\n\n=== Europe ===\n\n\n==== Austria ====\nIn 2003, the first and only Virgin Megastore in Vienna, Mariahilferstra\u00dfe, was sold and closed.\n\n\n==== France ====\n\nThere were 35 Virgin Megastores in France. Twelve additional stores in France were branded Furet du Nord, and about ten international stores were owned by the same company. The French Megastore business was launched in 1988 by Branson and Patrick Zelnick, CEO of music publisher Na\u00efve.\nLagard\u00e8re Group bought the chain in 2001. In December 2007 Butler Capital Partners announced their intention to mount a majority takeover of the French arm of Virgin from Lagard\u00e8re. This deal was finalised in February 2008. According to the Lagard\u00e8re 2007 report, 80% of the Virgin stores was to be sold by Lagard\u00e8re Services at a value of \u20ac76.4 million, and 20% would be kept. Prior to this sale 51% of VirginMega, France's number 2 music download website, was transferred to the Virgin Stores company (sold to Butler), and the remaining 49% was kept by Lagard\u00e8re Active.In July 2012, LS Travel Retail announced that they will phase out the Virgin Entertainment brand in France, commencing 2013, converting all remaining Virgin travel outlets into larger sized Fnac formats stocking the same range in addition to more product lines.In January 2013, Virgin Megastore France filed for bankruptcy. At that time there were 26 Megastores in France, employing 1,000 people, after two years of cutting over 200 staff and several shops. The company had taken steps to terminate the lease on its flagship Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es store in Paris after 25 years on the famous street. In June 2013 the company was finally liquidated and ceased operations after 25 years.\n\n\n==== Germany ====\nVirgin Megastore withdrew from the German market in 1994, amid complaints that the country's shop-closing law was too restrictive.The Virgin name is used by the Lagard\u00e8re Group to brand a small number of convenience stores within airports and railway stations. In September 2019 there were seven Virgin shops, of which four are in or adjacent to Frankfurt airport.\n\n\n==== Greece ====\nAs of June 2005 there were 15 Virgin Megastores in Greece, operated by Vivere Entertainment. As of 2015, no Virgin Megastores exist in the country.\n\n\n==== Hungary ====\nIn 1996, local merchandising group Fotex opened the first and only Hungarian Virgin Megastore (1000 m2) in the first \"western\" shopping mall, Duna Plaza, in Budapest. It was operated under a franchise until 2000. Between 2001 and 2006, Fotex operated the store as \"Hungaroton Gigastore\". The shop was closed in 2006 and no more Virgin Megastore shops were opened in Hungary.\n\n\n==== Italy ====\nIn February 2004 the Virgin Megastore, in Piazza Duomo Milan, closed. Currently this building is occupied by Mondadori retail store. Up to May 2004, of the 4 retail points in Italy, only the store of Bergamo survived for a few months.\n\n\n==== The Netherlands ====\nVirgin Megastores entered the Dutch market in the 1990s and operated four stores (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Maastricht). In 2000, it decided to exit the market. Three stores were sold to the Free Record Shop group, while the Maastricht branch was closed. Free Record Shop also acquired three Virgin Megastores in Belgium.\n\n\n==== Spain ====\nVirgin Retail Espa\u00f1a, S.L. opened its Barcelona store in November 1992, just after the Barcelona Olympics. This opening was followed by another Megastore in Seville (1993) however the opening of a flagship store in Madrid eluded the retailer, because at that time, cinemas and theatres in the Gran V\u00eda (Madrid's most popular commercial thoroughfare) could not easily be reassigned for commercial use. The Spanish company diversified by opening small outlets in busy Spanish and Portuguese airports. In 1994, Virgin Retail Espa\u00f1a reached an agreement with the department store chain Galer\u00edas Preciados and opened small concessions in their Madrid stores (Callao, Goya, Serrano, La Vaguada and Parquesur). Galer\u00edas Preciados ceased trading the following year and Virgin Retail Espa\u00f1a quickly re-organised its operations and opened medium-sized stores in ABC Serrano (Madrid), La Coru\u00f1a, Vigo, M\u00e1laga, Bilbao and Santander. Larger stores followed in Portugal (Lisbon and Oporto) but by 1997 the impact of digital technology had already hit their distribution model very hard. Music was by then being traded freely on the Internet but the major music labels did little to help support high street retailers. Inevitably, the Virgin Retail Group took the difficult strategic decision to close all of Virgin's high street stores in southern Europe. In July 1998 Virgin Megastores closed its southern European flagship store in Barcelona on the corner of Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia and Gran V\u00eda de les Corts Catalans. This building is currently occupied by Zara clothes store.\n\n\n==== UK / Ireland ====\n\nThe first Virgin Megastore opened in the United Kingdom in 1979 and between the 1980s and 1990s, the chain grew, including via its merger with Our Price whilst under the ownership of WH Smith. By the 1990s Virgin Megastores had become an international franchise as part of the Virgin Group.\nThe Virgin Group sought to sell its UK and Ireland stores during 2007, and on 17 September 2007, it was announced that the UK and Ireland arm of the Virgin Megastores brand was to break away from the Virgin Group. A management buy-out offer was accepted. Stores were rebranded as Zavvi.\nFollowing the collapse of Woolworths, which owned Zavvi's supplier Entertainment UK, Zavvi entered administration on 24 December 2008 as it had been unable to source stock from other suppliers under favourable terms. By February 2009 Zavvi had closed its stores, selling some to rival HMV, and a few to Simon Douglas and Les Whitfield's Head Entertainment.\n\n\n==== Turkey ====\nVirgin entered the Turkish market in March 2011 with a store located in the Demir\u00f6ren shopping centre on Istiklal Street near Taksim, Istanbul. The product mix of books, digital media and electronics failed to compete with better established chains and the store closed in autumn 2012.\n\n\n=== Arab world ===\nThe Azadea Group of Beirut, Lebanon has an exclusive license since 2001 to operate Virgin Megastores in many countries within the Middle East, except for countries which already have a franchise. Operating as Virgin Megastores Middle East, Azadea has stores in UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, and Jordan.\nMegastores of Lebanon S.A.L. has an exclusive franchise to operate Virgin Megastores in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia.\nBest Financi\u00e8re (Label Vie Carrefour) of Rabat has an exclusive license to operate Virgin Megastores within Morocco. Since 2010, Best has been opening a new store nearly every year.\nAntar Group of Damascus has an exclusive to operate Virgin Megastores in Syria since 2007. Since the Syrian Civil War has caused most normal economic activities to virtually cease in the country since 2011, all megastores in the country are currently closed and may not return until political stability returns.\n\n\n==== Lebanon ====\n\nVirgin's main store in Lebanon is located in the old Cinema Opera on Martyrs' Square, Beirut Central District; it opened on 3 July 2001. The four level store's inauguration was attended by Virgin's founder Sir Richard Branson. There are also smaller stores at ABC Mall Achrafieh, ABC Mall Dbayeh, ABC Mall Verdun, CityMall Dora, as well as in Beirut International Airport. New stores were opened in ABC Mall Dbayeh in November 2012 and ABC Mall Verdun in November 2017.\n\n\n==== Saudi Arabia ====\nFirst megastore in Riyadh opened in February 2015By December 2015, there were four Virgin Megastores in Saudi Arabia.\nThey were located on Tahliah Street in the Roshana Centre, Red Sea Mall and on in Jeddah domestic airport in Jeddah and there's one at Dhahran Mall Eastern Province\nIn November 2017, a fifth Saudi location was open at the Hayat Mall in Riyadh.\n\n\n==== Bahrain ====\nAs of September 2008, there is currently one Virgin Megastore in Bahrain. It is in the Bahrain City Centre.\n\n\n==== Egypt ====\nThe first Egyptian store was opened at the City Stars Mall in Cairo in October 2005. Six years later, a second location was opened at the Mall of Arabia in 6th of October City in December 2011. A third location was opened at the Festival City Mall in Cairo in June 2015.\nAnd the 4th and newest branch opened in Mall of Egypt on 27 September 2017.\n\n\n==== Kuwait ====\n\nThe first location in Kuwait opened in 2002. By May 2008, there were two Virgin Megastores in Kuwait, one at Marina Mall in Salmiya and the other at the airport. However, by late 2011 the airport branch was shut down, while the second branch shut down in March 2012.After a seven-year absence, Virgin Megastores returned to Kuwait in February 2020 by opening its first new store there at The Avenues Mall.\n\n\n==== Qatar ====\nVirgin Megastores currently has six stores in Qatar, with one being located in the Villaggio Mall (an Italian-themed mall), Doha which is the shopping centre's main anchor. In November 2008 they opened a smaller store in a shopping centre called Landmark. Other locations includes Mall of Qatar, Qatar Mall, Doha Festival City, Hamad International Airport (departure area) and a small kiosk at The Pearl.\n\n\n==== United Arab Emirates ====\n\nThe first Virgin Megastore in the United Arab Emirates in September 2001 at the Deira City Centre in Dubai, two months after the opening in Beirut. A few months later, the second store in the country was opened in Abu Dhabi in October 2001. A fourth store in UAE opened in Jumeirah in 2002.By October 2005, there were four stores in the UAE, with stores at the Deira City Center, at Burjuman and at Mercato Mall in Dubai and at the Abu Dhabi Mall in Abu Dhabi. A month later, Branson was present at the Virgin Megastores opening at the Mall of the Emirates in Dubai.Sometime between 2009 and 2010, the ownership for the Virgin Megastore franchise in the United Arab Emirates and the Middle East was transferred from Star Multimedia to Virgin Megastores Middle East, Azadea Group. By May 2010, stores were also added at the Mirdif City Centre and at the Jumeira Beach residence in Dubai to make a total of seven stores in the UAE.The eighth store in the UAE was opened in September 2011 at the Dubai Mall in Dubai. The Jumeirah Beach residence appeared to have been closed sometime before September 2012, bring the store count back down to seven.A second store in Abu Dhabi opened at the Al Wahda Mall in November 2012.As of November 2012, there were eight Virgin Megastores in the UAE six of which are located in Dubai.\nIn December 2014, a store was opened at the Yas Mall in Abu Dhabi. The thirteenth store in the UAE was opened at the Al Jimi Mall in Al Ain in July 2015.As well as being an all-rounded entertainment retailer, these Megastores also act as venues, with artist signings/appearances, performances and quiz nights and a newly launched boutique section offering everything from movie memorabilia to jewellery.This store is quite popular among locals and expats in the country, as this is the only store where they sell more music than most stores in the country, which also explains why the country has more branches than the other Gulf countries.\n\n\n==== Jordan ====\nThe first Virgin Megastore in Jordan opened in Amman at the City Mall in September 2007. A second location, also in Amman, was opened at the Taj Mall in October 2015.\n\n\n==== Morocco ====\nIn 2007, Best Financi\u00e8re (Label Vie Carrefour) of Rabat received a franchise from Lagard\u00e8re to operate Virgin Megastores in Morocco. The first store in Morocco opened at the Almazar mall in Marrakech in April 2010. A second store was opened in Rabat (Kit\u00e9a G\u00e9ant Mall) in December 2012 which was quickly followed weeks later by the openings of two additional stores in Casablanca (AnfaPlace Shopping Center) and Fez (Borj Fez Mall). A fifth store was opened in downtown Casablanca in September 2015. In August 2016, a sixth store was opened on the property of a Carrefour Store located in the Sidi Ma\u00e2rouf Neighbourhood next to the city of Casablanca.\n\n\n==== Syria ====\nIn 2007, Antar Group of Damascus was awarded a franchise by Lagard\u00e8re to operate Virgin Megastores in Syria. The Antar Group was in the process of opening a store in the Al Shahba Mall in Aleppo when the Syrian Civil War broke out in 2011. The business has since closed after the mall had been heavily damaged during the fighting.\n\n\n==== Oman ====\nThe first Virgin Megastore in Oman opened in Muscat in November 2015 at the Muscat City Centre.\n\n\n=== North America ===\n\n\n==== United States ====\n\nIn 1992, the Virgin Group and Blockbuster entered into a joint venture to set up the first Virgin Megastore on Sunset Strip in Los Angeles, which was closed in 2008. The US Megastore business was launched in 1992 by Richard Branson and Ian Duffell, CEO of Virgin Entertainment Group. At its peak, there were 23 Megastores in the U.S. which generated $310 million annually. The U.S. stores were purchased by Related Companies and Vornado Realty Trust in 2007 for the purpose of closing the stores and to break the long term long rental leases.\n\n\n===== Store closures =====\nUnder new ownership, eleven stores were gradually closed in 2007. On 2 March 2009, it was announced that all Virgin Megastores in the United States would close.The store at Arden Fair Mall in Sacramento, CA, closed in 2005 and was converted to an Urban Outfitters, while the Grapevine Mills location was closed at the end of 2008. Related Companies announced that the Virgin Megastore flagship store in Times Square would close by April 2009, with the space being replaced by Forever 21. On 25 February 2009, it was announced that the stores in San Francisco and Union Square (New York) would close in April and May, respectively, and the announcement of all stores closing followed soon thereafter.  On 12 May 2009, the Virgin Megastore at Downtown Disney at Walt Disney World closed permanently.  As of September 2012, the last remaining Virgin Books & Music outlet operated in Terminal 3 at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Both airport locations closed by the middle of 2013.  The JFK Airport location was closed by the time Terminal 3 was demolished and converted into a parking lot in 2013.\n\n\n===== In-stores =====\nMost locations included an in-store radio station, branded Virgin Radio. U.S. Virgin Radio was not a broadcast radio station, but a DJ operated hard-lines system which broadcast throughout the store, and the complex in which the store was located. At the Times Square location, DJ selections were heard on the retail floor, in the office areas, processing areas, and even out on the shop's Broadway sidewalk frontage.\nAll employees of the U.S. Virgin Megastores could be identified by their trademark red or black t-shirts which had the Virgin logo on the front and the word STAFF on the back, as well as required lanyards with their first name printed on them.\n\n\n===== Technology =====\nThe Virgin Megastore chain in the U.S. had a different GSA look-up system to other the international arms of the chain. This system was a private network that linked all North American stores, updating each shop's product inventory every 24 to 48 hours.  The GSA was reportedly accessible from the internet.\nAmerican Virgin Megastores implemented a near real-time data warehouse in 2004. The data warehouse named 'Crescendo' collects POS transactions, along with customer traffic counts and generates KPI reports in near real-time. The near real-time information helped the managers identify trends quicker and react accordingly. The U.S. stores shared their experience with the real-time warehouse and the UK stores also used similar process.\nVirgin Megastore (U.S.) had a Customer Loyalty Program named 'Virgin V.I.P.' The Program used a read/write 'GraphiCard'. Every time a member purchase is made, the Graphicard was swiped through the POS Graphicard Terminal. Members points were instantly updated on the face of the card.  The website shared the loyalty program with the U.S. stores.\n\n\n===== Website =====\nVirgin Megastores U.S. website is VirginMega.com. In 2002 this website became co-branded with Amazon.com, and was powered by Amazon. Later in 2002 VirginMega.co.jp, the Japanese equivalent, followed suit. In 2007 the website was again changed, when Virgin Megastores partnered with Baker & Taylor. On 31 May 2009 VirginMega.com ceased operating.\n\n\n==== Canada ====\nThe first and only Virgin Megastore in Canada opened in December 1996 at 750 Burrard Street, at the corner of Robson Street and Burrard Street in Vancouver, British Columbia. The 40,000-square-foot (3,700 m2), three-level store was located in Downtown Vancouver, the city's busiest and most prestigious retail destination. The building was previously home to the central branch of the Vancouver Public Library. The Virgin Megastore ceased its operations in Vancouver on 4 September 2005 when on 28 June 2005, HMV Canada announced it was planning to expand the store and rebrand the location into the HMV brand. The acquisition took effect immediately after the closure and on 5 September 2005, HMV was opened.  With the dominance of HMV in Canada, Virgin thus decided to exit the Canadian market entirely. This Vancouver HMV location would later close in 2012.There were also plans to build its second Canadian store at Metropolis (later Toronto Life Square, now 10 Dundas East) in Downtown Toronto, just south of the since-closed Sam the Record Man flagship store as well as HMV's existing Toronto flagship. However, the exit from Canada resulted in the cancellation of these plans.  An Adidas Performance store stands where Virgin would have.\n\n\n=== Oceania ===\n\n\n==== Australia ====\n\nThe first Australian Megastore was launched in 1988 by Richard Branson and Ian Duffell, CEO Virgin Megastores Asia-Pacific. Between 1988 and 1992 Megastores were opened in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. In 1992, the Virgin Group and Blockbuster Inc. entered into a joint venture. This lasted until Virgin sold their interest in the six stores to Blockbuster, who promptly rebranded them in 1993 to Blockbuster Music.In October 2001, Ian Duffell, Managing Director of Brazin Limited (owner of Australia's largest entertainment retailer, Sanity) reintroduced Virgin Megastores in the country via two related transactions with the Virgin Group, acquiring 77 troubled Our Price music stores in the UK for a symbolic \u00a32, and in turn gaining exclusive license rights in Australia for Virgin Entertainment, initially setting up the first Virgin Megastore on Chapel Street's, The Jam Factory in April 2002. Brazin also intended to use the Virgin brand to open 45 new Megastores in addition to converting 55 of its existing small-scale IN2 Music stores that had not already been rebranded as Sanity. Yet, the programme stalled as Brazin battled internal disruptions and struggled to separate the target-markets for Virgin and its chain of more than 200 Sanity stores (at the time). As a result, the company's entertainment division posted a $27 million loss in financial year, 2002\u201303, and by mid-2004, Brazin had only managed to open 12 Virgin Megastores.In September 2003, Brazin sold out of its 118-store Sanity UK (former Our Price and VShop outlets) store network to Primemist Limited. In July 2004, Brazin entered into an agreement with Coles Myer to open 62 Virgin concept stores within the Myer department store chain. Brazin agreed to buy all of Myer's remaining CD and DVD stock, recruit, train and pay their own staff, and work within Myer's systems and promotions. These concept stores were marketed separately to stand-alone Virgin Megastores (due to their more limited stock availability) and branded, Virgin at Myer. This solved Brazin's problem since 2002 by separating the Virgin and Sanity target markets by making Virgin more \"family orientated\" while leaving Sanity's \"street edge\" to continue. Exactly a year later, Brazin stated that after a rocky start (with staff recruitment issues and aligning products with the typical Myer customer), Virgin at Myer was up 45 per cent on comparative sales and was performing well.In December 2004, HDS Retail Asia Pacific opened Australia's first Virgin Books and Music travel outlet at Melbourne Airport. Since then, the company \u2013 now known as LS Travel Retail \u2013 opened another five Virgin outlets at other major capital city airports in addition to one railway outlet at Southern Cross station in Melbourne. Yet, by early 2012, all of these stores have been closed.By mid-2010, Sanity Entertainment (formally Brazin Limited) closed all Virgin Megastores. Also, in August of that year, all Virgin at Myer concept stores stopped operating under the Virgin brand due to Sanity Entertainment not renewing their contract with Myer Holdings (formally Coles Myer) and were either closed or converted back into a basic audio/visual department operated by Myer (in 2011, these non-branded audio/visual departments were later closed by Myer anyway). Sanity elected to exit the Virgin brand despite the licensing deal running until 2015.\nVirgin Entertainment's Australian peak was reached in 2006 with 24 Virgin Megastores, 62 Virgin at Myer outlets, and 2 Virgin Books and Music stores in operation. As of September 2012, Australia contains no more Virgin Entertainment outlets.\n\n\n=== Asia ===\n\n\n==== Japan ====\nIn 1990 Virgin Megastores Japan Limited was started as a 50/50 venture between Marui and the Virgin Entertainment Group. In September 1990, the first Japanese Virgin Megastore opened in Shinjuku. During the 1990s, more Megastores were opened all over Japan. On 19 September 2002, following its American counterpart, the VirginMega.co.jp website became powered by Amazon.co.jp. This website has since disappeared.\nIn 2005 Culture Convenience Club bought Virgin Megastore's operations (totalling 22 stores) in Japan from Marui Co. By November 2008 the number of Virgin Megastores in Japan had lessened to 15. Culture Convenience Club's licensing contract with Virgin Group for the use of the Virgin Megastore brand had expired, and there was no desire to renew it. As of November 2008 Culture Convenience Club's subsidiary company, Tsutaya Stores Holdings Co., is expected to acquire Virgin Megastores Japan Co. Virgin Megastores Japan are to be rebranded as Tsutaya by early 2009.\n\n\n==== China ====\nIn November 2007, HDS Retail Asia Pacific (now known as LS Travel Retail) opened China's first and only Virgin Books and Music travel outlet at Hongqiao International Airport in Shanghai. As of June 2012, it is still in operation.\n\n\n== Virgin Books and Music ==\nVirgin Books and Music is a Virgin-branded entertainment retail chain exclusive to airports and travel locations, operated by the Lagard\u00e8re Services division of the French conglomerate Lagard\u00e8re Group.  Such stores have a much smaller size than Virgin Megastores and currently operate in 10 countries: Canada, China, Germany, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Poland, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVirgin Megastores (International portal)\nVirgin Megastore (Gulf countries and Egypt)\nVirgin Megastore Lebanon\nVirgin Megastores Morocco\nVirgin Megastore Saudi Arabia",

Previously he was commander of the National Guard from 2010 to 2013. He was arrested on 4 November 2017 along with 10 other Saudi princes including Prince Al Waleed. He was stripped of his position as minister on the same day. He was released on 28 November 2017 after agreeing an \"acceptable settlement\" with authorities of more than $1 billion (\u00a3750m).\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nPrince Mutaib was born on 26 March 1952. However, there is another report, giving his birth year as 1953 or 12 October 1953. Concerning birth place the reports also vary in that some argue that he was born in Riyadh, but another one indicates that his birth place is al Ulya, a village in northern Saudi Arabia.Mutaib is one of 36 children and the third son of King Abdullah. His mother is Munira Al Otaishan.Mutaib bin Abdullah and his older brother Khalid attended the Taif-Barmana School in Lebanon and secondary school in Jeddah. Later, he graduated from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst as a lieutenant in 1974. He received a master's degree at King Khalid Military College.\n\n\n== Career ==\nPrince Mutaib served as head of the commission responsible for reviewing the curricula of military college built in 1982. One year later, in 1983, King Fahd promoted Captain Mutaib bin Abdullah to the rank of Colonel, and he was also appointed commander of the King Khalid Military City.In 1990, he began to serve as deputy head of the military under the chairmanship of the National Guard in addition to his post as the commander of the King Khalid military college and the National Guard military college. In 1995, he was promoted to the rank of the team captain. On 21 December 2000, Mutaib bin Abdullah was made deputy assistant chief of National Guard responsible for military affairs and was also promoted to the rank of general. In June 2009, King Abdullah appointed him as deputy commander of SANG responsible for executive affairs at the rank of minister.On 17 November 2010, Mutaib bin Abdullah became the commander of SANG, replacing King Abdullah. He conducted a major $3 billion reorganization of SANG to develop its firepower and artillery. Okaz reported in May 2012 that Prince Mutaib had some future plans to establish a body in SANG having female soldiers.His appointment was commonly considered to reflect the King Abdullah's emphasis that it was time to start giving the power to the next generation in a way that would reduce the risk of a power struggle within the family. His appointment was also regarded as a move to prepare him for assuming higher-level responsibility in the future. On 27 May 2013, Prince Mutaib was appointed minister of national guard, a post newly created.\n\n\n== Arrest ==\n\nOn 4 November 2017, Prince Mutaib was arrested and removed from his position as minister of the National Guard and replaced by Khalid bin Abdulaziz bin Mohammed bin Eyaf Almuqrin in the post. He was in Riyadh on that day and asked to meet with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.Prince Mutaib is accused of embezzlement, hiring ghost employees and awarding contracts to his own companies including a $10 billion deal for walkie talkies and bulletproof military gear worth billions of Saudi riyals. Prince Mutaib was released on 28 November 2017 after agreeing to pay authorities a sum, reported to be over $1 billion, or 6 billion Riyals,  about 1,6 billion USD. According to one source from inside the Saudi opposition, the price for Prince Mutaib's release was $10 billion.\n\n\n== Other positions ==\nPrince Mutaib was also appointed as a cabinet member with the rank of minister of state in November 2010. He was a member of the Military Service Council. He was vice president of the Supreme Committee of the National Festival for Heritage and Culture and the head of the technical committee of the Equestrian Club as well as a member of the board of directors of King Abdulaziz Public Library.\n\n\n== Business activities ==\nAt the beginning of the 2000s, Prince Mutaib was the local representative for the Ford Motor Corporation in Saudi Arabia. In 2010 he bought Hotel de Crillon in Paris for $354 million.\n\n\n== Influence ==\nIn 1997, Paul Michael Wihbey correctly predicted that Crown Prince Abdullah would make his son, Prince Mutaib, the commander of SANG and that Mutaib would modernize SANG's capabilities in regard to counter-insurgency, information collection and tactical field operations. He also regarded Mutaib as a knowledgeable and highly competent commanding officer with strong professional ties to the U.S. military. It was also emphasized that Prince Mutaib developed close relations with powerful regional political and military leaders, including King Hussein and Turkish Prime Minister Turgut Ozal.Prince Mutaib's influence seems to begin when he was a military officer in the Saudi Arabian National Guard (SANG) as a result of being the main advisor to his father, Abdullah, commander of the SANG. During his post in the SANG under King Abdullah's command, Prince Mutaib was reported to answer only to him. He is considered to be a competent member of House of Saud and enjoy a wide following in the large tribes of central Arabia.Mutaib bin Abdullah is reported to have some characteristics that make him one of the leading second generation princes: his low-profile political status; conservative personal approach and commitment to his father\u2019s doctrine in addition to his strong tribal bonds. However, he is also characterized as both an ambitious and a respectable person. After the death of Crown Prince Nayef on 16 June 2012, Prince Mutaib was regarded as one of the possible contenders for the crown.\n\n\n== Views ==\nSaudi university students organized demonstrations at King Khalid University in March 2012, complaining about negative conditions. Prince Mutaib considered these demonstrations as a threat against the security of the Kingdom. He told that reducing problems and meeting the students' demands were not more urgent than security and stability of the country. He further argued that as a result of recent events in the Arab countries, they should be alert to maintain the stability and security of Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMutaib bin Abdullah is married to Jawahir bint Abdallah bin Abdul Rahman. They have six children, three daughters and three sons: Seba, Nouf, Abdullah, Zeina, Saad and Khalid. His another wife is a daughter of Saleh Fustock whose sister was former wife of late King Abdullah.His son Abdullah participated in various horse showjumping events. More significantly, Prince Abdullah bin Mutaib had two Olympic appearances, one in 2012 London Olympics.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Sanssouci Park is a large park surrounding Sanssouci Palace in Potsdam, Germany. Following the terracing of the vineyard and the completion of the palace, the surroundings were included in the structure. A baroque flower garden with lawns, flower beds, hedges and trees was created. In the hedge quarter 3,000 fruit trees were planted. The greenhouses of the numerous nurseries contained oranges, melons, peaches and bananas. The goddesses Flora and Pomona, who decorate the entrance obelisk at the eastern park exit, were placed there to highlight the connection of a flower, fruit and vegetable garden.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nWith the expansion of the site after the creation of more buildings, a 2.5 km long straight main avenue was built. It began in the east at the 1748 obelisk and over the years was extended all the way to the New Palace, which marks its end in the west. In 1764 the picture gallery was constructed, followed by the New Chambers in 1774. They flank the palace and open the alley up to rondels with the fountains, surrounded by marble statues. From there paths lead in a star pattern between tall hedges to further parts of the gardens.\nIn his organisation of the park, Frederick continued what he had begun in Neuruppin and Rheinsberg. During his stay as Crown Prince in Neuruppin, where he was commander of a regiment from 1732 to 1735, he ordered that a flower, fruit and vegetable garden be laid out in the grounds of his abode. He already deviated here from the classical organisation of baroque gardens, which concerned themselves purely with the model represented by Versailles, by combining the beautiful and the useful. He also followed this principle in Rheinsberg. Apart from the transformation of the palace, which Frederick received as a present from his father Frederick William I in 1734, he ordered the establishment of fruit and vegetable garden areas enclosed by hedges. In addition the central avenue and a larger intersecting avenue did not lead directly to the palace, as was usual in French parks of the era, but took off from the south wing and at a right angle to the building.\nFrederick invested heavily in the fountain system of Sanssouci Park, as water features were a firm component of baroque gardens. But the Neptune Grotto, finished in 1757 in the eastern part of the park, was used just as little for its intended function as the fountain facilities. Atop the Ruinenberg, roughly six hundred metres away, was a water basin from which no water could arrive into the park and because of the \"fountaineers\"' lack of expertise the project failed.\nIt did not succeed until steam power was employed one hundred years later, and thus the purpose of the water reservoir was finally fulfilled. In October 1842 an 81.4 horsepower steam engine built by August Borsig started working and made the water jet of the Great Fountain below the vineyard terraces rise to a height of 38 metres. A pumping station on the Havelbucht was especially built for this machine. It was commissioned by Frederick William IV and built by Ludwig Persius between 1841 and 1843, in the then fashionable Moorish Revival architectural style to look like \"a Turkish Mosque with a minaret as a chimney\".Many years earlier, Frederick William III had acquired an area which bordered Sanssouci Park to the south and given it to his son Frederick William IV for Christmas in 1825. There Karl Friedrich Schinkel and Ludwig Persius built Charlottenhof Palace on the site of a former farm house and Peter Joseph Lenn\u00e9 was commissioned with the garden design. With the baroque flower and fruit and vegetable gardens from the Frederician era in mind, the garden architect converted the flat and partly swampy grounds into an open landscape park. Broad meadows created visual avenues between Charlottenhof, the Roman Baths and the New Palace with the Temple of Friendship developed from the time of Frederick the Great. Casually placed groups of bushes and trees and a moat that was broadened into a pond at its southeastern end beautify the large park. Lenn\u00e9 used the materials excavated to create the pond to construct a gentle hilly area landscape where the paths meet in the shape of stars at the high points.\n\n\n== Buildings in Sanssouci Park ==\nBuilt under Frederick the Great:\n\nSanssouci\nPicture Gallery\nNew Chambers\nNeptune Grotto\nChinese House\nNew Palace\nTemple of Friendship\nAntique Temple\nObelisk entrance and the ObeliskBuilt under Frederick William IV:\n\nRoman Baths\nChurch of Peace with the neighbouring group of buildingsIn the neighbouring area of Sanssouci:\n\nEnsemble of artistic ruins on the Ruinenberg\nBelvedere on the Klausberg\nDragon House\nOrangery Palace or the New Orangery on the Klausberg\nCharlottenhof Palace\nKaiserbahnhof at Potsdam Park Sanssouci railway station\n\n\n== Points of interest ==\nBotanischer Garten Potsdam, a botanical garden established in 1950\nGreen Gate, Potsdam, the main entrance to the park\nHistoric Mill of Sanssouci\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Sources ==\nPaul Sigel, Silke D\u00e4hmlow, Frank Seehausen und Lucas Elmenhorst, Architekturf\u00fchrer Potsdam - Architectural Guide, Dietrich Reimer Verlag, Berlin 2006, ISBN 3-496-01325-7.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSights of Potsdam\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Sanssouci at Wikimedia Commons\n\nImages from Park Sanssouci",

          "Must place to visit if you\u2019re in Potsdam. \nBeautiful castle Fritz created there ;)",
          "Definitely worth a visit. Pretty calm and empty (June 2020 after Corona)\nThe buildings and surroundings are truly remarkable. But I would definitely skip the tours in Sans Souci and in the new palais",
          "Just a wonderful place! Truly breathtaking buildings with the interesting history behind. I suggest spending 1-2 hours for entertaining walk. In my opinion the best season to come is spring. \nGuide is recommended.",
          "It is a very well maintained amazingly large park area and its free entry (only the park area, not the palace)....not very fancy, but a good place to be.",
          "No.1 tip, come here in Summer. I came both in summer and winter, and there is no comparison. During winter they board up the statues and bring most of the plants indoors to protect them so to see the park at it's fullest, come in \u2026",
          "Potsdam, in itself is a very beautiful and scenic city outside of Berlin but I beg to differ to the exaggerative bubble of beauty, magnificence and art wherein some have placed the Sanssouci palace/park. Sure, the grounds are expansive and \u2026",
          "Such a perfect place to get close to Old Fritz, Frederick the Great Of Prussia.  Few places have such extensive Georgeous rococo craftsmanship.  Beautiful gardens and views.  Beautiful walks.  A must see when in Berlin.",
          "This is a very good historical place. Peaceful and calm. Good for a photoshoot.",
          "Gardens are quite extensive and elaborate but would definitely recommend visiting in the warmer months. During winter most trees are dead and nearly all of the statues and water features are boxed up for protection while the fountains are \u2026",
          "Like the thousands of others have said, the entire grounds is a well preserved and peaceful place. \n\nGreat day escape from Berlin. Good for pictures, people watching, biking, a date, burying yourself in a book, or finding inspiration.",
          "Perfect place for a daly visit! Nice walking paths in the green!",
          "One of the most beautiful and amazing places you can find in Germany... The spirit of old Prussia...",
          "Schloss Sanssouci (German: Palace) is a German palace near Berlin, but its name is French, meaning \"Sanssouci\" is \"without worries\" or \"without concern\", and it is one of the most famous palaces in Germany built by King Friedrich the Great, \u2026",
          "Enormous park and 2 giant palacess. Be ready fora long strall",
          "Quite nice however be sure to visit it during a nice sunshine day in order to see it's magnificence. I visited it first when it was raining and it was a bit of a gloomy feel. The greenhouses are very nice",
          "The park and the palace are for sure very beautiful to visit over summer. However, when I visited the place in January there was a massive renovation going on and all the statues were covered all around the park. Even the garden was mostly in renovation so the atmosphere was not really nice. Such a shame.",
          "Pretty nice park\nIn winter not much vegetation. \nMost palaces are closed, but the main castle (Sanssouci) has incredible rooms.\nThe park was huge and it is good to be able to see all the building located here.",
          "A fantastic place to visit. Plenty to see just wandering around, though there are numerous tours that can be undertaken. \n\nVast and impressive, with beautiful views and lots to do.",
          "Wonderful gardens, and the gorgeous palace is just the right size (about 20 rooms) -- it's interesting and beautiful, but not overwhelming. The picture gallery nearby is not to be missed if you like art.",
          "Such a beautiful place and breathtaking view of garden !",
          "If you a visited of Berlin you should go to tour to Potsdam and walk around at Sanssouci -Park. It doesn't matter which season you choose it will give you a great pleasure to explore the park with his outstanding buildings and the lovely \u2026",

          "A very nice place to spend some quality time with family and friends!",
          "Beautiful gardens, I could have strolled them for days. The palace is incredibly beautiful on the outside but I didn't go inside.",
          "Visited the Sanssouci Park during a study abroad trip. Very beautiful! A great afternoon walking through the park.",
          "A lovely place for a Sunday walk!",
          "Come here very often and sill enjoy the beautiful gardens and the tranquility, however teenagers need to stop leaving there trash behind and polluting the place.",
          "Good, clean park, ideal for tourists and residents if one wishes to have a quieter day out. The plethora of palaces and other historical buildings are well reconstructed and give the whole thing a nice flair. My only point of criticism is that it's quite drab and depressing during the winter. All around a good experience though",
          "Would recommend to attend it at spring because it's most beautiful at this time of the year. This place is huge and breathtaking",
          "Beautiful Place, with a castle, windmill and a museum",

          "One of the most beautiful places I\u2019ve ever been. Highly recommend.",
          "Beautiful place all year round!! (although in winter the status are packed for protection and are not visible). Sweet spot for running, yoga or workouts and for picnic",
          "Loved the parkland and deep silliness of the baroque / roccoco bits. A lovely place to relax and not take life too seriously.",
          "Is a really beautiful park with many palaces. Is just huge, if you are going there I really recommend to be very well-rested and too much energy to walk around. Soooo worth it to visit",
          "Awesome place!! Regardless of if you like history or not you should visit this place if you are staying in Berlin. The park/gardens around it are astonishing! You can take a relaxing walk or visit one of several museums here.",
          "It's as must when visiting Potsdam. It's a very big garden, which is most enjoyable Summer and Spring. You can plan a long walk around it and finish at the museum.",
          "The park is huge and wonderful with so many walking and running paths and different palaces to see. There are maps along the property to keep you from getting lost. I wish I could go back in the summer because there are many statues that were covered in the winter.",
          "Wunderful Park with different palaces and architectural highlights. You can reach it via train from Berlin. Book guided tour through the Sanssouci Buildings in advance. Much nicer in Sumner and spring as many plants and statues are covered in winter.",
          "Really cool place, but you should go in summer.\nIn winter they have almost all the sculptures in wood boxes so they don't break.",
          "a wonderful to enjoy the silence ..beautiful buildings and sculptures ..great German history..",
          "Very beautiful park. Next time during the spring or the summer. \nOnly the main building could use a lick of paint. As the wood if the doors is quite old.",
          "Frederick the Great's garden of perambulating pleasure in Potsdam - a perfect place to stroll with a special friend.",
          "Nice place for a walk with friends or family. Some statues are covered with some protective cover during winter time.",
          "Beautiful views and outstanding structures of the palaces make the park one of the finest places to visit in Germany. In fact, in europe the whole park is regarded as one the most touristic places to visit. One needs at least one full day to cover up the whole park. Worth visiting.",
          "I will come back at spring time, because the statues were covered and it must be even nicer with flowers.",
          "Great place, it is huge",
          "Nice park that is greatly taken care of. It can be really busy but if you come early in the morning or after 6pm you can enjoy it even more without the crowds walking around. Can recommend it to everyone, it\u2019s impressive and just beautiful.",
          "Impressive palaces, extensive grounds. Avoiding busy periods is good advice as the original palace is quite small and could get very busy. New palace was not at all busy, although we were still required to do the 400 metre round trip to get a timed entry!",
          "Very relaxing and enjoyable. Perfect for long walks and taking photos of the beautiful and unique nature ( because of the tropical plants that grow there: pineapples, figs, lemons...)",
          "Simply amazing park and palace, with great view which is breathtaking. Strongly recommended to everyone who is visiting Potsdam. You should walk through the garden and the park and of course visit the palace. You should visit the palace and \u2026",
          "Beautiful park and even more beautiful palace located in potsdam, a 30 minute train trip from Berlin, do not miss it!",
          "Very magestic and beautiful",
          "Park  Sanssouci is the smorgasbord of parks, there is something there for everyone. The Park boasts of a Roman Baths, an 18th-century windmill, an 18th-century porcelain Chinese tea house,  several Temples, Greek mythological statues and \u2026",
          "This park, located near the Sanssouci castle, beautifully represents the Rococo style in which the castle is built.\nWith astonishing gardens and sculptures it\u2019s a perfect destination for an afternoon stroll.\nThe trees provide shade in the summer and protect you against rain and snow in the winter time.",
          "The park is so big a wonderful you could easily need 2 days to appreciate it.  You will feel transported back in time. The spectacular palace and it's private collection of 16 and 17th century art. Even if your not a big fan, the building \u2026",
          "Beautiful park. It really worth a visit.",
          "Excellent park and the most essential touristic site in Potsdam. This park is enough of a reason to take the train from Berlin, with so many adorable parts of the garden, beautiful palace, and interesting history entwined. I did not enter \u2026",
          "Beautiful and well kept park, very touristic because of a cluster of landmarks.",
          "Wonderful gardens and palace near Berlin, great relaxing walking in the middle of beautiful flowers, and fountains. Spend an entire day in the area as there are many palaces surrounded by lakes and beautiful parks and gardens. Be aware to book your visit to the palaces in advance, cause it's always crowded.",
          "This park is beautiful and well maintained. If you want to visit the palaces the price is 19\u20ac which is a little steep but even if you don't the park alone is worth a visit. Not 5 stars because this park is giant, and as far as I could tell, \u2026",
          "It is beautiful. Huge and beautiful park for strolling.  Give it a full day to explore",
          "Loved the visit to the palace. Easy to access from the railway station. Amazing views. It will be excellent to visit during the start of spring.having a water bottle is a must if its sunny as you have lots to walk and visit.",
          "Beautiful park with interesting buildings and history throughout. Food and bathroom options are limited so be prepared. We spent 3 hours walking around and didn't get to see everything.",
          "A fairytale Palace and well kept grounds. Totally amazing",
          "Very historic and well-preserved site. Very cool place",
          "A very, very big park. It was my fault visiting this place only for 2.5 hour. There were some place which I should skip. Maybe if there were another time, I will visit this place again.",
          "Nice, but let down,maintenance poor.",
          "Perfect the view there  breathtaking",
          "Huge park with many different castles and gardens. You can drive around but you don't get to see much. You need to get your walking shoes on and allow a few hours to explore. Walking paths are well marked. It's a pity you can't ride a bike or scooter around, it would make life easier.",
          "I went there in winter (december 2019) and it wasn't crowded. The park is very wide, in my country I'm not used to walk that far, so it was kind of a funny and interesting experience!",
          "Great and Huge, Huge park. Littered with different palaces from 18th century and a working wind mill. A great place for not only tourists but also for locals just to spend a pleasant evening surrounded by nature. Apparently that was the idea of Friedrich Wilhelm II when he had these made.",
          "It's good place to visit in berlin.",
          "Beautiful park and woodland, full of interesting palaces to visit. It is big, though, so go prepared with comfortable footwear and layered clothes / rain gear. There are toilets and cafes dotted around the park and these are generally good and decent value given the location.",
          "Amazing place\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udca9",
          "What an amazing place! Coming from the UK I was expecting something similar to Buckingham Palace, but, seriously this far exceeds this! There's alot of walking but so much to see among the grounds of this park.\n\nIt's around a 30 minute bus \u2026",
          "This is a beautiful park to visit in the heart of Potsdam, not far from Berlin itself. There are great paths to walk or bike down. Huge grassy fields to sit in or walk around. It is also full of history and various different palaces/sights. Beautiful in the sunshine, but well worth a visit in any weather!",
          "Gorgeous  and a must see. Make sure to spend  at least an hour visiting  the gorgeous  gardens!",
          "Beautiful place for a long walk (or bike ride). If you are planning to visit Potsdam you should definitely save few hours for the park alone.",
          "wonderfull",
          "Perfect at summer. A waste of time at winter... all statues are covered and green is not green...",
          "Love this place, very peaceful and beautiful. Fyi  also get to spy mandarin ducks!!! Believe or not  you might see them if you are lucky.",
          "If you visit belrin u must go there!!",
          "Despite the fact that the statues had been boxed up for the winter, the gardens were beautiful in the autumn sunshine. Well worth a visit.",
          "One of the best places to be. Spare min 2, 3 hours to visit all places in park. One of my favourite is Potsdam University.",
          "Beautiful, it's quite big so it will take some time to walk around.",
          "Amazing place with one critical disadvantage.\nIn fact, I really, really liked this place. This is just a huge park, with an incredibly large number of historical and beautiful places where you can sit and relax for example. And there are \u2026",
          "Less than 1h away from Berlin, it's completely worth taking a day to visit, especially in the spring, when everything is blooming.",
          "Beauty with history! A nice place to visit during the summer season. A small walking tour around the park make of course sense. There are enough possibilities to park around. The benches in front of the Palace are provided. Overall a well spend day!",
          "Every thing  place of interest was pure clean  and well organised. Hv been there a few years ago, will go visiting again. Its just marvelous and so fantastic for all. Even my little grandson, Ethan of fourteen months loved the pure non \u2026",
          "A spectacular and inspiring place. Definitely an iconic piece of German, Prussian and LGBT history (ask a tour guide about Frederick the Great - a tragic story of love, loss and triumph).",
          "This place amazing. It is like a fairy tale of castles and gardens.",
          "Lovely trip out of Berlin, I did by bike to pass through the park. If you stay in Berlin more than 3 days, that should be an interesting variation.",
          "It's a really beautiful city with lots of magnificent places to visit",
          "the park is like being in heaven",
          "A very nice park that is home to various beautiful historical palaces with wonderful gardens. It's a fantastic place that must bee seen when visiting Berlin. It's almost half an hour a way from Berlin alexandarplatz station. I recommend to \u2026",
          "Beautiful palace, it stands up for the nickname of German Versailles but I think that isnt complete true. \nThe gardens are big and beautiful! Be sure to visit the Chinese house, the new palace and the building behind it.",
          "Free entry. Nice space for taking a walk with your loved ones. Best in summers as the fountans work only in summers. Loved it.",
          "Beautiful park and perfect for a sunny day out. it's free entry, but you'll have to pay to enter the palaces. I'd recommend getting a general admission one if you plan on entering more than one palace/museum",
          "This place is huge. I wouldn't recommend you get there in hot days as you are mostly in the open and there are not enough shady places. Other than this, it's very easy to get there from Berlin.",
          "Beautiful spots, as if you are in another world! Do start you journey early, just for the this area alone. It is huge! Spectacular!",
          "Feels rushed. Perhaps visitor numbers should be limited. Tour options need clarification. Needs better maintenance.",
          "This is a magnificent park setting. The size of the various palaces and other buildings is overwhelming. A spectacular place to go for a long stroll, or picnic. A mini Versailles on the heart of Potsdam. A must visit for any tourist to this post of Germany.",
          "Visiting Sanssouci is like stepping into a fairytale. Gardens, palaces, winding trails, vine-covered arches, hidden sculpture collections, vineyards and orchards. It is truly an unbelievable experience. Bring water, snacks, wine, and wear comfy shoes - you could spend the entire day just walking and exploring.",
          "Beautiful parc, every garden is an artwork and the palaces are truly amazing.",
          "A HUGE park. Put your sneakers on, you wont survive well with sandals. Many beautiful palaces, statues and gardens. The Nordic garden was my favourite with all the smells of the conifers. \nEating and drinking there is really expensive. \u2026",
          "Very nice place with lots of walking around :)",
          "One of my favourite castles. It is so beautiful here.",
          "What a great place to visit.  Beautiful gardens.  Nice walking paths.  Very old and historical.  City bus pick up to the train station back to Berlin.",
          "A small trip back in time to witness the remnants of imperial grandiosity. I seriously recommend renting / bring a bicycle to be able to enjoy it :)",
          "It is very beautiful even in winter, in summer takes my breath away.",
          "Love this place. Enormous park stretching through the city as an live part of it. Great architecture to enjoy.",

          "An absolute must see!  Especially, if you are an artist or musician.  Bring plenty of sun protection and a picnic so you may enjoy the immense gardens.  This is a place you may want to spend the entire day.  BTW make sure you have coins on you for the toilets.",
          "Very overrated and run down in my opinion. For a popular tourist attraction it felt like it wasn't particularly well maintained, and the main gardens were not very impressive. \n\nI didn't explore the greater garden area, just the main terraces that the palace overlooks.",
          "Great place, lit if memories",
          "Pretty big and awesome park",
          "Really nice view, but you should go on summer. All sculptures boxed up for winter",
          "Walking around palaces and lush gardens must be done at least once in one's lifetime. This is a perfect spot to do so.",
          "This place is naturally beautiful. Artistic castle adds more beauty on it.",
          "Beautiful heritage of the 18-th century. Palaces and gardens with lots of art. Must see for whoever loves beauty - natural and handmade.",
          "I have never seen a place as beautiful. The park is awesome with several castles at different ends. One can easily get lost here and it would take quite a while to fully explore the park",
          "Take your time (and a picnic). There's plenty to see in this remarkable park. From the windmill to the tea house, the fountains and the 'new' orangerie.",
          "Beautiful, peaceful park and palace. That's how great kings of the past have lived.",
          "What s beautiful park! Love",
          "It's about 1 hour journey from Berlin, but it's worth it. The park is so massive and beautiful.\nYou can hear bird chirping, or have a picnic.\nReally nice to be in nature",
          "Lovely park. There are many many wonderfull sculptures and great walks in this large pars, not to mention the castles and the windmill. You will have to use some hours if you want to see just a bit of ot all. Great place.",
          "Loved visiting this historical landmark and beautiful gardens! Plan to spend a whole day here because it is HUGE. Lots to see in the form of fountains, castles, forrests and historical landmarks. Very cool!",
          "A very attractive park with several things to see. Well worth the trip.",
          "Very beautiful park with equally beautiful buildings! Higly recommend a day trip from Berlin to Sansoucci park. The park is maintained in the best possible manor. Lots of walking involved if you wish to see all of the historic buildings at \u2026",
          "The most beautiful place I visited in my Berlin trip! The Sanssouci Park is located in Potsdam, a city nearby. It's a must! 30 minutes by train from Berlin.",
          "Although not much to look at in winter, this is a lovely stroll I'm sure during warmer months",
          "Nice place even in the winter ...",
          "Very nice area. 4 hours walking to see all the attractions.",

          "The view of the palace, and Potsdam, from the gardens is wonderful, and the \"cascading\" terraces are visually delightful.",
          "A garden that aims to have it all statues ,vistas,fountains and at the end the virtually compulsory Egyptian obelisk-its a wonder that any were left in Egypt!",
          "Unfortunately we could not take as long as we would have wanted to walk around since we were limited by the tour time-frame.",
          "We were unfortunate to visit this on a wet afternoon but it still didn't disappoint. the place is huge and you would need to whole day to explore it properly. We also went inside the palace which was fascinating and the gardens are also stunning.",
          "There are a number of palaces and buildings scattered around the park, all available on the day ticket which was good value. The Park itself is free to enter and is beautiful and peaceful with long avenues set between trees. If you wish to take photos inside the palaces it is",
          "The garden is very well maintained and nicely manicured. It gives a relaxing view of the palace and is comparable to other palatial gardens in Europe such as Versailles and in Vienna. Nice place to take a walk and take in the sights.",
          "Others in our party toured the palace but I opted to stroll in the massive park which contains not just Sanssousi but also the Orangerie, Neues Palace, Chinese Tea House and acres of woodland and pasture that cried out for horsemen in period garb. Adjacent to the palace are",
          "Park Sanssouci is one of the main attractions in Potsdam and probably one of the reasons for a day trip from Berlin. The best starting point is from the \"Luisenplatz\" leading to the green gate. The park is full of beautiful fountains, palaces and sculptures. Frederic the",
          "The Park is beautiful and relatively natural, makes for a nice outing even without visiting the palaces. Take the bus from the train station.",
          "This park is fabulous and so enjoyable to walk through. Lots of history and of course several palaces. Stop to see the windmill, the Roman Baths and the Chinese Pavillion or just wander around the fountains. Super cool.",
          "Prussian King Frederick was the creator of this wonderful landscaped park surrounding Sanssousi Palace. Besides the wonderful Royal Palace other attractions are the Temple of Friendship and the amazing Chinese House. A guided tour is highly recommended.",
          "Take the time to get out of Berlin if you can and visit this place. The park and the Palaces are lovely and you can tailer your trip to the weather on how much time you want to spend inside and out. I had a sunny day so spent most of it walking around the grounds and looking at",
          "Being on a hill we had a great view over the former vineyard with its symmetrical yew trees. The Palace was behind us.",
          "Really lovely palace with beautiful gardens and parks. This was one of the many palaces we visited in Potsdam and it is really beautiful.",
          "Large landscaped park with long avenues, monuments, fountains and vistas \u2013 Sans Souci Palace itself is an understated single storey pavilion but has a majestic setting on a terraced hillside \u2013 Many an hour can be spent wandering around admiring the views and building",
          "My wife and I decided at the last moment to visit Potsdam for a day on our way to another destination. What a great decision! This park is beautiful and holds two spectacular palaces on each end. The walk through the park from one palace to the next is beautiful with many",
          "This is both a beautiful and fascinating park to walk through. Many people just come to visit the Sanssouci Palace, but there is a lot more to see. The walk from the \u2018New Palace\u2019 through the formal gardens, taking a short diversion to see the Orangery, and ending up at the",
          "Wow such a magnificent Palace. The grounds are awesome and the Palace is amazing. Such a lot to see and a great way to spend some time just strolling around",
          "This was the summer home of Frederick the Great,King of Prussia,and consists of parks and palaces on quite a grand scale. The orangerie is quite attractive, but for some reason I didn't found it particularly interesting, and the whole site was over commercialised.",
          "The most impressive part of the park are the plants at the stairs sides leading to the palace. On the flat part of the park leading to the New Palace, there are enough plants and statues to keep watching you for hours.The entrance is free of charge.",
          "A beautiful summercastle with nice gardens and park to stroll around in. There are also shops with nice items and places to eat.",
          "Has beautiful gardens and fountains. Nicely restored 9 rooms of Frederick the Great's summer home. Take the time to go all the way to the bottom of the hill to see all of the flower gardens.",
          "Easy to walk around and good clean athmosphere. Recommend it for a evening or day walk. About a 35 min walk from mercure hotel or 45-55 min from the railroad station",
          "Amazing place, beautiful buildings so well maintained, worth a few visits as the park covers such a large area.",
          "The park of Sanssouci is quite lovely, with several excellent walks. The terraced gardens up to the palace are particularly appealing. Make sure to look at the grave of Frederick the Great, and note the potatoes lying on it, recognition of his role in introducing the potato into",
          "Took my mother and boyfriend here. We loved it. All of this area is very beautiful! Don't miss it! <3",
          "Just 45 mins on the train from Berlin and a totally different pace of life. Pretty potsdam is worth the trip. Lots of tour companies offering trips to the park and palaces but I say keep it simple. Get the train yourself, hire a bike from the station, complete with lock and",
          "The palace where Roosevelt, DeGaulle, Churchill and Stalin determined the disposition of Western Europe after WWII is surrounded by a fantastic park with statues, water features and water fowl. This is something that seems to come out of a fairy tale book as it is so beautiful",
          "A very large area to cover. Could actually do with a Land Train or Buggy for the less well mobile, which I am sure would be appreciate. Be warned, you will need to pay to take pictures when you go into the New Palace which I did not realise, otherwise the room guards will pounce",
          "This place should be a destination by itself. The park is beautiful, large trees, ponds, ducks and swans. Incredible castles and smaller constructions. Dedicate a whole day to visit the park. Amazing!",
          "After visiting the palace (see review), we took some time to walk in this, amazing, splendid park! Stunning design! Everything was so green and well kept! We had a special day visiting Sanssouci. It\u2019s worth it even on a rainy day.",
          "This is a park full of ornate palaces. We have been twice (summer 2016 with our teenage children and this August on our own). On both occasions, we visited the Neues Palais. This time we finally went inside Schloss Sansoucci itself. Other highlights were the Picture Gallery",
          "Postdam Sanssouci park offers the visits of several historical sites from the times of the emperor Friedrich : Old castle, New castle, the Orangerie, the Historic Windmill. The luxury of these places gives you an idea of the extravagance of the Prussian empire. Also , old town",
          "A short visit here when in Potsdam. The gardens are amazing in layout with flowerbeds, fountains and statues adorning them. The large flight of steps leading up to the Sanssouci palace is stunning in itself. From here you can look at the views over the gardens and beyond. We",
          "Very big park! There is a lot of little corners to explore. Plan a couple of hours here if you don't want to feel rushed:)",
          "45 minutes from Berlin city centre but a real taste of the Prussian empire as was. Huge palaces, vast gardens, awe inspiring architecture and interiors. The park and palaces are still being restored but this is definitely a full day out from a Berlin city break.",
          "Sanssouci Park is located in Potsdam real close to Berlin. It is a must-see when visiting the Berlin area. Admission is free, but when entering a donation is requested. You can purchase a map of Sanssouci Park for 2 Euros. Be sure to wear some comfortable shoes as you will be",
          "Great park in the city of Potsdam and a short walk from the historical district where I was staying. Lots of statues and things to see beyond the palaces. I made two trips during my visit and got to cover a lot of it",
          "A park to see. Some renowation undergoing. Best seen by bike as it is really large. Not much service so take your own beverage.",
          "If I am near Berlin , I go here and I do not have a problem to spend here the whole day. The scenery is very romantic. It us ideal for sunday afternoon for a family trip or for a date. I like that every detail of this park is considered as very important and you do not see",
          "The gardens are pretty and the building is impressive. We didn't go inside so can't comment. I would not go out of my way to visit here.",
          "Great experiance. Must try. We spend whole day at the park and visited palaces. We finished our trip by having dinner at Kades Restaurant Am Pfingstberg.",
          "For anyone visiting Potsdam this is a must see though a good pair of legs is a help as in order to cover the whole park and it's gardens a fair amount of walking is involved,much of it up hill.",
          "Love it! Soooo beautiful. The city offers a lot of different kind of restaurants. And is a very comfy city for kids.",
          "Went for a stroll today on our way home from 3 days in Berlin. It was very nice and quiet after some very noisy days in Berlin. What a refuge! Plan for at least 3 hours for a quick browse. Also remember that there is a lot to see besides the park: Windmill, several castles,",
          "We came here as a day trip from Berlin. It was easy to get to (other reviews cover this in a lot of detail), but would recommend the all day ticket for zones AB&C (7.70\u20ac). We got on one of the Hop On, Hop Off buses from outside the train station (17\u20ac each) which gave a great",
          "This was grand and majestic in the layout. It took my breath away till I got closer. It was very poorly maintained compared to the Schonbrunn Palace outside Vienna. The hedges were not trimmed. The grass was not trimmed in all but a few places only. I was very disappointed.",
          "First of all a tip. We parked up in the official car park, as we were entering the park we thought it was a good idea to have a horse draw tour, esp as we were short on time and horses walk quicker than we can. However, the operator wouldn't leave until the carriage was full",
          "Fantastic walks with lovely park lands, interesting buildings and plenty of places to rest in between.",
          "Firstly, it should be said that the Sanssouci park complex consists of several palaces (two large and several small ones) that are located on a very, very large territory of the park. If you are going to visit all the palaces, it makes sense to take a combined ticket. It costs",
          "Huge gardens with various palaces and other buildings dotted around. Very well kept. Like many other places we visited the charge to use the toilets.",
          "Take all day to see it all, I felt rushed since things close around 5-6pm. Nice views and great to do if it is not too hot.",
          "As the Potsdam Parks as a whole a great place for a day in nature. Pack a picnic and take a stroll in the gardens",
          "We spent a couple of hours walking around the beautiful gardens and woods. The gardens are very well maintained and just walking down the terraces and seeing the palace behind is beautiful. The stories about friedrich the great are a mirror of the time. Walking through the woods",
          "The park is free to enter but obvious tourists may be asked for a voluntary donation towards its upkeep. Te park is vast and contains several palaces, churches, restaurants etc. You could happily spend a weekend just making the most of this venue.",
          "When visiting the Palace, take a walk down to the park. The statuary is interesting, and the views up the hill (toward the Palace) are interesting and striking. Take your camera!",
          "I personally think that this park is one of the best parks I've been to, many things to see and explore, felt like being in a different world while strolling through it and seeing the amazing sanssouci palace!",
          "The park is ideal for an afternoon stroll even though it is crowded with tourists. The gardens also offer quieter areas where you can just sit and enjoy nature at its finest. Look for the parts with fewer tourists and discover things for yourself.",
          "This park is HUGE, over a mile long. It is impossible to see everything in one day. Concentrate on seeing as many of the Palaces and buildings you can in one day (with a combination ticket on the Internet), then see the park for free the next day. See my review of Neues",
          "Sanssouci Park is very large with a cluster of buildings in one spot and then others are far flung. If your time is limited to an afternoon I would suggest to plan your visit around the Sanssouci Palace, the Bildergalerie, NeueKammern, and the Orangerie cluster. If your time is",
          "We went on to Potsdam with our guide, he took us there as it is a must-visit place. Glad we visited Germany history museum the day before, we learned quite something about Frederick the Great, and today we walked on his way. It is a gigantic French style garden, statues,",
          "A nice place for a walk, with a varierty of natural woodlands, ornamental gardens and grassland areas, formerly the hunting grounds of kings. Not worth a visit in itself unless you are a nature lover, but a very nice walk between the historic palaces none the less.",
          "Essentially we did not find the staff in the ticket office very helpful. There was one member of staff who spoke English but he was not particularly helpful. He replied to questions with short answers which did not really cover what we wanted to know and seemed impatient if we",
          "This is a fantastic complex which should not be missed. You can easily take the train from Berlin to get here. Arrive early in the morning as the lines can be long. You will be given entrance time for the new palace and the Sanssouci palace. Do not underestimate the distance",
          "A beautiful park containing 4 castles - on a grand scale. We arrived late and saw too little. You'd need a whole day to do this justice. Well worth the visit, and the park is free.",
          "Sanssouci is a vast landscape garden and an impressive specimen of Prussian grandeur. A must-see when in Berlin/Potsdam. Plan at least half a day to see the whole park, as it is very large.",
          "This is a must visit place. One got to peer into the mind of Frederick the Great, quite an exceptional person. Make sure that visit tickets are booked in advance. Long queues otherwise.",
          "This is well worth seeing, we did not have enough time, I would have liked a day there, there are 90 kms of waking paths and that can't be walked in a day, lucky locals.",

          "Visited this place on a Berlin trip, took train from Bahnhof Zoo. Rented bikes in Potsdam an could Get easily around. You find places to stop and eat and drink and bring a towel and bathing suits for a swim in Heiliger see, remember the most Germans swims as always naked :-)",
          "If you are going to Potsdam, then you should definitely visit Sanssouci park with its lovely royal palaces, gardens, fountains, forest, summer houses and baroque and neoclassical sculptures. Don't stop at Sanssouci Palace - continue your stroll and let yourself enjoy the",
          "Beautifully elegant gardens with spectacular views both in front and behind. Exciting and relaxing at the same time.",
          "Lovely surroundings, with people out walking with their pets or children. Perfect place to take a picnic",
          "Be sure to also include Charlottenhof Palace where the Potsdam Confernce was held after the 2nd World War, Neues palais at the far end of the park and the Orangery Palace, and much much more. It's a very large park so unelss you have transport prepare for a very long walk.",
          "It is a beautiful place to walk around. It is huge so plan to spend some time to go through the whole thing.",
          "After taking in the Barberini museum, walk through the pedestrian street of Potsdam to this remarkable example of park architecture. Free admission (voluntary donation which I saw nobody give).",
          "A calm park with magnificent views suitable a calm cool morning. Make sure to enjoy a cup of coffee and a prezel in the cozy coffee shops. Free entrance. Highly recommended.",
          "Visited the gardens after visiting the palace (which was all over in 40 minutes!). The gardens were as good as the palace was disappointing. If the weather is good, then you can be out in the gardens all day. Entry is free, and one can easily walk into Potsdam for a choice of",
          "Take your time to walk with no rush. Enjoy the movement inside-outside. Talk or just walk in a beautiful garden. Look for little treasures.",
          "So as not to be disappointed make sure you book your timed ticket as this palace has limited tours. Its small and you are time regulated going through which can be a drag but the audio guide is good",
          "Amazing garden, full of buildings and unexpected treasures one will come across even randomly. It reminded me a bit of Versailles. Unfortunately, I have to give 3 because of the total absence of signage.",
          "Lovely park to walk around in at a leisurely pace. It's a nice break from Berlin and easy to reach by public transport for only a few Euro. Well worth it in any weather.",
          "We visited and it was drizzling. It is a beautiful park. While I am glad that I went if you are short on time in Germany...this site can be skipped.",
          "After a visit to the Museum Barberini we went for a walk around the beautiful park for some fresh air, we only had an hour and a half before our train back to Berlin but we saw enough in that time to know we will be returning to Potsdam for more than a day visit some day.",
          "We came to this park as it we were told it is a beautiful property and indeed it was. Although it was early in the spring and things were just now starting to get more green I can imagine how beautiful it will be in the summertime. We did the audio tour of the Palace which was",
          "Fine symmetrical park with beautiful buildings. Obligatory to include in a biking tour round Potsdam, but your bikes must be parked outside the park.",
          "That is a very huge park. It took me over 2 hours to walk to New Palace and back. Nice views, quite a few palaces, fountains, statues. Photos attached. Perhaps the best way to explore this place is to take a bike..",
          "The Park Sanssouci is one of its kind. Spring is just at the corner, so very soon it will be a sunny flower garden. The Park is in a very good condition. For visitors. A fine location.",
          "So nice park with interesting places to see and visit. I can only imagine how beautiful everything is in spring when everything is in bloom. Bring your own food cause park is expensive. Worth of traveling from Berlin!",
          "I traveled to Potsdam to visit the palaces that were in Sanssouci Park but as it was a lovely day I decided to explore the park as well. The park itself is lovely and there are lot of interesting buildings and features to discover whilst you are there. The park would probably be",
          "I really enjoyed my first-ever walk throughout this park. It is the end of March and the flowers are beginning to bloom. It's very peaceful and beautiful. Highly recommend taking a stroll through the park!",
          "We visited both Sanssouci Park and Sanssouci Palace, Fredrick the Great's stunning summer residence. The palaces/buildings in Sanssouci Park are simply breathtaking - don't miss the New Chambers Palace, New Palace, orangery, Chinese House, and Charlottenhof Palace - all are",
          "Came here in winter and the views were fantastic, so wintery and frozen looking. The sun came out and everything looked even more dreamlike, such vistas. Come, walk around, enjoy!",
          "A February visit probably doesn't do the park justice. The trees are all bare and none of the floors are out. The grass and paths can be muddy. And, when I visited, only the Sanssouci Palace was open for visitors. I'll give the park the benefit of the doubt that it's probably a",
          "It is probably one of the best parks we have ever visited. It is amazing and it contains many palaces and architectural attractions. Definitely worth the visit. We visited it during the winter season but we plan to get back during summer to see it when nature is alive! The park",
          "My husband and I had the pleasure of touring the palace and its grounds with a private (palace) guide as part of a river cruise transfer excursion. Although we've enjoyed many palaces and gardens around the world, this one is well worth several hours.",
          "The garden is massive with many 1700s palaces located at the edges of the garden. We went in winter so it was expected not to have lots of greenery around. Yet, the corridors that are walled by naked trees provide the best atmosphere for solo walking and watching the world go",
          "We visited on a really cold January day with loads of snow on the ground. We had a wander for a couple of hours, seeing the outside of some of the beautiful buildings, but not going in. I would love to come back again in the summer as I think it would be spectacular with all",
          "This summer palace of the Prussian kings sits in a beautiful park setting. Up on a hill, overlooking the vast gardens is Sanssouci. It is a one story, long and narrow palace which isn't very big, there are only 10 principal rooms.. As with so many palaces that were later in",
          "We visited here in January...it was very cold and snowy. I thought it would look magical and be quiet. However I didn't know that they covered up all the statues with what look like wooden sentry boxes. It looked more like a military camp than royal gardens. However I think in",
          "One of the most beautiful castle's garden I've ever seen. The Sanssouci and New castle are really wonderful. I would say to spend a whole day at the surroundings of this park because each part of it is a new beautiful discover. If you don't have a whole day to spend there, think",
          "This place really had got a bit of everything. Palaces, churches, gardens, windmills, fountains and statues. Everything about it is truly stunning! Highly recommended, worth the hour travel from Berlin",
          "We were disappointed not to have more time to explore this park as it is totally stunning. Being winter it was dark early so my main tip would be to visit in spring/summer time. Despite the cold it was still possible to see how magnificent the park is. Absolutely worth a visit.",
          "The park is free to enter and with the exterior section of the Sanssouci Palace definitely woth the visit. If you are limited in time you may spare the hassle to buy tickets to enter the palace (12 euro for adult and timeslot must be pre-booked).",
          "We went to the park in Jun in a nice sunny day with friends. We must have walked for 2 hours, marveling its size and the scattered Roman architectures in the park. The Asian pavilion is a treasure to us, clearly one of its kind in the world. We did not get into the palace, its",
          "Beautiful place with amazing views, dont forget to take your camera ... full of history. it should be visited for sure.",
          "I don't want to give the impression that the park isn't beautiful, because it is. I can imagine that, during the warmer months, it would be an absolutely magnificent place to go. I was there in winter, though, and many of the palaces and other points of interest were closed,",
          "After the hurried tour of the Palace it was wonderful to wonder the grounds. The biggest disappointment was the lack of an accurate map. Several times we thought we had found another treasure only to learn it was not - very confusing. The teahouse was hard to find a huge",
          "We have been here before earlier in the year, in June, and now in July we had expected to experience this famous garden to be at its best in full blossom with roses everywhere. Unfortunately, there were none.",
          "In the winter, the fountain is switched off, the marble statues are covered up in wooden boxes to prevent frost damage and the flowers are all long gone; in the summer it is a mass of colour. The walks are still open however and you can still sit and look at the scenery but it",
          "In July with the sun shining, the flowers blooming, bees buzzing, birds singing, what a grand place to stroll trough or spend some time on a bench taking in the majesty of it all or soaking up the ambience on a blanket on the lawns. Quite magnificent.",
          "Meaning \"without cares\", this is a great place to get away from the crowds, Built as a local version of the French Palace of Versailles. Be sure to check out the grave of Fredrich the Great who wanted to be buried by candlelight, with no fanfare and companioned only by his",
          "There is a subway line from Berlim to Potsdam, then you can catch a bus to the park right in front of the station.",
          "Beautiful grand palace garden, the French-style terraced formal garden stretching majestically down below the Sans Souci palace. Lovely light on a clear winter's afternoon. Beautiful views of the palace, statues, fountains, etc, and quite a nice view of Potsdam from the palace",
          "We have been here numerous time through the years with our children as well as without. It is a lovely walk with a little woodland to explore within the park. Very romantic and good to visit all year round to see the different season. Sanssouci is not far from the tram stop so",
          "This park is kept to a very high standard. It is peaceful walking through the park and admiring the statues and palaces that are within the park, including the Chinese tea house. The park is accessible to disabled people although if walking it is a very long way from start to",

          "We took the train from Berlin using and ABC ticket for the day (17.80 Euro for up to 5 people). we got off at the Charlottenhof Bhf since that was the once closest to the Summer Palace. It was an easy walk but through a dirt path and we arrived at the bottom of the schloss. We",
          "Our visit to this palace and its extensive green and treed park was a refreshing departure from mainly visiting picuresque towns, villages and cities on our drive through Northern Germany. This location, southwest of the city of Berlin with its beautifully laid out terraced",
          "The garden next to Sanssouci is very impressive in its layout and design. When we were there in mid October, all the fountains were off and there was not much in the way of flowers. The park is large and teeming with sights and would have taken far more time than we allowed on a",
          "This park is a must- I think best time will be spring time you can sit down and relax and can get a good feeling",
          "Walking through this park gave one an understanding of the grandeur of the palace. The park is well kept up. The fountains, greenery and statues are all in great condition. Allow at least 30 minutes to check out this park on route to the palace. If you plan ahead and have",
          "This is a great park with a palace, German history has strong ties here and the general impression is very positive.",
          "After visiting the New palace, this park full of different shapes of fountains, step gardens, vineyards, flower patches, shaded pathways and a beautiful church used by the German royal family proved a pleasant retreat from the early September heat. It was specially cool next to",
          "Absolutely a must when visiting a palace - the view from the fountains towards it is great. It's large and you can take a stroll to the New Palace for example taking side paths and enjoying greenery and even some wildlife - we spotted gray heron in one of the canals. May get bit",
          "This park is like Tuileries in Paris and Petergof in Russia all together. Please give at least several hours to visit it and you will see not just nice palaces and fountain, but also the grave of Frederick the Great with potatoes on it, Picture gallery, church in florentine",
          "This place was a real surprise for me! Pleasant! Beautiful, green, full of history. So many flowers around.",
          "Very nice to walk Botanic garden is nice need 2 hours at least for short visit also a good place for sport activity",
          "We were lucky enough to have a friend who lives in Potsdam tour us around the lovely grounds. Even though the weather was not great, we totally enjoyed seeing the planning and thought that went into literally every square inch of this lovely park.",

          "This park, around the Sansoucci and Neues Palaces, is really beautiful. The landscaping is quite stunning, and harkens back to a bygone era. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "A very beautiful park spread over a large area and so much to see and do because of the palace in the park along with other buildings and lakes. Worth a visit",
          "This park is one of the most beautiful in Europe. Starting with the cascading vines from Sans Souci, and slowly walking down from the palace to the formal gardens and fountains is an incredible delight on a beautiful day, a memory you will not easily forget, the entire walk to",
          "We didn't come at peak time for the gardens, although they were in pretty good shape generally. We are very fit but it was still a heck of a lot of walking in a day (plus we went to the Sanssouci Palace and Neues Palace - are we there yet?) It is definitely worth seeing and if",
          "The best way to get here from Berlin is to take the train to Park Sanssouci station and then walk towards the Neues Palace. The journey from central Berlin takes about an hour. There is a reception and information centre as you enter the park from which you can purchase tickets.",
          "Hubby and I went to Sanssouci Park to go see two palaces. The park wa well maintained. It was beautiful. A must see and do in Berlin.",
          "Walking along the park and visiting the small palaces spread through the property is wonderful and really enjoyable.",
          "A beautiful gardens in absolutely stunning condition, this is well worth strolling through and exploring. It will be busy, but it is worth the effort. Picture perfect on a sunny day, you could spend a long time here walking or just enjoying the view.",
          "Beautiful place, well kept, not overwhelmingly busy with tourists, offers lots to see. More than one day is definitely needed to see everything properly.",
          "Several palaces to visit - at least six. The grounds are lovely. Give yourself at least three hours to walk around and enjoy the grounds. Well worth the half hour bahn ride to the area.",
          "We were here on our wedding anniversary and it was the perfect choice to enjoy a few hours in the sunshine, wandering around. Every view is stunning and there is so much to explore- I was really impressed that there was so charge to walk around such well-maintained grounds.",
          "Wonderful range of gardens, from formal walks with sculptures as focal points, to broad parkland with mature trees, to colourful flower displays around spectacular fountains.",
          "Ther Park itself is amazing. Get train to sanssouci Parc stop and walk the 0.6 km tpo the parc and walk from the Neues Place to Sanssouci. Between 8 and 9 on a sunny day it's cool and bliss - especially before all tourists arrive. You'll also arrive in time to get an early",
          "This park is visited by a lot people. But sadly the gardens \ud83c\udfe1 were not well done. The water where the fountain \u26f2 was dirty if not filthy. I was expecting something like English Garden in Munich. Nice place. With better care, the park would look even better. After all the",
          "Awesome place to walk around. The buildings look amazing, but I enjoyed the long paths surrounded with nature that lead to them even more. Check it out if you are ever in Berlin or elsewhere nearby, it's quite near the main train station in Potsdam. Have a good one!",
          "A garden where you can walk for hours. All kind of little buildings and palaces etcetera. It looks a bit like Versailles but smaller.",
          "The park and palace are just unbelievabley beautiful. You walk from the Sanssouci Pallace to the Orangery to the Belvadere to the Dragon Hoise to the New Pallace not knowing where to look next for the next feature.",
          "Without doubt the most amazing park I have ever visited. The number and quality of the monuments, places, and buildings within it are testimony to the grandeur of the design and wealth of rulers who created it. An absolute must see in Potsdam, and if in Berlin got to get out to",
          "The beautiful grounds of Sanssouci can be enjoyed for free and make for a delightful day side trip from Berlin. Since there are ample, well placed benches throughout, I would suggest grabbing some picnic fare before you leave Berlin (and, of course, a bottle of wine) to enjoy in",
          "Clearly no expense was spared. The garden is on a par with the finest in France and Europe. Walk around, climb to the top for a superb view. Sit on a bench and enjoy it",
          "An hour away from Berlin this park and palace are really worth a visit. The gardens are lovely, quiet and calming....and huge. Best is to take a (public) bus to the Park to leave some energy for walking through it and taking in all it's beauty. The town itself is really worth a",
          "What a lovely park to explore. We enjoyed a cool afternoon and evening walk around the Park. Most people were running, but we find there's always more to see when one is walking slowly, so there's that. There's a lot of grounds to explore and a lot beautiful castle-like",
          "Utilising a zone A, B C 6 day Berlin Card, and having 'done' everything we wanted during 2 weeks in Berlin, we decided to use the S-Bahn and spend a day at Potsdam. Well its quite some distance, taking nearly an hour on the two trains connection we needed from our base near",
          "Whar can you say that wasn t said before about this huge exquisite park mixing italian and french influences ? Both castles are worth the visit it is a very romantic site but they are renovating lots of places....",
          "If you had billions and wanted to find a place to relax you could do worse than follow Fredrick and build Sanssouci Park and Palace - the gardens and fountains are magnificent - the statues and buildings interesting - but to me it was the size and scope of things that blew me",
          "We got of the train at Potsdam and decided to walk around the sites rather than taking the bus. We got to Sanssouci Park mid-afternoon and it was absolutely stunning. My teenage boys didn't want to be \"dragged around inside\", but I didn't mind too much as the gardens are",
          "Incredible sights here, palaces, windmill and incredible parkland. Parking fairly expensive but well worth the convenience, take the horse and carriage ride, 8 euros for an adult, a lovely experience and a good way to see the many wonderful sights.",
          "Fascinating to see the grapes growing in the rock walls. So much innovation produced extraordinarily beautiful gardens.",
          "Wow, what a beautiful garden and park this is! Makes one wonder just how many servants it took to keep it looking nice. Great place to wander or ride a bike thru the many miles of pathways. Bring water and enjoy the peace and beauty. TIP: don't miss the burial sight of",
          "I went there with my boyfriend and it was amazing. A huge garden with a lot of beautiful old palaces. \ud83d\ude0a we went inside the Bildergallerie too and that was really nice!",
          "So beautiful. We visited on a very hot day and enjoyed every minute. Superb fountains and magnificent terraced gardens The park is enormous and though busy, was uncrowded. Clearly significant investment has been and is being made in the Palace and the park and in some parts,",
          "We went there on Monday. Their official site states that the perl of the park is closed on Mondays. Fortunately, it was not true. Probably due to the fact of a high touristic period - second part of July. Probably due to the fact that they are constantly renovating several",
          "This park is well worth a visit! Only a direct train trip from zoo station for instance. The park is huge and a nice variation from the busy streets of Berlin. Combine with a walk in Potsdam and you have a half day activity. Longer if you go in to buildings and museums. The park",
          "A beautiful and well-kept park. A must visit when nearby Potsdam! The flower beds are amazing. The Sanssouci castle is worth a visit too.",
          "We absolutely loved our visit to Sanssouci Park. The grounds are beautiful and wandering along the meandering paths is a great way to spend the day. During our visit, we also toured the Neues Palace and Sanssouci Palace, which we've reviewed separately. A lot of the tourists",
          "We only had time for a short stop on our way back to Frankfurt, so we entered the park and walked towards Schloss Sanssouci, which was built based on Versailles, complete with the gardens. We did not climb the steps up to the Palace but walked around in the gardens. So",
          "Big and nice place for walking with family and enjoy beautiful buildings. Nice buildings surrounded by flowers and ponds.",
          "It is definitely worth my travel from Berlin (i bought the train day ticket from Berlin (Alexanderplatz) to Potsdam it was around 7-8 euros, unlimited use for a day and including the return ticket). I got down at the Charlottenhof Bhf and walked through the quiet neighborhood",
          "We didn't visit the castles, but the park itself is great, lots to see. Nice palaces, Chinese house, forest areas, a great place to spend some time or a whole afternoon.",
          "Arrival. You can take S bahn from Berlin to center of Potsdam. Or you can exit on Wannsee station and take a bus to Glienicker bridge (that is the one where spies were exchanged during cold war). Once you cross a bridge you are entering a beautiful landscape of Potsdam. Take a",
          "Visiting the park and setting the castles is a must in Potsdam. We stayed with a horse carriage for am hope ans spend a couple of hours on the park. Great place.....we were surprised!",
          "The whole park is beautiful and easily walkable, but do go to the spectacular Chinese Tea Pavilion. It's bling, bling, bling, but a wonder and well worth a visit.",
          "The park and the historical places around the park were very impressive, and fascinated. Also the postdam city center is very cute with its street, cafees, restaurants, and shops. It must be seen.",
          "I had already visited the palace once before, so this time I wanted to focus on just walking through the gardens... Because doing both would take all day, at least for me. So I was looking at the location of the park in Potsdam, on Apple maps on my phone. You'll see that the",
          "Walking shoes required and not a sight for rainy day. It's a must see Potsdam adventure but don't pay to go take the bus and walk around you'll find more fav Potsdam attractions very close by! Give yourself a whole day and don't stay in one spot you'll be missing out if you",
          "You can just speak about this wonder in superlatives. Most probably it is one of the most beautiful garden of the world. It is the highlight of any Potsdam visit.",
          "Frederick the Great wasn't content with one castle, he had four in Sanssouci Park, and one is more beautiful than the next.",
          "We just had a nice stroll through the park, took some photos of Sanssouci Palace and Friedenskirche and enjoyed our time in a beautiful French style park. Flowers everywhere...just a lovely day. We would definitely go back (especially as we wer too tired to walk to Neues Palais).",
          "Will always remain one of the most beautiful parks filled with palaces in this world. Go see all of them you can find in this park as they are all very different in style.",
          "There are many beautiful gardens in the park, fountains, statures, palaces and ponds make this a very attractive park. Walking in the park, enjoy the beautiful plants and flowers, listen to the bird singing, enjoy a relaxing day.",
          "This is the crown jewel of Potsdam and not to be missed. Spend the day - or even two! - walking through the park trails and exploring the breathtakingly stunning castles and palaces that dot the property. We used a family pass that very economically got us into all the",
          "This was a lovely day out make sure you have comfortable footwear. as there is a lot of walking. It does get very busy even during the week. the best ticket to get is 19 euros and covers the whole site you do have to pay for a permit to take photos inside the palaces this costs",
          "Wonderful, aesthetically pleasing and well-maintained gardens linked to the Palace. A visit to Berlin would not be complete without a visit to charming Potsdam on the outskirts of the Capital.",
          "Really beautiful place to spend the whole day to walk around enjoying nature and garden design, fountains and many more! It is not just a flat garden, there are hills and meadows, water channels. In many places it is forbidden to drive bikes what is very comfortable and safer",
          "There is so much to see here - and the distances are far for walking, with places that do not allow cycling, so it takes time to see the many palaces that Frederick the Great built in his \"No Worries\" palace. I bought a book about Johann Sebastian Bach's visit to Sans Souci at",
          "We decided to do a day trip to Potsdam from Berlin. It was surprisingly easy and quick. Transportation to the park is direct and buses come often. Touring the gardens take a lot out of you if it is a warm day... Due to the sheer size. It is beautiful, vast and varied. There",
          "This park is filled with numerous attractions and would require at least a full day to visit and see all. The gardens are uniquely astonishing, well maintained and beautiful. The Sansoucci Palace tour is a must. The visits to the beautiful Neues Palace, the New Chambers,",
          "The Park of the Sans,souci Palace,take care there is no mistake ,this is the correct writing hides many surprising buildings,corners,lakes and fountains,every time a surprise,you never finish the terraces,walkways,plants",
          "The complex of palaces is breathtaking, as are the gardens and park. Like many such structures, there is a great deal of scaffolding and reconstruction work which detracts greatly from the visual experience.",
          "A wonderful way to spend a day - arrived about 9.30 and walked slowing to sans souci palace in time for 10am first visitors. Excellent audio guide and the palace is just the right size- not too large to be overwhelming and not too small to be in and out too fast. Followed up",
          "Too bad we visited this place during winter so the beautiful flowers were not in bloom. Didn't stop us from being amazed by the palaces though. We visited the baroque-style Neues Palais and the rococo-style Schloss Sanssouci, and we were stunned by both of them. The beautiful",
          "This is a window to the 18th century Germany (more than a century before its unification). The palace and the architecture are indicative of the socio economic conditions prevailing during the reign of Fredrick the Great..worth a visit !!",
          "The park is a wonderful place to relax between the visit. There are plenty of benches to sit and relax. I'd like to see more signs to go to the other palaces as some of them are well hidden.",
          "The park and palaces are not to be missed. Very well done from the 1740s to now. Sans Souci Palace is a great place to tour as well, as are the rest of the sites open to the public. Very relaxing, beautiful, and inviting.",
          "Great place to get away for a day from the city bustle. Only about 20-25 mins by train from Bahnhof Zoo. Recommend getting off at Park Sansoucci Station which is two on from Potsdam hbf. That way you can walk from one end of the park to the other and end up at the town centre.",
          "It's a beautiful park, with a lot of history. It's a must see when visiting Berlin and the area. We went for a tour inside the palace, which was spectacular with all the paintings, colors and decorations. It was not a long tour in the palace, easy to get in and out, well",
          "This was a lovely break from the city life of Berlin. The park was really beautiful and lots of people were there enjoying the sun and nature. It is free to be at the park and outside areas of the palace and very enjoyable to spend a couple of hours there.",
          "This a a big park with several historic buildings to visit, you could spend a lot of your day here easily",
          "There are several fountains and palaces in the park. It also have a small forest areas for those who seek shade in a hot day. We didn't know that the park is so big and decided to rent a bike when entered, but park's staff said that the park doesn't rent bikes and it's",
          "Lovely extensive parkland to stroll around on a sunny day. Free to access. Many paths linking the various palaces. Some pretty gardens located throughout too.",
          "Its a big park You need to walk whole day or 2 for cover the whole park, its awesome , so many locations to take good photographys, weather should be good, take some drinks with you as u might get tired of walking ;) the steps. its simply awesome",
          "Waiting for a clear to partly cloudy sky with pleasant temperatures, we left Berlin by rail for the Hauptbahnhof Potsdam. Cost for day pass covering the ABC zones was an economical Euro 7,60. An easy transfer onto a local bus just outside the station provided transportation to",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our time at Sanssouci Park - the weather was fabulous which helped, it is accessible for all ages and fitness levels.",
          "For the Sanssouci park you need more than 2 hours to see it all. Take your time and maybe discover the china pavilion from more than one angle.",
          "Stunning World Heritage Park and no wonder! Entry to the park is free although we were stopped by a young lady in period costume asking for a donation to help with the park's upkeep (which we did gladly) She gave us an informative map of the park - you really need it as the",
          "We visited the Sanssouci Park on a very sunny day, which you really need due to the amount of walking involved. From the two furthest locations (the Neues Palais to the Schloss Sanssouci) it is about a 30 minute walk. Whist the park itself is free, all of the other attractions",
          "As other people have mentioned. Its crucial to bring some good walking shoes as there is a lot of walking involved, if you want to see everything in the area. Your feet might be aching the next day, but it is well worth it! There's an abundance of palaces, statues and monuments",
          "Really huge gardens so be prepared to walk and walk unless you plan a little beforehand. We had a map which wasn't particularly detailed as far as the many paths were concerned, but gave us an indication of which areas we wanted to visit and that was a help as it reduced our",
          "Warning!! This is not to be attempted with heels..... the gardens are big and beautiful, the building are detailed and full of life. This is not a walk you should even try attempt in heels... strictly walking shoes or cycling is what I would recommend either way just enjoy",
          "I think it needs emphasizing that there's a ton of walking when visiting these palaces - specifically the gardens. It's all very stunning, but no piece of cake for the elderly or children - who can't be on their feet hiking around for hours. So stamina and good health are key",
          "I took a cycling day trip of Potsdam and we had a grand tour of the Sanssouci Park visiting the Sanssouci Palace and New Palace on our way. It is a huge park indeed and if you stroll, probably it would take hours on end. But it is still worth it if weather permits because it is",
          "Beautiful, relaxing! A very nice walk, worth the time. You can walk or rent a bike thorough the paths, around the buildings. If you do not feel like paying any extra entry fees to the buildings, it's fine, you can admire them from the outside. Also, gives a nice view of the",
          "A nice park in Potsdam, you can stroll through the park for a whole day and always find new things to discover. You find some very nice palaces in the park. Really enjoyed my walks in this park and because of the good weather it was even more relaxing. I would no recommend this",
          "An absolutely wonderful place for a morning job!! And it's open early and stays open late. I found the Chinese House and Ruinsberg particularly unusual. Ironically, the fake ruins were ruined by Allied bombing in 1945.",
          "A beautiful park behind the Sanssouci palace. Easy to reach by bus from Potsdam central station and free to enter. A big water fountain, many sculptures, flowers, and of course - view of the palace.",
          "Beautiful gardens and two stunning historic palaces. It was a pleasure to walk through the park on a sunny afternoon. Potsdam have so many historic sites and warrants a good couple of days. We ate at a nice little cafe in the Hollandishes Viertel - well worth seeing",
          "We had a perfect weather there was plenty of flowers , a relaxing place were you can spend quality time.",
          "We travelled out from central Berlin as we wanted to see Sans Souci Palace and the Neues Palace. There is a good bus service from Potsdam railway station to the Sans Souci Palace but be warned it is very very popular and you need to have a timed ticket. So we booked a late",
          "Really nice park near centre of Potsdam. You can walk whole day how it is big. Near castles it\u00b4s crowded, but there are parts of park which are empty. Lots of wonderful trees, especially giant Sycamore maple and Pine near Charlottenhof amazed us. Altough it is not allowed to",
          "Of course this is a major attraction and everybody visiting Potsdam is going there but still: the castels are beautiful and impressive and the gardens spectacular. More surprising is the park, or should we say the parks and forests?!, that form this huge domain. An ideal place",
          "potsam park right next to potsdam city is one of the biggest parks in germany. so much to see so much to visit .you need more than a day if you want to visit the neue palais and the sanccousi palace and you can have a lunch also in brewerie of the park.and a nice restaurant cafe.",
          "The first time we came to Potsdam was immediately after the fall of the Berlin Wall. My husband and I had a brand new baby then and were visiting family in Germany and at the spur of the moment drove to Berlin. I remember coming to the park and we were the only people around.",
          "Okay, maybe not quite Versailles, but a very nice park with great palaces and buildings. We took the sandeman tour from Berlin to Potsdam, and spend a few very nice hours here. Pity of the scaffolding on many of the buildings at the moment, but the history of the park and",
          "Beautiful park, probably more attractive a bit later in spring when is full of colorful plants and flowers. Now the fountains were empty but we didn't care. It was also very quiet so you could here only the birds which was great. There weren't many tourists in this period.",
          "Magnificent gardens if a little indulgent for one monarch. But he left a legacy for so many to enjoy",
          "We went on our last day in Berlin. It was raining! It's a 30-40min S-Bahn ride. Your ticket from the S-Bahn can be used on their tram/bus system once there. 10min bus ride, drops you off near the Dutch quarter. We walked around for a good 3 hours. We wished it had been a sunny",
          "Good for green-garden loving people right next to berlin. Historic buildings and nice walkways. Restaurants nearby.",
          "The castle along with the park is free for the visitors and has some splendid views. There are people wearing dresses from olden days enacting the daily life of the people of that era. The place is near Berlin. Take a train to Potsdam from Berlin and then a bus from Potsdam",
          "Unfortunately we have visited this park in winter, it was cold and windy and we haven't spent lot of time there. But even in winter its worth seeing. Amazing views and buildings.",
          "The park is easily to reach from the main parking. Entrance is free. Great views from the castle towards the city. Nice place for a short or longer walk with friends and family. Just be on time before all tourists are blocking your view.",
          "A visit in Potsdam is not complete if you haven't visited the Park Sanssouci with its amazing old buildings. If you want to see as much as possible, plan a visit for a whole day as there is plenty to see. I would rather recommend to split the visit into two days as it can be",
          "Sanssouci Park is the the best way to spend your time in Potsdam. Even if you don't pay to enter any of the castles, you will still have a great time in this beautiful park overlooking the facade of luxurious castles. Take the bus from the Potsdam Central Station and you'll be",
          "Great day away from Berlin. Lovely park, lovely stroll, great views. Easy to get to from Berlin if you fancy a change of pace",
          "On a nice and sunny day I visited the park when I was returning to the hotel. Beautiful historical park. If you're in Potsdam this is a must to see.",
          "This park has beautiful, relaxing gardens perfect to amble through. It does feel like they dont have an end. Go there with time to spare!",
          "Get there early enough to avoid some of the crowds. Especially if you want to visit the Sanssouci Palace as tickets run out fast during high tourist season. We missed getting tickets and I was very bummed out as I was looking forward to seeing it. But we still managed to put in",
          "Sansoucci park and all its endeavours each require their own review for which I do not have the time so I will endeavour to cover all bases adequately. We started with Sansoucci Palace - quite the masterpiece, very photogenic and a thing of beauty. It left my partner and I in",
          "Beautiful place with a lot of nice palaces. It is perfect for a long walk but make sure you wear comfortable shoes because is quite long and prefer to go ther during summer.",
          "We were tipped to go here by an American guy we spoke to in the Hard Rock Cafe Berlin. He suggested the park, and since it was nice weather when we were on holiday, we decided to head there. We took the train from Berlin Hbf, to Potsdam Hbf& then hopped on a tram to get nearer",
          "We really enjoyed walking in the park on a crisp day in January. Plenty to see, especially the windmill and palace in the distance.",
          "The Sanssouci Park is an amazing place to go, and a must visit if you ever travel to Berlin, I went in winter and all the plants where dry, but I could still feel the magic and the splendor of the past. You can easily go to all the buildings thanks to the inner bus that runs",
          "What a great time I had strolling though the gardens and relaxing from the pulsing Berin life. Do can visit different \"chateau\" but even more relaxing is the quit walk on hidden ways...",
          "Great architecture and landscaping! One of the best residence I ever seen. Will be back as soon I get Berlin.",
          "Defiantly a place worth visiting!! The gardens are absolutely beautiful!!! You could wonder around through them all day. The buildings are amazing and jaw dropping with the sheer size and beauty of them. A must add to any itinerary.",
          "Trees are bundled in wooden boxes to protect them. Fountain frozen over enjoyed by some ducks and swans. The rhododendron bushes are the only things providing any green space. Walked to New castle was a nice stroll. Saw l'Orangerie on way back to main Schloss. Schloss seems",
          "If staying in Berlin, this park alone makes the trip to Potsdam worthwhile on its own. Basically this is a number of palaces and gardens contained on one site. Throw in to this are unique follies dotted around the park like the windmill, Roman baths, gothic church ruins and a",
          "I can't even describe how much I love this park. I have visited it soooo many times!!! And I'm always overwhelmed! Every single time! Beautiful every time of the year, with sunshine or with snow.. :) Ideal for long walks! It's the perfect place to free your mind and admire the",
          "What a magical place! Well worth a visit. So big and full of so many beautiful sights :) The perfect place to stroll around and take a picnic lunch to sit in one of the lovely spots on the grounds.",
          "Sanssoui Park is a bit of a walk from Potsdam station (you can get there fairly quickly using the S-7 line from central Berlin) but there are buses from in front of the station which take you to the entrance. Even in winter first sight of Sanssouci Palace above the tiered steps",
          "A sunny cold day in December. This is my second visit to the park. Nothing impressive. Fountains are inactive. Large areas with nothing special. The chinese house looks poor. And the general feeling is that the park is neglected. German Versailles? German joke.",
          "I am surprised that no one mentioned the need to get tickets in advance or as soon as you get to Potsdam. We had a leisurely lunch on a Tuesday, however by the time we got to Sansoucci palace at 3:15 the tickets for the day were sold out, so we just walked around the grounds.",
          "This park offered amazing gardens with flowers, and of course the palaces with loads of history. In the middle near the castles or palaces there is a small restaurant with ice cream, salads, and drinks. It can be quite a walk even if you are in good shape in the hot summer",
          "If you need to get away from the city, this is the place to go. Beautiful landscapes and stunning architecture make visiting this castle a great experience. Even if you don't see the exhibitions - the gardens are more than enough. It's the perfect place to go to if you're on a",
          "For a Sunday or weekend break away from Berlin, just buy the C Area train ticket and go to Potsdam to visit Sans Souci, as well as the Sans Souci Palace. The Palace is not big though, but still we were mesmerized by the luxurious decoration and also by the boundless imagination",
          "Due to the winter season only the Sanssouci palace and Neues palace were open, but both are stunningly beautiful. In summer the park must be breathtaking. Both palaces required you to be on a tour this time of the year and palace Sanssouci was timed entry only, but it's well",
          "The Gardens of the Sanssouci palace have been turned into one of the finest parks anywhere in the world. If the weather is nice you should absolutely stroll through the park from the New Palace Sanssouci Palace.",

        "wiki": "The New Palace (German: Neues Palais) is a palace situated on the western side of the Sanssouci park in Potsdam, Germany. The building was begun in 1763, after the end of the Seven Years' War, under King Friedrich II (Frederick the Great) and was completed in 1769. It is considered to be the last great Prussian Baroque palace.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe building of the palace commenced at the end of the Seven Years' War, to celebrate Prussia\u2019s success. The war is also variably referred to as the Third Silesian War, owing to the dispute over Silesia. In an architectural form, Frederick the Great sought to demonstrate the power and glories of Prussia attributing it as fanfaronade, an excess of splendor in marble, stone and gilt.\nFor the King, the New Palace was not a principal residence, but a display for the reception of important royals and dignitaries. Of the over 200 rooms, four principal gathering rooms and a theater were available for royal functions, balls and state occasions. During his occasional stays at the palace, Frederick occupied a suite of rooms at the southern end of the building, composed of two antechambers, a study, a concert room, a dining salon and a bedroom, among others.\nAfter the death of Frederick the Great in 1786, the New Palace fell into disuse and was rarely occupied as a residence or entertainment venue. However, starting in 1859 it became the summer residence of the German Crown Prince, Frederick William, later German Emperor Frederick III. The palace was the preferred residence of Frederick and his empress, Victoria, throughout the 99 Days\u2019 Reign. During the short reign of Frederick III, the palace was renamed \"Friedrichskron Palace\" (Schloss Friedrichskron) and a moat was dug around the palace. The accession of Wilhelm II saw renovation and restoration within the palace being carried out with the installation of steam heating, bathrooms in state apartments and electrification of the chandeliers which Frederick the Great had collected from across Europe. Until 1918, it remained the preferred residence of Wilhelm II and the Empress Augusta.\nAfter the November Revolution and the abdication of Wilhelm II, the New Palace became a museum and remained such until the Second World War. Some of the palace\u2019s treasures were looted by Soviet Army at the end of the war. Much of its furniture had been removed and taken to the residence of the exiled Wilhelm II at Huis Doorn in the Netherlands. The majority of the furnishings were discovered by the Dutch in the 1970s, still in their original packing crates, and returned to Potsdam. Because of this, and because it escaped bombing in the Second World War, the palace today looks much as it did in 1918.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nWhile Frederician Rococo was established at Sanssouci, Frederick the Great had the New Palace built in varying forms of Baroque architecture and decoration, with some deviations. The King preferred Rococo and Baroque to the Neoclassical style that was already taking hold of Europe at the time as the preference of many monarchs. Architect Johann Gottfried B\u00fcring, with the aid of Heinrich Ludwig Manger (de), was assigned with the task of planning the New Palace and had already demonstrated success with the completion of the Chinese Teahouse and the Picture Gallery in the Sanssouci royal park.\nAfter disagreements over the design of the palace, in 1764 the design of the palace was totally vested in the architect Carl von Gontard. The three-story fa\u00e7ade had already begun to rise around unfinished interiors, as construction had steadily been underway. With 220 metre east and west fa\u00e7ades, the centre portion of the palace was crowned with an enormous dome, at the top of which were placed the Three Graces supporting the Prussian royal crown. The dome is not only architectural, it provides an attic area under the supporting timbers which carry it. Additionally, the north and south auxiliary wings are crowned with domes surmounted by gilded eagles. Between the pilasters, what appears to be brick is actually a painted effect, leaving only the King\u2019s south wing with exposed brick. Repointing the mortar of the joints proved to be an arduous and expensive task, therefore Frederick had the brick covered in stucco and painted in such a way that even tourists today are fooled by the deceptive finish. Over 400 sandstone statues and figures adorn the palace and auxiliary buildings, created by many notable sculptors, namely Johann Peter Benckert, Johann Matthias Gottlieb Heym\u00fcller, the brothers Johann David and Johann Lorenz R\u00e4ntz and others.\n\n\n== Interiors ==\nIn addition to the royal apartments, four grand staterooms (festival halls) occupy the central portion of the palace. On the ground floor is the Grotto Hall, attributed to Carl von Gontard, with walls encrusted with shells, stones, marble, quartz and semi-precious stones, which were enriched in the 19th century. Part of the design of the Groto Hall is a marble floor depicting marine animals and plants and an 1806 ceiling painting, Venus and Amor, the Three Graces and Putti. Attributed to Johann Gottfried Niedlich, the painting has replaced an earlier work. Niches around the room contain statuary and fountains, with cut crystal chandeliers hung in the arches.\nThe southern Marble Gallery, on the ground floor, leads to the apartments of the King. Decorated in white marble and red jasper, it is one of the most important examples of rococo decoration within the palace. Six windows are set opposite to mirrored niches, which reflect light throughout the room. Three large crystal chandeliers are suspended from a heavily gilt ceiling bearing three large paintings; Night, Morning and Midday by the artist Bernhard Rode. 18th-century chairs upholstered in leather, vases of faux Egyptian porphyry and console tables furnish the gallery.\nSituated directly over the Grotto Hall is the Marble Hall, the largest of the festival halls, which was used variously as a ballroom and as a banqueting hall. Rising over two floors, the hall overlooks the eastern parterres and the axial vista leading to Sanssouci. The richly gilt, curved ceiling rises into the attic area under the great copper dome. The painting in the center of this ceiling, The Induction of Ganymede in Olympus, was created in 1769 by Charles-Am\u00e9d\u00e9e-Philippe van Loo. With a surface of 240 square meters, it is the largest canvas ceiling painting north of the Alps.  Four enormous paintings commissioned before the Seven Years' War adorn the marble walls of the hall. Positioned at the pilasters are twelve statues, depicting eight Brandenburg Prince-electors and four famous \"emperors\": Julius Caesar, Constantine, Charlemagne and Rudolph II. A balcony with an intricate gilt iron railing overlooks the hall from the third floor.\nThe Upper Gallery within the palace is situated to the south of the Marble Hall and is directly above the Marble Gallery on the ground floor. The ceiling is painted in hues of rose, antique yellow and white, accented with heavy gilt ornamentation. The ever-popular Neoclassicism of Europe at the time can be seen in the roundels positioned above and on the doors. Six large Italian Baroque paintings hang opposite the windows of the gallery. All that remains of the original furnishings are three marble mosaic console tables and upholstered settees.\nAfter the revolution of 1918, which overthrew the monarchy, the Weimar Republic allowed 34 train wagons of furniture from the palace to be sent to the exiled Wilhelm II at Huis Doorn in the Netherlands. This is the reason why the furniture in the upper rooms formerly lived in by Wilhelm II and his consort Empress Augusta Viktoria comes from elsewhere.\n\n\n== Theatre ==\n\nOccupying two levels above the ground floor, the theatre dates to the Frederick the Great\u2019s reign in the 18th century and is still in use today. Rococo in style, the theatre makes heavy use of red and white with gilded accents. It can be seen as peculiar given its location within a palace, for the theatre lacks a royal box in which a king may view a performance. Instead, Frederick would sit among his guests in the third row of seating from the stage. The seat rows, which are curved, are reminiscent of an amphitheatre in antiquity. The theatre is fitted with modern stage equipment which is discreetly placed to preserve the Rococo d\u00e9cor.\n\n\n== Communs ==\n\nOpposite to the palace\u2019s westward-opening court of honour are the Communs, designed by Carl von Gontard and Jean Laurent Le Geay. Styled in the same manner as the palace itself, the two buildings housed the royal kitchens, utilities, gardeners\u2019 shops, palace guards and servants. Between the two buildings stretches a curved colonnade, decorated with statuary and obelisks, which acted as a state entrance and as a screen to shield the view of the marshlands beyond. In 1896, Wilhelm II had a tunnel constructed to allow passage between the palace and the Communs, avoiding possibly inclement weather. The curved staircases, domes, pilasters and columns do not show the practical purpose of the buildings. Today, the buildings are used by the University of Potsdam and are undergoing restoration although a lack of funding has pushed the date of completion to 2016. The 29-acre parcel has been closed off to the public and is no longer viewable by tourists.\n\n\n== Park ==\nThe New Palace, lying at the western end of the Sanssouci royal park, is located on a main axial avenue. At the time of its construction, the palace was located in an expansive baroque park area. Today, the area of the palace park within proximity to the New Palace is laid out simply with pathways, statuary, fountains and greenery. Nearby are the Temple of Friendship and the Antique Temple, which like the New Palace were designed by Carl von Gontard and built shortly after its completion.\n\n\n== World Heritage Site ==\nSince 1990, the New Palace has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin\". The palace is administered by the Stiftung Preu\u00dfische Schl\u00f6sser und G\u00e4rten Berlin-Brandenburg. \n\n\n== See also ==\nList of castles in Berlin and Brandenburg\nPalaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin\nList of Baroque residences\nList of sights of Potsdam\n\n\n== References ==\nHenriette Graf: Das Neue Palais K\u00f6nig Friedrichs des Gro\u00dfen.

          "Probably one of the best spots around Berlin, yes it belongs to Brandenburg, stunning and for free. What else?",
          "Beautiful and well kept building, the area is very touristic because of a cluster of landmarks.",
          "It's a place which belongs to king Friedrick of Persia. It's an office, bedroom, leisure place for him. Nice sculptures. Marble pillars and picturesque garden with fountain. Overall good place to see and purchase some shot glass of Potsdam.",
          "A phenomenal site with incredible architecture and neoclassical sculpture. One of the greatest things that I have ever seen",
          "It's okay, expensive for the experience you get. We had to hold some old Audio guides up to our ears for the 40minute tour - would be better with an actual guide, especially give the entrance fee (14euros). You only get to go into 12 rooms, \u2026",
          "Only walking around the grounds we were able to see lovely buildings, fountains and statues! Glorious gardens! Spent lots of time and didn't need to spend any money. Option to pay and go inside but we didn't feel the need.",

          "A Picturesque place with fresh air and a gorgeous park hiding the roofs of marvelous castles!A must see place!",

          "A truly one of a kind place. Your self guided tour will allow you enough time to soak it all in. But the palace is just the beginning of what will be a day filled with jaw dropping sites.  Wow.",
          "Great walking tour to Potsdam.",
          "Such a nice park build in a French style",
          "Beautiful grounds and an old working windmill, really nice for a walk. Sanssouci only shows the \"show\" rooms though, so there's no real personality  to it. Would be nice to have more details.",
          "The majesty  and history of Sanssouci is evident everywhere. The parkland leads from one highlight to another with plenty of space amongst the visitors for peace and reflection .And to see art on such a scale is breathtaking.",

          "Great place with a rich detail in history.",
          "Not very big but quite impressive. Good audio tour. You are allocated an entry time but unless it's peak season you should get one within an hour. It's worth buying a ticket for all palaces and other buildings around, it's just a bit more expensive, but then be prepared for a lot of walking. Recommended.",
          "Beautiful palace. Haven't had a chance to get inside, but the park and gardens are excellent. Late summer night walks are a must",

          "Just great\ud83d\ude00",
          "Interesting but don't expect Hampton Court Palace. \n\nEntrance is timed and you will be given an audio guide to walk through the palace with about 50 other people at the same time. \n\nRooms are beautiful and well restored.",
          "It is worth visiting just to see the famous Caravaggio painting that is part of the painting museum. Yes the famous \"The Incredulity of Saint Thomas\" can be found here. It seems that almost no one knows that, since there is no queue in \u2026",
          "A must visit for those who are interested in German city. It is a rather small palace by European standards but it is by no means unworthy of attention. Also remember to take the tram to Luisenplatz and approach the palace from the Sanssouci park as the architects intended. The view will be worth it!",
          "Place to visit in autumn\u2019s very nice",

Lots of background details on the audio guide...try to be near the front of the tour to give enough time to hear the whole commentary for each room. Ensure you have sufficient time for the extensive grounds and spectacular vineyards. Fabulous.",
          "Small summer palace of Frederick le grand. Inspired by French arts and style. Frederick himself spoke French better than German. The palace has a nice little garden, little if compared to le chateau de Versailles. In one of the photos I posted, we can see the chair where Frederick actually died sitting.",
          "This palace is another must in Potsdam. Sanssouci was the summer palace of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia. Although it is a small palace, it has a beautiful architecture with a beautiful view of the gardens and fountain. The best \u2026",

But even if you just have a look around the outside and stroll through the park its nice enough. So it's definitely worth a visit even if you wanna save the entrance fee and just have a look around.",
          "Cool.",
          "A beautiful historical place. Beautiful garden and castle. It's worth a visit.",
          "Must go.  Orangerie and interiors  worth the visit.  Then stroll through the beautiful park",
          "Beautiful palace and garden! Make sure you book the palace ticket early, either online (combined with other attractions only) or at the entrance itself starting at 10am. \n\nWe arrived at 9am and had a walk around the garden before going to \u2026",
          "Beautiful palace in a beautiful side of the beautiful city of Potsdam.",
          "Absolutely wonderful",
          "Beautiful Palace and grounds. Loved it",
          "It's a palace with beautiful gardens.",
          "It is worth the money to have a tour done at the palace. Each room was gorgeous and well taken care of. Highly recommend this as more than just a day trip outside of Berlin because the park is huge",
          "Awesome place. Good for walk and also for bike riding. There are a lot of places in a park what nice to visit, so, you have to have at least 2 hours for visiting this place. You can use X15 bus from/to Potsdam Hauptbahnfof.",
          "Beautiful place, all palaces are so huge and beautiful! I love Sanssouci!",
          "Wonderful day \u2763\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
          "Historic place not far from Berlin...suggested for one day trip",
          "Very beautiful and amazing palace",
          "Incredibly beautiful",
          "To see the kitchen and the wine cellar was most interesting.",
          "Beautiful park but you must arrive early to see everything, otherwise you can just get tickets for individual palaces. Buildings could stay open a bit later given the size of the site, also lockers are not provided for tours of the main palace which made the visit a lot less enjoyable. Staff not particularly friendly.",
          "It is small comparing to new palace but it has its charm and is beautiful inside.",
          "Potsdam is cool and calm. Less crowded compared to Berlin center. Palace is amazing from outside. Take a bicycle ride there, who will take you around the town to show the beauty of the place",
          "It's a beautiful  place to see",
          "Appalling maintenance, run down, a disgrace to the builders",
          "We spent the day in Potsdam and loved Sanssouci and the Neues palace. We bought the combo ticket at Neues where there was no line and received a time 2 hours later for Sanssouci.",
          "Very nice and beautiful palace. Berlin ABC pass works to reach here. I always feel like to come here and spend some time here.",
          "Sanssouci was the summer palace of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, in Potsdam, near Berlin. It is often counted among the German rivals of Versailles. While Sanssouci is in the more intimate Rococo style and is far smaller than its \u2026",
          "The Sanssouci Palace and garden was beautiful, nice place to relax and walk",
          "We drove over on a lovely July day to check out this place and have a picnic.\nLots of beautiful gardens and buildings \nWe parked in a small lot a few blocks from o ne of the entrances. We did not take the tour.\nCould use a few more restrooms, and more places to sit. We enjoyed our picnic on the lawn in the shade.",
          "Ticket including audio guide 12\u20ac, just for 40 minutes, which means that you cannot take your time, I believe it's overpriced. If you wish to take photographs you need to pay extra 3\u20ac to buy a 'permission'.",
          "Amazing, need all day for the tours",
          "Beautiful park and well maintained! \nWould highly recommend spending 3/4 hours walking around and absorbing the beautiful nature!!!",
          "Didn't go inside the palace but the entire vicinity was breathtaking, especially the Sansoucci Park & Neus Palais.",
          "Really good place",
          "Beautiful grounds, but didn't see inside, so cannot comment. The front is beautiful for photos though. Not sure I'd say it's worth a trip on its own, but Potsdam as a whole is nice to walk around in and the Schloss Sanssouci can be one of a few good stops.",
          "This place is very nice with its garden and the statues but if you want to see the whole castles in the complex, you need a full day trip and have to pay a lot. We only visited two buildings from the outside but even that was pretty cool. Recommended but not highly due to the prices.",
          "Disappointed as the theme here is making money. All buildings are a separate cost and you can only view during certain times. An average walk through the park, but even as we entered we were asked to contribute to the park costs. Never \u2026",
          "Absolutely worth the trip to Potsdam from Berlin. Enchanting!",
          "Sensational architecture and great place to visit",
          "For this was one of the most historical places in the world. I loved it.",
          "Beautiful English gardens!",
          "This Castle is exquisitely beautiful. There is always something to look at it at Every Corner. My favourite part was the Chinese tea house.",
          "I come here during rainy winter but the tour is still enjoyable. A beautiful rococo palace.",
          "Amazing place@ gardens",
          "Paris has Versailles, Berlin has Potsdam. Sanssouci palace is one of many areas of interest in this large park. The palace itself is outdone by the terraced garden and park beyond, so prepare for some walking around. It's quite amazing \u2026",
          "Drizzle and rain at the end of a four day trip with students. Probably not the best moment to visit, but since it's a park with a Palace it all gets lots of stars.",
          "The sites one sees walking and touring one palace to the next and the well maintained gardens makes it worth ones effort to spend a day or two here. Definitely wear comfortable shoes.",
          "Superb location and lovely place to spend a day out. The photo permit is a bit over the top but worth it. Definitely walk about in the garden and have a look at the other buildings in the larger park!",
          "I went to Potsdam from Berlin on weekend to explore. It's a nice weekend gateway. Only 30 mins from Berlin Hauptbahnhof. \n\nBe sure to buy ABC region ticket, or an extension if you have monthly pass.",
          "Beautiful place on a beautiful city. Well deserved UNESCO visiting place. Shame the late arrival of the rainy season got most of the plants half dry and they had to put portable sprinklers all around.",
          "Very nice view there, a huge garden to walk and a many things to view and take great photos.\nNo entry fee for the big garden just go in and have a great walk with your friends.",
          "The wind mill is a thing. You should drop by if possible. It's a working one for production evenly.",
          "Nice to visit, great gardens",
          "Very well preserved castle. On Monday the castle is closed.",
          "Sanssouci was the summer palace of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, in Potsdam, near Berlin. It is often counted among the German rivals of Versailles. While Sanssouci is in the more intimate Rococo style and is far smaller than its \u2026",
          "A must. Lovely in the summer. Very green an peaceful.",
          "Love this place",
          "Beautiful site to see. Bicycle was very convenient to go from the station to the palace, because the garden of the palace was pretty far from the Central station by walk and each building of the place also locates far. I rented one in front of the station by 11 Euro.",
          "Nice place for spending time with friends and family. Though the palace entrance fee seems quite high (\u20ac18)!",
          "Interesting but not that big",
          "It is a very attractive place to visit. It is better to go there before winter time. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",

          "Cool place but to visit in spring not winter. They have all the statues covered with boxes",
          "This place is so big and wonderful. You can enjoy in the park for the whole day.",
          "Lovely grounds and architecture. Most of the attractions are closed in the winter. The Sans Souci main palace was open for tours and the audio tour took about 40 minutes.",
          "Very high entrance fee to get inside the palace. Was a little underwhelming.\nThe park is very nice though and you can get inside for free!",
          "Very short tour of the palace as you are only shown a few rooms, but some of the rooms are exquisite and I've enjoyed it. They do adhere to the ticket times so be punctual. You also have to pay an extra \u20ac3 for photo-taking, which is a \u2026",
          "Unfortunately when we came here to visit the castle it was already closed, its due time to all the visits are around at 15:30 so if you want to visit come here in the morning.\nThis is around 1 hour away from Berlin so check online for \u2026",
          "There is something for everyone here. A great park.",
          "It's OK. Nothing special in the Palace. But the garden its really wonderful.",
          "Near by Berlin, easy transportation, wonderful gardens and architectures. Reminds long history",
          "Very nice park.",
          "It's a wonderful place \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Looked like a golden palace and couldn't wait to get inside. The rooms are unbelievable in their opulence and grandeur especially the Marble Hall and lastly the Voltaire Room which has birds and flower carvings over the walls and ceilings. If you are visiting Berlin Potsdam and Sanssouci is a real must 'MUST SEE'.",
          "Amazing castles and park to walk around. Just keep in mind that in winter they cover up the statues! So if thats what you are going for, go in summer.",
          "Beatiful place, close Berlin. It is also quite big and it also has a story bind to it. But with a big group you easily get lost. Overall, nice place.",
          "The place is very nice. Get ready to walk around and discover little spots around the park. Definitely check out the Sanssoucci Palace, fantastically pretty and stories in the audio tour.",
          "Overpriced entrance fee. 45 minutes in groups... Not enough time to hear the audio guide. We expected the big gallery with all famous paintings... Which was not the case.  12 euro is to much for such a small palace!",
          "Well displayed treatment of Epic home and grounds of Frederick the Great one of the key leaders in the history of Germany who had a range of diverse interests Beyond States craft including Arts design and agriculture. Well worth it visit to \u2026",
          "Sanssouci Palace is almost magical!  Our oldest daughter had her wedding photography done here and the photos are stunning!  We have visited again and found it to still be very lovely!  It reminds me of Versailles in a smaller context.  I highly recommend a visit here!",
          "Very beautiful castle and an intruiging story about the emperor, should visit when in Postdam!",
          "A wonderful experience with an excellent guide. It was an especially evocative experience as sunset fell.",

          "It is a beautifully preserved palace with ornately decorated rooms. One can spend hours in the gardens behind the palace. They are serene and beautiful with such lovely fountains. A must go when visiting Pottsdam",
          "Small but enchanting. There are about a dozen rooms to see, some quite lovely. The gardens are also very nice. Because of the size, this is much easier to assimilate than Versailles or the other large palaces. Don't miss the nearby bildergalerie if you like art. Highly recommended.",

          "The Place is really beautiful, but if you want to go inside you have to buy tickets which first of all are expensive (9 euro per Person) and if you want to take pictures inside you have to pay extra 3 Euros. And even if you decide to pay that much, the tickets where sold out at 12:00",

          "Very worth seeing and a must in Potsdam.",
          "Nice place to visit. I would recommend to visit it after mid April because the sculptures are saved in wood boxes and not opened before then. Also, during spring the weather is better and there are more flowers around the gardens.",
          "Audio-guides provide interesting, detailed historical information in various languages.  the Palace and the grounds of Sanssouci Park are well preserved.",
          "Beautiful site. Plan on spending the entire day. Take water and use the guide. Plan on walking more than the average, so wear comfortable shoes. \nIf you take the central station in, you should pick up some snacks and sandwhiches at the station.",

          "I loved the whole ideea behind the place and thematics",
          "Audioguides in place of spoken guided tours are a bit of a downer, but given the traffic this palace sees, I can understand why this isn't a thing.\n\nStaff are friendly enough, they speak serviceable English and there's a plethora of things \u2026",
          "Loved it here",
          "The place is marvelous. The park is very beautiful. You have to book tickets in advance, otherwise you have to wait.",

          "Never have thought I\u2019ll come for a second time when I first visit 9 years ago. It\u2019s a beautiful palace with splendid gardens, and Sanssouci  is indeed a fitting name in such Arcadian setting",

          "If you are visiting Berlin you can take the train to Potsdam in the morning and come back in the evening, totally worth it. Sanssouci Palace is beautiful itself, but then you also have the whole park and all the buildings surrounding it, just amazing. Maybe not the best option",
          "It was a very nice visit of this complex of palace and the gardens. We had a chance to visit it in autumn, and it was still very nice. But as I could imagine, during the spring, or summer, the garden should be spectacular.",

          "The Sanssouci Palace is a truly remarkable place. Its built for beauty and so it stays - I have been there in different times of year spring, summer and fall and it is pretty all the time. Its well worth spending the time here. Parking can be a problem especially when the",
          "Putting history aside, the palace is so simple. It is no doubt a beautiful sight to see, but nothing grand like palaces that I have seen in Europe. The garden in front of the palace is nice, and as you walk down the garden terrace, the view of the palace becomes prettier.",
          "I was expecting more from the visit. We had to come at a specific time to enter but after that the tour was very short only 10 minutes as a lot of the rooms were closed. The staff should definetely learn and speak better English and more importantly be more polite and friendly",

          "An easy train ride from Berlin gets you to Potsdam, a beautiful small town where the German royal family spent their summers hunting and riding. The Sanssouci Palace is perched above a vast park of fountains, statues, and endless walking paths. Well worth a visit to see inside",

          "Unlike the New Palace in the park, Sans Souci was themed for art and pleasure. Its human scale gives an insight into Old Fritz's personality, far from the autocratic Prussian image. The rococco rooms are well furbished. The library was designed for a short man, the armchair",
          "Sanssouci Palace is over the top, but, hey, it was the 18th century. If you enjoy this type of architecture, art, and design, go for it. If not, you may want to stick with the gardens, and the art gallery (separate price) has one fine Caravaggio painting.",

          "It is easy to get the train from the Berlin Zoological Gardens station to Potsdam through the woods. It takes about 45 minutes, and then a bus from Potsdam station to the palace. The journey is a model of German efficiency. This is a proper palace, but on a human scale. Unlike",

          "Built as a place to get away from it all (without worries), Frederick the Great built an amazing palace. First you will notice the vines cascading as you walk up the stairs to the top where the palace sits. Amazingly he grew his own grapes here. The palace overlooks the fountain",
          "One of a number of buildings in the extensive Sanssouci Gardens and probably the most-visited. Not a surprise, as the mix of baroque and rococo in the rooms is delightful. Numbers are limited in each room at any time so best to avoid the obviously busy periods. Come early in",
          "Very beautiful architecture and surrounding gardens. Some interesting history there, including the grave of Frederick the Great.",

          "Potsdam is a great day trip from Berlin and a chance to see Prussian history. As others noted Sanssouci is not huge but found it very interesting. The audio guides are well done--not too long. We went on a Wednesday afternoon and got an entry time within 30 minutes. We bought",
          "We took the RE1 from Alexander Platz to the Sanssouci Park stop and took a walk through the very large and beautiful park. This park can be explored for hours. There's a lot of great 18th century architecture scattered throughout. Once we got to the palace we realized it looks",

          "This is a huge palace. The gardens and courtyard entry are amazing in their scope and extreme architecture. The limited rooms available for viewing were exquisite but I felt the value for the limited viewing areas was not as expected.",
          "If you have not purchased your tickets beforehand, it\u2019s probably a smart move to buy them before exploring the Park more widely since entry is limited to relatively small groups at specific times. Once inside, you have plenty of time to take in the very good detailed commentary",

          "A good opportunity to learn more about the fascinating and melancholy story of Frederick the Great. Sanssouci palace is not large, but designed to maximize enjoyment of the outdoors. It was his summer respite from Berlin and reclines atop a remarkable terraced stairway",
          "The palace is amazing and majestic enough to compete with the most iconic palaces in Europe. The stairs that surround the palace are incredible.",
          "Sanssouci is a beautiful place. Sansoucci is a play on words, it was the palace of \"no worries\" built for Fredrick the Great. I have visited in all 4 seasons and it never fails to impress, but late Summer is the prettiest time to visit. There is no entrance fee to the grounds",
          "An interesting and very nice place to visit (both closet and garden). The price of the attraction is not cheap.",
          "The Sanssouci Palace and grounds are amazing and you could easily spend all day here exploring all the different buildings and gardens or hit the highlights in a couple of hours. Be prepared for a lot of walking though as these gardens are more than 2 kilometres long!",

          "Fridrich knew what is a castle. He let it build in a very fancy way. It seems from outside much more larger, than it is inside. If you want to visit - secure your ticket in advance. Be prepared, that it is always full with tourists, not only from abroad, but from Germany too.",
          "This is a beautiful location and building. We stopped by while driving through Germany. It was worth the stop, although I'm not sure that I would drive out of my way to go see it. The history surrounding Potsdam is interesting. It is a cute little town. We had our own car to get",

          "This was where Frederick the Great came to put his feet up and he did it in style. This is a small palace compared with Versailles or Sch\u00f6nbrunn, but that adds to its charm. It's on a human scale (single storey, for example) and the decoration is stunning. We had the guided tour",

          "The Sanssouci photographers and painters over the years have done this palace justice. It is beautiful but is not as large or grandiose as it sometimes seems in its depictions. The gardens are amazing and its well worth a visit to the palace.",
          "I visited Potsdam in the end of October, nice view everywhere. I really love Sanssourci park and I was surprised at Sanssourci palace. Amazing, wonderful... I cannot describe by my words. Sanssourci park with Sanssourci palace is enough for me in Potsdam! Highly recommend to",
          "This was one of the most beautiful palaces we've ever been to. Built by Frederick the Great as his summer home, this palace and it's environs are stunning. It is possible to take the tour of this palace in 40 minutes with a the audio guide. Ticket entrances are timed and sell",
          "We enjoyed walking through the gardens of the Sanssouci Palace. The fall views were beautiful around the grounds. Don't miss the spot where King Frederick was buried by his 11 dogs. Many of the locals continue leaving potatoes on his tomb.",

          "We had tired of the WWII -oriented history in Berlin and wanted a \"day off\", so we took the short ride on the S_Bahn to Potsdam, then took a 10 minute bus to the Sansouci Castle. The castle itself is smallish (only 5 or so guest rooms and 3 public rooms) and with the audio tour",
          "When Berlin seems a little crowded and busy, it's worth a day trip/half-day trip out to Potsdam to visit this mini-palace. Not as sumptuous as any of the Russian summer palaces, it still manages to shine - or at least glimmer a bit. Sign up for an admission time in the ticket",
          "This palace is located in Potsdam, Germany, just a short ride from Berlin. It is in excellent condition, and it is a miracle that it is still in such good condition after WWII. It was built by Frederick the II or Frederick the Great in the typical Rococo fashion. The marble",

          "I loved the garden. Among the many things that impressed me were all the fig trees that were planted along the terrace walls in the back of the palace. Glass doors kept the trees protected in the winter and now, on a beautiful summer day, they were wide open for the trees to",
          "This is the worst sight EVER. And this is coming from someone who normally does not avoid tourists traps. First, they have the price of the tickets divided so much so they charge more for what otherwise would have been a flat fee. The most outrageous aspect is that THEY",

          "Hard to believe this was built to be a summer palace. It is magnificent. The vineyards built into the hill leading up to the palace, the views, everything is just incredible. The only negative is that I wish they didn't keep curtains drawn in all the windows; it would be lovely",

        "wiki": "Potsdamer Platz (German: [\u02c8p\u0254tsdam\u0250 plats] (listen), literally Potsdam Square) is an important public square and traffic intersection in the center of Berlin, Germany, lying about 1 km (1,100 yd) south of the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag (German Parliament Building), and close to the southeast corner of the Tiergarten park. It is named after the city of Potsdam, some 25 km (16 mi) to the south west, and marks the point where the old road from Potsdam passed through the city wall of Berlin at the Potsdam Gate. After developing within the space of little over a century from an intersection of rural thoroughfares into the most bustling traffic intersection in Europe, it was totally destroyed during World War II and then left desolate during the Cold War era when the Berlin Wall bisected its former location. Since German reunification, Potsdamer Platz has been the site of major redevelopment projects.\n\n\n== Historical background ==\nPotsdamer Platz began as a trading post where several country roads converged just outside Berlin's old customs wall. The history of Potsdamer Platz can probably be traced back to 29 October 1685, when the Tolerance Edict of Potsdam was signed, whereby Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg-Prussia from 1640 to 1688, allowed large numbers of religious refugees, including Jews from Austria and Huguenots expelled from France, to settle on his territory.  A key motivation behind the Edict was so the Elector could encourage the rapid repopulation, restabilising and economic recovery of his kingdom, following the ravages of the Thirty Years' War (1618\u201348). Altogether up to 15,000 Huguenots made new homes in the Brandenburg region, some 6,000 of these in its capital, Berlin (indeed, by 1700 and for a while afterwards as much as 20% of Berlin's population was French-speaking). Two other things resulted from this huge influx. Firstly, Berlin's medieval fortifications, recently rebuilt from 1658 to 1674 in the form of a Dutch-style star fort, on an enormous scale and at great expense (and similar to examples still in extant today in the Netherlands like Naarden and Bourtange), became virtually redundant overnight; and secondly, the already crowded city became even more congested.\nSeveral new districts were founded around the city's perimeter, just outside the old fortifications. The largest of these was Friedrichstadt, just south west of the historic core of Berlin, begun in 1688 and named after new Elector Frederick William III, who later became King Frederick I of Prussia. Its street layout followed the Baroque-style grid pattern much favoured at the time, and was based on two main axes: Friedrichstra\u00dfe running north-south, and Leipziger Stra\u00dfe running east-west. All the new suburbs were absorbed into Berlin around 1709\u201310. In 1721-3 a south-westwards expansion of Friedrichstadt was planned under the orders of King Frederick William I, and this was completed in 1732-4 by architect Philipp Gerlach (1679\u20131748).  In this expansion, a new north-south axis emerged: Wilhelmstrasse.\nIn 1735-7, after Friedrichstadt's expansion was complete, a customs or excise wall, 17 km long and 4.2 m high, was erected around Berlin's new perimeter. Consisting of a wooden palisade at first, it was later replaced with a brick and stone wall, pierced by 14 gates (later increased to 18), where roads entered the city.  Here taxes were levied on goods passing through, chiefly meat and flour. The most prestigious gate was the Brandenburg Gate, for the important road from Brandenburg, but 1 km to the south was the entry point of another road that gained even greater significance.\nThis road had started out in the Middle Ages as a lane running out from Berlin to the hamlet of Sch\u00f6neberg, but it had developed into part of a trading route running right across Europe from Paris to St. Petersburg via Aachen, Berlin and K\u00f6nigsberg. In 1660 the Elector Frederick William made it his route of choice to Potsdam, the location of his palace, which had recently been renovated. Starting in 1754 a daily stagecoach ran between Berlin and Potsdam, although the road was in poor shape. But in 1740 Frederick II had become King. Not a great lover of Berlin, he later built a new palace, the Sanssouci, at Potsdam in 1744-7, followed by the New Palace in 1763-9, so the road now had to be made fit for a King, plus all his courtiers and staff. After numerous other improvements, in 1791-3 this section was made into Prussia's first all-weather road. It later became Potsdamer Stra\u00dfe; its point of entry into Berlin, where it passed through the customs wall, became the Potsdamer Tor (Potsdam Gate); once inside the gate Leipziger Stra\u00dfe was its eastwards continuation, and Wilhelmstra\u00dfe was the first north-south thoroughfare that intersected with it. It was around this gate that Potsdamer Platz was to develop.\nAs a physical entity, Potsdamer Platz began as a few country roads and rough tracks fanning out from the Potsdam Gate.  According to one old guide book, it was never a proper platz, but a five-cornered traffic knot on that old trading route across Europe. Just inside the gate was a large octagonal area, created at the time of Friedrichstadt's expansion in 1732-4 and bisected by Leipziger Stra\u00df; this was one of several parade grounds for the thousands of soldiers garrisoned in Berlin at the height of the Kingdom of Prussia. Initially known appropriately as the Achteck (Octagon), on 15 September 1814 it was renamed Leipziger Platz after the site of Prussia's final decisive defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Leipzig, 16\u201319 October 1813, which brought to an end the Wars of Liberation that had been going on since 1806. The Potsdam Gate itself was redesignated the Leipziger Tor (Leipzig Gate) around the same time, but reverted to its old name a few years later.\nThe history of Leipziger Platz has been inextricably linked with that of its neighbor almost since its creation. Yet their respective stories have in many ways been very different. The future Potsdamer Platz was most definitely outside Berlin, and therefore not subject to the planning guidelines and constraints that would normally be expected in a city keen to show itself off as the capital of an empire. It grew very rapidly in a piecemeal and haphazard way, and came to epitomise wildness and excess in a manner that contributed much to its legendary status. Leipziger Platz however, was inside the city (and had a name almost a century before its neighbor did), and always had an orderly, disciplined look about it. After all, it had been planned and built all in one go by Johann Philipp Gerlach.  One late 18th-century artistic depiction shows a range of buildings relentless in their uniformity. Indeed, this, together with the grid pattern of the streets, is what one would expect in Prussia's chief garrison city. One writer of the time said that a stroll round Friedrichstadt was like walking round military barracks. In this respect the Potsdam Gate was a dividing line between two different worlds. It was not until later on that many of these buildings began to be replaced by important historical palaces and aristocratic mansions.\nBy this time however, Leipziger Platz was no longer a parade ground, and there had been much speculation about a possible complete redesign for the whole area. Back in 1797 had come the first of two proposed schemes that would have afforded the future Potsdamer Platz the appearance of a proper square. Under both schemes the old rural intersection just outside the Potsdam Gate, and the Octagon (Leipziger Platz) just inside, were to be joined together to create a long rectangular space, with a gargantuan edifice standing in the middle of it. The 1797 scheme came from the renowned Prussian architect Friedrich David Gilly (1772\u20131800), who proposed a monument to the former Prussian King, Friedrich II. Though containing some Egyptian and French neo-Classicist features, the design was basically a huge Greek temple in the Doric style, loosely modelled on the Parthenon in Athens, though raised up on an enormous geometric plinth and flanked by numerous obelisks (the Egyptian element). A grand new Potsdam Gate formed part of the design.  It was never built, but eighteen years later in 1815 Gilly's pupil, Karl Friedrich Schinkel (1781\u20131841), put forward plans for a National Memorial Cathedral to commemorate the recent victories in the Wars of Liberation. To be known as the Residenzkirche, it was again, never built due to lack of funds, and in any case the national fervor of the period favored the long-awaited completion of Cologne Cathedral over a new building, but Schinkel went on to become one of the most prolific and celebrated architects of his time.\n\nSo the layout stayed put, although in 1823-4 Schinkel did get to rebuild the Potsdam Gate. Formerly little more than a gap in the customs wall, it was replaced by a much grander affair consisting of two matching Doric-style stone gate-houses, like little temples (a nod to Friedrich Gilly perhaps), facing each other across Leipziger Stra\u00dfe. The one on the north side served as the customs house and excise collection point, while its southern counterpart was a military guardhouse, set up to prevent desertions of Prussian soldiers, which had become a major problem. The new gate was officially dedicated on 23 August 1824. The design also included a new look for Leipziger Platz. Attempts to create a market there to draw off some of the frenetic commercial activity in the centre of the city had not been successful. And so Schinkel proposed to turn it into a fine garden, although this part of the design was not implemented. It was a rival plan by gardener and landscape architect Peter Joseph Lenn\u00e9 (1789\u20131866), drawn up in 1826, that went ahead in 1828 but with modifications. In later years Lenn\u00e9 would completely redesign the Tiergarten, a large wooded park formerly the Royal Hunting Grounds, also give his name to Lenn\u00e9stra\u00dfe, a thoroughfare forming part of the southern boundary of the park, very close to Potsdamer Platz, and transform a muddy ditch to the south into one of Berlin's busiest waterways, the Landwehrkanal.\n\nMeanwhile, country peasantry were generally not welcome in the city, and so the gates also served to restrict access.  However, the country folk were permitted to set up trading posts of their own just outside the gates, and the Potsdam Gate especially. It was hoped that this would encourage development of all the country lanes into proper roads; in turn it was hoped that these would emulate Parisian boulevards\u2014broad, straight and magnificent, but the main intention was to enable troops to be moved quickly. Thus Potsdamer Platz was off and running.\nIt was not called that until 8 July 1831, but the area outside the Potsdam Gate began to develop in the early 19th century as a district of quiet villas, for as Berlin became even more congested, many of its richer citizens moved outside the customs wall and built spacious new homes around the trading post, along the newly developing boulevards, and around the southern edge of the Tiergarten. Initially the development was fairly piecemeal, but in 1828 this area just to the west of Potsdamer Platz, sandwiched between the Tiergarten and the north bank of the future Landwehrkanal, received Royal approval for a more orderly and purposeful metamorphosis into a residential colony of the affluent, and gradually filled with houses and villas of a particularly palatial nature. These became the homes of civil servants, officers, bankers, artists and politicians among others, and earned the area the nickname \"Millionaires' Quarter\" although its official designation was Friedrichvorstadt (Friedrich's Suburb), or alternatively the Tiergartenviertel (Tiergarten Quarter).\nMany of the properties in the neighborhood were the work of architect Georg Friedrich Heinrich Hitzig (1811\u201381), a pupil of Schinkel who also built the original \"English Embassy\" in Leipziger Platz, where the vast Wertheim department store would later stand, although Friedrichvorstadt's focal point and most notable building was the work of another architect\u2014and another pupil of Schinkel.  The Matthiaskirche (St. Matthew's Church), built in 1844-6, was an Italian Romanesque-style building in alternating bands of red and yellow brick, and designed by Friedrich August St\u00fcler (1800\u201365). This church, one of fewer than half a dozen surviving pre-World War II buildings in the entire area, forms the centrepiece of today's Kulturforum (Cultural Forum).\nMeanwhile, many of the Huguenots fleeing religious persecution in France, and their descendants, had also been living around the trading post and cultivating local fields.  Noticing that traffic queues often built up at the Potsdam Gate due to delays in making the customs checks, these people had begun to offer coffee, bread, cakes and confectionery from their homes or from roadside stalls to travelers passing through, thus beginning the tradition of providing food and drink around the future Potsdamer Platz. In later years larger and more purpose-built establishments had begun to take their place, which in turn were superseded by even bigger and grander ones. The former district of quiet villas was by now anything but quiet: Potsdamer Platz had taken on an existence all its own whose sheer pace of life rivalled anything within the city.\nBy the mid-1860s direct taxation had made the customs wall redundant, and so in 1866\u20137 most of it was demolished along with all the city gates except two \u2013 the Brandenburg Gate and the Potsdam Gate. The removal of the customs wall allowed its former route to be turned into yet another road running through Potsdamer Platz, thus increasing still further the amount of traffic passing through. This road, both north and south of the platz, was named K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tzer Stra\u00dfe after the Prussian victory over Austria at the Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz on 3 July 1866, in the Austro-Prussian War.\n\n\n== The railways arrive ==\n\nThe railway first came to Berlin in 1838, with the opening of the Potsdamer Bahnhof, terminus of a 26 km line linking the city with Potsdam, opened throughout by 29 October (in 1848 the line would be extended to Magdeburg and beyond). Since the city authorities would not allow the new line to breach the customs wall, still standing at the time, it had to stop just short, at Potsdamer Platz, but it was this that kick-started the real transformation of the area, into the bustling focal point that Potsdamer Platz would eventually become.\nJust three years later a second railway terminus opened in the vicinity. Located 600 meters to the southeast, with a front facade facing Askanischer Platz, the Anhalter Bahnhof was the Berlin terminus of a line opened on 1 July 1841, as far as J\u00fcterbog and later extended to Dessau, Kothen and beyond.\nBoth termini began life as fairly modest affairs, but in order to cope with increasing demands both went on to much bigger and better things in later years, a new Potsdamer Bahnhof, destined to be Berlin's busiest station, opening on 30 August 1872 and a new Anhalter Bahnhof, destined to be the city's biggest and finest, following on 15 June 1880. This latter station benefitted greatly from the closure of a short-lived third terminus in the area \u2013 the Dresdner Bahnhof, located south of the Landwehrkanal, which lasted from 17 June 1875 until 15 October 1882.\nIn addition, a railway line once ran through Potsdamer Platz itself. This was a connecting line opened in October 1851 and running around the city just inside the customs wall, crossing numerous streets and squares at street level, and whose purpose was to allow goods to be transported between the various Berlin stations, thus creating a hated traffic obstruction that lasted for twenty years. Half a dozen or more times a day, Potsdamer Platz ground to a halt while a train of 60 to 100 wagons trundled through at walking pace preceded by a railway official ringing a bell. The construction of the Ringbahn around the city's perimeter, linked to all the major stations, allowed the connecting line to be scrapped in 1871, although the Ringbahn itself was not complete and open for all traffic until 15 November 1877.\nIn later years Potsdamer Platz was served by both of Berlin's two local rail systems. The U-Bahn arrived first, from the south; begun on 10 September 1896, it opened on 18 February 1902, with a new and better sited station being provided on 29 September 1907, and the line itself being extended north and east on 1 October 1908. In 1939 the S-Bahn followed, its North-South Link between Unter den Linden and Yorckstra\u00dfe opening in stages during the year, the Potsdamer Platz S-Bahn station itself opening on 15 April.\n\nBy the second half of the 19th century, Berlin had been growing at a tremendous rate for some time, but its growth accelerated even faster after the city became the capital of the new German Empire on 18 January 1871. Potsdamer Platz and neighbouring Leipziger Platz really started coming into their own from this time on. Now firmly in the centre of a metropolis whose population eventually reached 4.4 million, making it the third largest city in the world after London and New York, the area was ready to take on its most celebrated role. Vast hotels and department stores, hundreds of smaller shops, theatres, dance-halls, caf\u00e9s, restaurants, bars, beer palaces, wine-houses and clubs, all started to appear. Some of these places became internationally known.\nAlso, a very large government presence, with many German imperial departments, Prussian state authorities and their various sub-departments, came into the area, taking over 26 former palaces and aristocratic mansions in Leipziger Platz, Leipziger Stra\u00dfe and Wilhelmstra\u00dfe. Even the Reichstag itself, the German Parliament, occupied the former home of the family of composer Felix Mendelssohn (1809\u201347) in Leipziger Stra\u00dfe before moving in 1894 to the vast new edifice near the Brandenburg Gate, erected by Paul Wallot (1841\u20131912). Next door, the Herrenhaus, or Prussian House of Lords (the Upper House of the Prussian State Parliament), occupied a former porcelain factory for a while, before moving to an impressive new building erected on the site of the former Mendelssohn family home in 1899\u20131904 by Friedrich Schulze Colditz (1843\u20131912). This building backed on to an equally grand edifice in the next street (Prinz-Albrecht-Stra\u00dfe), also by Colditz, that had been built for the Preu\u00dfischer Landtag (the Prussian Lower House), in 1892-9.\nPotsdamer Platz was also the location of Germany's first electric street lights, installed in 1882 by the electrical giant Siemens, founded and based in the city.\n\n\n== Interwar years ==\n\nThe heyday of Potsdamer Platz was in the 1920s and 1930s. By this time it had developed into the busiest traffic center in all of Europe, and the heart of Berlin's nightlife. It had acquired an iconic status, on a par with Piccadilly Circus in London or Times Square in New York. It was a key location that helped to symbolize Berlin; it was known worldwide, and a legend grew up around it. It represented the geographical center of the city, the meeting place of five of its busiest streets in a star-shaped intersection deemed the transport hub of the entire continent. These were:\n\nK\u00f6niggr\u00e4tzer Stra\u00dfe (northern portion), earlier names Brandenburgische Communication and then Schulgartenstra\u00dfe, running along the former route of the customs wall and leading north to the Brandenburg Gate. After a brief spell as Budapester Stra\u00dfe in the late 1920s (although this name was not widely recognised), on 6 February 1930 it was renamed Ebertstra\u00dfe after Friedrich Ebert (1871\u20131925), first President of Weimar Germany. In 1935 the Nazis renamed it Hermann-G\u00f6ring-Stra\u00dfe after Reichsmarschall Hermann G\u00f6ring, whose official residence was on the east side of the street near the Brandenburg Gate. On 31 July 1947, it reverted to Ebertstra\u00dfe again.\nK\u00f6niggr\u00e4tzer Stra\u00dfe (southern portion), earlier names Potsdamer Communication and then Hirschelstra\u00dfe, also running along part of the customs wall's old route, actually leading mainly south east. On 6 February 1930, it was renamed Stresemannstra\u00dfe after Gustav Stresemann (1878\u20131929), the first Chancellor to serve under President Ebert. In 1935 the Nazis renamed it Saarlandstra\u00dfe after the region of south western Germany that had been under League of Nations rule since the end of World War I but which on 13 January 1935 elected by a huge (90.3%) majority to return to Germany. On 31 July 1947, it reverted to Stresemannstra\u00dfe.\nLeipziger Stra\u00dfe, leading east.\nPotsdamer Stra\u00dfe, developed out of that old road to Sch\u00f6neberg and Potsdam, part of the former trading route across Europe, and leading south west. Today this section is called Alte Potsdamer Stra\u00dfe, a pedestrianised cul-de-sac severed by post-World War II developments and subsequently by-passed by a new section \u2013 the Neue Potsdamer Stra\u00dfe, leading due west and then curving southwards to rejoin its old course at the Potsdam Bridge, over the Landwehrkanal.\nBellevuestra\u00dfe, earlier name Charlottenburger Allee, leading north west through the Tiergarten to Schloss Bellevue, today the official residence of the Federal President of Germany.\nAs well as the stations and other facilities and attractions already mentioned, in the immediate area was one of the world's biggest and most luxurious department stores: Wertheim. Founded by German merchant Georg Wertheim (1857\u20131939), designed by architect Alfred Messel (1853\u20131909), opened in 1897 and extended several times over the following 40 years, it ultimately possessed a floor area double that of the Reichstag, a 330-metre-long granite and plate glass facade along Leipziger Stra\u00dfe, 83 elevators, three escalators, 1,000 telephones, 10,000 lamps, five kilometers of pneumatic tubing for moving items from the various departments to the packing area, and a separate entrance directly from the nearby U-Bahn station. It also contained a summer garden, winter garden and roof garden, an enormous restaurant and several smaller eating areas, its own laundry, a theater and concert booking office, its own bank, whose strongrooms were underground at the eastern end of the building (and generated their own history decades later), and a large fleet of private delivery vehicles. In the run-up to Christmas Wertheim was transformed into a fairytale kingdom, and was well known to children from all over Germany and far beyond.\n\nIn Stresemannstra\u00dfe, and paralleling the Potsdamer Bahnhof on its eastern side, was another great magnet for shoppers and tourists alike \u2013 a huge multi-national-themed eating establishment: the Haus Vaterland. Designed by architect Franz Heinrich Schwechten (1841\u20131924), who was also responsible for the Anhalter Bahnhof and the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, it was erected in 1911\u201312 as the Haus Potsdam. 93 m in length and with a dome rising 35 m above the pavement at the north (Stresemannstra\u00dfe) end, it contained the world's largest restaurant \u2013 the 2,500-seat Caf\u00e9 Piccadilly, plus a 1,200-seat theatre and numerous offices. These included (from 1917 to 1927), the headquarters of Universum Film AG (aka UFA or Ufa), Germany's biggest film company.\nOn 16 August 1914, less than three weeks after the start of World War I, the Caf\u00e9 Piccadilly was given a new name \u2013 the more patriotic-sounding Caf\u00e9 Vaterland. However, in 1927\u20138 the architect and entrepreneur Carl Stahl-Urach (1879\u20131933) transformed the whole building into a gastronomic fantasy land, financed and further elaborated upon by new owners the Kempinski organisation. It reopened on 31 August 1928 as the Haus Vaterland, offering \"The World in One House,\" and could now hold up to 8,000 guests at a time. The Caf\u00e9 Vaterland had remained largely untouched, but the 1,200-seat theatre was now a 1,400-seat cinema. The rest of the building had been turned into a large number of theme restaurants, all served from a central kitchen containing the largest gas-fueled cooking plant in Europe. These included: Rheinterrasse, L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u (Bavarian beer restaurant), Grinzing (Viennese caf\u00e9 and wine bar), Bodega (Spanish winery), Csarda (Hungarian), Wild West Bar (aka the Arizona Bar) (American), Osteria (Italian), Komb\u00fcse (Bremen drinking den \u2013 literally \"galley\"), R\u00fcbchen (Teltow, named after the well-known turnip dish Teltower R\u00fcbchen, made with turnips grown locally in the small town of Teltow just outside Berlin), plus a Turkish caf\u00e9 and Japanese tearoom; additionally there was a large ballroom. Up to eight orchestras and dance bands regularly performed in different parts of the building, plus a host of singers, dancers and other entertainers. It should be pointed out here though that not all of these attractions existed simultaneously, owing to changes in those countries that Germany was or was not allied to, in the volatile years leading up to and during World War II, a good example being the closure of the Wild West Bar following America's entry into the war as an enemy of Germany.\nAmong the major hotels at or near Potsdamer Platz were two designed by the same architect, Otto Rehnig (1864\u20131925), and opened in the same year, 1908. One was the 600-room Hotel Esplanade (sometimes known as the \"Grand Hotel Esplanade\"), in Bellevuestra\u00dfe. Charlie Chaplin and Greta Garbo were guests there, and Kaiser Wilhelm II himself held regular \"gentlemen's evenings\" and other functions there in a room that came to be named after him \u2013 the Kaisersaal.\nThe other was the Hotel Excelsior, also 600 rooms but superior provision of other facilities made it the largest hotel in Continental Europe, located in Stresemannstra\u00dfe opposite the Anhalter Bahnhof and connected to it by a 100-metre-long subterranean passageway complete with a parade of underground shops.\nTwo other hotels which shared the same architect, in this case Ludwig Heim (1844\u20131917), were the 68-room Hotel Bellevue (sometimes known as the \"Grand Hotel Bellevue\"), built 1887-8, and the 110-room Palast Hotel, built 1892-3 on the site of an earlier hotel. These stood on either side of the northern exit from Potsdamer Platz along Ebertstra\u00dfe. The Bellevue was well known for its Winter Garden.\nMeanwhile, facing the Palast Hotel across the entrance to Leipziger Platz (the Potsdam Gate), was the 400-room Hotel F\u00fcrstenhof, by Richard Bielenberg (1871\u20131929) and Josef Moser (1872\u20131963), erected in 1906/07, also on the site of an earlier building. With its 200-metre-long main facade along Stresemannstra\u00dfe, the F\u00fcrstenhof was less opulent than some of the other hotels mentioned, despite its size, but was still popular with business people. The new U-Bahn station was being built at the same time as the hotel and actually ran through the hotel's basement, cutting it in half, thus making the construction of both into something of a technical challenge, but unlike the Wertheim department store (and contrary to several sources), the hotel did not enjoy a separate entrance directly from the station.\nThe Weinhaus Huth, with its distinctive corner cupola, was a wedge-shaped structure located in the angle between Potsdamer Stra\u00dfe and Linkstra\u00dfe (literally \"Left Street\"), and with entrances in both streets. Wine merchant Friedrich Karl Christian Huth, whose great-grandfather had been kellermeister (cellar-master) to King Friedrich II back in 1769, had founded the firm in 1871 and taken over the former building in Potsdamer Stra\u00dfe on 23 March 1877. His son, the wine wholesale dealer William (\"Willy\") Huth (1877\u20131967), took over the business in 1904 and, a few years later, commissioned the replacement of the building by a new one on the same site. Running right through the block into Linkstra\u00dfe, this new Weinhaus Huth was designed by the architects Conrad Heidenreich (1873\u20131937) and Paul Michel (1877\u20131938), and opened on 2 October 1912, and contained a wine restaurant on the ground floor, and wine storage space above, so it had to take a lot of weight. It was thus given a strong steel skeleton, which would stand the building in very good stead some three decades after its completion. Famous for its fine claret, numerous members of European society were made welcome there as guests. A total of 15 chefs were employed there, and Alois Hitler Jr., the stepbrother of the future Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, was a waiter there in the 1920s, before he opened his own restaurant and hotel at Wittenbergplatz, in the western part of the city.\nCaf\u00e9 Josty was one of two rival caf\u00e9s (the other being the Astoria, later Caf\u00e9 Eins A), occupying the broad corner between Potsdamer Stra\u00dfe and Bellevuestra\u00dfe. The Josty company had been founded in 1793 by two Swiss brothers, Johann and Daniel Josty, who had emigrated to Berlin from Sils in Switzerland and set up a bakery from which the caf\u00e9 was a 1796 offshoot. It had occupied various locations including (from 1812 till 1880), a site in front of the Berlin City Palace, before moving to Potsdamer Platz in the latter year. A major player on the Berlin caf\u00e9 scene, Josty attracted writers, artists, politicians and international society: it was one of the places to be seen. The writer Theodor Fontane, painter Adolf von Menzel, and Dadaist Kurt Schwitters were all guests; Karl Liebknecht, the Spartacus Communist movement leader read a lot here and even made some key political speeches from the pavement terrace, while author Erich K\u00e4stner wrote part of his 1929 bestseller for children, Emil und die Detektive (Emil and the Detectives), on the same terrace and made the caf\u00e9 the setting for an important scene in the book.\nDespite the prestige associated with its name, Caf\u00e9 Josty closed in 1930. It then went through an odyssey of re-openings, closures and relaunches under a number of different names including Conditorei Friediger, Caf\u00e9 Wiener, Engelhardt Brau and Kaffee Potsdamer Platz (sometimes appearing to have two or more names simultaneously), before its eventual destruction in World War II.\nAmong the many beer palaces around Potsdamer Platz were two in particular which contained an extensive range of rooms and halls covering a large area. The Alt-Bayern in Potsdamer Stra\u00dfe was erected by architect Wilhelm Walther (1857\u20131917) and opened in 1904. After closing in 1914, it underwent a revamp before reopening in 1926 under the new name Bayernhof.\nMeanwhile, in Bellevuestra\u00dfe, sandwiched between Caf\u00e9 Josty and the Hotel Esplanade but extending right through the block with a separate entrance in Potsdamer Stra\u00dfe, was the Weinhaus Rheingold, built by Bruno Schmitz (1858\u20131916) and opened on 6 February 1907. Originally intended to be a concert venue until concerns were raised about increased traffic problems in the already congested streets, it was ruled that it should serve a gastronomic purpose only. Altogether it could accommodate 4,000 guests at a time, 1,100 of these in its main hall alone. Many of the total of 14 banquet and beer halls had a Wagnerian theme \u2013 indeed, the very name of the complex was taken from the Wagner opera Das Rheingold, the first of the four parts of the cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen, although this name did hark back to the building's planned former role as a concert venue. Another building by the same architect but which still stands \u2013 the \"Rosengarten\" in Mannheim, has a remarkably similar main facade.\nFinally, on the corner between Potsdamer Stra\u00dfe and the Potsdamer Bahnhof, stood Bierhaus Siechen, built by Johann Emil Schaudt (1874\u20131957), opened in 1910 and later relaunched under the new name Pschorr-Haus.\nAt 8.00 p.m. on 8 October 1923, Germany's first radio broadcast was made, using the world's first medium-wave transmitter, from a building (Vox-Haus) close by in Potsdamer Stra\u00dfe. Standing alongside the Weinhaus Rheingold's Potsdamer Stra\u00dfe entrance, this five-storey steel-framed edifice had been erected as an office building in 1907-8 by architect and one-time Berlin inspector of buildings Otto Stahn (1859\u20131930), who was also responsible for the city's Oberbaumbr\u00fccke over the River Spree. In 1920 the Vox-group had taken over the building and the following year commissioned its remodelling by Swiss architect Rudolf Otto Salvisberg (1882\u20131940), and then erected two transmitting antennae. Despite several upgrades between December 1923 and July 1924, the nearby Hotel Esplanade's formidable bulk prevented the transmitter from functioning effectively and so in December 1924 it was superseded by a better sited new one, but Vox-Haus lived on as the home of Germany's first radio station, Radiostunde Berlin, founded in 1923, renamed Funkstunde in March 1924, but it moved to a new home in 1931 and closed in 1934.\nIn addition, the former Millionaires' Quarter just to the west of Potsdamer Platz had become a much favoured location for other countries to site their embassies. By the early 1930s there were so many diplomats living and working in the area that it came to be redesignated the \"Diplomatic Quarter\". By 1938, 37 out of 52 embassies and legations in Berlin, and 28 out of 29 consulates, were situated here.\n\nThe first traffic light tower in Germany was erected at Potsdamer Platz on 20 October 1924 and went into service on 15. December 1924 in an attempt to control the sheer volume of traffic passing through.This traffic had grown to extraordinary levels. Even in 1900, more than 100,000 people, 20,000 cars, horse-drawn vehicles and handcarts, plus many thousands of bicycles, passed through the platz daily. By the 1920s the number of cars had soared to 60,000. The trams added greatly to this. The first four lines had appeared in 1880, rising to 13 by 1897, all horse-drawn, but after electrification between 1898 and 1902 the number of lines had soared to 35 by 1908 and ultimately reached 40, carrying between them 600 trams every hour, day and night. Services were run by a large number of companies.\nAfter 1918 most of the tram companies joined. In 1923, at the peak of the Hyperinflation the tram traffic was stopped for two days and a new communal company called Berliner Stra\u00dfenbahn-Betriebs-GmbH was founded. Finally in 1929 all communal traffic companies (Underground, Tram and Buses) were unified into the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (Berlin Transport Services) company.\nAt the Potsdamer Platz up to 11 policemen at a time had tried to control all this traffic but with varying success. The delays in tram traffic increased and the job was very dangerous for the policemen. The Berliner Stra\u00dfenbahn-Betriebs-GmbH started researches to control the traffic on the main streets and places in 1924. Berlin traffic experts visits colleagues Paris, London and New York. They had to organize the traffic, define traffic rules and select a solution to control the traffic. In New York, Fifth Avenue they found traffic light towers designed by Joseph H. Freedlander in 1922 which can be regarded as a model for the Berlin tower.\nThe Potsdamer Platz five-sided 8.5 m high traffic tower was designed by Jean Kramer, a German architect. The traffic lights were delivered by Siemens & Halske and mounted on top of the tower cabin. A solitary policeman sat in a small cabin at the top of the tower and switched the lights around manually, until they were automated in 1926. Yet some officers still remained on the ground in case people did not pay any attention to the lights. The tower remained until October 1937, when it was removed to allow for excavations for the new S-Bahn underground line. On 26 September 1997, a replica of the tower was erected, just for show, close to its original location by Siemens, to celebrate the company's 150th anniversary. The replica was moved again on 29 September 2000, to the place where it stands today.\n\nThe traffic problems that had blighted Potsdamer Platz for decades continued to be a big headache, despite the new lights, and these led to a strong desire to solve them once and for all. By now Berlin was a major centre of innovation in many different fields including architecture. In addition, the city's colossal pace of change (compared by some to that of Chicago), had caused its chief planner, Martin Wagner (1885\u20131957), to foresee the entire centre being made over totally as often as every 25 years. These factors combined to produce some far more radical and futuristic plans for Potsdamer Platz in the late 1920s and early 1930s, especially around 1928-9, when the creative fervour was at its peak. On the cards was an almost total redevelopment of the area. One design submitted by Wagner himself comprised an array of gleaming new buildings arranged around a vast multi-level system of fly-overs and underpasses, with a huge glass-roofed circular car-park in the middle. Unfortunately the worldwide Great Depression of the time, triggered by the Wall Street Crash of 1929, meant that most of the plans remained on the drawing board. However, in Germany this depression was virtually a continuation of an economic morass that had blighted the country since the end of World War I, partly the result of the war reparations the country had been made to pay, and this morass had brought about the closure and demolition of the Grand Hotel Belle Vue, on the corner of Bellevuestra\u00dfe and K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tzer Stra\u00dfe, thus enabling one revolutionary new building to struggle through to reality despite considerable financial odds.\nColumbushaus was the result of a plan by the French retail company Les Galeries Lafayette, whose flagship store was the legendary Galeries Lafayette in Paris, to open a counterpart in Berlin, on the Grand Hotel Belle Vue's former site, but financial worries made them pull out. Undaunted, the architect, Erich Mendelsohn (1887\u20131953), erected vast advertising boards around the perimeter of the site, and the revenue generated by these enabled him to proceed with the development anyway. Columbushaus was a ten-storey ultra-modern office building, years ahead of its time, containing Germany's first artificial ventilation system, and whose elegance and clean lines won it much praise. However, despite a Woolworths store on its ground floor, a major travel company housed on the floor above, and a restaurant offering fine views over the city from the top floor, the economic situation of the time meant that it would not be followed by more buildings in that vein: no further redevelopment in the immediate vicinity of Potsdamer Platz occurred prior to World War II, and so Columbushaus would always seem out of place in that location. Nevertheless, its exact position showed that the platz was starting to be opened out: the former hotel had mostly stood on a large flagged area laid out in front of it, indicating that the new building curved away from the existing street line; this would have enabled future street widening to take place.\n\n\n== Hitler and Germania Plans ==\nColumbushaus was completed and opened in January 1933, the same month that the Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler (1889\u20131945) came to power. Hitler had big plans for Berlin, to transform it into the Welthauptstadt (World Capital) Germania, to be realised by his architect friend Albert Speer (1905\u201381). Under these plans the immediate vicinity of Potsdamer Platz would have got off fairly lightly, although the Potsdamer Bahnhof (and the Anhalter Bahnhof a short distance away) would have lost their function. The new North-South Axis, the linchpin of the scheme, would have severed their approach tracks, leaving both termini stranded on the wrong side of it. All trains arriving in Berlin would have run into either of two vast new stations located on the Ringbahn to the north and south of the centre respectively, to be known as Nordbahnhof (North Station) and S\u00fcdbahnhof (South Station), located at Wedding and S\u00fcdkreuz. In Speer's plan the former Anhalter Bahnhof was earmarked to become a public swimming pool; the intended fate of the Potsdamer Bahnhof has not been documented.\nMeanwhile, the North-South Axis would have cut a giant swathe passing just to the west of Potsdamer Platz, some 5 km long and up to 100 m wide, and lined with Nazi government edifices on a gargantuan scale. The eastern half of the former Millionaires' Quarter, including St\u00fcler's Matthiaskirche, would have been totally eradicated. New U-Bahn and S-Bahn lines were planned to run directly beneath almost the whole length of the axis, and the city's entire underground network reoriented to gravitate towards this new hub (at least one tunnel section, around 220 metres in length, was actually constructed and still exists today, buried some 20 metres beneath the Tiergarten, despite having never seen a train). This was in addition to the S-Bahn North-South Link beneath Potsdamer Platz itself, which went forward to completion, opening in stages in 1939. In the event, a substantial amount of demolition did take place in Potsdamer Stra\u00dfe, between the platz itself and the Landwehrkanal, and this became the location of the one Germania building that actually went forward to a state of virtual completion: architect Theodor Dierksmeier's Haus des Fremdenverkehrs (House of Tourism), basically a giant state-run travel agency. More significantly, its curving eastern facade marked the beginnings of the Runden Platz (Round Platz), a huge circular public space at the point where the North-South Axis and Potsdamer Stra\u00dfe intersected. Additionally, the southern edge of the Tiergarten was to be redefined, with a new road planned to slice through the built-up area immediately to the north of Columbushaus (although Columbushaus itself would remain unscathed); this road would line up with Vo\u00dfstra\u00dfe, one block to the north of Leipziger Platz. Here Albert Speer erected Hitler's enormous new Reichskanzlei building, and yet even this was little more than a dry run for an even larger structure some distance further away.\nMeanwhile, the Nazi influence was no less evident at Potsdamer Platz than anywhere else in Berlin. As well as swastika flags and propaganda everywhere, Nazi-affiliated concerns occupied a great many buildings in the area, especially Columbushaus, where they took over most of the upper floors. As if to emphasise their presence, they used the building to advertise their own weekly publication: a huge neon sign on its roof proclaimed DIE BRAUNE POST \u2013 N.S. SONNTAGSZEITUNG (The Brown Post \u2013 N.S. Sunday Newspaper), the N.S. standing for Nationalsozialist (National Socialist), i.e. Nazi. Probably Potsdamer Platz's most prominent landmark in the mid-1930s, the sign first appears in photographs dated 1935 but was gone again by 1938. On an even darker note, those Nazi concerns included the Gestapo, who set up a secret prison in an upper part of the building, complete with interrogation and torture rooms. Meanwhile, in another part of the building, the Information Office of the Olympic Games Organising Committee was housed. Here much of the planning of the 1936 Berlin Summer Olympic Games took place.\n\n\n== World War II ==\n\nAs was the case in most of central Berlin, almost all of the buildings around Potsdamer Platz were turned to rubble by air raids and heavy artillery bombardment during the last years of World War II. The three most destructive raids (out of 363 that the city suffered), occurred on 23 November 1943, and 3 and 26 February 1945. Things were not helped by the very close proximity of Hitler's Reich Chancellery, just one block away in Vo\u00dfstra\u00dfe, and many other Nazi government edifices nearby as well, and so Potsdamer Platz was right in a major target area.\nOnce the bombing and shelling had largely ceased, the ground invasion began as Soviet forces stormed the centre of Berlin street by street, building by building, aiming to capture the Reich Chancellery and other key symbols of the Nazi government. When the city was divided into sectors by the occupying Allies at the end of the war, the square found itself on the boundary between the American, British and Soviet sectors.\nDespite all the devastation, commercial life reappeared in the ruins around Potsdamer Platz within just a few weeks of war's end. The lower floors of a few buildings were patched up enough to allow business of a sort to resume. The U-Bahn and S-Bahn were partially operational again from 2 June 1946, fully from 16 November 1947 (although repairs were not completed until May 1948) and trams by 1952. Part of the Haus Vaterland reopened in 1948 in a much simplified form. The new East German state-owned retail business H.O. (Handelsorganisation, meaning Trading Organisation), had seized almost all of Wertheim's former assets in the newly created German Democratic Republic but, unable to start up the giant Leipziger Platz store again (it was too badly damaged), it opened a new Kaufhaus (department store) on the ground floor of Columbushaus. An office of the Kasernierte Volkspolizei (literally \"Barracked People's Police\") \u2013 the military precursor of the Nationale Volksarmee (National People's Army), occupied the floor above. Meanwhile, a row of new single-storey shops was erected along Potsdamer Stra\u00dfe. Out on the streets, even the flower-sellers, for whom the area had once been renowned, were doing brisk business again.\nThe area around Potsdamer Platz had also become a focus for black market trading.  Since the American, British and Soviet Occupation Zones converged there, people theoretically only had to walk a few paces across sector boundaries to avoid the respective police officials.\n\n\n== The Cold War ==\n\nMeanwhile, friction between the Western Allies and Soviets was steadily rising. The Soviets even took to marking out their border by stationing armed soldiers along it at intervals of a few metres, day and night, in all weathers. Since there was not, as yet, a fixed marker, the borders were prone to abuse, which eventually resulted (in August 1948), in white lines in luminous paint appearing across roads and even through ruined buildings to try to deter the Soviets from making unauthorised incursions into the American and British zones. These measures were only partially successful: after further skirmishes in which shots were fired, barbed wire entanglements were stretched across some roads, a foretaste of things to come.\n\n\n=== The free Berlin press versus the wise Berliner ===\nRemembering the effective use of propaganda in the leadup to the second World War, the opposing camps later began berating one another with enormous signs displaying loud political slogans, facing each other across the border zone. That on the western side was erected first, in direct response to the ban on sales of Western newspapers in East Berlin, and comprised an illuminated display board 30 m wide and 1.5 m deep, facing east, supported on three steel lattice towers 25 m high and topped by the words DIE FREIE BERLINER PRESSE MELDET (The Free Berlin Press Announces). Important messages were spelt out on the display board using up to 2,000 bulbs. The sign was switched on for the first time on 10 October 1950, watched by a large crowd. A month later, on 18 November, the Communist authorities in the east ordered its destruction using a catapult made from a compressed air hose loaded with pebbles and small pieces of metal. However, the order was not executed and the sign lasted until 1974, an eventual victim of its own high maintenance costs.\nNot to be outdone, East Berlin had meanwhile erected a sign of its own. This was up and running by 25 November 1950, less than seven weeks after its western counterpart, albeit for a much shorter time period. (It was demolished on 29 January 1953.) Facing towards West Berlin was the proclamation DER KLUGE BERLINER KAUFT BEI DER H.O. (The Wise Berliner Buys With The HO) Underneath were the words N\u00c4CHSTE VERKAUFSSTELLEN (Next Sales Premises), between two arrows pointing left and right, suggesting that large shopping developments were forthcoming in the immediate vicinity, although these never appeared.\nWhat was not apparent from the western side however, was that East Berlin's construction boasted its own illuminated display board facing east, whose messages comprised the version of the news that the Communist authorities in the east wanted their citizens to believe. In addition, the East Berlin sign was carefully placed so that, when viewed from further away down Leipziger Stra\u00dfe, its display board obscured the West Berlin sign standing beyond it. Over the next two years, West Berlin would regularly raise or lower its sign to make it more easily visible from the East again \u2013 and then East Berlin would raise or lower its own construction to obscure it once more. Furthermore, the East German Government also exploited the huge facade of the nearby Columbushaus as a further propaganda tool.\n\n\n=== The 1953 uprising ===\nMore significantly, living and working conditions in East Germany were rapidly worsening under Communist rule. Tensions finally reached breaking point and a Workers\u2019 Uprising took place on 17 June 1953, to be quickly and brutally crushed when Soviet tanks rolled in, and some of the worst violence occurred around Potsdamer Platz, where several people were killed by the Volkspolizei. No one really knows how many people died during the uprising itself, or by the subsequent death sentences. There are 55 known victims, but other estimates state at least 125. West German estimates were much higher: in 1966 the West German Ministry for Inter-German Affairs claimed that 383 people died in the uprising, including 116 \"functionaries of the SED regime\", with an additional 106 executed under martial law or later condemned to death, while 1,838 were injured and 5,100 arrested, 1,200 of these later being sentenced to a total of 6,000 years in penal camps. It was also claimed that 17 or 18 Soviet soldiers were executed for refusing to shoot demonstrating workers, but this remains unconfirmed by post-1990 research. Whatever the casualty figures, for the second time in eight years, the \"busiest and most famous square in Europe\" had been transformed into a bloody battleground. Columbushaus, with its H.O. store on the ground floor and military police station above, had been a prime target in the insurrection and been burnt out yet again, along with the Haus Vaterland and other premises. This time, they were not rehabilitated.\nAs Cold War tensions rose still further during the 1950s, restrictions were placed on travel between the Soviet sector (East Berlin) and the western sectors (West Berlin). For the second time in its history, the Potsdam Gate (or what remained of it), was like a dividing line between two different worlds. Lying on this invisible frontier, Potsdamer Platz was no longer an important destination for Berliners. Similarly, neither East Berlin nor West Berlin regarded their half as a priority area for redevelopment, seeking instead to distance themselves from the traditional heart of the city and develop two new centres for themselves, well away from the troubled border zone. West Berlin inevitably chose the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm and the area around the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, while East Berlin built up Alexanderplatz and turned Frankfurter Allee (which they renamed Stalinallee in 1949, Karl-Marx-Allee in 1961), into their own showpiece boulevard. Potsdamer Platz, meanwhile, was more or less left to rot, as one by one the ruined buildings were cleared away, neither side having the will to repair or replace them. On the western side things did improve later on with the development of the Cultural Forum, whose site roughly equates with the former Millionaires' Quarter.\n\n\n== The Berlin Wall ==\n\nWith the construction of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961, along the intracity frontier, Potsdamer Platz now found itself physically divided in two. What had once been a busy intersection had become totally desolate. With the clearance of most of the remaining bomb-damaged buildings on both sides (on the eastern side, this was done chiefly to give border guards a clear view of would-be escapees and an uninterrupted line of fire), little was left in an area of dozens of hectares. Further demolitions occurred up until 1976 when the Haus Vaterland finally disappeared. After that, only two buildings in the immediate vicinity of Potsdamer Platz still stood \u2013 one complete, the other in a half-ruined fragmented form: the Weinhaus Huth's steel skeleton had enabled the building to withstand the pounding of World War II virtually undamaged, and it stood out starkly amid a great levelled wasteland, although now occupied only by groups of squatters. A short distance away stood portions of the former Hotel Esplanade, including the Kaisersaal, used at various times as a much scaled-down hotel, cinema, nightclub and occasional film-set (scenes from Cabaret were shot there). Apart from these, no other buildings remained. Below ground, the U-Bahn section through Potsdamer Platz had closed entirely; although the S-Bahn line itself remained open, it suffered from a quirk of geography in that it briefly passed through East German territory en route from one part of West Berlin to another. Consequently, Potsdamer Platz S-Bahn station became the most infamous of several Geisterbahnhofe (ghost stations), through which trains ran without stopping, its previously bustling platforms now decrepit, sealed off from the outside world, and patrolled by armed guards.\n\nDuring its 28 years in limbo, Potsdamer Platz exuded a strange fascination towards many people on the western side, especially tourists and also visiting politicians and heads of state. For the benefit of the former, the row of post-war single-storey shops in Potsdamer Stra\u00dfe now sold a wide variety of souvenir goods, many of which were purchased by coach-loads of curious visitors brought specially to this sad location. An observation platform had been erected, primarily for military personnel and police but used increasingly by members of the public, so that they could gaze over the Wall at the wilderness beyond. Meanwhile, among the many V.I.P.s who came to look were U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy (22 February 1962), Prime Minister Harold Wilson of the United Kingdom (6 March 1965), H.M. Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom (27 May 1965), H.R.H. Charles, Prince of Wales (3 November 1972), U.S. President Jimmy Carter (15 July 1978), and U.S. Vice President (later President) George H. W. Bush (George Bush Senior) (1 February 1983).\nSome scenes of the 1987 Wim Wenders movie Der Himmel \u00fcber Berlin (English title: Wings of Desire) were filmed on the old, almost entirely void Potsdamer Platz before the Berlin Wall fell. In one scene an old man named Homer, played by actor Curt Bois, searches in vain for Potsdamer Platz, but finds only rubble, weeds and the graffiti-covered Berlin Wall. The movie thus gives a good impression of the surroundings at the time, which are completely unlike what can be seen today.\n\n\n== The fall of the Wall ==\n\n\n=== New Functions for the Platz ===\nAfter the initial opening of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989, Potsdamer Platz became one of the earliest locations where the Wall was \"breached\" to create a new border crossing between East and West Berlin. The crossing began operating on 11 November 1989, earlier than the iconic Brandenburg Gate crossing which opened more than a month later.\nThe crossing required the dismantling of both the inner and outer walls and the clearance of the death zone or no man's land between the two. A temporary road, lined with barriers, was created across this zone and checkpoints were set up just inside East German territory. Proper dismantling of the entire wall began on 15 May 1990 and all border checks were abolished on 1 July 1990 as East Germany joined West Germany in a currency union.\n\n\n=== Roger Waters' The Wall concert ===\n\nOn 21 July 1990, ex-Pink Floyd member Roger Waters staged a gigantic charity concert of his former band's rock extravaganza The Wall to commemorate the end of the division between East and West Germany. The concert took place at Potsdamer Platz \u2013 specifically an area of the former no man's land just to the north of the Reich Chancellery site, and featured many guest superstars. It was preparations for this concert, rather than historical interest, that brought about the first detailed post-Cold War survey of the area with a view to determining what, if anything, was left of Hitler's bunker and any other underground installations. Although sections of the main F\u00fchrerbunker were found, partially destroyed or filled in, another bunker complex was found further north that even the East German authorities had apparently missed, plus other cavities beneath land bordering the east side of Ebertstra\u00dfe, although these turned out to be underground garages belonging to a former SS accommodation block.\n\n\n=== Newer buildings ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Europe's largest building site ==\nAfter 1990, the square became the focus of attention again, as a large (some 60 hectares), attractive location which had suddenly become available in the centre of a major European city. It was widely seen as one of the hottest, most exciting building sites in Europe, and the subject of much debate amongst architects and planners. If Berlin needed to re-establish itself on the world stage, then Potsdamer Platz was one of the key areas where the city had an opportunity to express itself. More than just a building site, Potsdamer Platz was a statement of intent. In particular, due to its location straddling the erstwhile border between east and west, it was widely perceived as a \"linking element,\" reconnecting the two-halves of the city in a way that was symbolic as well as physical, helping to heal the historical wounds by providing an exciting new mecca attracting Berliners from both sides of the former divide. Whether fairly or unfairly, a great deal was riding on the project, and expectations were high.\nThe Berlin Senate (city government) organised a design competition for the redevelopment of Potsdamer Platz and much of the surrounding area. Eventually attracting 17 entrants, a winning design was announced in October 1991, that from the Munich-based architectural firm of Hilmer & Sattler. They had to fight off some stiff competition though, including a last-minute entry by British architect Richard Rogers.\nThe Berlin Senate then chose to divide the area into four parts, each to be sold to a commercial investor, who then planned new construction according to Hilmer & Sattler's masterplan. During the building phase Potsdamer Platz was the largest building site in Europe. While the resulting development is impressive in its scale and confidence, the quality of its architecture has been praised and criticised in almost equal measure.\n\n\n=== Daimler ===\n\nThe largest of the four parts went to Daimler-Benz (later Daimler-Chrysler and now Daimler AG), who charged Italian architect Renzo Piano with creating an overall design for their scheme while sticking to the underlying requirements of Hilmer & Sattler's masterplan. A major development bordering the west side of the former Potsdamer Bahnhof site, some of its 19 individual buildings were then erected by other architects, who submitted their own designs while maintaining Piano's key elements. One of these was Richard Rogers, who played a part in the development after all (his great British rival, Norman Foster, was putting the new dome on the Reichstag at about the same time).\nThe first spade at the start of the Daimler-Benz development was turned by the Mayor of Berlin, Eberhard Diepgen, on 11 October 1993, and the finished complex was officially opened by the Federal President of Germany, Roman Herzog, on 2 October 1998, in a glittering ceremony featuring large-scale celebrations and musical performances.\nThe 19 buildings include the offices of Daimler-Benz themselves (actually their subsidiary debis, whose 21-storey main tower rises to 106 metres and is the tallest building in the new Potsdamer Platz development), also offices of the major British professional services company PricewaterhouseCoopers, Berliner Volksbank (Germany's largest cooperative bank), and the remarkable 25-storey, 103-metre-high Potsdamer Platz No. 1, known as the Kollhoff Tower by architect Hans Kollhoff, home to a number of prestigious law firms. Potsdamer Platz No. 1 also houses the \"Panoramapunkt\" viewing platform, located 100 m above ground level, which is accessed by riding Europe's fastest elevator (8.65 metres per second). From the Panoramapunkt one can see such landmarks as the Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag, Federal Chancellery, Bellevue Palace, Cathedral, Television Tower, Gendarmes Market, Holocaust Memorial and Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. Unfortunately the Kollhoff Tower's facade needed major repairs due to water penetration and frost damage just seven years after completion, and was under scaffolding for many months.\nThe Daimler complex also contains the former Weinhaus Huth, now restored to its former glory and occupied by a restaurant, caf\u00e9, and Daimler AG's own art gallery (\"Daimler Contemporary\").\n\n\n=== Sony ===\nThe second largest part went to Sony, who erected their new European headquarters on a triangular site immediately to the north of Daimler-Benz and separated from it by the re-routed Potsdamer Stra\u00dfe. This new Sony Centre, designed by Helmut Jahn, is an eye-catching monolith of glass and steel featuring an enormous tent-like conical roof, its shape reportedly inspired by Mount Fuji in Japan, covering an elliptical central public space up to 102 metres across, and thus differing substantially from Hilmer & Sattler's original plan for the site. Its 26-storey, 103-metre-high \"Bahn Tower\" is so named because it houses the corporate headquarters of Deutsche Bahn AG, the German state railway system.\nSurviving parts of the former Hotel Esplanade have been incorporated into the north side of the Sony development, including the Kaisersaal which, in a complex and costly operation in March 1996, was moved in one piece (all 1,300 tonnes of it), some 75 metres from its former location, to the spot that it occupies today (it even had to make two right-angled turns during the journey, while maintaining its own orientation). Nearby is a new Caf\u00e9 Josty, opened early in 2001, while between the two is \"Josty's Bar,\" which is housed in the Esplanade's former breakfast room. This, like the Kaisersaal, had to be relocated, but here the room was dismantled into some 500 pieces to be reassembled where it stands now.\nTopped out on 2 September 1998, the Sony Centre was formally opened on 14 June 2000 (although many of its public attractions had been up and running since 20 January), in another grand ceremony with more music \u2013 this time with Sony's Japanese chairman Norio Ohga himself conducting the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. A keen lover of classical music, he had helped to choose the site because of its close proximity to the orchestra's home in the Cultural Forum.\n\n\n=== Beisheim ===\nThe third part became the Beisheim Center and adjoining buildings, on another triangular site bordered on the east side by Ebertstra\u00dfe, financed entirely out of his own pocket by the German businessman Otto Beisheim, the founder of the diversified retail and wholesale/cash and carry group Metro AG, based in Germany but with operations throughout Europe and in many other countries around the world.\n\n\n=== Park Kolonnaden ===\nThe fourth part is the Park Kolonnaden, a range of buildings running down the east side of the Potsdamer Bahnhof site, parallelling Daimler-Benz. This complex occupies the site of the former Haus Vaterland, and its principal building, which for a few years was the headquarters of the large German trade union ver.di (Vereinte Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft, meaning United Services Union), rises to 45 metres and has a curving glass facade designed to evoke the shape of that erstwhile landmark.\n\n\n=== Leipziger Platz ===\n\nOther developments, more piecemeal in nature, have recreated the octagonal layout of neighbouring Leipziger Platz immediately to the east. One of these is Kanada Haus, the new Embassy of Canada, on the platz's north-west diagonal. Its turf-cutting ceremony was carried out on 18 February 2002 by the Canadian Prime Minister, Jean Chr\u00e9tien, and it was officially opened on 29 April 2005.\n\n\n=== Controversy ===\nThe whole project was subject to much controversy from the start; not everyone approves of how the district was commercialised and replanned. The decision by the Berlin Senate to divide the land between just four investors \u2013 while numerous others had submitted bids \u2013 provoked scepticism. The remarkably low price Daimler-Benz paid to secure their plot prompted questions from the Berlin Auditor-General's office and the European Union in Brussels, which resulted in Daimler-Benz being billed an additional sum. There were wrangles over land-usage: although a central feature of the Daimler-Benz development is a top shopping mall \u2013 the Arkaden (Arcades), this did not form part of the plans until the Berlin Senate belatedly insisted that a shopping mall be included. Despite its undoubted success, this in turn led to what many saw as an \"Americanisation\" of the area, with even its private security force being kitted out in something resembling New York Police uniforms.\nFurther wrangles effectively brought work on the north side of Leipziger Platz to a complete stop for several years; even now there are some \"fake facades\" where completed new buildings should be, while a long-running dispute over who owned the Wertheim department store site (or had claims to the revenue from its sale by the government), left another large gap in the central Berlin cityscape that is only now finally being redeveloped. This development, known as Leipziger Platz 12, is a large complex with facades in three streets (Leipziger Stra\u00dfe, Wilhelmstra\u00dfe and Vossstra\u00dfe) as well as Leipziger Platz itself, and when completed will contain 270 stores, 270 apartments, a hotel, a fitness centre and offices. However, this development brought about the demise (after several stays of execution), of the legendary Tresor nightclub and centre for techno music. Founded on 8 March 1991 in the basement strongrooms of the former Wertheim store's bank, these having survived the decades largely undamaged, the club finally closed on 16 April 2005 (it later reopened on 24 May 2007 in a renovated power plant on K\u00f6penicker Stra\u00dfe).\nIn spite of the controversy, the rebuilt Potsdamer Platz now attracts around 70,000 visitors a day, rising to 100,000 at weekends, and some critics have been surprised by the success of the new quarter. Fears that the streets would be dead after 6 pm have proven false. At almost any time of the day, the place is alive with people. It is a particularly popular attraction for visitors: the \"Arkaden\" shopping mall is 180 metres in length and contains 133 shops and restaurants on three levels giving a total sales floor area of approx. 40,000 square metres, the lowest (basement) level being a food floor; there are also four major hotels, and Europe's largest casino (the \"Spielbank Berlin\").\nIt was also very popular with film fans, as it had three cinemas with nearly 30 screens, including an IMAX screen, showing many films in their original versions (especially English-language films), plus a film academy and a film museum. Since 1 January 2020, the cinema previously owned by CineStar has been closed (including the IMAX screen). There is also a 1,750-seater theatre, the \"Theater am Potsdamer Platz,\" which doubles up as another cinema (the \"Berlinale Palast\") for two weeks during the Berlin International Film Festival and serves as the principal venue of the festival. This venue sits above a popular night-spot: the \"Adagio Nightlife,\" located entirely underground.\nAfter major refurbishment, the S-Bahn line and station reopened on 1 March 1992, followed by the U-Bahn on 13 November 1993. An additional station on the U-Bahn, called Mendelssohn-Bartholdy-Park, was opened immediately north of the Landwehrkanal on 1 October 1998. A new U-Bahn station has also been built at Potsdamer Platz itself, although a decision is still pending on whether to proceed with completion of the line passing through it; in the meantime the station area serves as an impromptu art gallery and exhibition space. A new underground main-line station or Regionalbahnhof (Bahnhof Potsdamer Platz) has also been constructed, opened on 26 July 2006. There are also plans to reintroduce trams to Potsdamer Platz. In addition, many bus routes pass through the platz, while for people with their own cars there are some 5,000 parking spaces, 3,500 of which are underground.\nThe annual Berlin Marathon, which takes place in the last weekend of September, was first held in 1974 but due to the division of the city was confined to West Berlin up till and including 1989. Beginning in 1990 the course was re-routed into part of East Berlin, and in 2001 a further adjustment meant that the course has since run through Potsdamer Platz. Typically the leaders will pass through the platz about ten minutes before they cross the finish line.\nAnother annual tradition that began in West Berlin (in 1952) and was re-routed into the east via Potsdamer Platz following German reunification is the Weihnachtszug (Christmas train). It now does a regular two-hour round trip at weekends in the run-up to Christmas for families with children, starting and finishing at the Potsdamer Platz S-Bahn station. It did not run in 2009 or 2010 due to equipment problems, but is expected to be operational again in 2011.\nOn 2 March 2008, a statue by the Berlin artist Alexander Polzin dedicated to Italian philosopher, priest, cosmologist, and occultist Giordano Bruno (1548\u20131600), was erected inside one of the entrances to the Potsdamer Platz Regionalbahnhof.\n\n\n== Memories ==\nThe former Weinhaus Huth in the Potsdamer Platz quarter has become a restaurant and has been integrated into the new overall complex.\nThe remains of the old Hotel Esplanade have been incorporated into the Sony Center.\nA replica of the traffic tower (the traffic light) of 1924 was erected after 1990 at Potsdamer Platz.\nThe markings are reminiscent of the Berlin Wall on Potsdamer Platz and thus of the division of Berlin by paving stones in the pavement, by notches in the pedestrian area of the square and a newly erected in the 21st century stele.\nAt the south exit of the subway station Potsdamer Platz stands the pedestal for a planned in the GDR Karl Liebknecht monument, which was unveiled on 13 August 1951. The monument was never executed. The pedestal was in the \"death strip\" after the construction of the wall and was therefore not accessible. In March 1995 he was dismantled and exhibited in the Lapidarium Berlin-Kreuzberg. In November 2003 he was re-erected.\nThe eventful history of Potsdamer Platz has been digitally experienceable on site since the 2010s. The visitor has QR code with smartphone free access to panoramic images of the past decades. Depending on the viewing direction, the image moves with you, so that a comparison between today and earlier is possible\n\n\n== Future ==\n\nWhilst on the surface the new Potsdamer Platz appears so far to have lived up to its expectations as a futuristic centre of commerce at the heart of Europe's youngest capital city, there has been much debate as to just how successful it really is. Certainly its long term success and viability have become much harder to judge since the recent worldwide economic downturn, a situation compounded by the actions of its two principal owner-occupiers. Daimler and Sony caused a major surprise on 2 October 2007 when both announced that they were putting their respective complexes at Potsdamer Platz on the market. Whilst neither intended to move out, both felt it preferable to rent the space from new owners rather than continue to be the owners themselves (and so be responsible for the buildings' upkeep and maintenance). Daimler had recently come through a painful separation from their former American subsidiary Chrysler and needed a quick injection of cash in order to refocus on automotive production. The announcement came on the ninth anniversary of their complex's official opening, a fact not lost on many people. Sony meanwhile, put their decision down to a need to review their global strategy in the face of a fast-changing worldwide economic climate. The implications for Potsdamer Platz were ominous, with suggestions that overall confidence in the project was faltering, and more pessimistic claims that the development had largely failed in its original intentions.On 17 December 2007, Daimler announced that they were selling their entire complex of 19 buildings at Potsdamer Platz to SEB Asset Management, a Frankfurt-based subsidiary of the Swedish banking group SEB. On 28 February 2008, Sony made a similar announcement, of impending sale to a consortium led by American investment banking giant (now bank holding company) Morgan Stanley. Both deals were finalised by the end of March 2008. Whilst the amounts involved have not been publicly disclosed, it is believed that neither Daimler nor Sony recouped all of their original investments (what Daimler managed to get was reportedly well short). The long-term benefits (or otherwise) of these sales, remain to be seen, but whilst they may have baffled many people at the time, they may turn out to have been a shrewd move, as Daimler and Sony have avoided being saddled with something they might have found much harder to sell at a later date, just when they needed the cash the most.\nIt is unarguable that the development is a considerable commercial success at street level. The numbers of shoppers visiting the Arkaden, guests passing through the doors of the many bars, cafes and restaurants, theatres and cinemas, hotels and casino (not to mention passengers thronging the platforms of the stations), all point to a thriving focal point right at the very heart of Berlin. Detractors however, may draw attention to the floors above and point out the high percentage of office and residential space that allegedly still stands empty more than a decade after its completion. Although examples of \"over-provision\" like this can be found all over Berlin, it is Potsdamer Platz that, rightly or wrongly, has been used to highlight the problem.\nThe other major sticking point, which is reportedly causing concern at government level, is that the majority of people going to Potsdamer Platz are visitors to the city, implying that the original vision of the development as a linking element attracting Berliners themselves, and Berliners from both sides of the former divide, has not really materialised. There are criticisms that the development does not sit easily with or connect with its surroundings, and as a result Berliners have had difficulty accepting it as theirs (despite the fact that the choice of Hilmer & Sattler's masterplan was partly because it was the only one to address the way the development juxtaposed with the Cultural Forum immediately to the west, although the Cultural Forum has itself faced similar criticisms of its own). Another, more psychological factor that has played a part here is that a long-standing mutual distrust or antipathy felt between former East Berliners and West Berliners (Ossis and Wessis according to the well-known slang terms), is still very much in evidence in the city and elsewhere in Germany, and bold civil engineering projects and architectural statements are not going to make it go away by themselves. Politicians past and present have been accused of short-sightedness in speculating that they would.\nIt was feared that the economic downturn might exacerbate all these problems. On the whole, however, Potsdamer Platz seems to have weathered the storm. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bahn AG were due to relocate to a purpose-built new structure at Berlin's new main train station (Berlin Hauptbahnhof), when the lease on the Sony Center's Bahn Tower expired in 2010. However, in April 2008 Deutsche Bahn announced that they were seeking to extend the lease on the Bahn Tower by another three years. This deal was finalised in late 2009.  Since then the lease has been extended to 15 years.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nBefore World War II, Potsdamer Platz had much streetcar traffic. The last remnants were removed in 1991.\nUnlike, for example, Friedrichstra\u00dfe station, Potsdamer Platz is not a really important intersection point for the U and S-Bahn system. However, due to its location on the north-south route to the main station, parallel to the aboveground buildings, it was also connected to the regional traffic with a tunnel station. Regional trains of the DB and the ODEG, the S-Bahn (north-south tunnel) and the U2 underground line currently stop at Potsdamer Platz regional train station. Via numerous bus lines, the course can also be reached. In the medium term, a tram connection through the Leipziger Stra\u00dfe is planned, which can be supplemented or even replaced by the long-planned U3 underground line. In the north-south direction, another S-Bahn line (planning name: S21), in particular for better public transport development of the main station, to be built in the long term.\nEssentially, four major roads, in the east-west direction, Potsdamer Stra\u00dfe and Leipziger Stra\u00dfe, and in the north-south direction, Ebertstra\u00dfe and Stresemannstra\u00dfe, lead the motorized individual traffic to Potsdamer Platz. Smaller streets within the individual quarters provide for the connection of the underground parking garages. In addition, in 2006, a connection between the Uferstra\u00dfe on the Landwehrkanal and the main tunnel was put into operation, the Tunnel Tiergarten Spreebogen is part of the Bundesstra\u00dfe 96.\n\n\n== Photos, 1975\u20131989 ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nTony le Tissier: Berlin Then and Now, 1992, After the Battle Publishers, ISBN 0-900913-72-X\nPeter Fritzsche, Karen Hewitt: Berlinwalks, 1994, Boxtree Limited Publishers, ISBN 0-7522-1602-3\nJack Holland, John Gawthrop: Berlin \u2013 The Rough Guide, 1995, Rough Guides Limited Publishers, ISBN 1-85828-129-6\nUlrike Plewina, Horst Mauter, Laszlo F.

        "wiki": "The New Palace (German: Neues Palais) is a palace situated on the western side of the Sanssouci park in Potsdam, Germany. The building was begun in 1763, after the end of the Seven Years' War, under King Friedrich II (Frederick the Great) and was completed in 1769. It is considered to be the last great Prussian Baroque palace.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe building of the palace commenced at the end of the Seven Years' War, to celebrate Prussia\u2019s success. The war is also variably referred to as the Third Silesian War, owing to the dispute over Silesia. In an architectural form, Frederick the Great sought to demonstrate the power and glories of Prussia attributing it as fanfaronade, an excess of splendor in marble, stone and gilt.\nFor the King, the New Palace was not a principal residence, but a display for the reception of important royals and dignitaries. Of the over 200 rooms, four principal gathering rooms and a theater were available for royal functions, balls and state occasions. During his occasional stays at the palace, Frederick occupied a suite of rooms at the southern end of the building, composed of two antechambers, a study, a concert room, a dining salon and a bedroom, among others.\nAfter the death of Frederick the Great in 1786, the New Palace fell into disuse and was rarely occupied as a residence or entertainment venue. However, starting in 1859 it became the summer residence of the German Crown Prince, Frederick William, later German Emperor Frederick III. The palace was the preferred residence of Frederick and his empress, Victoria, throughout the 99 Days\u2019 Reign. During the short reign of Frederick III, the palace was renamed \"Friedrichskron Palace\" (Schloss Friedrichskron) and a moat was dug around the palace. The accession of Wilhelm II saw renovation and restoration within the palace being carried out with the installation of steam heating, bathrooms in state apartments and electrification of the chandeliers which Frederick the Great had collected from across Europe. Until 1918, it remained the preferred residence of Wilhelm II and the Empress Augusta.\nAfter the November Revolution and the abdication of Wilhelm II, the New Palace became a museum and remained such until the Second World War. Some of the palace\u2019s treasures were looted by Soviet Army at the end of the war. Much of its furniture had been removed and taken to the residence of the exiled Wilhelm II at Huis Doorn in the Netherlands. The majority of the furnishings were discovered by the Dutch in the 1970s, still in their original packing crates, and returned to Potsdam. Because of this, and because it escaped bombing in the Second World War, the palace today looks much as it did in 1918.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nWhile Frederician Rococo was established at Sanssouci, Frederick the Great had the New Palace built in varying forms of Baroque architecture and decoration, with some deviations. The King preferred Rococo and Baroque to the Neoclassical style that was already taking hold of Europe at the time as the preference of many monarchs. Architect Johann Gottfried B\u00fcring, with the aid of Heinrich Ludwig Manger (de), was assigned with the task of planning the New Palace and had already demonstrated success with the completion of the Chinese Teahouse and the Picture Gallery in the Sanssouci royal park.\nAfter disagreements over the design of the palace, in 1764 the design of the palace was totally vested in the architect Carl von Gontard. The three-story fa\u00e7ade had already begun to rise around unfinished interiors, as construction had steadily been underway. With 220 metre east and west fa\u00e7ades, the centre portion of the palace was crowned with an enormous dome, at the top of which were placed the Three Graces supporting the Prussian royal crown. The dome is not only architectural, it provides an attic area under the supporting timbers which carry it. Additionally, the north and south auxiliary wings are crowned with domes surmounted by gilded eagles. Between the pilasters, what appears to be brick is actually a painted effect, leaving only the King\u2019s south wing with exposed brick. Repointing the mortar of the joints proved to be an arduous and expensive task, therefore Frederick had the brick covered in stucco and painted in such a way that even tourists today are fooled by the deceptive finish. Over 400 sandstone statues and figures adorn the palace and auxiliary buildings, created by many notable sculptors, namely Johann Peter Benckert, Johann Matthias Gottlieb Heym\u00fcller, the brothers Johann David and Johann Lorenz R\u00e4ntz and others.\n\n\n== Interiors ==\nIn addition to the royal apartments, four grand staterooms (festival halls) occupy the central portion of the palace. On the ground floor is the Grotto Hall, attributed to Carl von Gontard, with walls encrusted with shells, stones, marble, quartz and semi-precious stones, which were enriched in the 19th century. Part of the design of the Groto Hall is a marble floor depicting marine animals and plants and an 1806 ceiling painting, Venus and Amor, the Three Graces and Putti. Attributed to Johann Gottfried Niedlich, the painting has replaced an earlier work. Niches around the room contain statuary and fountains, with cut crystal chandeliers hung in the arches.\nThe southern Marble Gallery, on the ground floor, leads to the apartments of the King. Decorated in white marble and red jasper, it is one of the most important examples of rococo decoration within the palace. Six windows are set opposite to mirrored niches, which reflect light throughout the room. Three large crystal chandeliers are suspended from a heavily gilt ceiling bearing three large paintings; Night, Morning and Midday by the artist Bernhard Rode. 18th-century chairs upholstered in leather, vases of faux Egyptian porphyry and console tables furnish the gallery.\nSituated directly over the Grotto Hall is the Marble Hall, the largest of the festival halls, which was used variously as a ballroom and as a banqueting hall. Rising over two floors, the hall overlooks the eastern parterres and the axial vista leading to Sanssouci. The richly gilt, curved ceiling rises into the attic area under the great copper dome. The painting in the center of this ceiling, The Induction of Ganymede in Olympus, was created in 1769 by Charles-Am\u00e9d\u00e9e-Philippe van Loo. With a surface of 240 square meters, it is the largest canvas ceiling painting north of the Alps.  Four enormous paintings commissioned before the Seven Years' War adorn the marble walls of the hall. Positioned at the pilasters are twelve statues, depicting eight Brandenburg Prince-electors and four famous \"emperors\": Julius Caesar, Constantine, Charlemagne and Rudolph II. A balcony with an intricate gilt iron railing overlooks the hall from the third floor.\nThe Upper Gallery within the palace is situated to the south of the Marble Hall and is directly above the Marble Gallery on the ground floor. The ceiling is painted in hues of rose, antique yellow and white, accented with heavy gilt ornamentation. The ever-popular Neoclassicism of Europe at the time can be seen in the roundels positioned above and on the doors. Six large Italian Baroque paintings hang opposite the windows of the gallery. All that remains of the original furnishings are three marble mosaic console tables and upholstered settees.\nAfter the revolution of 1918, which overthrew the monarchy, the Weimar Republic allowed 34 train wagons of furniture from the palace to be sent to the exiled Wilhelm II at Huis Doorn in the Netherlands. This is the reason why the furniture in the upper rooms formerly lived in by Wilhelm II and his consort Empress Augusta Viktoria comes from elsewhere.\n\n\n== Theatre ==\n\nOccupying two levels above the ground floor, the theatre dates to the Frederick the Great\u2019s reign in the 18th century and is still in use today. Rococo in style, the theatre makes heavy use of red and white with gilded accents. It can be seen as peculiar given its location within a palace, for the theatre lacks a royal box in which a king may view a performance. Instead, Frederick would sit among his guests in the third row of seating from the stage. The seat rows, which are curved, are reminiscent of an amphitheatre in antiquity. The theatre is fitted with modern stage equipment which is discreetly placed to preserve the Rococo d\u00e9cor.\n\n\n== Communs ==\n\nOpposite to the palace\u2019s westward-opening court of honour are the Communs, designed by Carl von Gontard and Jean Laurent Le Geay. Styled in the same manner as the palace itself, the two buildings housed the royal kitchens, utilities, gardeners\u2019 shops, palace guards and servants. Between the two buildings stretches a curved colonnade, decorated with statuary and obelisks, which acted as a state entrance and as a screen to shield the view of the marshlands beyond. In 1896, Wilhelm II had a tunnel constructed to allow passage between the palace and the Communs, avoiding possibly inclement weather. The curved staircases, domes, pilasters and columns do not show the practical purpose of the buildings. Today, the buildings are used by the University of Potsdam and are undergoing restoration although a lack of funding has pushed the date of completion to 2016. The 29-acre parcel has been closed off to the public and is no longer viewable by tourists.\n\n\n== Park ==\nThe New Palace, lying at the western end of the Sanssouci royal park, is located on a main axial avenue. At the time of its construction, the palace was located in an expansive baroque park area. Today, the area of the palace park within proximity to the New Palace is laid out simply with pathways, statuary, fountains and greenery. Nearby are the Temple of Friendship and the Antique Temple, which like the New Palace were designed by Carl von Gontard and built shortly after its completion.\n\n\n== World Heritage Site ==\nSince 1990, the New Palace has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin\". The palace is administered by the Stiftung Preu\u00dfische Schl\u00f6sser und G\u00e4rten Berlin-Brandenburg. \n\n\n== See also ==\nList of castles in Berlin and Brandenburg\nPalaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin\nList of Baroque residences\nList of sights of Potsdam\n\n\n== References ==\nHenriette Graf: Das Neue Palais K\u00f6nig Friedrichs des Gro\u00dfen.

          "Grand, Splendid, Decadent. All set to have its king once again.",
          "This is such a nice castle and park! Go there and you will not regret. There is lots of history and interesting stories around these places. If you would walk all little roads in the park the sum would be 70 kilometers. Fun fact. Have fun while exploring it!",
          "Even though we visited this place in a gray and rainy day, the amazing architecture cheered us up! Worth the visit!",
          "Beautiful architecture,very grand. I came here 7 years ago it was closed for restoration. Come again this time, the sign said closed for restoration \ud83d\ude02. I want to see inside. Those chambers look so beautiful from the pictures. Nice walk around the palace ground though.",
          "Beautiful area with plenty of therapeutic energy. I recommend the entire park for a day trip by yourself, with a date, or picnic with friends.",
          "Really beautiful castle from outside and inside. Beware of the need to make an entrance reservation since you can only get in at a specific time due to the guided tour schedule. It is also interesting to visit the other places, gardens and parka located in the surroundings",
          "Amazing! The grounds are beautiful, there are several gardens and walking paths to walk through. Both palaces are worth seeing. I was there in winter and can only imagine how beautiful it is in the spring and summer",
          "Very original and well preserved example of baroque architecture style. Well worth the walk as other forms of transportation are restricted in the area and on the territory of the park that is actually is the part of the Palace. To visit \u2026",
          "This was a good tour. If I had to pick one palace to visit in Potsdam, this would be my choice. Be aware that if you take a tour at one of the other palaces and are hoping to make the last tour at 4pm, give yourself enough time to get there \u2026",
          "A beautiful well kept building. Very touristic because of a cluster of landmarks, it makes for an easy combined visit though (combi-tickets are sold).",
          "Nice place. Great statues and quiet. Plenty of room for kids to run but not sure it's right to do here, out of respect. Buildings from around 1737 and later. Impressive place. Id give 5 stars if there were plaques or brochure to explain what we're looking at. Nice place for a quick geocaching adventure ;)",
          "Nice place to visit. You will have opportunity to see some amazing monuments.",
          "30 Kms away from Berlin city. A beautiful small city with some amazing architects. Take 695 from Potsdam railways station to reach the palace.",
          "Potentially Interesting place that was closed\nOutside, the palace looks monumental and pretty. I am not a special lover of this style, but I openly admit that he is beautiful.\nHowever, the positive impression for me ends here, as I did not \u2026",

          "Get your walking boots on and see why Frederick was great \ud83d\ude0a",
          "I guess the experience is reasonable for the \u20ac8 entry fee. I was a little disappointed that most of the rooms were a bit empty without much furniture. I found it a bit hard to really get into the atmosphere of how people lived in the palace back then. The architecture and interiors are beautiful though and certainly very unique!",
          "The New castle is amazing!!!",
          "Amazing Prussian palace, which is indeed a UNESCO heritage site. The gardens surrounding it are beautiful and become magical in autumn, with all the shades of yellow, orange andd red. The palace itself is very peculiar and excessive (a \u2026",

          "A beautiful place, every room is made in different style, e.g. one room is decorated with thousands of seashells, other is coated with silk, but each one is breathtaking.",
          "Most of the places unaccessible in winter season and really unclear ticket system. The palace itself does make an impression although it smells funny.\n\nThe most annoying thing is that the bathrooms are extra paid. Really, I already paid 19\u20ac for entrance!",
          "Gorgeous baroque palace built by Frederick the Great in the mid-1700s",
          "A beautiful place having enough traditional things around. The entire park is full of artwork and scenery. Wherever in the park you are there is something to see. From Berlin a day or even a half day to Potsdam by train make of course the \u2026",

          "So beautiful",
          "Very well-run and carefully-maintained eighteenth-century palace complex. Only a few rooms were available to visit when we went, but that was fine as the price was adjusted accordingly (\u20ac8 pp for a visit that took us 90 minutes). The audio \u2026",
          "Not one of the better castles in the park, but  worth seeing.",
          "Great palace to visit and feel that period of German history. Palace is really big outside and very interedting inside. One room is made of sea shells which is very rare. There are two main chambers which are really beautiful. This place is PRESS friendly",
          "Amazing palace that has incredible use of wood, marble, silk and silver to create stupendous floor, wall and ceiling cover. Though much of the furniture was lost when Potsdam was under Soviet occupation, it's been lovingly restored and is a beautiful park with many other palace buildings to visit. Highly recommended.",
          "The spectacular nature of this palace is.something to behold.",
          "We entered to see it and on the outside everything very beautiful, but when we arrived at a palace and we were going back, they put some fences and they didn't let anyone pass, that was the shortest way.  They had organized and an event and \u2026",
          "An excellent palace \nVery beautiful outside and inside \nA must visit if in Berlin",
          "Good palace to visit. The Christmas hall is amazing. Audio guide was informative, they provide it in English as well.\n\nLimited number of locker, I had to put my backpack on front and it was really inconvenient.",
          "Beautiful on the outside, wasn\u2019t able to visit beacause of restricted visit time in Postdam.\nThey only had auto guided tours and and restricted times to get in.\nWent there and the only available visit was half an hour later, couldn\u2019t get in otherwise.",
          "Beautiful place to visit while in Potsdam.  There\u2019s a lot to see... be prepared to walk and visit different stunning buildings... however, be awarded that you may pay a full entrance that includes different palaces otherwise you\u2019ll end up paying around \u20ac8 every time you want to visit one of the palaces.",
          "Beautiful palace. Be aware of the fee for taking pictures. We bought one with our family ticket but it was only for one person (that was not explained). An employee inside the palace told that to us (with no English at all) which was ok but \u2026",
          "Very nice palace in Sanssouci park in Potsdam.",
          "It's absolutely beautiful and well kept. However the open area is huge and it's a long way to walk to the bus and train station as well. I went to the cafe there as well and I think it's too small and busy for such a large tourist spot. Overall the palace was great but the facilities were quite unfriendly.",
          "As someone from NYC, this park blows Central Park out of the water. The entire park is full of artwork and scenery. Wherever in the park you are there is something to see. If you're in Berlin and have a free day or even a half day to train to Potsdam it's well worth the trip.",
          "Very beautiful place! \ud83d\ude0d\nBe careful - the last ticket in inside the palace is sold at 16:45.",
          "This palace is a rococo dream!",
          "The New Palace is my favourite building in the park, it's so beautiful and enormous. There is lots of history and many stories, go explore you wound regret it!",
          "While visiting Berlin, I decided to take a tour of Frederick the Great's castle in Potsdam.  I was totally awestruck with everything I laid my eyes on from the 250 year old chandeliers to the vast ballrooms with ornate marble flooring.  I \u2026",
          "Beautiful old and magnificent building! The gardens outside are also endless. I visited in February, maybe not the best time of the year. It will better during spring time when everything revives and goes green. I recommend!",
          "Audio Guide was good with more depth available. Ticket office placed too far from entrance for some elderly visitors. Palais and its history was extremely interesting.",
          "This place is huge. I recommend renting a bike for this tour.",
          "Simply magnificent palace at Sanssouci park, Potsdam. It's a Baroque/Rococo style palace, constructed 1763 & completed 1769 for Frederick the Great. There are 4 grand staterooms (or festival halls) in addition to the Royal apartments. The \u2026",
          "Definitely a must while you are in Potsdam. This palace is huge so bring comfortable shoes to walk all around the place. Access to the palace area and surroundings is free. Taking a guided tour is recommended as they can explain more about the history of this place. You can easily spend an hour walking around.",
          "It's a palace like no other! Amazing works of art! Opulent beauty befitting a king. I was truly blown away by the sheer beauty of this place. That coupled with the gardens it was breathtaking. I highly recommend this as a stop through the Berlin area.",

          "One wonders... this and near by palaces the effort to build, maintain such grand and majestic looking places.  The history and people associated with such grandeur is impressive. Again well worth making this one or two day trip from Berlin. \u2026",
          "A complex of palaces and castles, it's beautiful and the park around it's amazing. There is no entry to the palace, so the view is only outside so far I know. Great experience",

          "Giants palaces here and big square between them. Very impressed.",

          "We never went inside the palace but the outside and the park were absolutely beautiful!",
          "Incredible nice place but gardens are not well keep",
          "Not bad the life of the kingy",
          "Very cold during the winter and really suggest you just enjoy the view and take pictures outside as inside can be boring for people not interested in arts and paintings.",
          "It\u2019s a good palace and worth a visit. Unless you live in a palace in which case it\u2019s another palace. The \u2018service\u2019 buildings are rather grand too! The University building is also very grand - all within the same area ... like a cluster of palaces ... go see them!",
          "The Palace is nice. The tour was only in German. We expected some English human guidance, but there was not. It was very cold inside. There is no elevator for people who cannot climb stairs.",

          "This Park with all of it's palaces can get expensive, 6 Euro for the gallery, 12 Euro for the old palace, 8 Euro for the New Palace, 3,00 Euro to take pictures at each place, though, you might be able to buy one wrist band and take pictures \u2026",
          "This place is so huge and beautiful. A worth one - two day visit (Palace and Park). A tour in the Palace is about one hour.\nAnd it can be reached with a 40 min train ride from Berlin. Also Same public ticket (ABC zone) is valid in Potsdam.",
          "Wow , this place is amazing and highly recommended to visit",
          "Palace itself is great. I had a combi ticket and at the entrance of the New Palace was sent to the cash desk to get an additional separate ticket. If such additional ticket was needed, why it was not given to me at the cash desk where I \u2026",

          "This place os big and well maintained. Lots to see and the voice guide has a fairly good balance between being not overly long and informative enough. Imho better than the nearby Sanssouci, but they are different and both worth seeing.",

          "Definitely worth visiting for short day trip. Plan carefully because the walk through the park from Potsdam to the palace is very long. Potsdam's size is deceptive. For a first time visitor, the city is much bigger than when you see it \u2026",
          "Beautiful and imposing structure",
          "Not well maintained. On an University campus. Its ok but not an \"need to see place in my opinion",

          "Really impressed by some of the rooms here.",
          "Lovely historic building make sure you pay for the tour guide as there is something history to listen to in every ornate room. The only downside is that lockers have to be used foe bags and cameras.Although you can buy a licence for a camera but don't use the flash as there are wardens everywhere.",
          "A great place to visit especially in the spring. Go prepared with comfy shoes and a water bottle.",

          "A lot of people coming by the park/garden side saw only the back and not the front! The main entrance is on the other side!!! Buy the audio-guided tour tixs from a small visitor centre on the left, the interior of the Palace is really \u2026",

          "Beautiful place and amazingly restored.  Would always recommend an audio guide due to the many very interesting infos",
          "It is a must to see when you visit Postdam. Go to schlo\u00df Sanssouci",
          "Worth a visit to see the architecture but devoid of historical furnishings",
          "It is definitely worth it to go inside to see those astounishing interiors.",
          "This place has 2 rooms that definitely should be visited. But it is possible only during regular tour.",
          "A very interesting tour where you get to see huge halls with quite extravagant decoration. Definitely worth the visit.",
          "Impressive buildings, far too many statues on them. The park walk was lovely though.",
          "An incredible palace. It\u2019s not open fully to the public. It\u2019s still stand more than 250 years. Qaisar Wilhelm the last Qaisar took 36 carriages from this palace and went to exile. Not all furniture available there.",
          "Even though they claim to work until six, we were not able to finish the exhibition. It was unclear where to go, so we missed few halls. We ended up at the end of tour, wanted to go back to see what we have missed, but where not allowed. It was 5PM. What a shame.",

          "tickets is too far away from the palace, hard to get them while its raining",
          "Next to Park Sanssouci, this is a beautiful area to take a walk or ride bike during summer. You can visit not only Neues Palais, but also many other palaces in the surroundings.

          "More than Sanssouci this palace gives an idea how the Kaiser and family lived til the beginning of modern times: first bathrooms, first electricity, central heating. See how they wanted to impress the world with abundance of space, rooms, statues, etc. At the same time how",
          "It's a very long hike from Sanssouci but you have to see this Palace. This is where the grand parties and functions took place and thus you have huge ballrooms etc. the Marble room is amazing. As noted you have to check in at the gift shop first to get entry time but many fewer",
          "Got to pretty much have this palace to myself, which was fantastic and it felt like a less of a conveyor belt than Sanssoucci. Would recommend doing this in the morning after picking up your tickets.",

          "This was supposed to be only a summer palace. But its grandeur is breathtaking. The intricate design for the various rooms as well as the meticulous execution are hard to find today. Everything inside -- wall covering, chandeliers, furniture, flooring -- is almost from",
          "We found the neues palais quite underwhelming in comparison to Sansoucci Palace. Although the rooms were grander and more intricately decorated, they didn't have the flair and style of Sansoucci. The audio guide wasn't as informative about the context of the palace as",
          "We did not visit inside due to time limitations, but the outside is very impressive, including the symmetric buildings of the Potsdam university, offering some surreal views for photography. At the other side of the park, there is a bus that will take you to back to the the",
          "OMG this Palace is breathtaking. Most of the rooms are incredible but the Marble room on the 2nd floor is something quite special. If you have time you need to allow a complete day to view the \"New Palace\", the gardens and San Souci. That said, I have two issues - one - the",
          "It was amazing to see that some buildings that were built with the palace are now part of the Potsdam University. There were more rooms that are open to visitors than Sansoucci Palace and the marble room and the grotto were the highlights in this palace. Don't miss this",
          "Impressive palace, build at the peak of prussian power by Frederik the great. However, some parts are still under refurbishement until 2018.",
          "The palace grounds are just incredible, and despite it is still under construction, the visit is worth the trip. Still hard to understand why this was not the emperor's favorite. Can hardly wait to see the gardens finished.",
          "Amazing visit to this Palais! Worthwhile to plan this visit in the weekend as you would get the extended tour, as on weekdays they only allow you to visit a part of it. Furthermore still a lot restauration ongoing till november 2018!",
          "Baroc style palace. Rocco style interiors. Lovely preserved, and still under restoration work. This Palace gets far less visitors than Sanssouci. 8 \u20ac, timed entry ticket, you CANNOT pre book. Audio guide included. A must see UNESCO sight.",
          "Palace was bombastic and in baroque style architecture but nothing like France. It seemed out of place and was built to be ostentatious but seemed to fail in that attempt.",
          "our tour guide provided us with so much information about the palace. a little disappointing on the inside, considering its vastness, but still a beautiful place to stroll around and visit.",
          "Shell grotto, no huge shell room. Marble floor, yes but huge! This is avast restoration project but definitely one to see. The scale of the building and project is awesome.",
          "Beautiful Palace situated in the park. Well worth the walk if you enter the park from the opposite side as the details around the palace are awesome.",
          "The view of the palace as you walk towards it from the long straight road of the gardens is stunning. However, if you go behind the front (the third picture) you're greeted by a slightly sad state of affairs, with this part of the palace in disrepair and in desperate need of",
          "Visited after touring the Sanssouci Palace where I had bought the combo ticket. Unfortunately the combo ticket only saves you 1 euro and no time, you still need to walk a km to get an appointment at the remote visitor center for the New Palace entry, very frustrating after a",
          "Normally a wonderful building well worth a visit, but unfortunately at the time of my most recent visit undergoing rennovations that prevent parts of it being viewed. However I have still given it a 5 star rating as no doubt it will be back to it wonderous splendor one it has",
          "Germany is not-lacking in castles to see, but I have to say this one is actually worth paying to enter! With breath-taking art and architecture, each room is different and amazing in its own way. The tour is an audio, self-led tour. The first room is decorated completely in",
          "We took an express train from Berlin HbH (Euro 7.5 day ticket) & the hop-on-hop-off tour bus, taking in this lovely city. Fair to say that we were not prepared for Neues Palais - we were stunned by the magnificence and splendour of this 'guest house'. The 45 minute audio tour",
          "You will never see a guesthouse like this in Europe. The New Palais was just built for guests at the Sanssouci Gardens and Castels. Now newly renovated you find the Marble saloon, the \"Grotte\" and the other rooms in perfect shape. And it is just incredible and breathtaking. So",
          "Must-see location with audio tour inside. It is recommended to listen to the whole audio tour from start to finish, as particular historical and architectural details are extremely interesting. The optimal routing throught the building is not clear upfront, and one has to",

          "This palace is absolutely beautiful. I did not have the opportunity to go inside, but the outside is absolutely gorgeous and the building facing it, which is part of the Potsdam University, is also incredible. My family and I road bicycles around Sanssouci and found this to be",
          "Wow, so much history in this 600 rooms, you cannot visit all of them but it is enough ;-). Situated in the beautiful park of Sanssouci you can walk around and enjoy the other must sees.",
          "This is very pompous building was commissioned by Fredrick the Great to demonstrate Prussian economic power.",
          "The two great halls, one above the other, are spectacular. There is a lot of restoration work going on. If possible, a trip back in ten years time to se the finished result.",
          "While you cannot see all of the palace on the tours and it clearly is in need of further repair you certainly see the splendour and will be amazed at some of the interiors. Somewhat expensive for the limited tour, but I guess they need the money for continued restoration. Will",
          "I could write pages, but shortly: in spite of the outside renovation, the palace is amazing, impressive a \"must-see\" in Potsdam. Breath-taking. You have to ask a permission time in the ticket-office, so it is not overcrowded inside, so you really can take your own time to look",
          "This is the largest palace and it has a wealth of rooms with exquisite interior decoration. The newly renovated 'grotto' is in a class of its own with shell and stone inlays on the walls. It was worth the rather long walk from Sanssouci. Bus connections here are limited.",
          "Definitely worth a trip to see, this baroque palace is off-the-charts opulent. During our trip recently, there were major renovations being done, which was a visual distraction from the outside. However, what we missed outside was made up for on the inside. One of the first",
          "We took the RE 1 train from Berlin all the way down to the last stop which made for a 10 minute walk up to this palace and I highly recommend that. You can get your ticket for both palaces at this one although San Soucci is a timed entry. Gorgeous rooms, lots of gold and really",
          "A truly wonderful place. Beautiful architecture, magnificent building, this is something not to be missed.",
          "We enjoyed walking the grounds and seeing the palace. The audioguide in my language was very helpful and have been included in the price informative. The gift shop was really nice. It costs extra to see inside a Chinese house on the property. It seems it could have been included",
          "The building is under renovation, but still open to public. You may purchase the ticket to this palace with the Sanssouci Palace at the same time, in this way you don't have to get in line once more, and the ticket print the time you can get in either building, save some time.",
          "This is the one palace in Sanssouci Park that is not to be missed. The self-guided tours are done through audio-devices and even have an audio program specifically targeted for children (which is just as informative as the \"adult\" version and definitely more entertaining!).",
          "This place is not far from the train station. We took about 15 minutes from the station by foot. When we visited, it was under reconstruction but still beautiful. It'd be more convenient if I could ride a bike to more other places around the area.",
          "Amazing that such a lovely place should not be more on the tourist routes. Very well restored so far and sure that improvements will continue.",
          "Bigger than Sanssouci palace..lovely tour. It was less crowded than Sanssouci. Best to book tickets online prior to your visit if you can!",
          "Situated in Park Sanssouci in Potsdam, palace is one of many great buildings of this town. Unfortunately one wing was closed due to restoration but I could still enter those interiors because of a tour that was organized for us (Conference participants). So we could admire the",
          "I would recommend this to other travelers who like baroque and rococo architecture. It is a large palace and takes some time to go around, however some rooms were closed for renovations and there was building work on the outside of the palace when we went.",
          "Hardly saw anything, palace was surrounded by building works and a large section inside was closed. I understand that a palace might need renovating, and that might be costly, wide ranging and time consuming, but to charge full price is absurd. I'm sure I'm not alone on",
          "This one of biggest palace in Germany, located in the area park of Sanssouci (western side ) made this palace is great to look around in any season. in winter until spring, they closed some section for maintenance. The building is great with history behind, this build after the",
          "This was the alternative we picked when we couldn't get into Sanssouci palace. It was nice enough but there was quite a bit of construction and renovation. It meant only some areas were available for touring. I'm sure once the renovations are complete (no clue when) it'll be",
          "i have recently been on tour through the Castle checking out room to room and learning the history and it was amazing with so much to see. With most of the palace in am original state it was great to see and experience. One problem was that the week day tour is not the same as",

          "The New Palace is the largest 18th century structure in the Sanssouci park. It was built from 1763 to 1769. The strangest part of the tour was the Grotto. In November, the palace was cold and damp - not very cheery.",
          "The less famous of the Potsdam Palaces may actually be the more impressive of them. Its much larger than the more famous Sansoucci palace and is beautiful as well. The quick construction and the painted brick facade is interesting.",
          "A lovely building. Public transport required to get here and you could do Sanssouci in the same afternoon. There was some building work going on here so disappointing but still a wonderful Palace.",
          "I did not go into the palace itself because it was being renovated but I did walk around the gardens. It was magnificently maintained with beautiful statutes everywhere. There are a lot of hidden surprises as well.",
          "It is surprising that this Palace is not the number 1 attraction of Potsdam. It is really big and architecture is magnificent. If you stand a the centre and take a 360 degree turn, you will get reminded of cathedral at Vatican. The ceiling is huge and one should take a",
          "What a huge beautiful building, but there were walls and scaffolding everywhere. It was truly impressive. We had a hard time finding where we were to get the time slot for this building. It is to the left behind the Neues Palace in a souvenir, cafe building. Then he have us",
          "Much of the building is still being restored to its former glory but the available rooms show that the effort is worth it. The grotto room in particular is stunning.",
          "The New Palace is the epitome of ostentation and conspicuous consumption of the Prussian royal families. The rococo style of architecture, gold painted furniture and decorations, paintings and statues of voluptuous females are a bit overwhelming, though historically",
          "Fantastic place set within Sans Souci Park and well worth a visit. Do the Potsdam bus tour and get off at park and you will enjoy a great 2 or 3 hours relaxing in a peaceful and tranquil setting.",
          "Fantastic palace.i took photographs for over 2 hours I was amazed because there are hundreds of statues and Arkitekture is just fantastic.i love this palace I Could had been there all day just sitting and watching Please visit this unbelivable palace This is like finding",
          "Taking the sightseeing bus and dropped off to this palace on my way back to the starting point. This palace is indeed a really big palace. Unfortunately we did not go inside the palace as we are in a rush to go to other places at the same route. We spent sometime to look through",
          "Although this building is undergoing much renovation with a lot of scaffolding, one cannot fail to be impressed by the scale of things. The Prussian nobility certainly knew how to do things in style. Tip:remember that even though you have bought a combined ticket for the various",
          "Neues Palais is in the process of renovation, and is still striking and a formidable powerhouse of history, art, and design. The walk to get there alone, gives a memorable presentation to one of the many worthwhile sights in Potsdam. If you have time, get lost on one the",

          "Only viewed exterior..pretty impressive.Believe replicas only in interior but certainly worth a look.",
          "The inside is quite small compared to what I expected but it was nice, short explanations in the audio guide , it was a lot of fun to spend some time there.",
          "Again, we enjoyed it with a guide, who was well-informed, passionate about the subject and made the visit so much more enjoyable. A must-see!",
          "It looks like the whole park has a bit of neglection issues. The restoration i pretty bad and for some places they put a picture of a sofa where the original was supposed to be. Other cases out of 6 chairs 1 was original and the rest looked liked a bad restoration job.",
          "As for the palace itself, it's nice to look at, but I found the tour to be quite boring. Not much history or interesting stories to it. Just an average. The most fun part was probably when they required you to put on their super giant slippers over your shoes (to protect the",

          "This is very interesting. The guide had a very good way of explaining history without it being boring. Unfortunately the two main halls (worth seeing) are under construction. Once they are finished I will visit again.",
          "Since much of the Palais is under renovation, you can only access as part of a guided tour - which means buying a ticket and reserving a slot. The commentary by the guides is average and somewhat unenthusiastic and hardly 'engaging'. And of course, if you have a weak bladder,",
          "Be very careful when booking your time slot to enter the palace! We paid for a combined ticket to Sansoussi & Neues Palace, and were booked onto the time slots recommended by the people at the ticket office at Sansoussi. This was based on the the length of the tour times and",

          "The Palais itself isn't that bad but the visits are pretty bad organised; they ony let you visit it per groups every 20mins but they put everyone together: german speaking visitors for which there is a guided tour and other languages speaking people who need an audio-guide. So",

          "Travelled to Potsdam as a side trip to Berlin in January 2011. Potsdam campus is lovely. I enjoyed walking around the Sans Souci palace but regret going inside the Neues Palais which is the only site you can visit indoors. We were traveling with a 3-year old who is not exactly",
          "This palace may not look as pretty from the outside as Sanssouci but in my view was more impressive. The inside of the palace is rocco instyle but appears much more sumptious (if that is possible!). The free audio guide made the history of this palace come alive. As this palace"

        "wiki": "Babelsberg (German: [\u02c8ba\u02d0bl\u0329s\u02ccb\u025b\u0281k] (listen)) is the largest district of Potsdam, the capital city of the German state of Brandenburg. The affluent neighbourhood named after a small hill on the Havel river is famous for Babelsberg Palace and Park, part of the Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin UNESCO World Heritage Site, as well as for Babelsberg Studio, a historical centre of the German film industry and the first large-scale movie studio of the world.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nA settlement on the small Nuthe creek was first mentioned in the 1375 Landbuch (domesday book) by Emperor Charles IV of Luxembourg, who also ruled as Margrave of Brandenburg since 1373. Then called Neuendorf (New Village) after its former West Slavic name Nova Ves, it was shelled several times and was severely damaged during the Thirty Years' War. \nIn the mid-18th century the new village of Nowawes was founded by King Frederick II of Prussia and settled with Protestant Bohemian deportees, predominantly weavers who as descendants of the Unity of the Brethren had fled from the suppression in the lands of the Habsburg Monarchy under Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. During the Industrial Revolution the area developed into a centre of textile and carpet manufacturing, and\u2014at the premises of Orenstein & Koppel, from 1899 on\u2014also of the railway production. For decades German Neuendorf and Bohemian Nowawes (Czech: Nov\u00e1 Ves) bordered on each other but remained separate municipalities until their official unification in 1907. Nowawes received town privileges in 1924.\n\nFrom about 1900 the mansion colony of Neubabelsberg arose east of Babelsberg Park on the southern shore of the Griebnitzsee lake. After the Universum Film AG (UFA) in 1922 had acquired a large backlot nearby, these villas built by famous architects like Hermann Muthesius and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe became popular residences of numerous film stars. Marika R\u00f6kk, Sybille Schmitz, Lilian Harvey, Willy Fritsch and Brigitte Horney lived and worked here when film production by the UFA continued without a break in the Nazi period, while many Jewish actors and directors were dispossessed and had to flee from Germany. In 1938 Nowawes and Neubabelsberg merged and were incorporated into Potsdam one year later, becoming the district of Potsdam-Babelsberg. \nDuring the 1945 Potsdam Conference the representatives of the victorious Allies Joseph Stalin, President Harry S. Truman and Prime Minister Winston Churchill (succeeded by Clement Attlee) resided in mansions of Neubabelsberg. At the \"Truman-Villa\" the President issued the Potsdam Declaration and gave orders for the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Today the building serves as the seat of the liberal Friedrich Naumann Foundation.\n\n\n== Babelsberg Palace ==\nIn 1833 Prince Wilhelm of Hohenzollern had obtained the consent of his father King Frederick William III of Prussia to build a summer residence for him and his spouse Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach on the slope of the Babelsberg hill, overlooking the Havel river. The first plans were designed in a Neo-Gothic style by Karl Friedrich Schinkel, but soon did not satisfy the growing demands of Wilhelm, who - as the marriage of his elder brother King Frederick William IV produced no children - meanwhile had achieved the status of Prussian crown prince. The palace was largely extended according to plans by Friedrich Ludwig Persius and finished in 1849.\nBabelsberg remained a residence of Wilhelm after his accession to the Prussian and German throne. It was here, after a private conversation on 23 September 1862 he appointed Otto von Bismarck Minister President of Prussia and decided not to abdicate.\n\n\n== Babelsberg today ==\nBecause of the closeness to Berlin and Potsdam, Babelsberg's history has much in common with its neighbours, notably the common history of Prussia, the Partition of Germany during the Cold War and German reunification. The neighbourhood shares a direct border with the Wannsee district of Berlin, where some remains of the Berlin Wall survive. \n\nStudio Babelsberg is widely known as a European media centre and the oldest large-scale film studio in the world. It is also one of the two seats of the public Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg (rbb) broadcaster and home of the German Broadcasting Archive.\nSince 1990 Babelsberg Palace with the surrounding park laid out by Peter Joseph Lenn\u00e9 and Hermann von P\u00fcckler-Muskau is part of the UNESCO Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin World Heritage Site and open to the public as a museum. One campus of the University of Potsdam as well as the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam (AIP) are situated within the park. Next to Neubabelsberg is the home of the Hasso Plattner Institute for software systems engineering.\nThe local SV Babelsberg 03 football club is based at the Karl-Liebknecht-Stadion, which is also the home ground of the 1. FFC Turbine Potsdam women's football team.\nThe German Industrial-Metal band Rammstein used Babelsberg castle to film their music video \"Du Riechst So Gut 98\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nSteinst\u00fccken\nWest Berlin\nBabelsberg Studios\nPotsdam-Babelsberg station\nPotsdam Medienstadt Babelsberg station\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nPaul Sigel, Silke D\u00e4hmlow, Frank Seehausen and Lucas Elmenhorst, Architekturf\u00fchrer Potsdam - Architectural Guide, Dietrich Reimer Verlag, Berlin 2006, ISBN 3-496-01325-7.\nJung, Karin Carmen: Die B\u00f6hmische Weberkolonie Nowawes 1751\u20131767 in Potsdam-Babelsberg.

        "wiki": "Potsdam (German pronunciation: [\u02c8p\u0254t\u0361sdam] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of the German federal state of Brandenburg. It directly borders the German capital, Berlin, and is part of the Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region. It is situated on the River Havel some 25 kilometres (16 miles) southwest of Berlin's city centre.\nPotsdam was a residence of the Prussian kings and the German Kaiser until 1918. Its planning embodied ideas of the Age of Enlightenment: through a careful balance of architecture and landscape, Potsdam was intended as \"a picturesque, pastoral dream\" which would remind its residents of their relationship with nature and reason.The city lies in an area of interconnected lakes and is distinguished by a series of cultural landmarks, in particular the parks and palaces of Sanssouci, the largest World Heritage Site in Germany. The Potsdam Conference in 1945 was held at Cecilienhof Palace.\nBabelsberg, in the south-eastern part of Potsdam, was already by the 1930s the home of a major film production studio and it has enjoyed success as an important center of European film production since the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Filmstudio Babelsberg is the oldest large-scale film studio in the world.Potsdam developed into a centre of science in Germany in the 19th century. Today, there are three public colleges, the University of Potsdam, and more than 30 research institutes in the city.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe area was formed from a series of large moraines left after the last glacial period. Today, only one quarter of the city is built up, the rest remaining as green space.\nThere are about 20 lakes and rivers in and around Potsdam, such as the Havel, the Griebnitzsee, Templiner See, Tiefer See, Jungfernsee, Teltowkanal, Heiliger See, and Sacrower See. The highest point is the 114-metre (374 ft) high Kleiner Ravensberg.\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\nPotsdam is divided into seven historic city Bezirke and nine new Stadtteile (villages), which joined the city in 2003. The appearance of the city quarters is quite different. Those in the north and in the centre consist mainly of historical buildings, the south of the city is dominated by larger areas of newer buildings.\nThe city of Potsdam is divided into 34 Stadtteile (or quarters), which are divided further into 84 statistical Bezirke.\nToday one distinguishes between the older parts of the city (areas of the historic city and places suburbanized at the latest in 1939) - these are the city center, the western and northern suburbs, Bornim, Bornstedt, Nedlitz, Potsdam South, Babelsberg, Drewitz, Stern and Kirchsteigfeld - and those communities incorporated after 1990 which have since 2003 become Stadtteile - these are Eiche, Fahrland, Golm, Gro\u00df Glienicke, Grube, Marquardt, Neu Fahrland, Satzkorn and Uetz-Paaren. The new Stadtteile are located mainly in the north of the city. For the history of all incorporations, see the relevant section on incorporation and spin-offs.\nStructure with statistical numbering:\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nOfficially the climate is oceanic - more degraded by being far from the coast and to the east (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), but using the 1961-1990 normal and the 0 \u00b0C isotherm the city has a humid continental climate (Dfb), which also shows a slight influence of the continent different from the climates predominantly influenced by the Atlantic Ocean. Low averages below freezing for almost all winter causing snows that are frequent and winters are cold, but not as stringent as inland locations or with greater influence from the same. Summer is also relatively warm with temperatures between 23 and 24 \u00b0C, the heat waves being influenced by the UHI of Potsdam.The average winter high temperature is 3.5 \u00b0C (38.3 \u00b0F), with a low of \u22121.7 \u00b0C (28.9 \u00b0F). Snow is common in the winter. Spring and autumn are short. Summers are mild, with a high of 23.6 \u00b0C (74.5 \u00b0F) and a low of 12.7 \u00b0C (54.9 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Potsdam\" originally seems to have been Poztupimi. A common theory is that it derives from an old West Slavonic term meaning \"beneath the oaks\", i.e., the corrupted pod dubmi/dubimi (pod \"beneath\", dub \"oak\"). However some question this explanation.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre- and early history ===\n\nThe area around Potsdam shows signs of occupancy since the Bronze Age and was part of Magna Germania as described by Tacitus. After the great migrations of the Germanic peoples, Slavs moved in and Potsdam was probably founded after the 7th century as a settlement of the Hevelli tribe centred on a castle. It was first mentioned in a document in 993 as Poztupimi, when Emperor Otto III gifted the territory to the Quedlinburg Abbey, then led by his aunt Matilda. By 1317, it was mentioned as a small town. It gained its town charter in 1345. In 1573, it was still a small market town of 2,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n=== Early modern era ===\nPotsdam lost nearly half of its population due to the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648).\nA continuous Hohenzollern possession since 1415, Potsdam became prominent, when it was chosen in 1660 as the hunting residence of Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg, the core of the powerful state that later became the Kingdom of Prussia. It also housed Prussian barracks.\n\nAfter the Edict of Potsdam in 1685, Potsdam became a centre of European immigration. Its religious freedom attracted people from France (Huguenots), Russia, the Netherlands and Bohemia. The edict accelerated population growth and economic recovery.\nLater, the city became a full residence of the Prussian royal family. The buildings of the royal residences were built mainly during the reign of Frederick the Great. One of these is the Sanssouci Palace (French: \"without cares\", by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff, 1744), famed for its formal gardens and Rococo interiors. Other royal residences include the New Palace and the Orangery.\nIn 1815, at the formation of the Province of Brandenburg, Potsdam became the provincial capital until 1918, except for a period between 1827 and 1843 when Berlin was the provincial capital (as it became once again after 1918). The province comprised two governorates named after their capitals Potsdam and Frankfurt (Oder).\n\n\n=== Governorate of Potsdam ===\n\nBetween 1815 and 1945, the city of Potsdam served as capital of the governorate of Potsdam (German: Regierungsbezirk Potsdam). The Regierungsbezirk encompassed the former districts of Uckermark, the Mark of Priegnitz, and the greater part of the Middle March. It was situated between Mecklenburg and the Province of Pomerania on the north, and the Province of Saxony on the south and west (Berlin, with a small surrounding district, was an urban governorate and enclave within the governorate of Potsdam between 1815 and 1822, then it merged as urban district into the governorate only to be disentangled again from Potsdam governorate in 1875, becoming a distinct province-like entity on 1 April 1881). Towards the north west the governorate was bounded by the rivers Elbe and the Havel, and on the north east by the Oder. The south eastern boundary was to the neighbouring governorate of Frankfurt (Oder). About 500,000 inhabitants lived in the Potsdam governorate, which covered an area of about 20,700 square kilometres (7,992 sq mi), divided into thirteen rural districts, partially named after their capitals:\nThe traditional towns in the governorate were small, however, in the course of the industrial labour migration some reached the rank of urban districts. The principal towns were Brandenburg upon Havel, K\u00f6penick, Potsdam, Prenzlau, Spandau and Ruppin. Until 1875 Berlin also was a town within the governorate. After its disentanglement a number of its suburbs outside Berlin's municipal borders grew to towns, many forming urban Bezirke within the governorate of Potsdam such as Charlottenburg, Lichtenberg, Rixdorf (after 1912 Neuk\u00f6lln), and Sch\u00f6neberg (all of which, as well as K\u00f6penick and Spandau, incorporated into Greater Berlin in 1920). The urban Bezirke were (years indicating the elevation to rank of urban Bezirkor affiliation with Potsdam governorate, respectively):\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nBerlin was the capital of Prussia and later of the German Empire, but the court remained in Potsdam, where many government officials settled. In 1914, Emperor Wilhelm II signed the Declaration of War in the Neues Palais (New Palace). The city lost its status as a \"second capital\" in 1918, when Wilhelm II abdicated and Germany became a Republic at the end of World War I.\nAt the start of the Third Reich in 1933 there was a ceremonial handshake between President Paul von Hindenburg and the new Chancellor Adolf Hitler on 21 March 1933 in Potsdam's Garrison Church in what became known as the \"Day of Potsdam\". This symbolised a coalition of the military (Reichswehr) and Nazism. Potsdam was severely damaged by Allied bombing raids during World War II.\n\nThe Cecilienhof Palace was the scene of the Potsdam Conference from 17 July to 2 August 1945, at which the victorious Allied leaders (Harry S. Truman; Winston Churchill and his successor, Clement Attlee; and Joseph Stalin) met to decide the future of Germany and postwar Europe in general. The conference ended with the Potsdam Agreement and the Potsdam Declaration.\n\nThe government of East Germany (formally known as the German Democratic Republic (German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik, DDR)) tried to remove symbols of \"Prussian militarism\". Many historic buildings, some of them badly damaged in the war, were demolished.\nWhen in 1946 the remainder of the Province of Brandenburg west of the Oder-Nei\u00dfe line was constituted as the state of Brandenburg, Potsdam became its capital. In 1952 the GDR disestablished its federal states and replaced them by smaller new East German administrative districts known as Bezirke. Potsdam became the capital of the new Bezirk Potsdam until 1990.\nPotsdam, south-west of Berlin, lay just outside West Berlin after the construction of the Berlin Wall. The walling off of West Berlin not only isolated Potsdam from West Berlin, but also doubled commuting times to East Berlin. The Glienicke Bridge across the Havel connected the city to West Berlin and was the scene of some Cold War exchanges of spies.\nAfter German reunification, Potsdam became the capital of the newly re-established state of Brandenburg. Since then there have been many ideas and efforts to reconstruct the original appearance of the city, including the Potsdam City Palace and the Garrison Church.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nSince 2000 Potsdam has been one of the fastest growing cities in Germany.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== International residents ===\n\nLargest groups of foreign residents:\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\n\n=== City government ===\nPotsdam has had a mayor (B\u00fcrgermeister) and city council since the 15th century. From 1809 the city council was elected, with a mayor (Oberb\u00fcrgermeister) at its head. During the Third Reich the mayor was selected by the NSDAP and the city council was dissolved; it was reconstituted in token form after 1945, but free elections did not take place until after reunification.\nToday, the city council is the city's central administrative authority. Local elections took place on 26 October 2003 and again in 2008. Between 1990 and 1999, the Chairman of the City Council was known as the \"Town President\" but today the post is the \"Chairman of the City Council\". The mayor is elected directly by the population.\n\n\n=== Brandenburg state government ===\nThe Landtag Brandenburg, the parliament of the federal state of Brandenburg is in Potsdam. It has been housed in the Potsdam City Palace since 2014.\n\n\n== Twin towns - sister cities ==\n\nPotsdam is twinned with:\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\n\n==== Rail transport ====\nPotsdam, included in the fare zone \"C\" (Tarifbereich C) of Berlin's public transport area and fare zones A and B of its own public transport area, is served by the S7 S-Bahn line. The stations served are Griebnitzsee, Babelsberg and the Central Station (Hauptbahnhof), the main and long-distance station of the city. Other DB stations in Potsdam are Charlottenhof, Park Sanssouci (including the monumental Kaiserbahnhof), Medienstadt Babelsberg, Rehbr\u00fccke, Pirschheide and Marquardt. The city also possesses a 27 km-long tramway network.\n\n\n==== Road transport ====\nPotsdam is served by several motorways: the A 10, a beltway better known as Berliner Ring, the A 115 (using part of the AVUS) and is closely linked to the A 2 and A 9. The B 1 and B 2 federal roads cross the city. Potsdam features a network of urban and suburban buses.\n\n\n== Education and research ==\n\nPotsdam is a university town. The University of Potsdam was founded in 1991 as a university of the State of Brandenburg. Its predecessor was the Akademie f\u00fcr Staats- und Rechtswissenschaften der DDR \"Walter Ulbricht\", a college of education founded in 1948 which was one of the GDR's most important colleges. There are about 20,000 students enrolled at the university.\n\nIn 1991 the Fachhochschule Potsdam was founded as the second college. It had 3,518 students as of 2017.Konrad Wolf Film University of Babelsberg (HFF), founded in 1954 in Babelsberg, is the foremost centre of the German film industry since its birth, with over 600 students.\nThere are also several research foundations, including Fraunhofer Institutes for Applied Polymer Research and Biomedical Engineering, Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute), Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces, and Max Planck Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology, the GFZ - German Research Centre for Geosciences, the Potsdam Astrophysical Institute, the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies, The Leibniz Institute for Agricultural Engineering and Bioeconomy and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, which employs 340 people in researching climate change.As well as universities, Potsdam is home to reputable secondary schools. Montessori Gesamtschule Potsdam, in western Potsdam, attracts 400 students from the Brandenburg and Berlin region.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nPotsdam was historically a centre of European immigration. Its religious tolerance attracted people from France, Russia, the Netherlands and Bohemia. This is still visible in the culture and architecture of the city.\nThe most popular attraction in Potsdam is Sanssouci Park, 2 km (1 mi) west of the city centre. In 1744 King Frederick the Great ordered the construction of a residence here, where he could live sans souci (\"without worries\", in the French spoken at the court). The park hosts a botanical garden (Botanical Garden, Potsdam) and many buildings:\n\nThe Sanssouci Palace (Schloss Sanssouci), a relatively modest palace of the Prussian royal (and later German imperial) family\nThe Orangery Palace (Orangerieschloss), former palace for foreign royal guests\nThe New Palace (Neues Palais), built between 1763 and 1769 to celebrate the end of the Seven Years' War, in which Prussia held off the combined attacks of Austria and Russia. It is a much larger and grander palace than Sanssouci, having over 200 rooms and 400 statues as decoration. It served as a guest house for numerous royal visitors. Today, it houses parts of University of Potsdam.\nThe Charlottenhof Palace (Schloss Charlottenhof), a Neoclassical palace by Karl Friedrich Schinkel built in 1826\nThe Roman Baths (R\u00f6mische B\u00e4der), built by Karl Friedrich Schinkel and Friedrich Ludwig Persius in 1829\u20131840. It is a complex of buildings including a tea pavilion, a Renaissance-style villa, and a Roman bathhouse (from which the whole complex takes its name).\nThe Chinese Tea House (Chinesisches Teehaus), an 18th-century pavilion built in a Chinese style, the fashion of the time.Three gates from the original city wall remain today. The oldest is the Hunters' Gate (J\u00e4gertor), built in 1733. The Nauener Tor was built in 1755 and close to the historic Dutch Quarter. The ornate Brandenburg Gate (built in 1770, not to be confused with the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin) is situated on the Luisenplatz at the western entrance to the old town.\n\nThe Old Market Square (Alter Markt) is Potsdam's historical city centre. For three centuries this was the site of the City Palace (Stadtschlo\u00df), a royal palace built in 1662. Under Frederick the Great, the palace became the winter residence of the Prussian kings. The palace was severely damaged by Allied bombing in 1945 and demolished in 1961 by the Communist authorities. In 2002 the Fortuna Gate (Fortunaportal) was rebuilt in its original historic position which was followed by a complete reconstruction of the palace as the Brandenburg Landtag building inaugurated in 2014. Nearby the square in the Humboldtstra\u00dfe block, which also was demolished after getting damaged in 1945, reconstructions of several representative residential palaces including Palazzo Pompei and Palazzo Barberini housing an arts museum were completed in 2016-2017 alongside buildings with modernized facades to restore the historical proportions of the block.\n\nThe Old Market Square is dominated today by the dome of St. Nicholas' Church (Nikolaikirche), built in 1837 in the Neoclassical style. It was the last work of Karl Friedrich Schinkel, who designed the building but did not live to see its completion. It was finished by his disciples Friedrich August St\u00fcler and Ludwig Persius. The eastern side of the Market Square is dominated by the Old City Hall (Altes Rathaus), built in 1755 by the Dutch architect Jan Bouman (1706\u20131776). It has a characteristic circular tower, crowned with a gilded Atlas bearing the world on his shoulders.\n\nNorth of the Old Market Square is the oval French Church (Franz\u00f6sische Kirche), erected in the 1750s by Boumann for the Huguenot community. To the south lies the Museum Barberini, a copy of the previous building, the Barberini Palace. The museum was funded by the German billionaire Hasso Plattner. The former Baroque building was built by Carl von Gontard in 1771\u20131772, inspired by the Renaissance palace Palazzo Barberini in Rome. The newly built museum was scheduled to open in spring 2017.\nAnother landmark of Potsdam is the two-street Dutch Quarter (Holl\u00e4ndisches Viertel), an ensemble of buildings that is unique in Europe, with about 150 houses built of red bricks in the Dutch style. It was built between 1734 and 1742 under the direction of Jan Bouman to be used by Dutch artisans and craftsmen who had been invited to settle here by King Frederick Wilhelm I. Today, this area is one of Potsdam's most visited quarters.\nNorth of the city centre is the Russian colony of Alexandrowka, a small enclave of Russian architecture (including an Orthodox chapel) built in 1825 for a group of Russian immigrants. Since 1999, the colony has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin.\nEast of the Alexandrowka colony is a large park, the New Garden (Neuer Garten), which was laid out from 1786 in the English style. The site contains two palaces; one of them, the Cecilienhof, was where the Potsdam Conference was held in July and August 1945. The Marmorpalais (Marble Palace) was built in 1789 in Neoclassical style. Nearby is the Biosph\u00e4re Potsdam, a tropical botanical garden.\nBabelsberg, a quarter south-east of the centre, houses the UFA film studios (Babelsberg Studios), and an extensive park with some historical buildings, including the Babelsberg Palace (Schlo\u00df Babelsberg, a Gothic revival palace designed by Schinkel).\nThe Einstein Tower is located within the Albert Einstein Science Park, which is on the top of the Telegraphenberg within an astronomy compound.\nPotsdam also features a memorial centre in the former KGB prison in Leistikowstra\u00dfe. In the Volkspark to the north, there is one of the last monuments dedicated to Lenin in Germany.\nPotsdam joined UNESCO's Network of Creative Cities as a Design City on October 31, 2019 on the occasion of World Cities\u2019 Day.\n\n\n== Parks ==\nThere are many parks in Potsdam, most of them UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Among their attractions are:\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Sports ==\n1. FFC Turbine Potsdam, one of the most successful German female football clubs (Bundesliga (women))\nPotsdam Royals, American football team competing in the German Football League.\nSV Babelsberg 03, football club Regionalliga Nordost\nOlympic Training Centre Potsdam (de)\nUSV Potsdam, Rugby union (2nd Rugby-Bundesliga) and Football (Kreisklasse)\nList of football clubs in Potsdam\nThe Potsdamer Schl\u00f6ssermarathon (Potsdam Palace Marathon) is a marathon in that is held annually in June.

        "wiki": "The Orangery Palace (German: Orangerieschloss) is a palace located in the Sanssouci Park of Potsdam, Germany. It is also known as the New Orangery on the Klausberg, or just the Orangery.  It was built on behest of the \"Romantic on the Throne\", King Friedrich Wilhelm IV (Frederick William IV of Prussia) from 1851 to 1864.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe building of the Orangery began with a plan for a high street or triumph street.  It was to begin at the triumph arch, east of Sanssouci Park, and end at the Belvedere on the Klausberg. The difference in elevation was to be balanced with viaducts.\nWith reference to the north side of the Picture Gallery and the New Chambers from the time of Frederick the Great, Frederick William IV sketched out more new buildings, which would decorate his two kilometer long Via Tiumphalis.\nBecause of the political unrest of the period (March Revolution) and lack of funding, the gigantic project never materialized. Only the Orangery Palace and the Triumphtor were ever realized.\n\n\n== The Palace ==\nThe construction of the Orangery Palace began after preliminary drawings by Frederick William IV. The architects Friedrich August St\u00fcler and Ludwig Ferdinand Hesse were commissioned to turn the drawings into a reality.\nThe building, with its 300 meter long front, was built in the style of the Italian Renaissance, after the image of the Villa Medici in Rome and the Uffizi in Florence.\nThe middle building with its twin towers is the actual palace. This building is joined to the 103 meter long and 16 meter wide Plant Hall, with its almost ceiling-to-floor windows on the south side. In the western hall, the original floor duct heating system is still present and functioning. In the alcoves along the garden side of the castle annex, there are allegorical figures of the months and seasons. In the corner building at the end of the Orangery Hall were the royal apartments and the servants' quarters.\nIn front of the peristyle Elisabeth, Frederick William IV's wife, had a statue of the king erected in Memoriam after his death in 1861.\n\n\n== Orangery interior ==\nBehind the portico, in the middle building, lies the over two-story-tall Raffael Hall. It was based on the Sala Regia in the Vatican. Over a large skylight in the high clouded ceiling, light falls into the Museum Hall. On the red silk covered walls, hang over fifty copies of Renaissance paintings and frescoes. Frederick William IV inherited the works from his father, King Frederick William III of Prussia, and assembled them here.\nThe royal apartments were outfitted in the second Rococo style, connected to both sides of the Raffael Hall. They were intended as guest rooms for Tsar Nicholas I and his wife, Alexandra Feodorovna. The Tsarina was the favorite sister of Frederick William IV, Charlotte, who gave up her name along with her homeland when she married.\nBetween 1949 and 2010 the Palace also housed premises of the Brandenburgian State Main Archive in its eastern wing.\n\n\n== Garden construction ==\n\nThe gardens were styled after those of the Italian Renaissance by the garden architect, Peter Joseph Lenn\u00e9. In the west, below the annex, he designed the Paradise Garden in 1843\u201344. It contains many exotic flowers and foliage plants. The atrium, a small building in middle of the compound, designed in the ancient style, was built on plans by Ludwig Persius in 1845. The current Botanical Garden, with its systematically arranged planting, is used by the University of Potsdam as a teaching garden.\nThe Norse and Sicilian Gardens lie to the east. These completely different garden sections were laid out by Lenn\u00e9 between 1857 and 1860.

          "An excellent building to spend some time around, so much so that I came back again to see it. Unfortunately at the time of my visit June 2017, some parts were closed and most of the fountains drained. However if you go when it is fully open it really is a marvelous location.",
          "I visited the orangerie saturday 27 May and the 6 Euros entry price is totally exorbitant considering that you can only see 6 room out of which only the Raphael room is interesting. When I was sitting on the visitors sofa there a gallery attendant told me that my back must not",
          "A tour which was only in German when we came takes you through roughly six rooms which are impressive but not stunning. The art is largely copies. We did not get into the Organerie itself which looks nice and I would say that you should only visit if you are a a palace",

          "The tour of the Orangerie in Sanssouci Park is a short one, but the highlight is the Raphael Gallery, which presents 50 to-scale copies of the famous renaissance artist's work. One of the early reproductions is the Sistine Madonna, complete with its two well-known cherubs.",

          "On our way to Sanssouci park from Neues Palais, we dropped by Orangerie. It is such a quiet place where we did not see a lot of tourists there. We did not enter into the palace but it is good to take a photo outside. Overall atmosphere is calm and I love this place.",

          "There is no audio guide in English , the only option is to take a page with brief explanations in English. there is a tour with a guide who speaks and explains only in german but if anyone has a question in english she will answer. The place itself is not big but there are",
          "As the flowers were becoming to bloom it already looked nice. It could be a part of your walking (!) tour through the park. We had a rest and stayed for a while. The quietness, the space. Nice",
          "We both agreed that we would visit the Orangerie over Sanssoucci. The crowds were smaller, the rooms were more interesting, and the grounds were amazing. We highly recommend this palace. One of the rooms is dedicated to Raphael reproductions from the late 19th century. You",
          "What an incredible place! As a whole, the Orangerie Palace is ingeniously laid out: a combination of greenhouse, apartments for visiting king and Queen, painting gallery, and observation deck! Though you can't tour the greenhouse (the plants are mostly outside anyway, in the",
          "We visited Potsdam just for a day whilst on a short break from Berlin with out ABC welcome card, we were only there for a day and had no idea how beautiful the place was or how much there was to do. The orangerie was stunning and the views and gardens were beautiful, well worth",
          "If you got all inclusive ticket for Sanssouci Park - yes, go for it, even if it's only for the view from the tower. Big paintings gallery is also very interesting, but all of those buildings in Sanssouci Park have got more or less paintings (mainly more...), so after a while you",
          "This is really very interesting place to see and the guide is super nice lady, explains really well.",
          "The building is big and the tower has a nice view of the park. The interior of the building is very simple since it was used to grow plants. The fee is inclused in the ticket to the Sanssouci complex",
          "I can't comment on the interiors offered for viewing at this Potsdam attraction, but, the outdoor views and vistas are certainly worth the trip up the steps to the Orangerie. Oh yes....... It's FREE! You'll be taking lots of photos , but make sure to take some from the lowest",
          "The orangery is very nice, you can visit 5 or 6 rooms, one large room with about 50 paintings. But you have to pay 3\u20ac for taking pictures... Entrance fee is also 3\u20ac. The view from the top of the orangery is also really nice. But you can see the bureaucracy, there is one spiral",
          "You should wait at the entrance to climb up and see the views and to pay the ticket. The walk through the gardens worth for pictures and relaxation.",
          "We liked this smaller palace. The only negative thing was that the tour is only done in German. The info cards in other languages don't have enough information about all the things in each room. If they provided more detailed cards it would really help people enjoy the",
          "Orangery Palace has been constructed with preliminary drawings by Friedrich Wilhelm IV. The building, is 300 meter long front, is built in the style of the Italian Renaissance, after the image of the Villa Medici in Rome and the Uffizi in Florence. The middle building with",
          "A great way to spend some time as you wait for your entry time at schloss sans souci. It is a short walk down from the visitor center through a tree-covered path. There aren't many rooms and each is based on a color of a mineral such as amethyst or lapiz. You may also walk up",
          "Wonderful idea of taking all the citrus and fruit trees inside in the cold winters.Hard now to think that it actually was jus for trees. It is worth the visit!",
          "This building was largely a place to store plants. The tour consists of a couple of apartments. It\u00b4s between San souci and the New Palace and can be visited on the walk between the two palaces.",

          "The tour was a bit short but so many nice furniture and decoration inside, really worth the detour. would be nice if they opened the orangerie part so we can walk them. visit to the roof give a nice view.",
          "This beautiful building is enormous and must be one of the largest orangeries ever built. It does not seem to be open to the public but can be viewed from the outside when waliking round the park at Potsdam. It is beside the windmill and is close to the Schloss Sanssouci",
          "While we waited for our reserved our time slot for the Sanssouci Palace, we stopped by this Palace. We were able to buy tickets for the next entry time -- no long wait! It was just as beautiful as the other palaces in the Park, but without the massive crowds. The exterior",
          "This well worth visiting even if you don't speak German and can't get a copy of the English notes (I had no problems with either). To my mind it is more interesting and, once you get inside, more beautiful than any of the other palaces/museums in Sanssouci park (though I haven't",
          "You may be pressed to see everything s you realize you didn't allow enough time. If you're going to visit the Orangerie then do it right and take the well guided tour and go up in the tower to look out over the park and Potsdam. Allow 90 minutes, at least (the tour takes 30",
          "As others have stated, you have to take a guided tour to go inside the building and I believe the tour is only in German (our tour was in German, but maybe they have some time slots in English?). This was quite strange as the group that were were in was about 25-30 people and it",
          "Be aware you cannot visit this yourself and have to have a 30 minutes guided visit. They ran out of English notes sheet and I had to settle for French. I am still rather puzzled as to why the tour was in German when most of the group was not from Germany. It is not as if the",
          "We never entered the actual building itself, but just to stroll around in the garden and look at all lovely flowers, fountains and statues was wonderful.",
          "The view ok the roof is really good and worth visiting. The garden leading up is also very nice, be sure to look closely at the garden beds outside for an interesting surprise",
          "Classical architecture and an interesting museum. Such a beautiful and nice place to walk, rest on the grass, sunbath and enjoy the nature and the special view of the palace",
          "The Orangerie was not as busy as some of the other parts of the park. Everyone has to put on slippers over their shoes for the tour and although the guide only spoke German we were given info sheets in English. Beautiful inside.",
          "The park around Sans Soucie is open to public, free of admission fees. This is nice to combine with a palace visit to The Neues Palais (either by foot, or car / public transport / horse carriage)",
          "This is a working orangerie - you can see the plants through the windows. You can visit the castle itself as well. The castle tour isn't very long, but the rooms are nice and there's a lot of porcelain displayed. The best part of this castle is the view from the roof - be sure",
          "We enjoyed our 30min visit of the Orangerie Palais, but it definitely has nothing on the Neues Palais, so if you have time to check out only one, I wouldn't recommend this one. The one redeeming quality here though is that you can take the short climb to the tower and get a nice",
          "I fully agree with the reviews of Lorelei and Dohfar. I wish I had read before visiting. The big problem is that no one warns that the tour is in German only.You only find out at the time when they give you an old card with a very small explanation. I had the misfortune to get a",
          "This Orangery is a wonderful place to visit with stunning views from the top of the tower and the rooms inside the palace are beautiful. However, my experience is similar to Dohfar's. The tour of the palace is entirely in German (something we didn't know before we bought",
          "The Orangery is large building in Park Sanssouci. There are two huge glass-windowed halls (which you can't visit) for tropical plants, and a small palace in the middle. The palace is exceptionally opulent, a series of beautiful rooms. The highlight is the Raphael Hall, with",
          "This is a beautiful palace that is worth the time and effort to get there. Each room has a story and it is so enjoyable to see these beautifully decorated rooms. Take the time to walk the grounds. It is beautiful.",

        "wiki": "The Brandenburg Gate (German: Brandenburger Tor) on the Luisenplatz in Potsdam, not to be confused with the gate of the same name on Berlin's Pariser Platz, was built in 1770\u201371 by Carl von Gontard and Georg Christian Unger by order of Frederick II of Prussia. It stands at the western end of Brandenburger Stra\u00dfe, which runs in a straight line up to the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul.\nPreviously, from 1733, there was another, simpler gate on the same spot, which resembled a castle gateway. Together with the city wall, a form of toll or excise barrier, and the other gates it was intended to prevent desertion and smuggling.\nTowards the end of the Seven Years' War, Frederick the Great had the old gate demolished and built, in its stead, this new Brandenburg Gate, as a symbol of his victory. For that reason the Brandenburg Gate resembles a Roman triumphal arch. Its prototype was the Arch of Constantine in Rome. The Roman influence of its architectural style can be seen, for example, in the double columns of Corinthian order as well as the design of the attic.\nA feature of the Brandenburg Gate is that it has two completely different sides, designed by two architects. Carl von Gontard designed the city side, his pupil, Georg Christian Unger, the field or countryside-facing side. Gontard made the city side as a rendered facade with Corinthian-style lesenes and trophies, Unger designed the field site in the style of the Arch of Constantine with Corinthian double-columns and ornamentation like the golden trumpets. The two side entrances for pedestrians were not added until 1843, under Frederick William IV, in order to cope with the increase in pedestrian traffic.\nAt that time people had to pass the Brandenburg Gate if they wanted to make their way to the town of Brandenburg, hence the name. The gate leads walkers into the city centre pedestrian zone of Brandenburger Stra\u00dfe in an easterly direction up to priory church of St. Peter and St. Paul.\nSince the city wall was demolished around 1900 the Brandenburg Gate has been a free-standing structure.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nPaul Sigel, Silke D\u00e4hmlow, Frank Seehausen und Lucas Elmenhorst, Architekturf\u00fchrer Potsdam, Dietrich Reimer Verlag, Berlin 2006, ISBN 3-496-01325-7.\n\n\n== External links ==",

It has served as a symbol of both the division of Germany and the country\u2019s reunification and is one of Berlin\u2019s most-visited landmarks.The Brandenburg Gate, Berlin.\u00a9 Helga Lade/Peter Arnold, Inc.Brandenburg Gate (left), Berlin.\u00a9 Senat Berlin/Press and Information Office of the Federal Government of GermanyThe gate was commissioned by Frederick William II as an entrance to Unter den Linden, which led to the Prussian palace. It was built in 1788\u201391 by Carl G. Langhans after the model of the Propylaea in Athens. The sandstone structure is composed of 12 Doric columns that create five portals\u2014the middle of which was originally reserved for royal use only\u2014and stands approximately 66 feet (20 metres) high, 213 feet (65 metres) wide, and 36 feet (11 metres) deep. It is flanked by two small buildings, Haus Liebermann and Haus Sommer, which were built in the late 1990s by architect Josef Paul Kleihues to replace the pavilions that were destroyed during World War II. The gate is decorated with reliefs and sculptures designed by Gottfried Schadow, the majority of them based on the exploits of Heracles. In 1793 a quadriga statue depicting the goddess of victory bearing a symbol of peace was added. During the French occupation of Berlin (1806\u201308), Napoleon took the statue to Paris, where it remained until 1814. The gate was later used extensively in Nazi propaganda, and a parade was held there on Adolf Hitler\u2019s ascent to power in 1933. The entire structure was heavily damaged during World War II, and in 1957\u201358 it was restored, with the quadriga recast from the original molds.Brandenburg GateThe Brandenburg Gate, as seen through a barbed-wire barrier that represented the earliest version of the Berlin Wall, 1961.John Waterman\u2014Fox Photos/Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesThe Brandenburg Gate, Berlin.Skip Nall/Getty ImagesFrom 1961 to 1989 the Brandenburg Gate came to symbolize divided Germany, as the Berlin Wall shut off access to the gate for both East and West Germans. It served as the backdrop for U.S. Pres. Ronald Reagan\u2019s famous 1987 speech in which he entreated the Soviet leader, \u201cMr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\u201d The gate was reopened on December 22, 1989, in the course of the reunification of East and West Berlin, when West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl walked through it to meet East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow. It underwent restoration beginning in late 2000 and officially reopened in 2002, though it remained closed to vehicle traffic. ",

          "Nothing to say much about it as a review cause its just a monument that people should visit in berlin, but what i really liked is that everybody is chill and u are allowed to shoot videos and pictures as u like nobody will be annoying even its so busy there all the time, cheers",
          ".. But there is a nearby night market when I visited that was a bigger highlight. The adjacent Brandenburg-Strausse is a little touristic but worth a look. When I visited December 2017, it was rather comically under construction/maintenance. Haha!",

          "Having spent a long day seeing the sights of this pleasant city, then relaxing on the square, which is a pedestrian only area, turned out to be utterly enjoyable. No cars, no fumes, no street noise, only people with strollers and children claim this area. There are shops along",
          "Not as famous as the gate in Berlin, nor anywhere near as large but nicely situated on the edge of the town centre towards the start of the park so easy to find. A nice quick photo opportunity, but if doing so try from the town side when you can get the eagle on the floor in",
          "Berlin's Brandenburg was the gateway for traffic coming from the direction of Potsdam. The converse is true for Potsdam's Brandenburg Gate. If you happen to be in that part of Potsdam, you should take a look.",
          "Brandenburg Gate in Potsdam is the little - and in my eyes more beautiful - sibbling of the one in Berlin. You will inevitably pass by it on your way from Potsdam city centre/train station to Sanssouci castle. There are some nice caf\u00e9s in the vicinity.",
          "A really wonderful sense of history, on a really hot day the fountain in the centre is very appealing! At the end of the Brandenburger Strasse it is a real focus point. There are many different restaurants around this area where you can get a full meal or just a snack, all",

          "Standing in the gate and realizing it was part of the dividing wall of east and west Germany was thought provoking...especially with all the discussion about building a new wall in the USA",
          "It's basically just a big gate. Not a lot to say. There is no ticket fees or lines. Very simple tourist destination.",
          "Please note that this is the Brandenburger Gate in Potsdam, NOT the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. Mini version of it's better known 'brother' in Berlin. Interesting to look at for a few minutes before walking along the main street in Potsdam.",
          "This is the symbol of a free Europe in many ways. Stuck behind the wall in the Death Zone for decades, it is the place that sums up the momentous events the brought the wall down.",
          "The little sister of the gate in Berlin. I did not find it exceptional but it is well preserved and worth having a look when in town.",
          "Visited a few times, night time is best in my opinion, an iconic Berlin monument, a must see on any trip",
          "The gate is located at the entrance to the Old Town part of Potsdam. It is definitely worth going to see and there are lots of cafes nearby where you can sit and appreciate the structure on a pleasant day",
          "I was excited to get to see the historic Brandenburg gate. It is beautiful, and all the little shops and caf\u00e9s around it are really great! Don't miss this landmark!!",
          "This area has wonderful architecture and plenty of shops and restaurant nearby. To get there take the 91 tram from Central Station.",
          "On a cold winter morning, the glow of the stone when the sunlight hit it made this gate all the more beautiful. It stands alone, untouched by the passage of time around it. Enjoy!",
          "Although this one is not as impressive and big as the one located in Berlin, it has to be noted that this one is the original, the real gateway to the l\u00e4nder of Brandenbug.",

          "The Brandenburger Gate, is a very imposing sight when you first see it - there is on the top of the gate, a chariot with four horses and a charioteer.. We went on the City Tour bus, which stopped at the gate for about twenty minutes - if you are in Berlin - this a must to",
          "Quite interesting to walk up to and see but a political rally was on at the same time so was crowded and full of graphic pictures. A beautiful place though and very thought provoking",
          "It goes without saying that, when you visit Berlin, you MUST visit the Brandenburger Tor. It's one of the most iconic landmarks in the city and, for historians, an apt symbol for the Cold War itself. That said, it's a pretty quick stop after the Reichstag, a walk in Tiergarten",
          "No tour of Berlin would be complete without visiting the Brandenburg Gate! Much more than just the symbol of a reunified Germany, it has many more stories to tell. Get there early to have the chance to get (relatively) tourist free photos.",
          "The main city gate is magnificent architectural structure. It is next to excellent shopping and restaurants.",
          "It's small compared to Branderburg Gate in Berlin but quite nice. Built as a victory symbol after the Seven Years' War. Entry point from the Luisenplatz to the most pleasant part of Potsdam running along Branderburgerstrasse. Worth a look if you plan to spend some time not only",
          "When visiting Sanssouci Park and castles rent your bikes at the Brandenburger Tor hotel. Super practical and you don't have to schlepp them all the way from the train station. The monument itself us quite normal.",
          "We toured quaint Brandenburg and enjoyed seeing the mini Brandenburg Gate. You get great views from the main street. There were a lot of tourists here because of the proximity to Frederick the Great's palaces. There are plenty of good photo opportunities around this gate.",
          "The gate is fine - I valued it more as a hub for all the going ons in the city. It's the beginning of Brandenburger Stra\u00dfe, and there seemed to always be some live music or something happening right out in the plaza in front.",
          "In the middle of the city, you need to visit it and for sure you will see it - can miss it. Take a walk behind the gate in the shopping and cafe area and go to see the Holland quarter.",
          "the visit to Potsdam was a highlight fora shot visit in Germany. If you go to Berlin make this day trip ... the gate is only part of the charm of this town",
          "This beautiful piece of architecture I believe is the original Brandenburg gate and is at the entrance to the old village of Potsdam which is just so beautiful and worth a visit. Across the road is a large square which has a fountain and cafes and restaurants around it, really",
          "The Luisenplatz is in the centre of Potsdam and the Brandenburge gate . built by a prussian king- is a bit smaller than ist namesake in Berlin, but impressive None the less.",
          "Less well-known than the iconic Berlin gate, this beautiful gate is well worth seeing. It looks gorgeous in the sun. There is plenty of space to enjoy it on the way to the Sansouci Palace.",
          "Instead of a city wall, the entire length of the wall is now a beautiful promenade that is a joy to cycle through. I really love both Berlin\u2019s and Potsdam\u2019s ample cycling paths. It really beats walking. The promonade connects the Nauener Tor to Potsdam very own Brandenburg Gate.",
          "Frederick the Great, decided to make a second one in 1773 not far from his Palace. Obviously based on Roman models, though smaller than the Berlin Brandenburger Tor is nonethe less impressive",
          "Much more impressive than the one in Berlin. Lots of restaurnat on the way to it, shops, coffee houses and artists. Very nice place and not to be missed when in Potsdam. Recommended!",
          "If you are in Berlin, you can't not visit the Brandenburg gate. It stands at the bottom of \"Unter den Linden\" just in front of the Tiergarten. We passed by it many times on our wanders around Berlin, and it was always very busy with tourists as you would expect. One thing we",
          "The gate was viewed from both sides and is attractive but pales in comparison to the gate in Berlin with its beautiful sculpture on the top.",
          "I wasn't able to see the gate in Berlin due to a festival. I desited to spend my day in Potsdam and see the gate there. It is quite smaller than the other in Berlin but worth to see it.",
          "What do I say...How many bloody beautiful gates can you go through. Well you can go through a loot in Potsdam and they are all beautiful. May I say that this is one of the best towns we have been in in Germany.",
          "If you go to see Potsdam Garden you should also make a walk through the city. We enjoyed this city and this Gate was nice to see too. Stop for coffee etc. We stayed in Berlin, but it was good to visit here too.",
          "If you pass by and make some photos, it is good enough. Nothing special, but if you are anyhow in the area, just stop.",
          "We had a walk through the town which once upon a time was the main town. You can still observe some buildings which have not been refurbished and have the old rustic look reminiscent of the war period. The area also contains houses which are modeled as per other cultures like",
          "It is a nice place but beside going under the gate there is not much to do or see. There is a nice view of the church through the gate, and if you are looking for shops it is the place (C&A, Zara and so on).",
          "The Brandenburger Gate is quite impressive and the beginning of a charming part of Potsdam marked off for pedestrian traffic. Shops and restaurants are abundant.",
          "Very similar to the Brandenburger gate in Berlin without the gilded chariot monument on the top.One of several gates around the city.",
          "Nice place to enjoy street performances and people watch at the end of a day. Have a drink at the Matador to enjoy it in the shade.",
          "This is right in the middle of town. We just happened upon it. It is hard to miss. Good pictures around it. Potsdam is a good town to stop in if you are near. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit though. Nothing to do here.",
          "The best of the three town gates but nothing very special. Lots of traffic but worth walking past on the way to somewhere else.",
          "This gate was built as a victory symbol for Frederick the Great to commemorate his sucess in the 7 year's war. It used to be part of a city wall and people went through this gate into the town of Brandenburg. The interesting thing about this triumphal arch is its two sides",
          "Nice place to hang out in good weather, with the square surrounded by restaurants with outdoor seating",
          "It's nice to see, check off the list. The walk through the neighborhood around it is much more interesting. Surrounded by nice restaurants and cafes, it stands between the Hbf and other major touristic objectives, so it's hard to miss.",
          "Lovely gate in the Dutch Quarter of Potsdam. The entire area is picturesque and charming, a must while visiting Potsdam.",
          "its a nice square and in the middle is the brandeburger gate and on th eleft starts also an entrance to sanssouci park .",
          "Brandenburger street is linked the church and the gate ,Its not something very different or special from other gates in Germany but its a lovely street to walk and have a coffee and see the neighbourhood !! take some pictures too!!",
          "This gate is smaller than Berlin Brandenburgertor but its so cute located in the middle of old postdam with a street full of store and restaurant on the back makes this gate is stand out in the crowd.The great Sansoucci park are minutes away to walk from this gate.",
          "This leads on the main street and it is pretty impressive to look at and in the summer I am sure there is a lot going on around it but in winter it is pretty bare but still work a look.",
          "We had an amazing view of the Gate from our hotel, see my other reviews. Loved this historical beauty.",
          "The Brandenburg gate in Potsdam was not a good as the one in Berlin. It is located in a neat old square at the heart of old Potsdam so its well worth swinging by!",
          "Nice and no more. In his back there is a pedestrian mall where are some good restaurants. Walking distance from the Sanssouci Park.",
          "The gate is symbolic of the old city of Potsdam--make sure to eat while you are there. IT is amazing that something so close to Berlin survived without damage!",
          "This matches the Brandenburger Tor in Berlin. Beautiful to see but quite hard to find and no sign posts",
          "If you are visiting Potsdam, you should visit Brandenburger Gate. It is one of the stops if you are taking the hop on/off sightseeing bus. The gate itself is smaller compared to the one in Berlin but I like the surroundings. Behind the gate you can find a lot of restaurants and",
          "A small version of the real Tor, nothing special but can be done if walking in the area. Lots of cafe and shopping near by",
          "This is one of those things that is worth a visit as it's an important piece of history but it's not somewhere where you will stay long and there's not much to see. I'd recommend doing it as part of a bus tour where you either see it from the bus or hop off and have a quick",
          "We enjoyed our visit to Potsdam and will be visiting again in the future. There is a lot to see and it takes more that a single visit.",
          "The original! Loved the entire area. Lots of small shops in the area. Bit of a tourist trap, but worth it. Try the little ice cream shop nearby!",
          "Been there after a long day at the sans Sousi park. We had nice view from the coffee shop opposite of the gate. Not something special but you cannot miss it when being at the area",
          "Our Segway tour rounded this corner then wow there it was - towering above us in all its grandure and hidden tales of historical significance and now serving for us as a monument for orientation.",
          "it is at he beginning of the main pedestrian and shopping street in Potsdam, there is a nice fountain and few restaurants so you can sit and watch the life around",
          "The gate is an excellent visit. It is to be seen at night when lights brighten it given its well chosen color as well. It is kind of a reminder of the Triumph Arch of Paris on a smaller scale.",
          "The 2 facades are different on this triumphal gate across the street from an entrance to SanSouci park.",
          "Great place to visit. Go at night as they light it up beautifully and to the park just over from it in the day. This is a must if you visit Berlin."

        "wiki": "Potsdam (German pronunciation: [\u02c8p\u0254t\u0361sdam] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of the German federal state of Brandenburg. It directly borders the German capital, Berlin, and is part of the Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region. It is situated on the River Havel some 25 kilometres (16 miles) southwest of Berlin's city centre.\nPotsdam was a residence of the Prussian kings and the German Kaiser until 1918. Its planning embodied ideas of the Age of Enlightenment: through a careful balance of architecture and landscape, Potsdam was intended as \"a picturesque, pastoral dream\" which would remind its residents of their relationship with nature and reason.The city lies in an area of interconnected lakes and is distinguished by a series of cultural landmarks, in particular the parks and palaces of Sanssouci, the largest World Heritage Site in Germany. The Potsdam Conference in 1945 was held at Cecilienhof Palace.\nBabelsberg, in the south-eastern part of Potsdam, was already by the 1930s the home of a major film production studio and it has enjoyed success as an important center of European film production since the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Filmstudio Babelsberg is the oldest large-scale film studio in the world.Potsdam developed into a centre of science in Germany in the 19th century. Today, there are three public colleges, the University of Potsdam, and more than 30 research institutes in the city.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe area was formed from a series of large moraines left after the last glacial period. Today, only one quarter of the city is built up, the rest remaining as green space.\nThere are about 20 lakes and rivers in and around Potsdam, such as the Havel, the Griebnitzsee, Templiner See, Tiefer See, Jungfernsee, Teltowkanal, Heiliger See, and Sacrower See. The highest point is the 114-metre (374 ft) high Kleiner Ravensberg.\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\nPotsdam is divided into seven historic city Bezirke and nine new Stadtteile (villages), which joined the city in 2003. The appearance of the city quarters is quite different. Those in the north and in the centre consist mainly of historical buildings, the south of the city is dominated by larger areas of newer buildings.\nThe city of Potsdam is divided into 34 Stadtteile (or quarters), which are divided further into 84 statistical Bezirke.\nToday one distinguishes between the older parts of the city (areas of the historic city and places suburbanized at the latest in 1939) - these are the city center, the western and northern suburbs, Bornim, Bornstedt, Nedlitz, Potsdam South, Babelsberg, Drewitz, Stern and Kirchsteigfeld - and those communities incorporated after 1990 which have since 2003 become Stadtteile - these are Eiche, Fahrland, Golm, Gro\u00df Glienicke, Grube, Marquardt, Neu Fahrland, Satzkorn and Uetz-Paaren. The new Stadtteile are located mainly in the north of the city. For the history of all incorporations, see the relevant section on incorporation and spin-offs.\nStructure with statistical numbering:\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nOfficially the climate is oceanic - more degraded by being far from the coast and to the east (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), but using the 1961-1990 normal and the 0 \u00b0C isotherm the city has a humid continental climate (Dfb), which also shows a slight influence of the continent different from the climates predominantly influenced by the Atlantic Ocean. Low averages below freezing for almost all winter causing snows that are frequent and winters are cold, but not as stringent as inland locations or with greater influence from the same. Summer is also relatively warm with temperatures between 23 and 24 \u00b0C, the heat waves being influenced by the UHI of Potsdam.The average winter high temperature is 3.5 \u00b0C (38.3 \u00b0F), with a low of \u22121.7 \u00b0C (28.9 \u00b0F). Snow is common in the winter. Spring and autumn are short. Summers are mild, with a high of 23.6 \u00b0C (74.5 \u00b0F) and a low of 12.7 \u00b0C (54.9 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Potsdam\" originally seems to have been Poztupimi. A common theory is that it derives from an old West Slavonic term meaning \"beneath the oaks\", i.e., the corrupted pod dubmi/dubimi (pod \"beneath\", dub \"oak\"). However some question this explanation.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre- and early history ===\n\nThe area around Potsdam shows signs of occupancy since the Bronze Age and was part of Magna Germania as described by Tacitus. After the great migrations of the Germanic peoples, Slavs moved in and Potsdam was probably founded after the 7th century as a settlement of the Hevelli tribe centred on a castle. It was first mentioned in a document in 993 as Poztupimi, when Emperor Otto III gifted the territory to the Quedlinburg Abbey, then led by his aunt Matilda. By 1317, it was mentioned as a small town. It gained its town charter in 1345. In 1573, it was still a small market town of 2,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n=== Early modern era ===\nPotsdam lost nearly half of its population due to the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648).\nA continuous Hohenzollern possession since 1415, Potsdam became prominent, when it was chosen in 1660 as the hunting residence of Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg, the core of the powerful state that later became the Kingdom of Prussia. It also housed Prussian barracks.\n\nAfter the Edict of Potsdam in 1685, Potsdam became a centre of European immigration. Its religious freedom attracted people from France (Huguenots), Russia, the Netherlands and Bohemia. The edict accelerated population growth and economic recovery.\nLater, the city became a full residence of the Prussian royal family. The buildings of the royal residences were built mainly during the reign of Frederick the Great. One of these is the Sanssouci Palace (French: \"without cares\", by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff, 1744), famed for its formal gardens and Rococo interiors. Other royal residences include the New Palace and the Orangery.\nIn 1815, at the formation of the Province of Brandenburg, Potsdam became the provincial capital until 1918, except for a period between 1827 and 1843 when Berlin was the provincial capital (as it became once again after 1918). The province comprised two governorates named after their capitals Potsdam and Frankfurt (Oder).\n\n\n=== Governorate of Potsdam ===\n\nBetween 1815 and 1945, the city of Potsdam served as capital of the governorate of Potsdam (German: Regierungsbezirk Potsdam). The Regierungsbezirk encompassed the former districts of Uckermark, the Mark of Priegnitz, and the greater part of the Middle March. It was situated between Mecklenburg and the Province of Pomerania on the north, and the Province of Saxony on the south and west (Berlin, with a small surrounding district, was an urban governorate and enclave within the governorate of Potsdam between 1815 and 1822, then it merged as urban district into the governorate only to be disentangled again from Potsdam governorate in 1875, becoming a distinct province-like entity on 1 April 1881). Towards the north west the governorate was bounded by the rivers Elbe and the Havel, and on the north east by the Oder. The south eastern boundary was to the neighbouring governorate of Frankfurt (Oder). About 500,000 inhabitants lived in the Potsdam governorate, which covered an area of about 20,700 square kilometres (7,992 sq mi), divided into thirteen rural districts, partially named after their capitals:\nThe traditional towns in the governorate were small, however, in the course of the industrial labour migration some reached the rank of urban districts. The principal towns were Brandenburg upon Havel, K\u00f6penick, Potsdam, Prenzlau, Spandau and Ruppin. Until 1875 Berlin also was a town within the governorate. After its disentanglement a number of its suburbs outside Berlin's municipal borders grew to towns, many forming urban Bezirke within the governorate of Potsdam such as Charlottenburg, Lichtenberg, Rixdorf (after 1912 Neuk\u00f6lln), and Sch\u00f6neberg (all of which, as well as K\u00f6penick and Spandau, incorporated into Greater Berlin in 1920). The urban Bezirke were (years indicating the elevation to rank of urban Bezirkor affiliation with Potsdam governorate, respectively):\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nBerlin was the capital of Prussia and later of the German Empire, but the court remained in Potsdam, where many government officials settled. In 1914, Emperor Wilhelm II signed the Declaration of War in the Neues Palais (New Palace). The city lost its status as a \"second capital\" in 1918, when Wilhelm II abdicated and Germany became a Republic at the end of World War I.\nAt the start of the Third Reich in 1933 there was a ceremonial handshake between President Paul von Hindenburg and the new Chancellor Adolf Hitler on 21 March 1933 in Potsdam's Garrison Church in what became known as the \"Day of Potsdam\". This symbolised a coalition of the military (Reichswehr) and Nazism. Potsdam was severely damaged by Allied bombing raids during World War II.\n\nThe Cecilienhof Palace was the scene of the Potsdam Conference from 17 July to 2 August 1945, at which the victorious Allied leaders (Harry S. Truman; Winston Churchill and his successor, Clement Attlee; and Joseph Stalin) met to decide the future of Germany and postwar Europe in general. The conference ended with the Potsdam Agreement and the Potsdam Declaration.\n\nThe government of East Germany (formally known as the German Democratic Republic (German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik, DDR)) tried to remove symbols of \"Prussian militarism\". Many historic buildings, some of them badly damaged in the war, were demolished.\nWhen in 1946 the remainder of the Province of Brandenburg west of the Oder-Nei\u00dfe line was constituted as the state of Brandenburg, Potsdam became its capital. In 1952 the GDR disestablished its federal states and replaced them by smaller new East German administrative districts known as Bezirke. Potsdam became the capital of the new Bezirk Potsdam until 1990.\nPotsdam, south-west of Berlin, lay just outside West Berlin after the construction of the Berlin Wall. The walling off of West Berlin not only isolated Potsdam from West Berlin, but also doubled commuting times to East Berlin. The Glienicke Bridge across the Havel connected the city to West Berlin and was the scene of some Cold War exchanges of spies.\nAfter German reunification, Potsdam became the capital of the newly re-established state of Brandenburg. Since then there have been many ideas and efforts to reconstruct the original appearance of the city, including the Potsdam City Palace and the Garrison Church.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nSince 2000 Potsdam has been one of the fastest growing cities in Germany.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== International residents ===\n\nLargest groups of foreign residents:\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\n\n=== City government ===\nPotsdam has had a mayor (B\u00fcrgermeister) and city council since the 15th century. From 1809 the city council was elected, with a mayor (Oberb\u00fcrgermeister) at its head. During the Third Reich the mayor was selected by the NSDAP and the city council was dissolved; it was reconstituted in token form after 1945, but free elections did not take place until after reunification.\nToday, the city council is the city's central administrative authority. Local elections took place on 26 October 2003 and again in 2008. Between 1990 and 1999, the Chairman of the City Council was known as the \"Town President\" but today the post is the \"Chairman of the City Council\". The mayor is elected directly by the population.\n\n\n=== Brandenburg state government ===\nThe Landtag Brandenburg, the parliament of the federal state of Brandenburg is in Potsdam. It has been housed in the Potsdam City Palace since 2014.\n\n\n== Twin towns - sister cities ==\n\nPotsdam is twinned with:\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\n\n==== Rail transport ====\nPotsdam, included in the fare zone \"C\" (Tarifbereich C) of Berlin's public transport area and fare zones A and B of its own public transport area, is served by the S7 S-Bahn line. The stations served are Griebnitzsee, Babelsberg and the Central Station (Hauptbahnhof), the main and long-distance station of the city. Other DB stations in Potsdam are Charlottenhof, Park Sanssouci (including the monumental Kaiserbahnhof), Medienstadt Babelsberg, Rehbr\u00fccke, Pirschheide and Marquardt. The city also possesses a 27 km-long tramway network.\n\n\n==== Road transport ====\nPotsdam is served by several motorways: the A 10, a beltway better known as Berliner Ring, the A 115 (using part of the AVUS) and is closely linked to the A 2 and A 9. The B 1 and B 2 federal roads cross the city. Potsdam features a network of urban and suburban buses.\n\n\n== Education and research ==\n\nPotsdam is a university town. The University of Potsdam was founded in 1991 as a university of the State of Brandenburg. Its predecessor was the Akademie f\u00fcr Staats- und Rechtswissenschaften der DDR \"Walter Ulbricht\", a college of education founded in 1948 which was one of the GDR's most important colleges. There are about 20,000 students enrolled at the university.\n\nIn 1991 the Fachhochschule Potsdam was founded as the second college. It had 3,518 students as of 2017.Konrad Wolf Film University of Babelsberg (HFF), founded in 1954 in Babelsberg, is the foremost centre of the German film industry since its birth, with over 600 students.\nThere are also several research foundations, including Fraunhofer Institutes for Applied Polymer Research and Biomedical Engineering, Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute), Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces, and Max Planck Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology, the GFZ - German Research Centre for Geosciences, the Potsdam Astrophysical Institute, the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies, The Leibniz Institute for Agricultural Engineering and Bioeconomy and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, which employs 340 people in researching climate change.As well as universities, Potsdam is home to reputable secondary schools. Montessori Gesamtschule Potsdam, in western Potsdam, attracts 400 students from the Brandenburg and Berlin region.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nPotsdam was historically a centre of European immigration. Its religious tolerance attracted people from France, Russia, the Netherlands and Bohemia. This is still visible in the culture and architecture of the city.\nThe most popular attraction in Potsdam is Sanssouci Park, 2 km (1 mi) west of the city centre. In 1744 King Frederick the Great ordered the construction of a residence here, where he could live sans souci (\"without worries\", in the French spoken at the court). The park hosts a botanical garden (Botanical Garden, Potsdam) and many buildings:\n\nThe Sanssouci Palace (Schloss Sanssouci), a relatively modest palace of the Prussian royal (and later German imperial) family\nThe Orangery Palace (Orangerieschloss), former palace for foreign royal guests\nThe New Palace (Neues Palais), built between 1763 and 1769 to celebrate the end of the Seven Years' War, in which Prussia held off the combined attacks of Austria and Russia. It is a much larger and grander palace than Sanssouci, having over 200 rooms and 400 statues as decoration. It served as a guest house for numerous royal visitors. Today, it houses parts of University of Potsdam.\nThe Charlottenhof Palace (Schloss Charlottenhof), a Neoclassical palace by Karl Friedrich Schinkel built in 1826\nThe Roman Baths (R\u00f6mische B\u00e4der), built by Karl Friedrich Schinkel and Friedrich Ludwig Persius in 1829\u20131840. It is a complex of buildings including a tea pavilion, a Renaissance-style villa, and a Roman bathhouse (from which the whole complex takes its name).\nThe Chinese Tea House (Chinesisches Teehaus), an 18th-century pavilion built in a Chinese style, the fashion of the time.Three gates from the original city wall remain today. The oldest is the Hunters' Gate (J\u00e4gertor), built in 1733. The Nauener Tor was built in 1755 and close to the historic Dutch Quarter. The ornate Brandenburg Gate (built in 1770, not to be confused with the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin) is situated on the Luisenplatz at the western entrance to the old town.\n\nThe Old Market Square (Alter Markt) is Potsdam's historical city centre. For three centuries this was the site of the City Palace (Stadtschlo\u00df), a royal palace built in 1662. Under Frederick the Great, the palace became the winter residence of the Prussian kings. The palace was severely damaged by Allied bombing in 1945 and demolished in 1961 by the Communist authorities. In 2002 the Fortuna Gate (Fortunaportal) was rebuilt in its original historic position which was followed by a complete reconstruction of the palace as the Brandenburg Landtag building inaugurated in 2014. Nearby the square in the Humboldtstra\u00dfe block, which also was demolished after getting damaged in 1945, reconstructions of several representative residential palaces including Palazzo Pompei and Palazzo Barberini housing an arts museum were completed in 2016-2017 alongside buildings with modernized facades to restore the historical proportions of the block.\n\nThe Old Market Square is dominated today by the dome of St. Nicholas' Church (Nikolaikirche), built in 1837 in the Neoclassical style. It was the last work of Karl Friedrich Schinkel, who designed the building but did not live to see its completion. It was finished by his disciples Friedrich August St\u00fcler and Ludwig Persius. The eastern side of the Market Square is dominated by the Old City Hall (Altes Rathaus), built in 1755 by the Dutch architect Jan Bouman (1706\u20131776). It has a characteristic circular tower, crowned with a gilded Atlas bearing the world on his shoulders.\n\nNorth of the Old Market Square is the oval French Church (Franz\u00f6sische Kirche), erected in the 1750s by Boumann for the Huguenot community. To the south lies the Museum Barberini, a copy of the previous building, the Barberini Palace. The museum was funded by the German billionaire Hasso Plattner. The former Baroque building was built by Carl von Gontard in 1771\u20131772, inspired by the Renaissance palace Palazzo Barberini in Rome. The newly built museum was scheduled to open in spring 2017.\nAnother landmark of Potsdam is the two-street Dutch Quarter (Holl\u00e4ndisches Viertel), an ensemble of buildings that is unique in Europe, with about 150 houses built of red bricks in the Dutch style. It was built between 1734 and 1742 under the direction of Jan Bouman to be used by Dutch artisans and craftsmen who had been invited to settle here by King Frederick Wilhelm I. Today, this area is one of Potsdam's most visited quarters.\nNorth of the city centre is the Russian colony of Alexandrowka, a small enclave of Russian architecture (including an Orthodox chapel) built in 1825 for a group of Russian immigrants. Since 1999, the colony has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin.\nEast of the Alexandrowka colony is a large park, the New Garden (Neuer Garten), which was laid out from 1786 in the English style. The site contains two palaces; one of them, the Cecilienhof, was where the Potsdam Conference was held in July and August 1945. The Marmorpalais (Marble Palace) was built in 1789 in Neoclassical style. Nearby is the Biosph\u00e4re Potsdam, a tropical botanical garden.\nBabelsberg, a quarter south-east of the centre, houses the UFA film studios (Babelsberg Studios), and an extensive park with some historical buildings, including the Babelsberg Palace (Schlo\u00df Babelsberg, a Gothic revival palace designed by Schinkel).\nThe Einstein Tower is located within the Albert Einstein Science Park, which is on the top of the Telegraphenberg within an astronomy compound.\nPotsdam also features a memorial centre in the former KGB prison in Leistikowstra\u00dfe. In the Volkspark to the north, there is one of the last monuments dedicated to Lenin in Germany.\nPotsdam joined UNESCO's Network of Creative Cities as a Design City on October 31, 2019 on the occasion of World Cities\u2019 Day.\n\n\n== Parks ==\nThere are many parks in Potsdam, most of them UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Among their attractions are:\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Sports ==\n1.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Sanssouci Park is a large park surrounding Sanssouci Palace in Potsdam, Germany. Following the terracing of the vineyard and the completion of the palace, the surroundings were included in the structure. A baroque flower garden with lawns, flower beds, hedges and trees was created. In the hedge quarter 3,000 fruit trees were planted. The greenhouses of the numerous nurseries contained oranges, melons, peaches and bananas. The goddesses Flora and Pomona, who decorate the entrance obelisk at the eastern park exit, were placed there to highlight the connection of a flower, fruit and vegetable garden.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nWith the expansion of the site after the creation of more buildings, a 2.5 km long straight main avenue was built. It began in the east at the 1748 obelisk and over the years was extended all the way to the New Palace, which marks its end in the west. In 1764 the picture gallery was constructed, followed by the New Chambers in 1774. They flank the palace and open the alley up to rondels with the fountains, surrounded by marble statues. From there paths lead in a star pattern between tall hedges to further parts of the gardens.\nIn his organisation of the park, Frederick continued what he had begun in Neuruppin and Rheinsberg. During his stay as Crown Prince in Neuruppin, where he was commander of a regiment from 1732 to 1735, he ordered that a flower, fruit and vegetable garden be laid out in the grounds of his abode. He already deviated here from the classical organisation of baroque gardens, which concerned themselves purely with the model represented by Versailles, by combining the beautiful and the useful. He also followed this principle in Rheinsberg. Apart from the transformation of the palace, which Frederick received as a present from his father Frederick William I in 1734, he ordered the establishment of fruit and vegetable garden areas enclosed by hedges. In addition the central avenue and a larger intersecting avenue did not lead directly to the palace, as was usual in French parks of the era, but took off from the south wing and at a right angle to the building.\nFrederick invested heavily in the fountain system of Sanssouci Park, as water features were a firm component of baroque gardens. But the Neptune Grotto, finished in 1757 in the eastern part of the park, was used just as little for its intended function as the fountain facilities. Atop the Ruinenberg, roughly six hundred metres away, was a water basin from which no water could arrive into the park and because of the \"fountaineers\"' lack of expertise the project failed.\nIt did not succeed until steam power was employed one hundred years later, and thus the purpose of the water reservoir was finally fulfilled. In October 1842 an 81.4 horsepower steam engine built by August Borsig started working and made the water jet of the Great Fountain below the vineyard terraces rise to a height of 38 metres. A pumping station on the Havelbucht was especially built for this machine. It was commissioned by Frederick William IV and built by Ludwig Persius between 1841 and 1843, in the then fashionable Moorish Revival architectural style to look like \"a Turkish Mosque with a minaret as a chimney\".Many years earlier, Frederick William III had acquired an area which bordered Sanssouci Park to the south and given it to his son Frederick William IV for Christmas in 1825. There Karl Friedrich Schinkel and Ludwig Persius built Charlottenhof Palace on the site of a former farm house and Peter Joseph Lenn\u00e9 was commissioned with the garden design. With the baroque flower and fruit and vegetable gardens from the Frederician era in mind, the garden architect converted the flat and partly swampy grounds into an open landscape park. Broad meadows created visual avenues between Charlottenhof, the Roman Baths and the New Palace with the Temple of Friendship developed from the time of Frederick the Great. Casually placed groups of bushes and trees and a moat that was broadened into a pond at its southeastern end beautify the large park. Lenn\u00e9 used the materials excavated to create the pond to construct a gentle hilly area landscape where the paths meet in the shape of stars at the high points.\n\n\n== Buildings in Sanssouci Park ==\nBuilt under Frederick the Great:\n\nSanssouci\nPicture Gallery\nNew Chambers\nNeptune Grotto\nChinese House\nNew Palace\nTemple of Friendship\nAntique Temple\nObelisk entrance and the ObeliskBuilt under Frederick William IV:\n\nRoman Baths\nChurch of Peace with the neighbouring group of buildingsIn the neighbouring area of Sanssouci:\n\nEnsemble of artistic ruins on the Ruinenberg\nBelvedere on the Klausberg\nDragon House\nOrangery Palace or the New Orangery on the Klausberg\nCharlottenhof Palace\nKaiserbahnhof at Potsdam Park Sanssouci railway station\n\n\n== Points of interest ==\nBotanischer Garten Potsdam, a botanical garden established in 1950\nGreen Gate, Potsdam, the main entrance to the park\nHistoric Mill of Sanssouci\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Sources ==\nPaul Sigel, Silke D\u00e4hmlow, Frank Seehausen und Lucas Elmenhorst, Architekturf\u00fchrer Potsdam - Architectural Guide, Dietrich Reimer Verlag, Berlin 2006, ISBN 3-496-01325-7.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSights of Potsdam\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Sanssouci at Wikimedia Commons\n\nImages from Park Sanssouci",

          "Lovely looking building with gilded figures all around well worth a look for a short while as you stroll around the huge and impressive Sans Soucci grounds",
          "The first impression you get of this building is \u2018bling\u2019 which is, of course, what the original architect intended, but when you look more closely at the statuary outside and the wall decorations inside, you realise that China was not a country that he had ever visited. In",
          "Really loos great! Decorations look fabulous, all these details... The palace is in the middle of the way between palaces...",
          "This sight seems to be another one of the Sanssouci list of sites that only opens seasonally, as it was closed during our end of April visit. We could only see it from the outside, but apparently you can get in. It is quite beautiful from the outside, though... enough to be",
          "We knew the Chinese House wasn\u2019t open to visitors but we figured we would check out the exterior. Sadly the house and the gold figures all need some attention. The area around the figures is stacked with pieces of wood. It looks like some sort of barriers for the park are being",

          "The Chinese House is part of the Sanssouci Palace garden and it looks really beautiful. You can also check it out from inside by paying a minimal entrance fee. Its interesting how the Prussian Czar's were fascinated by China.",

          "The greater park is a vast expanse to explore. I call it a vast expanse as I had to cycle really far from one point to another and I'm still considered within Sanssouci Park. Plenty of sites within the park itself, including this one which is the Chinese Tea House. I chuckled at",
          "It looks like a carousel and it is said to be based on Chinese architecture (although i can't see it). There's golden sculpture which is decorated along the wall of the house which was mesmerizing with the background of pastel colored walls. The fee to visit inside is 3 euro",

          "It's beautiful and worth taking pictures all around it and outside. Not worth paying the entrance fee though as its a small circular room and there didn't look like there was much to see.",
          "It is in a beautiful area and I am sure it is fantastic to see but I have visited the park in Winter and yeah with all the protection boxes around the statues it doesn't really give it justice so I would recommend heading to check this out in Season",
          "Very small but amazing gold leaf decoration. Only available as part of total ticket for Potsdam Palaces",
          "It is pretty over-the-top from the outside; I do recommend you at least see that. If you have purchased the day pass, you might as well pop in and take a quick look around the inside. There isn't much to it and you'll probably be done in a few minutes. We rented bikes for",

          "At more than 4,000 acres, Sanssouci Park seems to go on forever. However, it was well worth venturing to the back part of the grounds and seeking out the Chinesisches Haus (Chinese House), a fanciful six-sided pavilion painted pale pistachio with gilded statues of Chinese",

          "Interesting architecture for Germany, the entire Sansoucci park area reminds me a bit of Istanbul. The chinesse house is very well repaired and you have to pay admision to get inside as in all other ubilding in the park. I went there after the opening hours (Monday closed I",

          "One of the structures in Sanssouci Park which can be visited. Spectacular from the outside and welcoming from the rain on the inside! Worth the walk to visit. If visiting the Sanssouci Palace, it is on the same ticket.",
          "Great as a shelter from the thunder storm, the keepers of this place let everyone hide under the cannopy (usually ticket only). Not that much inside to enjoy, but the whole setting of this big \"China thing\" is just wunderbar. So go inside only if you have all inclusive Sanssouci",
          "This is very nice, make sure you find it, There is a lot of walking involved but the attraction if simply beautiful from the outside. There is a fee to enter inside but from the outside it is like gold gilted. Don't miss it!",

The internal situation of pavilion quite \u0441\u043e\u043e\u0442\u0432\u0442\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0435\u0442 to the name also creates good mood. Entrance to pavilion",
          "YOu have to pay to get inside. So I just looked from outside. It is not very big. In Sansouci you have to pay for seeing the inside for all the palaces. It was a beautiful sunny day, and I just didn't want to go inside!!",
          "A long walk to an overpriced tearoom. Not worth it at all, there are much better examples of Chinese pavilions in other gardens.",
          "Pavilon is open from May, so when I came at the end of April, I had only occasion to see that building from outside. And truely speaking, it is enough for me. It's nice, and quite impressive (with gold elements on the building). You can walk around and observe anything. For me",
          "Been round this place once and visited the outside of it a couple of times within the park of sanssoucui. It was only reprinted a couple of years ago but looks as though it needs it again",
          "Another noteworthy building in the Sanssouci park - oriental style teahouse. It currently houses a beautiful collection of porcelain.",
          "Sanssouci Park is vast and there's lots to see. A visit to the Chinese House is well worth the few minutes extra. It will not take long to see and is beautiful to photograph. No tours - guided or audio. Your guidebook will tell you everything you want to know.",
          "One of the special things about this little house is the monkey that is painted in the ceiling on the outside of the house. He follows you with his gaze wherever you go. Otherwise it is also a very beautiful building. Not really worth paying extra to go inside.",
          "Sorry, but it is not worth visiting the inside of this building (even if you have bought the park day ticket) as there is almost nothing inside. It is worth walking past the outside of the building and taking some pictures if you are in the area.",
          "You turn the corner of a path (I came from the Orangerie direction) and the blue and gold house appears through the trees, a jewel in the sun. The oriental figures are fun, going inside is part of the overall ticket, but it is the first view that you will remember",
          "It is lovely outside, and very pleasant inside. It takes less than half an hour to see it, and that includes walking round it a few times.",
          "A very peaceful and beutiful place , if you have time you should visit this in one of the most perfect parks in Europe.",
          "This was a beautiful place in the park, a little haven of beauty and balance in amongst the gardens. It was so beautiful it bought tears to my eyes, inside the space is so serene, balanced, beautiful. This little building is well worth finding and discovering on your visit to"

        "wiki": "The Marmorpalais (or Marble Palace) is a former royal residence in Potsdam, near Berlin in Germany, built on the grounds of the extensive Neuer Garten on the shores of the Heiliger See (lake). The palace was commissioned by King Friedrich Wilhelm II (Frederick William II of Prussia) and designed in the early Neoclassical style by the architects Carl von Gontard and  Carl Gotthard Langhans. The palace remained in use by the Hohenzollern family until the early 20th century. It served as a military museum under communist rule, but has since been restored and is once again open to the public.\n\n\n== Building history ==\nThe Marmorpalais was designed by the architects Carl von Gontard and (from 1789) Carl Gotthard Langhans, the designer of Berlin's Brandenburg Gate.The Marmorpalais was reserved as a summer residence for the private use of the king, who had an artistic temperament. With this new construction the nephew and successor of Frederick the Great dissociated himself from his childless uncle, whom he disliked and who favored earlier Baroque and Rococo forms.\nThe red brick Marmorpalais was originally a two-story square building. A fine view of the surrounding gardens and lakes is possible from a round pavilion on the flat roof of the cubical structure. Among other buildings, the little castle on the Pfaueninsel in the Havel river was constructed as an eye-catcher. A stairway and gallery accessed from the roof lead into the belvedere. Sculptured putti carrying a basket of fruit decorate the tip of the pavilion. The palace got its name from the grey and white Silesian marble used for the decorative elements and partitioning structures.\nBoat moorings could be approached by members of the court via a large terrace on the lake side of the palace, from which a stairway led down to the water. The king enjoyed extensive boat rides; even Charlottenburg Palace on the Spree river in Berlin could be reached by boat from here.\nOn the nearby lake shore is to be found the palace kitchen, which was built 1788-1790 by Langhans in the romantic style of a half-sunken classical temple ruin. An underground corridor provides a connection with an artificial grotto on the ground floor of the palace which served as a dining room in summertime.\nThe Marmorpalais is closely associated with Wilhelmine Enke (also spelled Encke), known popularly as \"Beautiful Wilhelmine\". As Frederick William II's mistress she had a great influence on the interior decoration of the palace; in 1796 she was made Countess Lichtenau. \nAfter only a few years of use the palace was considered to be too small, and in 1797 construction started on two side wings designed by Michael Philipp Boumann. The architect connected these single-story, rectangular extensions to the right and left of the main entrance on the garden side of the palace with galleries in the form of quarter circles. The marble required to decorate these extensions was obtained by removing Frederick William's colonnades from Park Sanssouci and incorporating the pillars in the new building. This garden architecture designed by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff had originally stood on the main boulevard connecting Sanssouci Palace and the New Palace.\n\nWhen the king died in November 1797, just the shell of the extensions had been completed. His son and successor, Frederick William III of Prussia, being uninterested in the project, only had  the exterior finished.\nThis was still the situation in the 1830s when Prince Wilhelm (William), later Kaiser William I, and his spouse Augusta moved into the Marmorpalais while they awaited the completion of their new residence at Babelsberg Palace (1833-1835-1849). His brother, King Frederick William IV of Prussia, known as \"a royal nostalgic romanticist\", commissioned the architect Ludwig Ferdinand Hesse to complete the unfinished interior structure and fittings for the two side extensions between 1843 and 1848. Frescos with scenes from the Nibelungenlied were added to the outside to decorate the colonnade walls.\nThe building's technical and sanitary facilities were updated when Prince Wilhelm (William), later Kaiser Wilhelm II, and his family lived in the Marmorpalais from 1881 until he acceded to the throne in 1888.The last royal inhabitants of the Marmorpalais were Prince Wilhelm, eldest son of Kaiser Wilhelm II, and his spouse Cecilie, who lived there for most of the year between 1904 and 1917, when they moved to nearby Cecilienhof Palace, built for them in the Neuer Garten.After the German monarchy came to an end in 1918, the Marmorpalais was placed under the control of the Prussian palaces administration in 1926 as a result of a settlement between the Free State of Prussia and the Hohenzollern family regarding property claims. It opened as a palace museum in 1932, with restored interior furnishings from the 18th and 19th centuries.\nToward the end of World War II the palace suffered serious damage when the north wing was hit by an incendiary bomb, and the main building by a grenade. Its condition further deteriorated after the war, over a period of time when the Soviet Red Army used it as a venue for an officers' mess, beginning in 1946.In 1961, the East German GDR Army Museum was established in the building. Inside, historic military equipment, uniforms and historic documents were on display and on the outside, cannon, a T-34 tank, a high-speed patrol boat, a MiG fighter airplane and a rocket were exhibited. The weapons were removed in 1989.\nStarting in 1984, the National People's Army made plans for a fundamental restoration as the building continued to fall into disrepair. These plans came to fruition in 1988 and the work continued in late autumn 1990 after the return of the property to the palaces administration. Since 14 April 2006 all 40 rooms have been renovated and opened to the public. Repair of the exterior surface was completed in autumn 2009 after several years of restoration work.\n\n\n== The interior rooms ==\nBeginning in 1790, Carl Gotthard Langhans was commissioned with designing the interior rooms. Marble fireplaces and antique sculpture were a prominent feature in decisions about the decorative furnishings; these had been purchased in Italy for the Marmorpalais by the architect Friedrich Wilhelm von Erdmannsdorff. This Saxon nobleman, who was already famous for planning and executing early Neoclassical buildings in Dessau-W\u00f6rlitz, had been invited to work in Berlin in 1787. \nOn the ground floor of the main building there is a vestibule leading to a stairway extending the entire height of the building. Behind it is a large room designed as a grotto and used in the summertime as a dining room. This room is situated on the eastern side of the palace and faces the lake. Because of its shady location and the calm, cool effect of its greyish blue marble paneling its occupants enjoyed a pleasant room climate. On either side of this middle axis there were six private rooms serving as royal living quarters. \nUpstairs, the rooms are grouped around the central marble stairway. The largest room, the concert hall, extended across the entire lake side of the palace. It was later used as a salon during the reign of the German Kaisers. The furnishings and decorative architecture of the rooms reflected a taste for the Neoclassical style, the only exception being the so-called Oriental cabinet on the upper floor, which Langhans designed as a Turkish tent with a divan.\n\n\n== World Heritage Site ==\nSince 1990, the Marmorpalais has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin\". The palace is administered by the Stiftung Preu\u00dfische Schl\u00f6sser und G\u00e4rten Berlin-Brandenburg. \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of castles in Berlin and Brandenburg\nPalaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site of Stiftung Preu\u00dfische Schl\u00f6sser und G\u00e4rten - (in German)\nUNESCO World Cultural Heritage site",

          "Even in December it's worth walking through the park. The tour was amazing with a very knowledgeable tour guide who also took her time to answer questions.",
          "After seeing Sanssouci Palace and Schloss Cecilienhof, this place was a bit underwhelming. However, do see it when you have time, as it\u2019s different from the others, with a nice view overlooking the lake and you\u2019d get a peak of the pyramid from one of the rooms.",
          "When I bought my ticket for the 11:30 a.m. Marble Palace tour I was clearly told it would be an hour long and in German but that I could tag along with an audio-guide. It turned out that I was the only one on the tour! Ralf, who took me on this now private visit, graciously",
          "The guiding was in German with English audioguide. If you are not very interested in Kaiser Ferdinand Wilhem's life dont go",

          "The place is very quiet and located just on the bank of Heiliger see, makes this place even nicer to enjoy some quietness in Postdam, unless behind you a group of tourists already came with their bike or guides. Its very close to Cecilianhof and neuen garten Orangerie. There is",

          "Compared to the other Palaces at Sanssouci and Charlottenburg, this one is small. However, it is beautiful and worth seeing. Get a combination ticket for Cecilienhof and the Marble palace.",
          "Marble with English styled country garden. Definitely a must see. Picnic; cycle ride or both just visit the Marmor once.",
          "This palace is quite small and currently being restored. It is beautifully located by the Helliger See.",
          "This palace was occupied by the German royals until 1917. The interiors are a marvel of decorative arts. It is set in beautiful gardens on the shore of the Helliger See. The restoration taking many years was completed in 2009, is careful and authentic. The delightful approach",
          "Well kept, well preserved, with fine gardens and view of the lake. Lots of walking to get there and additional charges for entry, guide, translation, etc., etc. It wouldn't be on the top of my list in Potsdam unless you had unlimited time.",

          "Although I was rather tired by the time I reached this palace after visiting various other Potsdam attractions, I am really glad I made the effort to get there. I walked through the Neue Garten from Cecilienhof, which is an excellent walk, but few others seem to do this. The",
          "Marmorpalais looks simply stunning - red palace situated on the lakeside amidst a beautiful garden couldn't look anything else. It's also very interesting inside - the tour takes you through many rooms with many artifacts. The tours are held in German, but you get an audio guide",
          "The grounds are well groomed and the view on the back side of the Marble house overlooking Heiliger Lake is beautiful. All tours are lead with guides only. There is an additional fee, beyond the entrance price, if you want to take pictures inside. There are audio guides in",

          "A very nice wee palace that sits right next too the lake which is quite almost hidden within the neuer garten, but it is very lovely, also has a interesting kitchen that is built as a sunken temple worthwhile to look at while wandering the garden",
          "If you fancy a change from the touristic bustle, the Neuen Garten offers pleasant lakeside walks through meadows and woods, with the added attraction of this charming little palace. There is enough to be interesting, but not so much as to be tiring. It is only by guided tour -",
          "This is a small palace that, with a mandatory observer (isn't as bad as it sounds, the guides are very informative and friendly), is very interesting to see and hear about. The audio guides are excellent (in English of course) and the displays are very well explained, including",
          "This was difficult to get to, but worth doing. Better on a guided tour rather than on ones own. Be sure to buy a \u20ac3 photo pass before entry. The pass is stamped with the date and so is valid all day in other Potsdam attractions too, which was very handy.",
          "Situated on the bank of the Heiliger See in Neuer Garten is this interesting Palace which is well worth a visit. It was commissioned by Frederick William II of Prussia and designed in the early by Carl von Gontard and Carl Gotthard Langhans, designer of Berlin's Brandenburg",
          "We had a very nice tour of Marmorpalais (Marble Palace) and found it to be very impressive. Floors were wonderful, views, interiors, and an included audio guide in English. A must see in Potsdam. Way more interesting than Charlottenhof unless you are really into the Potsdam",
          "This place is awesome its has a awesome views is the back i would love to come back again,this town is one of my favorite places to be. The castle is so beautiful. A must see if you are in the area.",
          "This was my favorite of the five palaces which I was able to see in the Potsdam area. The guide was fascinating with her stories of the Beautiful Wilhelmina and Friedrich William II, nephew and heir to Frederick the Great. This palace was built between 1789 and 1791 in the",

        "wiki": "Charlottenhof Palace or Charlottenhof Manor (German: Schloss Charlottenhof) is a former royal palace located southwest of Sanssouci Palace in Sanssouci Park at Potsdam, Germany. It is best known as the summer residence of Crown Prince Frederick William (later King Frederick William IV of Prussia). Today it is maintained by the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe park area with its various buildings can be traced back to the 18th century.  After it had changed hands several times, King Frederick William III of Prussia bought the land that borders the south of Sanssouci Park and gave it to his son Frederick William and his wife Elisabeth Ludovika for Christmas in 1825.\nThe Crown Prince charged the architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel with the remodeling of an already existing farm house and the project was completed at low cost from 1826 through 1829. In the end, Schinkel, with the help of his student Ludwig Persius, built a small Neoclassical palace on the foundations of the old farm house in the image of a Roman villa.\nWith designs he created himself the artistically inclined Crown Prince participated in the planning process for the palace and surrounding park.  He referred to this summer residence as \"Siam\", which at the time was considered \"the Land of the Free\", and to himself jokingly as the \"Siam House architect\".\nOfficially the palace and park were named \"Charlottenhof\" in honor of Maria Charlotte von Gentzkow who had owned the property from 1790 to 1794.\nThe interior design of the ten rooms is still largely intact. The furniture, for the most part designed by Schinkel himself, is remarkable for its simple and cultivated style.\nThe palace's most distinctive room is the tent room fashioned after a Roman Caesar's tent.  In the tent room both ceiling and walls are decorated with blue and white striped wallpaper and the window treatments and bed tent and coverings continue that design.  The room was used as a bedroom for companions and guests.\nThe blue and white theme is continued throughout on the palace's window shutters, it seems, in deference to the Bavarian heritage of then crown princess Elisabeth.\nBetween 1835 and 1840 the explorer and world traveler Alexander von Humboldt was invited and stayed in the tent room during the summer months.\n\n\n== Charlottenhof Park ==\nThe landscape architect Peter Joseph Lenn\u00e9 was charged with the design of the Charlottenhof gardens.\nHe completely recreated the originally flat and partly marshy area into an English garden with trees, lawn and water features. He also linked the new park at Charlottenhof to the older one at Sanssouci from the time of Frederick the Great.\n\n\n== World Heritage Site ==\nSince 1990, Charlottenhof Palace has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin\". The palace is administered by the Stiftung Preu\u00dfische Schl\u00f6sser und G\u00e4rten Berlin-Brandenburg.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of sights of Potsdam\nList of castles in Berlin and Brandenburg\nPalaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin\n\n\n== References ==\nWolfgang Fabian: Potsdam.

        "wiki": "Potsdam (German pronunciation: [\u02c8p\u0254t\u0361sdam] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of the German federal state of Brandenburg. It directly borders the German capital, Berlin, and is part of the Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region. It is situated on the River Havel some 25 kilometres (16 miles) southwest of Berlin's city centre.\nPotsdam was a residence of the Prussian kings and the German Kaiser until 1918. Its planning embodied ideas of the Age of Enlightenment: through a careful balance of architecture and landscape, Potsdam was intended as \"a picturesque, pastoral dream\" which would remind its residents of their relationship with nature and reason.The city lies in an area of interconnected lakes and is distinguished by a series of cultural landmarks, in particular the parks and palaces of Sanssouci, the largest World Heritage Site in Germany. The Potsdam Conference in 1945 was held at Cecilienhof Palace.\nBabelsberg, in the south-eastern part of Potsdam, was already by the 1930s the home of a major film production studio and it has enjoyed success as an important center of European film production since the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Filmstudio Babelsberg is the oldest large-scale film studio in the world.Potsdam developed into a centre of science in Germany in the 19th century. Today, there are three public colleges, the University of Potsdam, and more than 30 research institutes in the city.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe area was formed from a series of large moraines left after the last glacial period. Today, only one quarter of the city is built up, the rest remaining as green space.\nThere are about 20 lakes and rivers in and around Potsdam, such as the Havel, the Griebnitzsee, Templiner See, Tiefer See, Jungfernsee, Teltowkanal, Heiliger See, and Sacrower See. The highest point is the 114-metre (374 ft) high Kleiner Ravensberg.\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\nPotsdam is divided into seven historic city Bezirke and nine new Stadtteile (villages), which joined the city in 2003. The appearance of the city quarters is quite different. Those in the north and in the centre consist mainly of historical buildings, the south of the city is dominated by larger areas of newer buildings.\nThe city of Potsdam is divided into 34 Stadtteile (or quarters), which are divided further into 84 statistical Bezirke.\nToday one distinguishes between the older parts of the city (areas of the historic city and places suburbanized at the latest in 1939) - these are the city center, the western and northern suburbs, Bornim, Bornstedt, Nedlitz, Potsdam South, Babelsberg, Drewitz, Stern and Kirchsteigfeld - and those communities incorporated after 1990 which have since 2003 become Stadtteile - these are Eiche, Fahrland, Golm, Gro\u00df Glienicke, Grube, Marquardt, Neu Fahrland, Satzkorn and Uetz-Paaren. The new Stadtteile are located mainly in the north of the city. For the history of all incorporations, see the relevant section on incorporation and spin-offs.\nStructure with statistical numbering:\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nOfficially the climate is oceanic - more degraded by being far from the coast and to the east (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), but using the 1961-1990 normal and the 0 \u00b0C isotherm the city has a humid continental climate (Dfb), which also shows a slight influence of the continent different from the climates predominantly influenced by the Atlantic Ocean. Low averages below freezing for almost all winter causing snows that are frequent and winters are cold, but not as stringent as inland locations or with greater influence from the same. Summer is also relatively warm with temperatures between 23 and 24 \u00b0C, the heat waves being influenced by the UHI of Potsdam.The average winter high temperature is 3.5 \u00b0C (38.3 \u00b0F), with a low of \u22121.7 \u00b0C (28.9 \u00b0F). Snow is common in the winter. Spring and autumn are short. Summers are mild, with a high of 23.6 \u00b0C (74.5 \u00b0F) and a low of 12.7 \u00b0C (54.9 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Potsdam\" originally seems to have been Poztupimi. A common theory is that it derives from an old West Slavonic term meaning \"beneath the oaks\", i.e., the corrupted pod dubmi/dubimi (pod \"beneath\", dub \"oak\"). However some question this explanation.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre- and early history ===\n\nThe area around Potsdam shows signs of occupancy since the Bronze Age and was part of Magna Germania as described by Tacitus. After the great migrations of the Germanic peoples, Slavs moved in and Potsdam was probably founded after the 7th century as a settlement of the Hevelli tribe centred on a castle. It was first mentioned in a document in 993 as Poztupimi, when Emperor Otto III gifted the territory to the Quedlinburg Abbey, then led by his aunt Matilda. By 1317, it was mentioned as a small town. It gained its town charter in 1345. In 1573, it was still a small market town of 2,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n=== Early modern era ===\nPotsdam lost nearly half of its population due to the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648).\nA continuous Hohenzollern possession since 1415, Potsdam became prominent, when it was chosen in 1660 as the hunting residence of Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg, the core of the powerful state that later became the Kingdom of Prussia. It also housed Prussian barracks.\n\nAfter the Edict of Potsdam in 1685, Potsdam became a centre of European immigration. Its religious freedom attracted people from France (Huguenots), Russia, the Netherlands and Bohemia. The edict accelerated population growth and economic recovery.\nLater, the city became a full residence of the Prussian royal family. The buildings of the royal residences were built mainly during the reign of Frederick the Great. One of these is the Sanssouci Palace (French: \"without cares\", by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff, 1744), famed for its formal gardens and Rococo interiors. Other royal residences include the New Palace and the Orangery.\nIn 1815, at the formation of the Province of Brandenburg, Potsdam became the provincial capital until 1918, except for a period between 1827 and 1843 when Berlin was the provincial capital (as it became once again after 1918). The province comprised two governorates named after their capitals Potsdam and Frankfurt (Oder).\n\n\n=== Governorate of Potsdam ===\n\nBetween 1815 and 1945, the city of Potsdam served as capital of the governorate of Potsdam (German: Regierungsbezirk Potsdam). The Regierungsbezirk encompassed the former districts of Uckermark, the Mark of Priegnitz, and the greater part of the Middle March. It was situated between Mecklenburg and the Province of Pomerania on the north, and the Province of Saxony on the south and west (Berlin, with a small surrounding district, was an urban governorate and enclave within the governorate of Potsdam between 1815 and 1822, then it merged as urban district into the governorate only to be disentangled again from Potsdam governorate in 1875, becoming a distinct province-like entity on 1 April 1881). Towards the north west the governorate was bounded by the rivers Elbe and the Havel, and on the north east by the Oder. The south eastern boundary was to the neighbouring governorate of Frankfurt (Oder). About 500,000 inhabitants lived in the Potsdam governorate, which covered an area of about 20,700 square kilometres (7,992 sq mi), divided into thirteen rural districts, partially named after their capitals:\nThe traditional towns in the governorate were small, however, in the course of the industrial labour migration some reached the rank of urban districts. The principal towns were Brandenburg upon Havel, K\u00f6penick, Potsdam, Prenzlau, Spandau and Ruppin. Until 1875 Berlin also was a town within the governorate. After its disentanglement a number of its suburbs outside Berlin's municipal borders grew to towns, many forming urban Bezirke within the governorate of Potsdam such as Charlottenburg, Lichtenberg, Rixdorf (after 1912 Neuk\u00f6lln), and Sch\u00f6neberg (all of which, as well as K\u00f6penick and Spandau, incorporated into Greater Berlin in 1920). The urban Bezirke were (years indicating the elevation to rank of urban Bezirkor affiliation with Potsdam governorate, respectively):\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nBerlin was the capital of Prussia and later of the German Empire, but the court remained in Potsdam, where many government officials settled. In 1914, Emperor Wilhelm II signed the Declaration of War in the Neues Palais (New Palace). The city lost its status as a \"second capital\" in 1918, when Wilhelm II abdicated and Germany became a Republic at the end of World War I.\nAt the start of the Third Reich in 1933 there was a ceremonial handshake between President Paul von Hindenburg and the new Chancellor Adolf Hitler on 21 March 1933 in Potsdam's Garrison Church in what became known as the \"Day of Potsdam\". This symbolised a coalition of the military (Reichswehr) and Nazism. Potsdam was severely damaged by Allied bombing raids during World War II.\n\nThe Cecilienhof Palace was the scene of the Potsdam Conference from 17 July to 2 August 1945, at which the victorious Allied leaders (Harry S. Truman; Winston Churchill and his successor, Clement Attlee; and Joseph Stalin) met to decide the future of Germany and postwar Europe in general. The conference ended with the Potsdam Agreement and the Potsdam Declaration.\n\nThe government of East Germany (formally known as the German Democratic Republic (German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik, DDR)) tried to remove symbols of \"Prussian militarism\". Many historic buildings, some of them badly damaged in the war, were demolished.\nWhen in 1946 the remainder of the Province of Brandenburg west of the Oder-Nei\u00dfe line was constituted as the state of Brandenburg, Potsdam became its capital. In 1952 the GDR disestablished its federal states and replaced them by smaller new East German administrative districts known as Bezirke. Potsdam became the capital of the new Bezirk Potsdam until 1990.\nPotsdam, south-west of Berlin, lay just outside West Berlin after the construction of the Berlin Wall. The walling off of West Berlin not only isolated Potsdam from West Berlin, but also doubled commuting times to East Berlin. The Glienicke Bridge across the Havel connected the city to West Berlin and was the scene of some Cold War exchanges of spies.\nAfter German reunification, Potsdam became the capital of the newly re-established state of Brandenburg. Since then there have been many ideas and efforts to reconstruct the original appearance of the city, including the Potsdam City Palace and the Garrison Church.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nSince 2000 Potsdam has been one of the fastest growing cities in Germany.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== International residents ===\n\nLargest groups of foreign residents:\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\n\n=== City government ===\nPotsdam has had a mayor (B\u00fcrgermeister) and city council since the 15th century. From 1809 the city council was elected, with a mayor (Oberb\u00fcrgermeister) at its head. During the Third Reich the mayor was selected by the NSDAP and the city council was dissolved; it was reconstituted in token form after 1945, but free elections did not take place until after reunification.\nToday, the city council is the city's central administrative authority. Local elections took place on 26 October 2003 and again in 2008. Between 1990 and 1999, the Chairman of the City Council was known as the \"Town President\" but today the post is the \"Chairman of the City Council\". The mayor is elected directly by the population.\n\n\n=== Brandenburg state government ===\nThe Landtag Brandenburg, the parliament of the federal state of Brandenburg is in Potsdam. It has been housed in the Potsdam City Palace since 2014.\n\n\n== Twin towns - sister cities ==\n\nPotsdam is twinned with:\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\n\n==== Rail transport ====\nPotsdam, included in the fare zone \"C\" (Tarifbereich C) of Berlin's public transport area and fare zones A and B of its own public transport area, is served by the S7 S-Bahn line. The stations served are Griebnitzsee, Babelsberg and the Central Station (Hauptbahnhof), the main and long-distance station of the city. Other DB stations in Potsdam are Charlottenhof, Park Sanssouci (including the monumental Kaiserbahnhof), Medienstadt Babelsberg, Rehbr\u00fccke, Pirschheide and Marquardt. The city also possesses a 27 km-long tramway network.\n\n\n==== Road transport ====\nPotsdam is served by several motorways: the A 10, a beltway better known as Berliner Ring, the A 115 (using part of the AVUS) and is closely linked to the A 2 and A 9. The B 1 and B 2 federal roads cross the city. Potsdam features a network of urban and suburban buses.\n\n\n== Education and research ==\n\nPotsdam is a university town. The University of Potsdam was founded in 1991 as a university of the State of Brandenburg. Its predecessor was the Akademie f\u00fcr Staats- und Rechtswissenschaften der DDR \"Walter Ulbricht\", a college of education founded in 1948 which was one of the GDR's most important colleges. There are about 20,000 students enrolled at the university.\n\nIn 1991 the Fachhochschule Potsdam was founded as the second college. It had 3,518 students as of 2017.Konrad Wolf Film University of Babelsberg (HFF), founded in 1954 in Babelsberg, is the foremost centre of the German film industry since its birth, with over 600 students.\nThere are also several research foundations, including Fraunhofer Institutes for Applied Polymer Research and Biomedical Engineering, Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute), Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces, and Max Planck Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology, the GFZ - German Research Centre for Geosciences, the Potsdam Astrophysical Institute, the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies, The Leibniz Institute for Agricultural Engineering and Bioeconomy and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, which employs 340 people in researching climate change.As well as universities, Potsdam is home to reputable secondary schools. Montessori Gesamtschule Potsdam, in western Potsdam, attracts 400 students from the Brandenburg and Berlin region.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nPotsdam was historically a centre of European immigration. Its religious tolerance attracted people from France, Russia, the Netherlands and Bohemia. This is still visible in the culture and architecture of the city.\nThe most popular attraction in Potsdam is Sanssouci Park, 2 km (1 mi) west of the city centre. In 1744 King Frederick the Great ordered the construction of a residence here, where he could live sans souci (\"without worries\", in the French spoken at the court). The park hosts a botanical garden (Botanical Garden, Potsdam) and many buildings:\n\nThe Sanssouci Palace (Schloss Sanssouci), a relatively modest palace of the Prussian royal (and later German imperial) family\nThe Orangery Palace (Orangerieschloss), former palace for foreign royal guests\nThe New Palace (Neues Palais), built between 1763 and 1769 to celebrate the end of the Seven Years' War, in which Prussia held off the combined attacks of Austria and Russia. It is a much larger and grander palace than Sanssouci, having over 200 rooms and 400 statues as decoration. It served as a guest house for numerous royal visitors. Today, it houses parts of University of Potsdam.\nThe Charlottenhof Palace (Schloss Charlottenhof), a Neoclassical palace by Karl Friedrich Schinkel built in 1826\nThe Roman Baths (R\u00f6mische B\u00e4der), built by Karl Friedrich Schinkel and Friedrich Ludwig Persius in 1829\u20131840. It is a complex of buildings including a tea pavilion, a Renaissance-style villa, and a Roman bathhouse (from which the whole complex takes its name).\nThe Chinese Tea House (Chinesisches Teehaus), an 18th-century pavilion built in a Chinese style, the fashion of the time.Three gates from the original city wall remain today. The oldest is the Hunters' Gate (J\u00e4gertor), built in 1733. The Nauener Tor was built in 1755 and close to the historic Dutch Quarter. The ornate Brandenburg Gate (built in 1770, not to be confused with the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin) is situated on the Luisenplatz at the western entrance to the old town.\n\nThe Old Market Square (Alter Markt) is Potsdam's historical city centre. For three centuries this was the site of the City Palace (Stadtschlo\u00df), a royal palace built in 1662. Under Frederick the Great, the palace became the winter residence of the Prussian kings. The palace was severely damaged by Allied bombing in 1945 and demolished in 1961 by the Communist authorities. In 2002 the Fortuna Gate (Fortunaportal) was rebuilt in its original historic position which was followed by a complete reconstruction of the palace as the Brandenburg Landtag building inaugurated in 2014. Nearby the square in the Humboldtstra\u00dfe block, which also was demolished after getting damaged in 1945, reconstructions of several representative residential palaces including Palazzo Pompei and Palazzo Barberini housing an arts museum were completed in 2016-2017 alongside buildings with modernized facades to restore the historical proportions of the block.\n\nThe Old Market Square is dominated today by the dome of St. Nicholas' Church (Nikolaikirche), built in 1837 in the Neoclassical style. It was the last work of Karl Friedrich Schinkel, who designed the building but did not live to see its completion. It was finished by his disciples Friedrich August St\u00fcler and Ludwig Persius. The eastern side of the Market Square is dominated by the Old City Hall (Altes Rathaus), built in 1755 by the Dutch architect Jan Bouman (1706\u20131776). It has a characteristic circular tower, crowned with a gilded Atlas bearing the world on his shoulders.\n\nNorth of the Old Market Square is the oval French Church (Franz\u00f6sische Kirche), erected in the 1750s by Boumann for the Huguenot community. To the south lies the Museum Barberini, a copy of the previous building, the Barberini Palace. The museum was funded by the German billionaire Hasso Plattner. The former Baroque building was built by Carl von Gontard in 1771\u20131772, inspired by the Renaissance palace Palazzo Barberini in Rome. The newly built museum was scheduled to open in spring 2017.\nAnother landmark of Potsdam is the two-street Dutch Quarter (Holl\u00e4ndisches Viertel), an ensemble of buildings that is unique in Europe, with about 150 houses built of red bricks in the Dutch style. It was built between 1734 and 1742 under the direction of Jan Bouman to be used by Dutch artisans and craftsmen who had been invited to settle here by King Frederick Wilhelm I. Today, this area is one of Potsdam's most visited quarters.\nNorth of the city centre is the Russian colony of Alexandrowka, a small enclave of Russian architecture (including an Orthodox chapel) built in 1825 for a group of Russian immigrants. Since 1999, the colony has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin.\nEast of the Alexandrowka colony is a large park, the New Garden (Neuer Garten), which was laid out from 1786 in the English style. The site contains two palaces; one of them, the Cecilienhof, was where the Potsdam Conference was held in July and August 1945. The Marmorpalais (Marble Palace) was built in 1789 in Neoclassical style. Nearby is the Biosph\u00e4re Potsdam, a tropical botanical garden.\nBabelsberg, a quarter south-east of the centre, houses the UFA film studios (Babelsberg Studios), and an extensive park with some historical buildings, including the Babelsberg Palace (Schlo\u00df Babelsberg, a Gothic revival palace designed by Schinkel).\nThe Einstein Tower is located within the Albert Einstein Science Park, which is on the top of the Telegraphenberg within an astronomy compound.\nPotsdam also features a memorial centre in the former KGB prison in Leistikowstra\u00dfe. In the Volkspark to the north, there is one of the last monuments dedicated to Lenin in Germany.\nPotsdam joined UNESCO's Network of Creative Cities as a Design City on October 31, 2019 on the occasion of World Cities\u2019 Day.\n\n\n== Parks ==\nThere are many parks in Potsdam, most of them UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

        "wiki": "Babelsberg Film Studio (German: Filmstudio Babelsberg, FWB: BG1), located in Potsdam-Babelsberg outside Berlin, Germany, is the oldest large-scale film studio in the world, producing films since 1912. With a total area of about 460,000 square metres (5,000,000 sq ft) and a studio area of about 25,000 square metres (270,000 sq ft) it is Europe's largest film studio.Hundreds of films, including Fritz Lang's Metropolis and Josef von Sternberg's The Blue Angel were filmed there. More recent productions include V for Vendetta, Captain America: Civil War, \u00c6on Flux, The Bourne Ultimatum, Valkyrie, Inglourious Basterds, Cloud Atlas, The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Hunger Games, and Isle of Dogs.\nToday, Studio Babelsberg remains operational mainly for feature film productions. Furthermore, it acts as co-producer on international high budget productions.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1911, the film production company Deutsche Bioscope built its first glasshouse film studio (early studios designed to take advantage of natural light) in Neubabelsberg. The company had been originally formed by Jules Greenbaum in 1899 and incorporated in 1902. As his business increased, Greenbaum made a deal with the chemist Carl Moritz Schleussner of the photochemicals firm Schleussner AG in Frankfurt/Main. Carl Schleussner had been involved since 1896 in producing negative film stock for R\u00f6ntgen photography soon after its discovery. In February 1908 Carl Schleussner bought a majority share in Deutsche Bioscop as a film manufacturing, duplicating and sales operation, for a 2/3 share of 140,000 marks, with 1/3 provided by Jules Greenbaum & his brother Max. Ownership of Deutsche Bioscop was transferred to Schleussner AG and registered on 27 February 1908: Schleussner bought out the Greenbaums' remaining share of Deutsche Bioscop in 1909.The first filming in Babelsberg began as early as February 1912 for The Dance of Death by Danish director Urban Gad. In 1920 the Deutsche Bioscop Gesellschaft merged with Erich Pommer's Decla-Film GmbH to form \u201eDecla Bioscop\u201c. In 1928, Decla-Bioscop merged with Universum Film AG (Ufa) which had been founded in 1917. This company built the large studio (which is now known as the \"Marlene Dietrich Halle\") in 1926 for the major film production of Metropolis by Fritz Lang. \nThe first German sound stage in Babelsberg, the Tonkreuz, was built during 1929, to make use of the Tri-Ergon sound-on-film process to which Ufa acquired the rights. Ufa's first successful full-sound film Melodie des Herzens/Melody of the Heart with Willy Fritsch was in fact made in Hungary in 1929, although this was followed in April 1930 by the premiere of The Blue Angel (which was made at Babelsberg) by Josef von Sternberg, with Marlene Dietrich and Emil Jannings in the main roles.\nFrom 1933 to 1945, around 1,000 feature films were made in the studios and on the studio lot. Under the direction of Hitler's propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels, the studio churned out hundreds of films including Leni Riefenstahl's openly propagandistic Triumph of the Will (1935). The virulently anti-Semitic propaganda film Jud S\u00fcss (The Jew S\u00fcss) (1940), was also made at Babelsberg.On May 17, 1946 the DEFA (Deutsche Film AG) was established, producing over 800 feature films, including 150 children's films. In addition, over 600 films were made for television from 1959 to 1990. The DEFA period was honored by a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) in New York City in 2005.\nAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Treuhand took over the responsibility for the privatisation of the former DEFA. In August 1992, the Treuhandanstalt sold the former DEFA film studios in Babelsberg to the French group Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux (later absorbed into Vivendi Universal). Over the following 12 years the company invested around \u20ac500 million updating the studio's infrastructure.\nIn July 2004, Vivendi sold Studio Babelsberg to the investment company FBB (Filmbetriebe Berlin Brandenburg GmbH), which has Carl Woebcken and Christoph Fisser as shareholders. In Spring of 2005, the restructured studio presented an initial public offering and began trading on the free market.\n2007 was the most profitable year since the Studio's privatization in 1992 - 12 feature films were shot at Studio Babelsberg, among them Valkyrie with Tom Cruise, The International with Clive Owen, and The Reader with Kate Winslet.\nIn 2008 Studio Babelsberg and Hollywood producer Joel Silver formed a strategic alliance to produce feature films from the Dark Castle production slate at the world\u2019s oldest film studio.\nRecent co-productions of Studio Babelsberg include Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds (released 2009), Roman Polanski's The Ghost Writer (2010), Brian De Palma's Passion (2012), and George Clooney's The Monuments Men (2014).\n\n\n== Notable films shot at Babelsberg Studios ==\n\n\n=== Series ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBock, Hans-Michael; Bergfelder, Tim, eds.

          "This amazing film park was laid out on the site where Germany\u2019s first films were produced in 1912. The studio is still operational, and the public can admire some of the old sets, the creation of special effects and stuntmen in action. The location is with the fresh air and",
          "The place is great fore half day near berlin. It has a few nice shows. It also have some nice attractions, and the back stage tour is very nice. Most of the park is in german but English is ok as well. It is mostly for kids up to age 14-15. The staff is very nice. Do not miss",
          "Nothing to write home about. A tiny \"park\" which feels like it is stuck in the seventies. I would ber an average ride at a Disney theme park would use up half the space of all the attractions here. I do believe, though, that kids aged 4-14 will like this, so consider it if you",
          "Ok this is not a huge site with tons of things to do! But for a family with 3 children aged 6,6 and 8 years this was a wonderful place to spend 7 hours!! We were here an early springday with wonderful warm weather and not to many other visitors. So we could go on the 4D Action",
          "Unexpected we stayed 8h in this park. Thought 2-3h would be enough. Once u r in, u will see so many many different und thrilling parts to see. The tours are guided and pretty good explained. All time the safety is given. It\u2019s fun for the kids and for adults. Game area for the",
          "Everything relating to film production and television can be found here. Filmpark Babelsberg is also home of Ufa film-studios. Shows are fantastic when stuntmen and pyrotechnicians are in performance. An audio-guide is highly recommended.",
          "Our second visit here. Easier to get to than last time - S bahn goes directly from centre of city then got off at Babelsberg Station - cross road and go to first bus stop on the left where buses to the filmpark are marked. Get off after six stops - called Babelsberg to make life",
          "Should advise people not to visit If you haven't go any knowledge in german..... visited with my son 15 year who was really disappointed. Last show with Pirates we could not attend because there was not enough seats for everyone.",
          "Considering the cinematic history that has been made at the Babelsberg studios, this theme park is quite pitiful. It resembles a 3rd rate roadside attraction - and an expensive one at that. Adults pay \u20ac22, children \u20ac15. You'd think that at those rates the rides inside would be",
          "Don't go there , nothing much to do there. We visited for less than an hour.. The kida (12_13) ask to leave before the stunts show started",
          "This could have been a great experience. Magic of movie making, action shows, interesting interactive shows, and the like. We've encountered 2 major problems with the place. 1. Admission is greatly overpriced. You can purchase a family pass for 65 euros and 3 euros for parking,",
          "I went with friends and this park has a little bit of everything but not enough of anything. It really can't seem to make up its mind what it is. One small kiddie boat ride, one--fun--video arcade ride that seats 26 and allows you to compete among the group to shoot pirate",
          "It's a little provincial, as all of Brandenburg is. But the film sets and exhibits are interesting for anyone who loves films. They show old German film history and a surprising number of big Hollywood productions filmed here.",
          "The place offers cool shows: Action Film making Tv show etc... All shows are in German so are all the other guided tours in the attraction. The tickets are not expensive and we did enjoyed though we don't speak German.",
          "Went with grandchildrenQuite \"east German\" - Charming! . The old Sandman cartoons reviwed. Lots of things to do. Interactive rides and stuntshow were the highlights.",
          "It had a unique stunt show, a dramatic play and many more. I enjoyed a lot the thematical small areas inside the park, it gives good photos. Also some simulators of TV show, submarine,... and games.",
          "It is an interesting place to visit, if you did not visit before things like the Universal Studios or MGM Studios. One thing to have in mind is that once inside, drinks are very expensive; one small bottle of water costs 3 euro.",
          "I had a fabulous time here with my family. It is not an amusement park, though there are a couple of 4D activities to do (not suitable for children under 6 years), and a couple of stunt shows to watch. It is more about walking around sets that were used for movies and tv shows",
          "The Filmpark was quite easy to find by train and bus. The park is quite small and is mainly filled up with old sets from tv shows with a themed shop in each. At the back there is a building with props, make-up and costume which children could try on. There is a stunt show which",
          "Nice park . Clean , tidy , quite slow at the fast food queues . My big disappointment was that all the shows were in German which was difficult for us to understand.",
          "Had a great day there. The stunt shows deserve an A+. Can't say too much about the other ones, since they were all in German, and I don't speak the language. This is an area with room for improvement, to add more information in other languages. This is not Universal studios and",
          "From Fritz Lang & Marlene Dietrich to Brad Pitt & Steven Spielberg, the studios at Babelsberg are a huge part of past and present film history. The Filmpark offers audiences an opportunity to see spectacular film recreation stunt shows and programs. The guided walking tour",
          "Although we were given a tape with English translation, so much of this experience wasn't translated and we came away feeling a little disappointed. None of the shows were translated and there was one which had animals in it, which was awful, quite naff and the raised seating",
          "I was fortunate to come here for entertainment in a business trip, we had dedicated stunt personnel to show and teach us different stunts - we were set on fire, learnt how to pretend to fight, jumped from a very high platform in rappel, using single rope technique and we had to",
          "As soon as we walked through the door it felt like we were transported into a different world (film making world). We had a chance to experience the sets, props, customes and both the old and latest technical equipment. A real insight behind the scenes of film making tricks,",
          "We spend a whole day there. They have many original sets from many great filma. I enjoyed walking the military camp set from Monuments Men (George Cloony/Matt Damon etc.). They offer an English Audio guide for when you walk around in the park. Watched the Stunt Show in the",
          "We went on a rainy day to the Filmpark Babelsberg. There are several studios showing how movies are created and moderated. It's designed for kids of any age. I recommend the stundmen-show not for kids below age 6 as it gets very loud. The Sandm\u00e4nnchen is very nice for the very",
          "We went to the park after the stunts were no longer being shown. We took a tour of the GZSZ set. Potsdam has much more to offer than this so personally I'd put it on the bottom of the list.",
          "If you don't have small kids, this place will be boring. Also, if your small kids have already been to Disney, Six Flags, or a Paramount theme park (or any good theme park), they may find this place boring. There wasn't that much to so. We went to a show at 15:30 about how they",
          "A single-day small theme park with the potential of the direct link to real Film Studios, heirs of the mythical UFA Studies. In fact, this area of Potsdam from the Twenties produces the German filmography: Metropolis, The Blue Angel, Calegari, Nosferatu \u2026. With Nazism, World War",
          "Went here earlier this week. Slightly awkward to get to by public transport from Berlin but worth the effort. Best part was the stunt show followed by the Three Musketeers. Limited seating at the latter - may be hard to get on on busier days which would be disappointing. Lots of",

          "For me, the only interesting part of the park was the \"media city\" which has the sceneries of popular \"Gute Zeiten Schlechte Zeiten\" (if you're lucky you can even see them during production of the series) and a typical 1930/40's Berlin street in which they turned \"Inglorious",

          "dissapointing park, especially when you know Disneyland Orlando or LA. or any american amusement park. Clean bathrooms, but the park is very little, made for young teenagers or little ones. Just a few shows, I guess they lack imagination or it is me.. My children (13) liked some",

          "As a family outing, it was a great place to visit, fairly expensive for a family of four. The exhibits were interesting but as a lot was only in German we did not get as much out of it as a German family would but still a great place to visit all the same"

        "wiki": "The Protestant Church of Peace (German: Friedenskirche) is situated in the Marly Gardens on the Green Fence (Am Gr\u00fcnen Gitter) in the palace grounds of Sanssouci Park in Potsdam, Germany. The church was built according to the wishes and with the close involvement of the artistically gifted King Frederick William IV and designed by the court architect, Ludwig Persius. After Persius' death in 1845, the architect Friedrich August St\u00fcler was charged with continuing his work. Building included work by Ferdinand von Arnim and Ludwig Ferdinand Hesse also. The church is located in the area covered by the UNESCO World Heritage Site Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin.\nThe cornerstone of the churchhouse was laid on 14 April 1845. The building was dedicated on 24 September 1848, though construction continued until 1854. The structure resembles a High Medieval Italian monastery.\n\n\n== The Church of Peace ==\nFrederick William himself made the original sketches on which the design was to be based. He gave his court architect Ludwig Persius two main instructions: The church was to derive in form and size from the early Christian Basilica di San Clemente in Rome. And it had to accommodate the apse mosaic from the church San Cipriano on the island of Murano in the Venetian Lagoon, which Frederick William had purchased in 1834 when that church was scheduled for demolition. A popular etching of the early Christian version of the Basilica di San Clemente in Rome made by Johann Gottfried Gutensohn and Johann Michael Knapp probably inspired the design of the Potsdam church.Under Frederick William, the church served as the chapel royal and as church for the parish of Brandenburger Vorstadt (a part of Potsdam).The church is a columned basilica with three naves and no transept, with a free-standing belltower. The 13.5 m high central nave overlaps the side aisles, which are half as wide. An arcade of central arches mark the crossing point. \nThe religious Frederick William IV desired a flat coffered ceiling on the inside, with gold stars on a blue base painted on the panels. \nThe king saw the design of early Christian sacred buildings, converted from market and court halls, as particularly appropriate. He was trying to establish a reconciliation between the Protestant majority of the original Prussian state and the Catholics of the more recently acquired lands, notably in the Rhineland Province. Since he associated Gothic architecture with the Catholic faith, he was looking for an alternative design vocabulary for the Prussian-Protestant church. Skipping Martin Luther, he went back to early Christianity as an inspiration. However, he did not distinguish too finely between early Christian and High Medieval architecture - as long as it was Romanesque.An original Venetian mosaic from the early 13th century decorates the church's apse. While he was crown prince Frederick William had it bought at auction for 385 thalers and brought to Potsdam by boat. The mosaic shows the enthroned Christ with the Book of Life, the right hand upheld in blessing. At each side stand Mary and John the Baptist. Next to them stand the apostle Peter and Saint Cyprian, martyred by beheading in 258 and patron saint of Saint Cipriana, wearing chasubles. As an allegory for the Holy Spirit, a pigeon decorates the vertex of the hemisphere. Over the heads of the archangels Raphael and Michael a lamb shines as a symbol of Christ. On the semicircle of the apse a Latin inscript reads, according to Martin Luther's translation: \"Lord, I have love for the site of your house and the place where your glory resides\".\nThe altar canopy, which rests on four dark green columns, was created from Siberian jasper (semi-precious stones) and was a gift from Tsar Nicholas I of Russia, the king's brother in law. It was installed in the Church of Peace in 1842.\nIn the right-hand aisle lies the former baptistery. The six-sided baptismal stone was relocated in 1965.\nThe counterpart to the baptistery is the sacristy in the left-hand aisle. After the death of Frederick William IV it was used temporarily as a mausoleum for him and for other deceased members of the House of Hohenzollern. The son of Emperor Friedrich III and his wife Empress Victoria, as well as the Princes Sigismund and Waldemar, were entombed here until 1892. In 1920 the youngest son of Wilhelm II, the last Emperor of Germany, was interred  in the sacristy. After 1931 he was moved to the Antique Temple.\nUnder two marble tablets, embedded in the ground in front of the steps of the altar room, the royal crypt can be found. Frederick William IV died following several strokes on 2 January 1861, and following the dedication of the crypt in October 1864 his coffin was placed there. The heart of the king, however, rests in the mausoleum of Charlottenburg Palace in Berlin. He was laid in the ground at the feet of his parents, King Frederick William III and Queen Louise.\nIn 1873 his wife Elisabeth Ludovika followed him to the grave. Both coffins, made out of English tin, carry the same inscript as the marble plates in the church floor: \"Here he rests in God, his Redeemer, in the hope of resurrection in the soul and a merciful judgement, justified solely by the service of Jesus Christ our most holy Saviour and Only Life\".\nIn the year of the crypt's dedication, the flooring of the church was completed as Frederick William IV had wished; the design is an intricately interleaved endless ribbon which represents eternity.\nThe free-standing, 42 m high campanile (belltower), on the southern side, is based on the design of the campanile of Santa Maria in Cosmedin in Rome. An aedicula (column-bearing dais) on the east side bears the fresco \"Jesus in Gethsemane\" by Eduard Steinbr\u00fcck. The tower has seven open floors. The four bells, named Gratia, Clementia, Pax and Gloria, sound from the third floor above the clockwork. In 1917 and 1945 they were all taken from the tower to be melted down for the war effort, but escaped this unhappy fate.\nAn open porch (narthex) across the western side of the portal opens into an inner courtyard (atrium). The larger-than-life statue of Christ on the fountain is a copy of the marble original, created in 1821 by Bertel Thorvaldsen, in the Copenhagen Church of Our Lady. The ancient Greek inscript on the edge of the fountain reads: \"Cleanse thyself of thy sins and not just thy face\". An arcade surrounds the inner courtyard.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Kaiser Friedrich Mausoleum ==\n\nThe Kaiser Friedrich Mausoleum was added to the north side between 1888 and 1890. The plans were drawn up by Julius Carl Raschdorff, who also designed the Berlin Cathedral from 1893 to 1905, in the style of the Baroque-influenced Italian High Renaissance. The 17th century Chapel of the Holy Tomb in Innichen, South Tyrol, Italy serves as an archetype for the mausoleum.\nThe mausoleum is a domed structure with an oval outline and an attached rectangular altar room. The inside contains a surrounding gallery and the domed roof, supported by two black columns, one on top of the other, which run around the edge. A golden mosaic on the inside of the roof shows alternating angels and palm trees.\nIn the middle of the rotunda stands the marble sarcophagus of German Emperor Friedrich III and his wife Empress Victoria, formerly Princess Royal of Great Britain and Ireland. The effigies were executed by Reinhold Begas, who also completed the sarcophagi which stand on the side walls of the altar room and contain the remains of Prince Sigismund (1864\u20131866) and Prince Waldemar (1868\u20131879), sons of the imperial couple who both died at a young age; they were transferred into the mausoleum from the Church of Peace.\nSince 1991, the plain coffin of the Soldier-King Frederick William I has stood on the steps to the altar. Originally entombed in the now destroyed Garrison Church in Potsdam, like his son Frederick the Great, the coffin was moved shortly before the end of the war in 1945. Until 1953 it lay in the Elisabeth Church in Marburg, Hesse, and until 1991 in Burg Hohenzollern at Hechingen, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The original black marble sarcophagus was destroyed in 1945, and the current one is a copy made from copper.\n\n\n== Heilsbronn Porch ==\n\nA marble relief in the south part of the arcade is the last work of the sculptor Christian Daniel Rauch. It shows \"Moses in prayer, supported by the high priests Aaron and Hur\".\nParallel to the southern arcade runs the cloister with the Heilsbronn Porch, an entrance to the Marly Gardens. It is a replica of a Roman tiered porch at the former refectory in the Heilsbronn Cloister in Middle Franconia, which caught the eye of the architect Ludwig Ferdinand Hesse while he was on a study trip in 1828. He instructed the Berlin potter Tobias Feilner to imitate the entrance in reddish terracotta. Frederick William IV explicitly rejected Hesse's suggestion to incorporate the copy, but Hesse nonetheless had the porch installed two years after the king's death. The original from the Heilsbronn Cloister was brought to the National Germanic Museum in Nuremberg, where it was almost entirely destroyed at the end of the Second World War in 1945.\n\n\n== Adjacent buildings and gates ==\nTo the south, along the length of the bell tower, stretches the Cavalier's House, a former guest house. Adjoining it is the Porter's House with its short tower and in the right-hand nook is the Rector's and Schoolhouse.\nFrederick William IV had two entrances to the park created for the congregation. One a low auxiliary gate built near the Green Fence. Through it visitors arrive with \"reverentially bowed posture\" onto the grounds of the Church of Peace.\nA second entrance, that is no longer used today, lies on the eastern edge of the park, near the Obelisk. The Gate of Three Kings was created by Ludwig Ferdinand Hesse in the classical style and shows sculptures of Kings David, Solomon and Charlemagne.\n\n\n== The park grounds ==\nWith the eastern outskirts of the park Frederick William IV wanted to create, among others, a connection between the park and the city. In the Marly Gardens, the kitchen garden of the soldier-king Frederick William I, a place of tranquility was created. The garden architect Peter Joseph Lenn\u00e9 embedded the group of buildings in an attractive park with two distinct gardens.\nThe Garden of Peace, on the side of the city in the east, is planted with small groups of trees and bushes laid out and contains the Pool of Peace. The water plays around the church building on the north and east sides. The Marly Gardens, only three hectares in area, adjoins the site of the church on the west. The compact planting of groups of trees and bushes, access balconies, flower beds and sculptures reflect a picture of romantic playfulness.\n\n\n== Current state ==\nAs of 2015, various parts of the church were in need of repair. The Campanile has already required emergency stabilisation work. The Venetian mosaic is also at risk. The iron parts of the construction underlying the mosaic (imported in its original mortar setting) are rusting. In addition, the roofs of the side aisles are leaking, allowing water to seep into the walls.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChurch of the Redeemer, Sacrow\n\n\n== References ==\nPEDA-Kunstf\u00fchrer: Die Friedenskirche zu Potsdam-Sanssouci.

        "wiki": "The Einstein Tower (German: Einsteinturm) is an astrophysical observatory in the Albert Einstein Science Park in Potsdam, Germany built by architect Erich Mendelsohn. It was built on the summit of the Potsdam Telegraphenberg to house a solar telescope designed by the astronomer Erwin Finlay-Freundlich. The telescope supports experiments and observations to validate (or disprove) Albert Einstein's relativity theory. The building was first conceived around 1917, built from 1919 to 1921 after a fund-raising drive, and became operational in 1924. Although Einstein never worked there, he supported the construction and operation of the telescope. It is still a working solar observatory today as part of the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam. Light from the telescope is directed down through the shaft to the basement where the instruments and laboratory are located. There were more than half a dozen telescopes in the laboratory.\nThis was one of Mendelsohn's first major projects, completed when a young Richard Neutra was on his staff, and is his best-known building. Between 1917\u20131920 Mendelsohn created numerous sketches with the attempt to create a structure that reflects Einstein's groundbreaking theories.  \nThe exterior was originally conceived in concrete, but due to construction difficulties with the complex design and shortages from the war, much of the building was actually realized in brick, covered with stucco. Because the material was changed during construction of the building, the designs were not updated to accommodate them. This caused many problems, such as cracking and dampness. Extensive repair work had to be done only five years after the initial construction, overseen by Mendelsohn himself. Since then numerous renovations have been done periodically.\nThe building was heavily damaged by Allied bombing during World War II, leaving it in a state that, as the architecture blog A456 noted, was ironically more in line with Mendelsohn's conceptual sketches than the pre-war structure was. It underwent a full renovation in 1999, for its 75th anniversary, to correct problems with dampness and decay that had meant decades of repair. It is often cited as one of the landmarks of expressionist architecture.\nAccording to lore, Mendelsohn took Einstein on a long tour of the completed structure, waiting for some sign of approval. The design, while logical and perfectly sufficient to its purpose, stood out like an \"ungainly spaceship\" in the suburbs of Potsdam. Einstein said nothing until hours later, during a meeting with the building committee, when he whispered his one-word judgment: \"Organic\". Mendelsohn himself said that he had designed it out of some unknown urge, letting it emerge from \"the mystique around Einstein's universe\".\n\n\n== Research ==\n\n\n=== Equipment and initial research focus ===\nIn 1911 Einstein published the initial version of his innovative General Theory of Relativity. One of the predicted effects according to the theory was a slight shift of spectral lines in the sun\u2019s gravitation field, now known as the red shift. The solar observatory in Potsdam was designed and constructed primarily to verify this phenomenon.\nThe Mount Wilson Observatory in California, the first tower telescope worldwide, was the model for the facility designed by Freundlich. In tower telescopes a coelostat (a system with two deflecting mirrors, pronounced \"seelostat\") at the top of a vertical construction directs light down to an objective. The actual lens system is rigidly integrated into the construction. The mirrors at the top are movable and only these small lightweight instrument components are needed to track the sun. Because of the vertical arrangement, air turbulence near the ground has virtually no effect.\nIn the Einstein Tower the construction containing the optics consists of two wooden platforms, each six m high, placed one above the other. The telescope has a lens objective of 60 cm diameter and focal length of 14 m. Rooms for observations and measurements are located at the base of the tower. In California the lab rooms are under each other; in Potsdam they are arranged horizontally. Another rotating mirror directs the sunlight to the spectrograph lab located in the basement behind an earthen wall on the southern side of the tower. It is about 14 m long and thermally insulated. Here is where the light is split up into its spectral components and analyzed. This design of a horizontal laboratory wing led to the elongated profile of the entire facility.\nSoon after research started at the site, it became evident that the proof sought would be harder to obtain than originally anticipated since the minimal shift of spectral lines was obscured by other solar influences. The reason was atmospheric turbulence on the solar surface. However, Einstein and Freundlich had from the beginning not only been interested in the specific problem of the red shift, but had also intended basic research in solar physics, and the laboratories were so designed that new equipment could be installed without difficulty. The turbulent behavior of the outer solar atmosphere soon became the primary subject of research at the Einstein Tower. The red shift could be proved only in the 1950s after it became possible to precisely analyze the complex disturbances of the solar atmosphere.\n\n\n=== Present work ===\nThe characteristics and behavior of magnetic fields provide the key to understanding solar activity and are at the focus of work at the Einstein Tower. The solar magnetic field can be measured with the help of a double spectrograph and two photoelectric polarization analyzers. Measurements in the photosphere, the visible light realm, permit conclusions about the situation at higher altitude levels. The Potsdam astronomers participate in the operation of an observatory on Tenerife. Instruments to be used there are first developed and tested at the Einstein Tower. The Einstein Tower also plays an important role in training students.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Einstein Sculpture ===\nIn the tower\u2019s entrance area there is a bronze bust of Einstein which was originally located in one of the rooms of the observatory. After the Nazis' anti-Semitic dictatorship began in 1933, the Einstein Tower lost its name and status as an independent institute. Pictures of Einstein were removed and sculptures were supposedly melted down. However, after 1945 it was discovered that staff members had rescued the portrait bust now to be seen at the base of the tower by hiding it behind crates in the spectrograph lab. As a hidden homage to Einstein a single stone (German: 'ein Stein') was placed where the bust had stood, a tradition that is still kept (the stone is regularly stolen though and has to be replaced).\n\n\n=== The 3 SEC Bronze Brain ===\nA few meters in front of the stairs to the Einstein Tower and set into the pavement of the forecourt is a fist-sized art object, a bronze reproduction of a human brain highly reduced in size, its shiny surface a sign of wear, inscribed with the four characters, 3 SEC. It was created by the Berlin artist Volker M\u00e4rz, who placed it here and in an identical form in front of the Neurological Institute of the Charit\u00e9 in Berlin. The small sculpture refers to a scientific thesis of Ernst P\u00f6ppel according to which \"the experience of continuity is based on an illusion. Continuity arises through the networking of contents, which in each case are represented in a time window of three seconds. We reconstruct temporal continuity based on what is represented in the individual islands of consciousness\" (translation). Taking up this idea, M\u00e4rz titled his work \"the 3 SEC Bronze Brain \u2013 Admonition to the Now \u2013 Monument to the continuous present\" (translation).\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of solar telescopes\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nKlaus Hentschel: The Einstein Tower An Intertexture of Dynamic Construction, Relativity Theory, and Astronomy, Stanford University Press, Stanford 1997.\nPaul Sigel, Silke D\u00e4hmlow, Frank Seehausen and Lucas Elmenhorst: Architekturf\u00fchrer Potsdam - Architectural Guide, Dietrich Reimer Verlag, Berlin 2006, ISBN 3-496-01325-7.\nWolfschmidt, Gudrun; Cotte, Michel (2010). \"Case Study 12.5: The Einstein Tower, Potsdam, Germany\".

        "wiki": "The Picture Gallery (German: Bildergalerie) in the park of Sanssouci palace in Potsdam was built in 1755\u201364 during the reign of Frederick II of Prussia under the supervision of Johann Gottfried B\u00fcring. The Picture Gallery is situated east of the palace and is the oldest extant museum built for a ruler in Germany.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nFrederick II was a passionate collector of paintings. In his youth, he preferred the contemporary French art of the Rococo, and the walls of his rooms in Sanssouci were adorned with paintings of his favorite artist Antoine Watteau. After his accession to the throne in 1740, the king became increasingly interested in history paintings, which were highly regarded at his time. Especially, he collected works of renaissance, mannerism and Baroque art, mostly from Italian and Flemish artists. Due to the opening of the Altes Museum in Berlin in 1829, about fifty paintings were transferred there. Among these were the Leda by Correggio, three paintings by Rembrandt, some by Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, and Antoine Watteau. Also, all the marble statues were moved.\nIn 1929\u201330, the Picture Gallery was set up again, and 120 of the 159 works marked in the catalogue as purchased by Frederick returned from Berlin.\nDuring World War II, all the paintings were moved to Rheinsberg Palace in Rheinsberg. Only ten paintings returned from there in 1946, and most of the pictures seemed lost. However, a large collection of paintings confiscated by the Soviet Union was returned in 1958. However, some of the pictures are still in Russian collections.\n\n\n== Outside architecture ==\nThe Picture Gallery was built in the place of a former greenhouse, which Frederick the Great had used to raise tropical fruit. B\u00fcring replaced this with a long, single-story building painted in yellow, the middle part of which is emphasized by a dome. On the garden side, marble sculptures stand between the windows reaching down to the floor. Most of the sculptures were made by Johann Gottlieb Heym\u00fcller and Johann Peter Benckert, and depict allegorical figures from arts and sciences. The heads on the keystones show portraits of artists.\n\n\n== The gallery ==\nThe gallery hall is magnificently designed with richly gilded ornaments on the slightly curved ceiling. The floor is laid out in matching colors with a rhombic pattern of white and yellow Italian marble. On the green walls, the framed paintings are laid out densely above and alongside each other in a Baroque style. Some of the works exhibited are Caravaggio's Increduility of St Thomas, Anthony van Dycks Pentecost, and Four Evangelists and Saint Hieronymus from the workshop of Peter Paul Rubens.\nAdjacent to the long gallery hall is the similarly richly arranged cabinet, where the paintings of smaller format are exhibited.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\nThis article is based on a translation of the German Wikipedia article Bildergalerie, which cites the following references:Gert Streidt, Klaus Frahm.

        "wiki": "Potsdam (German pronunciation: [\u02c8p\u0254t\u0361sdam] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of the German federal state of Brandenburg. It directly borders the German capital, Berlin, and is part of the Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region. It is situated on the River Havel some 25 kilometres (16 miles) southwest of Berlin's city centre.\nPotsdam was a residence of the Prussian kings and the German Kaiser until 1918. Its planning embodied ideas of the Age of Enlightenment: through a careful balance of architecture and landscape, Potsdam was intended as \"a picturesque, pastoral dream\" which would remind its residents of their relationship with nature and reason.The city lies in an area of interconnected lakes and is distinguished by a series of cultural landmarks, in particular the parks and palaces of Sanssouci, the largest World Heritage Site in Germany. The Potsdam Conference in 1945 was held at Cecilienhof Palace.\nBabelsberg, in the south-eastern part of Potsdam, was already by the 1930s the home of a major film production studio and it has enjoyed success as an important center of European film production since the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Filmstudio Babelsberg is the oldest large-scale film studio in the world.Potsdam developed into a centre of science in Germany in the 19th century. Today, there are three public colleges, the University of Potsdam, and more than 30 research institutes in the city.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe area was formed from a series of large moraines left after the last glacial period. Today, only one quarter of the city is built up, the rest remaining as green space.\nThere are about 20 lakes and rivers in and around Potsdam, such as the Havel, the Griebnitzsee, Templiner See, Tiefer See, Jungfernsee, Teltowkanal, Heiliger See, and Sacrower See. The highest point is the 114-metre (374 ft) high Kleiner Ravensberg.\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\nPotsdam is divided into seven historic city Bezirke and nine new Stadtteile (villages), which joined the city in 2003. The appearance of the city quarters is quite different. Those in the north and in the centre consist mainly of historical buildings, the south of the city is dominated by larger areas of newer buildings.\nThe city of Potsdam is divided into 34 Stadtteile (or quarters), which are divided further into 84 statistical Bezirke.\nToday one distinguishes between the older parts of the city (areas of the historic city and places suburbanized at the latest in 1939) - these are the city center, the western and northern suburbs, Bornim, Bornstedt, Nedlitz, Potsdam South, Babelsberg, Drewitz, Stern and Kirchsteigfeld - and those communities incorporated after 1990 which have since 2003 become Stadtteile - these are Eiche, Fahrland, Golm, Gro\u00df Glienicke, Grube, Marquardt, Neu Fahrland, Satzkorn and Uetz-Paaren. The new Stadtteile are located mainly in the north of the city. For the history of all incorporations, see the relevant section on incorporation and spin-offs.\nStructure with statistical numbering:\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nOfficially the climate is oceanic - more degraded by being far from the coast and to the east (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), but using the 1961-1990 normal and the 0 \u00b0C isotherm the city has a humid continental climate (Dfb), which also shows a slight influence of the continent different from the climates predominantly influenced by the Atlantic Ocean. Low averages below freezing for almost all winter causing snows that are frequent and winters are cold, but not as stringent as inland locations or with greater influence from the same. Summer is also relatively warm with temperatures between 23 and 24 \u00b0C, the heat waves being influenced by the UHI of Potsdam.The average winter high temperature is 3.5 \u00b0C (38.3 \u00b0F), with a low of \u22121.7 \u00b0C (28.9 \u00b0F). Snow is common in the winter. Spring and autumn are short. Summers are mild, with a high of 23.6 \u00b0C (74.5 \u00b0F) and a low of 12.7 \u00b0C (54.9 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Potsdam\" originally seems to have been Poztupimi. A common theory is that it derives from an old West Slavonic term meaning \"beneath the oaks\", i.e., the corrupted pod dubmi/dubimi (pod \"beneath\", dub \"oak\"). However some question this explanation.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre- and early history ===\n\nThe area around Potsdam shows signs of occupancy since the Bronze Age and was part of Magna Germania as described by Tacitus. After the great migrations of the Germanic peoples, Slavs moved in and Potsdam was probably founded after the 7th century as a settlement of the Hevelli tribe centred on a castle. It was first mentioned in a document in 993 as Poztupimi, when Emperor Otto III gifted the territory to the Quedlinburg Abbey, then led by his aunt Matilda. By 1317, it was mentioned as a small town. It gained its town charter in 1345. In 1573, it was still a small market town of 2,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n=== Early modern era ===\nPotsdam lost nearly half of its population due to the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648).\nA continuous Hohenzollern possession since 1415, Potsdam became prominent, when it was chosen in 1660 as the hunting residence of Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg, the core of the powerful state that later became the Kingdom of Prussia. It also housed Prussian barracks.\n\nAfter the Edict of Potsdam in 1685, Potsdam became a centre of European immigration. Its religious freedom attracted people from France (Huguenots), Russia, the Netherlands and Bohemia. The edict accelerated population growth and economic recovery.\nLater, the city became a full residence of the Prussian royal family. The buildings of the royal residences were built mainly during the reign of Frederick the Great. One of these is the Sanssouci Palace (French: \"without cares\", by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff, 1744), famed for its formal gardens and Rococo interiors. Other royal residences include the New Palace and the Orangery.\nIn 1815, at the formation of the Province of Brandenburg, Potsdam became the provincial capital until 1918, except for a period between 1827 and 1843 when Berlin was the provincial capital (as it became once again after 1918). The province comprised two governorates named after their capitals Potsdam and Frankfurt (Oder).\n\n\n=== Governorate of Potsdam ===\n\nBetween 1815 and 1945, the city of Potsdam served as capital of the governorate of Potsdam (German: Regierungsbezirk Potsdam). The Regierungsbezirk encompassed the former districts of Uckermark, the Mark of Priegnitz, and the greater part of the Middle March. It was situated between Mecklenburg and the Province of Pomerania on the north, and the Province of Saxony on the south and west (Berlin, with a small surrounding district, was an urban governorate and enclave within the governorate of Potsdam between 1815 and 1822, then it merged as urban district into the governorate only to be disentangled again from Potsdam governorate in 1875, becoming a distinct province-like entity on 1 April 1881). Towards the north west the governorate was bounded by the rivers Elbe and the Havel, and on the north east by the Oder. The south eastern boundary was to the neighbouring governorate of Frankfurt (Oder). About 500,000 inhabitants lived in the Potsdam governorate, which covered an area of about 20,700 square kilometres (7,992 sq mi), divided into thirteen rural districts, partially named after their capitals:\nThe traditional towns in the governorate were small, however, in the course of the industrial labour migration some reached the rank of urban districts. The principal towns were Brandenburg upon Havel, K\u00f6penick, Potsdam, Prenzlau, Spandau and Ruppin. Until 1875 Berlin also was a town within the governorate. After its disentanglement a number of its suburbs outside Berlin's municipal borders grew to towns, many forming urban Bezirke within the governorate of Potsdam such as Charlottenburg, Lichtenberg, Rixdorf (after 1912 Neuk\u00f6lln), and Sch\u00f6neberg (all of which, as well as K\u00f6penick and Spandau, incorporated into Greater Berlin in 1920). The urban Bezirke were (years indicating the elevation to rank of urban Bezirkor affiliation with Potsdam governorate, respectively):\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nBerlin was the capital of Prussia and later of the German Empire, but the court remained in Potsdam, where many government officials settled. In 1914, Emperor Wilhelm II signed the Declaration of War in the Neues Palais (New Palace). The city lost its status as a \"second capital\" in 1918, when Wilhelm II abdicated and Germany became a Republic at the end of World War I.\nAt the start of the Third Reich in 1933 there was a ceremonial handshake between President Paul von Hindenburg and the new Chancellor Adolf Hitler on 21 March 1933 in Potsdam's Garrison Church in what became known as the \"Day of Potsdam\". This symbolised a coalition of the military (Reichswehr) and Nazism. Potsdam was severely damaged by Allied bombing raids during World War II.\n\nThe Cecilienhof Palace was the scene of the Potsdam Conference from 17 July to 2 August 1945, at which the victorious Allied leaders (Harry S. Truman; Winston Churchill and his successor, Clement Attlee; and Joseph Stalin) met to decide the future of Germany and postwar Europe in general. The conference ended with the Potsdam Agreement and the Potsdam Declaration.\n\nThe government of East Germany (formally known as the German Democratic Republic (German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik, DDR)) tried to remove symbols of \"Prussian militarism\". Many historic buildings, some of them badly damaged in the war, were demolished.\nWhen in 1946 the remainder of the Province of Brandenburg west of the Oder-Nei\u00dfe line was constituted as the state of Brandenburg, Potsdam became its capital. In 1952 the GDR disestablished its federal states and replaced them by smaller new East German administrative districts known as Bezirke. Potsdam became the capital of the new Bezirk Potsdam until 1990.\nPotsdam, south-west of Berlin, lay just outside West Berlin after the construction of the Berlin Wall. The walling off of West Berlin not only isolated Potsdam from West Berlin, but also doubled commuting times to East Berlin. The Glienicke Bridge across the Havel connected the city to West Berlin and was the scene of some Cold War exchanges of spies.\nAfter German reunification, Potsdam became the capital of the newly re-established state of Brandenburg. Since then there have been many ideas and efforts to reconstruct the original appearance of the city, including the Potsdam City Palace and the Garrison Church.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nSince 2000 Potsdam has been one of the fastest growing cities in Germany.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== International residents ===\n\nLargest groups of foreign residents:\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\n\n=== City government ===\nPotsdam has had a mayor (B\u00fcrgermeister) and city council since the 15th century. From 1809 the city council was elected, with a mayor (Oberb\u00fcrgermeister) at its head. During the Third Reich the mayor was selected by the NSDAP and the city council was dissolved; it was reconstituted in token form after 1945, but free elections did not take place until after reunification.\nToday, the city council is the city's central administrative authority. Local elections took place on 26 October 2003 and again in 2008. Between 1990 and 1999, the Chairman of the City Council was known as the \"Town President\" but today the post is the \"Chairman of the City Council\". The mayor is elected directly by the population.\n\n\n=== Brandenburg state government ===\nThe Landtag Brandenburg, the parliament of the federal state of Brandenburg is in Potsdam. It has been housed in the Potsdam City Palace since 2014.\n\n\n== Twin towns - sister cities ==\n\nPotsdam is twinned with:\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\n\n==== Rail transport ====\nPotsdam, included in the fare zone \"C\" (Tarifbereich C) of Berlin's public transport area and fare zones A and B of its own public transport area, is served by the S7 S-Bahn line. The stations served are Griebnitzsee, Babelsberg and the Central Station (Hauptbahnhof), the main and long-distance station of the city. Other DB stations in Potsdam are Charlottenhof, Park Sanssouci (including the monumental Kaiserbahnhof), Medienstadt Babelsberg, Rehbr\u00fccke, Pirschheide and Marquardt. The city also possesses a 27 km-long tramway network.\n\n\n==== Road transport ====\nPotsdam is served by several motorways: the A 10, a beltway better known as Berliner Ring, the A 115 (using part of the AVUS) and is closely linked to the A 2 and A 9. The B 1 and B 2 federal roads cross the city. Potsdam features a network of urban and suburban buses.\n\n\n== Education and research ==\n\nPotsdam is a university town. The University of Potsdam was founded in 1991 as a university of the State of Brandenburg. Its predecessor was the Akademie f\u00fcr Staats- und Rechtswissenschaften der DDR \"Walter Ulbricht\", a college of education founded in 1948 which was one of the GDR's most important colleges. There are about 20,000 students enrolled at the university.\n\nIn 1991 the Fachhochschule Potsdam was founded as the second college. It had 3,518 students as of 2017.Konrad Wolf Film University of Babelsberg (HFF), founded in 1954 in Babelsberg, is the foremost centre of the German film industry since its birth, with over 600 students.\nThere are also several research foundations, including Fraunhofer Institutes for Applied Polymer Research and Biomedical Engineering, Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute), Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces, and Max Planck Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology, the GFZ - German Research Centre for Geosciences, the Potsdam Astrophysical Institute, the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies, The Leibniz Institute for Agricultural Engineering and Bioeconomy and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, which employs 340 people in researching climate change.As well as universities, Potsdam is home to reputable secondary schools. Montessori Gesamtschule Potsdam, in western Potsdam, attracts 400 students from the Brandenburg and Berlin region.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nPotsdam was historically a centre of European immigration. Its religious tolerance attracted people from France, Russia, the Netherlands and Bohemia. This is still visible in the culture and architecture of the city.\nThe most popular attraction in Potsdam is Sanssouci Park, 2 km (1 mi) west of the city centre. In 1744 King Frederick the Great ordered the construction of a residence here, where he could live sans souci (\"without worries\", in the French spoken at the court). The park hosts a botanical garden (Botanical Garden, Potsdam) and many buildings:\n\nThe Sanssouci Palace (Schloss Sanssouci), a relatively modest palace of the Prussian royal (and later German imperial) family\nThe Orangery Palace (Orangerieschloss), former palace for foreign royal guests\nThe New Palace (Neues Palais), built between 1763 and 1769 to celebrate the end of the Seven Years' War, in which Prussia held off the combined attacks of Austria and Russia. It is a much larger and grander palace than Sanssouci, having over 200 rooms and 400 statues as decoration. It served as a guest house for numerous royal visitors. Today, it houses parts of University of Potsdam.\nThe Charlottenhof Palace (Schloss Charlottenhof), a Neoclassical palace by Karl Friedrich Schinkel built in 1826\nThe Roman Baths (R\u00f6mische B\u00e4der), built by Karl Friedrich Schinkel and Friedrich Ludwig Persius in 1829\u20131840. It is a complex of buildings including a tea pavilion, a Renaissance-style villa, and a Roman bathhouse (from which the whole complex takes its name).\nThe Chinese Tea House (Chinesisches Teehaus), an 18th-century pavilion built in a Chinese style, the fashion of the time.Three gates from the original city wall remain today. The oldest is the Hunters' Gate (J\u00e4gertor), built in 1733. The Nauener Tor was built in 1755 and close to the historic Dutch Quarter. The ornate Brandenburg Gate (built in 1770, not to be confused with the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin) is situated on the Luisenplatz at the western entrance to the old town.\n\nThe Old Market Square (Alter Markt) is Potsdam's historical city centre. For three centuries this was the site of the City Palace (Stadtschlo\u00df), a royal palace built in 1662. Under Frederick the Great, the palace became the winter residence of the Prussian kings. The palace was severely damaged by Allied bombing in 1945 and demolished in 1961 by the Communist authorities. In 2002 the Fortuna Gate (Fortunaportal) was rebuilt in its original historic position which was followed by a complete reconstruction of the palace as the Brandenburg Landtag building inaugurated in 2014. Nearby the square in the Humboldtstra\u00dfe block, which also was demolished after getting damaged in 1945, reconstructions of several representative residential palaces including Palazzo Pompei and Palazzo Barberini housing an arts museum were completed in 2016-2017 alongside buildings with modernized facades to restore the historical proportions of the block.\n\nThe Old Market Square is dominated today by the dome of St. Nicholas' Church (Nikolaikirche), built in 1837 in the Neoclassical style. It was the last work of Karl Friedrich Schinkel, who designed the building but did not live to see its completion. It was finished by his disciples Friedrich August St\u00fcler and Ludwig Persius. The eastern side of the Market Square is dominated by the Old City Hall (Altes Rathaus), built in 1755 by the Dutch architect Jan Bouman (1706\u20131776). It has a characteristic circular tower, crowned with a gilded Atlas bearing the world on his shoulders.\n\nNorth of the Old Market Square is the oval French Church (Franz\u00f6sische Kirche), erected in the 1750s by Boumann for the Huguenot community. To the south lies the Museum Barberini, a copy of the previous building, the Barberini Palace. The museum was funded by the German billionaire Hasso Plattner. The former Baroque building was built by Carl von Gontard in 1771\u20131772, inspired by the Renaissance palace Palazzo Barberini in Rome. The newly built museum was scheduled to open in spring 2017.\nAnother landmark of Potsdam is the two-street Dutch Quarter (Holl\u00e4ndisches Viertel), an ensemble of buildings that is unique in Europe, with about 150 houses built of red bricks in the Dutch style. It was built between 1734 and 1742 under the direction of Jan Bouman to be used by Dutch artisans and craftsmen who had been invited to settle here by King Frederick Wilhelm I. Today, this area is one of Potsdam's most visited quarters.\nNorth of the city centre is the Russian colony of Alexandrowka, a small enclave of Russian architecture (including an Orthodox chapel) built in 1825 for a group of Russian immigrants. Since 1999, the colony has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin.\nEast of the Alexandrowka colony is a large park, the New Garden (Neuer Garten), which was laid out from 1786 in the English style. The site contains two palaces; one of them, the Cecilienhof, was where the Potsdam Conference was held in July and August 1945. The Marmorpalais (Marble Palace) was built in 1789 in Neoclassical style. Nearby is the Biosph\u00e4re Potsdam, a tropical botanical garden.\nBabelsberg, a quarter south-east of the centre, houses the UFA film studios (Babelsberg Studios), and an extensive park with some historical buildings, including the Babelsberg Palace (Schlo\u00df Babelsberg, a Gothic revival palace designed by Schinkel).\nThe Einstein Tower is located within the Albert Einstein Science Park, which is on the top of the Telegraphenberg within an astronomy compound.\nPotsdam also features a memorial centre in the former KGB prison in Leistikowstra\u00dfe. In the Volkspark to the north, there is one of the last monuments dedicated to Lenin in Germany.\nPotsdam joined UNESCO's Network of Creative Cities as a Design City on October 31, 2019 on the occasion of World Cities\u2019 Day.\n\n\n== Parks ==\nThere are many parks in Potsdam, most of them UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

      "name": "Glienicke Bridge",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Glienicke Bridge (German: Glienicker Br\u00fccke, German pronunciation ) is a bridge across the Havel River in Germany, connecting the Wannsee district of Berlin with the Brandenburg capital Potsdam. It is named after nearby Glienicke Palace. The current bridge, the fourth on the site, was completed in 1907, although major reconstruction was necessary after it was damaged during World War II.During the Cold War, as this portion of the Havel River formed the border between West Berlin and East Germany, the bridge was used several times for the exchange of captured spies and thus became known as the Bridge of Spies.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe bridge spans the Havel narrows between the Jungfernsee (lake) to the north and the Glienicker Lake to the south. It carries the Bundesstra\u00dfe 1 highway. The Glienicke Palace and Jagdschloss Glienicke are situated (across the highway from each other) near the east (Berlin) end of the bridge. Potsdam tram route 93 from Potsdam main station and Berlin bus route 316 from Wannsee station terminate and interconnect at a tram stop on the Potsdam end of the bridge. The respective Potsdam and Wannsee stations are served by the Berlin S-Bahn and by longer distance trains.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nA first wooden bridge across the Havel River at this location was built about 1660, in order to reach the hunting grounds around Stolpe. By the early 1800s, a new, non-wooden bridge was needed to accommodate the massive increase in traffic on the chaussee between the Prussian capital Berlin and the Hohenzollern residence in Potsdam. The architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel designed a brick and wood bascule bridge, which was finished in 1834. By the early 20th century, Schinkel's bridge was no longer able to handle the increased volume in traffic, and operating the moveable sections of the bridge caused delays in steamer traffic on the Havel River.\nIn 1904, the Prussian government held a design competition to replace Schinkel's bridge with a modern, iron bridge. The Johann Caspar Harkort Company of Duisburg submitted the winning design, and the present-day bridge was inaugurated on 16 November 1907.\nThe German film studio UFA shot the film Unter den Br\u00fccken (Under the Bridges) at the Glienicke Bridge in 1944 and 1945. At the end of April 1945, an unexploded shell severely damaged the bridge. The reconstruction of the steel bridge was not completed until 1949, after the establishment of West Germany and East Germany. The East German government named it the \u201cBridge of Unity\" as the border between East Germany and Western Allied-occupied West Berlin ran across the middle of the bridge.\n\n\n=== Cold War ===\nDuring the early years of the Cold War, the bridge was mainly used by the Allies as a link between their Berlin sections and the military liaison missions in Potsdam. German residents of the two cities more frequently used the S-Bahn suburban rail to travel between Berlin and Potsdam. On 27 May 1952, East German authorities closed the bridge to citizens of West Berlin and West Germany. The bridge was closed to East German citizens after the construction of the Berlin Wall in August 1961. Only allied military personnel and foreign diplomats were allowed to access the bridge at any time.\nOf all the checkpoints between West Berlin and East Berlin, as well as those between West Berlin and East Germany, the Glienicke Bridge had the uniqueness of being the only such checkpoint of not only having a Soviet presence, but also of being under full Soviet control; all other checkpoints were under East German control, and had no Soviet presence.\nBy the 1970s, the bridge had outlived its projected lifespan and needed significant repairs. The cost of these repairs became a focus of a dispute between the government of West Berlin and the government of East Germany. In 1980 the West Berlin government repaired its half of the bridge, and in 1985 the West Berlin government paid for repairs to the East German half of the bridge in exchange for formally renaming the bridge \"Glienicke Bridge\" from \"Bridge of Unity.\"\nOn the evening of 10 November 1989, one day after the opening of the Berlin Wall, the Glienicke Bridge was reopened for pedestrians. Border fortifications and barricades were dismantled as a part of German reunification in 1990.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Bridge of Spies ===\nBecause the Glienicke Bridge was a restricted border crossing between the Eastern Bloc (namely Potsdam in East Germany) and territory affiliated with the Western powers (namely the American sector of West Berlin), the Americans and Soviets used it for the exchange of captured spies during the Cold War. Reporters began calling it the \"Bridge of Spies.\" When this name was later used as the title for various works, it was often taken to be a pun on \"bridge of sighs\" a name applied first to the bridge in Venice and then to others.The first prisoner exchange took place on 10 February 1962. The Americans released Rudolf Abel, convicted for spying for the Soviet Union in 1957, in exchange for Gary Powers, the pilot of a U-2 spy plane shot down in 1960.\nOn 12 June 1985, there was a swap of 23 American agents held in Eastern Europe for Polish agent Marian Zacharski and another three Soviet agents arrested in the West. The exchange was the result of three years of negotiation.The final exchange was also the most public. On 11 February 1986 the human rights campaigner (refusenik) and political prisoner Anatoly Shcharansky (now known as Natan Sharansky) and three Western agents were exchanged for Karl Koecher and four other Eastern agents.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nThe Glienicke bridge as a venue for prisoner exchange has appeared frequently in fiction, most notably in John Le Carr\u00e9's novel Smiley's People and the related BBC miniseries, as well as in the 1966 Harry Palmer film, Funeral in Berlin, based on the novel of the same name by Len Deighton.\nThe popular nickname 'Bridge of Spies' was used by the British band T'Pau as the name of the title track on their first album. The usage is metaphorical, referring to a 'walk to freedom' but in the context of a long-dreamt-of relationship.\nThe bridge is referenced in the children's TV series Codename: Kids Next Door, specifically when a bridge in a local mall is used to exchange a spy from the KND in return for a spy from the Teenagers, a parody of real-life prisoner exchanges.\nThere is a brief reference to the bridge in the sixth episode of the first season of Archer, when Mallory Archer and her long-time lover (and head of the KGB) Major Nikolai Jakov mention meeting there \"one moonlit night\" when they both worked on covert operations in Berlin, presumably during the Cold War.\nThe 2015 film Bridge of Spies, directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Hanks, features the Powers\u2013Abel prisoner exchange on the bridge as a major plot element.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nBridge of No Return\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPotsdam from Above - Glienicker Bruecke\nGlienicke Bridge at Structurae\n\"23rd Hour\" describes Glienicke Bridge in 1969\nThe House at the Bridge The history of the postwar kindergarten at the foot of the bridge",

        "wiki": "The New Chambers (German: Neue Kammern) is part of the ensemble of Sanssouci palace in Sanssouci Park, Potsdam, Germany. They were constructed for King Frederick the Great of Prussia from 1771 to 1775.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe building, which stands to the west of Sanssouci Palace, serves as a complement to the Picture Gallery, which lies to the east. Both buildings flank the summer palace.\nThe chambers replaced an orangery, which had been built at that site in 1745 on plans by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff and held the terraces' potted plants during the winter months. Ramps, on which the tubs were taken in and out, serve as reminders of the building's original use.\nMaster builder Georg Christian Unger was commissioned to turn the orangery building into a guesthouse.\nThe building's basic elements were left alone, as were its size and floor-to-ceiling french doors. The most obvious change was the addition of a cupola on the middle section. The similarities between the architecture of the New Chambers and that of the Picture Gallery are such that the both buildings can be mistaken for the other.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Interior ===\nThe real alteration occurred in the interior, where seven guest rooms and two ballrooms were created. The building is a highpoint of the late style of Frederican Rococo, even though Neoclassical style was already largely set as the prevailing taste of the period.\nThe guest rooms were decorated differently with lacquered, painted, or inlaid cabinets, whose costly inlays of native woods decorated the entire wall from the ceiling to the floor.\nFor paintings, the guest rooms have views of Potsdam, which document the town's design under Frederick the Great and were specially commissioned for the guesthouse by the king.\n\n\n=== The Jasper Room ===\n\nIn the middle of the building, under the cupola, lies the largest room, the Jasper Room.\nThe ballroom's walls are decorated with red jasper and grey Silesian marble. The same colors are found in the floor design. The ceiling painting Venus mit ihrem Gefolge (Venus with her Retinue) was created in 1774 by Johann Christoph Frisch.\nDecorated panels from both antiquity and the 18th century were attached to the background of red jasper.\n\n\n=== The Ovid Gallery ===\nThe second, large ballroom, located in the eastern part of the New Chambers is the Ovid Gallery, decorated in the style of French mirrored rooms.\nOn the long side of the room is a mirror stretching almost to the ceiling, across from which, on the garden side, are French doors.\nFrederick asked for the walls to be decorated with gilded reliefs of the liaisons of the ancient gods, which had been told of by the Roman poet Ovid in his Metamorphoses. The room's rich decoration comes from the workshop of the sculptors and brothers Johann David R\u00e4ntz and Johann Lorentz Wilhelm R\u00e4ntz.\n\n\n== World Heritage Site ==\nSince 1990 the palace and garden of Sanssouci including the New Chambers has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site, called Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nAdelheid Schendel, Jerzy Prrzyta\u0144ski: Die Neuen Kammern im Park Sanssouci.

        "wiki": "Potsdam (German pronunciation: [\u02c8p\u0254t\u0361sdam] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of the German federal state of Brandenburg. It directly borders the German capital, Berlin, and is part of the Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region. It is situated on the River Havel some 25 kilometres (16 miles) southwest of Berlin's city centre.\nPotsdam was a residence of the Prussian kings and the German Kaiser until 1918. Its planning embodied ideas of the Age of Enlightenment: through a careful balance of architecture and landscape, Potsdam was intended as \"a picturesque, pastoral dream\" which would remind its residents of their relationship with nature and reason.The city lies in an area of interconnected lakes and is distinguished by a series of cultural landmarks, in particular the parks and palaces of Sanssouci, the largest World Heritage Site in Germany. The Potsdam Conference in 1945 was held at Cecilienhof Palace.\nBabelsberg, in the south-eastern part of Potsdam, was already by the 1930s the home of a major film production studio and it has enjoyed success as an important center of European film production since the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Filmstudio Babelsberg is the oldest large-scale film studio in the world.Potsdam developed into a centre of science in Germany in the 19th century. Today, there are three public colleges, the University of Potsdam, and more than 30 research institutes in the city.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe area was formed from a series of large moraines left after the last glacial period. Today, only one quarter of the city is built up, the rest remaining as green space.\nThere are about 20 lakes and rivers in and around Potsdam, such as the Havel, the Griebnitzsee, Templiner See, Tiefer See, Jungfernsee, Teltowkanal, Heiliger See, and Sacrower See. The highest point is the 114-metre (374 ft) high Kleiner Ravensberg.\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\nPotsdam is divided into seven historic city Bezirke and nine new Stadtteile (villages), which joined the city in 2003. The appearance of the city quarters is quite different. Those in the north and in the centre consist mainly of historical buildings, the south of the city is dominated by larger areas of newer buildings.\nThe city of Potsdam is divided into 34 Stadtteile (or quarters), which are divided further into 84 statistical Bezirke.\nToday one distinguishes between the older parts of the city (areas of the historic city and places suburbanized at the latest in 1939) - these are the city center, the western and northern suburbs, Bornim, Bornstedt, Nedlitz, Potsdam South, Babelsberg, Drewitz, Stern and Kirchsteigfeld - and those communities incorporated after 1990 which have since 2003 become Stadtteile - these are Eiche, Fahrland, Golm, Gro\u00df Glienicke, Grube, Marquardt, Neu Fahrland, Satzkorn and Uetz-Paaren. The new Stadtteile are located mainly in the north of the city. For the history of all incorporations, see the relevant section on incorporation and spin-offs.\nStructure with statistical numbering:\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nOfficially the climate is oceanic - more degraded by being far from the coast and to the east (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), but using the 1961-1990 normal and the 0 \u00b0C isotherm the city has a humid continental climate (Dfb), which also shows a slight influence of the continent different from the climates predominantly influenced by the Atlantic Ocean. Low averages below freezing for almost all winter causing snows that are frequent and winters are cold, but not as stringent as inland locations or with greater influence from the same. Summer is also relatively warm with temperatures between 23 and 24 \u00b0C, the heat waves being influenced by the UHI of Potsdam.The average winter high temperature is 3.5 \u00b0C (38.3 \u00b0F), with a low of \u22121.7 \u00b0C (28.9 \u00b0F). Snow is common in the winter. Spring and autumn are short. Summers are mild, with a high of 23.6 \u00b0C (74.5 \u00b0F) and a low of 12.7 \u00b0C (54.9 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Potsdam\" originally seems to have been Poztupimi. A common theory is that it derives from an old West Slavonic term meaning \"beneath the oaks\", i.e., the corrupted pod dubmi/dubimi (pod \"beneath\", dub \"oak\"). However some question this explanation.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre- and early history ===\n\nThe area around Potsdam shows signs of occupancy since the Bronze Age and was part of Magna Germania as described by Tacitus. After the great migrations of the Germanic peoples, Slavs moved in and Potsdam was probably founded after the 7th century as a settlement of the Hevelli tribe centred on a castle. It was first mentioned in a document in 993 as Poztupimi, when Emperor Otto III gifted the territory to the Quedlinburg Abbey, then led by his aunt Matilda. By 1317, it was mentioned as a small town. It gained its town charter in 1345. In 1573, it was still a small market town of 2,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n=== Early modern era ===\nPotsdam lost nearly half of its population due to the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648).\nA continuous Hohenzollern possession since 1415, Potsdam became prominent, when it was chosen in 1660 as the hunting residence of Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg, the core of the powerful state that later became the Kingdom of Prussia. It also housed Prussian barracks.\n\nAfter the Edict of Potsdam in 1685, Potsdam became a centre of European immigration. Its religious freedom attracted people from France (Huguenots), Russia, the Netherlands and Bohemia. The edict accelerated population growth and economic recovery.\nLater, the city became a full residence of the Prussian royal family. The buildings of the royal residences were built mainly during the reign of Frederick the Great. One of these is the Sanssouci Palace (French: \"without cares\", by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff, 1744), famed for its formal gardens and Rococo interiors. Other royal residences include the New Palace and the Orangery.\nIn 1815, at the formation of the Province of Brandenburg, Potsdam became the provincial capital until 1918, except for a period between 1827 and 1843 when Berlin was the provincial capital (as it became once again after 1918). The province comprised two governorates named after their capitals Potsdam and Frankfurt (Oder).\n\n\n=== Governorate of Potsdam ===\n\nBetween 1815 and 1945, the city of Potsdam served as capital of the governorate of Potsdam (German: Regierungsbezirk Potsdam). The Regierungsbezirk encompassed the former districts of Uckermark, the Mark of Priegnitz, and the greater part of the Middle March. It was situated between Mecklenburg and the Province of Pomerania on the north, and the Province of Saxony on the south and west (Berlin, with a small surrounding district, was an urban governorate and enclave within the governorate of Potsdam between 1815 and 1822, then it merged as urban district into the governorate only to be disentangled again from Potsdam governorate in 1875, becoming a distinct province-like entity on 1 April 1881). Towards the north west the governorate was bounded by the rivers Elbe and the Havel, and on the north east by the Oder. The south eastern boundary was to the neighbouring governorate of Frankfurt (Oder). About 500,000 inhabitants lived in the Potsdam governorate, which covered an area of about 20,700 square kilometres (7,992 sq mi), divided into thirteen rural districts, partially named after their capitals:\nThe traditional towns in the governorate were small, however, in the course of the industrial labour migration some reached the rank of urban districts. The principal towns were Brandenburg upon Havel, K\u00f6penick, Potsdam, Prenzlau, Spandau and Ruppin. Until 1875 Berlin also was a town within the governorate. After its disentanglement a number of its suburbs outside Berlin's municipal borders grew to towns, many forming urban Bezirke within the governorate of Potsdam such as Charlottenburg, Lichtenberg, Rixdorf (after 1912 Neuk\u00f6lln), and Sch\u00f6neberg (all of which, as well as K\u00f6penick and Spandau, incorporated into Greater Berlin in 1920). The urban Bezirke were (years indicating the elevation to rank of urban Bezirkor affiliation with Potsdam governorate, respectively):\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nBerlin was the capital of Prussia and later of the German Empire, but the court remained in Potsdam, where many government officials settled. In 1914, Emperor Wilhelm II signed the Declaration of War in the Neues Palais (New Palace). The city lost its status as a \"second capital\" in 1918, when Wilhelm II abdicated and Germany became a Republic at the end of World War I.\nAt the start of the Third Reich in 1933 there was a ceremonial handshake between President Paul von Hindenburg and the new Chancellor Adolf Hitler on 21 March 1933 in Potsdam's Garrison Church in what became known as the \"Day of Potsdam\". This symbolised a coalition of the military (Reichswehr) and Nazism. Potsdam was severely damaged by Allied bombing raids during World War II.\n\nThe Cecilienhof Palace was the scene of the Potsdam Conference from 17 July to 2 August 1945, at which the victorious Allied leaders (Harry S. Truman; Winston Churchill and his successor, Clement Attlee; and Joseph Stalin) met to decide the future of Germany and postwar Europe in general. The conference ended with the Potsdam Agreement and the Potsdam Declaration.\n\nThe government of East Germany (formally known as the German Democratic Republic (German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik, DDR)) tried to remove symbols of \"Prussian militarism\". Many historic buildings, some of them badly damaged in the war, were demolished.\nWhen in 1946 the remainder of the Province of Brandenburg west of the Oder-Nei\u00dfe line was constituted as the state of Brandenburg, Potsdam became its capital. In 1952 the GDR disestablished its federal states and replaced them by smaller new East German administrative districts known as Bezirke. Potsdam became the capital of the new Bezirk Potsdam until 1990.\nPotsdam, south-west of Berlin, lay just outside West Berlin after the construction of the Berlin Wall. The walling off of West Berlin not only isolated Potsdam from West Berlin, but also doubled commuting times to East Berlin. The Glienicke Bridge across the Havel connected the city to West Berlin and was the scene of some Cold War exchanges of spies.\nAfter German reunification, Potsdam became the capital of the newly re-established state of Brandenburg. Since then there have been many ideas and efforts to reconstruct the original appearance of the city, including the Potsdam City Palace and the Garrison Church.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nSince 2000 Potsdam has been one of the fastest growing cities in Germany.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== International residents ===\n\nLargest groups of foreign residents:\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\n\n=== City government ===\nPotsdam has had a mayor (B\u00fcrgermeister) and city council since the 15th century. From 1809 the city council was elected, with a mayor (Oberb\u00fcrgermeister) at its head. During the Third Reich the mayor was selected by the NSDAP and the city council was dissolved; it was reconstituted in token form after 1945, but free elections did not take place until after reunification.\nToday, the city council is the city's central administrative authority. Local elections took place on 26 October 2003 and again in 2008. Between 1990 and 1999, the Chairman of the City Council was known as the \"Town President\" but today the post is the \"Chairman of the City Council\". The mayor is elected directly by the population.\n\n\n=== Brandenburg state government ===\nThe Landtag Brandenburg, the parliament of the federal state of Brandenburg is in Potsdam. It has been housed in the Potsdam City Palace since 2014.\n\n\n== Twin towns - sister cities ==\n\nPotsdam is twinned with:\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\n\n==== Rail transport ====\nPotsdam, included in the fare zone \"C\" (Tarifbereich C) of Berlin's public transport area and fare zones A and B of its own public transport area, is served by the S7 S-Bahn line. The stations served are Griebnitzsee, Babelsberg and the Central Station (Hauptbahnhof), the main and long-distance station of the city. Other DB stations in Potsdam are Charlottenhof, Park Sanssouci (including the monumental Kaiserbahnhof), Medienstadt Babelsberg, Rehbr\u00fccke, Pirschheide and Marquardt. The city also possesses a 27 km-long tramway network.\n\n\n==== Road transport ====\nPotsdam is served by several motorways: the A 10, a beltway better known as Berliner Ring, the A 115 (using part of the AVUS) and is closely linked to the A 2 and A 9. The B 1 and B 2 federal roads cross the city. Potsdam features a network of urban and suburban buses.\n\n\n== Education and research ==\n\nPotsdam is a university town. The University of Potsdam was founded in 1991 as a university of the State of Brandenburg. Its predecessor was the Akademie f\u00fcr Staats- und Rechtswissenschaften der DDR \"Walter Ulbricht\", a college of education founded in 1948 which was one of the GDR's most important colleges. There are about 20,000 students enrolled at the university.\n\nIn 1991 the Fachhochschule Potsdam was founded as the second college. It had 3,518 students as of 2017.Konrad Wolf Film University of Babelsberg (HFF), founded in 1954 in Babelsberg, is the foremost centre of the German film industry since its birth, with over 600 students.\nThere are also several research foundations, including Fraunhofer Institutes for Applied Polymer Research and Biomedical Engineering, Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute), Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces, and Max Planck Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology, the GFZ - German Research Centre for Geosciences, the Potsdam Astrophysical Institute, the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies, The Leibniz Institute for Agricultural Engineering and Bioeconomy and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, which employs 340 people in researching climate change.As well as universities, Potsdam is home to reputable secondary schools. Montessori Gesamtschule Potsdam, in western Potsdam, attracts 400 students from the Brandenburg and Berlin region.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nPotsdam was historically a centre of European immigration. Its religious tolerance attracted people from France, Russia, the Netherlands and Bohemia. This is still visible in the culture and architecture of the city.\nThe most popular attraction in Potsdam is Sanssouci Park, 2 km (1 mi) west of the city centre. In 1744 King Frederick the Great ordered the construction of a residence here, where he could live sans souci (\"without worries\", in the French spoken at the court). The park hosts a botanical garden (Botanical Garden, Potsdam) and many buildings:\n\nThe Sanssouci Palace (Schloss Sanssouci), a relatively modest palace of the Prussian royal (and later German imperial) family\nThe Orangery Palace (Orangerieschloss), former palace for foreign royal guests\nThe New Palace (Neues Palais), built between 1763 and 1769 to celebrate the end of the Seven Years' War, in which Prussia held off the combined attacks of Austria and Russia. It is a much larger and grander palace than Sanssouci, having over 200 rooms and 400 statues as decoration. It served as a guest house for numerous royal visitors. Today, it houses parts of University of Potsdam.\nThe Charlottenhof Palace (Schloss Charlottenhof), a Neoclassical palace by Karl Friedrich Schinkel built in 1826\nThe Roman Baths (R\u00f6mische B\u00e4der), built by Karl Friedrich Schinkel and Friedrich Ludwig Persius in 1829\u20131840. It is a complex of buildings including a tea pavilion, a Renaissance-style villa, and a Roman bathhouse (from which the whole complex takes its name).\nThe Chinese Tea House (Chinesisches Teehaus), an 18th-century pavilion built in a Chinese style, the fashion of the time.Three gates from the original city wall remain today. The oldest is the Hunters' Gate (J\u00e4gertor), built in 1733. The Nauener Tor was built in 1755 and close to the historic Dutch Quarter. The ornate Brandenburg Gate (built in 1770, not to be confused with the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin) is situated on the Luisenplatz at the western entrance to the old town.\n\nThe Old Market Square (Alter Markt) is Potsdam's historical city centre. For three centuries this was the site of the City Palace (Stadtschlo\u00df), a royal palace built in 1662. Under Frederick the Great, the palace became the winter residence of the Prussian kings. The palace was severely damaged by Allied bombing in 1945 and demolished in 1961 by the Communist authorities. In 2002 the Fortuna Gate (Fortunaportal) was rebuilt in its original historic position which was followed by a complete reconstruction of the palace as the Brandenburg Landtag building inaugurated in 2014. Nearby the square in the Humboldtstra\u00dfe block, which also was demolished after getting damaged in 1945, reconstructions of several representative residential palaces including Palazzo Pompei and Palazzo Barberini housing an arts museum were completed in 2016-2017 alongside buildings with modernized facades to restore the historical proportions of the block.\n\nThe Old Market Square is dominated today by the dome of St. Nicholas' Church (Nikolaikirche), built in 1837 in the Neoclassical style. It was the last work of Karl Friedrich Schinkel, who designed the building but did not live to see its completion. It was finished by his disciples Friedrich August St\u00fcler and Ludwig Persius. The eastern side of the Market Square is dominated by the Old City Hall (Altes Rathaus), built in 1755 by the Dutch architect Jan Bouman (1706\u20131776). It has a characteristic circular tower, crowned with a gilded Atlas bearing the world on his shoulders.\n\nNorth of the Old Market Square is the oval French Church (Franz\u00f6sische Kirche), erected in the 1750s by Boumann for the Huguenot community. To the south lies the Museum Barberini, a copy of the previous building, the Barberini Palace. The museum was funded by the German billionaire Hasso Plattner. The former Baroque building was built by Carl von Gontard in 1771\u20131772, inspired by the Renaissance palace Palazzo Barberini in Rome. The newly built museum was scheduled to open in spring 2017.\nAnother landmark of Potsdam is the two-street Dutch Quarter (Holl\u00e4ndisches Viertel), an ensemble of buildings that is unique in Europe, with about 150 houses built of red bricks in the Dutch style. It was built between 1734 and 1742 under the direction of Jan Bouman to be used by Dutch artisans and craftsmen who had been invited to settle here by King Frederick Wilhelm I. Today, this area is one of Potsdam's most visited quarters.\nNorth of the city centre is the Russian colony of Alexandrowka, a small enclave of Russian architecture (including an Orthodox chapel) built in 1825 for a group of Russian immigrants. Since 1999, the colony has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin.\nEast of the Alexandrowka colony is a large park, the New Garden (Neuer Garten), which was laid out from 1786 in the English style. The site contains two palaces; one of them, the Cecilienhof, was where the Potsdam Conference was held in July and August 1945. The Marmorpalais (Marble Palace) was built in 1789 in Neoclassical style. Nearby is the Biosph\u00e4re Potsdam, a tropical botanical garden.\nBabelsberg, a quarter south-east of the centre, houses the UFA film studios (Babelsberg Studios), and an extensive park with some historical buildings, including the Babelsberg Palace (Schlo\u00df Babelsberg, a Gothic revival palace designed by Schinkel).\nThe Einstein Tower is located within the Albert Einstein Science Park, which is on the top of the Telegraphenberg within an astronomy compound.\nPotsdam also features a memorial centre in the former KGB prison in Leistikowstra\u00dfe. In the Volkspark to the north, there is one of the last monuments dedicated to Lenin in Germany.\nPotsdam joined UNESCO's Network of Creative Cities as a Design City on October 31, 2019 on the occasion of World Cities\u2019 Day.\n\n\n== Parks ==\nThere are many parks in Potsdam, most of them UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Among their attractions are:\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Sports ==\n1.

        "wiki": "The Protestant Church of Peace (German: Friedenskirche) is situated in the Marly Gardens on the Green Fence (Am Gr\u00fcnen Gitter) in the palace grounds of Sanssouci Park in Potsdam, Germany. The church was built according to the wishes and with the close involvement of the artistically gifted King Frederick William IV and designed by the court architect, Ludwig Persius. After Persius' death in 1845, the architect Friedrich August St\u00fcler was charged with continuing his work. Building included work by Ferdinand von Arnim and Ludwig Ferdinand Hesse also. The church is located in the area covered by the UNESCO World Heritage Site Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin.\nThe cornerstone of the churchhouse was laid on 14 April 1845. The building was dedicated on 24 September 1848, though construction continued until 1854. The structure resembles a High Medieval Italian monastery.\n\n\n== The Church of Peace ==\nFrederick William himself made the original sketches on which the design was to be based. He gave his court architect Ludwig Persius two main instructions: The church was to derive in form and size from the early Christian Basilica di San Clemente in Rome. And it had to accommodate the apse mosaic from the church San Cipriano on the island of Murano in the Venetian Lagoon, which Frederick William had purchased in 1834 when that church was scheduled for demolition. A popular etching of the early Christian version of the Basilica di San Clemente in Rome made by Johann Gottfried Gutensohn and Johann Michael Knapp probably inspired the design of the Potsdam church.Under Frederick William, the church served as the chapel royal and as church for the parish of Brandenburger Vorstadt (a part of Potsdam).The church is a columned basilica with three naves and no transept, with a free-standing belltower. The 13.5 m high central nave overlaps the side aisles, which are half as wide. An arcade of central arches mark the crossing point. \nThe religious Frederick William IV desired a flat coffered ceiling on the inside, with gold stars on a blue base painted on the panels. \nThe king saw the design of early Christian sacred buildings, converted from market and court halls, as particularly appropriate. He was trying to establish a reconciliation between the Protestant majority of the original Prussian state and the Catholics of the more recently acquired lands, notably in the Rhineland Province. Since he associated Gothic architecture with the Catholic faith, he was looking for an alternative design vocabulary for the Prussian-Protestant church. Skipping Martin Luther, he went back to early Christianity as an inspiration. However, he did not distinguish too finely between early Christian and High Medieval architecture - as long as it was Romanesque.An original Venetian mosaic from the early 13th century decorates the church's apse. While he was crown prince Frederick William had it bought at auction for 385 thalers and brought to Potsdam by boat. The mosaic shows the enthroned Christ with the Book of Life, the right hand upheld in blessing. At each side stand Mary and John the Baptist. Next to them stand the apostle Peter and Saint Cyprian, martyred by beheading in 258 and patron saint of Saint Cipriana, wearing chasubles. As an allegory for the Holy Spirit, a pigeon decorates the vertex of the hemisphere. Over the heads of the archangels Raphael and Michael a lamb shines as a symbol of Christ. On the semicircle of the apse a Latin inscript reads, according to Martin Luther's translation: \"Lord, I have love for the site of your house and the place where your glory resides\".\nThe altar canopy, which rests on four dark green columns, was created from Siberian jasper (semi-precious stones) and was a gift from Tsar Nicholas I of Russia, the king's brother in law. It was installed in the Church of Peace in 1842.\nIn the right-hand aisle lies the former baptistery. The six-sided baptismal stone was relocated in 1965.\nThe counterpart to the baptistery is the sacristy in the left-hand aisle. After the death of Frederick William IV it was used temporarily as a mausoleum for him and for other deceased members of the House of Hohenzollern. The son of Emperor Friedrich III and his wife Empress Victoria, as well as the Princes Sigismund and Waldemar, were entombed here until 1892. In 1920 the youngest son of Wilhelm II, the last Emperor of Germany, was interred  in the sacristy. After 1931 he was moved to the Antique Temple.\nUnder two marble tablets, embedded in the ground in front of the steps of the altar room, the royal crypt can be found. Frederick William IV died following several strokes on 2 January 1861, and following the dedication of the crypt in October 1864 his coffin was placed there. The heart of the king, however, rests in the mausoleum of Charlottenburg Palace in Berlin. He was laid in the ground at the feet of his parents, King Frederick William III and Queen Louise.\nIn 1873 his wife Elisabeth Ludovika followed him to the grave. Both coffins, made out of English tin, carry the same inscript as the marble plates in the church floor: \"Here he rests in God, his Redeemer, in the hope of resurrection in the soul and a merciful judgement, justified solely by the service of Jesus Christ our most holy Saviour and Only Life\".\nIn the year of the crypt's dedication, the flooring of the church was completed as Frederick William IV had wished; the design is an intricately interleaved endless ribbon which represents eternity.\nThe free-standing, 42 m high campanile (belltower), on the southern side, is based on the design of the campanile of Santa Maria in Cosmedin in Rome. An aedicula (column-bearing dais) on the east side bears the fresco \"Jesus in Gethsemane\" by Eduard Steinbr\u00fcck. The tower has seven open floors. The four bells, named Gratia, Clementia, Pax and Gloria, sound from the third floor above the clockwork. In 1917 and 1945 they were all taken from the tower to be melted down for the war effort, but escaped this unhappy fate.\nAn open porch (narthex) across the western side of the portal opens into an inner courtyard (atrium). The larger-than-life statue of Christ on the fountain is a copy of the marble original, created in 1821 by Bertel Thorvaldsen, in the Copenhagen Church of Our Lady. The ancient Greek inscript on the edge of the fountain reads: \"Cleanse thyself of thy sins and not just thy face\". An arcade surrounds the inner courtyard.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Kaiser Friedrich Mausoleum ==\n\nThe Kaiser Friedrich Mausoleum was added to the north side between 1888 and 1890. The plans were drawn up by Julius Carl Raschdorff, who also designed the Berlin Cathedral from 1893 to 1905, in the style of the Baroque-influenced Italian High Renaissance. The 17th century Chapel of the Holy Tomb in Innichen, South Tyrol, Italy serves as an archetype for the mausoleum.\nThe mausoleum is a domed structure with an oval outline and an attached rectangular altar room. The inside contains a surrounding gallery and the domed roof, supported by two black columns, one on top of the other, which run around the edge. A golden mosaic on the inside of the roof shows alternating angels and palm trees.\nIn the middle of the rotunda stands the marble sarcophagus of German Emperor Friedrich III and his wife Empress Victoria, formerly Princess Royal of Great Britain and Ireland. The effigies were executed by Reinhold Begas, who also completed the sarcophagi which stand on the side walls of the altar room and contain the remains of Prince Sigismund (1864\u20131866) and Prince Waldemar (1868\u20131879), sons of the imperial couple who both died at a young age; they were transferred into the mausoleum from the Church of Peace.\nSince 1991, the plain coffin of the Soldier-King Frederick William I has stood on the steps to the altar. Originally entombed in the now destroyed Garrison Church in Potsdam, like his son Frederick the Great, the coffin was moved shortly before the end of the war in 1945. Until 1953 it lay in the Elisabeth Church in Marburg, Hesse, and until 1991 in Burg Hohenzollern at Hechingen, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The original black marble sarcophagus was destroyed in 1945, and the current one is a copy made from copper.\n\n\n== Heilsbronn Porch ==\n\nA marble relief in the south part of the arcade is the last work of the sculptor Christian Daniel Rauch. It shows \"Moses in prayer, supported by the high priests Aaron and Hur\".\nParallel to the southern arcade runs the cloister with the Heilsbronn Porch, an entrance to the Marly Gardens. It is a replica of a Roman tiered porch at the former refectory in the Heilsbronn Cloister in Middle Franconia, which caught the eye of the architect Ludwig Ferdinand Hesse while he was on a study trip in 1828. He instructed the Berlin potter Tobias Feilner to imitate the entrance in reddish terracotta. Frederick William IV explicitly rejected Hesse's suggestion to incorporate the copy, but Hesse nonetheless had the porch installed two years after the king's death. The original from the Heilsbronn Cloister was brought to the National Germanic Museum in Nuremberg, where it was almost entirely destroyed at the end of the Second World War in 1945.\n\n\n== Adjacent buildings and gates ==\nTo the south, along the length of the bell tower, stretches the Cavalier's House, a former guest house. Adjoining it is the Porter's House with its short tower and in the right-hand nook is the Rector's and Schoolhouse.\nFrederick William IV had two entrances to the park created for the congregation. One a low auxiliary gate built near the Green Fence. Through it visitors arrive with \"reverentially bowed posture\" onto the grounds of the Church of Peace.\nA second entrance, that is no longer used today, lies on the eastern edge of the park, near the Obelisk. The Gate of Three Kings was created by Ludwig Ferdinand Hesse in the classical style and shows sculptures of Kings David, Solomon and Charlemagne.\n\n\n== The park grounds ==\nWith the eastern outskirts of the park Frederick William IV wanted to create, among others, a connection between the park and the city. In the Marly Gardens, the kitchen garden of the soldier-king Frederick William I, a place of tranquility was created. The garden architect Peter Joseph Lenn\u00e9 embedded the group of buildings in an attractive park with two distinct gardens.\nThe Garden of Peace, on the side of the city in the east, is planted with small groups of trees and bushes laid out and contains the Pool of Peace. The water plays around the church building on the north and east sides. The Marly Gardens, only three hectares in area, adjoins the site of the church on the west. The compact planting of groups of trees and bushes, access balconies, flower beds and sculptures reflect a picture of romantic playfulness.\n\n\n== Current state ==\nAs of 2015, various parts of the church were in need of repair. The Campanile has already required emergency stabilisation work. The Venetian mosaic is also at risk. The iron parts of the construction underlying the mosaic (imported in its original mortar setting) are rusting. In addition, the roofs of the side aisles are leaking, allowing water to seep into the walls.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChurch of the Redeemer, Sacrow\n\n\n== References ==\nPEDA-Kunstf\u00fchrer: Die Friedenskirche zu Potsdam-Sanssouci.

        "wiki": "Charlottenburg Palace (German: Schloss Charlottenburg) is a Baroque palace in Berlin, located in Charlottenburg, a district of the Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf borough.\nThe palace was built at the end of the 17th century and was greatly expanded during the 18th century. It includes much lavish internal decoration in baroque and rococo styles. A large formal garden surrounded by woodland was added behind the palace, including a belvedere, a mausoleum, a theatre and a pavilion. During the Second World War, the palace was badly damaged but has since been reconstructed. The palace with its gardens are a major tourist attraction.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Palace ===\n\nThe original palace was commissioned by Sophie Charlotte, the wife of Friedrich I, Elector of Brandenburg in what was then the village of Lietzow. Named Lietzenburg, the palace was designed by Johann Arnold Nering in baroque style. It consisted of one wing and was built in \u200b2 1\u20442 storeys with a central cupola. The fa\u00e7ade was decorated with Corinthian pilasters. On the top was a cornice on which were statues. At the rear in the centre of the palace were two oval halls, the upper one being a ceremonial hall and the lower giving access to the gardens. Nering died during the construction of the palace and the work was completed by Martin Gr\u00fcnberg and Andreas Schl\u00fcter. The inauguration of the palace was celebrated on 11 July 1699, Frederick's 42nd birthday.Friedrich crowned himself as King Friedrich I in Prussia in 1701 (Friedrich II, known as Frederick the Great, would later achieve the title King of Prussia). Two years previously, he had appointed Johann Friedrich von Eosander (also known as Eosander von G\u00f6the) as the royal architect and sent him to study architectural developments in Italy and France, particularly the Palace of Versailles. On his return in 1702, Eosander began to extend the palace, starting with two side wings to enclose a large courtyard, and the main palace was extended on both sides. Sophie Charlotte died in 1705 and Friedrich named the palace and its estate Charlottenburg in her memory. In the following years, the Orangery was built on the west of the palace and the central area was extended with a large domed tower and a larger vestibule. On top of the dome is a wind vane in the form of a gilded statue representing Fortune designed by Andreas Heidt. The Orangery was originally used to overwinter rare plants. During the summer months, when over 500 orange, citrus and sour orange trees decorated the baroque garden, the Orangery regularly was the gorgeous scene of courtly festivities.\n\nVarious artists were invited to decorate the interior of the palace.  As the court painter of Friedrich I, the Flemish artist Jan Anthonie Coxie was commissioned to paint the walls and ceilings in various rooms of the palace. Coxie painted between 1701 and 1713 frescos and an altarpiece in the Palace Chapel and frescos in the Gobelin Gallery and Porcelain Room.  The frescos in the Porcelain Room were blatant propaganda for the glorious rule of Friedrich I.  They represent Aurora, the Goddess of Dawn, in her seven-horsed chariot chasing away Night and clearing the way for the Sun-God Apollo, who approaches in his chariot in a blaze of light. Hovering overhead, Mercury heralds the arrival of the life-giving god and Saturn ushers in the Golden Age with his scythe.  Coxie also included images of the Four Continents as well as the Four Seasons, which are familiar allusions to political power and thus affirm the greatness of Friedrich I.Inside the palace, was a room described as \"the eighth wonder of the world\", the Amber Room (Bernsteinzimmer), a room with its walls surfaced in decorative amber. It was designed by Andreas Schl\u00fcter, and its construction by the Danish amber craftsman Gottfried Wolfram started in 1701. Friedrich Wilhelm I gave the Amber Room to Tsar Peter the Great as a present in 1716.\n\nWhen Friedrich I died in 1713, he was succeeded by his son, Friedrich Wilhelm I whose building plans were less ambitious, although he did ensure that the building was properly maintained. Building was resumed after his son Friedrich II (Frederick the Great) came to the throne in 1740. During that year, stables for his personal guard regiment were completed to the south of the Orangery wing and work was started on the east wing. The building of the new wing was supervised by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff, the superintendent of all the Royal Palaces, who largely followed Eosander's design. The decoration of the exterior was relatively simple but the interior furnishings were rich with painting and sculpture, textiles, and mirrors. The ground floor was intended for Frederick's wife Elisabeth Christine, who, preferring Sch\u00f6nhausen Palace however, was only an occasional visitor. The especially splendid decoration of the upper floor, which included the White Hall, the Banqueting Hall, the Throne Room and the Golden Gallery, was designed mainly by Johann August Nahl. In 1747, a second apartment for the king was prepared in the distant eastern part of the wing. During this time, Sanssouci was being built at Potsdam, and once this was completed Frederick was only an occasional visitor to Charlottenburg.In 1786, Frederick was succeeded by his nephew Friedrich Wilhelm II, who transformed five rooms on the ground floor of the east wing into his summer quarters and part of the upper floor into Winter Chambers, although he did not live long enough to use them. His son, Friedrich Wilhelm III, came to the throne in 1797 and reigned with his wife, Queen Luise, for 43 years. They spent much of this time living in the east wing of Charlottenburg. In 1804, following Prussia's defeat at Jena-Auerstedt, Napoleon marched into Berlin and settled in the palace, which became his headquarters.  Their eldest son, Friedrich Wilhelm IV, who reigned from 1840 to 1861, lived in the upper storey of the central palace building. After Friedrich Wilhelm IV died, the only other royal resident of the palace was Friedrich III, who reigned for 99 days in 1888.The palace was badly damaged in 1943 during the Second World War. In 1951, the war-damaged Stadtschloss in East Berlin was demolished and, as the damage to Charlottenburg was at least as serious, it was feared that it would also be demolished. However, following the efforts of Margarete K\u00fchn, the director of the State Palaces and Gardens, it was rebuilt to its former condition, with gigantic modern ceiling paintings by Hann Trier. From 2004 till early 2006, Charlottenburg Palace was the seat of the President of Germany, whilst Schloss Bellevue was being renovated.\n\n\n=== Grounds ===\n\nThe garden was designed in 1697 in Baroque style by Simeon Godeau, who had been influenced by Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre, designer of the gardens at Versailles. Godeau's design consisted of geometric patterns, with avenues and moats, which separated the garden from its natural surroundings. Beyond the formal gardens was the Carp Pond. Towards the end of the 18th century, a less formal, more natural-looking garden design became fashionable. In 1787 the Royal Gardener Georg Steiner redesigned the garden in the English landscape style for Friedrich Wilhelm II, the work being directed by Peter Joseph Lenn\u00e9. After the Second World War, the centre of the garden was restored to its previous baroque style.In 1788, Friedrich Wilhelm II arranged for the building of the Belvedere, designed by Carl Gotthard Langhans, in the grounds beyond the Carp Pond. The building was used as a teahouse and as a viewing-tower. Langhans also designed the Palace Theatre, which was built between 1788 and 1791 to the west of the Orangery wing. The Mausoleum was built as a tomb for Queen Luise between 1810 and 1812 in neoclassical style to a design by Heinrich Gentz. After the death of Friedrich Wilhelm III, it was extended; this design being by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. It was extended again in 1890\u201391 by Albert Geyer to accommodate the graves of Wilhelm I and his wife Augusta. In 1825, Friedrich Wilhelm III added the Neuer Pavilion, an Italianate villa designed by Schinkel, to the north of the palace. This was damaged in the war in 1943 and was reconstructed between 1957 and 1970.\n\n\n=== Burials ===\nLouise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz\nFrederick William III of Prussia\nWilhelm I, German Emperor\nPrince Albert of Prussia (1809\u20131872)\nAugusta of Saxe-Weimar\n\n\n== Today ==\n\nThe palace and grounds are a major visitor attraction.\n\nFor an admission charge, parts of the interior of the palace are open to visitors, including the Old Palace (Alte Schloss) and the New Wing (Neuer Fl\u00fcgel). The Old Palace contains many rooms with baroque decoration, and includes a room called the Porcelain Cabinet, which holds thousands of porcelain objects. On special display are the crown jewels and the royal silver and fine porcelain tableware. The New Wing includes the opulent rococo State Apartments of Frederick the Great and the more modest Winter Chambers of Friedrich Wilhelm II. The formal and informal gardens are freely open to the public.\nFor an admission charge, the Mausoleum, the Belvedere and the Neue Pavilion are open to visitors. The Mausoleum contains the graves of, and memorials to, members of the Hohenzollern family. The memorial to Queen Luise includes her reclining effigy, which is made from Carrara marble and was designed by Christian Daniel Rauch.\nAlso open to the public are the Belvedere, which contains a collection of Berlin porcelain, and the Neue Pavilion, which houses a collection of arts and crafts of the period when Schinkel was active.\nThe former Orangery houses a restaurant and caf\u00e9. Destroyed during World War II, the Great Orangery was reconstructed on the model of the baroque building. Today, it shines in its old brilliance again. The light-flooded festival room provides a pleasant framework for cultural events, concerts and banquets.\nIn addition, a large equestrian statue of Friedrich Wilhelm I is the focus of the palace courtyard. This was designed by Andreas Schl\u00fcter and made between 1696 and 1700. From 1703, it stood on the Langen Br\u00fccke (now the Rathausbr\u00fccke) but was moved to a place of safety in the Second World War. On its return after the war, the barge carrying it sank and it was not salvaged until 1949. In 1952, it was erected on its present site. Across the street of the palace are two more museums, the Br\u00f6han Museum, which contains art nouveau and art deco articles, and the Berggruen Museum, which houses modern art, in particular works by Picasso and Klee.On the left is the Scharf-Gerstenberg Collection.

          "My parents and I took the Potsdam City Tour bus after being duped by the convincing tout and asking the information office. We were told that the buses were hop on/off, would come every half an hour, and an audioguide would be provided. BUT the buses were consistently late.",
          "Our guide tried very hard to tour in. It's German and English. Although she did ok I felt like in English we missed much of the explanations. I think it would have been better to do the on off bus instead although you do get both with the tour but going back is timely",
          "The bus tour which will do you all the main sites in Potsdam plus the railway station when you want to leave is excellent. What makes it even better is the money off you get with a Berlin welcome card. If you buy all three zones then you can use public transport to get to",
          "We were swayed by the hop on hop off bus tour as we really wanted to see Sansoucci. We enjoyed the audio tour and hopped off at the end to spend some time at Sansoucci. We spent an hour in total there, which was mostly stopping off at the cafe. The castle seems in urgent need of",

          "We wanted to do something different for a change - we took the U Bahn to Potsdamer Platz, where we decided to go on the Potsdam City Tour = for some sightseeing and where the Potsdam Agreement was signed. There were headphones on the bus for the various different languages -",
          "We got lucky getting on this tour, we arrived by train - just before the tour left otherwise we would probably only have seen central Potsdam. It's a massive area and whilst it could be done by public transport, the get on / off convenience of the bus is good. Whilst our trip",
          "Potsdam, once the residence of Prussian kings is a 35 minute train ride from Berlin. We walk through the Bridge of Spies where in 1962 an American pilot was exchange for a Soviet spy. Alex did a great job in taking us through the history of this city and sights of the quaint",

          "Another interesting tour through Insider Tours. Our guide, Jamie, did an excellent job of showing the sights and giving us the history of Potsdam. This was one of the longest tours I have taken, running around 6 hours time. The pace was very good although we were on our feet",
          "We took this hop on hop off bus to avoid swapping and changes buses to see the city and its surrounds. It cost 12.5 euros with discount- the full price is 17 euros, which I think is too much. We had an open topped bus with a closed roof - it poured down - I was pleased we did",
          "As soon as you arrive at Potsdam station, you have a choice of various bus tours. A good way to get a proper impression of this historic city and its many palaces. We only viewed those from the outside though. A walk through the park around Sans Soucis also gives a good",

          "Barry was our guide and he did an extraordinary job considering the obstacles the day presented- people not returning on time, missed trams and busses, a very large group, train delays. He was very entertaining and quite knowledgeable on the history of the city, from early days",
          "About the only useful aspect of this tour is the transportation itself. Otherwise, the English audio guide available in the bus was atrocious. The recording is very amateurish and confusing, as it's not properly synced up to where the bus actually is. You will often find",
          "While visiting Berlin, we spent a wonderful day at Potsdam - - easy to get to via Berlin's S-Bahn system. The hop-on-hop-off City Tour is well worth taking to get an overview of this beautiful and historic place. We chose to get off to see some of the royal palaces and this",

          "As we alighted the train at Potsdam we were approached by a tour guide who pointed us in the direction of the bus. As it was winter they were only running two tours, morning and afternoon and not the full hop on hop off service. The tour was a sightseeing tour with three guided",
          "It was a nightmare to find a decent restaurant. Most of the restaurants are full with students and cheap. Food is low quality. The city itself is amazingly nice, but not worth more than a day",
          "Despite the gray, drizzly day my husband and I both enjoyed the walking tour of Potsdam. Our guide, Matti, spoke English very well. His commentary was interesting, detailed, and provided \"insider\" knowledge that only a student of history would know--which he did, as he studied",
          "We took the train from Berlin to Potsdam and upon arrival outside the station we were asked if we would like to go on a the tour and we agreed, my father thou was not feeling 100% and we have to compliment the young gentleman who helped us out and was very helpful, we really",
          "We have taken many hop-on-hop-off tours in many cities, but this one is one of the best. The commentary is recorded and takes the route of a discussion between two people. This maintains the interest level and you feel as if you are part of a discussion. Well worthwhile!",
          "We took the train from Berlin to Potsdam, included in the Berlin 5 day Welcome Card. Once you have reached Potsdam it is best to take immediately the Hop on Hop Off Buses from the train station. It gets crowded from other points. It costs about Euros 50 for 2 adults and 2",
          "We were lured into joining this city tour of potsdam being promised all sorts of things....don't do it, it's a waste of money and to top it all off our audio wasn't working. We tried for several minutes until finally a girl came and couldn't fix it. So we had to go doenstairs",
          "It was a good sunny weather when we visited the very historic and old city near Berlin Germany. Potsdam city is more than one thousand years old and is famous for its beautiful architecture. The entire city is very clean and beautiful. Tour guide could explain the history of the",
          "We took the tour from the train station and stayed on until it finished full circle getting off at a little market street which was lovely. We saw the Kaiser summer residences, the KGB offices, the bridge where they swapped spies and it was very interesting. It was well worth",
          "We began our adventure at Zoologischer Garten station where we were met by the very friendly and approachable Caroline (from Germany - excellent English speaker and a great sense of humour). She made sure we all made it on and off the correct train and bus which was impressive",
          "We took the 2-hour tour around Potsdam. The city and the palaces as well as the old town are worth a visit, but this tour was a disappointment. The guide bellowed only in German despite the promise in the brochure as well as at the ticket counter that it would be live commentary",
          "We took the train from Berlin to Potsdam (only half an hour from Alexanderplatz). Potsdam is a beautiful town. It is naturally beautiful with lakes and nature. We decided to take the hop on and off Potsdam City Tour bus from the train station. The service is informative and",
          "This was a bus tour for us but one that should us we would need to return to Berlin to cover more of this area, it was 1.3/4 of an hour but covered much in that time, so much that we will need to go back and visit all the areas on the tour.",
          "We only went to Potsdam to get to Schloss Sans Souci but eneded up doing the Bus Tour of the city! Well worth it! Didn't realise the size and scale of Potsdam nor the historical significance of the place. It has so much to see. We would recommend you do the full tour (approx",
          "Great way to see Potsdam in a short time as we went by train from Berlin for the day. Guide was really good,very informative,two or three stops, you could explore on your own or follow the guide. Gardens are beautiful,palaces massive, Potsdam is charming and well worth a visit.",
          "We decided to join the tour since our time in Potsdam was limited. Seemed like a sweet deal, but the live guide spoke so loudly we couldn't possibly hear the english prerecording. We decided to drop out of the tour, since the bus smelled quite badly of gazoline.",
          "Whilst in Berlin we decided to visit Potsdam for a day sightseeing. We boarded a train to Potsdam and on arrival at the main station we booked a 2 hour 30 minutes sightseeing tour which included three guided walks at the palaces. There is only one tour that operates in December",
          "We went to Potsdam on a Monday when all the places of interest were closed so decided to take the hop on/ hop off bus. The first bus to the Potsdam conference house was good. We used the headphones and listened to the audio guide. Once we got off we had 30 minutes until the next",
          "We did this tour as we had very little time and Potsdam has so much to see. We decided to do the tour and get off at Sanssouci. The guide, Henrik, was excellent giving a good account of all we were seeing in both English and German. No need for headsets. I, rather stupidly,",
          "The hop on hop off experience to our observation was not used as a on and off experience. Most of the riders did not leave the bus but rode it for most or all the complete loop. The tour leader spoke only in German but listening devices were available for English among other",
          "Potsdam is a quaint city that was very powerful post world war 2. There are many fascinating castles to visit. You can see the entire city in one day.",
          "Another passionate tour with Tarek, knowledgeable, articulate and witty. He was an entertainer, informative and patient with his entourage. He made the whole experience fun and educational... he also answered any and all questions faster then Google. He also looked after",
          "We chose this tour as it was meant to have live English commentary and was hop on hop off every 30 minutes. The German tourists were permitted onto the open topped bus before the other tourists so we ended up very hot and annoyed downstairs. The live commentary was a pre",
          "I agree with previous reviews - Maria is gorgeous and a gem. Her background training in drama proved invaluable. [she did have small parts in films too including Nottinghill!] Maria brought alive the history that she obviously knows so well. Great sense of humour also. This",
          "We did the hop on hop off Potsdam City tour and chose this company because the brochures and the people selling the tickets stated that live English tour guides were available on all buses. We did not have a single person talk to us in English and when we asked the guide to",
          "A good way to get an overview of Potsdam. But it does not, as advertised, have live commentary in English as well as German. The guides refuse to do it in both languages so you have to rely on pre-used headphones left at the seat - pretty unhygienic. Also the recorded commentary",
          "An excellent part walking tour under the leadership of a very knowledgeable and pleasant guide Barry McKeon from Ireland. He took us to a variety of places surrounding and including the lovely main town centre. Barry gave us a lot of historical information during a nice",
          "The overview you get during the Hop on-hop off Potsdam city tour (1,5h) is very good. Everything is explained by a live tour guide if you speak German (other languages with headphones). Depending on the guide you might look very quickly left and right and vice versa or there is",
          "Potsdam is a great place full of interesting palaces and gardens. Barry, our guide, filled in some of its history and showed us a variety of sights. We saw the bridge where spies were exchanged between East and West Berlin, the palace where Stalin, Churchill and Truman conferred",
          "We decided to visit Potsdam for the day on the S-bann out of Berlin, an easy journey of about 30 minutes. As we knew we couldn't see everything we decided to get a hop-on hop-off rather than an ordinary bus to Sanssouci as that way we could get the guided commentary & see some",
          "Terrific tour of Potsdam led by Maria. Was a challenging day in the drizzle but Maria's narrative throughout the day was superb and complemented the magnificent scenery. Highly recommended.",
          "Visitors to the historic town of Potsdam near Berlin will find the tour buses of several companies parked outside the railway station, with touts eager to attract their custom. We opted for the 1-hour-45-minute hop-on hop-off Potsdam City Tour rather than longer alternatives.",
          "In addition to being tall and stunning, our tour guide Maria was fabulous. She's smart, funny, and knows what seems to be a limitless number of great stories about the history and architecture of this marvelous city, not to mention the antics & potatoes at Sans Souci. She's an",
          "We had visited Potsdam for the day whilst staying in Berlin and the city tour was perfect for the short time we had there. Potsdam is a beautiful city with lots of interest so well worth a visit.",

          "We took this bus tour during a day trip from Berlin and with the discount offered on production of our Berlin Welcome Cards, found this to be good value at 11 Euros each for a 90 minute tour. The route was extensive and took in all parts of the city before heading off into the",

          "We spent a very pleasant day exploring Potsdam with our guide, David. Our group met in Berlin and traveled to Potsdam on public transportation (30 minutes). David walked with us all through the city for several hours. We stopped for lunch in the downtown area before heading",
          "When arriving by train (for a day trip from Berlin) in Potsdam, we did not have a concrete plan for that day. But right across from the train station were a number of tour busses parked, waiting for customers. We just picked the one that was to leave the soonest. We were glad we",
          "I first took this tour in Winter 2010. Everything was covered in snow but the tour went ahead and ran on time. Buying the tickets back then was a little bit aggressive as sales reps jumped on us the moment we left the train platform. The tourguide speaks English as well as",
          "we decided to do the hop-on-off City Tour to give us good overview of the place. We took the Potsdam City Tour bus from the station. The guide spoke in German but we had audioguides that plugged into the seats and had a choice of five languages. Wearing the headphones and",

          "When visiting Berlin one should take a day and travel to Potsdam. From Alexanderplatz the S7 train takes about 40-50 minutes. Potsdam is a small quiet city that has a magnificent mall, tons of shops and restaurants. take a tour to see Sans Souci and the mansion where the Potsdam",
          "My wife and I took the S-bahn out to Potsdam not really sure how to get around. Once we got there we chose the City Tour that stopped at all the main palaces. It also had a guide JAN who took us around. There were 3 of us that did not speak German so he would tour the group",
          "we caught the train from Berlin to Potsdam (6 euro return) outside of the station were the tour buses we booked a hop on hop off trip (9 euro) we are glad we did because there is no way you could see all of the beautiful sights of this city by walking, we did the full tour",
          "Visited Potsdam from Berlin, 45 mins on train. Potsdam is lovely, palaces, gardens, square and other historical sights. wasn't expecting to see a windmill. I enjoyed the tour, our guide was great.It is a hop on hop off, we hopped off at cecilhof to visit the brewery/beer",
          "There is nothing bad I can say about Potsdam.There is so much too see in this small City.A must is the City tour bus where you are taken to all the main tourist sites on a hop on hop off basis and follow that with a river cruise where you see the City from the water and you",
          "This was a fabulous excursion. We stayed in Berlin and took the S Bahn to Potsdam it was about a 45 min. train ride (all included in your ABC visitors card). We then took the coach trip around the city. Which took between 2.5 and 3 hours . We had ear phone commentary . this was",

          "On Saturday 13th of August, my family and I booked the Postdam Bus City Tour, because this tour had commentary via deadphones in Spanish and other languages. When we got on the bus, as the upper floor was full, we sat in the lower floor, where NO HEADPHONE PLUG IN IS AVAILABLE.",
          "Potsdam is another group of palaces, nothing special or original... You had to pay for every sight. Around on the carriage though was worth the waiting and the smell",
          "Quite a place! I would but your tickets in advance online if you can, saves time I recommend the ticket that includes all palaces otherwise they will nickel and dime you to death for each palace separately. Parking costs too the whole ticket was 10 or 12 Euros but we walked"

        "wiki": "Nauener Tor (Nauen Gate) is one of the three preserved gates of Potsdam, Germany. It was built in 1755 and is the first example of the influence of English Gothic Revival architecture in Continental Europe.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first Nauener Tor was built around 1720 about 400 metres away from the current site. The second gate was built in 1733 at the current site. In 1755 the gate was rebuilt in its current form by the architect Johann Gottfried B\u00fcring based on a sketch by Frederick II. Originally there was a city wall connecting the Nauen gate with the other two gates, the J\u00e4gertor and the \"small\" Brandenburg Gate.\nToday the three Potsdam gates are connected by a promenade, instead of a city wall. Nauener Tor is located in close proximity to the Dutch Quarter. Its users were the military and merchants, craftsmen and administrations. Today the square in front of the Nauener Tor has a high density of cafes, restaurants and bars is a popular meeting point of people in Potsdam and their guests. Tram tracks lead directly through Nauener Tor.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nPaul Sigel, Silke D\u00e4hmlow, Frank Seehausen, Lucas Elmenhorst: Architekturf\u00fchrer Potsdam - Dietrich Reimer Verlag, Berlin 2006, ISBN 3-496-01325-7\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Nauener Tor at Wikimedia Commons",

          "It\u2019s hard to miss it if walking the centre of Potsdam. Smaller and more ornate gate than that of Berlin. Potsdam people prefer their own Brandenburg Gate.",
          "Small, charming \"gate\" is anchor end for Brandenburger Strasse (running eastward to Katholische Pfarrkirche St. Peter und Paul) where restaurants, shops, and Christmas Market dominate Potsdam's city center.",
          "Luisenplatz was my favourite spot in Potsdam. Guarded by the Brandenburg Gate, the little sister of Berlin's version, bathes in sun throughout the day, peaceful and surrounded by restaurants and terraces.",
          "This is the symbol in all the media , when Berlin is in the news.The Brandenburg Gate is the center of all kind of demonstrations and events.From Music to sport-events, from political demos to just photo events. A must see and picture event close to the Holocaust monument!",
          "Berlin,an exciting city and the Brandenburg Gate at the centre. A magnificent sight that unites Berlin. We saw it in the sunlight and at sunset.A trip to Berlin needs a visit to the Brandenburg Gate.",
          "The gate was HUGE and IMPRESSIVE at the BEGINNING of the MAIN street of Berlin. Street name was Unter den Linden Must see and take selfie in front of gate. Then shop all the shops on that street and walk all the way along that street to Berlin Cathedral and on to",
          "The gate in Potsdam was erected around 55 years before, the Berlin's one.A nice example of barroque style.",
          "This is a smaller version of the more famous one in Central Berlin. Interesting to see and walk through.",
          "You can't visit Berlin without seeing this historic landmark. We took a three hour walking tour( free - but tips given at the end) that took in historic Germany. Very impressive structure.",
          "This gate leads to a long pedestrian shopping street full of local shops, with a church located at the other end. It\u2019s sight in its own right and a good place for a photo or two,",
          "Although I can\u2019t say that they cause special admiration, but only because I already managed to see a lot of beautiful and interesting in the country, so by themselves these gates are well made cute and interesting.",
          "Well worth a visit as is also the centre of the city and its splendid St. Nicholas Church.the brandenburg Gate is even older than the one in Berlin and the walks along the river gives a wonderful feel to the place",
          "The original, smaller than the Berlin version and super clean now. One main arch and 2 smaller side arches. Leads on to a lovely pedestrian street where even cyclists have to push their bikes!!",
          "This is the original Brandenburg Tor (Gate), which was very recently cleaned up. It's the entrance to the main shopping street in Potsdam, Brandenburger Stra\u00dfe. Again, this is a peace of history, and while the Brandenburg Tor in Berlin is bigger, this is still the original",
          "Not THE Brandenburg gate but still very big and impressive. Nice park and shops and restaurants close by.",
          "The sculptures in the arch way is breathtaking. Worth your time to walk up to view each arch. A wonder that is was not destroyed during the world war II.",
          "Don't get your expectations too high, this is a pale comparison to the Gate in Berlin. The prettier side does not show from the open urban area, but from across the passing street on which you are cramped up close to the Gate. There are no \"good photo\" opp as pretty side is",
          "This is the smaller version of the iconic gate in Berlin. It looks rather new and has less character as compared to the one in Berlin. The surrounding is very pleasant and lots of opportunities to take nice photos.",
          "Its like a another version of the real thing in berlin. And since most things in potsdam are in walking distance of each other its worh seeing. Dont miss seeing the real one in berlin though.",
          "This Brandenburg Gate is at one end of the Brandenburger Strasse and at the other end is the St. Peter and Paul Church. Brandenburg Tor (Gate) is unassuming/small in comparison to its namesake in Berlin. However, this Potsdam Gate is actually 20 years older. The Brandenburg",

          "The area around the Brandenburger gate is really cosy. It\u2019s nice to walk around in this little city with all the nice cafes A trip worthy",
          "i have always recognized the Brandenburg gate with Berlin opened in 1791 and did not realize that Potsdam had its own gate.. Impressive near the shopping area completed in 1770 as a neo classical arch.making it older than its Berlin Cousin .",
          "This is still hands-down one of the most popular attractions in Berlin. The long history of this site, combined with the memorable events that occurred around it, makes it one of the places you have to say you visited. Currently under restoration, you can nevertheless get a good",
          "In September 2018, I walked past the Brandenburger Gate in Potsdam and took a photo. If you are making a daytrip to Potsdam, then your priority should be Sanssouci Park with its palaces and Cecilienhof with its World War 2 history. But afterwards, it is definitely worth",

          "I was looking forward to seeing the detail on the Brandenburger Gate, located opposite the Luisenplatz, not that far from Sanssouci Park. It is one of 3 city gates still standing. Unlike Jager Tor and Nauener Tor with their grey brick towers attached to the city's mid 18th",

          "Nothing to say much about it as a review cause its just a monument that people should visit in berlin, but what i really liked is that everybody is chill and u are allowed to shoot videos and pictures as u like nobody will be annoying even its so busy there all the time, cheers",
          ".. But there is a nearby night market when I visited that was a bigger highlight. The adjacent Brandenburg-Strausse is a little touristic but worth a look. When I visited December 2017, it was rather comically under construction/maintenance. Haha!",

          "The Brandenburger Gate, is a very imposing sight when you first see it - there is on the top of the gate, a chariot with four horses and a charioteer.. We went on the City Tour bus, which stopped at the gate for about twenty minutes - if you are in Berlin - this a must to",
          "Quite interesting to walk up to and see but a political rally was on at the same time so was crowded and full of graphic pictures. A beautiful place though and very thought provoking",
          "It goes without saying that, when you visit Berlin, you MUST visit the Brandenburger Tor. It's one of the most iconic landmarks in the city and, for historians, an apt symbol for the Cold War itself. That said, it's a pretty quick stop after the Reichstag, a walk in Tiergarten",
          "The gate is fine - I valued it more as a hub for all the going ons in the city. It's the beginning of Brandenburger Stra\u00dfe, and there seemed to always be some live music or something happening right out in the plaza in front.",

          "Less well-known than the iconic Berlin gate, this beautiful gate is well worth seeing. It looks gorgeous in the sun. There is plenty of space to enjoy it on the way to the Sansouci Palace.",
          "Instead of a city wall, the entire length of the wall is now a beautiful promenade that is a joy to cycle through. I really love both Berlin\u2019s and Potsdam\u2019s ample cycling paths. It really beats walking. The promonade connects the Nauener Tor to Potsdam very own Brandenburg Gate.",
          "Frederick the Great, decided to make a second one in 1773 not far from his Palace. Obviously based on Roman models, though smaller than the Berlin Brandenburger Tor is nonethe less impressive",
          "Much more impressive than the one in Berlin. Lots of restaurnat on the way to it, shops, coffee houses and artists. Very nice place and not to be missed when in Potsdam. Recommended!",
          "If you are in Berlin, you can't not visit the Brandenburg gate. It stands at the bottom of \"Unter den Linden\" just in front of the Tiergarten. We passed by it many times on our wanders around Berlin, and it was always very busy with tourists as you would expect. One thing we",

          "What do I say...How many bloody beautiful gates can you go through. Well you can go through a loot in Potsdam and they are all beautiful. May I say that this is one of the best towns we have been in in Germany.",
          "If you go to see Potsdam Garden you should also make a walk through the city. We enjoyed this city and this Gate was nice to see too. Stop for coffee etc. We stayed in Berlin, but it was good to visit here too.",
          "If you pass by and make some photos, it is good enough. Nothing special, but if you are anyhow in the area, just stop.",
          "We had a walk through the town which once upon a time was the main town. You can still observe some buildings which have not been refurbished and have the old rustic look reminiscent of the war period. The area also contains houses which are modeled as per other cultures like",
          "It is a nice place but beside going under the gate there is not much to do or see. There is a nice view of the church through the gate, and if you are looking for shops it is the place (C&A, Zara and so on).",
          "The Brandenburger Gate is quite impressive and the beginning of a charming part of Potsdam marked off for pedestrian traffic. Shops and restaurants are abundant.",

          "This is right in the middle of town. We just happened upon it. It is hard to miss. Good pictures around it. Potsdam is a good town to stop in if you are near. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit though. Nothing to do here.",
          "The best of the three town gates but nothing very special. Lots of traffic but worth walking past on the way to somewhere else.",
          "This gate was built as a victory symbol for Frederick the Great to commemorate his sucess in the 7 year's war. It used to be part of a city wall and people went through this gate into the town of Brandenburg. The interesting thing about this triumphal arch is its two sides",
          "Nice place to hang out in good weather, with the square surrounded by restaurants with outdoor seating",
          "It's nice to see, check off the list. The walk through the neighborhood around it is much more interesting. Surrounded by nice restaurants and cafes, it stands between the Hbf and other major touristic objectives, so it's hard to miss.",
          "We had an amazing view of the Gate from our hotel, see my other reviews. Loved this historical beauty.",
          "The Brandenburg gate in Potsdam was not a good as the one in Berlin. It is located in a neat old square at the heart of old Potsdam so its well worth swinging by!",
          "Nice and no more. In his back there is a pedestrian mall where are some good restaurants. Walking distance from the Sanssouci Park.",
          "The gate is symbolic of the old city of Potsdam--make sure to eat while you are there. IT is amazing that something so close to Berlin survived without damage!",

          "If you are visiting Potsdam, you should visit Brandenburger Gate. It is one of the stops if you are taking the hop on/off sightseeing bus. The gate itself is smaller compared to the one in Berlin but I like the surroundings. Behind the gate you can find a lot of restaurants and",
          "A small version of the real Tor, nothing special but can be done if walking in the area. Lots of cafe and shopping near by",
          "This is one of those things that is worth a visit as it's an important piece of history but it's not somewhere where you will stay long and there's not much to see. I'd recommend doing it as part of a bus tour where you either see it from the bus or hop off and have a quick",
          "We enjoyed our visit to Potsdam and will be visiting again in the future. There is a lot to see and it takes more that a single visit.",
          "The original! Loved the entire area. Lots of small shops in the area. Bit of a tourist trap, but worth it. Try the little ice cream shop nearby!",
          "Been there after a long day at the sans Sousi park. We had nice view from the coffee shop opposite of the gate. Not something special but you cannot miss it when being at the area",
          "Our Segway tour rounded this corner then wow there it was - towering above us in all its grandure and hidden tales of historical significance and now serving for us as a monument for orientation.",
          "it is at he beginning of the main pedestrian and shopping street in Potsdam, there is a nice fountain and few restaurants so you can sit and watch the life around",
          "The gate is an excellent visit. It is to be seen at night when lights brighten it given its well chosen color as well. It is kind of a reminder of the Triumph Arch of Paris on a smaller scale.",

        "wiki": "Potsdam (German pronunciation: [\u02c8p\u0254t\u0361sdam] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of the German federal state of Brandenburg. It directly borders the German capital, Berlin, and is part of the Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region. It is situated on the River Havel some 25 kilometres (16 miles) southwest of Berlin's city centre.\nPotsdam was a residence of the Prussian kings and the German Kaiser until 1918. Its planning embodied ideas of the Age of Enlightenment: through a careful balance of architecture and landscape, Potsdam was intended as \"a picturesque, pastoral dream\" which would remind its residents of their relationship with nature and reason.The city lies in an area of interconnected lakes and is distinguished by a series of cultural landmarks, in particular the parks and palaces of Sanssouci, the largest World Heritage Site in Germany. The Potsdam Conference in 1945 was held at Cecilienhof Palace.\nBabelsberg, in the south-eastern part of Potsdam, was already by the 1930s the home of a major film production studio and it has enjoyed success as an important center of European film production since the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Filmstudio Babelsberg is the oldest large-scale film studio in the world.Potsdam developed into a centre of science in Germany in the 19th century. Today, there are three public colleges, the University of Potsdam, and more than 30 research institutes in the city.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe area was formed from a series of large moraines left after the last glacial period. Today, only one quarter of the city is built up, the rest remaining as green space.\nThere are about 20 lakes and rivers in and around Potsdam, such as the Havel, the Griebnitzsee, Templiner See, Tiefer See, Jungfernsee, Teltowkanal, Heiliger See, and Sacrower See. The highest point is the 114-metre (374 ft) high Kleiner Ravensberg.\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\nPotsdam is divided into seven historic city Bezirke and nine new Stadtteile (villages), which joined the city in 2003. The appearance of the city quarters is quite different. Those in the north and in the centre consist mainly of historical buildings, the south of the city is dominated by larger areas of newer buildings.\nThe city of Potsdam is divided into 34 Stadtteile (or quarters), which are divided further into 84 statistical Bezirke.\nToday one distinguishes between the older parts of the city (areas of the historic city and places suburbanized at the latest in 1939) - these are the city center, the western and northern suburbs, Bornim, Bornstedt, Nedlitz, Potsdam South, Babelsberg, Drewitz, Stern and Kirchsteigfeld - and those communities incorporated after 1990 which have since 2003 become Stadtteile - these are Eiche, Fahrland, Golm, Gro\u00df Glienicke, Grube, Marquardt, Neu Fahrland, Satzkorn and Uetz-Paaren. The new Stadtteile are located mainly in the north of the city. For the history of all incorporations, see the relevant section on incorporation and spin-offs.\nStructure with statistical numbering:\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nOfficially the climate is oceanic - more degraded by being far from the coast and to the east (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), but using the 1961-1990 normal and the 0 \u00b0C isotherm the city has a humid continental climate (Dfb), which also shows a slight influence of the continent different from the climates predominantly influenced by the Atlantic Ocean. Low averages below freezing for almost all winter causing snows that are frequent and winters are cold, but not as stringent as inland locations or with greater influence from the same. Summer is also relatively warm with temperatures between 23 and 24 \u00b0C, the heat waves being influenced by the UHI of Potsdam.The average winter high temperature is 3.5 \u00b0C (38.3 \u00b0F), with a low of \u22121.7 \u00b0C (28.9 \u00b0F). Snow is common in the winter. Spring and autumn are short. Summers are mild, with a high of 23.6 \u00b0C (74.5 \u00b0F) and a low of 12.7 \u00b0C (54.9 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Potsdam\" originally seems to have been Poztupimi. A common theory is that it derives from an old West Slavonic term meaning \"beneath the oaks\", i.e., the corrupted pod dubmi/dubimi (pod \"beneath\", dub \"oak\"). However some question this explanation.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre- and early history ===\n\nThe area around Potsdam shows signs of occupancy since the Bronze Age and was part of Magna Germania as described by Tacitus. After the great migrations of the Germanic peoples, Slavs moved in and Potsdam was probably founded after the 7th century as a settlement of the Hevelli tribe centred on a castle. It was first mentioned in a document in 993 as Poztupimi, when Emperor Otto III gifted the territory to the Quedlinburg Abbey, then led by his aunt Matilda. By 1317, it was mentioned as a small town. It gained its town charter in 1345. In 1573, it was still a small market town of 2,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n=== Early modern era ===\nPotsdam lost nearly half of its population due to the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648).\nA continuous Hohenzollern possession since 1415, Potsdam became prominent, when it was chosen in 1660 as the hunting residence of Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg, the core of the powerful state that later became the Kingdom of Prussia. It also housed Prussian barracks.\n\nAfter the Edict of Potsdam in 1685, Potsdam became a centre of European immigration. Its religious freedom attracted people from France (Huguenots), Russia, the Netherlands and Bohemia. The edict accelerated population growth and economic recovery.\nLater, the city became a full residence of the Prussian royal family. The buildings of the royal residences were built mainly during the reign of Frederick the Great. One of these is the Sanssouci Palace (French: \"without cares\", by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff, 1744), famed for its formal gardens and Rococo interiors. Other royal residences include the New Palace and the Orangery.\nIn 1815, at the formation of the Province of Brandenburg, Potsdam became the provincial capital until 1918, except for a period between 1827 and 1843 when Berlin was the provincial capital (as it became once again after 1918). The province comprised two governorates named after their capitals Potsdam and Frankfurt (Oder).\n\n\n=== Governorate of Potsdam ===\n\nBetween 1815 and 1945, the city of Potsdam served as capital of the governorate of Potsdam (German: Regierungsbezirk Potsdam). The Regierungsbezirk encompassed the former districts of Uckermark, the Mark of Priegnitz, and the greater part of the Middle March. It was situated between Mecklenburg and the Province of Pomerania on the north, and the Province of Saxony on the south and west (Berlin, with a small surrounding district, was an urban governorate and enclave within the governorate of Potsdam between 1815 and 1822, then it merged as urban district into the governorate only to be disentangled again from Potsdam governorate in 1875, becoming a distinct province-like entity on 1 April 1881). Towards the north west the governorate was bounded by the rivers Elbe and the Havel, and on the north east by the Oder. The south eastern boundary was to the neighbouring governorate of Frankfurt (Oder). About 500,000 inhabitants lived in the Potsdam governorate, which covered an area of about 20,700 square kilometres (7,992 sq mi), divided into thirteen rural districts, partially named after their capitals:\nThe traditional towns in the governorate were small, however, in the course of the industrial labour migration some reached the rank of urban districts. The principal towns were Brandenburg upon Havel, K\u00f6penick, Potsdam, Prenzlau, Spandau and Ruppin. Until 1875 Berlin also was a town within the governorate. After its disentanglement a number of its suburbs outside Berlin's municipal borders grew to towns, many forming urban Bezirke within the governorate of Potsdam such as Charlottenburg, Lichtenberg, Rixdorf (after 1912 Neuk\u00f6lln), and Sch\u00f6neberg (all of which, as well as K\u00f6penick and Spandau, incorporated into Greater Berlin in 1920). The urban Bezirke were (years indicating the elevation to rank of urban Bezirkor affiliation with Potsdam governorate, respectively):\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nBerlin was the capital of Prussia and later of the German Empire, but the court remained in Potsdam, where many government officials settled. In 1914, Emperor Wilhelm II signed the Declaration of War in the Neues Palais (New Palace). The city lost its status as a \"second capital\" in 1918, when Wilhelm II abdicated and Germany became a Republic at the end of World War I.\nAt the start of the Third Reich in 1933 there was a ceremonial handshake between President Paul von Hindenburg and the new Chancellor Adolf Hitler on 21 March 1933 in Potsdam's Garrison Church in what became known as the \"Day of Potsdam\". This symbolised a coalition of the military (Reichswehr) and Nazism. Potsdam was severely damaged by Allied bombing raids during World War II.\n\nThe Cecilienhof Palace was the scene of the Potsdam Conference from 17 July to 2 August 1945, at which the victorious Allied leaders (Harry S. Truman; Winston Churchill and his successor, Clement Attlee; and Joseph Stalin) met to decide the future of Germany and postwar Europe in general. The conference ended with the Potsdam Agreement and the Potsdam Declaration.\n\nThe government of East Germany (formally known as the German Democratic Republic (German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik, DDR)) tried to remove symbols of \"Prussian militarism\". Many historic buildings, some of them badly damaged in the war, were demolished.\nWhen in 1946 the remainder of the Province of Brandenburg west of the Oder-Nei\u00dfe line was constituted as the state of Brandenburg, Potsdam became its capital. In 1952 the GDR disestablished its federal states and replaced them by smaller new East German administrative districts known as Bezirke. Potsdam became the capital of the new Bezirk Potsdam until 1990.\nPotsdam, south-west of Berlin, lay just outside West Berlin after the construction of the Berlin Wall. The walling off of West Berlin not only isolated Potsdam from West Berlin, but also doubled commuting times to East Berlin. The Glienicke Bridge across the Havel connected the city to West Berlin and was the scene of some Cold War exchanges of spies.\nAfter German reunification, Potsdam became the capital of the newly re-established state of Brandenburg. Since then there have been many ideas and efforts to reconstruct the original appearance of the city, including the Potsdam City Palace and the Garrison Church.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nSince 2000 Potsdam has been one of the fastest growing cities in Germany.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== International residents ===\n\nLargest groups of foreign residents:\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\n\n=== City government ===\nPotsdam has had a mayor (B\u00fcrgermeister) and city council since the 15th century. From 1809 the city council was elected, with a mayor (Oberb\u00fcrgermeister) at its head. During the Third Reich the mayor was selected by the NSDAP and the city council was dissolved; it was reconstituted in token form after 1945, but free elections did not take place until after reunification.\nToday, the city council is the city's central administrative authority. Local elections took place on 26 October 2003 and again in 2008. Between 1990 and 1999, the Chairman of the City Council was known as the \"Town President\" but today the post is the \"Chairman of the City Council\". The mayor is elected directly by the population.\n\n\n=== Brandenburg state government ===\nThe Landtag Brandenburg, the parliament of the federal state of Brandenburg is in Potsdam. It has been housed in the Potsdam City Palace since 2014.\n\n\n== Twin towns - sister cities ==\n\nPotsdam is twinned with:\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\n\n==== Rail transport ====\nPotsdam, included in the fare zone \"C\" (Tarifbereich C) of Berlin's public transport area and fare zones A and B of its own public transport area, is served by the S7 S-Bahn line. The stations served are Griebnitzsee, Babelsberg and the Central Station (Hauptbahnhof), the main and long-distance station of the city. Other DB stations in Potsdam are Charlottenhof, Park Sanssouci (including the monumental Kaiserbahnhof), Medienstadt Babelsberg, Rehbr\u00fccke, Pirschheide and Marquardt. The city also possesses a 27 km-long tramway network.\n\n\n==== Road transport ====\nPotsdam is served by several motorways: the A 10, a beltway better known as Berliner Ring, the A 115 (using part of the AVUS) and is closely linked to the A 2 and A 9. The B 1 and B 2 federal roads cross the city. Potsdam features a network of urban and suburban buses.\n\n\n== Education and research ==\n\nPotsdam is a university town. The University of Potsdam was founded in 1991 as a university of the State of Brandenburg. Its predecessor was the Akademie f\u00fcr Staats- und Rechtswissenschaften der DDR \"Walter Ulbricht\", a college of education founded in 1948 which was one of the GDR's most important colleges. There are about 20,000 students enrolled at the university.\n\nIn 1991 the Fachhochschule Potsdam was founded as the second college. It had 3,518 students as of 2017.Konrad Wolf Film University of Babelsberg (HFF), founded in 1954 in Babelsberg, is the foremost centre of the German film industry since its birth, with over 600 students.\nThere are also several research foundations, including Fraunhofer Institutes for Applied Polymer Research and Biomedical Engineering, Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute), Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces, and Max Planck Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology, the GFZ - German Research Centre for Geosciences, the Potsdam Astrophysical Institute, the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies, The Leibniz Institute for Agricultural Engineering and Bioeconomy and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, which employs 340 people in researching climate change.As well as universities, Potsdam is home to reputable secondary schools. Montessori Gesamtschule Potsdam, in western Potsdam, attracts 400 students from the Brandenburg and Berlin region.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nPotsdam was historically a centre of European immigration. Its religious tolerance attracted people from France, Russia, the Netherlands and Bohemia. This is still visible in the culture and architecture of the city.\nThe most popular attraction in Potsdam is Sanssouci Park, 2 km (1 mi) west of the city centre. In 1744 King Frederick the Great ordered the construction of a residence here, where he could live sans souci (\"without worries\", in the French spoken at the court). The park hosts a botanical garden (Botanical Garden, Potsdam) and many buildings:\n\nThe Sanssouci Palace (Schloss Sanssouci), a relatively modest palace of the Prussian royal (and later German imperial) family\nThe Orangery Palace (Orangerieschloss), former palace for foreign royal guests\nThe New Palace (Neues Palais), built between 1763 and 1769 to celebrate the end of the Seven Years' War, in which Prussia held off the combined attacks of Austria and Russia. It is a much larger and grander palace than Sanssouci, having over 200 rooms and 400 statues as decoration. It served as a guest house for numerous royal visitors. Today, it houses parts of University of Potsdam.\nThe Charlottenhof Palace (Schloss Charlottenhof), a Neoclassical palace by Karl Friedrich Schinkel built in 1826\nThe Roman Baths (R\u00f6mische B\u00e4der), built by Karl Friedrich Schinkel and Friedrich Ludwig Persius in 1829\u20131840. It is a complex of buildings including a tea pavilion, a Renaissance-style villa, and a Roman bathhouse (from which the whole complex takes its name).\nThe Chinese Tea House (Chinesisches Teehaus), an 18th-century pavilion built in a Chinese style, the fashion of the time.Three gates from the original city wall remain today. The oldest is the Hunters' Gate (J\u00e4gertor), built in 1733. The Nauener Tor was built in 1755 and close to the historic Dutch Quarter. The ornate Brandenburg Gate (built in 1770, not to be confused with the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin) is situated on the Luisenplatz at the western entrance to the old town.\n\nThe Old Market Square (Alter Markt) is Potsdam's historical city centre. For three centuries this was the site of the City Palace (Stadtschlo\u00df), a royal palace built in 1662. Under Frederick the Great, the palace became the winter residence of the Prussian kings. The palace was severely damaged by Allied bombing in 1945 and demolished in 1961 by the Communist authorities. In 2002 the Fortuna Gate (Fortunaportal) was rebuilt in its original historic position which was followed by a complete reconstruction of the palace as the Brandenburg Landtag building inaugurated in 2014. Nearby the square in the Humboldtstra\u00dfe block, which also was demolished after getting damaged in 1945, reconstructions of several representative residential palaces including Palazzo Pompei and Palazzo Barberini housing an arts museum were completed in 2016-2017 alongside buildings with modernized facades to restore the historical proportions of the block.\n\nThe Old Market Square is dominated today by the dome of St. Nicholas' Church (Nikolaikirche), built in 1837 in the Neoclassical style. It was the last work of Karl Friedrich Schinkel, who designed the building but did not live to see its completion. It was finished by his disciples Friedrich August St\u00fcler and Ludwig Persius. The eastern side of the Market Square is dominated by the Old City Hall (Altes Rathaus), built in 1755 by the Dutch architect Jan Bouman (1706\u20131776). It has a characteristic circular tower, crowned with a gilded Atlas bearing the world on his shoulders.\n\nNorth of the Old Market Square is the oval French Church (Franz\u00f6sische Kirche), erected in the 1750s by Boumann for the Huguenot community. To the south lies the Museum Barberini, a copy of the previous building, the Barberini Palace. The museum was funded by the German billionaire Hasso Plattner. The former Baroque building was built by Carl von Gontard in 1771\u20131772, inspired by the Renaissance palace Palazzo Barberini in Rome. The newly built museum was scheduled to open in spring 2017.\nAnother landmark of Potsdam is the two-street Dutch Quarter (Holl\u00e4ndisches Viertel), an ensemble of buildings that is unique in Europe, with about 150 houses built of red bricks in the Dutch style. It was built between 1734 and 1742 under the direction of Jan Bouman to be used by Dutch artisans and craftsmen who had been invited to settle here by King Frederick Wilhelm I. Today, this area is one of Potsdam's most visited quarters.\nNorth of the city centre is the Russian colony of Alexandrowka, a small enclave of Russian architecture (including an Orthodox chapel) built in 1825 for a group of Russian immigrants. Since 1999, the colony has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin.\nEast of the Alexandrowka colony is a large park, the New Garden (Neuer Garten), which was laid out from 1786 in the English style. The site contains two palaces; one of them, the Cecilienhof, was where the Potsdam Conference was held in July and August 1945. The Marmorpalais (Marble Palace) was built in 1789 in Neoclassical style. Nearby is the Biosph\u00e4re Potsdam, a tropical botanical garden.\nBabelsberg, a quarter south-east of the centre, houses the UFA film studios (Babelsberg Studios), and an extensive park with some historical buildings, including the Babelsberg Palace (Schlo\u00df Babelsberg, a Gothic revival palace designed by Schinkel).\nThe Einstein Tower is located within the Albert Einstein Science Park, which is on the top of the Telegraphenberg within an astronomy compound.\nPotsdam also features a memorial centre in the former KGB prison in Leistikowstra\u00dfe. In the Volkspark to the north, there is one of the last monuments dedicated to Lenin in Germany.\nPotsdam joined UNESCO's Network of Creative Cities as a Design City on October 31, 2019 on the occasion of World Cities\u2019 Day.\n\n\n== Parks ==\nThere are many parks in Potsdam, most of them UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Among their attractions are:\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Sports ==\n1.

        "wiki": "The  Roman Baths (German: die R\u00f6mischen B\u00e4der), situated northeast of the Charlottenhof Palace in the Sanssouci Park in Potsdam, reflect the Italiensehnsucht (\"Sehnsucht/longing for Italy\") of its creator Frederick William IV of Prussia. Various classical Roman and antique Italian styles were melded into an architectural ensemble, created between 1829 and 1840.\n\nWhile still crown prince, Frederick William commissioned both Charlottenhof (1826-1829) and the Roman Baths (1834-1840). Coming up with numerous ideas and drawing many actual drafts, the artistically inclined heir to the throne had considerable influence on the plans of the architect, Karl Friedrich Schinkel.  Charged with managing the actual construction was one of Schinkel's students, Ludwig Persius.\nThe gardener's house (G\u00e4rtnerhaus) (1829\u201330) and the adjacent house for the gardener's helpers (G\u00e4rtnergehilfenhaus) (1832) were both built in Italian country villa style (Landhausstil). The Roman Bath, which gave its name to the ensemble in its entirety, was styled after ancient villas.  Together with a small tea pavilion (Teepavillon) (1830), modelled on temples of classical antiquity, they form a complex of buildings tied together by pergolas, arcades and garden spaces.  The individual buildings were largely inspired by Schinkel's second trip to Italy in 1828.\nThus the Roman Bath, which has never actually been used as a bathing facility, came into being thanks purely to the romantic fantasy of the royal Italophile.\n\nThe names of the rooms connote a mixture of antique villas and Roman baths. The atrium, the courtyard of a Roman house, is the reception area.  The Impluvium, actually only a glorified rainwater-collection device, gives its name to the whole room in which it is located. The Viridarium (greenhouse) is actually a small garden.\nAdditional names associated with Roman thermal baths are Apodyterium for the changing room and Caldarium.\nThe whole nostalgic creation is on the bank of an artificial lake created during Peter Joseph Lenn\u00e9's landscaping of the Charlottenhof grounds. The so-called machine pond (Maschinenteich) gets its name from a steam engine building and an adjacent pumping station torn down in 1923.  The large hull of a well marks the location of the former building.  The steam engine was not just responsible for keeping the artificial waters of Charlottenhof moving \u2013 its smokestacks were also a symbol of progress and what was at its time advanced technology.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nGert Streidt, Klaus Frahm: Potsdam.

        "wiki": "The Ministry for State Security (German: Ministerium f\u00fcr Staatssicherheit, MfS) or State Security Service (Staatssicherheitsdienst, SSD), commonly known as the Stasi (IPA: [\u02c8\u0283ta\u02d0zi\u02d0]), was the official state security service of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). It has been described as one of the most effective and repressive intelligence and secret police agencies ever to have existed. The Stasi was headquartered in East Berlin, with an extensive complex in Berlin-Lichtenberg and several smaller facilities throughout the city. The Stasi motto was Schild und Schwert der Partei (Shield and Sword of the Party), referring to the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands, SED) and also echoing a theme of the KGB, the Soviet counterpart and close partner, with respect to its own ruling party, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). Erich Mielke was the Stasi's longest-serving chief, in power for 32 years of the GDR's 40 years of existence.\nOne of its main tasks was spying on the population, primarily through a vast network of citizens turned informants, and fighting any opposition by overt and covert measures, including hidden psychological destruction of dissidents (Zersetzung, literally meaning \"decomposition\"). It arrested 250,000 people as political prisoners during its existence. Its Main Directorate for Reconnaissance (Hauptverwaltung Aufkl\u00e4rung) was responsible for both espionage and for conducting covert operations in foreign countries. Under its long-time head Markus Wolf, this directorate gained a reputation as one of the most effective intelligence agencies of the Cold War. The Stasi also maintained contacts, and occasionally cooperated, with Western terrorists.Numerous Stasi officials were prosecuted for their crimes after 1990. After German reunification, the surveillance files that the Stasi had maintained on millions of East Germans were opened, so that any citizen could inspect their personal file on request. These files are now maintained by the Stasi Records Agency.\n\n\n== Creation ==\nThe Stasi was founded on 8 February 1950. Wilhelm Zaisser was the first Minister of State Security of the GDR, and Erich Mielke was his deputy. Zaisser tried to depose SED General Secretary Walter Ulbricht after the June 1953 uprising, but was instead removed by Ulbricht and replaced with Ernst Wollweber thereafter. Following the  June 1953 uprising, the Politb\u00fcro decided to downgrade the apparatus to a State Secretariat and incorporate it under the Ministry of Interior under the leadership of Willi Stoph. The Minister of State Security simultaneously became a State Secretary of State Security. The Stasi held this status until November 1955, when was restored to a ministry. Wollweber resigned in 1957 after clashes with Ulbricht and Erich Honecker, and was succeeded by his deputy, Erich Mielke.\nIn 1957, Markus Wolf became head of the Hauptverwaltung Aufkl\u00e4rung (HVA) (Main Reconnaissance Administration), the foreign intelligence section of the Stasi. As intelligence chief, Wolf achieved great success in penetrating the government, political and business circles of West Germany with spies. The most influential case was that of G\u00fcnter Guillaume, which led to the downfall of West German Chancellor Willy Brandt in May 1974. In 1986, Wolf retired and was succeeded by Werner Grossmann.\n\n\n== Relationship with the KGB ==\n\nAlthough Mielke's Stasi was superficially granted independence in 1957, until 1990 the KGB continued to maintain liaison officers in all eight main Stasi directorates, each with his own office inside the Stasi's Berlin compound, and in each of the fifteen Stasi district headquarters around East Germany. Collaboration was so close that the KGB invited the Stasi to establish operational bases in Moscow and Leningrad to monitor visiting East German tourists and Mielke referred to the Stasi officers as \"Chekists of the Soviet Union\". In 1978, Mielke formally granted KGB officers in East Germany the same rights and powers that they enjoyed in the Soviet Union.\n\n\n== Organization ==\nThe Ministry for State Security was organized according to the Line principle. A high-ranking official was in charge of a particular mission of the Ministry and headed a division in the Central Apparatus (Zentrale). A corresponding division was organized in each of the 15 District Departments for State Security (Bezirksverwaltungen f\u00fcr Staatssicherheit in the Berlin Capital Region and 14 regional districts (Bezirke)). At the local level the Stasi had Area Precincts for State Security (Bezirksverwaltungen f\u00fcr Staatssicherheit - one each for the 227 cities and municipal districts and the 11 city boroughs (Stadtbezirken) of East Berlin). A single case officer held responsibility for the particular mission in each area precinct. The line principle meant that the case officers were subordinated to the specialized divisions at the district departments. The specialized divisions at the district departments were subordinated to the specialized division in the central apparatus and the whole line was under the direct command and control of the high-ranking Stasi officer in charge of the mission. The Stasi also fielded Location Detachments (Objektdienststellen) at state-owned enterprises of high importance (such as the joint USSR-East German Wismar uranium mining company). Shortly before the transformation of the Stasi into the Office of National Security the Ministry had the following structure:\n\n\n=== Ministry for State Security ===\nMinister for State Security\nPolicy Board (Kollegium des MfS, included the Minister and his deputies)\n\n\n==== Central Apparatus ====\nCentral Apparatus (Zentrale)\nDivisions directly subordinated to the Minister Army general Erich Mielke (Dem Minister f\u00fcr Staatssicherheit direkt unterstellte Diensteinheiten)\n\nOffice of the Minister (Sekretariat des Ministers)\nMain Division II (Hauptabteilung II) - Counter-intelligence\nDivision M (Abteilung M) - Postal control\nMain Division IX (Hauptabteilung IX) - Investigative body\nDivision X (Abteilung X) - International liaison with partner agencies from the Socialist Bloc\nDivision XIV (Abteilung XIV) - Criminal prosecution and Stasi prisons\nExecutive Group of the Minister (Arbeitsgruppe des Ministers)\nFelix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment (Wachregiment Berlin \"Feliks E.

of mail and telephone communications.\nAdministration 2000 was responsible for the reliability of National People's Army (Nationale Volksarmee, NVA) personnel. Administration 2000 operated a secret, unofficial network of informants within the NVA. Administration 2000 was the name of the division in NVA documentation. Its actual Stasi name was Main Division I.\nAdministration for Security of Heavy Industry and Research and Main Administration for Security of the Economy: protection against sabotage or espionage.\nDivision of Garbage Analysis: was responsible for analyzing garbage for any suspect western foods and/or materials.\nFelix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment: the armed force at disposal of the ministry, named for the founder of the Cheka, the Bolshevik secret police. The members of this regiment, who served at least three years, were responsible for protecting high government and party buildings and personnel. The regiment was composed of six motorized rifle battalions, one artillery battalion, and one training battalion. Its equipment included PSZH-IV armored personnel carriers, 120 mm mortars, 85 mm and 100 mm antitank guns, ZU-23 antiaircraft guns, and helicopters. A Swiss source reported in 1986 that the troops of the Ministry of State Security also had commando units similar to the Soviet Union's Spetsnaz GRU forces. These East German units were said to wear the uniform of the airborne troops, although with the violet collar patch of the Ministry for State Security rather than the orange one of paratroopers. They also wore the sleeve stripe of the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment.\nGuard and Security Unit (Wach- und Sicherungseinheit (WSE)) each of the 15 district departments had its own GSU, directly subordinated to the district department chief. The manpower of the units ranged roughly between 200 and 400 men. They had four roles - security of the Stasi headquarters in the district, combat training of personnel of the district department, initial posting for newly appointed Stasi officers for a couple of years until their careers advance to specialized positions and (most importantly) Quick Reaction Alert tactical intervention units. As such the GSUs were armed and equipped as motor rifle units with APCs, automatic rifles, grenade launchers etc.\nHVA: focused its efforts primarily on West Germany and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, but it also operated East German intelligence in all foreign countries.\nMain Administration for Struggle Against Suspicious Persons was charged with the surveillance of foreigners\u2014particularly from the West\u2014legally traveling or residing within the country. This included the diplomatic community, tourists, and official guests.\nMain Coordinating Administration of the Ministry for State Security: coordinated its work with Soviet intelligence agencies.\nMain Department for Communications Security and Personnel Protection: provided personal security for the national leadership and maintained and operated an internal secure communications system for the government.\nPenal System: to facilitate its mission of enforcing the political security of East Germany, the Stasi operated its own penal system, distinct from that of the Ministry of the Interior. This system comprised prison camps for political, as opposed to criminal, offenders.\n\n\n== Operations ==\n\n\n=== Personnel and recruitment ===\n\nBetween 1950 and 1989, the Stasi employed a total of 274,000 people in an effort to root out the class enemy. In 1989, the Stasi employed 91,015 people full-time, including 2,000 fully employed unofficial collaborators, 13,073 soldiers and 2,232 officers of GDR army, along with 173,081 unofficial informants inside GDR and 1,553 informants in West Germany.Regular commissioned Stasi officers were recruited from conscripts who had been honourably discharged from their 18 months' compulsory military service, had been members of the SED, had had a high level of participation in the Party's youth wing's activities and had been Stasi informers during their service in the Military. The candidates would then have to be recommended by their military unit political officers and Stasi agents, the local chiefs of the District (Bezirk) Stasi and Volkspolizei office, of the district in which they were permanently resident, and the District Secretary of the SED. These candidates were then made to sit through several tests and exams, which identified their intellectual capacity to be an officer, and their political reliability. University graduates who had completed their military service did not need to take these tests and exams. They then attended a two-year officer training programme at the Stasi college (Hochschule) in Potsdam. Less mentally and academically endowed candidates were made ordinary technicians and attended a one-year technology-intensive course for non-commissioned officers.\nBy 1995, some 174,000 inoffizielle Mitarbeiter (IMs) Stasi informants had been identified, almost 2.5% of East Germany's population between the ages of 18 and 60. 10,000 IMs were under 18 years of age. From the volume of material destroyed in the final days of the regime, the office of the Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records (BStU) believes that there could have been as many as 500,000 informers. A former Stasi colonel who served in the counterintelligence directorate estimated that the figure could be as high as 2 million if occasional informants were included. There is significant debate about how many IMs were actually employed.\n\n\n=== Infiltration ===\nFull-time officers were posted to all major industrial plants (the extensiveness of any surveillance largely depended on how valuable a product was to the economy) and one tenant in every apartment building was designated as a watchdog reporting to an area representative of the Volkspolizei (Vopo). Spies reported every relative or friend who stayed the night at another's apartment. Tiny holes were drilled in apartment and hotel room walls through which Stasi agents filmed citizens with special video cameras. Schools, universities, and hospitals were extensively infiltrated, as were organizations, such as computer clubs where teenagers exchanged Western video games.The Stasi had formal categorizations of each type of informant, and had official guidelines on how to extract information from, and control, those with whom they came into contact. The roles of informants ranged from those already in some way involved in state security (such as the police and the armed services) to those in the dissident movements (such as in the arts and the Protestant Church). Information gathered about the latter groups was frequently used to divide or discredit members. Informants were made to feel important, given material or social incentives, and were imbued with a sense of adventure, and only around 7.7%, according to official figures, were coerced into cooperating. A significant proportion of those informing were members of the SED. Use of some form of blackmail was not uncommon. A large number of Stasi informants were tram conductors, janitors, doctors, nurses and teachers. Mielke believed that the best informants were those whose jobs entailed frequent contact with the public.The Stasi's ranks swelled considerably after Eastern Bloc countries signed the 1975 Helsinki accords, which GDR leader Erich Honecker viewed as a grave threat to his regime because they contained language binding signatories to respect \"human and basic rights, including freedom of thought, conscience, religion, and conviction\". The number of IMs peaked at around 180,000 in that year, having slowly risen from 20,000\u201330,000 in the early 1950s, and reaching 100,000 for the first time in 1968, in response to Ostpolitik and protests worldwide. The Stasi also acted as a proxy for KGB to conduct activities in other Eastern Bloc countries, such as Poland, where the Soviets were despised.The Stasi infiltrated almost every aspect of GDR life. In the mid-1980s, a network of IMs began growing in both German states. By the time that East Germany collapsed in 1989, the Stasi employed 91,015 employees and 173,081 informants. About one out of every 63 East Germans collaborated with the Stasi. By at least one estimate, the Stasi maintained greater surveillance over its own people than any secret police force in history. The Stasi employed one secret policeman for every 166 East Germans. By comparison, the Gestapo deployed one secret policeman per 2,000 people. As ubiquitous as this was, the ratios swelled when informers were factored in: counting part-time informers, the Stasi had one agent per 6.5 people. This comparison led Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal to call the Stasi even more oppressive than the Gestapo. Stasi agents infiltrated and undermined West Germany's government and spy agencies.In some cases, spouses even spied on each other. A high-profile example of this was peace activist Vera Lengsfeld, whose husband, Knud Wollenberger, was a Stasi informant.\n\n\n=== Zersetzung ===\n\nThe Stasi perfected the technique of psychological harassment of perceived enemies known as Zersetzung (pronounced [\u02a6\u025b\u0250\u032f\u02c8z\u025bts\u028a\u014b]) \u2013 a term borrowed from chemistry which literally means \"decomposition\".\n\nBy the 1970s, the Stasi had decided that the methods of overt persecution that had been employed up to that time, such as arrest and torture, were too crude and obvious. It was realised that psychological harassment was far less likely to be recognised for what it was, so its victims, and their supporters, were less likely to be provoked into active resistance, given that they would often not be aware of the source of their problems, or even its exact nature. Zersetzung was designed to side-track and \"switch off\" perceived enemies so that they would lose the will to continue any \"inappropriate\" activities.\nTactics employed under Zersetzung generally involved the disruption of the victim's private or family life. This often included psychological attacks, such as breaking into homes and subtly manipulating the contents, in a form of gaslighting \u2013 moving furniture, altering the timing of an alarm, removing pictures from walls or replacing one variety of tea with another. Other practices included property damage, sabotage of cars, purposely incorrect medical treatment, smear campaigns including sending falsified compromising photos or documents to the victim's family, denunciation, provocation, psychological warfare, psychological subversion, wiretapping, bugging, mysterious phone calls or unnecessary deliveries, even including sending a vibrator to a target's wife. Usually, victims had no idea that the Stasi were responsible. Many thought that they were losing their minds, and mental breakdowns and suicide could result.\nOne great advantage of the harassment perpetrated under Zersetzung was that its subtle nature meant that it was able to be plausibly denied. This was important given that the GDR was trying to improve its international standing during the 1970s and 80s, especially in conjunction with the Ostpolitik of West German Chancellor Willy Brandt massively improving relations between the two German states.\n\n\n== International operations ==\n\nAfter German reunification, revelations of the Stasi's international activities were publicized, such as its military training of the West German Red Army Faction.\n\n\n=== Examples ===\nStasi experts helped train the secret police organization of Mengistu Haile Mariam in Ethiopia.\nFidel Castro's regime in Cuba was particularly interested in receiving training from the Stasi. Stasi instructors worked in Cuba and Cuban communists received training in East Germany. The Stasi chief Markus Wolf described how he set up the Cuban system on the pattern of the East German system.\nStasi officers helped in initial training and indoctrination of Egyptian State Security organizations under the Nasser regime from 1957\u201358 onwards. This was discontinued by Anwar Sadat in 1976.\nThe Stasi's experts worked with building secret police systems in the People's Republic of Angola, the People's Republic of Mozambique, and the People's Republic of Yemen (South Yemen).\nThe Stasi organized and extensively trained Syrian intelligence services under the regime of Hafez al-Assad and Ba'ath Party from 1966 onwards and especially from 1973.\nStasi experts helped to set up Idi Amin's secret police.\nStasi experts helped the President of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah, to set up his secret police. When Nkrumah was ousted by a military coup, Stasi Major J\u00fcrgen Rogalla was imprisoned.\nThe Stasi sent agents to the West as sleeper agents. For instance, sleeper agent G\u00fcnter Guillaume became a senior aide to social democratic chancellor Willy Brandt, and reported about his politics and private life.\nThe Stasi operated at least one brothel. Agents were used against both men and women working in Western governments. \"Entrapment\" was used against married men and homosexuals.\nMartin Schlaff \u2013 According to the German parliament's investigations, the Austrian billionaire's Stasi codename was \"Landgraf\" and registration number \"3886-86\". He made money by supplying embargoed goods to East Germany.\nSokratis Kokkalis \u2013 Stasi documents suggest that the Greek businessman was a Stasi agent, whose operations included delivering Western technological secrets and bribing Greek officials to buy outdated East German telecom equipment.\nRed Army Faction (Baader-Meinhof Group)\u2014A terrorist organization which killed dozens of West Germans and others, which received financial and logistical support from the Stasi, as well as shelter and new identities.\nThe Stasi ordered a campaign in which cemeteries and other Jewish sites in West Germany were smeared with swastikas and other Nazi symbols. Funds were channelled to a small West German group for it to defend Adolf Eichmann.\nThe Stasi channelled large amounts of money to Neo-Nazi groups in West, with the purpose of discrediting the West.\nThe Stasi allowed the wanted West German Neo-Nazi Odfried Hepp to hide in East Germany and then provided him with a new identity so that he could live in the Middle East.\nThe Stasi worked in a campaign to create extensive material and propaganda against Israel.\nMurder of Benno Ohnesorg \u2013 A Stasi informant in the West Berlin police, Karl-Heinz Kurras, fatally shot an unarmed demonstrator, which stirred a whole movement of Marxist radicalism, protest, and terrorist violence. The Economist describes it as \"the gunshot that hoaxed a generation\". The surviving Stasi Records contain no evidence that Kurras was acting under their orders when he shot Ohnesorg.\nOperation Infektion\u2014The Stasi helped the KGB to spread HIV/AIDS disinformation that the United States had created the disease. Millions of people around the world still believe in these claims.\nSandoz chemical spill\u2014The KGB reportedly ordered the Stasi to sabotage the chemical factory to distract attention from the Chernobyl disaster six months earlier in Ukraine.\nInvestigators have found evidence of a death squad that carried out a number of assassinations (including assassination of Swedish journalist Cats Falck) on orders from the East German government from 1976 to 1987. Attempts to prosecute members failed.\nThe Stasi attempted to assassinate Wolfgang Welsch, a famous critic of the regime. Stasi collaborator Peter Haack (Stasi codename \"Alfons\") befriended Welsch and then fed him hamburgers poisoned with thallium. It took weeks for doctors to find out why Welsch had suddenly lost his hair.\nDocuments in the Stasi archives state that the KGB ordered Bulgarian agents to assassinate Pope John Paul II, who was known for his criticism of human rights in the Communist bloc, and the Stasi was asked to help with covering up traces.\nA special unit of the Stasi assisted Romanian intelligence in kidnapping Romanian dissident Oliviu Beldeanu from West Germany.\nThe Stasi in 1972 made plans to assist the Vietnam People's Public Security in improving its intelligence work during the Vietnam War.\nIn 1975, the Stasi recorded a conversation between senior West German CDU politicians Helmut Kohl and Kurt Biedenkopf. It was then \"leaked\" to the Stern magazine as a transcript recorded by American intelligence. The magazine then claimed that Americans were wiretapping West Germans and the public believed the story.\n\n\n== Fall of the Soviet Union ==\nRecruitment of informants became increasingly difficult towards the end of the GDR's existence, and, after 1986, there was a negative turnover rate of IMs. This had a significant impact on the Stasi's ability to survey the populace, in a period of growing unrest, and knowledge of the Stasi's activities became more widespread. Stasi had been tasked during this period with preventing the country's economic difficulties becoming a political problem, through suppression of the very worst problems the state faced, but it failed to do so.Stasi officers reportedly had discussed re-branding East Germany as a democratic capitalist country to the West, which in actuality would have been taken over by Stasi officers. The plan specified 2,587 OibE officers (Offiziere im besonderen Einsatz, \"officers on special assignment\") who would have assumed power as detailed in the Top Secret Document 0008-6/86 of 17 March 1986. According to Ion Mihai Pacepa, the chief intelligence officer in communist Romania, other communist intelligence services had similar plans. On 12 March 1990, Der Spiegel reported that the Stasi was indeed attempting to implement 0008-6/86. Pacepa has noted that what happened in Russia and how KGB Colonel Vladimir Putin took over Russia resembles these plans. See Putinism.\nOn 7 November 1989, in response to the rapidly changing political and social situation in the GDR in late 1989, Erich Mielke resigned. On 17 November 1989, the Council of Ministers (Ministerrat der DDR) renamed the Stasi the \"Office for National Security\" (Amt f\u00fcr Nationale Sicherheit \u2013 AfNS), which was headed by Generalleutnant Wolfgang Schwanitz. On 8 December 1989, GDR Prime Minister Hans Modrow directed the dissolution of the AfNS, which was confirmed by a decision of the Ministerrat on 14 December 1989.\nAs part of this decision, the Ministerrat originally called for the evolution of the AfNS into two separate organizations: a new foreign intelligence service (Nachrichtendienst der DDR) and an \"Office for the Protection of the Constitution of the GDR\" (Verfassungsschutz der DDR), along the lines of the West German Bundesamt f\u00fcr Verfassungsschutz, however, the public reaction was extremely negative, and under pressure from the \"Round Table\" (Runder Tisch), the government dropped the creation of the Verfassungsschutz der DDR and directed the immediate dissolution of the AfNS on 13 January 1990. Certain functions of the AfNS reasonably related to law enforcement were handed over to the GDR Ministry of Internal Affairs. The same ministry also took guardianship of remaining AfNS facilities.\nWhen the parliament of Germany investigated public funds that disappeared after the Fall of the Berlin Wall, it found out that East Germany had transferred large amounts of money to Martin Schlaff through accounts in Vaduz, the capital of Liechtenstein, in return for goods \"under Western embargo\".\nMoreover, high-ranking Stasi officers continued their post-GDR careers in management positions in Schlaff's group of companies. For example, in 1990, Herbert Kohler, Stasi commander in Dresden, transferred 170 million marks to Schlaff for \"harddisks\" and months later went to work for him.\nThe investigations concluded that \"Schlaff's empire of companies played a crucial role\" in the Stasi attempts to secure the financial future of Stasi agents and keep the intelligence network alive.\nThe Stern magazine noted that KGB officer (and future Russian President) Vladimir Putin worked with his Stasi colleagues in Dresden in 1989.\n\n\n== Recovery of Stasi files ==\nDuring the Peaceful Revolution of 1989, Stasi offices and prisons throughout the country were occupied by citizens, but not before the Stasi destroyed a number of documents (approximately 5%) consisting of, by one calculation, 1 billion sheets of paper.\n\n\n=== Storming the Stasi headquarters ===\n\nWith the fall of the GDR the Stasi was dissolved. Stasi employees began to destroy the extensive files and documents they held, by hand, fire and with the use of shredders. When these activities became known, a protest began in front of the Stasi headquarters, The evening of 15 January 1990 saw a large crowd form outside the gates calling for a stop to the destruction of sensitive files. The building contained vast records of personal files, many of which would form important evidence in convicting those who had committed crimes for the Stasi. The protesters continued to grow in number until they were able to overcome the police and gain entry into the complex. Once inside, specific targets of the protesters' anger were portraits of Erich Honecker and Erich Mielke which were trampled on or burnt. Among the protesters were former Stasi collaborators seeking to destroy incriminating documents.\n\n\n=== Controversy of the Stasi files ===\nWith the German reunification on 3 October 1990, a new government agency was founded called the Federal Commissioner for the Records of the State Security Service of the former German Democratic Republic (German: Der Bundesbeauftragte f\u00fcr die Unterlagen des Staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen Deutschen Demokratischen Republik), officially abbreviated \"BStU\". There was a debate about what should happen to the files, whether they should be opened to the people or kept closed.\nThose who opposed opening the files cited privacy as a reason. They felt that the information in the files would lead to negative feelings about former Stasi members, and, in turn, cause violence. Pastor Rainer Eppelmann, who became Minister of Defense and Disarmament after March 1990, felt that new political freedoms for former Stasi members would be jeopardized by acts of revenge. Prime Minister Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re even went so far as to predict murder. They also argued against the use of the files to capture former Stasi members and prosecute them, arguing that not all former members were criminals and should not be punished solely for being a member. There were also some who believed that everyone was guilty of something. Peter-Michael Diestel, the Minister of Interior, opined that these files could not be used to determine innocence and guilt, claiming that \"there were only two types of individuals who were truly innocent in this system, the newborn and the alcoholic\". Other opinions, such as the one of West German Interior Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, believed in putting the Stasi behind them and working on German reunification.\n\nOthers argued that everyone should have the right to see their own file, and that the files should be opened to investigate former Stasi members and prosecute them, as well as not allow them to hold office. Opening the files would also help clear up some of the rumors that were currently circulating. Some also believed that politicians involved with the Stasi should be investigated.\nThe fate of the files was finally decided under the Unification Treaty between the GDR and West Germany. This treaty took the Volkskammer law further and allowed more access and use of the files. Along with the decision to keep the files in a central location in the East, they also decided who could see and use the files, allowing people to see their own files.\nIn 1992, following a declassification ruling by the German government, the Stasi files were opened, leading people to look for their files. Timothy Garton Ash, an English historian, after reading his file, wrote The File: A Personal History.Between 1991 and 2011, around 2.75 million individuals, mostly GDR citizens, requested to see their own files. The ruling also gave people the ability to make duplicates of their documents. Another big issue was how the media could use and benefit from the documents. It was decided that the media could obtain files as long as they were depersonalized and not regarding an individual under the age of 18 or a former Stasi member. This ruling not only gave the media access to the files, but also gave schools access.\n\n\n=== Tracking down former Stasi informers with the files ===\nEven though groups of this sort were active in the community, those who were tracking down ex-members were, as well. Many of these hunters succeeded in catching ex-Stasi; however, charges could not be made for merely being a member. The person in question would have to have participated in an illegal act, not just be a registered Stasi member. Among the high-profile individuals who were arrested and tried were Erich Mielke, Third Minister of State Security of the GDR, and Erich Honecker, head of state for the GDR. Mielke was sentenced to six years prison for the murder of two policemen in 1931. Honecker was charged with authorizing the killing of would-be escapees on the east\u2013west frontier and the Berlin Wall. During his trial, he went through cancer treatment. Because he was nearing death, Honecker was allowed to spend his final time in freedom. He died in Chile in May 1994.\n\n\n=== Reassembling the destroyed files ===\nReassembling the destroyed files has been relatively easy due to the number of archives and the failure of shredding machines (in some cases \"shredding\" meant tearing paper in two by hand and documents could be recovered easily). In 1995, the BStU began reassembling the shredded documents; 13 years later, the three dozen archivists commissioned to the projects had only reassembled 327 bags; they are now using computer-assisted data recovery to reassemble the remaining 16,000 bags \u2013 estimated at 45 million pages. It is estimated that this task may be completed at a cost of 30 million dollars.The CIA acquired some Stasi records during the looting of the Stasi's archives. West Germany asked for their return and received some in April 2000. See also Rosenholz files.\n\n\n== Museums ==\n\nThere a number of memorial sites and museums relating to the Stasi in former Stasi prisons and administration buildings. In addition, offices of the Stasi Records Agency in Berlin, Dresden, Erfurt, Frankfurt-an-der-Oder and Halle (Saale) all have permanent and changing exhibitions relating to the activities of the Stasi in their region.\n\n\n=== Berlin ===\nStasi Museum (Berlin) -  This is located at Ruschestra\u00dfe 103, in  \"Haus 1\" on the former Stasi headquarters compound. The office of Erich Mielke, the head of the Stasi, was in this building and it has been preserved along with a number of other rooms. The building was occupied by protesters on 15 January 1990. On 7 November 1990, a Research Centre and Memorial was opened, which now called the Stasi Museum.\nBerlin-Hohensch\u00f6nhausen Memorial - A memorial to repression during both the Soviet occupation and GDR era in a former prison that was used by both regimes. The building was a Soviet prison from 1946, and from 1951 until 1989 it was a Stasi remand centre. It officially closed on 3 October 1990, the day of German reunification. The museum and memorial site opened in 1994. It is in Alt-Hohensch\u00f6nhausen, in Lichtenberg in north-east Berlin.\n\n\n=== Erfurt ===\n\nMemorial and Education Centre Andreasstrasse - a museum in Erfurt which is housed in a former Stasi remand prison. From 1952 until 1989, over 5000 political prisoners were held on remand and interrogated in the Andreasstrasse prison, which was one of 17 Stasi remand prisons in the GDR. On 4 December 1989, local citizens occupied the prison and the neighbouring Stasi district headquarters to stop the mass destruction of Stasi files. It was the first time East Germans had undertaken such resistance against the Stasi and it instigated the take over of Stasi buildings throughout the country.\n\n\n=== Dresden ===\n\nGedenkst\u00e4tte Bautzner Stra\u00dfe Dresden (The Bautzner Strasse Memorial in Dresden) - A Stasi remand prison and the Stasi's regional head office in Dresden. It was used as a prison by the Soviet occupying forces from 1945 to 1953, and from 1953 to 1989 by the Stasi. The Stasi held and interrogated between 12,000 and 15,000 people during the time they used the prison. The building was originally a 19th-century paper mill. It was converted into a block of flats in 1933 before being confiscated by the Soviet army in 1945. The Stasi prison and offices were occupied by local citizens on 5 December 1989, during a wave of such takeovers across the country. The museum and memorial site was opened to the public in 1994.\n\n\n=== Frankfurt-an-der-Oder ===\nRemembrance and Documentation Centre for \"Victims of political tyranny\" - A memorial and museum at Collegienstra\u00dfe 10 in Frankfurt-an-der-Oder, in  a building that was used as a detention centre by the Gestapo, the Soviet occupying forces and the Stasi. The building was the Stasi district offices and a remand prison from 1950 until 1969, after which the Volkspolizei used the prison. From 1950 to 1952 it was an execution site where 12 people sentenced to death were executed. The prison closed in 1990. It has been a cultural centre and a memorial to the victims of political tyranny since June 1994, managed by the Museum Viadrina.\n\n\n=== Gera ===\nGedenkst\u00e4tte Amthordurchgang, a memorial and 'centre of encounter' in Gera in a former remand prison, originally opened in 1874, that was used by the Gestapo from 1933-1945, the Soviet occupying forces from 1945 to 1949, and from 1952 to 1989 by the Stasi. The building was also the district offices of the Stasi administration. Between 1952 and 1989 over 2,800 people were held in the prison on political grounds. The memorial site opened with the official name \"Die Gedenk- und Begegnungsst\u00e4tte im Torhaus der politischen Haftanstalt von 1933 bis 1945 und 1945 bis 1989\" in November 2005.\n\n\n=== Halle (Saale) ===\nThe Roter Ochse (Red Ox) is a museum and memorial site at the prison at Am Kirchtor 20,  Halle (Saale). Part of the prison, built 1842, was used by the Stasi from 1950 until 1989, during with time over 9,000 political prisoners were held in the prison. From 1954 it was mainly used for women prisoners. The name \"Roter Ochse\" is the informal name of the prison, possibly originating in the 19th century from the colour of the external walls. It still operates as a prison for young people. Since 1996, the building which was used as an interrogation centre by the Stasi and an execution site by the Nazis has been a museum and memorial centre for victims of political persecution.\n\n\n=== Leipzig ===\n\nGedenkst\u00e4tte Museum in der \u201eRunden Ecke\u201c (Memorial Museum in the \"Round Corner\") - The former Stasi district headquarters on am Dittrichring is now a museum focusing on the history and activities of the organisation. It is named after the curved shape of the front of the building. The Stasi used the building from 1950 until 1989. On the evening of 4 December 1989, it was occupied by protesters in order to stop the destruction of Stasi files. There has been a permanent exhibition on the site since 1990. The building also houses the Leipzig branch of the Stasi Records Agency, which holds about 10 km of files on its shelves.\nStasi-Bunker L\u00fcbsch\u00fctzer Teiche (Stasi Bunker Museum) - The Stasi Bunker Museum is in Machern, a village about 30 km from Leipzig. It is managed by the Runde Ecke Museum administration. The bunker was built from 1968 to 1972, as a fallout shelter for the staff of the Stasi's Leipzig administration in case of a nuclear attack. It could accommodate about 120 people. The bunker, which was disguised as a holiday resort on 5.2 hectares of land, was only discovered in December in 1989. It is completely preserved in its original state. \"The emergency command centre was a secretly-created complex, designed to maintain the Stasi leadership's hold on power, even in exceptional circumstances.\" The whole grounds are classified as a historic monument and are open to the public on the last weekend of every month, and for pre-arranged group tours at other times.\nGDR Execution site - The execution site at Alfred-K\u00e4stner-Stra\u00dfe in south Leipzig, was the central site in East Germany where the death penalty was carried out from 1960 until 1981. It remains in its original condition. The management of the \"Runde Ecke\" Museum opens the site once a year on \"Museum night\" and on special state-wide days when historic buildings and sites that are not normally accessible to the public are opened.\n\n\n=== Magdeburg ===\nGedenkst\u00e4tte Moritzplatz Magdeburg - The memorial site at Mortzplatz in Magdeburg is a museum on the site of a former prison, built from 1873-1876, that was used by the Soviet administration from 1945-1949 and the Stasi from 1958 until 1989 to hold political prisoners. Between 1950 and 1958 the Stasi shared another prison with the civil police. The prison at Moritzplatz was used by the Volkspolizei from 1952 until 1958. Between 1945 and 1989, more than 10,000 political prisoners were held in the prison. The memorial site and museum was founded in December 1990.\n\n\n=== Potsdam ===\n\nGedenkst\u00e4tte Lindenstra\u00dfe The memorial site and museum at Lindenstra\u00dfe 54/55 in Potsdam, examines political persecution in the Nazi, Soviet occupation and GDR eras. The original building was built 1733-1737 as a baroque palace; it became a court and prison in 1820. From 1933, the Nazi regime held political prisoners there, many of whom were arrested for racial reasons, for example Jews who refused to wear the yellow star on their clothing.The Soviet administration took over the prison in 1945, also using it as a prison for holding political prisoners on remand. The Stasi then used it as a remand prison, mainly for political prisoners from 1952 until 1989. Over 6,000 people were held in the prison by the Stasi during that time. On 27 October 1989, the prison freed all political prisoners due to a nationwide amnesty. On 5 December 1989, the Stasi Headquarters in Potsdam and the Lindenstrasse Prison were occupied by protesters. From January 1990 the building was used as offices for various citizens initiatives and new political groups, such as the Neue Forum. The building was opened to the public from 20 January 1990 and people were taken on tours of the site. It officially became a Memorial site in 1995.\n\n\n=== Rostock ===\nDocumentation Centre and Memorial site, former Stasi remand prison, Rostock - The memorial site is in a former Stasi remand prison at Hermanstrasse 34b. It is on what was part of a Stasi compound in Rostock, where its district headquarters were also located. Most of the site is now used by the Rostock county court and the University of Rostock. The complex was built 1958-1960. The remand prison was used by the Stasi from 1960 until 1989. About 4,900 people were held in the prison during that time, most of them were political prisoners. Most of prisoners were released after an amnesty issued on 27 October 1989. The Stasi prison in the Rostock compound was occupied by protesters on 4 December 1989 following a wave of such occupation across East Germany starting in Erfurt on the same day.The prison closed in the early 1990s. The state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern took ownership of it in 1998, and the memorial site and museum were established in 1999. An extensive restoration of the site began in December 2018.\n\n\n== Stasi officers after the reunification ==\n\n\n=== Recruitment by Russian state-owned companies ===\nFormer Stasi agent Matthias Warnig (codename \"Arthur\") is currently the CEO of Nord Stream.\nGerman investigations have revealed that some of the key Gazprom Germania managers are former Stasi agents.\n\n\n=== Lobbying ===\nFormer Stasi officers continue to be politically active via the Gesellschaft zur Rechtlichen und Humanit\u00e4ren Unterst\u00fctzung (GRH, Society for Legal and Humanitarian Support). Former high-ranking officers and employees of the Stasi, including the last Stasi director, Wolfgang Schwanitz, make up the majority of the organization's members, and it receives support from the German Communist Party, among others.\nImpetus for the establishment of the GRH was provided by the criminal charges filed against the Stasi in the early 1990s. The GRH, decrying the charges as \"victor's justice\", called for them to be dropped. Today the group provides an alternative if somewhat utopian voice in the public debate on the GDR legacy. It calls for the closure of the Berlin-Hohensch\u00f6nhausen Memorial and can be a vocal presence at memorial services and public events. In March 2006 in Berlin, GRH members disrupted a museum event; a political scandal ensued when the Berlin Senator (Minister) of Culture refused to confront them.Behind the scenes, the GRH also lobbies people and institutions promoting opposing viewpoints. For example, in March 2006, the Berlin Senator for Education received a letter from a GRH member and former Stasi officer attacking the Museum for promoting \"falsehoods, anticommunist agitation and psychological terror against minors\". Similar letters have also been received by schools organizing field trips to the museum.\n\n\n== Stasi agents ==\nChristel Boom\nGabriele Gast\nG\u00fcnter Guillaume\nKarl-Heinz Kurras\nLilli P\u00f6ttrich\nRainer Rupp\nHans Sommer\nWerner Teske\n\n\n== Alleged informants ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nBarkas (van manufacturer)\nDeutschland 83 and Deutschland 86\nFelix Dzerzhinsky Watch Regiment\nStasi Records Agency\nStasiland\nThe Lives of Others, movie centered on the Stasi\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBlumenau, Bernhard. \u2018Unholy Alliance: The Connection between the East German Stasi and the Right-Wing Terrorist Odfried Hepp\u2019.

          "I have been to Potsdam several times and have always missed going here. From the outside it looks like an ordinary villa, but behind is an entire prison. The thought that this was in use not that long ago makes the horrors of the time more confronting. Everything is in German",
          "From the outside you could be forgiven for thinking this is a small museum. It isn't. It goes on and on, a testimony to the many innocent people imprisoned by the Stasi during the Cold War. Every now and then a display in one of the rooms will capture you and drag you in, so",

          "While we were visiting at the Brandenburg Gate one must definitely check out this museum. So much history and even brought up a few sad memories. Berlin today has most definitely changed. No matter what, be sure to check out the Nazi and Stasi Museum while in Berlin. It is",

          "The building itself has a long history but the story of the 20th century is fascinating. Personal stories from those persecuted during the Third Reich through to those persecuted by the Stasi. The entrance is very reasonable at 1:50 Euros and although the exhibits are not in",
          "An absolutely excellently preserved prison museum - 3 floors of cells each with its own story to tell. Unfortunately all exhibits are described in German only although I was given a brief guide book at the entrance in English but it was not well coordinated with the museum"

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Ruinenberg is a hill in the Bornstedt borough of Potsdam, located north of Sanssouci Park. In 1748, the Prussian king Frederick the Great had a water tank with a capacity of around 7,600 cubic metres (270,000 cu ft) built on top to supply the Sanssouci water features, and had it decorated with artificial ruins. From 1841 a surrounding landscape garden was laid out at the behest of King Frederick William IV of Prussia, according to plans designed by Peter Joseph Lenn\u00e9.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe lands around the former H\u00fcnenberg hill had been part of the partridge and pheasant hunting grounds of Frederick's father King Frederick William I of Prussia. His son Frederick the Great began the erection of Sanssouci Palace in 1745.\nFrederick wanted a lot of water for his then planned projects:  a fountain complex, the Neptune Grotto, and a marble colonnade in Sanssouci Park, which is no longer standing. The plans intended to draw water from the Havel with windmills into the high basin on the mountain. It then flowed under the park through a tubular system of hollowed tree trunks, which was to bring the water up into the fountains.\nThough the king poured a great deal of money into the project, it yielded no success because of the technical ignorance of his men. After many years of effort, Frederick\u2019s dream of fountains was finally given up in 1780.\nIn a letter to Voltaire, he wrote in 1778:\n\nI wanted to have a water jet in my garden: Euler calculated the force of the wheels necessary to raise the water to a reservoir, from where it should fall back through channels, finally spurting out in Sans Souci. My mill was carried out geometrically and could not raise a mouthful of water closer than fifty paces to the reservoir. Vanity of vanities! Vanity of geometry!\nMaster Builder Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff and Theater Painter Innocente Bellavite designed blinds of imitation antique ruins. A Monopteros (round temple), three high ionic columns, a small pyramid, and a ruined wall, designed as if from a Roman theatre, were grouped around the pool. \n\nAround a century after the construction of Sanssouci, Friedrich Wilhelm IV realized Frederick\u2019s dream. Through new technical possibilities of the steam engine and a modern piping system, the fountains were put into place. A building was erected especially for the steam engine (August Borsig) and its pump machine from 1841 to 1843 on the shore of the Havel.  Disguised as a mosque, it was designed by Ludwig Persius.\nPersius also had plans to extend the theater wall on the Ruinenberg with a 23 metres (75 ft) high look-out tower, in imitation of a medieval watchtower. After his early death, the so-called Norman Tower was built by Ferdinand von Arnim in 1846.\n\n\n== References ==\nThe information in this article is based on a translation of its German equivalent.\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Ruinenberg, the Nordic Garden and Sicilian Garden, and the Potentest\u00fcck\nThe Steam Engine Building\n(in German) The Norman Tower\nPotsdam from Above \u2013 Ruinenberg",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Thanks to the legend of The Miller of Sanssouci (German: Der M\u00fcller von Sanssouci), the Historic Mill (Historische M\u00fchle) became a famous well beyond the boundary of Potsdam in Germany and associated especially with Frederick the Great and his summer palace of Sanssouci.\n\n\n== History of the Mill ==\nIn 1736 the soldier king, Frederick William I of Prussia, gave permission  for the construction of a windmill, which was started in 1737. This first windmill, completed in 1738, was a post mill, whose entire superstructure, supported on a wooden post, was turned \"into the wind\" depending on the wind direction. The first mill and actual Historic Mill was thus older than the nearby summer palace, built in the years 1745 to 1747 for Frederick the Great.\nA half-century later the, by now dilapidated, post mill had to be demolished. The construction of a new mill, between 1787 and 1791, was financed by Frederick William II, because the mill had become famous far beyond the city of Potsdam as the result of a legend. The task was given to the master builder, Cornelius Wilhelm van der Bosch, who erected a bigger smock mill based on the Dutch prototype in place of the post mill.\nFollowing the accession of Frederick William IV in 1840, the landscape architect, Peter Joseph Lenn\u00e9, smartened up the area around the mill. In connexion with this, a triumphal way was planned by the king, in honour of Frederick the Great, but it was only partially realised. It was intended to incorporate the Historic Mill into this project as the road was to run from the Gate of Triumph, east of Sanssouci Park, and run past the newly built Orangery Palace to the Belvedere on the Klausberg. The March Revolution of 1848 and a lack of finance, however, meant that this grand project came to nothing.\nIn 1858 the last miller finished his tenancy. Because the king refused to allow other applicants to run the mill, the building became open to visitors in 1861.\nAt the end of the Second World War, on 27 April 1945, a Soviet tank was hit by a panzerfaust between the mill and the drive up to Sanssouci Palace. In the battle that followed the mill and the Swiss house at its foot were set ablaze. Both buildings were destroyed, the Swiss house (Schweizerhaus) was not rebuilt.\n\n\n== Reconstruction of the Historic Mill ==\n\nIn 1983 the Potsdam Chamber of Commerce began the restoration of the stone base. This work had to be stopped in 1990 due to financial difficulties. At the end of 1991, the rebuilding work was able to start again thanks to donations from the  state of Brandenburg, the North Rhine-Westphalia Foundation and the then Potsdam-Sanssouci Foundation of Prussian Palaces and Gardens.\nThe present smock mill is a replica of the one built from 1787 to 1791 and the third so-called Historic Mill. It had to be planned from photographs and measurements of the mill foundations, because the construction drawings by Cornelius Wilhelm van der Bosch were no longer available.\nThe mill is owned by the Berlin-Brandenburg Foundation for Prussian Palaces and Gardens (Stiftung Preu\u00dfische Schl\u00f6sser and G\u00e4rten Berlin-Brandenburg). It has been operated since 1995 by the Berlin-Brandenburg Mill Association, founded in 1990. \nSince 1984 a replica of the Historic Mill of Sanssouci in Potsdam has stood in the open land of the Gifhorn Mill Museum.\n\n\n== Technical data ==\n\nThe design reflects construction methods around the year 1800, its technical equipment in part that of the turn of the 19th century.\nMill design:\nOctagonal post, mill cap, mill technical features like the 5.5 metre long sail axle.\nThe mill has a height of 25.78 metres and, up to the upper edge of the sail, 35.45 metres.\nBreakdown:\n\nStone pedestal: 13.41 metres.\nWooden smock: 12.37 metres.\nLength of the rods (Segelgatterfl\u00fcgel): each 12 metres.\n\n\n== Legend ==\nThe legend of the Miller of Sanssouci first appeared in 1787 in a French book about the life of Frederick the Great (Vie de Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric II by an anonymous author) and in a watered-down form one year later in Germany.\nThe legend goes that Frederick the Great was being disturbed by the clatter of the mill sails and offered to buy the mill from its miller, Johann William Gr\u00e4venitz. When he refused, the king is supposed to have threatened: \"Does he not know that I can take the mill away from him by virtue of my royal power without paying one groschen for it?\" Whereupon the miller is supposed to have replied: \"Of course, your majesty, your majesty could easily do that, if \u2013 begging your pardon \u2013 it were not for the Supreme Court in Berlin.\"\n\nThis is only a legend. According to Frederick the Great the mill underscored the rural character of his summer palace and said \"that, ... the mill is an ornament for the palace.\" The miller was reportedly a difficult man, who cheated the local farmers over their flour and constantly pestered the king with petitions. At least one of these petitions was heard by Frederick II. Gr\u00e4venitz pointed to the fact that, as a result of the construction of the palace, the post mill no longer stood in the open, but was partly shielded from the wind. So he demanded that the king let him build the mill in another site and to pay him for it. Frederick II acceded to this, with the result that, shortly thereafter, the wily Gr\u00e4venitz was the proud possessor of two mills thanks to the king's grace, until he eventually resold the old mill.\n\nIn 1768 there was a legal dispute at another location over water rights and the remaining lease between Christian Arnold, the tenant of a mill in Pommerzig in the Neumark, and his landlord, the Count of Schmettau. After the miller was found guilty on two accounts, he appealed to Frederick the Great, who intervened in the ongoing proceedings in favour of the miller. Wrongly, as it turned out later. The king referred the case to the Berlin Court of Appeal, who once again ruled against the miller. Frederick the Great, then demanded a condemnation of the judges and their imprisonment in Spandau Citadel for their unjust judgments and thus precipitated an abuse of his name.\nThis legal battle and the story of the Sanssouci miller were woven together in the legend and were intended to emphasize the king's justice towards all his subjects. After the death of Frederick the Great, the case was reopened. His nephew and successor, Frederick William II decided in a compromise that \"... the Miller Arnold case ... should be viewed as the consequence of a mistake, whereby the praiseworthy judicial zeal of our royal uncle, who rests in God, was misled by incomplete, inadequate reporting of the true situation by badly informed and preoccupied [biased] people.\"\nIn the years that followed there continued to be disputes between the reigning kings and the millers for different reasons.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWindmill\n Gifhorn Mill Museum\nMiller Arnold Case\n\n\n== Literature ==\nAmtlicher F\u00fchrer der Stiftung Preu\u00dfische Schl\u00f6sser and G\u00e4rten Berlin Brandenburg: Die Historic Mill. 1.

          "We were surprised by the size of this museum. The whole prison has been converted to a museum. The exhibition explains in detail the history of the building and stories of the prisoners. It's a very powerful museum and memorial site. Ask for a booklet in English from the ticket",
          "I did not think I would be so interested in Potsdam! This was an excellent museum with some genuinely interesting and engaging exhibits. The museum was laid out chronologically and I particularly found the medieval aspects of the town to be of interest. The only small",
          "There is a lot of history here for only about 3 Euros. Prior reviews mention descriptions being in German only, but most of the exhibits had signs and descriptions in English below the ones in German, so they may have been recently added.There is also a special exhibit room",
          "I have been to Potsdam several times and have always missed going here. From the outside it looks like an ordinary villa, but behind is an entire prison. The thought that this was in use not that long ago makes the horrors of the time more confronting. Everything is in German",
          "From the outside you could be forgiven for thinking this is a small museum. It isn't. It goes on and on, a testimony to the many innocent people imprisoned by the Stasi during the Cold War. Every now and then a display in one of the rooms will capture you and drag you in, so",
          "This was an amazing experience, one I shall never forget. The tour guide was a brilliant Spanish lady who knew everything that had happened here. Everything had been well preserved. As a group we were introduced to an ex-inmate who gave this place a human touch as he discussed",
          "While we were visiting at the Brandenburg Gate one must definitely check out this museum. So much history and even brought up a few sad memories. Berlin today has most definitely changed. No matter what, be sure to check out the Nazi and Stasi Museum while in Berlin. It is",

          "Nice place for a walk, you can feel the history. Park and gardens are really large and well maintained.",
          "These gardens are very extensive. We found that on the outer edges locals were bike riding. Closer to the palaces visitors were strolling and enjoying the well kept gardens. Delightful.",
          "Lovely place to wander between the various buildings- a \u201cvisit all areas\u201d ticket is well worth the price, as you can visit anywhere that takes your fancy as you wander about.",
          "Place for the Potsdam Treaty that began the Cold War. Old palace and splendid gardens. Prepare to walk. Some ornate marquetry and other elaborate furnishings of the royals.",
          "With some time to spare in Potsdam, we took up the offer of touring around the formerly royal gardens, this time by a rather old fashioned double decker bus. We had walked around San Souci a few years before, and nearly suffered heat stroke as we did it, so this time it was",
          "The old windmill close by and then step into the well kept garden areas. Lots of green and very relaxing.",
          "The gardens and architecture of the palaces is truly beautiful. We didn't pay the fee to enter into any of the buildings, but the grounds are lovely. I would recommend a guided tour to learn more about the history. Fair warning: It is a TON of walking, not for the faint of",
          "We came in a very hot summers day wanted a trip out of Berlin for some fresh air and loved walking around the gardens. There is lots of variety, romantic areas, neoclassical areas, open areas and more mysterious woods. There is even a fantastic Chinese pavilion open to the",
          "As part of our Potsdam tour wee took a stroll through the park from the Spy Bridge to the Potsdam Treaty Palace. We were able to see beautiful mansions, nature and quite few locals sunbathing strip naked. It is interesting to observe how they relate theirselves with their bodies.",
          "We were a group of three friends and had a great time wandering amongst beautiful palaces and stunning gardens. We were lucky with the weather as it was not stifling heat but was nice enough to view different perspectives in pretty light. The cafe in the middle was sweet and I\u2019d",

HOWEVER there wasn\u2019t many places (other than one shop up near the windmill)",

          "I totally recommend a visit here as it\u2019s a lovely day out. I caught the train from Berlin (the train was very quick!) Potsdam makes a lovely change to the city of Berlin, lots of countryside so I got the best of both worlds whilst my visit to Germany :)",

          "The gardens at Potsdam are just beautiful and great for a long, lingering walk. All ages would enjoy it I feel and we saw loads of families enjoying the area on our visit. Plenty of leafy paths through the trees as well as the more manicured gardens and lawns. Sansoucci is a",

          "Taking into account this is a UNESCO Heritage city, we decided to join the private tour as the weather was cold and rainy. The tour guide did a great job to tell us as much stories as she could and showed us most of the function rooms of the New Palace and the Sanssouci Palace.",

          "After visiting the palace (see review), we only had time to walk in these splendid, amazing gardens. We were impressed by their design, by the king\u2019s grapevine, by the fountains and the tranquility of the place. Not to be missed!",
          "Potsdam is just an hour train from Berlin! I like this cities so much though I had just benn to palaces and the gardens! You should prepare sufficient time as the garden is large and it really takes half an hour for walking from garden to new palace (one way)!",
          "Make sure to spare atleast three hours for this spot. Also try to book in a tour early to avoid waiting as this is what happened in my experience. Remember to bring cold drinks and a bag for your rubbish as these are pretty much non existant in this park. Overall a good time",
          "We took the train from Alenderplatz in central Berlin and had a wonderful few hours walking through the gardens and visiting the palaces",
          "Must see. We fished our trip with having dinner at Kades Restaurant Am Pfingstberg and that was delighted.",
          "If in berlin and you have a day to spend take a train to Potsdam. Pack a picnic and take a stroll in the gardens",
          "I was really stunned by the city but -most importantly- by these gardens. Never in my life have I seen such a beautiful place!!",
          "This park (or series of parks) is huge! My time was limited (it was my last half day before leaving Berlin) so I didn't go inside any of the palaces, but still wanted to see them. Wandering all over this park for a few hours was the best way for me to do so. The areas range from",
          "The gardens by Sanssouci Palace, Neue Kammern, Orangerie, Roman Baths, and Charlottenhof Palace all enhanced the buildings they surrounded and varied from formal green gardens to informal beds with colorful annuals or lavender lined rose gardens. Special features in these",
          "My family and I took a day trip from Berlin via the S-Bahn and visited Potsdam and the Potsdam Gardens. We rented bikes from a shop near the S-Bahn station and road all through Potsdam and the gardens near the palaces. I definitely suggest a day trip to Potsdam, and if you want",
          "The whole network of parks and gardens - I mean the public parkland, not ones you pay to get into - make a wonderful day out of the city in sunny weather. Best ways to enjoy them is to hire a bike in Potsdam. Much too big to walk around more than a small part.",
          "Potsdam is a wonderful part of Berlin...absolutely packed with historic buildings, parks and museums. I'm so glad we decided to stop for a few days to explore the area. Will definitely be coming back but next time with the bikes.",
          "Impressive and nice to see the gardens. It was warm out so take sunscreen not much shade near the place. Stairs and walking required",
          "This is definitely worth a day visit, it is a beautiful walk around the gardens and the palaces are so grand. You can go into most the building at a price which I didn't do so can't comment on whether it is worth it. But you can definitely spend a whole day here by walking",
          "We spent the day walking from one garden to the next and viewing the different palaces outside only as there wasn't enough time to do it all. A great way to spend the day",
          "The formal gardens are large and well laid out on the old vineyard site below the palace building framed by the disciples of Bacchus and flanked by the grave of Friedrich the Great (big fan of the potato apparently).",
          "Very big park. You can easily walk for few hours in it. You'll also see the palace and other historical buildings",
          "Treasures everywhere as said for the Sancoucci gardens and a very variegated succession of constructions everywhere. Again, I give 3 because there's no signage and it is very hard to navigate.",
          "very understated gardens and wood lands, around the Palace , very well organized, with a spectacular view",
          "We had the best time not in the palaces or well designed gardens, but in the less visited spots in the tranquility of the more \"natural\" parks and the less visited monuments. We did not enter any palace that charged admission fee, just looked from the outside ( the orangery for",
          "Very much enjoyed the gardens but it is a very large estate requiring lots of walking. Wear comfortable shoes and take your time. Easy to wear yourself out quickly here. Very pretty.",
          "If you have a few hours left on a nice day a stroll in the gardens around Potsdam that are all world cultural heritage is a must. Most popular is the Park around Sanssouci castle but there are at least two more close by the old city that are equally beautiful: Neuer Garten and",

          "Beautiful gardens summer and autumn. A lot of walking but one of the most beautiful places in Germany.",
          "Not to be missed, so beautiful we could spent there the all day, very well decorated, specious and acceptable by public transport",
          "Beautiful English-style garden (Capability Brown could have been here) sprinkled with interesting buildings in addition to Sans Souci palace: the Neues Palais (New Palace), Old Fritz's picture gallery, the Orangerie, Charlottenhof palace, the Roman Baths and the Chinese",

          "Spent most of the day in and out of historical buildings, at the park and gardens. Just so much to cover in a day. The fountain and gardens were very well maintained and beautiful. Definitely a must see while in Potsdam.",
          "Spent a full day in Potsdam which is the minimum to do it justice, so much to see, will be going back for a long weekend. Sans souci Palace is the highlight.",
          "Potsdam big draw are its vast parks and gardens and the palaces. The biggest of which is the Sanssouci Park. It is pretty huge but there are ample bike paths that allow you to cycle through its vast grounds to the various attractions within. If I had to walk through the park, I",
          "Very calming area, beautiful gardens with the yellow palace in the background. Would highly recommend for anyone who wants to get away from the city and enjoys nature, you could spend hours here and not realise!",
          "These gardens are huge, with lots of cycle paths to and around them, so best hire a bike. You can get the bikes right at the train station. Unfortunately you can't ride right up to some of the amazing buildings, but there are racks at points to lock your bikes up to while you",
          "Nice place to visit with easy approach. Good Shopping Area. Always move in group for fun and enjoyment",
          "Potsdam is 40min from Berlin and is a must visit when in Berlin. The gardens are huge and amazing. Totally recommended.",
          "We walked through the park in the early morning. It was beautifully quiet. Only a few joggers and us.",
          "These are easily reached to/from Sansoucci Park. Both of which are lovely to walk around and explore. So many pretty gardens, structures, and just quiet... peace.",
          "The Potsdam gardens are the setting for many of the other attractions of historic Potsdam. Entry is free and it would take a good 3-4 energetic hours to traverse its main pedestrian axis pathways and its many meandering byways. Mature European trees, large lush green lawn",
          "Get a bike and cycle around. Although you need to get off the bike to walk through certain parts of the garden it's the best way to get around and appreciate the environs.",
          "Perfect for a romatic walk as well as to spend a whole afternoon with your family there. I was there on a Saturday afternoon in July and was not overcrowded. Walking around the big trees, old buildings, by the lake I felt like being in a fairy tale :) Really enjoyed it.",
          "After almost a week of going to museums and shopping in Berlin, I was ready for some fresh air. The palaces are spectacular, but their gardens and wooded areas provide the perfect setting for showing off that architecture. Check out the green houses and nursery to see where",

          "A quick trip from Berlin using S7 brings you here. The garden is really big (and free) and there are a lot of palaces to check out. If I were you I would do them on my own. There are \"tour\" buses and hop on hop off but you can never check a place better then when you do it by",
          "Fredrick the Great definitely knew how to live. His palace is amazing and the grounds are just awesome. It is very well kept and just taking a stroll through here was impressive. The name is very fitting as just going through the park gave you a sense of 'Sans Souci' or",
          "We purchased a train ticket for zones A B and C, and took the underground from the station outside our hotel--the Berlin Hilton--to the main station, then transferred to the train for Potsdam. We decided to take the bus tour to the gardens instead of just visiting the pretty",
          "Beautiful gardens set in Potsdam - well worth a visit and easily accessible by train from Berlin. Potsdam is a lovely place to visit and access to these gardens is free but you may need to catch a bus from Potsdam as its a little way out of the centre.",
          "A little way out from Berlin but reachable on the S-Bahn. A beautiful place and the gardens are fabulous as well as the house. Also worth a visit is the windmill",
          "Frederick the Great built an amazing complex of gardens, palaces, and support buildings in Potsdam, which he preferred to Berlin proper. The cost to maintain these facilities is plainly more than the authorities can muster. Do take a walk through the gardens, but spare",
          "We took a half-day tour out to Potsdam. Don't do that. Take the train out there on your own and enjoy the gardens and scenery. Pull up the wikipedia page on Frederick the Great before you go and you'll be in the know.",
          "These gardens are beautiful. The walking paths through them are so peaceful you easily lose track of time.",
          "The gardens are quite extensive and impressive, but while you can visit the gardens for free, they are a bit of a trek on foot from the railway station, and you really ought to make a day trip out of your visit by paying to visit the palaces and other associated buildings as",
          "These gardens are in Potsdam and they are very big. We went when it had snowed but I can image it being a nice place to go in the Summer.",
          "Be ready to walk a lot. There is so much to see! We didn't see all the lovely gardens, water features and statutes because we wore out. It is an incredible place. I would take a picnic next time and sit for awhile just enjoying the view.",
          "To be absolutely seen! the gardens access is free, and definitely the most enjoyable part of the palace. You can still visit the sanssouci palace, but it is very small and uninpressive, the new palace is much more interesting, but the key rooms are currently being refurbished,",
          "Fabulous little place with a Dutch feel to it in terms of the architecture though it is of course Prussian. Very relaxed atmosphere with nice shops and places to eat and drink.",
          "There are three palaces here, probably the most famous and best being the Rococco Sanssouci. Don't miss the art gallery next door in a totally separate building. The gardens are excellent. For me the best of all was the Italian style Orangery, a short walk from the palace. There",
          "The most beautiful collection of buildings in wonderful parkland. Excellent audio guides and good value admission gets you into all the museums and galleries in the area. Close to old Potsdam, too which is worth a visit on its own. Fills a whole day and more",
          "We spend couple hours in the afternoon. It is very scenic and good . Also Postdam area itseld if very beautiful.",
          "Got the train to Potsdam, hired a bike and spent the day here, the gardens were a highlight. A nice change to the hustle and bustle of Berlin itself.",
          "Lovely gardens and very historic. While it takes a little while to get there from Berlin, it is worth planning to spend a day there. You should include a look inside the historic windmill, within the Sans Souci grounds.",
          "These gardens are a delightful place to spend the day. The entry is free and there is a good mix of formal and informal spaces. Tip - take a bus or tram from the station as it is a long walk!",
          "Beautiful area, with lovely gardens we made it a day trip and wandered around the grounds and palace of Sanssouci going down the staircase with the vines growing in their individual greenhouses, everything was clean and tidy, with other palaces in the area to visit.",
          "Anyone with an interest in nature and/or European history must visit the gardens at Potsdam. It is only a half hour S Bahn ride from Berlin. It is a wonderful creation by Frederick the Great. We walked the 2.5 km from west to east and visited Sans Souci as well as the New",
          "In the former East Germany but very accessible by Public Transport Metro & Buses. Very interesting in a Hostrical way.",
          "Beautiful. easy train ride from Berlin. Terrific walk as long as it's not too hot out. The grounds are magnificent and well worth seeing.",
          "had a full day here. Caught the S7 and then the 695 bus. Excellent day lots to see and wonderful gardens to stroll around",
          "Stunning place. Absolutely huge so be prepared for walking..a lot! So many palaces and they arr huge with masses of statues and details. Sans-Souci Palace gorgeous and the steps and wonderful planting against the brick wall, and green glass doors highly unusual, very different",
          "Absolutely beautiful. I also recommend visiting the Old Market. We will definitely revisit Potsdam again.",

          "Wonderful day trained from Berlin and bus 695 in Potsdam to the Sanssouci palace and the grounds. Tickets at tourist information center at Potsdam train station. Tickets and time scheduled for a 45-minute audio tour of palace interior. We avoided ticket hustlers at train station",
          "From Berlin HBF took the S-bahn to Potsdam, the whole journey took 35 minutes. Then took a bus outside the train station to Schloss Sans Souci (at the interval of 15 minutes). We visited both the Orangerie Schloss and the Schloss Sans Souci (which are located in the same",

          "During a stay in Berlin a sunny day tempted us out of the city to Potsdam. A journey on the S-bahn and a chance to see the coutryside around Berlin was a treat in itself. Once in Potsdam there is a regular bus to the Sans Soussi palace and gardens which offers a glimpse into",
          "Beautiful even in the rain. It IS very large though. Bikes would have been a better idea than walking",
          "A visit to Potsdam is more than worth while. Take train from Berlin Hauptbahnhof and within 35 min you arrive at Potsdam Bahnhof. There you can take bus 606 to get to Neues Palais in 10 to 15 minutes. You can buy your combi ticket at the entrance and enjoy then the authentic",
          "A nice place to get away from the busy city - take a romantic stroll and enjoy the parks. Nice both summer and winter.",
          "Sprawling gardens with fantastic palaces and roman baths. We were confused at first about what a Monday visit means .... the gardens / restaurant are open, and if you want to see the outsides of the palaces, that makes sense. Some of the sights said it was \"closed\" on Mondays",
          "We had a thoroughly pleasant afternoon walking around the well laid out formal gardens of the Sans Souci palace of Frederick the Great. It's flat and level, cool trees and some splendid buildings in the grounds. Well worth a trip to Potsdam",
          "Well worth the 30 minute train ride from Berlin. This palace is amazing and if you are a photographer like me will be in heaven! Only do this if it is a nice day as the walking is endless but worth it.",
          "Just a beautiful place and beautiful landscaped gardens . It was raining lightly but this did not in any way fault with pleasure . It is not recommended to visit the palace itself and can certainly be satisfied with a tour of the gardens only.",
          "We bought a Pass to allow us into all the museums etc in the gardens. We did it as a day trip from Berlin using public transport. Buy a ticket for the day and you can use it on trains and buses in Berlin and Potsdam. Give yourself lots of time to enjoy all the sights and the",

          "Oh my goodness by far and away the no.1 attraction for us in Berlin was Potsdam what a wonderful gem of a place to visit. We booked in advance of the trip and the day we went we were very lucky, blue skies and sunshine. The most beautiful expanse of gardens can be found here,",
          "If you like walking in beautiful surroundings this is the place to go. It is near berlin if you want to get away from the city. The gardens are well kept and quite big. It\u2019s like walking into a different era...",
          "So beautiful its hard to describe. The grounds are kept in perfect condition. People that work there are so nice and helpful. I can just imagine royalties walking around. It is peaceful and relaxing. There is a lot to cover by foot, so bring your walking shoes. Also remember",
          "Beautiful place to visit, totally recommended! There is a bus (hop on hop off) really convinience if you have only one day to spend there. There are some boats tour that you will enjoy also. Important to be on mind the squedule of the busses and boat",
          "....they seem to be very anal about wheeling a bike around so that may be a limitation for you - need to find somewhere 'legal' to park your bike.",
          "One of my favourite places to see in Berlin. I couldn't have been happier to visit Potsdam and all of the symmetrical architecture is surely a sight to behold. I would happily spend everyday at these garden appreciating the view and the palace.",
          "One of the largest Royal \"city\" gardens. Mostly trees, some ponds and flower beds. Many paths, almost all with pebbles, so comfortable shoes are a must. Beautiful Sanssouci Palace (tours for inside viewing are also in English) with its terrasses planted with grapevines and fig",
          "Rather than take a tour, we took the train from Berlin and a bus to the main palaces then just wandered between locations. You need an entire day and we wished we had arrived earlier so we had a little time after to visit the city proper, too. Our extensive walking tour might",
          "More than amazing place to visit, a huge area of garden with more than perfect palaces. In this visit you are going to enjoy the beautiful views and interesting architectures. Note: If you are planning to have this visit on your foot (no tour bus) then you have to prepare a",
          "This requires, without entering any of museums inside, whole day. It's quite well accessible from main train station in Potsdam even by foot, but considering amount of walking you are going to make it's better to use public transport to there. Was there twice visiting only",
          "Enjoyable visit outside of Berlin. Very pretty, upscale area. Historically where Stalin, Churchill and Truman divided up the world.",
          "Well worth seeing. Very large gardens so you should be prepared for a lot of walking. The sheer scale and wealth behind this is amazing. Good restaurant near the \"New\" Palace. It's worth exploring Potsdam itself, especially the Dutch quarter.",
          "For me, this is not one of those places that you have on a checklist with 10 other items to visit that day. If you visit it on a hurry you probably will not like it that much. This is a place where you need to go but with plenty of time, the gardens are the attraction, but take",
          "Unlike Berlin which was nearly grazed to the ground in WW2 and rebuilt in a bewildering mish-mash of semi-modern, soviet and true-to-original styles, this town kept its original charm and is a BEAUTIFUL haven for lovers of the glory of past eras. Lush gardens, luxurious",

          "The Sanssouci gardens are charming and a welcome change from the city streets of Berlin. The park itself is open from dawn to dusk and is free. The terraced vineyards in front of the Palace of Sanssouci are magnificent. There is a vast area of parkland to wander in, perfect",
          "The Gardens are very well maintained and the building itself is being renovated. The tour inside brings much of history into perspective. Well worth the visit.",
          "By far one of the most beautiful gardens I have ever had the pleasure of being in. Lush, vibrant and scenic are but a few words to describe this amazing place",

          "Had a very pleasant time spent with family. The gardens are extensive and beautifully kept, so much to see, you could spend all day here. Make sure that you have comfortable shoes, you will be walking a lot !! The Sanssouci Palace is well worth a visit, very impressive, but get",

          "This was the most beautiful thing in the world. The gardens in Potzdam are amazing and the Summer castles are incredible. Every corner you turn brings you into a different world and a new experience. It was extremely hot the day we went to Potzdam and it was pretty tiring so",
          "Short train ride and then bus to Sans souci allows one to wander freely in the lovely landscaped palace of the former rulers. Various palaces and follies dot the area and fountains and statues compete for fotos. Worth a visit.",

          "wow! you just have to go to this venue ..beautiful, relaxing and historic palaces are out of this world",

          "I had high expectation on my one day trip to Potsdam, but I was a bit disappointed. i joined a local tour. The garden was just average. The palace is also average. It was a very hot day walking under the sun for six hours with only 30 minutes lunch break. I was very tired after",
          "The parks themselves are not well kept. But they are very large and getting to the main attraction, the Schloss Sanssouci, took an hour from the entrance (we don't walk quickly but it is 2km from the entrance nearest to the closest rail station, itself 1km from the entrance).",
          "Potsdam is a wonderful place for a day excursion, easily reached by public transportation. The various gardens there are beautiful and even spectacular at times, and they are in various styles. The palaces there are absolutely worth visiting, so while you will want to linger in",

          "Spectacular gardens and wonderful architecture. Be prepared to spend all day there as it is a vast complex with much to see and lots of walking to do. You will need to go to the ticket office for a Palace visit and be allocated a visiting time. If it is very busy the time",

          "This beautiful baroque park connects several 18th century palaces built by German emperors in Potsdam, including Sanssouci and the Neues Palais (New Palace). The visitor encounters small plazas with statues and fountains along the way, and while the main promenade (Hauptallee)",

          "San, souci is a beautiful place nice day trip from Berlin. Potsdam is full of great history. We could not see much as it was a rainy day but what we could see was beautiful. I would highly recommend visiting and having a picnic in one of these magnificent gardens. This town",
          "After making our way to Potsdam by train, we were met by lightning and thunder couple with heavy downpour. It was more like monsoon. The little shop inside the station was doing a roaring trade in umbrellas without ripping off the tourists and we bought one too. After analysing",

          "The Surface Rail is easy to Pottsdam, take the bus or tram to the palace but if it is a pretty day get off at the old pedestrian street/visitors center (do not go in! no bathrooms and they charge for free maps that are no help what so ever!) They did direct us through the gate",

          "Potsdam has an intriging history but I found the most recent the most fasinating. Only 10 years ago Germans ,and the rest of us, have been allowed back into the wealthy streets surrounding the gardens. These were the homes and offices of the KGB after WW11 and over recent years",

          "We took a train to Potsdam for a day. It was mid April and there were only spring bulbs, leaves just budding on trees, and all signs of a garden that will be spectacular in another month. Even without having reached it's full yearly potential I would consider the gardens as well",
          "I visited the Potsdam Gardens back in July 2011 on a lovely, bright forenoon. I really enjoyed the stroll through the park, the architecture was amazing, specifically the Sans Scouscci Palace, and the Chinese Doll house. Its a pluss there is no entrance fee. It is huge so if you",

          "The New Palace in Potsdams gardens is a good 2 miles walk from the S bahn station in Potsdam. March is probably not the besttime to experience the flowers and foliage but even on a bright sunny day one can experience the magnificence of this park",
          "Loved the castles, especially when covered in winter were lovely. Did not go in however, as we needed to buy a ticket and we were more keen to wander the outsides. Definitely had a great time here and took lots of amazing pictures!",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Cecilienhof Palace (German: Schloss Cecilienhof) is a palace in Potsdam, Brandenburg, Germany built from 1914 to 1917 in the layout of an English Tudor manor house. Cecilienhof was the last palace built by the House of Hohenzollern that ruled the Kingdom of Prussia and the German Empire until the end of World War I. It is famous for having been the location of the Potsdam Conference in 1945, in which the leaders of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States made important decisions affecting the shape of post World War II Europe and Asia. Cecilienhof has been part of the Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1990.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nCecilienhof is located in the northern part of the large Neuer Garten park, close to the shore of the Jungfernsee lake. The park was laid out from 1787 at the behest of King Frederick William II of Prussia, modelled on the W\u00f6rlitz Park in Anhalt-Dessau. Frederick William II also had the Marmorpalais (Marble Palace) built within the Neuer Garten, the first Brandenburg palace in the Neoclassical style erected according to plans designed by Carl von Gontard and Carl Gotthard Langhans, which was finished in 1793. Other structures within the park close to Schloss Cecilienhof include an orangery, an artificial grotto (Muschelgrotte), the \"Gothic Library\", and the Dairy in the New Garden, also constructed for King Frederick William II.\nThe park was largely redesigned as an English landscape garden according to plans by Peter Joseph Lenn\u00e9 from 1816 onwards, with lines of sight to nearby Pfaueninsel, Glienicke Palace, Babelsberg Palace, and the Sacrow Church.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nSince the Marmorpalais, which had been the traditional Potsdam residence of the Hohenzollern crown prince, had become inadequate for current tastes, Emperor Wilhelm II ordered the establishment of a fund for constructing a new palace at Potsdam for his oldest son, Crown Prince Wilhelm (William) and his wife, Duchess Cecilie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin on 19 December 1912. After their marriage in 1905, Wilhelm and Cecilie had previously lived at the Marmorpalais for most of the year and at the Berlin Kronprinzenpalais in winter. In 1911, the Crown Prince had been appointed commander of the Prussian 1. Leibhusaren-Regiment and moved to Danzig-Langfuhr.\nOn 13 April 1914 the Imperial Ministry and the Saalecker Werkst\u00e4tten signed a building contract that envisaged a completion date of 1 October 1915 and a construction cost of 1,498,000 Reichsmark for the new palace. The architect was Paul Schultze-Naumburg, who visited the couple in Danzig to work out the design for the palace. It was based on English Tudor style buildings, arranged around several courtyards featuring half-timbered walls, bricks and 55 different decorative chimney stacks. With the start of World War I in August 1914, construction stopped but was resumed in 1915.\n\n\n== Architecture and interior design ==\nCrown Prince Wilhelm was so impressed with cottage and tudor style homes like Bidston Court in Birkenhead (England) that Cecilienhof was inspired by it. Also, due to Duchess Cecilie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin's family ties, German tudor-styled Gelbensande Manor near Rostock in Mecklenburg-Schwerin was an inspiration. The palace was designed in such a way as to be inhabitable for most of the year. Its low structure and multiple courts conceal the fact that it boasts a total of 176 rooms. Besides the large Ehrenhof (three-sided courtyard) in the centre, which was used only for the arrival and departure of the Crown Prince and his wife, there is a smaller garden court, the Prinzengarten, and three other courts around which the various wings of the building are arranged.The \"public\" rooms were located in the centre part on the ground floor, around a central great hall, while above on the first floor were the \"private\" bedroom, dressing rooms and bathrooms. The living area of the great hall also features a massive wooden stairway made of oak. This was a gift from the city of Danzig. The ground floor rooms included an area for the Crown Prince with smoking room, library and breakfast room as well as an area for his wife with music salon, writing room and a room designed like a cabin on an ocean liner. The latter was used by Cecilie as a breakfast room. Like some of the other rooms it was designed by Paul Ludwig Troost, who also designed actual interiors of ocean liners for the Norddeutscher Lloyd shipping line.\n\n\n== History before 1945 ==\nThe palace was finished in August 1917. It was named Cecilienhof after the Duchess and the couple moved in immediately. Cecilie gave birth at Cecilienhof to her youngest child, Cecilie of Prussia who was born on 5 September 1917. However, when the revolution erupted in November 1918, for security reasons Cecilie and her six children moved for a while to the Neues Palais, where the wife of Emperor Wilhelm II, Empress Augusta Victoria, was living. After the Empress followed her husband into exile in the Netherlands, Cecilie remained in Potsdam and returned to Cecilienhof where she lived until 1920. As the property of the Hohenzollern family had been confiscated after the revolution, Cecilie then had to move her residence to an estate at Oels in Silesia, which was a private property. Only her sons Wilhelm (William) and Louis Ferdinand remained at Cecilienhof while they attended a public Realgymnasium (school) in Potsdam. Crown Prince Wilhelm had gone into exile in the Netherlands on 13 November 1918 and was interned on the island of Wieringen. He was allowed to return to Germany\u2014as a private citizen\u2014on 9 November 1923. In June 1926, a referendum on expropriating the former ruling Princes of Germany without compensation failed and as a consequence, the financial situation of the Hohenzollern family improved considerably. A settlement between the state and the family made Cecilienhof property of the state but granted a right of residence to Wilhelm and Cecilie. This was limited in duration to three generations.Wilhelm subsequently broke the promise he had made to Gustav Stresemann, who allowed him to return to Germany, to stay out of politics. He supported the rise to power of Adolf Hitler, who visited Cecilienhof three times, in 1926, in 1933 (on the \"Day of Potsdam\") and in 1935. However, when Wilhelm realized that Hitler had no intention of restoring the monarchy, their relationship cooled. After the assassination attempt on 20 July 1944, Hitler had Wilhelm placed under supervision by the Gestapo and had Cecilienhof watched.In January 1945, Wilhelm left Potsdam for Oberstdorf for a treatment of his gall and liver problems. Cecilie fled in early February 1945 as the Red Army drew closer to Berlin, without being able to salvage much in terms of her possessions. At the end of the war, Cecilienhof was seized by the Soviets.\n\n\n== Potsdam Conference of 1945 ==\n\nThe Potsdam Conference (officially the \"Berlin Conference\") took place from 17 July to 2 August 1945. It was the third and longest summit between the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States, the major forces in the anti-Hitler-coalition that had just won the war after VE day, 8 May 1945. The conference was mainly organized by the Soviets. Although the British prime minister Winston Churchill had refused to hold a summit \"anywhere within the current Soviet military zone\", US President Harry Truman and Soviet leader Josef Stalin had agreed in late May 1945 to meet \"near Berlin\". As Berlin itself had been too heavily damaged by Allied bombing and street-to-street fighting, Cecilienhof in Potsdam was selected as the location for the conference. The delegations were to be housed in the leafy suburb of Potsdam-Babelsberg, which had suffered only slight damage in the bombing raids and also offered the advantage that the streets to the conference venue were easy to guard.Soviet soldiers repaired the streets connecting Babelsberg to Cecilienhof, built a pontoon bridge to replace the Glienicker Br\u00fccke, which had been destroyed during the last days of the war, planted trees, bushes and flower beds\u2014including the Soviet red star in the Ehrenhof of the palace. At Cecilienhof, 36 rooms and the great hall were renovated and furnished with furniture from other Potsdam palaces. The furniture of Wilhelm and Cecilie had been removed by the Soviets and stored at the Dairy.\nThe main rooms used for the conference were as follows:\n\nCecilie's music salon\u2014White Salon, used by the Soviet delegation as a reception room (on the first day of the conference, this was also the site of a buffet Stalin provided to the other delegations),\nCecilie's writing room\u2014Red Salon, used by the Soviet delegation as a study,\nGreat hall\u2014this was the conference hall, fitted by the Soviets with a round table of 10 feet diameter (probably custom-made by a Moscow-based furniture company),\nWilhelm's smoking room\u2014study of the American delegation,\nWilhelm's library\u2014study of the British delegation,\nWilhelm's breakfast room\u2014possibly used as a secretary's office.However, according to the official guide to the palace, evidence has recently emerged that indicates that the current designation of the British and American studies may have been switched by the Soviets after the conference.\n\n\n== Post World War II and today ==\nAfter the conference ended, Soviet troops used the palace as a clubhouse. It was handed over to the state of Brandenburg and in 1952 a memorial for the Conference was set up in the former private chambers of Wilhelm and Cecilie. The government of Eastern Germany also used the palace as a reception venue for state visits. The rest of the complex became a hotel in 1960. Some of the rooms were used by the ruling party (SED) for meetings.However, after 1961, a part of the Neuer Garten was destroyed to build the southwest section of the Berlin Wall (as part of the Grenzsicherungsanlagen) which ran along the shore of Jungfernsee. Beginning in 1985, the VEB Reiseb\u00fcro (state-owned travel agency) modernised the hotel.Today, parts of Cecilienhof are still used as a museum and as a hotel. In 1990 it became part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site called Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin. The private rooms were opened to the public in 1995 after comprehensive restoration work. Queen Elizabeth II visited Cecilienhof on 3 November 2004. On 30 May 2007, the palace was used for a summit by the G8 foreign ministers. In 2011, Schloss Cecilienhof was awarded the European Heritage Label. The redesigned permanent exhibition on the Potsdam Conference was reopened in April 2012.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCecilienhof Palace - Official site",

          "Was here with a tour group. The gardens are superb! Building is pushing 100 years old and some parts of it look it. The audio guide was very informative. Lots of history to take in. Research the Conference before you go and you'll get a lot more out of it. The only ripoff",

          "Cecilienhof is a picturesque, typically German-looking house, except larger. There's a sculpted flowerbed inside, which is good for a photo or two. The audio tour itself was OK, nothing to write home about, you would have to be interested in the history of the Potsdam Conference",
          "This is a small place. You have to pay to get in and you get a taped tour. You won't have to pay to see the grounds. If you are interested in history of it, it is worthwhile , otherwise , it is no all that glamorous as sansouci.",

          "We visited this site as part of a Viking River cruise and sadly only browsed around outside. I would imagine it was fascinating if we could have gone inside as this is the site of the Potsdam Conference, in which Stalin, Churchill, and Truman met to decide the fate of Europe",
          "Having read other reviews about Cecilienhof we almost didn't go, but what a mistake that would have been. We sooooo enjoyed it. I am no historian but it was really interesting to see the room - and the very table at which Churchill, Truman and Stalin sat to divide up the spoils",

          "I wanted to visit the Cecilienhof Palace rather than the other Potsdam Palaces due to the part it played in hosting the Potsdam Conference and I wasn't disappointed. First we walked from the Potsdam Railway Station which takes about 40 mins-1 hour, to allow us to experience",

          "This is where Stalin, Truman, Churchill, and later Attlee met to write the Potsdam Agreement. You can take a tour through the rooms and see where history was made. The first time I was here, the Berlin Wall separated it from the lake, but now it is much nicer. The building",

          "The place is highly recommended. It is a piece of living history where you get to see the actual location where one of the most important conferences, with Churchill, Stalin, Truman and De Gaul took place. Also, you get to see the different quarters for the different Allies. A",
          "The Cecilienhof in the New Garden seemed more like a modern manor house than a royal palace. Indeed it was built during the Great War for the Crown Prince and Princess, and the whole place shows her touch. Not only was the Conference Room where the Potsdam Conference was held",
          "A beautiful setting within a large garden and forest on the lake. The location of the meeting of Truman, Stalin, Churchill and Attlee (Churchill's successor) to decide the fate of Germany post-WW2. The castle is also used as a hotel, and is a nice part of a day exploring around",

          "The house and grounds of Cecilienhof have a very interesting history which are well-captured in the exhibits and audioguides available for the tour. The audioguide, in particular, does a good job outlining the pre-war history of the house and the events after the end of WWII",
          "It looks more like a house in countryside of Germany. Didnt have a chance to get into the palace because it is closed on every Monday. Still we got a chance to look, around the back part which included the beautiful garden fulled of roses and many more.",
          "Cecilienhof is a building with great historical importance. In the summer the gardens are absolutely stunning. The huge red soviet star, planted on the orders of Stalin displays both the beauty and the importance of this building. I haven't seen inside the building, which now",

        "wiki": "Potsdam (German pronunciation: [\u02c8p\u0254t\u0361sdam] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of the German federal state of Brandenburg. It directly borders the German capital, Berlin, and is part of the Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region. It is situated on the River Havel some 25 kilometres (16 miles) southwest of Berlin's city centre.\nPotsdam was a residence of the Prussian kings and the German Kaiser until 1918. Its planning embodied ideas of the Age of Enlightenment: through a careful balance of architecture and landscape, Potsdam was intended as \"a picturesque, pastoral dream\" which would remind its residents of their relationship with nature and reason.The city lies in an area of interconnected lakes and is distinguished by a series of cultural landmarks, in particular the parks and palaces of Sanssouci, the largest World Heritage Site in Germany. The Potsdam Conference in 1945 was held at Cecilienhof Palace.\nBabelsberg, in the south-eastern part of Potsdam, was already by the 1930s the home of a major film production studio and it has enjoyed success as an important center of European film production since the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Filmstudio Babelsberg is the oldest large-scale film studio in the world.Potsdam developed into a centre of science in Germany in the 19th century. Today, there are three public colleges, the University of Potsdam, and more than 30 research institutes in the city.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe area was formed from a series of large moraines left after the last glacial period. Today, only one quarter of the city is built up, the rest remaining as green space.\nThere are about 20 lakes and rivers in and around Potsdam, such as the Havel, the Griebnitzsee, Templiner See, Tiefer See, Jungfernsee, Teltowkanal, Heiliger See, and Sacrower See. The highest point is the 114-metre (374 ft) high Kleiner Ravensberg.\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\nPotsdam is divided into seven historic city Bezirke and nine new Stadtteile (villages), which joined the city in 2003. The appearance of the city quarters is quite different. Those in the north and in the centre consist mainly of historical buildings, the south of the city is dominated by larger areas of newer buildings.\nThe city of Potsdam is divided into 34 Stadtteile (or quarters), which are divided further into 84 statistical Bezirke.\nToday one distinguishes between the older parts of the city (areas of the historic city and places suburbanized at the latest in 1939) - these are the city center, the western and northern suburbs, Bornim, Bornstedt, Nedlitz, Potsdam South, Babelsberg, Drewitz, Stern and Kirchsteigfeld - and those communities incorporated after 1990 which have since 2003 become Stadtteile - these are Eiche, Fahrland, Golm, Gro\u00df Glienicke, Grube, Marquardt, Neu Fahrland, Satzkorn and Uetz-Paaren. The new Stadtteile are located mainly in the north of the city. For the history of all incorporations, see the relevant section on incorporation and spin-offs.\nStructure with statistical numbering:\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nOfficially the climate is oceanic - more degraded by being far from the coast and to the east (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), but using the 1961-1990 normal and the 0 \u00b0C isotherm the city has a humid continental climate (Dfb), which also shows a slight influence of the continent different from the climates predominantly influenced by the Atlantic Ocean. Low averages below freezing for almost all winter causing snows that are frequent and winters are cold, but not as stringent as inland locations or with greater influence from the same. Summer is also relatively warm with temperatures between 23 and 24 \u00b0C, the heat waves being influenced by the UHI of Potsdam.The average winter high temperature is 3.5 \u00b0C (38.3 \u00b0F), with a low of \u22121.7 \u00b0C (28.9 \u00b0F). Snow is common in the winter. Spring and autumn are short. Summers are mild, with a high of 23.6 \u00b0C (74.5 \u00b0F) and a low of 12.7 \u00b0C (54.9 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Potsdam\" originally seems to have been Poztupimi. A common theory is that it derives from an old West Slavonic term meaning \"beneath the oaks\", i.e., the corrupted pod dubmi/dubimi (pod \"beneath\", dub \"oak\"). However some question this explanation.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre- and early history ===\n\nThe area around Potsdam shows signs of occupancy since the Bronze Age and was part of Magna Germania as described by Tacitus. After the great migrations of the Germanic peoples, Slavs moved in and Potsdam was probably founded after the 7th century as a settlement of the Hevelli tribe centred on a castle. It was first mentioned in a document in 993 as Poztupimi, when Emperor Otto III gifted the territory to the Quedlinburg Abbey, then led by his aunt Matilda. By 1317, it was mentioned as a small town. It gained its town charter in 1345. In 1573, it was still a small market town of 2,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n=== Early modern era ===\nPotsdam lost nearly half of its population due to the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648).\nA continuous Hohenzollern possession since 1415, Potsdam became prominent, when it was chosen in 1660 as the hunting residence of Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg, the core of the powerful state that later became the Kingdom of Prussia. It also housed Prussian barracks.\n\nAfter the Edict of Potsdam in 1685, Potsdam became a centre of European immigration. Its religious freedom attracted people from France (Huguenots), Russia, the Netherlands and Bohemia. The edict accelerated population growth and economic recovery.\nLater, the city became a full residence of the Prussian royal family. The buildings of the royal residences were built mainly during the reign of Frederick the Great. One of these is the Sanssouci Palace (French: \"without cares\", by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff, 1744), famed for its formal gardens and Rococo interiors. Other royal residences include the New Palace and the Orangery.\nIn 1815, at the formation of the Province of Brandenburg, Potsdam became the provincial capital until 1918, except for a period between 1827 and 1843 when Berlin was the provincial capital (as it became once again after 1918). The province comprised two governorates named after their capitals Potsdam and Frankfurt (Oder).\n\n\n=== Governorate of Potsdam ===\n\nBetween 1815 and 1945, the city of Potsdam served as capital of the governorate of Potsdam (German: Regierungsbezirk Potsdam). The Regierungsbezirk encompassed the former districts of Uckermark, the Mark of Priegnitz, and the greater part of the Middle March. It was situated between Mecklenburg and the Province of Pomerania on the north, and the Province of Saxony on the south and west (Berlin, with a small surrounding district, was an urban governorate and enclave within the governorate of Potsdam between 1815 and 1822, then it merged as urban district into the governorate only to be disentangled again from Potsdam governorate in 1875, becoming a distinct province-like entity on 1 April 1881). Towards the north west the governorate was bounded by the rivers Elbe and the Havel, and on the north east by the Oder. The south eastern boundary was to the neighbouring governorate of Frankfurt (Oder). About 500,000 inhabitants lived in the Potsdam governorate, which covered an area of about 20,700 square kilometres (7,992 sq mi), divided into thirteen rural districts, partially named after their capitals:\nThe traditional towns in the governorate were small, however, in the course of the industrial labour migration some reached the rank of urban districts. The principal towns were Brandenburg upon Havel, K\u00f6penick, Potsdam, Prenzlau, Spandau and Ruppin. Until 1875 Berlin also was a town within the governorate. After its disentanglement a number of its suburbs outside Berlin's municipal borders grew to towns, many forming urban Bezirke within the governorate of Potsdam such as Charlottenburg, Lichtenberg, Rixdorf (after 1912 Neuk\u00f6lln), and Sch\u00f6neberg (all of which, as well as K\u00f6penick and Spandau, incorporated into Greater Berlin in 1920). The urban Bezirke were (years indicating the elevation to rank of urban Bezirkor affiliation with Potsdam governorate, respectively):\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nBerlin was the capital of Prussia and later of the German Empire, but the court remained in Potsdam, where many government officials settled. In 1914, Emperor Wilhelm II signed the Declaration of War in the Neues Palais (New Palace). The city lost its status as a \"second capital\" in 1918, when Wilhelm II abdicated and Germany became a Republic at the end of World War I.\nAt the start of the Third Reich in 1933 there was a ceremonial handshake between President Paul von Hindenburg and the new Chancellor Adolf Hitler on 21 March 1933 in Potsdam's Garrison Church in what became known as the \"Day of Potsdam\". This symbolised a coalition of the military (Reichswehr) and Nazism. Potsdam was severely damaged by Allied bombing raids during World War II.\n\nThe Cecilienhof Palace was the scene of the Potsdam Conference from 17 July to 2 August 1945, at which the victorious Allied leaders (Harry S. Truman; Winston Churchill and his successor, Clement Attlee; and Joseph Stalin) met to decide the future of Germany and postwar Europe in general. The conference ended with the Potsdam Agreement and the Potsdam Declaration.\n\nThe government of East Germany (formally known as the German Democratic Republic (German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik, DDR)) tried to remove symbols of \"Prussian militarism\". Many historic buildings, some of them badly damaged in the war, were demolished.\nWhen in 1946 the remainder of the Province of Brandenburg west of the Oder-Nei\u00dfe line was constituted as the state of Brandenburg, Potsdam became its capital. In 1952 the GDR disestablished its federal states and replaced them by smaller new East German administrative districts known as Bezirke. Potsdam became the capital of the new Bezirk Potsdam until 1990.\nPotsdam, south-west of Berlin, lay just outside West Berlin after the construction of the Berlin Wall. The walling off of West Berlin not only isolated Potsdam from West Berlin, but also doubled commuting times to East Berlin. The Glienicke Bridge across the Havel connected the city to West Berlin and was the scene of some Cold War exchanges of spies.\nAfter German reunification, Potsdam became the capital of the newly re-established state of Brandenburg. Since then there have been many ideas and efforts to reconstruct the original appearance of the city, including the Potsdam City Palace and the Garrison Church.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nSince 2000 Potsdam has been one of the fastest growing cities in Germany.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== International residents ===\n\nLargest groups of foreign residents:\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\n\n=== City government ===\nPotsdam has had a mayor (B\u00fcrgermeister) and city council since the 15th century. From 1809 the city council was elected, with a mayor (Oberb\u00fcrgermeister) at its head. During the Third Reich the mayor was selected by the NSDAP and the city council was dissolved; it was reconstituted in token form after 1945, but free elections did not take place until after reunification.\nToday, the city council is the city's central administrative authority. Local elections took place on 26 October 2003 and again in 2008. Between 1990 and 1999, the Chairman of the City Council was known as the \"Town President\" but today the post is the \"Chairman of the City Council\". The mayor is elected directly by the population.\n\n\n=== Brandenburg state government ===\nThe Landtag Brandenburg, the parliament of the federal state of Brandenburg is in Potsdam. It has been housed in the Potsdam City Palace since 2014.\n\n\n== Twin towns - sister cities ==\n\nPotsdam is twinned with:\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\n\n==== Rail transport ====\nPotsdam, included in the fare zone \"C\" (Tarifbereich C) of Berlin's public transport area and fare zones A and B of its own public transport area, is served by the S7 S-Bahn line. The stations served are Griebnitzsee, Babelsberg and the Central Station (Hauptbahnhof), the main and long-distance station of the city. Other DB stations in Potsdam are Charlottenhof, Park Sanssouci (including the monumental Kaiserbahnhof), Medienstadt Babelsberg, Rehbr\u00fccke, Pirschheide and Marquardt. The city also possesses a 27 km-long tramway network.\n\n\n==== Road transport ====\nPotsdam is served by several motorways: the A 10, a beltway better known as Berliner Ring, the A 115 (using part of the AVUS) and is closely linked to the A 2 and A 9. The B 1 and B 2 federal roads cross the city. Potsdam features a network of urban and suburban buses.\n\n\n== Education and research ==\n\nPotsdam is a university town. The University of Potsdam was founded in 1991 as a university of the State of Brandenburg. Its predecessor was the Akademie f\u00fcr Staats- und Rechtswissenschaften der DDR \"Walter Ulbricht\", a college of education founded in 1948 which was one of the GDR's most important colleges. There are about 20,000 students enrolled at the university.\n\nIn 1991 the Fachhochschule Potsdam was founded as the second college. It had 3,518 students as of 2017.Konrad Wolf Film University of Babelsberg (HFF), founded in 1954 in Babelsberg, is the foremost centre of the German film industry since its birth, with over 600 students.\nThere are also several research foundations, including Fraunhofer Institutes for Applied Polymer Research and Biomedical Engineering, Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute), Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces, and Max Planck Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology, the GFZ - German Research Centre for Geosciences, the Potsdam Astrophysical Institute, the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies, The Leibniz Institute for Agricultural Engineering and Bioeconomy and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, which employs 340 people in researching climate change.As well as universities, Potsdam is home to reputable secondary schools. Montessori Gesamtschule Potsdam, in western Potsdam, attracts 400 students from the Brandenburg and Berlin region.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nPotsdam was historically a centre of European immigration. Its religious tolerance attracted people from France, Russia, the Netherlands and Bohemia. This is still visible in the culture and architecture of the city.\nThe most popular attraction in Potsdam is Sanssouci Park, 2 km (1 mi) west of the city centre. In 1744 King Frederick the Great ordered the construction of a residence here, where he could live sans souci (\"without worries\", in the French spoken at the court). The park hosts a botanical garden (Botanical Garden, Potsdam) and many buildings:\n\nThe Sanssouci Palace (Schloss Sanssouci), a relatively modest palace of the Prussian royal (and later German imperial) family\nThe Orangery Palace (Orangerieschloss), former palace for foreign royal guests\nThe New Palace (Neues Palais), built between 1763 and 1769 to celebrate the end of the Seven Years' War, in which Prussia held off the combined attacks of Austria and Russia. It is a much larger and grander palace than Sanssouci, having over 200 rooms and 400 statues as decoration. It served as a guest house for numerous royal visitors. Today, it houses parts of University of Potsdam.\nThe Charlottenhof Palace (Schloss Charlottenhof), a Neoclassical palace by Karl Friedrich Schinkel built in 1826\nThe Roman Baths (R\u00f6mische B\u00e4der), built by Karl Friedrich Schinkel and Friedrich Ludwig Persius in 1829\u20131840. It is a complex of buildings including a tea pavilion, a Renaissance-style villa, and a Roman bathhouse (from which the whole complex takes its name).\nThe Chinese Tea House (Chinesisches Teehaus), an 18th-century pavilion built in a Chinese style, the fashion of the time.Three gates from the original city wall remain today. The oldest is the Hunters' Gate (J\u00e4gertor), built in 1733. The Nauener Tor was built in 1755 and close to the historic Dutch Quarter. The ornate Brandenburg Gate (built in 1770, not to be confused with the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin) is situated on the Luisenplatz at the western entrance to the old town.\n\nThe Old Market Square (Alter Markt) is Potsdam's historical city centre. For three centuries this was the site of the City Palace (Stadtschlo\u00df), a royal palace built in 1662. Under Frederick the Great, the palace became the winter residence of the Prussian kings. The palace was severely damaged by Allied bombing in 1945 and demolished in 1961 by the Communist authorities. In 2002 the Fortuna Gate (Fortunaportal) was rebuilt in its original historic position which was followed by a complete reconstruction of the palace as the Brandenburg Landtag building inaugurated in 2014. Nearby the square in the Humboldtstra\u00dfe block, which also was demolished after getting damaged in 1945, reconstructions of several representative residential palaces including Palazzo Pompei and Palazzo Barberini housing an arts museum were completed in 2016-2017 alongside buildings with modernized facades to restore the historical proportions of the block.\n\nThe Old Market Square is dominated today by the dome of St. Nicholas' Church (Nikolaikirche), built in 1837 in the Neoclassical style. It was the last work of Karl Friedrich Schinkel, who designed the building but did not live to see its completion. It was finished by his disciples Friedrich August St\u00fcler and Ludwig Persius. The eastern side of the Market Square is dominated by the Old City Hall (Altes Rathaus), built in 1755 by the Dutch architect Jan Bouman (1706\u20131776). It has a characteristic circular tower, crowned with a gilded Atlas bearing the world on his shoulders.\n\nNorth of the Old Market Square is the oval French Church (Franz\u00f6sische Kirche), erected in the 1750s by Boumann for the Huguenot community. To the south lies the Museum Barberini, a copy of the previous building, the Barberini Palace. The museum was funded by the German billionaire Hasso Plattner. The former Baroque building was built by Carl von Gontard in 1771\u20131772, inspired by the Renaissance palace Palazzo Barberini in Rome. The newly built museum was scheduled to open in spring 2017.\nAnother landmark of Potsdam is the two-street Dutch Quarter (Holl\u00e4ndisches Viertel), an ensemble of buildings that is unique in Europe, with about 150 houses built of red bricks in the Dutch style. It was built between 1734 and 1742 under the direction of Jan Bouman to be used by Dutch artisans and craftsmen who had been invited to settle here by King Frederick Wilhelm I. Today, this area is one of Potsdam's most visited quarters.\nNorth of the city centre is the Russian colony of Alexandrowka, a small enclave of Russian architecture (including an Orthodox chapel) built in 1825 for a group of Russian immigrants. Since 1999, the colony has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin.\nEast of the Alexandrowka colony is a large park, the New Garden (Neuer Garten), which was laid out from 1786 in the English style. The site contains two palaces; one of them, the Cecilienhof, was where the Potsdam Conference was held in July and August 1945. The Marmorpalais (Marble Palace) was built in 1789 in Neoclassical style. Nearby is the Biosph\u00e4re Potsdam, a tropical botanical garden.\nBabelsberg, a quarter south-east of the centre, houses the UFA film studios (Babelsberg Studios), and an extensive park with some historical buildings, including the Babelsberg Palace (Schlo\u00df Babelsberg, a Gothic revival palace designed by Schinkel).\nThe Einstein Tower is located within the Albert Einstein Science Park, which is on the top of the Telegraphenberg within an astronomy compound.\nPotsdam also features a memorial centre in the former KGB prison in Leistikowstra\u00dfe. In the Volkspark to the north, there is one of the last monuments dedicated to Lenin in Germany.\nPotsdam joined UNESCO's Network of Creative Cities as a Design City on October 31, 2019 on the occasion of World Cities\u2019 Day.\n\n\n== Parks ==\nThere are many parks in Potsdam, most of them UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

          "In a small space much accommodated, top. It was a revelation, at least for me, what diversity there is in the domestic fauna and how many species are endangered. Really well done and highly recommended.\n\n",
          "Conveniently located in the city center, near the bus stop. There is a permanent exposition, there are changing exhibitions. It is located in an old beautiful building. The only downside is the inadequate time of \u2026",

          "We were surprised by the size of this museum. The whole prison has been converted to a museum. The exhibition explains in detail the history of the building and stories of the prisoners. It's a very powerful museum and memorial site. Ask for a booklet in English from the ticket",
          "I did not think I would be so interested in Potsdam! This was an excellent museum with some genuinely interesting and engaging exhibits. The museum was laid out chronologically and I particularly found the medieval aspects of the town to be of interest. The only small",
          "There is a lot of history here for only about 3 Euros. Prior reviews mention descriptions being in German only, but most of the exhibits had signs and descriptions in English below the ones in German, so they may have been recently added.There is also a special exhibit room",
          "I have been to Potsdam several times and have always missed going here. From the outside it looks like an ordinary villa, but behind is an entire prison. The thought that this was in use not that long ago makes the horrors of the time more confronting. Everything is in German",
          "From the outside you could be forgiven for thinking this is a small museum. It isn't. It goes on and on, a testimony to the many innocent people imprisoned by the Stasi during the Cold War. Every now and then a display in one of the rooms will capture you and drag you in, so",
          "This was an amazing experience, one I shall never forget. The tour guide was a brilliant Spanish lady who knew everything that had happened here. Everything had been well preserved. As a group we were introduced to an ex-inmate who gave this place a human touch as he discussed",
          "While we were visiting at the Brandenburg Gate one must definitely check out this museum. So much history and even brought up a few sad memories. Berlin today has most definitely changed. No matter what, be sure to check out the Nazi and Stasi Museum while in Berlin. It is",

          "An absolutely excellently preserved prison museum - 3 floors of cells each with its own story to tell. Unfortunately all exhibits are described in German only although I was given a brief guide book at the entrance in English but it was not well coordinated with the museum"

        "wiki": "Wannsee (German: [\u02c8van\u02ccze\u02d0] (listen)) is a locality in the southwestern Berlin borough of Steglitz-Zehlendorf, Germany. It is the westernmost locality of Berlin. In the quarter there are two lakes, the larger Gro\u00dfer Wannsee (Greater Wannsee) and the Kleiner Wannsee (Little Wannsee), are located on the River Havel and are separated only by the Wannsee Bridge. The larger of the two lakes covers an area of 2.7 km2 (1.0 sq mi) and has a maximum depth of 9 m (30 ft)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\nAt the western rim of the Wannsee locality the Glienicke Bridge connects it with the city of Potsdam. The late neoclassical Glienicke Palace as well as the Pfaueninsel are nearby. Since 1990 these palaces and parks are part of the Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe locality is centred on the ancient village of Stolpe, known to exist in 1299. The locality also includes the districts of Kohlhasenbr\u00fcck, named after the 1811 novella Michael Kohlhaas by Heinrich von Kleist, and Steinst\u00fccken, which in the Cold War days became famous as a tiny exclave of West Berlin within the GDR.\n\n\n=== Gro\u00dfer and Kleiner Wannsee ===\n\nWannsee lake is well known as the number-one bathing and recreation spot for western Berlin, especially from a 1951 Schlager hit by teen idol Cornelia Froboess. The Strandbad Wannsee, an open-air lido with one of the longest inland beaches in Europe and a popular nudist area, was built in 1929\u20131930 after a concept by architect Richard Ermisch. Situated on the eastern shore of the lake it is officially part of the Nikolassee locality.\n\n\n=== Subdivision ===\nWannsee is divided into 5 zones (Ortslagen):\n\nAm Sandwerder\nHeckeshorn\nKohlhasenbr\u00fcck\nSteinst\u00fccken\nStolpe\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe history of Wannsee as a sublime suburb of Berlin began when \"Great Elector\" Frederick William of Brandenburg ordered the construction of a hunting lodge, the Jagdschloss Glienicke. The castle remained for generations the hunting lodge of the Hohenzollern family and was rebuilt and expanded several times during this time. Today the castle houses an institute for social education.\nIn 1793, the Prussian king Frederick William II, a descendant of Frederick William, acquired the island Pfaueninsel (German: \"Peacock Island\") in the Havel river and had the Pfaueninsel castle built for himself and his mistress Wilhelmine Enke in 1794\u20131797. Jagdschloss Glienicke and Pfaueninsel castle are both part of UNESCO World Heritage Site Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin.\nOn 21 November 1811, German writer Heinrich von Kleist shot himself on the shore of the Kleiner Wannsee and, at her bidding, his lover, Henriette Vogel. A memorial marks the site.\n\nGlienicke Palace (German: Schloss Glienicke) was designed in neoclassical style by Karl Friedrich Schinkel for Prince Carl of Prussia in 1826. It used to be the summer palace of the prince. Together with the Russian style ensemble Nikolskoe around the church Ss. Peter and Paul (German: St. Peter und Paul) on the top of a hill on the banks of the Havel river, it also belongs to the UNESCO World Heritage Site Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin.\nNikolskoe, consisting of the church, a cottage, a school and a cemetery, was established from 1813 to 1837 at the suggestion by the Russian Empress Alexandra Feodorovna, the daughter of King Frederick William III of Prussia. Her brother Prince Carl, constructor of Glienicke Palace, was buried in the church after his death. Today the church is especially popular for weddings and the cottage is housing a restaurant.\nThe Verein Seglerhaus am Wannsee, the second oldest yacht club in Germany, was established in October 1867 on a small wooden shack by River Havel. In 1877 it moved to its present location at the edge of the lake.\nIn 1909, Max Liebermann, head of the Berlin Secession, had a villa built at the western shore of the Wannsee. His widow was forced to sell it to the Deutsche Reichspost in 1940. Today, the property is a museum in honor of the painter. Especially worth seeing is the garden, which was a popular Liebermann motif.\n\nIn 1928, a large shooting range was established in the D\u00fcppel woods near the Berlin city limits. It was the site of the shooting part of the shooting events of the 1936 Summer Olympics. A golf course hosted the running part of the modern pentathlon at those same games. After World War II, it was used by the US Army as the \"Rose Range\" firing compound. In 1994, the shooting range was returned from the allies to Germany, and is today used by the DEVA institute.\nOn 20 January 1942, senior Nazi officials met at the Wannsee Villa (built 1914\u20131915) to ensure the cooperation of the major government organizations in the Final Solution to the \"Jewish Question\", the extermination of the Jews of Europe. The event, presided over by Reinhard Heydrich and conducted by Adolf Eichmann, has since become known as the Wannsee Conference. Today, the building serves as a memorial and education centre.\nIn 1944, after the failure of the assassination attempt on Hitler in which he had been involved, senior SS and Gestapo official Arthur Nebe went into hiding on an island in the Wannsee but was later arrested after a rejected mistress betrayed him.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nWannsee is served by the Berlin S-Bahn lines S1, as terminus, and S7, at the Berlin-Wannsee railway station. It is also a stop of some long-distance trains as well as of RegionalExpress and RegionalBahn trains of Deutsche Bahn and Transdev Germany. Wannsee is also linked to Kladow by Berlin ferry line F10.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe Japanische Internationale Schule zu Berlin, a Japanese international school, is in Wannsee.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nLiebermann-Villa\nIsted Lion of Berlin\nWannsee Conference\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n1936 Summer Olympics official report.

          "An excellent display documenting the evolution of antisemitism into the Final Solution. A decision that was finalised in this deceptively attractive location. The information is well judged, plenty too look at and inform the visitor without overwhelming.",
          "Well presented and detailed on a sensitive topic",
          "Excellent documentation for all aspects of the theme. Transport is simple using Bus 114 from S-Bahn Wannsee, which runs every 20 minutes.",

          "A good narrative of the events leading up to & as a consequence of the Wannsee Conference, with display boards of the key protagonists. Roma & disabled victims were mentioned, but political & gay victims seemed overlooked sadly",

          "Where the Nazi regime officially made The Final Solution government policy. All the documents and minutes of the meeting are on display, along with illustrations of the bureaucratic structures. Serves to remind how easy for people and \u2026",

The contrast between the serenity of the place and the evil nature of the events that took place here is important. ",

        "wiki": "With the Museum Barberini, the city of Potsdam has gained in 2017 a new art venue, whose exhibitions range from the Old Masters to contemporary art, with an emphasis on impressionist painting. Centered around works from the collection of its founder and patron Hasso Plattner, who funded the reconstruction of the destroyed palace, the Barberini presents three temporary exhibitions per year, featuring loans from international museums and private collections. Academic conferences with international curators and researchers serve to prepare these exhibitions. At the same time, shorter gallery displays \u2013 the so-called \u201cart histories\u201d \u2013 put works from the collection into constantly shifting contexts. A diverse programme of events and educational activities as well as digital offers like the Barberini App and the 4K Smart Wall in the museum make art more accessible for everyone. \nThe director of the Museum Barberini is Ortrud Westheider.\n\n\n== Exhibitions and Collection ==\nThe art gallery exhibits Plattner\u2019s collection of art from the former German Democratic Republic, as well as special exhibitions that range from the Old Masters to contemporary art with a focus on impressionism, including works by Rodin, Monet and Edvard Munch. Three temporary exhibitions are planned each year, with major loan collections from international museums and private collections.\nIn its opening year in 2017, the Museum Barberini has begun its programme of exhibitions with four major shows, all of which were based on international cooperations and supported by key loans from numerous museums around the world, including the State Hermitage in St. Petersburg, the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay in Paris and the National Gallery of Art in Washington: Modern Classics, Impressionism: The Art of Landscape, From Hopper to Rothko: America\u2019s Road to Modern Art and Behind the Mask: Artists in the GDR. The last of these was based on the museum\u2019s collection of the GDR painting, which still occupies a marginalized position in German art history. The show assembled over 100 works by ca. 80 artists active in the fields of painting, photography, collage, sculpture and works on paper.\nIn 2018, the Barberini\u2019s Beckmann retrospective was the first ever show to explore the artist\u2019s fascination with the concept of the world as a stage. The exhibition brought together more than 110 works from German and international museums and private collections, including the Harvard Art Museum in Boston, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Nationalgalerie in Berlin and the Tate Modern in London, and featured many masterpieces that had hardly been shown in Europe before. \nThe exhibition Gerhard Richter. Abstraction (Summer 2018) was the first to focus on abstract strategies and procedures in the artist\u2019s oeuvre. Inspired by a new acquisition of the Museum Barberini, the critically acclaimed show was developed in close collaboration with the artist and explored the relationship and meanings of abstraction and the object in Richter\u2019s work from the 1960s to the present day, including the role of photography and color, overpainting and exposure. The exhibition brought together around 80 works from international museum and private collections, including the Gerhard Richter Archive and the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen in Dresden, the Collezione Prada in Milan and the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Serralves, Museu de Arte Contempor\u00e2nea in Porto. \nFrom November 2018 till February 2019, the Barberini hosted the first retrospective of the neo-impressionist painter Henri-Edmond Cross (1856\u20131910) in Germany. Around 1900, Cross was regarded as one of the most important representatives of the French avant-garde and was known for his light-flooded depictions of the Riviera. The retrospective included numerous neo-impressionist masterpieces from museums such as the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay in Paris, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, the Museo Nacional Thyssen-Bornemisza in Madrid and the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen. Their loans were complemented by selected key works from international private collections that are otherwise not accessible to the public. \nFrom March 9 to June 16, 2019, a major show is dedicated to Picasso\u2019s late work, featuring more than 130 works from the collection of his last wife Jacqueline, including paintings, drawings, collages, sculptures and ceramics. From July to October 2019, more than 50 masterpieces from the national galleries Barberini Corsini in Rome can be seen in the show Baroque Pathways, including Caravaggio\u2019s painting Narcissus (1597/99). The last exhibition of the year, Van Gogh. Still Lifes (October 2019 \u2013 February 2020) is the first ever exhibition on this theme. The show, which was conceived in cooperation with the Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum in Otterlo and the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, analyzes the decisive stages in van Gogh\u2019s oeuvre and life with over 20 paintings, including major loans from the Art Institute of Chicago and the National Gallery of Art in Washington.\n\n\n== Publications of the Museum Barberini ==\nImpressionism: The Art of Landscape (2017)\nFrom Hopper to Rothko: America's Road to Modern Art (2017)\nBehind the Mask: Artists in the GDR (2017)\nMax Beckmann: The World as a Stage (2017)\nAre Communists Allowed to Dream?

        "wiki": "Potsdam (German pronunciation: [\u02c8p\u0254t\u0361sdam] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of the German federal state of Brandenburg. It directly borders the German capital, Berlin, and is part of the Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region. It is situated on the River Havel some 25 kilometres (16 miles) southwest of Berlin's city centre.\nPotsdam was a residence of the Prussian kings and the German Kaiser until 1918. Its planning embodied ideas of the Age of Enlightenment: through a careful balance of architecture and landscape, Potsdam was intended as \"a picturesque, pastoral dream\" which would remind its residents of their relationship with nature and reason.The city lies in an area of interconnected lakes and is distinguished by a series of cultural landmarks, in particular the parks and palaces of Sanssouci, the largest World Heritage Site in Germany. The Potsdam Conference in 1945 was held at Cecilienhof Palace.\nBabelsberg, in the south-eastern part of Potsdam, was already by the 1930s the home of a major film production studio and it has enjoyed success as an important center of European film production since the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Filmstudio Babelsberg is the oldest large-scale film studio in the world.Potsdam developed into a centre of science in Germany in the 19th century. Today, there are three public colleges, the University of Potsdam, and more than 30 research institutes in the city.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe area was formed from a series of large moraines left after the last glacial period. Today, only one quarter of the city is built up, the rest remaining as green space.\nThere are about 20 lakes and rivers in and around Potsdam, such as the Havel, the Griebnitzsee, Templiner See, Tiefer See, Jungfernsee, Teltowkanal, Heiliger See, and Sacrower See. The highest point is the 114-metre (374 ft) high Kleiner Ravensberg.\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\nPotsdam is divided into seven historic city Bezirke and nine new Stadtteile (villages), which joined the city in 2003. The appearance of the city quarters is quite different. Those in the north and in the centre consist mainly of historical buildings, the south of the city is dominated by larger areas of newer buildings.\nThe city of Potsdam is divided into 34 Stadtteile (or quarters), which are divided further into 84 statistical Bezirke.\nToday one distinguishes between the older parts of the city (areas of the historic city and places suburbanized at the latest in 1939) - these are the city center, the western and northern suburbs, Bornim, Bornstedt, Nedlitz, Potsdam South, Babelsberg, Drewitz, Stern and Kirchsteigfeld - and those communities incorporated after 1990 which have since 2003 become Stadtteile - these are Eiche, Fahrland, Golm, Gro\u00df Glienicke, Grube, Marquardt, Neu Fahrland, Satzkorn and Uetz-Paaren. The new Stadtteile are located mainly in the north of the city. For the history of all incorporations, see the relevant section on incorporation and spin-offs.\nStructure with statistical numbering:\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nOfficially the climate is oceanic - more degraded by being far from the coast and to the east (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), but using the 1961-1990 normal and the 0 \u00b0C isotherm the city has a humid continental climate (Dfb), which also shows a slight influence of the continent different from the climates predominantly influenced by the Atlantic Ocean. Low averages below freezing for almost all winter causing snows that are frequent and winters are cold, but not as stringent as inland locations or with greater influence from the same. Summer is also relatively warm with temperatures between 23 and 24 \u00b0C, the heat waves being influenced by the UHI of Potsdam.The average winter high temperature is 3.5 \u00b0C (38.3 \u00b0F), with a low of \u22121.7 \u00b0C (28.9 \u00b0F). Snow is common in the winter. Spring and autumn are short. Summers are mild, with a high of 23.6 \u00b0C (74.5 \u00b0F) and a low of 12.7 \u00b0C (54.9 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Potsdam\" originally seems to have been Poztupimi. A common theory is that it derives from an old West Slavonic term meaning \"beneath the oaks\", i.e., the corrupted pod dubmi/dubimi (pod \"beneath\", dub \"oak\"). However some question this explanation.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre- and early history ===\n\nThe area around Potsdam shows signs of occupancy since the Bronze Age and was part of Magna Germania as described by Tacitus. After the great migrations of the Germanic peoples, Slavs moved in and Potsdam was probably founded after the 7th century as a settlement of the Hevelli tribe centred on a castle. It was first mentioned in a document in 993 as Poztupimi, when Emperor Otto III gifted the territory to the Quedlinburg Abbey, then led by his aunt Matilda. By 1317, it was mentioned as a small town. It gained its town charter in 1345. In 1573, it was still a small market town of 2,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n=== Early modern era ===\nPotsdam lost nearly half of its population due to the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648).\nA continuous Hohenzollern possession since 1415, Potsdam became prominent, when it was chosen in 1660 as the hunting residence of Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg, the core of the powerful state that later became the Kingdom of Prussia. It also housed Prussian barracks.\n\nAfter the Edict of Potsdam in 1685, Potsdam became a centre of European immigration. Its religious freedom attracted people from France (Huguenots), Russia, the Netherlands and Bohemia. The edict accelerated population growth and economic recovery.\nLater, the city became a full residence of the Prussian royal family. The buildings of the royal residences were built mainly during the reign of Frederick the Great. One of these is the Sanssouci Palace (French: \"without cares\", by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff, 1744), famed for its formal gardens and Rococo interiors. Other royal residences include the New Palace and the Orangery.\nIn 1815, at the formation of the Province of Brandenburg, Potsdam became the provincial capital until 1918, except for a period between 1827 and 1843 when Berlin was the provincial capital (as it became once again after 1918). The province comprised two governorates named after their capitals Potsdam and Frankfurt (Oder).\n\n\n=== Governorate of Potsdam ===\n\nBetween 1815 and 1945, the city of Potsdam served as capital of the governorate of Potsdam (German: Regierungsbezirk Potsdam). The Regierungsbezirk encompassed the former districts of Uckermark, the Mark of Priegnitz, and the greater part of the Middle March. It was situated between Mecklenburg and the Province of Pomerania on the north, and the Province of Saxony on the south and west (Berlin, with a small surrounding district, was an urban governorate and enclave within the governorate of Potsdam between 1815 and 1822, then it merged as urban district into the governorate only to be disentangled again from Potsdam governorate in 1875, becoming a distinct province-like entity on 1 April 1881). Towards the north west the governorate was bounded by the rivers Elbe and the Havel, and on the north east by the Oder. The south eastern boundary was to the neighbouring governorate of Frankfurt (Oder). About 500,000 inhabitants lived in the Potsdam governorate, which covered an area of about 20,700 square kilometres (7,992 sq mi), divided into thirteen rural districts, partially named after their capitals:\nThe traditional towns in the governorate were small, however, in the course of the industrial labour migration some reached the rank of urban districts. The principal towns were Brandenburg upon Havel, K\u00f6penick, Potsdam, Prenzlau, Spandau and Ruppin. Until 1875 Berlin also was a town within the governorate. After its disentanglement a number of its suburbs outside Berlin's municipal borders grew to towns, many forming urban Bezirke within the governorate of Potsdam such as Charlottenburg, Lichtenberg, Rixdorf (after 1912 Neuk\u00f6lln), and Sch\u00f6neberg (all of which, as well as K\u00f6penick and Spandau, incorporated into Greater Berlin in 1920). The urban Bezirke were (years indicating the elevation to rank of urban Bezirkor affiliation with Potsdam governorate, respectively):\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nBerlin was the capital of Prussia and later of the German Empire, but the court remained in Potsdam, where many government officials settled. In 1914, Emperor Wilhelm II signed the Declaration of War in the Neues Palais (New Palace). The city lost its status as a \"second capital\" in 1918, when Wilhelm II abdicated and Germany became a Republic at the end of World War I.\nAt the start of the Third Reich in 1933 there was a ceremonial handshake between President Paul von Hindenburg and the new Chancellor Adolf Hitler on 21 March 1933 in Potsdam's Garrison Church in what became known as the \"Day of Potsdam\". This symbolised a coalition of the military (Reichswehr) and Nazism. Potsdam was severely damaged by Allied bombing raids during World War II.\n\nThe Cecilienhof Palace was the scene of the Potsdam Conference from 17 July to 2 August 1945, at which the victorious Allied leaders (Harry S. Truman; Winston Churchill and his successor, Clement Attlee; and Joseph Stalin) met to decide the future of Germany and postwar Europe in general. The conference ended with the Potsdam Agreement and the Potsdam Declaration.\n\nThe government of East Germany (formally known as the German Democratic Republic (German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik, DDR)) tried to remove symbols of \"Prussian militarism\". Many historic buildings, some of them badly damaged in the war, were demolished.\nWhen in 1946 the remainder of the Province of Brandenburg west of the Oder-Nei\u00dfe line was constituted as the state of Brandenburg, Potsdam became its capital. In 1952 the GDR disestablished its federal states and replaced them by smaller new East German administrative districts known as Bezirke. Potsdam became the capital of the new Bezirk Potsdam until 1990.\nPotsdam, south-west of Berlin, lay just outside West Berlin after the construction of the Berlin Wall. The walling off of West Berlin not only isolated Potsdam from West Berlin, but also doubled commuting times to East Berlin. The Glienicke Bridge across the Havel connected the city to West Berlin and was the scene of some Cold War exchanges of spies.\nAfter German reunification, Potsdam became the capital of the newly re-established state of Brandenburg. Since then there have been many ideas and efforts to reconstruct the original appearance of the city, including the Potsdam City Palace and the Garrison Church.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nSince 2000 Potsdam has been one of the fastest growing cities in Germany.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== International residents ===\n\nLargest groups of foreign residents:\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\n\n=== City government ===\nPotsdam has had a mayor (B\u00fcrgermeister) and city council since the 15th century. From 1809 the city council was elected, with a mayor (Oberb\u00fcrgermeister) at its head. During the Third Reich the mayor was selected by the NSDAP and the city council was dissolved; it was reconstituted in token form after 1945, but free elections did not take place until after reunification.\nToday, the city council is the city's central administrative authority. Local elections took place on 26 October 2003 and again in 2008. Between 1990 and 1999, the Chairman of the City Council was known as the \"Town President\" but today the post is the \"Chairman of the City Council\". The mayor is elected directly by the population.\n\n\n=== Brandenburg state government ===\nThe Landtag Brandenburg, the parliament of the federal state of Brandenburg is in Potsdam. It has been housed in the Potsdam City Palace since 2014.\n\n\n== Twin towns - sister cities ==\n\nPotsdam is twinned with:\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\n\n==== Rail transport ====\nPotsdam, included in the fare zone \"C\" (Tarifbereich C) of Berlin's public transport area and fare zones A and B of its own public transport area, is served by the S7 S-Bahn line. The stations served are Griebnitzsee, Babelsberg and the Central Station (Hauptbahnhof), the main and long-distance station of the city. Other DB stations in Potsdam are Charlottenhof, Park Sanssouci (including the monumental Kaiserbahnhof), Medienstadt Babelsberg, Rehbr\u00fccke, Pirschheide and Marquardt. The city also possesses a 27 km-long tramway network.\n\n\n==== Road transport ====\nPotsdam is served by several motorways: the A 10, a beltway better known as Berliner Ring, the A 115 (using part of the AVUS) and is closely linked to the A 2 and A 9. The B 1 and B 2 federal roads cross the city. Potsdam features a network of urban and suburban buses.\n\n\n== Education and research ==\n\nPotsdam is a university town. The University of Potsdam was founded in 1991 as a university of the State of Brandenburg. Its predecessor was the Akademie f\u00fcr Staats- und Rechtswissenschaften der DDR \"Walter Ulbricht\", a college of education founded in 1948 which was one of the GDR's most important colleges. There are about 20,000 students enrolled at the university.\n\nIn 1991 the Fachhochschule Potsdam was founded as the second college. It had 3,518 students as of 2017.Konrad Wolf Film University of Babelsberg (HFF), founded in 1954 in Babelsberg, is the foremost centre of the German film industry since its birth, with over 600 students.\nThere are also several research foundations, including Fraunhofer Institutes for Applied Polymer Research and Biomedical Engineering, Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute), Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces, and Max Planck Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology, the GFZ - German Research Centre for Geosciences, the Potsdam Astrophysical Institute, the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies, The Leibniz Institute for Agricultural Engineering and Bioeconomy and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, which employs 340 people in researching climate change.As well as universities, Potsdam is home to reputable secondary schools. Montessori Gesamtschule Potsdam, in western Potsdam, attracts 400 students from the Brandenburg and Berlin region.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nPotsdam was historically a centre of European immigration. Its religious tolerance attracted people from France, Russia, the Netherlands and Bohemia. This is still visible in the culture and architecture of the city.\nThe most popular attraction in Potsdam is Sanssouci Park, 2 km (1 mi) west of the city centre. In 1744 King Frederick the Great ordered the construction of a residence here, where he could live sans souci (\"without worries\", in the French spoken at the court). The park hosts a botanical garden (Botanical Garden, Potsdam) and many buildings:\n\nThe Sanssouci Palace (Schloss Sanssouci), a relatively modest palace of the Prussian royal (and later German imperial) family\nThe Orangery Palace (Orangerieschloss), former palace for foreign royal guests\nThe New Palace (Neues Palais), built between 1763 and 1769 to celebrate the end of the Seven Years' War, in which Prussia held off the combined attacks of Austria and Russia. It is a much larger and grander palace than Sanssouci, having over 200 rooms and 400 statues as decoration. It served as a guest house for numerous royal visitors. Today, it houses parts of University of Potsdam.\nThe Charlottenhof Palace (Schloss Charlottenhof), a Neoclassical palace by Karl Friedrich Schinkel built in 1826\nThe Roman Baths (R\u00f6mische B\u00e4der), built by Karl Friedrich Schinkel and Friedrich Ludwig Persius in 1829\u20131840. It is a complex of buildings including a tea pavilion, a Renaissance-style villa, and a Roman bathhouse (from which the whole complex takes its name).\nThe Chinese Tea House (Chinesisches Teehaus), an 18th-century pavilion built in a Chinese style, the fashion of the time.Three gates from the original city wall remain today. The oldest is the Hunters' Gate (J\u00e4gertor), built in 1733. The Nauener Tor was built in 1755 and close to the historic Dutch Quarter. The ornate Brandenburg Gate (built in 1770, not to be confused with the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin) is situated on the Luisenplatz at the western entrance to the old town.\n\nThe Old Market Square (Alter Markt) is Potsdam's historical city centre. For three centuries this was the site of the City Palace (Stadtschlo\u00df), a royal palace built in 1662. Under Frederick the Great, the palace became the winter residence of the Prussian kings. The palace was severely damaged by Allied bombing in 1945 and demolished in 1961 by the Communist authorities. In 2002 the Fortuna Gate (Fortunaportal) was rebuilt in its original historic position which was followed by a complete reconstruction of the palace as the Brandenburg Landtag building inaugurated in 2014. Nearby the square in the Humboldtstra\u00dfe block, which also was demolished after getting damaged in 1945, reconstructions of several representative residential palaces including Palazzo Pompei and Palazzo Barberini housing an arts museum were completed in 2016-2017 alongside buildings with modernized facades to restore the historical proportions of the block.\n\nThe Old Market Square is dominated today by the dome of St. Nicholas' Church (Nikolaikirche), built in 1837 in the Neoclassical style. It was the last work of Karl Friedrich Schinkel, who designed the building but did not live to see its completion. It was finished by his disciples Friedrich August St\u00fcler and Ludwig Persius. The eastern side of the Market Square is dominated by the Old City Hall (Altes Rathaus), built in 1755 by the Dutch architect Jan Bouman (1706\u20131776). It has a characteristic circular tower, crowned with a gilded Atlas bearing the world on his shoulders.\n\nNorth of the Old Market Square is the oval French Church (Franz\u00f6sische Kirche), erected in the 1750s by Boumann for the Huguenot community. To the south lies the Museum Barberini, a copy of the previous building, the Barberini Palace. The museum was funded by the German billionaire Hasso Plattner. The former Baroque building was built by Carl von Gontard in 1771\u20131772, inspired by the Renaissance palace Palazzo Barberini in Rome. The newly built museum was scheduled to open in spring 2017.\nAnother landmark of Potsdam is the two-street Dutch Quarter (Holl\u00e4ndisches Viertel), an ensemble of buildings that is unique in Europe, with about 150 houses built of red bricks in the Dutch style. It was built between 1734 and 1742 under the direction of Jan Bouman to be used by Dutch artisans and craftsmen who had been invited to settle here by King Frederick Wilhelm I. Today, this area is one of Potsdam's most visited quarters.\nNorth of the city centre is the Russian colony of Alexandrowka, a small enclave of Russian architecture (including an Orthodox chapel) built in 1825 for a group of Russian immigrants. Since 1999, the colony has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin.\nEast of the Alexandrowka colony is a large park, the New Garden (Neuer Garten), which was laid out from 1786 in the English style. The site contains two palaces; one of them, the Cecilienhof, was where the Potsdam Conference was held in July and August 1945. The Marmorpalais (Marble Palace) was built in 1789 in Neoclassical style. Nearby is the Biosph\u00e4re Potsdam, a tropical botanical garden.\nBabelsberg, a quarter south-east of the centre, houses the UFA film studios (Babelsberg Studios), and an extensive park with some historical buildings, including the Babelsberg Palace (Schlo\u00df Babelsberg, a Gothic revival palace designed by Schinkel).\nThe Einstein Tower is located within the Albert Einstein Science Park, which is on the top of the Telegraphenberg within an astronomy compound.\nPotsdam also features a memorial centre in the former KGB prison in Leistikowstra\u00dfe. In the Volkspark to the north, there is one of the last monuments dedicated to Lenin in Germany.\nPotsdam joined UNESCO's Network of Creative Cities as a Design City on October 31, 2019 on the occasion of World Cities\u2019 Day.\n\n\n== Parks ==\nThere are many parks in Potsdam, most of them UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

          "I love the quiet atmosphere on the island. Not many tourists come here but Berliners and Brandenburgers which brings a very different atmosphere to this place than any green spot in Berlin city.",
          "To cross the Havel by ferry boat\u2014 and get enchanted by the atmosphere of a beautiful park and to look at the mock medieval palace built upon request of King Friedrich Wilhelm II\u2014 trying to escape the emperial protocol atmosphere and to frolic with his mistress.Nice to see some",
          "What a find! A beautiful and peaceful place to visit for the afternoon to escape from the busy centre of Berlin. Once in a lifetime stuff!",
          "Cute, tranquil little island. I am glad they don't allow cars nor bikes on the island so that the animals can wonder freely. A haven for peacocks of this island. Arrive early to beat the crowds. There is a food stall serving drinks, sausages and cakes so you can rest on the",
          "We didn't find it as interesting as places like potsdam. The island is beautiful but not astuning. Ot is also forbiden to settle and make a picnick. And not very recommanded with a 4 year old baby, since the scenes did not worth that much of walking.",
          "It always feels like on holiday when we go there. Taking the ferry and then walking around the beatiful maintained island is great. Take a guided tour through the castle",
          "Great for a day trip. Walk to the Wannsee Conference Villa first and visit the free museum. Then walk along the water all the way to the ferry that takes you to the island. It's beautiful there, great for walking around and having a picnic. It's so so peaceful and there's a cute",

          "After cruising on the Wannsee for a couple of hours, we stopped and took a short ferry to Pfaueninsel. There are some historical buildings that date to the 1800's and some cultivated gardens. You can pretty much walk the whole island in a couple of hours including a stop for",
          "Pfaueninsel is a beautiful, tranquil island if your out and about round Potsdam or Wannsee - well worth a visit. Gets busy in the afternoons so mornings are best - especially in good weather. Peacocks and few sights and great views.",
          "I don't know why, but I never thought there would be peacocks here. Haha. But there were real peacocks freely roaming. Beautiful creatures! It's a nice nature work. Quiet and peaceful. To get there you can go to Wannsee by S-Bahn, take a bus to Pfaueninsel stop (I forgot the",
          "We went on a beautiful fall day. The colors of the leaves, the peacocks... everything was beautiful and enjoyable. Only minor aspect: the castle was closed for renovations. Hopefully we'll be going back in the spring to enjoy the flowers and changing landscape.",
          "Beautiful place to relax. Unfortunately many tourists groups with guides and many children. But for sure you will find a quiet place on this beautiful Island. You only can go by ferry - or swin :-) a perfect place to make photos.",
          "Not easy to reach unless with car and then ferry. Small place of royalties from decades ago. Recommended with visit of Potsdam",
          "Love the serenity of the island. No cars allowed. You have to use the ferry to get there. A walk around the island takes a good two hours and if you're lucky you'll see one of the peacocks.",

          "Thrilled to actually see the wild peacocks, both male and female, I enjoyed the visit to the island. From Wannsee train station (S7 and Regional trains from Berlin or Potsdam), the bus to the ferry filled up quickly. 4 Euro to take the ferry -- the only way to the island",
          "The Peacock Island can be reached by ferry (a couple of minutes crossing) and is perfect for a peaceful stroll in a park-like environment. Peacocks can be met running free on the island, and other small farm animals (i.e. roosters) can be seen at a small fold. The larger",

          "From the centre of Berlin, Pfauninsel requires a subway, train, bus, and a brief ferry ride, but this is fairly easy to navigate and costs only around 6 or 7 Euros in total for one person. Entry to the island itself is free, and is a huge area with not just the castle but",
          "If you want a somewhat simple yet engaging side tour in Berlin, go here! You can see everything within 3 hours, or take your time and spend a day here. The small palace is highly interesting - make sure to buy the camera pass when you buy the tour tickets. The old dairy farm is",
          "You get here by boat from Wannsee in the west of the city. Then just walk around the island and try and spot a peacock (Pfau). It is quite basic but has a great unspoilt feeling. Good to have children with you as it's an adventure place and they won't get lost.",
          "Very nice natural historical Island only to reach by ferry boat near the also famous Glienicker Br\u00fccke.",
          "The Island and its buildings were a little hideaway (literally!) and a fun and interesting find off the beaten path. The restaurant nearby was also excellent.",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to the island. It is a time warp, but in a good way. I would like to go back on a warmer day!!",
          "A great little island with free roaming peacocks. Costs 3 euro (return included), you have to take a ferry to get there (for about 1 minute). It's a bit out of the way the bus that goes there only comes once every two hours, so you do have to time your leave. But a great place",
          "You can easily reach here by taking the S-Bahn to Wannsee then taking the 218 bus from outside to its terminus (non-station side, go through underpass when exiting station to far-side). Once off the bus you pay the \u20ac4 ferry fare and its literally only about a 2-3 minute ride",

          "The Pfaueninsel (peacock island) is only accessible by ferry. The fare of 4 Euros seems ridiculous at first glance as the trajectory is not much longer than the boat itself. However, it also serves as the entrance fee to the vast park so it is justified. The island provides what",
          "I am not big with outdoor activities in the cold, but the short drive through the magnificent forest and the long walk on Peacock Island was perfect! Nature at it's best! The colors, the fresh air and the calm can not be found anywhere else. The buildings on the island are not",
          "This island can be accessed from Wannsee S-Bahn station with the bus 218. Just check the departure times of this nostalgic bus because it departs like once in an hour. Arriving to the Pfaueninsel dock takes almost 10 minutes. From there, the ferry departs in 20 minutes",
          "Find your way to the Pfaueninsel on a sunny day and you won't regret it. Peacocks abound under foot - and seemingly under every bush. Lovely gardens, picturesque small chateau castle hideaways of German royalty, and a fabulous aviary of beautiful birds all with the backdrop of",
          "By train and bus, Peacock Island is about an hour away from the center of town. When the 218 drops one off, there is a short walk to a ferry which has about a 2 minute crossing. I traveled on foot (no other choice) around the island. There were many peacocks some caged some",
          "We finally visited this place and were so glad we did. We came by car, and just parked as close as we could to the ferry in one of the free parking lots. The ferry ride over was 4\u20ac per person round trip, and the ferry itself runs back and forth every few mins so there isn't much",
          "Finally made it to Peacock Island following numerous previous trips to Berlin and always dropping it off the itinerary at the last minute due to the journey out of town required to get there. So glad we made the trip this time on a lovely, hot summer's day. The journey was",
          "My mother visited many times, in the late twenties and early thirties, and I have been meaning to visit Peacock Island for many years and finally managed it this year. Take a train to Wannsee and then hop on a 218 bus. The final part of the journey is the shortest ferry ride I",
          "Perfect way to spend an afternoon if you need a break from the commercial and consumerist chaos of the city. Just a short trip on public transport from Charlottenburg through the forest, it's amazing that such rural delights exist so close to a major city. Walking around the",
          "Quiet and gentle retreat from the city bustle - a very special place. Accessible by ferry (4\u20ac return) which runs according to demand, rather than a timetable, the island offers secluded walks and unexpected surprises in its unique buildings. The peacocks are stunning and the",
          "Pfauenisel has convenient public transportation, you can just take the bus 218 from S bahn Wannsee station. It's a protected area, which you can enjoy the beautiful natural and amazing peacocks and peahens. In the middle of the island is a wide lawn area, where you can just",
          "Personally I would rate this one of the best places to explore outside central Berlin and a must-see if you have more than a week at your disposal, with the competing places being: Potsdam/Park Sansouci, Tempelhofer Feld (former airport), Sachsenhausen KZ (Nazi concentration",
          "The aviary is the highlight of the visit to the island. Unless going on a weekend, it is best to do-ordinate with the bus schedule taking visitors to the ferry. We had a nice 3 km walk to the ferry through an interesting forest in Wansee, but this would be too long for most",
          "Very beautiful nature and a very nice ride here on an old bus. Do go here in the summer when it's warm and bring a pick-nick.",
          "an idyllic island for a Sunday picnic, walking, playing, with birds around, lovely trees, castle atc",

          "All of the region is full of beautiful pictures, lovely peacocks with no fear of visitors, castles, walking roads inside the forests. Calm environment full of oxygen.",
          "I visited the island on a lovely sunny day in October, and was blown away by its beauty. The wildlife here is wonderful and it serves as a great remedy to the busy city! Thewildwonderfulwowonderful and",

          "After a beautiful bus ride through the forest, which you can do even in a historic retro bus from the 60's or 70's of the last century, you are in for a surprisingly short but memorable ferry trip to the island, where you can meet some free roaming ... peacocks in beautiful",
          "If you like a day outside the hussle of the town this is the place. It is nice to walk around, however, most of the peacocks are around the Coffee on the law place, where you can sit and have a drink or icecream. If you do not meet any peacocks while walking you can take",
          "Dint make the same mistake as us and go with stern und Kreis as ferry to get there, very long trip and although scenic eats right into your time on the island!",
          "A beautiful island. Great walks. Don't expect playgrounds or football pitches. Bring some small snacks and enjoy walking and having a picnic on the island. There is a cafe on the main grass area where we had a drink and some cake. All nice, but it wouldn't be a lunch experience.",
          "A lovely peaceful island (at least later in the day, after the coach parties had left). We travelled from Gr\u00fcnewald to the ferry on a retro holiday bus number 218. If you have a transport card for A&B, this is included. The ferry is about 4 Euros. It is quite a simple island",
          "Getting to Pfaueninsel is part of the excursion. Take bus 218 from Theodor-Heuss-Platz U-Bahn station. It leaves at 15 minutes past each hour from 10am. Most of the 45 minute journey is through the Grunewald. If you want to skip this part of the journey you can catch the bus at",
          "to arrive to the island one needs to take the ferry that cost 4 ero. .The island is simply amazing, just breathtaking and fills you with peace and tranquility So fun to hang out there, the island is not crowded with tourists . few Beautiful peacocks and other animals .",
          "Peacock Is.and is about an hour by public transport from the centre of Berlin. It's small island where King Whilhelm 2 built a summer palace in 1794. There are a number of other buildings on the island including an abbey which are all within easy walking distance . The bus from",
          "Start with the ferry to the island, you have wonderful vista laid out before you, the trip in 2014, the Schloss had an artificial 'door' to it (Renovations?), but the grounds are there to wander, might even see a peacock spread his tail AND if you are really lucky, you might",
          "We had a nice boat trip almost around the Wannsee island before taking the small ferry to the Peacock island. The boat stopped close to the ferry quay. The island is developed as a park, with wide unpaved roads, benches and informative signs. The many and different trees with",
          "You start with a little shuttle barge across the wassen to this island. Apparently a world Heratige site. After about 2 minutes there, you know why. THe walk is lovely, with historic buildings, gardens and peacocks every where. It was nice to see them in a natural setting. Old",
          "1 day is needed for this trip. Must visit for couple , family and nature lovers. Goto Wansee station and take 218 bus to its last stop. A boat will take you to island which is just 2 min ride. Find out last bus timing in evening and plan day accordingly. Carry lots of food ,",
          "Took a boat trip from Wannsee and stopped off at Peacock Island for a few hours and we are glad we did as the island is green and beautiful with plenty of footpaths to walk along to make sure you see all of the islands delights. Unfortunately we never had as long as we would",
          "Took a trip to Lake Wannsee and then the ferry to this island with the family today. Had a great time walking around this beautiful green island complete with wild peacocks (that are not afraid of people and will eat out of your hand!), an 18th century faux castle and many",
          "nice island within the city limits. Stopped on our seven lake ship tour to visit the island. After arriving by the ferry's landing point, there was a long queue of guests, it took around 30 minutes to board the ferry, and you have to expect to pay 3 Euros for it, which i think",
          "I read about Peacock Island & as I love Peacocks I just had to visit. I honestly had not encountered Peacocks in many years so this was very exciting for me. My husband & I took the bus which drops you off at Peacock Island and as it's the very last stop you don't have to worry",
          "If you'll be tired of Berlin architectural attractions one day you have to know about this charming place where you could rest a while from the stone jungle. At the island you'll have a lot of walking by well organized pathways with the benches along, a lot of great scenery",
          "It's incredible that a place like Pfaueninsel exists within city limits, as the island and surrounding woodlands of the area really feel about as far from a city as possible. Getting to Pfaueninsel is very straightforward by public transport as there's a bus that runs from",
          "It's like being on a different planet after the short ferry crossing from the mainland. Wonderful walks with spectacular views ... and really a lot more to see than just peacocks (the 'peacock's menagerie with the animal cages is the oldest still existing in Europe!)",
          "a quiet, relaxing day away from the busy city - beautiful, winding park paths open surprising views with every turn and corner; ideally for families with small kids enjoying domestic and wild animals on safe trails with playground and picknick facilities -",
          "If you want to spend some peaceful time with your family or want to arrange a picnic for a group of friends or family, this surely is a good option. Not only the island itself but also the way that leads there is very beautiful indeed! Simply go to S Wannsee station and then",
          "This is a magical island, but I'm biased as I used to spend my holidays here as a child. Peace and quiet descended once all the visitors left and we had the place to ourselves at the end of the day. Woken up by the peacocks in the morning - that sound always transports me back"

        "wiki": "The Obelisk entrance (German Obeliskportal) constitutes the eastern limit of Sanssouci Park in Potsdam, Germany. Following plans by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff,  Frederick the Great ordered in 1747 that this exit from the park be built.\nThe New Palace, built at a later date, stands in the line of sight of the entrance; the two are connected by the roughly 2 km long main alley.\nTwo sandstone statues from the workshop of the sculptor Friedrich Christian Glume stand next to the pillars positioned in a square, right and left from the lower gateway to the park. Flora, the goddess of flowers, and Pomona, the goddess of fruit, draw attention to the fusion of the ornamental and kitchen garden styles in the park.\n\nThe obelisk entrance was used in Frederick's time solely as an exit from the park. This is the reason that the figures look into the interior of the park, so that they can say farewell to the guests. \nThe name of the palace is written a few steps beyond the obelisk. Likewise sketched by von Knobelsdorff, it indicates the boundary of Sanssouci Park.\nThe decorative hieroglyphs were given over to the imagination of the artist and thus contain no text, as in the 18th Century a translation of the ancient characters was not possible.\n\n\n== References ==\nThis article is based on a translation from the German article\n\n\n== External links ==\nPotsdam from Above - Obelisk",
        "brit": "Obelisk,  tapered monolithic pillar, originally erected in pairs at the entrances of ancient Egyptian temples. The Egyptian obelisk was carved from a single piece of stone, usually red granite from the quarries at Asw\u0101n. It was designed to be wider at its square or rectangular base than at its pyramidal top, which was often covered with an alloy of gold and silver called electrum. All four sides of the obelisk\u2019s shaft are embellished with hieroglyphs that characteristically include religious dedications, usually to the sun god, and commemorations of the rulers. While obelisks are known to have been erected as early as the 4th dynasty (c. 2575\u20132465 bce), no examples from that era have survived. Obelisks of the 5th dynasty\u2019s sun temples were comparatively squat (no more than 10 feet [3.3 metres] tall). The earliest surviving obelisk dates from the reign of Sesostris I (1918\u20131875 bce) and stands at Heliopolis, a suburb of Cairo, where once stood a temple to Re. One of a pair of obelisks erected at Karnak by Thutmose I (c. 1493\u2013c. 1482 bce) is 80 feet (24 metres) high, square at the base, with sides of 6 feet (1.8 metres), and 143 tons in weight.Paris: Luxor ObeliskLuxor Obelisk, removed from Luxor, Egypt, in 1831 and reerected in the Place de la Concorde, Paris.Dennis Jarvis (CC-BY-2.0) (A Britannica Publishing Partner)Luxor, Egypt: obeliskObelisk and statuary, Luxor, Egypt.\u00a9 Goodshoot/JupiterimagesKarnak: temple complexObelisks at the temple complex of Karnak, Egypt.\u00a9 Ron Gatepain (A Britannica Publishing Partner)An inscription on the base of Hatshepsut\u2019s 97-foot (30-metre) standing obelisk at Karnak indicates that the work of cutting that particular monolith out of the quarry took seven months. In the Temple of Hatshepsut at Thebes are scenes of the transport of the obelisk down the Nile by barge. At its destination workmen put the shaft into place upon its detached base by hauling it up a ramp made of earth and tilting it.Other peoples, including the Phoenicians and the Canaanites, produced obelisks after Egyptian models, although not generally carved from a single block of stone.During the time of the Roman emperors, many obelisks were transported from Egypt to what is now Italy. At least a dozen went to the city of Rome itself, including one now in the Piazza San Giovanni in Laterano that was originally erected by Thutmose III (reigned 1479\u20131426 bce) at Karnak. With a height of 105 feet (32 metres) and a square base with sides of 9 feet (2.7 metres) that tapers to a square top with sides of 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 metres), it weighs approximately 230 tons and is the largest ancient obelisk extant.St. Peter's BasilicaSt. Peter's Basilica and the Vatican obelisk in St. Peter's Square, Vatican City. \u00a9 Ron Gatepain (A Britannica Publishing Partner)\r\nGet exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription. \r\nSubscribe today\nLate in the 19th century the government of Egypt divided a pair of obelisks, giving one to the United States and the other to Great Britain. One now stands in Central Park, New York City, and the other on the Thames embankment in London. Although known as Cleopatra\u2019s Needles, they have no historical connection with the Egyptian queen. They were dedicated at Heliopolis by Thutmose III and bear inscriptions to him and to Ramses II (reigned c. 1279\u2013c. 1213 bce). Carved from the typical red granite, they stand 69 feet 6 inches (21.2 metres) high, have a rectangular base that is 7 feet 9 inches by 7 feet 8 inches (2.36 metres by 2.33 metres), and weigh 180 tons. The quarrying and erecting of these pillars is a measure of the mechanical genius and the unlimited manpower available to the ancient Egyptians.Cleopatra's NeedleCleopatra's Needle in Alexandria, Egypt, c. 1880.

        "wiki": "Charlottenburg Palace (German: Schloss Charlottenburg) is a Baroque palace in Berlin, located in Charlottenburg, a district of the Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf borough.\nThe palace was built at the end of the 17th century and was greatly expanded during the 18th century. It includes much lavish internal decoration in baroque and rococo styles. A large formal garden surrounded by woodland was added behind the palace, including a belvedere, a mausoleum, a theatre and a pavilion. During the Second World War, the palace was badly damaged but has since been reconstructed. The palace with its gardens are a major tourist attraction.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Palace ===\n\nThe original palace was commissioned by Sophie Charlotte, the wife of Friedrich I, Elector of Brandenburg in what was then the village of Lietzow. Named Lietzenburg, the palace was designed by Johann Arnold Nering in baroque style. It consisted of one wing and was built in \u200b2 1\u20442 storeys with a central cupola. The fa\u00e7ade was decorated with Corinthian pilasters. On the top was a cornice on which were statues. At the rear in the centre of the palace were two oval halls, the upper one being a ceremonial hall and the lower giving access to the gardens. Nering died during the construction of the palace and the work was completed by Martin Gr\u00fcnberg and Andreas Schl\u00fcter. The inauguration of the palace was celebrated on 11 July 1699, Frederick's 42nd birthday.Friedrich crowned himself as King Friedrich I in Prussia in 1701 (Friedrich II, known as Frederick the Great, would later achieve the title King of Prussia). Two years previously, he had appointed Johann Friedrich von Eosander (also known as Eosander von G\u00f6the) as the royal architect and sent him to study architectural developments in Italy and France, particularly the Palace of Versailles. On his return in 1702, Eosander began to extend the palace, starting with two side wings to enclose a large courtyard, and the main palace was extended on both sides. Sophie Charlotte died in 1705 and Friedrich named the palace and its estate Charlottenburg in her memory. In the following years, the Orangery was built on the west of the palace and the central area was extended with a large domed tower and a larger vestibule. On top of the dome is a wind vane in the form of a gilded statue representing Fortune designed by Andreas Heidt. The Orangery was originally used to overwinter rare plants. During the summer months, when over 500 orange, citrus and sour orange trees decorated the baroque garden, the Orangery regularly was the gorgeous scene of courtly festivities.\n\nVarious artists were invited to decorate the interior of the palace.  As the court painter of Friedrich I, the Flemish artist Jan Anthonie Coxie was commissioned to paint the walls and ceilings in various rooms of the palace. Coxie painted between 1701 and 1713 frescos and an altarpiece in the Palace Chapel and frescos in the Gobelin Gallery and Porcelain Room.  The frescos in the Porcelain Room were blatant propaganda for the glorious rule of Friedrich I.  They represent Aurora, the Goddess of Dawn, in her seven-horsed chariot chasing away Night and clearing the way for the Sun-God Apollo, who approaches in his chariot in a blaze of light. Hovering overhead, Mercury heralds the arrival of the life-giving god and Saturn ushers in the Golden Age with his scythe.  Coxie also included images of the Four Continents as well as the Four Seasons, which are familiar allusions to political power and thus affirm the greatness of Friedrich I.Inside the palace, was a room described as \"the eighth wonder of the world\", the Amber Room (Bernsteinzimmer), a room with its walls surfaced in decorative amber. It was designed by Andreas Schl\u00fcter, and its construction by the Danish amber craftsman Gottfried Wolfram started in 1701. Friedrich Wilhelm I gave the Amber Room to Tsar Peter the Great as a present in 1716.\n\nWhen Friedrich I died in 1713, he was succeeded by his son, Friedrich Wilhelm I whose building plans were less ambitious, although he did ensure that the building was properly maintained. Building was resumed after his son Friedrich II (Frederick the Great) came to the throne in 1740. During that year, stables for his personal guard regiment were completed to the south of the Orangery wing and work was started on the east wing. The building of the new wing was supervised by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff, the superintendent of all the Royal Palaces, who largely followed Eosander's design. The decoration of the exterior was relatively simple but the interior furnishings were rich with painting and sculpture, textiles, and mirrors. The ground floor was intended for Frederick's wife Elisabeth Christine, who, preferring Sch\u00f6nhausen Palace however, was only an occasional visitor. The especially splendid decoration of the upper floor, which included the White Hall, the Banqueting Hall, the Throne Room and the Golden Gallery, was designed mainly by Johann August Nahl. In 1747, a second apartment for the king was prepared in the distant eastern part of the wing. During this time, Sanssouci was being built at Potsdam, and once this was completed Frederick was only an occasional visitor to Charlottenburg.In 1786, Frederick was succeeded by his nephew Friedrich Wilhelm II, who transformed five rooms on the ground floor of the east wing into his summer quarters and part of the upper floor into Winter Chambers, although he did not live long enough to use them. His son, Friedrich Wilhelm III, came to the throne in 1797 and reigned with his wife, Queen Luise, for 43 years. They spent much of this time living in the east wing of Charlottenburg. In 1804, following Prussia's defeat at Jena-Auerstedt, Napoleon marched into Berlin and settled in the palace, which became his headquarters.  Their eldest son, Friedrich Wilhelm IV, who reigned from 1840 to 1861, lived in the upper storey of the central palace building. After Friedrich Wilhelm IV died, the only other royal resident of the palace was Friedrich III, who reigned for 99 days in 1888.The palace was badly damaged in 1943 during the Second World War. In 1951, the war-damaged Stadtschloss in East Berlin was demolished and, as the damage to Charlottenburg was at least as serious, it was feared that it would also be demolished. However, following the efforts of Margarete K\u00fchn, the director of the State Palaces and Gardens, it was rebuilt to its former condition, with gigantic modern ceiling paintings by Hann Trier. From 2004 till early 2006, Charlottenburg Palace was the seat of the President of Germany, whilst Schloss Bellevue was being renovated.\n\n\n=== Grounds ===\n\nThe garden was designed in 1697 in Baroque style by Simeon Godeau, who had been influenced by Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre, designer of the gardens at Versailles. Godeau's design consisted of geometric patterns, with avenues and moats, which separated the garden from its natural surroundings. Beyond the formal gardens was the Carp Pond. Towards the end of the 18th century, a less formal, more natural-looking garden design became fashionable. In 1787 the Royal Gardener Georg Steiner redesigned the garden in the English landscape style for Friedrich Wilhelm II, the work being directed by Peter Joseph Lenn\u00e9. After the Second World War, the centre of the garden was restored to its previous baroque style.In 1788, Friedrich Wilhelm II arranged for the building of the Belvedere, designed by Carl Gotthard Langhans, in the grounds beyond the Carp Pond. The building was used as a teahouse and as a viewing-tower. Langhans also designed the Palace Theatre, which was built between 1788 and 1791 to the west of the Orangery wing. The Mausoleum was built as a tomb for Queen Luise between 1810 and 1812 in neoclassical style to a design by Heinrich Gentz. After the death of Friedrich Wilhelm III, it was extended; this design being by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. It was extended again in 1890\u201391 by Albert Geyer to accommodate the graves of Wilhelm I and his wife Augusta. In 1825, Friedrich Wilhelm III added the Neuer Pavilion, an Italianate villa designed by Schinkel, to the north of the palace. This was damaged in the war in 1943 and was reconstructed between 1957 and 1970.\n\n\n=== Burials ===\nLouise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz\nFrederick William III of Prussia\nWilhelm I, German Emperor\nPrince Albert of Prussia (1809\u20131872)\nAugusta of Saxe-Weimar\n\n\n== Today ==\n\nThe palace and grounds are a major visitor attraction.\n\nFor an admission charge, parts of the interior of the palace are open to visitors, including the Old Palace (Alte Schloss) and the New Wing (Neuer Fl\u00fcgel). The Old Palace contains many rooms with baroque decoration, and includes a room called the Porcelain Cabinet, which holds thousands of porcelain objects. On special display are the crown jewels and the royal silver and fine porcelain tableware. The New Wing includes the opulent rococo State Apartments of Frederick the Great and the more modest Winter Chambers of Friedrich Wilhelm II. The formal and informal gardens are freely open to the public.\nFor an admission charge, the Mausoleum, the Belvedere and the Neue Pavilion are open to visitors. The Mausoleum contains the graves of, and memorials to, members of the Hohenzollern family. The memorial to Queen Luise includes her reclining effigy, which is made from Carrara marble and was designed by Christian Daniel Rauch.\nAlso open to the public are the Belvedere, which contains a collection of Berlin porcelain, and the Neue Pavilion, which houses a collection of arts and crafts of the period when Schinkel was active.\nThe former Orangery houses a restaurant and caf\u00e9. Destroyed during World War II, the Great Orangery was reconstructed on the model of the baroque building. Today, it shines in its old brilliance again. The light-flooded festival room provides a pleasant framework for cultural events, concerts and banquets.\nIn addition, a large equestrian statue of Friedrich Wilhelm I is the focus of the palace courtyard. This was designed by Andreas Schl\u00fcter and made between 1696 and 1700. From 1703, it stood on the Langen Br\u00fccke (now the Rathausbr\u00fccke) but was moved to a place of safety in the Second World War. On its return after the war, the barge carrying it sank and it was not salvaged until 1949. In 1952, it was erected on its present site. Across the street of the palace are two more museums, the Br\u00f6han Museum, which contains art nouveau and art deco articles, and the Berggruen Museum, which houses modern art, in particular works by Picasso and Klee.On the left is the Scharf-Gerstenberg Collection.  Its collection of paintings, graphics and sculptures, spanning the period from French Romanticism to Surrealism.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Baroque residences\nList of castles in Berlin and Brandenburg\nPalaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nHertzsch, Raimund (1998).

          "Very pretty to look at, even though it\u2019s a bit out of the way from central Berlin. There is a big park behind the palace so it\u2019s great to just walk around and chill. Do yourself a favor and use some insect repellent tho.",
          "This is a beautiful palace and amazing park, the park is not so well known, and you have enough space to work out and go jogging, I totally recommend if you are living close to here for chilling. \n\nEven for tourist, you can come here and \u2026",
          "Really enjoyed, awesome staff too! We actually missed our timeslot for the alteschloss, as we were waiting outside the new palace thinking it was the same thing, but it was fine they let us go through. Place is magnificent, well worth seeing with your own eyes because you can't take pictures inside (but not everywhere).",

          "Fantastic gardens that are free to visit and huge, the Palace itself is full of interesting works of art and has a rich history on display. Although most of the Palace was damaged in fires and the war the reproductions really give you an idea of what it was like when the occupants still used it.",

Would recommend the self tour as the \"full\" tour was a bit painful after the first 20 minutes of listening to a lot of details that could be summed up more quickly with the audio tour.  Worth the stop and plan to spend a couple hours to see the full grounds.",
          "Gorgeous baroque palace, with baroque and rococo interiors. This is one of the few remaining locations in Berlin where one can see the Prussian part of Berlin's history. The interiors are gorgeous, and I believe tours are offered but not \u2026",

          "It is crazy that such a Palace is 20 minutes from the heart of Berlin. The tour inside isn't anything special but still worth it. Definitely walk the park though in the back!",
          "One of the most beautiful Christmas markets in Berlin. Also wonderful to take a tour of the palace any other time of the year. It\u2019s usually not very busy and has some extravagant rooms. There\u2019s a beautiful garden that\u2019s open and free to the \u2026",

          "I went there with my grandmother who has trouble walking, they made us hurry to leave and walk very fast because they had to close in 10 minutes. It's really a shame such a great lack of compassion, they saw that she had a cane and therefore couldn't hurry... next time refuse the elderly at the entrance, it will be faster.",
          "The best Christmas market in Berlin! It's very nice with lot of food/drinks and souvenirs. However on Sunday afternoon (+/-16.00h), it was extremely crowded. I would recommend you to go on another day/time.",

          "On my very first visit to this place I was very impressed at \u20ac12 to go round the old part of the building was well worth the money and I very much enjoyed it and this is not usually my thing I would recommend",

          "I wasn't inside of that Palace, but I and my wife walked around it and it's garden, so I think I can write some kind of review on it.\nA very long palace with beautiful architecture and several sculptures around. a relatively large park \u2026",
          "The Old Palace (central building) contains beautiful rooms especially the Porcelain room/cabinet, as well as the Staterooms of Friedrich I, and the Chapel should not be missed.",
          "Great attraction with tons of information thanks to the very detailed audio guides. Maybe too detailed!! If you feel overwhelmed, just skip a couple rooms and keep going!",
          "I've only been in the front gardens but it was really nice and a must see with Christmas",
          "Christmas Market @ Charlottenburger Schlo\u00df. For me one of the best Xmas markets in Berlin. Even with a platform to make better photos. No entrance fee 2019.",
          "One of the hotspot in the city. Must see! Great walk in the neighborhood and in amazing park! The park is open from 8am till dark. The palace have tour option.",
          "The palace itself was very pretty and well worth a visit, but the people working in each of the rooms were terrible! Excessively stern and hovering to ensure you didn\u2019t step out of line. It definitely impacted our enjoyment of the place.",
          "Such a beautiful vintage building. The architecture is just amazing",
          "Really interesting Place. I suggest the visit.",
          "Great castle. It's huge and the well maintained garden is open to the public for free. A lot of open area which is nice and also a good amount of trees and other objects which provide shadows. Pretty nice located, there a ice cream shop around and a supermarket not too far.",

          "Beautiful palace grounds, definitely well worth a visit if you're in Berlin. There is a self guiding audio tour that takes you to all of the beautiful rooms in the palace and you learn what used to happen there. Great for learning about the \u2026",
          "Visited while christmas market was on, the lighting and I was a very pleasant experience. Did not visit inside. Recommend to stop by if uou are around.",
          "Wonderful history, about half the buildings are as history left them, the rest has been lovelingly restored after allied bombing in ww2. Those parts restored are used house art and antiques when they could not be fully restored. Result is a great place to visit. Audio guides are good, staff very helpful.",
          "It looks nice from the outside. We didn't go in because the queue was long and we didn't have a lot of time.",
          "When you hear  the word Castle you expect much more than that. The park and everything behind the castle was really great, but the castle itself is just So regular, the architecture doesn't even make u smile not like wonder. It's like a simple big house",
          "Christmas market it fabulous. Inside and outside vendors. Lovely views. X",
          "Very beautiful but if you don't buy the audiobook it is useless",
          "Gorgeous gardens in a slightly out-of-the-way part of the city - well worth stopping off if you\u2019re cycling that way. Stop and watch the wildlife - there was a fox wandering around in the middle of the afternoon without seeming bothered by all the people around - amazing \ud83d\ude0e",
          "Beautiful Christmas market with loads of stools for drinks food and buying presents. This is my favorite Christmas market",

          "Would totally recommend the Christmas market, magical and loads of lovely little unique items, plus yummy food and drink.",
          "One thousand years of history explained! 1075 to 1989, all the wars, more wars and shifting borders. From the Hohensollerans to Napoleon to Kaiser Wilhelm II to Gorbachev. If Rome had the Mediterranean, Prussia had the Baltic. Fabulous.",
          "What a beautiful place. I highly recommend the stroll through its gardens. You can even see sheeps  there. Take your family there and have a lovely afternoon.",
          "Great garden, super for family walks",
          "Well worth a visit. Mostly reconstructed post WW2 it is still a spectacular structure. An excellent audio tour is included in the entry fee and greatly enhances the experience. Beautiful grounds lead to a mausoleum. The recently opened new wing had a very different feel to the older part and is a good addition to the tour.",
          "The Christmas market here was really pretty and the palace looked lovely lit up at night. Worth visiting for a look around for sure!",
          "It was too much mesmerizing; there were too many food stalls, there was rush as well, people playing music was also good.",
          "It's the place with great history . Which bring in front of you how the civilisations has survived and struggled to improve the life's of human beings. Great place to visst if you want to understand the culture and history",
          "Was there when there was the Christmas market. The Schloss looked absolutely stunning when the light illuminated over it.",
          "Definitely worth a visit if you are looking for something historical.  The self-guided tour has an audio guide that is very informative (if somewhat difficult to use).  You can only see a relatively small part of the palace, but that is probably typical of most similar places.  You can learn quite a bit about Prussia.",
          "Very beautiful palace in Charlotteburg.  A must visit location in Berlin.  Large space with large gardens all around with a lake at the edge of the palace.  Beautiful fountains and walkways.  A mausoleum in the middle and nature all around.  It is worth while to go inside the palace as well by buying a ticket.",
          "Half of the castle is in maintenance with the same price of 12\u20ac :(",

          "Great Christmas market. Probably the best one in Berlin.",
          "Beautiful palace! They hold small concerts with performances by the resident Berliner orchestra in the palace that you can buy tickets to (can add a three-course dinner beforehand too). Highly recommended for loves of classical music!",

          "We had a timed ticket bought online to visit but were allowed in earlier as it wasn't busy. It's a really beautiful place and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because you weren't allowed to take any photos so it would have cost a \u2026",
          "Beautiful any time of the year. Well kept gardens, wooded paths. Lovely to walk along the river to the mini Bellevue. All sorts of wildlife. Foxes, squirrels, swans,  grey Herron. Popular for dog walkers and joggers.",

          "Beautiful palace and we were lucky enough to go when the Christmas market was happening.",
          "Nice place for family picnic. Lot of fresh air and small animals. Rabbits, fox, hedgehogs...",
          "One of my favorite spots in the city.\nThe Palace kept it's original building and Garten / Park. The building is used as an art gallery and they hold exhibitions. You can also take a tour inside.\n\nThe Garten is very nice and well maintained, \u2026",
          "Beautiful, amazing history and nice preservation of history. Loved it.",
          "Probably the most beautiful place in Berl\u00edn at least in the summer. Awesome Architecture, nice place and great gardens. A perfect place to spend a morning or afternoon reading peacefully",
          "Nice royal palace of Hohenzollern family especially Friedrich the great",
          "Beautiful palace! They sometimes have concerts in the evenings. Musicians dress up like people in the 17th century. They were playing Mozart the night I went. If you close your eyes or ignore the modern dresses of the other audience, you \u2026",
          "I loved our visit to this palace! We chose the New Wing tour only plus visited the gardens. The ballrooms in the new wing are a MUST. The audio guide was also very informative. It\u2019s a must see if you\u2019re in Berlin!",
          "It's a wonderful time to visit this place in Christmas.",
          "Visited the Christmas market here. Not bad but wasn't my favorite market.",
          "A beautiful palace with beautiful gardens\nI loved touring it from inside where you can get a glimpse of how the royals used to live",
          "We went to the old Baroque part of the building! The audio guide is very good and easy to use and allows for you to go at your own pace. Cost us \u20ac12 I think and if we paid a bit extra we could have seen the new part of the palace which is \u2026",
          "A very Grand Palace! Building started in the 17th century so well worth seeing it if you're into architecture and history.\nThe gardens round the back are rather large. The area by the ponds and dam is pretty well kept and the forests are \u2026",
          "Wonderful garden and grounds. Excellent English self guided tours. Very affordable.",
          "Nice place to visit. 12\u20ac entrance",
          "Nice palace. But Potsdam parks are much better maintained",

          "Impressive palace! The inside palace is very beautiful and worth the visit. If you have time buy the ticket to see all 5 attractions of the castle (including the new palace and the old palace) for \u20ac 17,00. Also, if you don't want to spend money a simple walk in the castle gardens is worth the visit.",
          "Very beautiful, especially in the sun shine. Definitely get the audio guide as it brings the inside of the palace to life.  The staff were also lovely!\n\nThe gardens are fantastic and they are free (excluding the various small outer buildings)",
          "A huge garden in front of the palace. There is an option to take 17 Euro ticket for both old and new palace. I personally felt it's worth it. There are some very amazing paintings inside the palace. Have to pay extra 3 euros for clicking pictures. it takes around 3 hours so plan accordingly.",
          "A little disappointing, in my book. While a few of the public rooms were very ornate and the paintings were very nice, most of the building was badly damaged during WW2 and they admit that much of the decoration and choices are guesswork. \u2026",
          "Beautiful Palace..not too crowded.. Nice audio guide.. Garden and the second apartment can be skipped..",
          "Clean and wel maintained. Free to see outside compound. Ticket adult Eu12. Good enough for photo taking",

          "The christmas market was fantastic,colourful and full of attractions",
          "Wonderful experience. Great place to see the opulence and decor or the baroque style. Lots of porcelain! Interesting furniture. Most of the paintings, and the installations, are dedicated to the history of the ruling families of Brandenburg and Prussia.",

          "Grounds could have been better kept. Building beautiful. Did not go inside",
          "If your like a bit of history & old paintings then you'll love this place. Garden was a lot smaller than I expected. Be warned though, if you want to take photos inside you have to pay!",
          "Beautiful building and gardens.",
          "The Palace looks very empty, so you don't get a feeling that you are inside a real palace. .  Looks more like an art museum than a palace.",
          "very nice !",
          "Great spot for a Christmas market. Loved the way all the stands were put up. Plenty of choices for merchandise and food. Prices are comparable to the rest of Berlin. The overall feel is great, especially as you have the Palace as a backdrop. Would definitely return here next year.",
          "A nice place to see and having morning walk inside the palace ground. Beautiful slush with swans and ducks swimming.",
          "Great audioguide and not too busy! It was a very wet day when we visited, so whilst we would have loved to explore the gardens we opted not to. Luckily there was enough to see inside that we didn't feel like we missed out. I especially \u2026",

          "Great history. Nice half day visit",
          "1. If you can print your ticket, then do so. However, they were very understanding of our none printed mobile versions that didn't work very well with their system. \n\n2. It's been very well renovated after the fire damage in the war. \n\n3. \u2026",
          "Amazing hotel, coffee and croissant in the breakfast.",
          "As a tourist  it was  very  interesting to  visit.  But  to divide  the  place  up into  sections  and  charge accordingly  is a bit  rough.  To much.",
          "Perfect place to visit now with the Christmas market.",
          "Schloss Charlottenburg as the largest palace and the only surviving royal residence in Berlin. It is rarely can see what a historical and beautiful palace could found in the modern day of Berline. Because of this, Charlottenburg Palace is \u2026",
          "Very beautiful place they recreated most of it which is very impressive very recommended while in berlin!",
          "The Charlottenburg Palace is located about 500 metres north-east of the Westend Station.  \n\nThe architecture of the palace is in Baroque style and the grounds are magnificently manicured.",
          "We did not enter the palace, instead opted to bike the gardens. The majority of the gardens are more of a natural park with biking and waking paths rather than neatly manicured bushes and fountains. Point being, don't expect Versailles. Also, as a city with many lovely parks and green spaces, this one didn't particularly stand out.",
          "Good place to know architecture of colonial era. It has got some Park area which is good for sunny days.",
          "A castle well maintained, it's worth it!\nThe photo is a room of the new Pavillion.",

          "Magnificent monument of rich German history",

          "Wonderful place to visit! Amazing place with beautiful park.\n\nHaving a walk around was so peaceful and relaxing. The park is very quiet, sitting near the lake is one of the most romantical things I had in Berlin.",
          "The Palace & gardens are lovely to spend a few hours wondering around. If you go into the palace; request the audio guide which is included in the ticket price as the information is really helpful. I would recommend visiting on a sunny day so you can really appreciate the gardens.",
          "The palace interior is beautiful and historically interesting, so well worth a visit. Although it is mainly reconstructions from the 20th century following the destruction of the war, which may be a problem for some people. The gardens are not huge, and are mainly laid out as parks rather than formal gardens.",

          "Beautiful palace with a lot to see and a lot of history. Quite expensive if you want to do all the tours though.",
          "Beautiful Palace. A little out of Berlin but worth visiting. Would recommend seeing it at night.",

          "The place is well  lit and the  clean..",

          "Very beautiful and historically place to visit in Berlin.",

          "Very impressive park landscape behind the palace. Couldn't get into the palace itself because it's closed on Mondays",
          "Interesting place to visit. Take the audio guide it gives lots of information. It was a little cold and damp in the gardens but still worth a walk through",
          "Okay but nothing like the English or French palaces",
          "The nicest part is the garden. Go there and have a walk. It's also nice in the inside but the sad part is that most of the rooms are a \"remake\". No offense of course but I felt sad. That's because of the war obviously.",
          "The Chinese pottery and porcelain collections in the old palace is amazing.",

          "Beautiful! Went there once for the X-mas Market and I loved it. It was really beautiful to see, also with the lights",
          "This place is so awesome. I love to go here. From S- Bahn Westend you can take Bus or just take a walk 3 halte / bus stop from S Bahn. Better you visit at morning or afternoon because thats will be best lighting to take a picture.",
          "What a beautiful place to be! And the park is big and beautiful",
          "The audio guide was very helpful however it could perhaps go a bit faster or just cut down on the information. I learnt many things going there that's why I reviewed it well. I would recommend it. Very good.",
          "A historical gem amongst the modern buildings of the rest of the city. Good value for money too. Going in I was worried that my limited knowledge of the German royal family might hamper my experience, but this wasn't an issue thanks to \u2026",

          "A lot of history of Prussia and it's royal family is preserved here. It gives you a snapshot of a different type of life. \nThe building is nicely restored, students get a discount, and the audioguide is nice. However, it takes a lot of time to explore it all.",
          "Enjoyed touring through the palace.  Extremely interesting and very well maintained.  Learned a great deal about the royal family and how Potsdam was the center of the Prussian empire.  I was not aware of the historical significance of Potsdam.  Truly a learning experience.",

          "Nice to visit. We didn't do the audio guides, so I liked the small paragraph in each room to read.  I loved the floors of so many rooms.  It was smaller than expected. The mausoleum was a walk and very tiny. Didn't bother going to Bellevue \u2026",
          "Visited the Charlottenburg Palace for the dinner and concert package and it did not disappoint! Our meal was delicious and was served by folks dressed in traditional clothing from the Baroque period. Even the meal reflects that time! The \u2026",

          "Amazing place for German history.",
          "First I\u2019d like to start by saying that the castle itself is an amazing structure. Having visited many European castles I can see the relation between being royal and the need to represent oneself and one\u2019s country in the best possible \u2026",

          "I came out here on a push bike from Kreuzburg riding along the canals. It was a beautiful 40 minute cycle. On arrival I sat out front of the palace and enjoyed some lunch. I then cycles through the beautiful gardens behind the palace. Some of the paths in the park do not allow bikes, however this isn't well signed.",

          "Huge palace with amazing rooms!",
          "Very interesting place with very good audio tours. Book ahead on line for your time slot into the palace. Note that the mausoleum and belvedere are closed Oct to March. The history covered and the time span is very well described and presented.",
          "Magnificent palace to visit. Well worth the \u20ac10 to get the self guided audio tour of the new palace.\n\nThere was a Christmas market right outside the palace as well. But did not get the chance to walk around too much.",

          "Nice gardens but that's about it",
          "Old palace was nice, not as grand and complicated as for example schloss in Dresden, but still beautifull. Can not comment on new wing as i was not there. Garden is nice and extremely large, but again not as grand as some others, like at Czech castle Lednice",

          "TO DIE FOR - It does not get any more ornamental than this....",
          "With a ticket you can visit the interiors which is quite nice with a free audio guide. The staff is not the most polite though. Carrying a camera requires a different photography ticket. The outer section of the palace also is very spacious and has a nice garden, pond and a walking trail with good views of the palace.",
          "The price was reasonable and the free audioguide was very informative! The gardens are beautiful and the ghost of Sophie Charlotte can swim an impressive amount of laps around the lake.",
          "A recreation of the palace that has been under construction or reconstruction for most of its long life. Beautiful building with impressive gardens to the rear but weeds and waste ground to the front of the 'new' wing. Worth the visit but \u2026",
          "A big and amazing palace, renewed after WWII but the furniture, paintings and others are original. Many famous paintings are hanging in this museum including my favourite, Napoleon crossing the Alps.\nIt will take more than 5 hours to see all places and admire the art so I recomend mark the whole morning in your calendar for it.",

          "I came to Berlin during a very cold and freezing winter with yelper Sigourney W. and we decided to check out Schloss Charlottenburg because we didn't want to trek out to Potsdam.  Well, it was slightly disappointing because a lot of the \u2026",

          "Beautiful and historic palace within easy reach of central Berlin.",
          "The palace is beautiful and the garden amazing too. But inside you get to see not really much for 12 euro which is not small amount. And also you have to pay 3 more euro to be able to take pictures. I\u2019ve been in palaces that I was able to see way more for less.",
          "Beautiful place and a must visit if you enjoy wandering around stately homes. The audio guides are very good and full of information. Highly recommended.",
          "It's a beautiful palace with a great history behind it. You can have an audio visit in French, English, Dutch, Spanish and few other languages. The place is beautiful, yet disappointing. We couldn't see even half of the palace and the visit \u2026",
          "A really impressive castle, which tells a tale of 400 years. The changes over the years, its impressive growth and its centering of power is worth the short ride from the city center.\n\nOne drawback, however, was the lack of a cafe at the \u2026",
          "I got all included ticket, 17\u20ac. But i could find two places were closed by the map later.  I asked the staff in a reception. He just said during winter they are closed without any explanation. It was like it is natural thing that we should \u2026",

          "Awesome experience! Just cannot afford to miss this when you visit Berlin. Do not miss the tour of the palace.",
          "Historically very interesting but very poor compared to Potsdam castles or the other european royal residencies. The worst part have been the security staff, rude and absolutely not ready to answer the simplest question ( leave out the fact \u2026",
          "Grounds are fantastic, palace interior not worth visiting for my family.",
          "You take an audio tour of the inside of the Palace, which is straight forward enough. Its takes around 40mins to the tour. You can walk around the gardens for free. I bought an online ticket for 17 euros, which entitled me to the tour and entrance to muselom and Belvedere Palace. A nice way to spend a couple of hours",
          "Fantastic Palace. Truly a must see!",
          "There are two sections to the palace, the old palace and the new wing. It is necessary to exit the building to go from.one section to the other.\n The interiors of the palace are amazing and the audioguides has just enough details to engage you\n  You can take photos for a 3\u20ac fee",

          "Really well presented pice of German history. Buy a Charlottenburg + ticket and get access to all the buildings. Also the 3\u20ac photo permission is well worth it. Nice park around to relax. Wasn't that busy on a Saturday. Definitely worth a visit.",

        "wiki": "Villa Sch\u00f6ningen is a historic residence in the Potsdam district of suburban Berlin, at Berliner Strasse 86, located at the corner of Berlin Street and Swan Avenue, just west of the Glienicke Bridge.\nSince 1977, villa Sch\u00f6ningen has been included in the Heritage List of the State of Brandenburg, and since 1996 it has been part of the Berlin-Potsdam's UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\n\n== von Sch\u00f6ning ==\nOn behalf of the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm IV, in 1843 Ludwig Persius designed this house in the Italian Villa style for Kurd von Sch\u00f6ning (1789-1859), the chamberlain of Prince Carl of Prussia. The villa was named after Schoeningen, an East Brunswick city, that was the historical origin of the Sch\u00f6ning family.\nThe property faced Prince Carl's Glienicke Castle across a bridge.  The construction of the villa was facilitated by the Prince both to remove an eyesore, and assist a close friend.\nAfter the death of von Sch\u00f6ning in 1859, the house was sold by his children to Prince Carl, who then resold it to a court council.  Moritz Jacoby bought the villa in 1871 and passed it on to his daughter Anna and her husband Hermann Wallich when he died six years later.\n\n\n== Wallich Family ==\nAnna and Hermann Wallich seldom used the house, but Hermann's eldest son Paul was fond of it.  After returning from a banking apprentiship in the United States, Paul acquired the property in 1913.  Together, Paul and his wife Hildegard  raised their three children, Henry, Walter, and Cristel in the villa. At the onset of the Holocaust, Hildegard and her children escaped Germany and survived in the UK. Paul, unable to cope with the political development, stayed in Germany and committed suicide on November 11, 1938.\n\n\n== Museum ==\nIn November 2009, a historical museum opened in the Villa Sch\u00f6ningen on the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. It was founded by CEO of Axel springer Mathias D\u00f6pfner and the CEO of RHJI Leonhard Fisher as a privately funded project.  The museum was opened by Chancellor Angela Merkel with former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev also in attendance.\nThe museum will tell the story of the Glienicke Bridge, which from 1949 to 1989 was famous as the Bridge of Spies as it was used for exchanging captured agents between the Soviet bloc and the free West.\nA video installation by Stefan Roloff is part of the mansion's permanent exhibition.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe House at the Bridge: A Story of Modern Germany (Scribner, 1995) ISBN 0-684-19400-7\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVilla Sch\u00f6ningen - official site\nPermanent exhibition, Villa Sch\u00f6ningen: \"Leben im Todesstreifen\".\nMemory of Paul Wallich: \"Stolperstein\".",

        "wiki": "The Brandenburg Gate (German: Brandenburger Tor) on the Luisenplatz in Potsdam, not to be confused with the gate of the same name on Berlin's Pariser Platz, was built in 1770\u201371 by Carl von Gontard and Georg Christian Unger by order of Frederick II of Prussia. It stands at the western end of Brandenburger Stra\u00dfe, which runs in a straight line up to the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul.\nPreviously, from 1733, there was another, simpler gate on the same spot, which resembled a castle gateway. Together with the city wall, a form of toll or excise barrier, and the other gates it was intended to prevent desertion and smuggling.\nTowards the end of the Seven Years' War, Frederick the Great had the old gate demolished and built, in its stead, this new Brandenburg Gate, as a symbol of his victory. For that reason the Brandenburg Gate resembles a Roman triumphal arch. Its prototype was the Arch of Constantine in Rome. The Roman influence of its architectural style can be seen, for example, in the double columns of Corinthian order as well as the design of the attic.\nA feature of the Brandenburg Gate is that it has two completely different sides, designed by two architects. Carl von Gontard designed the city side, his pupil, Georg Christian Unger, the field or countryside-facing side. Gontard made the city side as a rendered facade with Corinthian-style lesenes and trophies, Unger designed the field site in the style of the Arch of Constantine with Corinthian double-columns and ornamentation like the golden trumpets. The two side entrances for pedestrians were not added until 1843, under Frederick William IV, in order to cope with the increase in pedestrian traffic.\nAt that time people had to pass the Brandenburg Gate if they wanted to make their way to the town of Brandenburg, hence the name. The gate leads walkers into the city centre pedestrian zone of Brandenburger Stra\u00dfe in an easterly direction up to priory church of St. Peter and St. Paul.\nSince the city wall was demolished around 1900 the Brandenburg Gate has been a free-standing structure.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nPaul Sigel, Silke D\u00e4hmlow, Frank Seehausen und Lucas Elmenhorst, Architekturf\u00fchrer Potsdam, Dietrich Reimer Verlag, Berlin 2006, ISBN 3-496-01325-7.\n\n\n== External links ==",
        "brit": "Brandenburg Gate, German Brandenburger Tor,  the only remaining town gate of Berlin, Germany, standing at the western end of the avenue Unter den Linden. It has served as a symbol of both the division of Germany and the country\u2019s reunification and is one of Berlin\u2019s most-visited landmarks.The Brandenburg Gate, Berlin.\u00a9 Helga Lade/Peter Arnold, Inc.Brandenburg Gate (left), Berlin.\u00a9 Senat Berlin/Press and Information Office of the Federal Government of GermanyThe gate was commissioned by Frederick William II as an entrance to Unter den Linden, which led to the Prussian palace. It was built in 1788\u201391 by Carl G. Langhans after the model of the Propylaea in Athens. The sandstone structure is composed of 12 Doric columns that create five portals\u2014the middle of which was originally reserved for royal use only\u2014and stands approximately 66 feet (20 metres) high, 213 feet (65 metres) wide, and 36 feet (11 metres) deep. It is flanked by two small buildings, Haus Liebermann and Haus Sommer, which were built in the late 1990s by architect Josef Paul Kleihues to replace the pavilions that were destroyed during World War II. The gate is decorated with reliefs and sculptures designed by Gottfried Schadow, the majority of them based on the exploits of Heracles. In 1793 a quadriga statue depicting the goddess of victory bearing a symbol of peace was added. During the French occupation of Berlin (1806\u201308), Napoleon took the statue to Paris, where it remained until 1814. The gate was later used extensively in Nazi propaganda, and a parade was held there on Adolf Hitler\u2019s ascent to power in 1933. The entire structure was heavily damaged during World War II, and in 1957\u201358 it was restored, with the quadriga recast from the original molds.Brandenburg GateThe Brandenburg Gate, as seen through a barbed-wire barrier that represented the earliest version of the Berlin Wall, 1961.John Waterman\u2014Fox Photos/Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesThe Brandenburg Gate, Berlin.Skip Nall/Getty ImagesFrom 1961 to 1989 the Brandenburg Gate came to symbolize divided Germany, as the Berlin Wall shut off access to the gate for both East and West Germans. It served as the backdrop for U.S. Pres. Ronald Reagan\u2019s famous 1987 speech in which he entreated the Soviet leader, \u201cMr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\u201d The gate was reopened on December 22, 1989, in the course of the reunification of East and West Berlin, when West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl walked through it to meet East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow. It underwent restoration beginning in late 2000 and officially reopened in 2002, though it remained closed to vehicle traffic. ",

          "This gate leads to a long pedestrian shopping street full of local shops, with a church located at the other end. It\u2019s sight in its own right and a good place for a photo or two,",
          "Although I can\u2019t say that they cause special admiration, but only because I already managed to see a lot of beautiful and interesting in the country, so by themselves these gates are well made cute and interesting.",
          "Well worth a visit as is also the centre of the city and its splendid St. Nicholas Church.the brandenburg Gate is even older than the one in Berlin and the walks along the river gives a wonderful feel to the place",
          "The original, smaller than the Berlin version and super clean now. One main arch and 2 smaller side arches. Leads on to a lovely pedestrian street where even cyclists have to push their bikes!!",
          "This is the original Brandenburg Tor (Gate), which was very recently cleaned up. It's the entrance to the main shopping street in Potsdam, Brandenburger Stra\u00dfe. Again, this is a peace of history, and while the Brandenburg Tor in Berlin is bigger, this is still the original",
          "This gate is very clean and neat. It has a beautiful fountain directly in front of it, which makes for a very nice photo opportunity. It is not really the Brandenburg Gate (in Berlin) but it's a nice replica up to a point.",
          "Though the original gate is the one in Potsdam but the Berlin gate is grand and beautiful with a vista of victory tower",

          "Not THE Brandenburg gate but still very big and impressive. Nice park and shops and restaurants close by.",
          "The sculptures in the arch way is breathtaking. Worth your time to walk up to view each arch. A wonder that is was not destroyed during the world war II.",
          "Don't get your expectations too high, this is a pale comparison to the Gate in Berlin. The prettier side does not show from the open urban area, but from across the passing street on which you are cramped up close to the Gate. There are no \"good photo\" opp as pretty side is",
          "This is the smaller version of the iconic gate in Berlin. It looks rather new and has less character as compared to the one in Berlin. The surrounding is very pleasant and lots of opportunities to take nice photos.",
          "Its like a another version of the real thing in berlin. And since most things in potsdam are in walking distance of each other its worh seeing. Dont miss seeing the real one in berlin though.",
          "This Brandenburg Gate is at one end of the Brandenburger Strasse and at the other end is the St. Peter and Paul Church. Brandenburg Tor (Gate) is unassuming/small in comparison to its namesake in Berlin. However, this Potsdam Gate is actually 20 years older. The Brandenburg",
          "One of the gates of the lovely Potsdam. This monument is a big arch of historical interest, built around 1770 by order of Frederich II of Prussia, following the design of the Arch of Constantine in Rome. Interesting to have a look.",

          "Brandenburg Tor is gate that can be found accros Europe. It is much smaller then Gate in Berlin but nicely preserved. Worth seeing if nearby.",
          "This is an amazing sight and thankfully the scaffolding that was here on my last visit has now gone and you can see the gate in it\u2019s full glory.",
          "Built as a triumphal arch in the eighteenth century, the gate has a large central Roman arch flanked by a small pedestrian arch on each side. The walls of the gate are decorated by friezes while the top is decorated with beautiful sculptures. Unlike the other defensive gates,",
          "The area around the Brandenburger gate is really cosy. It\u2019s nice to walk around in this little city with all the nice cafes A trip worthy",
          "i have always recognized the Brandenburg gate with Berlin opened in 1791 and did not realize that Potsdam had its own gate.. Impressive near the shopping area completed in 1770 as a neo classical arch.making it older than its Berlin Cousin .",
          "This is still hands-down one of the most popular attractions in Berlin. The long history of this site, combined with the memorable events that occurred around it, makes it one of the places you have to say you visited. Currently under restoration, you can nevertheless get a good",
          "In September 2018, I walked past the Brandenburger Gate in Potsdam and took a photo. If you are making a daytrip to Potsdam, then your priority should be Sanssouci Park with its palaces and Cecilienhof with its World War 2 history. But afterwards, it is definitely worth",
          "Not seen covered in scaffolding. Not much more to say ....... Got to put in one hundred characters but when the place is covered in scaffolding and plastic sheets there ain\u2019t much to say.",
          "The gate stands prominently at the entrance to the pedestrian area. It is well maintained- what else can I say? It's a gate.",
          "Cannot say too much since they covered the gate making it invisible for anybody in the middle of the tourist season.",
          "Its a impressive looking gate, walking distance from the Potsdam's main attraction Sanssouci park. Next to the cafes and shopping area of the city.",
          "Worth the walk to the attraction. close to the Bundestag and the memorial for murdered Jews in the bunker, all in close proximity/",
          "While in Potsdam we planned to visit the gate but was totally hidden under covers for renovations...",
          "I was wandering across the square saying the Brandenburger gate is around here somewhere, when my partner pointed at a building completed covered in scaffolding and netting. At the time we visited there was nothing visible of the building at all.",
          "I was looking forward to seeing the detail on the Brandenburger Gate, located opposite the Luisenplatz, not that far from Sanssouci Park. It is one of 3 city gates still standing. Unlike Jager Tor and Nauener Tor with their grey brick towers attached to the city's mid 18th",
          "Big building, a lot of green and a lot of people support Germany in Fotball. I watch Germany and Sweden .. we loose :( Nice area!",

          "After the real one in Berlin ( which is not amazing either ) in my opinion, This is like a poor mans version. Still theres LOTS of more interesting places to see in and around Potsdam , So not to worry",
          "It's like a landmark at Berlin, so everyone has to go there to take a picture with it. We were on our way to the Bundestag/dome.",
          "Must visit this place in the evening. It starts buzzing with life and activity post sunset. Many options for vegan food too.",
          "When I was there the side was being renovated trough wich you could not see it clear so can say much of it.",
          "Before we visited Potsdam I was only aware of one Brandenburg Gate but this one in Potsdam was built before its better known Berlin cousin, The gate itself is smaller than the one in Berlin but is still worth checking out. It's situated in a nice area and makes for a pleasant",
          "The Potsdamer version of the Brandenburg Gate is 21 years older than it's bigger and better known brother in Berlin. Unfortunately, it was completely covered up as it is undergoing restoration.",
          "Similar to the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, it's more a ceremonial gate, setting the tone of the city. Good meeting point.",
          "2.4.18 A tiny replica of the B Gate in Berlin at Brandenburg Tor U/S Bahn Stop near the Potsdam Hauptbahnhof. This is a small area to walk around with a lot of ongoing construction. the Doctor Hit Me with some LOVE \ud83d\udc95 and a Helpful Vote!",
          "This must be another must stop/visit while in Berlin. At times it can get busy but we enjoyed our stop there. There are several things to see/do just around. This can be a quick stop.",
          "The last of the gates into Berlin, constructed in the 18th Century and still standing proud. well worth a visit when visiting Berlin and there are also a lot of other attractions in the area. Do not miss the very moving memorial to those who died trying to cross the wall to",
          "During our first visit to Potsdam (as a potential place to live) we stopped here to check out the area. Although not as grand as Berlin it was a fun place and there was a Pro European event underway which, as a British person I really enjoyed.",
          "Nothing to say much about it as a review cause its just a monument that people should visit in berlin, but what i really liked is that everybody is chill and u are allowed to shoot videos and pictures as u like nobody will be annoying even its so busy there all the time, cheers",
          ".. But there is a nearby night market when I visited that was a bigger highlight. The adjacent Brandenburg-Strausse is a little touristic but worth a look. When I visited December 2017, it was rather comically under construction/maintenance. Haha!",
          "A nice gate at a big plaza, which was most probable under preservation constractions when I visited it.",
          "When in Berlin a walk to the Brandenberg Gate is a must. It is situated in a public square where people can speak publicly to either protest or convey their ideas. The Gate is a beautiful work of art and behooves you to understand more about World War II. You can see the",
          "Potsdam has its own Brandenburger Gate . . . eat that Berlin. And it's impressive and classical and at the end of a real shopping street and by its own mall. Great touch in a quaint town.",
          "The gate according to our guide is the original Brandenburg gate. But whatever is the case, it is still iconic however smaller in scale. Unfortunately it was under renovation during our visit. But still a nice site to see.",
          "Seems to be the story of my visit You can miss this as it's on the main route to the park, smaller version of the Brandenburg gate, unfortunately scaffolding hit it from me",
          "If you made it to Potsdam, chances are you saw the other Gate in Berlin. This one is surrounded by great cafes and plazas. Worth a stop.",
          "At the end of the walking street/boulevard in Potsdam. The Brandenburg Gate is impressive although it is a smaller version of the one in Berlin. There was a music band playing and the environment was really lively.",
          "This Brandenberg Gate predates the one in Berlin by 10 years. Maybe not quite as impressive but still a very amazing monument",
          "This is an interesting area to walk around in and don't forget your selfie stick. It is one of those icons that you always see when Berlin is featured. Also, once you get here the U.S. Embassy is just inside as you walk through.",
          "The Brandenburger Gate is a small gate compared to the its big brother with the same name in Berlin. You cannot miss it on your walking tour. There is a parking garage right under it at decent prices.",
          "The area around the Gate was very lively when we visited on a Saturday afternoon, with a fun atmosphere, music playing and lots of people socialising. Plenty of food and drink available, shopping and free parking available too. Worth a visit.",

          "Not as impressive as big sister in Berlin but worth paying a visit to. Set at the end of Brandenburger Strasse a street lined with restaurants and coffee shops. Perfect area to relax. Gate design is different on each side. Fountain in square behind gate.",
          "Brandenburger Strasse that leads to the gate is a great place to wonder, have a drink and watch the world go by. So worth coming this way and seeing the gate when you are overwhelmed by gold palaces.",
          "Not as impressive as the gates in Berlin but was ok to see. A nice feature of the Brandenburg Gate is that it has two completely different sides, designed by two architects. A few cafes and shops around the gates. all very Clean, if a little dull.",
          "It is not as spectacular as its sister in Berlin, but is nevertheless a must to visit in the city. Lots of nice caf\u00e9s around it as well for lunch or cake/ ice cream!",
          "Lovely vibrant atmosphere about here and near to the embassies and other attractions like the memorial to the Jews. Very imposing archway. Please do visit.",
          "Such a great historical gate. There was a laser show on the gate at night. It's a good place for taking nemorial photos. I realy enjoy it there.",
          "While not as large or quite as decorative as it's bigger brother in Berlin, this is still a great spot to hit if you are in Potsdam. Plenty of cafe and coffee shops down the street to sit and partake in the view.",
          "The iconic symbol of Berlin! Built in 1791, and restored after the reunification of Germany, this is the only remaining structure of those which visitors once entered the city. The US Embasy is next door.",
          "Having spent a long day seeing the sights of this pleasant city, then relaxing on the square, which is a pedestrian only area, turned out to be utterly enjoyable. No cars, no fumes, no street noise, only people with strollers and children claim this area. There are shops along",
          "Not as famous as the gate in Berlin, nor anywhere near as large but nicely situated on the edge of the town centre towards the start of the park so easy to find. A nice quick photo opportunity, but if doing so try from the town side when you can get the eagle on the floor in",
          "Berlin's Brandenburg was the gateway for traffic coming from the direction of Potsdam. The converse is true for Potsdam's Brandenburg Gate. If you happen to be in that part of Potsdam, you should take a look.",
          "Brandenburg Gate in Potsdam is the little - and in my eyes more beautiful - sibbling of the one in Berlin. You will inevitably pass by it on your way from Potsdam city centre/train station to Sanssouci castle. There are some nice caf\u00e9s in the vicinity.",
          "A really wonderful sense of history, on a really hot day the fountain in the centre is very appealing! At the end of the Brandenburger Strasse it is a real focus point. There are many different restaurants around this area where you can get a full meal or just a snack, all",
          "Imagine the history of this gate and leaders kings who moved thru this gate - what a beauty and what a gate :) a small similar gate is in Paris too",

          "A mini version of its big brother in Berlin one of many histrionic building's and sights around Potsdam.",
          "Standing in the gate and realizing it was part of the dividing wall of east and west Germany was thought provoking...especially with all the discussion about building a new wall in the USA",
          "It's basically just a big gate. Not a lot to say. There is no ticket fees or lines. Very simple tourist destination.",
          "Please note that this is the Brandenburger Gate in Potsdam, NOT the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. Mini version of it's better known 'brother' in Berlin. Interesting to look at for a few minutes before walking along the main street in Potsdam.",
          "This is the symbol of a free Europe in many ways. Stuck behind the wall in the Death Zone for decades, it is the place that sums up the momentous events the brought the wall down.",
          "The little sister of the gate in Berlin. I did not find it exceptional but it is well preserved and worth having a look when in town.",
          "Visited a few times, night time is best in my opinion, an iconic Berlin monument, a must see on any trip",
          "The gate is located at the entrance to the Old Town part of Potsdam. It is definitely worth going to see and there are lots of cafes nearby where you can sit and appreciate the structure on a pleasant day",
          "I was excited to get to see the historic Brandenburg gate. It is beautiful, and all the little shops and caf\u00e9s around it are really great! Don't miss this landmark!!",
          "This area has wonderful architecture and plenty of shops and restaurant nearby. To get there take the 91 tram from Central Station.",
          "On a cold winter morning, the glow of the stone when the sunlight hit it made this gate all the more beautiful. It stands alone, untouched by the passage of time around it. Enjoy!",
          "Although this one is not as impressive and big as the one located in Berlin, it has to be noted that this one is the original, the real gateway to the l\u00e4nder of Brandenbug.",
          "The gate is at the end of a fine pedestrian walk in Old Town. The walk is a great stroll, lined with stores and cafes. It was busy but not with foreign tourists.",
          "This gate is nice and marks the start of the old town. The centre of the old town is worth wandering around.",
          "The gate was nice to see. It's in a lovely area to walk around and enjoy the cafe/restaurants and good for shopping.",
          "The Brandenburger Gate, is a very imposing sight when you first see it - there is on the top of the gate, a chariot with four horses and a charioteer.. We went on the City Tour bus, which stopped at the gate for about twenty minutes - if you are in Berlin - this a must to",
          "Quite interesting to walk up to and see but a political rally was on at the same time so was crowded and full of graphic pictures. A beautiful place though and very thought provoking",
          "It goes without saying that, when you visit Berlin, you MUST visit the Brandenburger Tor. It's one of the most iconic landmarks in the city and, for historians, an apt symbol for the Cold War itself. That said, it's a pretty quick stop after the Reichstag, a walk in Tiergarten",
          "No tour of Berlin would be complete without visiting the Brandenburg Gate! Much more than just the symbol of a reunified Germany, it has many more stories to tell. Get there early to have the chance to get (relatively) tourist free photos.",
          "The main city gate is magnificent architectural structure. It is next to excellent shopping and restaurants.",
          "It's small compared to Branderburg Gate in Berlin but quite nice. Built as a victory symbol after the Seven Years' War. Entry point from the Luisenplatz to the most pleasant part of Potsdam running along Branderburgerstrasse. Worth a look if you plan to spend some time not only",
          "When visiting Sanssouci Park and castles rent your bikes at the Brandenburger Tor hotel. Super practical and you don't have to schlepp them all the way from the train station. The monument itself us quite normal.",
          "We toured quaint Brandenburg and enjoyed seeing the mini Brandenburg Gate. You get great views from the main street. There were a lot of tourists here because of the proximity to Frederick the Great's palaces. There are plenty of good photo opportunities around this gate.",
          "The gate is fine - I valued it more as a hub for all the going ons in the city. It's the beginning of Brandenburger Stra\u00dfe, and there seemed to always be some live music or something happening right out in the plaza in front.",
          "In the middle of the city, you need to visit it and for sure you will see it - can miss it. Take a walk behind the gate in the shopping and cafe area and go to see the Holland quarter.",
          "the visit to Potsdam was a highlight fora shot visit in Germany. If you go to Berlin make this day trip ... the gate is only part of the charm of this town",
          "This beautiful piece of architecture I believe is the original Brandenburg gate and is at the entrance to the old village of Potsdam which is just so beautiful and worth a visit. Across the road is a large square which has a fountain and cafes and restaurants around it, really",
          "The Luisenplatz is in the centre of Potsdam and the Brandenburge gate . built by a prussian king- is a bit smaller than ist namesake in Berlin, but impressive None the less.",
          "Less well-known than the iconic Berlin gate, this beautiful gate is well worth seeing. It looks gorgeous in the sun. There is plenty of space to enjoy it on the way to the Sansouci Palace.",
          "Instead of a city wall, the entire length of the wall is now a beautiful promenade that is a joy to cycle through. I really love both Berlin\u2019s and Potsdam\u2019s ample cycling paths. It really beats walking. The promonade connects the Nauener Tor to Potsdam very own Brandenburg Gate.",
          "Frederick the Great, decided to make a second one in 1773 not far from his Palace. Obviously based on Roman models, though smaller than the Berlin Brandenburger Tor is nonethe less impressive",
          "Much more impressive than the one in Berlin. Lots of restaurnat on the way to it, shops, coffee houses and artists. Very nice place and not to be missed when in Potsdam. Recommended!",
          "If you are in Berlin, you can't not visit the Brandenburg gate. It stands at the bottom of \"Unter den Linden\" just in front of the Tiergarten. We passed by it many times on our wanders around Berlin, and it was always very busy with tourists as you would expect. One thing we",
          "The gate was viewed from both sides and is attractive but pales in comparison to the gate in Berlin with its beautiful sculpture on the top.",
          "I wasn't able to see the gate in Berlin due to a festival. I desited to spend my day in Potsdam and see the gate there. It is quite smaller than the other in Berlin but worth to see it.",
          "What do I say...How many bloody beautiful gates can you go through. Well you can go through a loot in Potsdam and they are all beautiful. May I say that this is one of the best towns we have been in in Germany.",
          "If you go to see Potsdam Garden you should also make a walk through the city. We enjoyed this city and this Gate was nice to see too. Stop for coffee etc. We stayed in Berlin, but it was good to visit here too.",
          "If you pass by and make some photos, it is good enough. Nothing special, but if you are anyhow in the area, just stop.",
          "We had a walk through the town which once upon a time was the main town. You can still observe some buildings which have not been refurbished and have the old rustic look reminiscent of the war period. The area also contains houses which are modeled as per other cultures like",
          "It is a nice place but beside going under the gate there is not much to do or see. There is a nice view of the church through the gate, and if you are looking for shops it is the place (C&A, Zara and so on).",
          "The Brandenburger Gate is quite impressive and the beginning of a charming part of Potsdam marked off for pedestrian traffic. Shops and restaurants are abundant.",
          "Very similar to the Brandenburger gate in Berlin without the gilded chariot monument on the top.One of several gates around the city.",
          "Nice place to enjoy street performances and people watch at the end of a day. Have a drink at the Matador to enjoy it in the shade.",
          "This is right in the middle of town. We just happened upon it. It is hard to miss. Good pictures around it. Potsdam is a good town to stop in if you are near. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit though. Nothing to do here.",
          "The best of the three town gates but nothing very special. Lots of traffic but worth walking past on the way to somewhere else.",
          "This gate was built as a victory symbol for Frederick the Great to commemorate his sucess in the 7 year's war. It used to be part of a city wall and people went through this gate into the town of Brandenburg. The interesting thing about this triumphal arch is its two sides",
          "Nice place to hang out in good weather, with the square surrounded by restaurants with outdoor seating",
          "It's nice to see, check off the list. The walk through the neighborhood around it is much more interesting. Surrounded by nice restaurants and cafes, it stands between the Hbf and other major touristic objectives, so it's hard to miss.",
          "Lovely gate in the Dutch Quarter of Potsdam. The entire area is picturesque and charming, a must while visiting Potsdam.",
          "its a nice square and in the middle is the brandeburger gate and on th eleft starts also an entrance to sanssouci park .",
          "Brandenburger street is linked the church and the gate ,Its not something very different or special from other gates in Germany but its a lovely street to walk and have a coffee and see the neighbourhood !! take some pictures too!!",
          "This gate is smaller than Berlin Brandenburgertor but its so cute located in the middle of old postdam with a street full of store and restaurant on the back makes this gate is stand out in the crowd.The great Sansoucci park are minutes away to walk from this gate.",
          "This leads on the main street and it is pretty impressive to look at and in the summer I am sure there is a lot going on around it but in winter it is pretty bare but still work a look.",
          "We had an amazing view of the Gate from our hotel, see my other reviews. Loved this historical beauty.",
          "The Brandenburg gate in Potsdam was not a good as the one in Berlin. It is located in a neat old square at the heart of old Potsdam so its well worth swinging by!",
          "Nice and no more. In his back there is a pedestrian mall where are some good restaurants. Walking distance from the Sanssouci Park.",
          "The gate is symbolic of the old city of Potsdam--make sure to eat while you are there. IT is amazing that something so close to Berlin survived without damage!",
          "This matches the Brandenburger Tor in Berlin. Beautiful to see but quite hard to find and no sign posts",
          "If you are visiting Potsdam, you should visit Brandenburger Gate. It is one of the stops if you are taking the hop on/off sightseeing bus. The gate itself is smaller compared to the one in Berlin but I like the surroundings. Behind the gate you can find a lot of restaurants and",
          "A small version of the real Tor, nothing special but can be done if walking in the area. Lots of cafe and shopping near by",
          "This is one of those things that is worth a visit as it's an important piece of history but it's not somewhere where you will stay long and there's not much to see. I'd recommend doing it as part of a bus tour where you either see it from the bus or hop off and have a quick",
          "We enjoyed our visit to Potsdam and will be visiting again in the future. There is a lot to see and it takes more that a single visit.",
          "The original! Loved the entire area. Lots of small shops in the area. Bit of a tourist trap, but worth it. Try the little ice cream shop nearby!",
          "Been there after a long day at the sans Sousi park. We had nice view from the coffee shop opposite of the gate. Not something special but you cannot miss it when being at the area",
          "Our Segway tour rounded this corner then wow there it was - towering above us in all its grandure and hidden tales of historical significance and now serving for us as a monument for orientation.",
          "it is at he beginning of the main pedestrian and shopping street in Potsdam, there is a nice fountain and few restaurants so you can sit and watch the life around",
          "The gate is an excellent visit. It is to be seen at night when lights brighten it given its well chosen color as well. It is kind of a reminder of the Triumph Arch of Paris on a smaller scale.",
          "The 2 facades are different on this triumphal gate across the street from an entrance to SanSouci park.",
          "Great place to visit. Go at night as they light it up beautifully and to the park just over from it in the day. This is a must if you visit Berlin."

It has been open to public since April 30, 2006 and shows a collection of Liebermann's paintings of his villa and its garden.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Max Liebermann ===\nMax Liebermann (1847\u20131935) was co-founder and head of the Berlin Secession and head of the Prussian Academy of Arts (Preu\u00dfische Akademie der K\u00fcnste). He was dismissed by the Nazis in 1933 and banned. He painted about 200 paintings of the garden at his villa, some of which are exhibited in his former studio on the upper floor.\n\n\n=== Villa ===\nIn 1909, he bought a narrow piece of land with direct access to the shores of Lake Wannsee to escape from the city noise of Berlin. He lived there during the summer, from 1910 on. The villa was built by the architect Paul Otto Baumgarten. Liebermann called it his \"little castle by the lake\".\nIt was completed in April, 1910.\n\n\n=== Garden ===\nThe lengthy garden is divided in two by the villa itself. From the center of the villa, there is a view over the grass to Lake Wannsee. There is a garden terrace in front of the house, looking toward Wannsee. On one side of the grass, there is the famous birch path, with birch trees growing wherever they sprout. On the other side, there are three hedged gardens. In the rear of the villa, is the garden house and a vegetable plot.\n\n\n== Museum ==\n\n\n=== Permanent exhibition ===\nIn the former studio, on the upper floor, there are about 40 paintings related to the garden and the villa. On the ground floor, the history of the Liebermann family and the house are documented, including of how the Nazis forced Liebermann's wife, Martha to sell the villa. The selling price was highly undervalued and in the end, she didn't even get that. Hours before she was due to be deported to Theresienstadt concentration camp, she committed suicide rather than risk death at the hands of the Nazis.\n\n\n=== Museum's concept ===\nThe Max-Liebermann-Gesellschaft Berlin e. V. assists the museum in care of the villa and garden and in restoring them to their original state at the time of the Liebermanns' occupancy. Paintings of the garden and villa are presented continuously. A Multimedia Installation by Heiko Daxl and Ingeborg F\u00fclepp opens a broader view with historical documents, photographs, sound recordings and films into the 100 years turbulent history of the house and the garden. Visitors can experience the serenity and spirit of the villa as Liebermann did when he lived and painted there.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nNina Nedelykov, Pedro Moreira (eds.): Zur\u00fcck am Wannsee.

        "wiki": "The Glienicke Bridge (German: Glienicker Br\u00fccke, German pronunciation ) is a bridge across the Havel River in Germany, connecting the Wannsee district of Berlin with the Brandenburg capital Potsdam. It is named after nearby Glienicke Palace. The current bridge, the fourth on the site, was completed in 1907, although major reconstruction was necessary after it was damaged during World War II.During the Cold War, as this portion of the Havel River formed the border between West Berlin and East Germany, the bridge was used several times for the exchange of captured spies and thus became known as the Bridge of Spies.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe bridge spans the Havel narrows between the Jungfernsee (lake) to the north and the Glienicker Lake to the south. It carries the Bundesstra\u00dfe 1 highway. The Glienicke Palace and Jagdschloss Glienicke are situated (across the highway from each other) near the east (Berlin) end of the bridge. Potsdam tram route 93 from Potsdam main station and Berlin bus route 316 from Wannsee station terminate and interconnect at a tram stop on the Potsdam end of the bridge. The respective Potsdam and Wannsee stations are served by the Berlin S-Bahn and by longer distance trains.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nA first wooden bridge across the Havel River at this location was built about 1660, in order to reach the hunting grounds around Stolpe. By the early 1800s, a new, non-wooden bridge was needed to accommodate the massive increase in traffic on the chaussee between the Prussian capital Berlin and the Hohenzollern residence in Potsdam. The architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel designed a brick and wood bascule bridge, which was finished in 1834. By the early 20th century, Schinkel's bridge was no longer able to handle the increased volume in traffic, and operating the moveable sections of the bridge caused delays in steamer traffic on the Havel River.\nIn 1904, the Prussian government held a design competition to replace Schinkel's bridge with a modern, iron bridge. The Johann Caspar Harkort Company of Duisburg submitted the winning design, and the present-day bridge was inaugurated on 16 November 1907.\nThe German film studio UFA shot the film Unter den Br\u00fccken (Under the Bridges) at the Glienicke Bridge in 1944 and 1945. At the end of April 1945, an unexploded shell severely damaged the bridge. The reconstruction of the steel bridge was not completed until 1949, after the establishment of West Germany and East Germany. The East German government named it the \u201cBridge of Unity\" as the border between East Germany and Western Allied-occupied West Berlin ran across the middle of the bridge.\n\n\n=== Cold War ===\nDuring the early years of the Cold War, the bridge was mainly used by the Allies as a link between their Berlin sections and the military liaison missions in Potsdam. German residents of the two cities more frequently used the S-Bahn suburban rail to travel between Berlin and Potsdam. On 27 May 1952, East German authorities closed the bridge to citizens of West Berlin and West Germany. The bridge was closed to East German citizens after the construction of the Berlin Wall in August 1961. Only allied military personnel and foreign diplomats were allowed to access the bridge at any time.\nOf all the checkpoints between West Berlin and East Berlin, as well as those between West Berlin and East Germany, the Glienicke Bridge had the uniqueness of being the only such checkpoint of not only having a Soviet presence, but also of being under full Soviet control; all other checkpoints were under East German control, and had no Soviet presence.\nBy the 1970s, the bridge had outlived its projected lifespan and needed significant repairs. The cost of these repairs became a focus of a dispute between the government of West Berlin and the government of East Germany. In 1980 the West Berlin government repaired its half of the bridge, and in 1985 the West Berlin government paid for repairs to the East German half of the bridge in exchange for formally renaming the bridge \"Glienicke Bridge\" from \"Bridge of Unity.\"\nOn the evening of 10 November 1989, one day after the opening of the Berlin Wall, the Glienicke Bridge was reopened for pedestrians. Border fortifications and barricades were dismantled as a part of German reunification in 1990.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Bridge of Spies ===\nBecause the Glienicke Bridge was a restricted border crossing between the Eastern Bloc (namely Potsdam in East Germany) and territory affiliated with the Western powers (namely the American sector of West Berlin), the Americans and Soviets used it for the exchange of captured spies during the Cold War. Reporters began calling it the \"Bridge of Spies.\" When this name was later used as the title for various works, it was often taken to be a pun on \"bridge of sighs\" a name applied first to the bridge in Venice and then to others.The first prisoner exchange took place on 10 February 1962. The Americans released Rudolf Abel, convicted for spying for the Soviet Union in 1957, in exchange for Gary Powers, the pilot of a U-2 spy plane shot down in 1960.\nOn 12 June 1985, there was a swap of 23 American agents held in Eastern Europe for Polish agent Marian Zacharski and another three Soviet agents arrested in the West. The exchange was the result of three years of negotiation.The final exchange was also the most public. On 11 February 1986 the human rights campaigner (refusenik) and political prisoner Anatoly Shcharansky (now known as Natan Sharansky) and three Western agents were exchanged for Karl Koecher and four other Eastern agents.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nThe Glienicke bridge as a venue for prisoner exchange has appeared frequently in fiction, most notably in John Le Carr\u00e9's novel Smiley's People and the related BBC miniseries, as well as in the 1966 Harry Palmer film, Funeral in Berlin, based on the novel of the same name by Len Deighton.\nThe popular nickname 'Bridge of Spies' was used by the British band T'Pau as the name of the title track on their first album. The usage is metaphorical, referring to a 'walk to freedom' but in the context of a long-dreamt-of relationship.\nThe bridge is referenced in the children's TV series Codename: Kids Next Door, specifically when a bridge in a local mall is used to exchange a spy from the KND in return for a spy from the Teenagers, a parody of real-life prisoner exchanges.\nThere is a brief reference to the bridge in the sixth episode of the first season of Archer, when Mallory Archer and her long-time lover (and head of the KGB) Major Nikolai Jakov mention meeting there \"one moonlit night\" when they both worked on covert operations in Berlin, presumably during the Cold War.\nThe 2015 film Bridge of Spies, directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Hanks, features the Powers\u2013Abel prisoner exchange on the bridge as a major plot element.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nBridge of No Return\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPotsdam from Above - Glienicker Bruecke\nGlienicke Bridge at Structurae\n\"23rd Hour\" describes Glienicke Bridge in 1969\nThe House at the Bridge The history of the postwar kindergarten at the foot of the bridge",

        "wiki": "The Olympiastadion (German pronunciation: [\u0294o\u02c8l\u028fmpi\u032fa\u02d0\u02cc\u0283ta\u02d0di\u032f\u0254n]) is a sports stadium at Olympiapark Berlin in Berlin, Germany. It was originally built by Werner March for the 1936 Summer Olympics. During the Olympics, the record attendance was thought to be over 100,000. Today the stadium is part of the Olympiapark Berlin.\nSince renovations in 2004, the Olympiastadion has a permanent capacity of 74,475 seats and is the largest stadium in Germany for international football matches. The Olympiastadion is a UEFA category four stadium and one of the world's most prestigious venues for sporting and entertainment events.\nBesides its use as an athletics stadium, the arena has built a footballing tradition. Since 1963, it has been the home of the Hertha BSC. It hosted three matches in the 1974 FIFA World Cup. It was renovated for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, when it hosted six matches, including the final. The DFB-Pokal final match is held each year at the venue. The Olympiastadion Berlin served as a host for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup as well as the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1916\u20131934: Deutsches Stadion ===\n\nDuring the 1912 Summer Olympics, the city of Berlin was designated by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to host the 1916 Summer Olympics. Germany's proposed stadium for this event was to be located in Charlottenburg, in the Grunewald Forest, to the west of Berlin\u2014thus the stadium was also known as Grunewaldstadion. A horse racing-course already existed there which belonged to the Berliner Rennverein, and even today the old ticket booths survive on Jesse-Owens-Allee. The government of Germany decided not to build in the nearby Grunewald forest, or to renovate buildings that already existed. Because of this desire, they hired the same architect who originally had built the \"Rennverein\", Otto March.\nMarch decided to bury the stadium in the ground (\"Erdstadion\", in German). However, the 1916 Olympic Games were cancelled due to World War I. In the 1920s the first buildings of a school, the \"Deutsches Sportforum\" (German Sport Forum), dedicated to the teaching of professors of physical education and the study of sport science were built northeast of the stadium site. From 1926 to 1929, Otto March's sons (Werner and Walter) were assigned to build an annex for these institutions, though the finalization was delayed until 1936.\n\n\n=== 1936\u20131945: Olympiastadion ===\n\nIn 1931, the International Olympic Committee selected Berlin to host the 11th Summer Olympics. Originally, the German government decided merely to restore the earlier Olympiastadion (Olympic Stadium) of 1916, with Werner March again retained to do this.\nWhen the Nazis came to power in Germany (1933), they decided to use the Olympic Games in 1936 for propaganda purposes. With these plans in mind, Adolf Hitler ordered the construction of a great sports complex in Grunewald named the \"Reichssportfeld\" with a totally new Olympiastadion. Architect Werner March remained in charge of the project, assisted by his brother Walter.\nConstruction took place from 1934 to 1936. When the Reichssportfeld was finished, it was 132 hectares (330 acres). It consisted of (east to west):  the Olympiastadion, the Maifeld (Mayfield, capacity of 50,000) and the Waldb\u00fchne amphitheater (capacity of 25,000), in addition to various places, buildings and facilities for different sports (such as football, swimming, equestrian events, and field hockey) in the northern part.\nWerner March built the new Olympiastadion on the foundation of the original Deutsches Stadion, once again with the lower half of the structure recessed 12 metres (39.4 feet) below ground level.\nThe capacity of the Olympiastadion reached 110,000 spectators. It also possessed a special stand for Adolf Hitler and his political associates. At its end, aligned with the symmetrically-designed layout of the buildings of the Olympischer Platz and toward the Maifeld, was the Marathon Gate with a big receptacle for the Olympic Flame.\n\n\n==== Maifeld ====\n\nThe Maifeld (Mayfield) was created as a huge lawn (11.2 hectares, 28 acres) for gymnastic demonstrations, specifically annual May Day celebrations by the government. The area was surrounded by 19 metres of land elevation (62 ft), even though the Olympiastadion (to the east) was only 17 metres (55 ft) high. The total capacity was 250,000 people, with 60,000 in the large stands that extended at the west end.\nAlso located there were the Langemarck-Halle (below) and the Bell Tower (rising high).  The walls were built with sturdy stone from the area of the Lower Alps, and also feature equine sculptures (work of Josef Wackerle).  This consisted of huge halls built under the stands of the Maifeld. Pillars were raised on which hung flags and shields commemorating all the forces that participated in a battle fought in Langemark (West Flanders, Belgium) on 10 November 1914, during the First World War. Since 2006, the ground floor is home to a public exhibit providing historical information on the area of the former Reichssportfeld.\nDuring the 1936 Olympics, the Maifeld was used for polo and equestrian dressage events.\nAfter the Second World War, the occupying forces of the British Army (Berlin Infantry Brigade) annually celebrated the King's or Queen's Official Birthday on the Maifeld and used it for a variety of sporting activities including cricket. Starting in 2012, Maifeld became home to the Berlin Cricket Club.\n\n\n==== Bell Tower ====\n\nThe Bell Tower crowned the western end of the Reichs Sportfield planted amid the tiers of the Maifeld stands. It was 77 metres (247 ft) high. From its peak could be observed the whole city of Berlin. During the games, it was used as observation post by administrators and police officials, doctors and the media.\nIn the tower was the Olympic Bell. On its surface were the Olympic Rings with an eagle, the year 1936, the Brandenburg Gate, the date 1.-16. August and a motto between two swastikas: I call the youth of the world and 11. Olympic Games Berlin \u2013 although the games were the 10th (Summer) Olympics, they were the Games of the XI Olympiad.\nThe Bell Tower was the only part of the Reichssportfeld that was destroyed in the war. The Third Reich used the tower's structure to store archives (such as films). The Soviet troops set its contents on fire, turning the tower into a makeshift chimney. The structure emerged from the fire severely damaged and weakened.\nIn 1947, the British engineers demolished the tower; however, it was reconstructed accurately in 1962. The Olympic Bell (which had survived the fire and remained in its place in the tower) fell 77 metres and cracked and has been incapable of sounding since then. In 1956, the bell was rescued, only in order to be used as a practice target for shooting with anti-tank ammunition. The damaged old bell survives and serves as a memorial.\nThe recreation of the tower was carried out from 1960 to 1962, once again by the architect Werner March, following the original blueprints. The present tower became an important tourist destination offering a panorama of Berlin, Spandau, the Havel Valley, Potsdam, Nauen and Hennigsdorf.\nThe most significant battle around the Olympiastadion was in April 1945 when the Soviet army fought to capture it. This was during the final battle of the Second World War in Europe, with the total invasion of Berlin as the Allies' target.  The Olympiastadion survived the war almost untouched; it only suffered the impact of machine gun shots.\n\n\n=== 1945\u20131990: West Berlin era ===\n\nAfter the war, the former Reichssportfeld became the headquarters of the British military occupation forces. The administration settled in the northeastern buildings designed by the March brothers in the 1920s, which the Third Reich had used for official sport organisations such as the Reich Academy of Physical Training and extended by 1936, adding the \"Haus des deutschen Sports\" (House of German Sports) and other buildings (which belong since 1994 to the Olympiapark Berlin, a central sporting facility of the City of Berlin). Soon, the British forces renovated war-damaged buildings but also converted interiors to their specific needs (one gymnasium was converted into a dining hall, another into a garage).  From 1951 to 2005, the Olympischer Platz had a giant antenna transmitting for all the portable radios in Berlin.\nFrom then until 1994 and their departure, British forces held an annual celebration of the Queen's Official Birthday in the Maifeld with thousands of spectators from Berlin present. During the 1960s, American military and high school football teams introduced hundreds of thousands of Berliners to American football at the stadium in exhibition games.\nDuring those years, Bundesliga football matches were played in the Olympiastadion, with Hertha BSC as local team. In the Maifeld, several competitions of football, rugby and polo were staged too. In the summers, the Waldb\u00fchne resumed its classical music concerts, and playing movies. The theatre was also used as an improvised ring for boxing matches.\n\n\n=== 1990\u20132004: Reunified Berlin ===\n\nIn 1998, Berliners debated the destiny of the Olympiastadion in light of the legacy it represented for Germany. Some wanted to tear the stadium down and build a new one from scratch, while others favoured letting it slowly crumble \"like the Colosseum in Rome\". Finally, it was decided to renovate the Olympiastadion.\nFIFA chose it as one of the venues of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The State of Berlin hired a consortium composed of Walter Bau AG and DYWIDAG that won the \u20ac45 million franchise. The consortium took charge of the operation of the facilities together with Hertha BSC and the Government of Berlin after the remodelling. On 3 July 2000, the renovation began with a ceremony presided over by the Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, accompanied by Eberhard Diepgen (Mayor of Berlin), Franz Beckenbauer and Prof. Dr. Ignaz Walter.\n\n\n=== 2004\u2013present: Multi-purpose arena ===\nThe re-inauguration celebrations of the new Olympic Stadium were carried out on 31 July 2004, and 1 August 2004. On that day, Saturday, the party began with performances from Pink, Nena and Daniel Barenboim. It culminated at night with the opening ceremony. On day two, friendly matches were played between different categories of the club Hertha BSC and visiting teams. On 8 September 2004, Brazil played Germany.\nIn 2011, the venue hosted the World Culture Festival organized by the Art of Living where 70,000 people meditated for peace.\n\nIn 2018, the venue hosted the 2018 European Athletics Championships.\n\n\n== Stadium ==\n\n\n=== Renovation ===\n\nWith the intention of creating a more intimate atmosphere for football games, the playing field was lowered by 2.65 metres (8.7 ft). Approximately 90,000 cubic metres (3,200,000 cu ft) of sand was excavated. The lower tier of seating in the stadium was demolished and rebuilt at a completely different angle of inclination.\nThe roof was extended to cover a total of 37,000 square metres (400,000 sq ft), with 20 roof-supporting columns carrying a weight of 3,500 tonnes (3,900 short tons) of steel. The roof rises 68 metres (223 ft) over the seats and is made up of transparent panels that allow sunlight to stream in during the day. The western portion (on the Marathon Arch) is open to reveal the Bell Tower to the spectators.\nThe conservation factor of the Olympiastadion as a historical monument was also considered, especially with respect to the preservation of the natural stone blocks. After criticisms, the colour of the athletics track around the game field was changed from red to blue, reflecting the colours of Hertha BSC.\nThe renovations used 70,000 cubic metres (2,500,000 cu ft) of concrete and 20,000 cubic metres (710,000 cu ft) of pre-cast reinforced concrete elements. Some 12,000 cubic metres (420,000 cu ft) of concrete was demolished and removed and 30,000 cubic metres (1,100,000 cu ft) of natural stone was refurbished.\nThe Olympiastadion was equipped with the latest technology in artificial illumination and sound equipment. It has 113 VIP stands, a set of restaurants, and two underground garages (for 630 cars). The total cost of the remodelling and amplification was \u20ac242 million.\n\n\n=== Capacity ===\nThe new Olympic Stadium has the highest all-seated capacity in Germany. It has a permanent capacity of 74,475 seats. The upper tier has 31 seating rows at an average slope of 23\u00b0 and houses 36,455 seats, of which 36,032 are regular seats, 290 are seats on the press stand and 133 are seats in skyboxes. The lower tier has 42 seating rows at an average angle of 25,4\u00b0 and houses 38,020 seats, of which 32,310 are regular seats, 560 are box seats, 563 are lounge seats (expandable to 743), 4,413 are business seats and 174 are wheelchair spaces.For certain football matches, such as those between Hertha BSC and FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen, the capacity can be temporarily expanded. This is made by the addition of mobile grandstand over the Marathon Arch. The extended capacity reached 76,197 seats in 2014.The only stadiums in Germany that have higher total capacities are the Signal Iduna Park in Dortmund and the Allianz Arena in Munich. However, the Signal Iduna Park and the Allianz Arena have both seating and standing areas, and their all-seated capacities are lower than that of the Olympiastadion. The total capacity of the Allianz Arena is also lower than the extended capacity of the Olympiastadion.\n\n\n== Tenant ==\nThe stadium has been used as the home venue for the Bundesliga's Hertha BSC since 1963. In 1963, the Bundesliga was formed, and Hertha BSC participated by direct invitation, leaving its old stadium (the \"Plumpe\") to use the Olympiastadion. On 24 August, it played the first local match against 1. FC N\u00fcrnberg, with the final score 1\u20131.\nHowever, in 1965, the German Football Association found Hertha BSC guilty of bribery and relegated them to the Regional Leagues.\nIn 1968, Hertha returned to the first division, and to the Olympiastadion, and in 1971 sold \"Plumpe\". The second half of the 1970s was quite successful for Hertha BSC Berlin. In 1979, it reached the semifinals of the UEFA Cup, but was defeated by Red Star Belgrade. Hertha reached the finals of the German Cup twice (1977 and 1979). In the 1980s, Hertha had a declining role in the Bundesliga, and fell to the Regional Leagues in 1986, although they later recovered reaching the Second Division (1988\u20131989).\nWith the demolition of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, a spontaneous feeling of sympathy between Hertha and 1. FC Union Berlin from Eastern Berlin arose, which culminated in a friendly match at the Olympiastadion with 50,000 spectators (27 January 1990). In 1990, Hertha returned to the First Division, although it fell again to the Second Division from 1991 until 1997.\nSince 1997, the club has improved, climbing up the Bundesliga table and qualifying for the UEFA Champions League, with matches against top European teams like Chelsea and A.C. Milan.\n\n\n== Notable events ==\n\nThe Olympiastadion held the world record for the attendance of a baseball game during the 1936 Olympics thought to be over 100,000.\nSince 1985, the stadium has hosted the finals of both the DFB-Pokal and its companion women's tournament, the Frauen DFB Pokal. However, it did not host the 2010 final of the Frauen DFB Pokal, which was held at Cologne's RheinEnergieStadion as part of an experimental test to host the event in a different city.\nThe stadium hosted five American Bowls between 1990-1994.  The stadium was also home to Berlin Thunder, an American football team in NFL Europa, from 2003 until the league's operator, the U.S. National Football League, closed down the money-losing competition in 2007.\nThe stadium also hosted The World Culture Festival. 2011 was to celebrate 30 years of service to humanity by Art of Living Foundation.\nThe stadium also hosts the Internationales Stadionfest, which also served as an IAAF Golden League event until 2010. The future of the event is currently unknown.\nThe stadium hosted the 2009 World Championships in Athletics where Usain Bolt broke the 100 metres and 200 metres world records.\n\n\n=== 1936 Summer Olympics ===\n\nOn 1 August 1936, the Olympics were officially inaugurated by the head of state Adolf Hitler, and the Olympic cauldron was lit by athlete Fritz Schilgen. Four million tickets were sold for all the events of the 1936 Summer Olympics. This was also the first Olympics with television transmission (25 viewing spaces were scattered all over Berlin and Potsdam) and radio transmissions in 28 languages (with 20 radio vans and 300 microphones).\nWhile the Olympic flame had been used for the first time in Amsterdam 1928, in Berlin 1936 a marathon-like tour of the Olympic torch was introduced, from Olympia in Greece, crossing six frontiers with a journey of 3,000 kilometres (1,900 mi) to Berlin, through Greece, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Austria and Germany. The original idea of this Olympic torch relay was Carl Diem's, who was a political advisor to Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, specialising in Olympic affairs. The Olympics were the subject of the propaganda film Olympia (1938) by Leni Riefenstahl.\nAmong the sport competitions, one of the most memorable events was the performance of the African-American track and field athlete Jesse Owens, representing the United States of America. Owens won the gold medal in the 100, 200, long jump and 4 x 100 relay. One of the main streets outside the stadium is named Jesse Owens Allee in recognition of his performance. The stadium also hosted the equestrian jumping, football, and handball events.\n\n\n=== 1974 FIFA World Cup Group A ===\n\nThree matches from Group A (West Germany, Chile, East Germany and Australia) were played in the Olympiastadion. The third match, Australia vs Chile, was played in torrential rain. The historic match between the two German teams, however, was played in Hamburg. The hosts, West Germany, won the tournament.\n\n\n=== 2006 FIFA World Cup ===\nThe following matches were played in Berlin, for the 2006 FIFA World Cup:\n\n\n=== 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup ===\nIn 2011, the Olympiastadion hosted Germany's opening match in the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. It was the only match in the tournament to be contested at the stadium.\n\n\n=== 2015 UEFA Champions League Final ===\nIn May 2013, the Olympiastadion was chosen as the venue for the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final. FC Barcelona won their fifth title and completed a second treble.\n\n\n== Concerts ==\n\n\n== Cultural references ==\nThe stadium was used as a location scene in the cinematic cold-war spy drama The Quiller Memorandum (1966).\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== U-Bahn ===\nThe underground train (U-Bahn) U2 takes visitors directly to the station Olympiastadion. It's a short walk from there to the stadium (East Gate entrance: 500m, South Gate entrance: 870m). Average travel time: 14 minutes from Zoologischer Garten, 24 minutes from Potsdamer Platz, 34 minutes from Alexanderplatz.\n\n\n=== S-Bahn ===\nThe regional train  (S-Bahn) S5 takes visitors directly to the station Olympiastadion. It's a short walk from there to the stadium (South Gate entrance via exit Flatowallee: 200 m, East Gate entrance via exit Trakehner Allee: 250m). Average travel time: 7 minutes from Spandau station, 14 minutes from Zoologischer Garten, 22 minutes from Friedrichstrasse, 26 minutes from Alexanderplatz.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nWith the bus lines M49 and 218 visitors can reach the stop Flatowallee. It's a short walk from there to the stadium. With the bus line 104 visitors can reach the underground station Neu-Westend. From there it is a walk directly to the stadium.

          "\u20ac25.50 for a family of 5- booked the guided tour- well worth it even if you don\u2019t like Football!(It\u2019s \u20ac19.99 for family without the tour) Our guide was Anselm Eckold- really informative, and knew his English speaking audience well- with a good number of little jokes here and",
          "The access you get is great ... you can go into the stadium and soak in the atmosphere. There is a cafe there too.",
          "I was looking for a museum,which was closed,in the middle of the fans.I am always uneasy whenever I see this stadium because it was built by the Nazis.",
          "There is nothing like being part of a 'hot' sporting occasion as an outsider! This was the final match of the football season and the fans were out in force - loud and passionate. Only pride was at stake for Hertha but Bayer had the chance of Champions League with a win.",
          "Really enjoyed the experience here. Far exceeded all our expectations. The walk up and winding road built the anticipation. Some things left untouched. Only 5euro per person so long as you had the Berlin welcome card. The arena itself vast and immaculate. Toilets available on",
          "Berlin is definetly a city to be visited. Very interesting historic places and museums. A trip to \u201cWannsee\u201d is a must, especially during summer time. Prices are moderate compared with other capitals in Europe.",
          "We went on the guided tour which was a great way to learn about the stadium and get some behind the scenes look. Tour guide was extremely friendly. You are allowed walk around freely afterwards which is a great way to get some good photos and do some more exploring.",
          "We went to a game (7 friends from Ireland) while we were in Berlin celebrating a 40th. Well worth the \u20ac20 to experience 51,000 screaming fans. Great to do on a \"lads trip\". So accessible by public transport and a few beers in the sun in the beer garden outside beforehand.",
          "Guided tour (available in English and deutsch) is really worth of money, highly recommended. Easy to access with a U Bahn.",
          "Don\u2019t go. We had the most awful experience as a family visiting in February half term. The place was empty and after our children mistakenly squeezed round a \u2018fan barrier\u2019 whilst looking to leave the empty stadium, the whole family was ordered (and I mean ordered in an the most",
          "Amazing architecture, an iconic and historic building from the 1930's. I did not have time to do the stadium tour. But next time in Berlin I will do it for sure.",
          "Absolutely must-see in Berlin. Historical building after modern renovation is one of the biggest and great venues in Europe.",
          "We went by electric bikes. Easy to park outside. Even there were around 51.000 people we did not feel we had to stand in long queues. Easy to access the supporter store and to get soft drinks. Great atmosphere even the teams Hertha Berlin - Dusseldorf didnt have much to play",
          "I visited the Olympiastadion with my husband and two sons and we did the tour using an audio guide. Having done a number of stadium tours in the past, including at Camp Nou, Anfield and the Bernabeu, we thought that this could have been better. The history of the stadium",
          "Very interesting place to visit and only 5 euros for seniors. Friendly staff and nice restaurant/cafe.",
          "Came her for a Hertha game the atmosphere was amazing people chilling outside before the game with beers. The stadium was amazing as well. Def worth trying to get tickets if they are playing when you are in Berlin",
          "The stadium is a venue for concerts, but most of all for Berlin's local first league soccer team of Hertha BSC. Try to get tickets for almost sold out matches and you will experience the fantastic atmosphere of more than 70000 spectators singing and applauding. The history of",
          "Had a great day out watching Hertha v Fortuna. Sadly, the home team lost, but what an atmosphere! The Ostkurve section made a lot of noise throughout the match. Definitely worth seeing. Warning: beer inside the stadium in alcohol free!",
          "My girlfriend and I went here on a Tuesday midday. There\u2019s a train that goes directly to to the stadium so transport is easy. We paid for the English guided tour which began at 11:30am (there is the option to book online but it\u2019s not necessary). It cost us \u20ac9 each with a reduced",
          "We visited without a guided tour, as the English tours were only available at 11:00 AM, which did not fit into our agenda. Without interactive explanations and anecdotal information, it was not as interesting as it could have been. Perhaps if you prepare in advance and download",
          "Came here for a Hertha Berlin match. Fantastic experience with a great atmosphere. If your in Berlin you need to see a game here if you can.",
          "As a fan of the Olympics this was the highlight of the trip to Berlin for me. An impressive modern stadium with some fascinating history, not least the 1936 Olympics.",
          "Amazing stadium experience. The architecture is simply breathtaking combining classic with modern elements, the environment surrounding the stadium is beautiful and worth a walk around it.Went on a Non-Match day & early in the morning. Got more time to see the places with not",
          "We loved our visit here. It didn\u2019t get much of a mention in the guide book but well worth the visit as far as we were concerned. It is a bit further out but an easy ride on the U2 underground line. It was very quiet when we went and we could wander around exploring. Good",
          "I was there on a cold, rainy Monday afternoon so I mostly had the place to myself. It was interesting seeing where the controversial 1936 Olympics took place. The pool is still there too and also in use!",
          "Located on the outskirts of the city centre the Olympiastadion is a unique stadium that mixes the original stadium with the modern upgrades it had ahead of the 2006 World Cup. The architecture is almost mock Roman and is very much designed to be very grand to promote the Nazi",
          "This visit was the highlight of Berlin. Great stories and amazing building. Worth a visit here. The building is amazing and grounds fantisric.",
          "It was really my husband who wanted to come here and see the stadium but I am glad we did. There was so much to see and lots of information to absorb. I did not realise the history the stadium held and found this to be a really eye opening experience. The place is clean and tidy",
          "Arrived to find the place deserted. Couldn\u2019t find the way in, but did eventually! Stadium itself is awe -inspiring. Despite renovations it is not hard to imagine it in 1936... swimming pool hasn\u2019t changed at all. Information boards give helpful details of the history. Structure",
          "If you\u2019re a sports fan and you don\u2019t visit the OlympiaStadion then you\u2019re more idiotic than Lazaro was for Hertha tonight (check it out on YouTube - Absolute lunacy). He shinned one in his own goal in stoppage time. It really is a great experience. The approach to the main",

          "This iconic stadium is a bit out of town from Berlin in Spandau. It is worth a visit for an football match or concert though. The location means there is lots of space and the stadium is massive. On game day you can catch a train and a beer with the fans heading out to the",
          "What a great stadium. First of all, it\u2019s very nice experience to walk around on the stadium. Then you add up the history, the construction finished to the olympics in 1936, just before the war. Hitler spoke from it several times. Don\u2019t forget to see the old olympic swimming",
          "I have visited the Olympic Stadium on many occasions for football matches, athletics events, concerts and I've even had the pleasure of having my football teams photo being taken on the pitch. The stadium oozes history and class and inside its historic frame there is a modern",
          "The stadium is full of history and the atmosphere is there to go with it. 50,000 inside a 75,000 ground still made for a lively crowd , 40\u20ac for 2 tickets in seats just to the side of their ultras was quality \ud83d\ude0e nothing compared Brentford tho lol \ud83d\ude1d",
          "Totally over whelming , to think they had an Olympics in 1936 their. The stadium had cold feel reflecting its surroundings. You could see the history around the stadium. The original swimming pool from Hitlers\u2019 time. The columns still standing with the Olympic Rings. It was a",
          "Would definitely recommend getting the audio guide as it gives you so much more information and makes the visit more worthwhile.",
          "The atmosphere at the stadion was great and the stadion is big. Transit to the stadion with metro was easy and not much traffic. The fanshop was pretty crowded before the match, but that is the only minus. It was easy to get food on half-time. Even non-football fans of our group",
          "It is hug if you are a sport fan you will enjoy being there it's a very cool place to visit, it's little far from the center",
          "We ordered guided tour and were satisfied with that - we got to go inside the stadium, in the VIP lounge, football players changing rooms. It was interesting to hear many historical things about this place. Great experience especially for those who are interested in sports.",
          "Hertha plays their home games at the stadium. There is an outer wall around the stadium. Between the wall and the stadium there were souvenir and food/beverage kiosks. The seating area is covered and the seats are modern. The stadium is impressive in design and scale. Outside",
          "My boyfriend wanted to do this tour so I was just tagging along but actually found it very interesting considering I'm not at all a football fan. Very informative and was pretty cool getting to sit in the executive chairs etc were there would never be a chance for us to do this",
          "5euros per ticket to walk round yourself which we really enjoyed as can walk at your own pace and take it all in.",
          "Unfortunately all the other buildings were closed at the beginning of November, even though we paid the full summer price. Not happy!",
          "Visited for the Hertha v Hoffenheim game (3-3 what a game!) ticket collection easy, entrance to stadium quick and easy too. Saw a comment on here about a cashless card system in place, this wasn\u2019t the case, paid cash for beers and food all afternoon.",
          "The Olympic stadium is nice to see. Read the brochure carefully not to miss some must see historic details.",
          "I went to see a Hertha Berlin home game at the Olympic Stadium. Even though it was nowhere near a sell out it was pretty good atmosphere. The best part , however was the stadium itself and its neighborhood. After renovations and excellent maintenance the stadium is in mint .",
          "Historic sight yet incredibly well preserved and still used to day as a major sports stadium almost 100 years later. We took the self guided tour and wandered around the stadium, saw the out door pool, race track, statues and monuments. There are descriptions of the Hitler",
          "Jesse Owens won a gold medal in this stadium in front of Hitler. That is what visiting this stadium meant to me He did this in the face of racism and fascism and excelled to greatness.. This is worth the visit. I am not sure how \"great this is on the architecture scale:\" The LA",
          "Olympiastadion is a must see on the map of Berlin. Majestic in it's beauty, rich in history, truly impressive. There is a nice bar there and a fan shop with a nice film through history of the Stadium (available to watch in German and English). I strongly reccommend.",
          "The Olympic Stadium was absolutely beautiful and I loved walking around the site. It was nice and quiet the day that we went meaning that we could walk around in our own time. My only criticism was the lack of information around the site.",
          "We have done several stadium tours around Europe and like to guide ourselves with an audio guide. However, in this case the audio tour was quite disappointing. There was plenty of history given, but the tour itself mostly kept to the periphery of the stadium. No visits to any",
          "Went to the stadium to check out the times etc but ended up just staying there and then. The next guided tour was 90 minutes away, but because we paid for it we were able to explore most of the stadium on our own, including a bar/caf\u00e9. We really enjoyed the tour and found the",
          "While in Berlin, I decided to take the train to the station nearest to the Olympiastadion. I had no intentions on going inside (especially since it was closed) so I just got some pictures and watched the sunset while reading information about the stadium. It would probably have",
          "Great guide (Jenny), showed us around this great stadium, telling us its history and taking us in areas otherwise forbidden. The ladies at the shop (where we bought the tickets) were very kind. We didn't book online in advance, but there were no waiting in line to buy tickets",
          "75,000 spectators Exciting game Order (although you have to know that in Germany you can not put bags into stadiums ...) and overall a really nice experience. It's too bad to smoke in stadiums - it would be better to give up",
          "I always visit the football stadium in whichever City I visit and Berlin was no exception. The tour here was very good and took you into parts of the stadium that you did not know existed. The guide kept me engaged throughout the visit and spoke in English throughout. There was",
          "Tour was just excellent. Got to see a lot of places inside the stadium with great historic commentary and stories. Would definitely recommend.",
          "A stadium full of history (good and bad). From the outside it looks quite small and resembles the colleseum in Rome.once inside it opens up into a modern 70,000 seater stadium. Myself and three friends enjoyed the tour led by our guide Jenny.",
          "This was as part of our Cruise trip. A visit to Berlin which was part of our Jewish tour by SPB Tours. Our Guide was very experienced to provide us in detail about the history of the stadium. You need to purchase ticket to get inside the stadium. I would recommend a 1 hour stay",
          "Has seen top events like Olympics 1936, soccer world championships, athletic events. Easy to reach by public transport.",
          "We were visiting berlin as part of the Berlin marathon and had the chance to visit here and do a lap of the track which was awesome. Great to see one of the roads around the stadium had been renamed Jesse Owens Stasse",
          "Our trip was pre-booked and everything worked extremely well. Our guide Michael was informative and entertaining. We are studying the history of the stadium as part of our IGCSE studies and a tour incorporating the events of 1936 would have been a bonus.",
          "The self guided walking tour is great as their is so much history in this stadium. Also, take time to walk the grounds around the stadium where you can see remnants of other venues from the historic olympic games dominated by Jesse Ownes.",
          "Although I have been to wonderful Berlin often until September 2018 I had never visited the beautiful, historic stadium where Jesse Owens won four Golds in 1936. The visit, convenient by S Bahn was well worth it the site is striking for the well preserved Olympic venues",
          "Really enjoyed our visit to the stadium, there is a lot of history to the place not all of it good but regardless of that it's important that it is not hidden. We took the audio guide which was really informative. Learned a lot on the visit and be sure not to miss the Olympic",
          "We all loved this stadium! The combination of the modern aspects for Hertha and the history of the more traditional aspects of the Olympics makes it so interesting. We spent ages wondering around and taking pictures and all thoroughly enjoyed it. Even though only one was a big",
          "We all know about the Jesse Owen run at this stadium. I went to watch football and the crush and helath and safety was questionable. The building is impressive but not a scratch on modern stadiums. The amenities are poor and dated.",
          "Bought 1 adult ticket for 20\u20ac (discounted with Berlin welcome card )and my two kids went free from the hertha Berlin store at the bottom level at Haupbahnhof station- we got the subway (v busy) and exited to the right (best tip when busy as takes you to the main area by the",
          "Fascinating tour lots of history involved from our tour guide Wiebka who was excellent and funny. Lots of history knowledge and touring the stadium changing rooms and hertha berlin was right up my street. Very informative for history and/or football fans recommended",
          "We were shown round by the guide and she was fantastic. I enjoyed the tour immensely and would recommend to anyone.",
          "We toured today and were very keen to hear about the venue's fascinating and very important history. Instead, we were shown the soccer team changing rooms, VIP rooms and dining areas. The Nazi era history was largely sidestepped. Much of the surrounding area was ignored",
          "I had the pleasure of watching the European Championships here and found the stadium almost overwhelming. The history is palpable, but it also functions brilliantly as a stadium and for me is better than even the London Olympic Stadium. Getting to the stadium is straightforward",
          "Famous stadium with great history. It\u2019s located a little bit away from center but you can approach via metro. You will need at least an hour to explore it well. The ticket for the tour is cheap (5 \u20ac with berlin welcome card).",
          "It was great being able to wander around this amazing place, taking in all the areas. The Olympic swimming pool was in use despite looking a little run down. The stadium was definitely worth visiting.",
          "Highly recommend this tour which takes you into private locations of the Stadium that you won't normally get to see. Our guide Thomas was very knowledgeable and informative.",
          "Great combination between the current use of HSBC and the history of the Olympic stadion in 1936. It's worth the visit!",
          "The Olympia stadium is a bit out of centre (whatever that is in Berlin), But it certainly is worth the visit. Thanks to the WM 2006 the stadium looks wonderfull. Also the Olympic pool is still there (not as pretty, but it has more character).",
          "We checked when there was English guided tour, and paid only 3 EUR more each person to have a very wonderful 1-hour tour with a good English speaking guide Alex. He was very informative, and showed us many rooms and VIP lounges inside. Very very worth to try. Check the time",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed a one hour guided tour of the stadium. You are informed about the feats of Jessie Owens at the 36 Olympics, Usain Bolt's 9.58 100 metres in 2009. Also the home of Hertha Berlin FC. We sat in the VIP seats, dressing rooms etc. The tour was only 9 Euros if",
          "You can feel the past of both sporting events and historical events as you walk round this whole site. From the outside, much of the structure has the same appearance as it did in the 1930s with a modern roof. It is not difficult to imagine being back in those times. You can",
          "Well it was easy to get a ticket and quite cheap compared to other athletics events (such as London) and the transport links are good. The toilets are a bit of a shambles and are not enough. My main issue is that they took our totally empty water bottle off us at \u2018security\u2019",
          "This monumental venue was built for the Olympic games of 1936, which in itself is a reason enough to go and see... With the memory of Jesse Owens still around, winning 4xgold and dismounting the Nazi myth of Aryan supremacy. We were there for the concert of the Rolling Stones,",
          "Great venue. Easy to get to from Berlin on the train. (Bit of a squash at peak but nothing if you are use to London!) Felt like a roomy and comfortable venue. Definitely worth seeing an event here if you have the opportunity",
          "From the football point of view, the stadium is incredibly basic. As it doesn't belong to a team (Hertha Berlin rents it but it isn't theirs) there isn't the history you would find in a stadium like Anfield or the Juventus stadium. Basically we went as it was where Italy won the",
          "From outward appearances this doesn't look much and it doesn't look very appealing, in a rather run-down area. However we had a guided tour in English and our guide was excellent with excellent knowledge. Excellent even for non-sports fans.",
          "The stadium is big and clean. The only problem is that i wished they wouldn't allow smoking in there. It is so torturing for non-smokers.",
          "The sheer size of this stadium is awesome, it is hard to believe that this was built in the 1930\u2019s. it is a magnificent stadium and well worth visiting",
          "An interesting experience to see, especially those parts of a stadium most never get to see. We did the English tour and our guide was good as well as patient with the slower members of the group. Definitely worth seeing if time permits when in Berlin and an easy train ride",
          "The visit to the Olympic stadium was one of the highlights of our trip to Berlin. I've not bothered to go before but my two sons wanted to go and it was well worth it. We did the guided tour which gave us access to the inner parts of the stadium including VIP areas and",
          "The stadium itself is fantastic to go and see and is really impressive. You also get a feel for the history of the place. However be aware that tours in June/July may be disrupted by concert set-up, as this restricts where you can go, changes the view significantly and means you",
          "The olympiastadion is humongous . It is really beautiful but you should visit this stadium only if you have a lot of time in Berlin .",
          "The stadium with all its grandeur has of course a very controversial history. Still it's nice to see it blends very well in current times being the home stadium of Herta and the day to day use of the olympic swimming pool.",
          "An excellent tour and our guide was very knowledgeable and funny. Spoke about the history, the Olympics and it\u2019s current use as a football stadium and concert venue. I\u2019d recommend a visit here",
          "When I\u2019m away for a city break I usually try and take in a stadium tour. As I was in Berlin I thought I\u2019d do the the Hertha Berlin tour. I went along on the day to do the Hertha tour after checking their website, on arrival I was told that as there was a gig on a few days later",
          "Saw Beyonce and J-Z, felt amazing to watch them in this giant stadium. I wouldn't go there just to see the stadium itself.",
          "We just walked around the stadium area.The stadium itself is very nice and looks quite modern.Getting through to the staff is quite hard and is the only place we had this problem in Berlin.I was quite surprised to see one of the streets named (Jesse Owens Allee) I suppose it is",
          "The stadium looks beautiful from the outside, but I didn\u2019t actually have the chance to tour it, and my experience of dealing with the employees was underwhelming. There were a few minor incidents, which culminated at the moment when I entered the visitor's centre and asked for",
          "I've been to the Olympic Stadium several time, cause it's the stadium where the German Football Cup Final (DFB Pokal) is. Honestly: walking towards the stadium from the underground and getting a glimps of the olympic rings and the huge stadium in the background gives me",
          "I really like this stadium, it is now very modern but it retains its history and charm. It has a good atmosphere on match days, it is well set out with good unobstructed views of the pitch. The catering is good with plenty of places to eat and drink. The stadium itself is well",
          "I went just to see the stadium on one of the English-language tours. It took some 60 minutes, of which 30 were lost on unrelated issues, small talk, etc. It is an imposing structure with many hidden nooks, etc, yet we did not see much, and spent the last 15 minutes or so",
          "Giving is 5 stars. Bit wish there had been a bit more information and signs just to say where to get tickets. Did find the ticket booth in the end. We arrived about 45mins before it was closing. Still made most of the the stadium. Very nice stadium to walk around and it ain't",
          "My sister and I visited the Olympiastadion last week to see Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z live. There was quite a lot of confusion surrounding the bag policy and we called the stadium to make sure what it is. We also asked if there are any places to eat nearby while we're waiting in line,",
          "The Olympiastadion Berlin was built between 1934-1936 during the Hitler regime for hosting the summer Olympic Games of 1936 ; it has 55,000 seats,all covered with a roof and is even now on the list of five stars stadiums of FIFA ,the international football federation ; it is",
          "Certainly a night to remember. A fantastic concert in a wonderful stadium. A truly electrifying event that the whole family very much enjoyed. Beyonce is a must see event if you can",
          "Well worth seeing, better than most staduims. You can also check out the swimming pools too which are very intersting.",
          "If you ever get the chance to walk around this area do it! The stadium is amazing a piece of history. The design is open top partialy covered. The stairs are ok after a few times though they get to you find the elevator its small from what i heard.",
          "Not just for football fans, an impressive building full of history.our guide was very good in explaining the symbolism and relevance of the building",
          "We took the highlights tour in English, which was good and would have been enjoyed even if we had been locals. Most of us weren't or we wouldn't have needed an English tour. Yes, we got to see some areas which were closed off to the general public but the emphasis was generic",
          "Went to see Rolling Stones June 22, 2018. I was impressed how huge this stadium is. I couldn't tell from outside. Also it was full house and everything went very smoothly.",
          "The stadium is impressive from the outside but even more so once you enter the building. A triumph between old and new. My visit was not perfect due to the upcoming rolling Stones Concert as some areas were off limits. However the guide was very informative and still managed to",
          "Went to see the Rolling Stones here at it a very atmospheric arena. Drinks were only available outside the arena and as usual were very pricey. Pint of beer and a bottle of water \u20ac14 (it did include two plastic stones beakers)",
          "Knowing this stadium was built for the 1936 Olympics and German propaganda it is very interesting to see it in its present glory. While they have removed the overhang platform where the Fuhrer sat during the games, the overall stadium is really impressive. The interior rooms",
          "Went to see guns and roses here. Great stadium great transportation links. Plenty of food and drinks kiosks",
          "This stadium was far better before it was altered for the World Cup, it carried history now it's just another football stadium.",
          "I came here 11 years' ago and it was great, you could walk around the historic sites on the site but have been back twice now to show the family and entry has been either denied or is via a long tour which does not take in the history - only football. What a waste of time - no",
          "Really interesting place to see, very easy to find it and it is worth for it. It is better to visit it in good weather.",
          "Stadium is very easy to reach from the city by train or subway. We took subway which has a stop at the stadium site. Sports History is abound in the arena and we took a very nice tour led by a tour guide pointing out all the points of interest and history along the way. Very",
          "While our day tour did not go inside, nonetheless, this is an amazing site! So much history has been here. All I could think of was Jesse Owens winning the race and Adolf Hitler watching it!",
          "We visited the Olympiastadion by underground and from there it is a short walk from the station. The stadium is awe inspiring even after all these years. There are guided tours or you can just wander around on your own. Well worth a visit.",
          "This Nazi-style architecture shows the prowess of Hitlers regime. While we didn't venture into the stadium, the stadium is an effigy of everything created with the stolen Jew wealth. If you don't venture to this part of the city; the U-baan then give this one a miss.",
          "The Olympiastadion is in the northern part of the city, thus somewhat off the usual tourist trek. You can visit it conveniently via U-Bahn, to be impressed by overpowering Nazi style architecture adapted for modern use. It's best to visit it for a Hertha BSC football match, if",
          "Visited here to watch Guns and Roses. Nice stadium with lots of space outside. Seating not too bad and reasonably comfortable for a 3 hour gig. We stayed at a hotel within walking distance but stadium does have its own S-bahn station. Getting in was pretty easy and security",
          "One of the most gorgeous football stadiums, includes a running track, a sports center facility and many more amenities that make it worth a visit. With various smaller stadiums on the surroundings, and a public swimming pool, it is truly a sports paradise.",
          "A Fantastic Olympic Arena. About fifteen minutes train journey out side Berlin. A fantastic Add for Jessie Owen. The Olympic Arena looks really smart especially without the swasticas on the great pillars as you go to the entrance1",
          "Myself and my16 year old grandson (he is football mad !) took the English tour of the stadium with guide Yana. She was very knowledgeable about the whole history of the stadium. We were not able to see the whole pitch as work was in progress erecting a stage for a Guns N'",
          "Huge stadium. Partial underground with good acoustic. Suggested for concerts and athletic games. Nice transportation with many store and clean restrooms.",
          "What a nice place to feel the history and have to take in the great german atmosphere! The stadium is a grand design as a building and the two columns front of it just make it unbelievable great. Do not miss it!",
          "The English tour was amazing, the iconic shape and the important history of the stadium brought to life by the guide. About 90 minute tour that takes you deep underground to see the magnitude of the structure. Did this 4 years previously but enjoyed it just as much the second",
          "We visited 4 days before a concert and as a result the pitch and track had been covered and the stage was under preparation. However on arriving we were not informed of this or that we would not be allowed to wander round at leisure. As a result we paid 24 euros for an hours",
          "We looked forward to visiting this stadium but there was match planned, so we couldn't do the tour. Book in advance if you can! Also, if possible visit it by sunset, it's beautiful to see the sun behind the iconic olympic rings. Look up the historic significance of this",
          "Visited this den of political and sporting history and was definitely wowed. Easy to get to by public transport - we took train direct from Friedrichstrasse to the stadium (S9). It is a rare sight with its colosseum-like structure built by Hitler (actually Hitler just ordered",
          "Came here to watch Berlin Vs Dortmund in the Bundesliga (tickets so easy to buy online). Great piece of political and sporting history. German fans are among the best out there for noise and atmosphere. Easy to get to on the metro.",
          "Visited for last game of the season v leipzig, good stadium with easy transport links on the u bahn, plenty of places to eat and drink once inside the complex , no restricted seating views , if you are going to watch a game buy tickets in advance online from hertha website and",
          "The stadium still used today is a great living history to the Olympic Games of 1936. Climb the tower for a great birds eye view of the stadium and indeed the city of Berlin. A very reasonable entrance fee of 8 euros (free with Berlin Card) to visit the site. Walk around the",
          "Worth a visit just to see the dedication to the gold medal winners of the 1936 Olympics and Jessie Owens tremendous achievements. And then if you're a football fan, there so much more!",
          "Went here in the morning. Already open. No team can be seen excersising, however the experience to be in Olimpiade stadium is amazing. Can buy souvenirs at the shop but a little bit expensive for me. However if you are a soccer fans then you must go here",
          "We went here after going to Charlottenburg Palace as it looked near on the map. We got a combination of buses and trains and eventually arrived. It's very near the metro. It was a gloomy day and getting dark so the building was very atmospheric. Our timing was poor as there",
          "Attended a Hertha BSC game and enjoyed the stadium & atmosphere. Some fans were smoking near us at times which wasn\u2019t appreciated, but I would see another game or visit again if given the opportunity. Stadium is very accessible from subway line U2.",
          "a great structure - although we only saw from outside as a football match the previous day meant the stadium was not open until later in the day when it was to be made presentable",
          "We took the u bahn to it. Bit of a walk from station. Massive stone stadium designed by Hitler. . Very impressive. Also the swimming pool remains from the 1936 Olympic Games in Hitlers uprising.",
          "This was a fantastic visit and not to be missed .We took the guided tour in English which was splendid .For anyone interested in the Third Reich ,architecture ,the Olympics or football this is a must . Very easy access by S or U Bahn from all areas of Berlin .",
          "I took a tour in English of the Olympic Stadium of Berlin. The tour guide was very knowledgable and the tour was extensive and we got to see many aspects of the stadium. The was reference to the problematic history of the place which I appricated. Anyone interested in history,",
          "Unbelievable to stand at the stadium and consider the history that has unfolded here. One of the olympic stadiums to see. Much better than even the great Colosseum of LA. Amphitheater or parts of still here as is part of pool and diving board. Easy access from S9 station.",
          "Family visit with our 12 years old football mad son, we watched a Hertha Berlin game against Wolfsberg. The stadium is an amazing piece of architectural design, its worth walking around the stadium to get an understanding of how big the stadium is, we never did the tour, but",
          "Highly recommend the tour spoken by fantastic fluent English speaker who was well informed and gave a great blend of sport info and historical background given the origins of this famous stadium. Really interesting and worth waiting for and paying for the guide.",
          "A place with lots of history, plus is a really cool landmark to visit. A bit out of the city centre, but definitely worth the trip. I believe there's a U-bahn station there, however we travelled by coach as we were part of a tour group. Those who get to watch Beyonce here later",
          "Well worth a trip out to the stadium if you are staying in Berlin. Transport links are great and getting there is easy. The English tour guide was brilliant with loads of facts about the building, the history and modern day improvements.",
          "Went with a friend to visit Berlin for a weekend. Incidentally the Bundesliga kicked off on that weekend, so we went to watch Hertha BSC Berlin face off against VfB Stuttgart. The euphoria is pretty great when the home team wins. It is a great stadium, looks really imposing and",
          "The stadium actually only hints at its past and when it was built and when inside, although it is large and impressive, that is the same for most stadia. Obviously there are reasons why some of its history is not overtly discussed, but I think it undersells itself",
          "I went here with friends to watch Hertha Berlin play, and was very impressed with how football supporters are treated in comparison to the UK. There were plenty of eating and drinking places outside the stadium, all reasonably priced. On entering the stadium grounds, there is",
          "Forever associated with the Berlin Olympics, and despite its associations with the Nazi regime, this is a must visit for the sheer scale and scope of it and the historical significance too. Great acoustics considering when built but surprisingly small from the inside.",
          "This was amazing and lots to photograph , lots of history about the stadium and surrounding areas . Great sculptures and a nice restaurant area to visit after all the walking . You can also have a guided tour but we chose to do our own trip.",
          "We visited thus during our stay in Berlin. The main stadium itself is quite interesting, as is the older parts which I would recommend to anyone interesting in history as it is where the 1936 Berlin Olympics was held.",
          "While on a break we explored the Olympiastadion because of the history of the place. My boys just wanted to visit a German Football stadium. The size is impressive and the underground transport to this worked very well.",
          "A great day out for all ages!! Very interesting and got to explore all the stadium. I have beem twice now and can't wait to return in the summer!! Highly reccomend!!!",
          "Easy access to this landmark by train Free entry with the Berlin Pass Spectacular place even when empty as lots of history also has the Olympic stadium built for the 1916 Olympic Games and the Swimming & diving Pools used in the 1936 Olympic Games. Well worth a visit",
          "We visited the olympiastadion on a dark, cold January night for Hertha Berlin v Borussia Dortmund. The place is just full of history and the ghosts of the past. Even though it was full of football fans you can still get a feel for the place, the structure itself is obviously",
          "We have been to a Hertha match which was amazing. When you are walking in the stadium you still feel like you are in 1936 due to its monumentalism. Worth a visit but only if you combine with an event.",
          "I'd been to Berlin 4 times but this was the first trip to the Olympiastadion. This may sound like a cliche but this is one of the few places where you can actually feel the tangible presence of history. From the VIP box where Hitler would have watched Jesse Owens win his 4",
          "This was something I wanted to visit purely because of its importance in history with the games. The time it was an Olympic stadium and of course the legendary Jesse Owens winning 4 Golds made this a place to visit. It was very impressive, a huge amount of land with lots",
          "This 1 hour tour was very good, it talks both about the Olympics that have been held there, mostly talking about it in the nazi regime but also a lot about the football club that plays here. We booked it online and for a discounted student price, however accidentally booked the",
          "This is more a visit to stand in the place of greats and not so greats and imagine a time gone by. Worth a visit.",
          "Stunning stadium . Tours in English well worth while, very interesting. New S Bahn station saves a long walk from the U Bahn station.",
          "A fantastic stadium full of history. It is well worth going on the guided tour of the stadium exploring the VIP areas, the balcony used by Adolf Hitler during the 1936 Olympic Games, the tunnel area, changing rooms and indoor warm up area as used by Usain Bolt. The stadium has",
          "We went on the English guided tour and was worth the 8 euros we paid! Saw everything in a different light underneath the stadium grounds. Learning the history behind the stadium and how Germany played their part in the Olympic games",
          "The stadium is a few stations trip from the centre but it is well worth visiting. I would recommend joining the English language tour as more can be learned about the place. The stadium itself is unique in that its imposing outside remains original from the 1930s and the inside",
          "We cycled out to the stadium using the well marked bike lanes. The stadium, swimming pool and parade field was incredibly imposing, it really made the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end as you thought about events that took place here in the past. Around the site were",
          "Beware, this closes at 3.30pm not 4pm as stated! I turned up at 3.33pm and there was a fella from American who had been knocking on the door from exactly 3.30pm but they came out and told us all waiting we couldnt go in because they'd turned the machines off - people were still",
          "Finally got to visit the complex on my third trip to Berlin. The stadium is easy to access from the S3, S5, S7, and S9 trains. I wanted to see Hertha BSC play, but unfortunately they were off and had a special event for Marcelinho Paraiba who was retiring at the end of the",
          "I would recommend the stadium tour to anyone that wants to go and see this stadium as it is a very good experience and walking around it and in the VIP rooms and the changing rooms gives you a greater idea of how big it is and how simple yet complex the design is of the stadium!",
          "This is a piece of history of sports, it is the same stadium of the Olympics of 1936 (do you remember Jesse Owens?), as an Italian, it is as well the unforgettable pitch of the 2006 World Cup Final.",
          "My second visit to the football stadium. Although it was a friend match, but people were enjoying. Fans supported their club with jerseyes or club hymns. The compliments of the offensive / defensive actions but also the critics of the passes or shots to football gate was heard",
          "one of the worlds most iconic sports grounds i know a lot of german football fans are not keen on this place but it is an absolute amazing place. historically in tact",
          "this (empty) stadium and concidering, when it was built is worth going there. Good for just in between two other POI.",
          "Nicely decorated stadium. The staff explains the main things about the stadium. It is worth to take away advertisements because there are discounts for other attractions in Berlin",
          "Couldn't go inside, but had to visit for the history. Looks old and nearly abandoned from the outside which does not match some of these pictures I see of the inside.",
          "Stadium is easy to access via public transport. We took the English guided tour which lasted about 70 minutes. There was so much history to take in it was quite overwhelming but our guide was very informative. Highly recommend doing this attraction whilst in Berlin.",
          "This stadium by far exceeds expectations. Excellent layout. Close to Berlin city center. Easy commute(taxi,bus or metro). Staff very helpful and efficient. Seats comfy. I belive that this stadium competes with Camp Nou and the Bernabeu. The only annoying part is that ur not",
          "I personally came here as I done 6 years of German history at school and was fascinated to learn the stadium was still standing. We stayed by the Berlin zoo and were about 20 minutes from the zoo station to the stadium. The stadium is beside the station and is \u20ac8 pp for access.",
          "I guess if you are into sports and the Olympics then you have to visit! I do and loved it. I love the stadium and it\u2019s architecture it was amazing. The pools are still in use which was nice to see. It was about 30 minutes by underground from Potsdamer plas. If your here for a",
          "Although the history of the 1936 games is controversial, the place is legendary. I visit the Athletics meet every September and have bought tickets for the European Championships for August 2018. Tours are available but you can also just come and walk around or get tickets to a",
          "Using the bus and Ubann this was a long way out of the center. The stadium was tremendous and the Jesse Owen plaque amazing.",
          "we where at the opening of it, it was gret, than we visited the plase twice and it where very impresing",
          "What to expect: We visited the site during the late morning. We took the U2 subway to the site. We exited the train with only a few other people. We strolled past a large sign the suggested that the stadium was up the path. (We could not see the stadium at this point) when we",
          "I really wanted to get to the stadion while in Berlin so I went to a Hertha's game. Unfortunately Hertha didn't win, but the fans put a lot of support and the atmosphere was amazing. Eventhough it was raining and it was cold the stadion was almost full so if you want to have",
          "Visited here in March took tour of stadium very interesting easy to get to by metro the ground around are huge well worth a visir",
          "From Nazi Germany to the modern times this stadium has really stood the test of time as an iconic stadium in Europe. The original 1930s architecture is still there\u2019s but is mixed with a modern twist. The history from the 1936 Berlin olympics to the 2006 Germany World Cup is",
          "The Berlin experience has been great. On day 2, I went on the English tour of the Olympiastadion and it was the highlight of the trip so far. The history of the entire area is visible and palpable. Highly recommended.",
          "A truly memorable visit and worth going with an expert guide. The building succeeds in projecting the strength and solidity that was intended in its design and the relatively recent addition of a part-roof does not detract from that. We also visited the German forces memorial",
          "Now the home of Hertha Berlin FC. We went to watch them play Hamburg and the atmosphere was superb. Get there early and wander round the site and be transported back to the 1930's. Lots of information points to ponder over. Top tip...wear a good coat as it can be a bit blowy",
          "Had a guided tour which was really interesting. Get to see all the interesting bits under the stadium including training area, changing rooms, vip areas... Guide was well informed and provided some interesting info about its history. Worth having a walk round the whole park.",
          "We visited with the intention of going on the 1hr English tour only to find it fully booked - should have booked ahead! We instead paid to walk around by ourselves. The stadium is impressive and steeped in history. There is a lot of information around explaining about its",
          "We booked on line before we visited, you can buy tickets on the day but when we went the tours were fully booked so I would book in advance if you can. Entry is \u20ac8 for a self guided tour where you can wander freely or \u20ac12 for a guided tour which lasts just over and hour. The",
          "In the west district of Berlin , visit this historic Stadium , since from 1936 outside , but inside modern style.....",
          "Even though the stadium is a little out of town it is definitely worth a visit when you think about the history of the 1936 Olympics and Jesse Owens\u2019 gold medals and the fact that Bolt broke the 100m record on that track. You can also get quite close to the track for some good",
          "Came to see a game here while on a break. Great people and great atmosphere. Very reasonably priced for drink and food, great history around the place also. Easy to get to on the train also and only a short walk from the station to the venue",
          "I don't follow any sports, but came to the stadium because of its historical importance regarding Jesse Owens and Adolf Hitler. The tour is well worth it, and you get to visit what is left of Hitler's box . Jesse Owens won 4 gold medals here and his success is enshrined on a",
          "We did the 1 hour guided tour and it was fantastic. You get the history of the stadium and it\u2019s role in the Reich and you go behind the scenes into the VIP boxes, the locker room, the Jesse Owens lounge and other. Very worthwhile. Easy to get to by taking the S5 to",
          "Bit of a trek but well worth the visit \u20ac8 entry for a wander round in your own time Other tours inc guides/audio available Very impressive place steeped in history Immaculate and little appears to have changed since its inception and 1936 Olympic Games Stone inscriptions to",
          "This was so enjoyable. My kids got to learn about so many different sides of Berlin's history just by going through the complete tour. Highly recommend the complete tour if you have the time because it takes you to so many parts of the stadium you can't go to otherwise.",
          "It is a typical stadium except for the history it invokes. Worth taking a tour so the history comes alive.",
          "I went to the Hertha v Bayern Munich game last weekend and was amazed at this unique stadium. I've been to plenty of Germsn grounds, but all are purpose built football stadia, but this one is different. From the approach towards the Olympic Rings hanging above the entrance, to",
          "Great seats, relatively clean, great atmosphere, great matches, fun time! If you have some time beforehand go to the Glockenturm. A short ride with a elevator takes you up to a platform where you can overlook the entire Olympia Stadium and it's fields and surrounding areas.",
          "A guided tour may be better but we walked around and found plenty of information on plaques in english giving good background information.",
          "You will need a lot of imagination to make this pace worthwhile from a historical perspective. It's basically a big football stadium now.",
          "We visited recently, we went on the tour of the stadium rather than just accessing the site. The tour was interesting, the guide provided a lot of detail and explanation of the history of the stadium and how it\u2019s used nowadays.",
          "Beautiful stadium, you have to view it from the bell tower....you can see the whole park and all the venues.",
          "What a truly wonderful tour of this historic old stadium. From the moment the tour starts, you learn about the history of it being built, somehow not being bombed in the war, Jesse Owens winning his medals right up to the current day. It takes you into the stands, to the pitch",
          "Very reasonably priced and a wonderful, militant stadium structure. I was particular interested in seeing this stadium in all it's glory as this is where Italy won the 2006 World Cup, which was a tournament I loved! Will be back to see a game here hopefully.",
          "Lovely stadium, full of history. \u20ac8 entry is a bargain. Guided tour is excellent. Few miles outside town so take the train. They are also frequent and cheap if you get a Berliner pass.",
          "take the u-bahn and visit the stadium. its is amazing and the area surrounding well presented. only costs E8 so worth every penny. its a piece of olympic history not to be missed while in Berlin",
          "during off season, its 8 euro to get in without guide. take the bahn train there would be the most convenient way",
          "this was the high point of my visit to Berlin. Absolutely loved every minute there and Claudia who gave our Guided tour was excellent",
          "I would visit this stadium to see a Hertha Berlin game. The fans are fantastic, the tickets are affordable and attainable. The capacity is 75,000 and they rarely sell out. Make sure to get a Bratwurst and Beer (~6) outside the stadium, though you will have to finish them before",
          "We stopped by the stadium as a part of our hop on hop off bus tour. The visit was of interest as it explains not only the building of the stadium but also how Hitler used the event as a way to propagandize his assumption to power.",
          "Must see whilst in Berlin! Particularly as an Olympic fan! Some great history here. We did an English talk which was worth doing, you get to go into the VIP areas and slightly onto the pitch",
          "I am not necessarily interested in sports, but touring (self) the Reichsportfeld constructed by Hitler for the 1936 Olympics was the highlight of my trip to Berlin. Though the stadium has been upgraded on the inside, the outside still says 1936 as does the Nazi Era statuary",
          "Historic stadium in Berlin. Its very well maintained . You will have to walk for long within the stadium",
          "If you are into WWII history, this is a must see! This Olympic Stadium is not only beautifully preserved; some of it is actually still in use. During our visit there were kids and adults alike swimming in the pools and using the diving boards. The stadium retains its",
          "The stadium was built in 1936 by Hitler and the Nazis to showcase their supremacy during the Olympic games. Currently it is still being used as a soccer stadium and still hosts various track and field games. Worth a look and I highly recommend taking the guided tour (you will",
          "Booked the tour while we were still in the uk. Accidentally booked the German language tour but was able to change at the stadium. So watch out for that. If you get the Berlin welcome pass you get a discount. We had a walk round the stadium before the tour while waiting. The",
          "Amazing stadium built by Hitler that is as strong as when it was built. It is great to see they have modified (to an extent) the football stadium so Hertha Berlin can use it. The pool and hockey grounds are still in use. The view from the bell tower is pretty impressive and",
          "We booked onto an English guided tour of the stadium. Our guide was very knowledgeable and provided many informative and interesting facts about the history, renovation, and present use of the stadium. The tour guide took us around the inside of the stadium, giving lots of",
          "Berlin hosted the 1936 Olympic Games and a number of contemporary sporting events. I hope they bring back the Olympics in Berlin.",
          "Incredible! We stayed at the Westin Grand Berlin and took the Subway (U) very easy to get too. Plan at least a 1/2 day if not more time.",
          "When you first walk up the the stadium you can be forgiven for thinking it looks a bit old and lacking in grandiose. However, as we found out via a tour, they have kept as much of the structure as it was for the 1936 games. It is a fascinating area, not just the stadium, but the",
          "We visited the stadium and decided to pay extra to do the guided tour. This was worthwhile doing and only cost an an extra \u20ac3 each. The guide (Edith)was very friendly and happy to answer any questions. The history attached to the stadium was very interesting. Excellent way to",
          "As well as being a football stadium, it has a wealth of history behind it and the guided tour is very informative",
          "We went to the stadium for a U2 concert this July. We made the mistake of taking a cab from the Brenderburg gate thinking that it will be a long walk to the stadium from the station. We realised after the concert that the train station was just outside the stadium and we could",
          "We decided to visit the stadium today. The tour was really interesting and informative and lasted an hour. Time was given to take photos and the tour guide was very friendly. I would definitely recommend doing this during a visit to Berlin and for \u20ac11 each it's s bargain",
          "I came here to watch liverpool play Hertha Berlin and it was great. Took a while to get there from the train station because of the crowds but, the crowd was buzzing and staff were helpful. So many places also to purchase food and drink.",
          "During my visit to Berlin I had the opportunity to visit the stadium and also assist the Fussball Bundesliga Match Hertha Berlin vs. VfB Stuttgart 2:0. Too bad for my home town city club. The stadium is very nice and has a big history, especially around the 1936 Olympic games",
          "You can see the stadium from a sporting point of view and also as the home of the British military during the Cold War which is great and of course there's a lot of history from the Second World War associated with the place. Best of all though is the view from the belltower.",
          "Very easy to get to on the U-Bahn as it has its on station. The walk up from the U-Bahn gives you an impressive view of the Stadium. Easy to access and enter. We just paid standard entrance fee and explored on our own. The DFB German Cup memorabilia came as a nice surprise",
          "I was here for a football match, and I could never have imagined how huge the stadium is. It is breathtakingly large, and the atmosphere was amazing.",
          "A surprising amount of the stadium and surrounding estate was accessible for a relatively small price. Considering that this is now an eighty year old stadium it feels modern and appears to offer good views of the pitch area from all seats. A roof has been added but in general",
          "We booked a 1 hour English speaking tour when visiting Berlin with our Grandsons (12 & 14) as they are both Football fans. It is great value at \u20ac25 for a family ticket. The stadium is easy to reach using the U & S Bahn lines and is about 35 minutes from Alexanderplatz. The Day",
          "Great tour - highly recommended. I arrived about 45 minutes early and walked around the entire stadium. I think I paid about 15 euro for the tour. I learned a tremendous amount from the tour guide. We got to see the field, press box area, locker rooms, underground area and a bit",
          "Only saw it on a bus in drive by. Rather far out, so do it on a hop on hop off bus, or some other tour bus. If your not interested in the 36 history, I wouldn't recommend it.",
          "Went on a rainy day. Decided not to take the tour. Interesting visit. Could go up into the seating areas and walk around the outside of the stadium. The swimming pool at the back plus the diving pool. Ok, but not necessarily worth the money to get in.",
          "I visited approximately 1 hour after the attraction opened and it was very quiet, which was great. I travelled there using the S bahn and the station is approximately 150 yards walk. It was great to see the Olympic Rings suspended above the entrance. I also saw the pitch/",
          "It was a great place to visit. To see the rings suspended between the two towers - images you have seen in history - still there was amazing. Definitely worth visiting. Going early allows you the ability to take pictures without groups in the picture!",
          "a very nice stadium, one of the bests in the world ! quite enjoyable tour through the facilities of the stadium, nice guides and the place where you should attend at least 1 football match",
          "I don't think this is much of a must-see while in Berlin. We only visited the outside of the park and did not go into the stadium.",
          "This was a fantastic old stadium to see. Easy to get to on the underground. We bought a travel pass so jumped on and off all day. We walked all around the stadium saw the old Olympic swimming pool and other areas behind the stadium. Very small to today's pool's and venue's. This",
          "Like many attractions in Berlin, the stadium is a unique combination of the old and the new. As such, the Olympiastadion has a Roman-esque architecture, while simultaneously functioning as an ultra-modern sports and music stadium to rival anywhere in the world. We ended up",
          "We arranged for an English speaking tour and we were so glad we did!!! Our guide was excellent, and we got to see many parts of the venue and hear so many stories that we simply would not have known about. With the recent movie Race, it was neat to see where the athletes",
          "Just back from a week in Berlin. Took up the option of buying the 3 day Berlin Pass. Great value if you are willing to put in the hours to visit as many places as possible. If you want a relaxed pace not sure you would get value for money. In my opinion the best attraction was",
          "Went twice to the stadium. Saw U2 there one night and took the official tour the next day. So much history in this place as it was the site of the 1936 Olympics where Jesse Owens won Gold. It was also the place where, many years later, Usain Bolt shattered the 100m record and",
          "I had a 1 hour overview tour of the Stadium, in English. The guide was fantastic: informative, humorous, with evidently very detailed background knowledge of the Stadium and its roles in the context of Berlin's and Germany's history.",
          "Was there Saturday evening for a Hertha game - the pitch was in great condition, a nice friendly crowd of around 55,000 people and the stadium is just amazingly historic. Yes, the beer / hot dog lines are a bit slow at halftime but what can one expect with that many people",
          "Had an amazing time here lots to see and do. The swimming pool was still opened and there was people in it using the diving board.",
          "I recently toured Berlin's Olympic Stadium. Our tour guide was excellent! She was very informative and energetic. The stadium is impressive both in structure and in history. I appreciate how they preserved the original outside structure and made improvements and modernized the",
          "I led a group of college students to the U.K. and Germany to study WWII. One of the things we did in Berlin was to take a stadium tour to examine propaganda and the grandiose visions of the 1936 olympics. Our guide, Elisabeth, was amazing. She spoke both English and German",
          "Lovely tour around this stadium the tour guide was very informative and funny! Amazing to see hitlers balcony and where he made his speeches at the Olympics.. Like most of Berlin and Germany this place is steeped in history. Great Tour!",
          "Some of the old and historic combined with new and modern. The sheer size of the stadium is inspiring. In order to feel the full impact I suggest you know a little about the history of the stadium before going. It's an easy subway ride out.",
          "This is a must-see if you are visiting Berlin. An easy U-ban journey takes you here and a 500m walk to the main entrance of the stadium. Have a look around this magnificent sports arena and if you fancy a swim in the open-air pool, then don't forget your swim-wear. The pool",
          "We took the one hour English tour, but would have loved to have been organized enough to take the two-hour tour. We checked on line for tours and times, then bought our tickets at the stadium. Like every place in Berlin, this site is steeped in history, mystery, and controversy.",
          "Arrived 50mins early which worked out really well as chance to walk around the stadium and also into the stadium at our own leisure. English speaking tour guide was great, lots of info on olympics and football but slightly rushed at the end and we never made it to the Olympic",
          "We booked the 60 minute tour and got a discounted price with our Berlin Welcome Card, \u20ac9 instead of \u20ac12. The tour was a good mixture of history and sporting information. Having seen WW2 newsreels of events in the stadium, it was quite unnerving to actually be there.",
          "We booked tickets to have a guided tour around the stadium. We booked the tour online which was easy to do. The stadium itself is very impressive but the tour made the experience so much better. The tour gave an insight behind the scenes showing the VIP box, changing rooms,",
          "Main reason for visiting Berlin was U2 concert on the Olympiastadion. We took U2 from Alexander Platz to see U2 on the Olympiastadion. So happy we decided to go in Berlin, I can feel some special chemistry between U2 & Berlin! Iconic and impressive piece of architecture.",
          "another easy attraction to get to via train or tube.......first thing you see is the two towers holding the olympic rings......but there is so much more.........the history of the place is immense with the 1936 games with jesse owens standing out..........",
          "Visited the stadium on a Saturday morning. It was quiet and we were able to have a good look around without being swamped by other tourists. There was a coffee shop and prices were reasonable. The stadium's design is typical of the era - stark and imposing. Stone tablet",
          "I am a sports fan and I am really into events like Olympic Games and World cup. Only imaging Messi has been here already makes me excited! It is 6 miles away from the museum island and took me 40 mins to take the public tranportation there. The ticket office is almost",
          "We visited purely for the U2 Joshua Tree Tour in July 2017. We've seen U2 at lots of places, and the Olympiastadion was one of the best. Sure it's huge, and any performers are going to appear as tiny ants; but you could also feel the sense of history and admire the way they",
          "I was in the city to see U2 perform. The stadium is beautiful, but it would have been better if poor Bono hadn't gotten soaking wet while he wooed the crowd of thousands of people. The stadium still sports its Olympic symbols which make it unique.",
          "Only visiting for this unique concert but enjoyed the arena as playground for me and thousand other rock-.fans. Always well organised and clean. Always easy to find ways to arrive and travel safe back to hotell",
          "One of the most Historic Olympic Stadiums in the world. Old world. Glass Ceiling. Super. We saw a concert, Marvellous Experience",
          "Whilst I did not take the stadium tour or see the museum, the stadium was very accessible and is an extremely impressive sight. A great place for a concert!",
          "A large stadium from 1936 Olympics. Olympic Ring Columns stand over entrance. Tried to imagine that Hitler walked through those gates. Jessie Owens triumph was won here. Great history to reflect on what was here. Easy trip on train.",
          "The entry was really fast even with more security control! Toilets be ok at the beginning (we don't talk about the Dixis)\ud83d\ude02 Staff was friendly prices for beer 0.5 was 5 \u20ac and cocktails 8\u20ac and always 2\u20ac deposit! The stage even if you stand it front was far away and you don't see",
          "Wow I am still impressed by the architecture and the size of this Stadium. Where history meets the present. A guided tour in English is a must. Our tour guide was great and gave us a perfect mixture of facts and numbers and a historical review. Feel it touch it see it. For kids",
          "We went for a concert there. It is really easily accesaible from the city center. It is worth to check the history of the building and find a guided tour to visit it.",
          "My boyfriend and I cycled to the stadium (as it is further out of the centre than other attractions). I recommend doing this. We paid to go inside the stadium (it is fairly cheap). The stadium is impressive and it was clearly built with a lot of thought and good materials.",
          "We took a 60 min guided English tour, which was really good and informative. We learned a lot about the stadium, its history, and we got to see some of the more closed off areas, than we would have seen walking alone. Unfortunately, we were unable to walk around at the stadium",
          "Went there for the U2 concert. Easy to get to using the S75 which I took from Friedrichstrasse Station. 10 stops, less than 30 mins. Stadium was more comfortable than others I've been too. Only complaint is that when it rains (and it did) there's no sheltered paths from the",
          "Not my first time here, as once again, visited for the Depeche Mode concert. An amazing stadium and steeped in history for that famous Olympic Games with Jesse Owens.It has such atmosphere here and the acoustics for a concert are awesome",
          "After a short walk from the underground station arrived at the reception ready for a hour long tour of what really was Hitler's dream. Having Berlin card it cost 9 \u20ac for the tour. A very informative guide took us around all the main parts of very impressive stadium. We saw the",
          "Wanted to see the stadium but had to go on a tour - that said it was well worth it, lots of history behind the stadium and our guide had plenty of great stories bringing the experience to life. \u20ac8 is great value",
          "Visited the old stadium today with the family, and we absolutely loved it! We found it very interesting finding out all about the history and significance of it and hope that the stadium will still be standing for generations to come. Would absolutely recommend a visit!",
          "Last time we were here there were 70,000 plus other people keeping us company as Coldplay were playing so thought we'd come back and have a wander round when it was empty.Did the self guided tour and just drank in the huge history of this place. If you've got the time it's well",
          "Our visit was on a day with heavy snow so you had to be on a our to enter. So happy that this happened as the tour of the stadium was brilliant, the tour guide gave such depth and pointed out all interesting facts. A really brilliant insight into the transformation of the",
          "Easy to get to via U-bahn and only a good 8 minute walk from the U-bahn, but a nice walk. Really unique looking stadia. We paid \u20ac8.50 (student rate) to get in and we were basically allowed free roam of the stadium, which was slightly unusual but incredible at the same time.",
          "We could have missed this stop, just looked at the building from the outside. This was part of an organized tour.",
          "Visited here on our second day in Berlin and although on the other side of the city it didn't take that long and was well worth the trip.We took the english speaking tour for 11,$ which lasted around seventy minutes or so.The guide was very informative and told about all the",
          "The website for Olympic Stadium tells lies it was not open at 9.00am as stated. The first Engkish speaking tour was 10.30 and you were not allowed to view the stadium on your own. The stadium famous for the 1936 Nazi Olympics, is beautiful and if I had time would have completed",
          "A visit to the Olympic Stadium in Berlin is a walk through history and a testament to the fact that sports brings people together. A self guided tour here is what we chose to do and there are plenty of historical markers and explanation on the grounds to bring the history of",
          "I went here on the way out of Berlin. This is a fantastic stadium and from an architecutural point of view a great piece of architecture. I did not go on the tour as I didnt have time, but there is still informative signs which you can read which will give you an insight.",
          "Not a great sports fan myself we were taken here by German friends and it was really very interesting. We took a quick trip up the tower which is an excellent way to enjoy the all round view but also to get a great look at the stadium itself. There was also some very",
          "I wasn't sure what to expect of this attraction if I'm honest. The website underplays the experience. Maybe that's deliberate. We took the guided tour which I recommend. It takes you to places you can't see if you just wander around by yourself. It is a stunning piece of",
          "It was originally built for the Summer Olympic Games in 1936. Today it's part of Olympiapark in Berlin. Step upstairs and enjoy views with Olympicstadion surroundings by green woods.",
          "easy to get to, on the u bahn red line, this is a good afternoon out. spotlessly clean despite being in regular use. there are guided tours but the English ones are only at certain times. I chose to just tour myself, there are plenty of plaques to read, a shop and the",
          "An absolutely beautiful Stadium to walk around especially with the rest of the Olympic Park. Cost me 8 Euro to get it which is a great price when you consider other stadiums in Europe. My only problem is that they could let you see more. Would be nice to see pitch level,",
          "If you ever have the chance to watch an event at the Olympiastadion then go. I got tickets for the Bundesliga match between Herta Berlin v Borussia Dortmund and was a bit sceptical about watching a football match with a running track around the outside of the pitch. The stadium",
          "Love the stadium, really disappointed with the tour this week. Due to the gymnastics half the stadium was closed off...and they don't tell yoi. Not worth the entrance fee, never got near the pitch or the wall of heroes.",
          "Went here on the spur of the moment. Guided tours only but so interesting. One of the highlights of our visit.",
          "I came here with no special interest in sport but with a lot of interest for history and architecture. I've been disappointed because in a normal Thursday, without any tourist around, the entrance was scheduled as full for groups and individual entrance wasn't allowed. So I just",
          "The stadium is a must see and the history behind it is breathtaking, especially how it has developed over time! Our tour guide was brilliant and very informative, however I felt there was parts of the stadium tour missed. We didn't get to go down to pitch side and get a real",
          "It is worth to go. Both adults and children will enjoy the tour and fan shops. Easy access by U-bahn. No need to book tickets online, as there are no queues ;)",
          "The Stadium is astounding in design and construction though more than 80 years old. There are a few still standing building of the Third Reich, and this is equally impressive to the others. We did not attempt to enter it, but got out of our tour van and walked around with our",
          "This 3rd large German stadium has the original outside but the inside and the roof is so modern and nice. Even if there is an athletic running court around the pitch you can get a quite good view on the entire pitch even from the cheapest places.",
          "did not have the opportunity to go inside but just being there and reliving the memories of this stadium and what it represented in our past was amazing.",
          "Originally designed for the 1936 Summer Olympics by Werner March, today Olympiastadion stands as a restored icon of stadium design and international sport. Back in the dark days of the cold war, the area had an entirely different feel, with British military HQ within the stadium",
          "We were invited to watch the final game of the Bundesliga season - our team, Bayer 04 Leverkusen versus Hertha Berlin. We parked some way away from the stadium and walked the rest of the way with thousands of other soccer fans - 99,9% supporting the home team. The",
          "Leipzig absolutely hammered Hertha on the day. Naby Keita owned the midfield and Hertha looked like they were playing whilst on mogadon. The stadium was magnificent and it is a real treat to be able to drink a nice beer whilst watching a game - we can't do this in the UK",
          "Had an amazing trip to the Stadium with my friend who had not been before and she was quite emotional. Both sport lovers so we felt the significance of the history and the current position of the venue. Great lunch to boot!",
          "We caught the train from Alexanderplatz and arrived at the stadium around 30 minutes. We hadn't managed to book onto the tour, so we wandered around ourselves. What a visit. A humbling visit. So much to see, think about and take it. We would recommend visiting the Stadium",
          "Well worth a visit for football or any Sports fans; along with the historical side of the place. The actual complex is huge. Took the 'overground' train the S5 from the City Centre at Alexanderplatz - which took around 30mins, approx. 9 Euro return, from there for 2. A place",
          "Tremendous place to see which bleeds the history of the so called Nazi Olympics of 1936. Such an imposing place and great that it is still used today for top level sport. Peek round the south side to see the old bell which fell from the tower in an air raid.",
          "the stadium doesn't look so big from the outside, but when you get in it is huge! there are professional guides who make a nice tour of the stadium, lockers and vip lounges.",
          "As we had the Berlin travel pass the tour was only 5 euros. We decided to do the self tour. I honestly could have spent the whole afternoon there. With the self tour you don't get the access to the changing rooms etc....., but you can walk all round the stadium. Outside the",
          "Massive construction, huge of piece of World history. Also the Olympic Park is something to look for. Try to catch a football game on your visit. Would recommend it.",
          "Have been here to watch concerts, to watch sport events and to watch football games.This is a piece of Berlin's history, you should try to see one of the organized events, definitely worth to do!",
          "Easily accessable via public transport. Plenty to see within the grounds and the stadium plus a visual history of the building and its history. The clock tower is an additional cost but well worh paying as you have an excellent view form the top back towards central Berlin",
          "Went to the Olympic stadion via public transport and the scenery is definitively impressive. It is worth a visit inside!",
          "Worth to take a metro and vitsit the Berlin olympic stadium. This is place of historic olympic games and you can see a lot of monuments here and whats best all the names of the winners are engraved to walls. Worth to visit for a sports and history fans.",
          "We took an English language tour which was very well presented and very good value - especially with the Berlin Welcome card reduction. We visited all areas of the stadium and heard about the olympic history and recent sporting events that have taken place there. It was a most",
          "Easily accessible by public transportation the Olympic Stadium is a very large venue with a lot of historical significance especially for Americans. The stadium is very well kept, pristine in fact. There are tours your can take for a nominal fee. The grounds outside the",
          "We arrived on the morning after a football match so the general admission was not possible. Instead we were offered a guided tour. I am so glad we did this as the guide was so good and you see so much more. You get everywhere from deep underground the stadium to walking at pitch",
          "Big stadium, cheap bear in front of gates (3\u20ac), inside 4,2\u20ac + 1\u20ac for plastic glass. Seting on chair si good, view is good, and stadion is Fantastic. Is it old, but renovirated for WC2006. It is obviuse when it is build. But it is nice stadium.",
          "We paid to have a tour in English of the stadium. I think it is worth doing especially if you want an insight into the \"insides\" of the stadium and the history of the place. It is a HUGE stadium and we had a very good guide that talked about the history of the stadium as well",
          "My friend and I went around 2 in the afternoon and were able to get an English language tour for 3 (3:30?) even though the website said English language tours were only in the morning. Tours were not given the day after, though, since there was a soccer game. Tour showed the",
          "Took the morning tour in English which lasts about an hour. This visit was a real highlight for us. It is certainly worth waiting and booking the tour as you are allowed to see areas that aren't permitted otherwise. Certainly recommended and easy to get to on the underground.",
          "Well worth a visit. Easily accessed by S5 and U2 from city centre. The whole Olympic village is still in use today. I'm glad I went.",
          "Very easy to get to via, underground train system. \u20ac8 to get in but worth every cent, to stand where the Olympics took place all those years ago. Very interesting place, which is now the home of a Berlin football team.",
          "Paid \u00a325 for match between Hertha and Frankfurt. Beautiful architecture on the outside of the stadium with the pitch below ground level inside a huge dome - shame there's a running track. Great Bratwurst / Currywurst outside, washed down with German beer.",
          "We visited Easter weekend when the weather was cold and wet. The staff in the visitor centre were very friendly. The poor weather maybe reduced numbers. You need a separate admission in to the clock tower. The exterior was quite neglected, inside it was spotless.",
          "Great for look. Didn't go in, but got to view from the nearby bell tower which was amazing. I'd recommend heading to the bell tower for some nice snaps.",
          "I bought a family ticket - I had to phone up, couldn't book on line, and must say thought the guided tour of the Stadium for \u20ac24 for 2 adukts and 2 kids is good value for money. You see the changing rooms hospitatlity areas, indoor training / warm up area for athletics etc.",
          "Although a bit out of the way, its certainly worth a visit for any sports fan.Definitely book the guided tour as you will learn far more than just wandering around & they take you to places within the stadium you would never know existed.",
          "Luckily we had a car available because I honestly do not know whether it would be worth while with public transport or taxi. It is quite fat out of Berlin but an interesting site taking in account its history!",
          "Amazing atmosphere and a real sense of history. Not too busy and plenty of staff on hand if needed. Easy to get to.",
          "We enjoyed our visit to this impressive building despite heavy rain while we were there. It is definitely worth booking ahead on the visitberlin website as English tours are available but they get booked up quickly. You can undertake a self guided tour also but cannot visit as",
          "My father and I actually only viewed the stadium from the outside. The structure itself is huge and very impressive to behold with its colosseum inspired design. We did pay for entry to the Glockenturm (Bell Tower) though which provided not only a brilliant view of the stadium,",
          "This will take you out of your comfort zone. Definitely worth the effort of going by public transport (either the U- or S-Bahn).",
          "Easily accessible by the train with just a short walk to bring you into the vicinity of the Olympic Stadium.",
          "Saw a home match (Hertha BSC-Augsburg). Great friendly atmosphere. No hooligans, no drunks, no fights. Fascinating walk around the Stadium remembering famous footage from the 1936 Olympiad.",
          "Being football fans we were always going to come here. Tour was great and had a great knowledge. Learned so much and it is a fantastic stadium with so much history. Glad we came here!",
          "I love football and whilst that isn't the stadiums only purpose what a historic venue this is! I certainly want to return for an away match with my second team Hamburger SV in the near future. We took in the tour and had a nice guide in Alex, unfortunately his team BVB beat",
          "Great night at the football with my son. Bought tickets online which were very reasonable and had a cracking night.",
          "Came to the stadium to take in the Berlin v Hoffenhiem match. I travelled via train to the stadium which was easy to do from the city centre. You depart the train about a 10 minute walk from the stadium and all the way up ( on match days) there are stalls selling beer, food and",
          "We caught the s bahn to the stadium . When we arrived at 11 we found the 1130 English tour was already fully booked and the next one was at 130 . I was initially very disappointed but we were advised to do the self guided tour . While this missed out the changing rooms it did",
          "We took the tour of the Stadium and loved it. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and made us laugh by humorously disproving Wikipedia as well as other comical elements. I didn't know much about the Stadium before but after I was amazed at how much it's gone through.",
          "Not expensive to get in, well worth a stroll around with the history behind it. Take your camera. Access to most areas very impressed.",
          "This is just a passage back to history. Stadium where the 1936 Olympics were held and where Hitler thought his team was invincible until the Americans prove him otherwise. Beautiful stadium still in great shape even though it has had several renovations.",
          "What a superb venue and well managed for the average football fan to enjoy a game. The fan area is full of retail outlets as well as the drinks/food vendors. And the occasional activity for fans to get involved with. And a nice grassy area for fans to go during half time.",
          "We took the 1h guided tour and I can recommend this for all visitors. First of all the guide (don't remember her name) was very knowledgeable and did a very good job to guide us around the stadium and at the same time gave us a history lesson. This stadium is 70% original and is",
          "Going to the Olpympic Stadium may be a bit \"out of the way\" but it is well worth the trip. the surrounding park is beautiful and the sight of the stadium is quite impressive. Putting it into perspective and thinking about a gone era, it becomes even more impressive and",
          "I wasn't blown away by the stadium nor by the tour but the guide was knowledgeable and really nice. The area around the stadium is lovely (across the bridge). It was mainly a trip for my partner but it was ok. I had read somewhere that their restaurant had things like burgers",
          "We went to this venue using the underground which was easy once got tickets,we booked on the tour of the stadium and our tour guide was excellent ,amazing facts and the austere building and recall of the time and the situation rather emotional",
          "Probably worth me splitting this review into two - firstly the stadium tour, and secondly, attending the Hertha Berlin game. The Stadium Tour is something I'd been wanting to do - I'd gone on a tour of the stadium in 2010 while on a trip with mates but the English tour wasn't",
          "Getting tickets on the day of the match was easy enough. Just head to the Hertha Club shop at the Europa centre in town. At 21 euros for a seat it's great value for money. The Stadium is awesome, you get a real sense of history from the place. The atmosphere was great and",
          "An amazing piece of architecture - and full of history. We did a tour and were shown different rooms inside the stadium including the chapel and changing rooms, but you can freely walk into the stadium without the tour. Our tour guide was full of interesting facts about the",
          "We visited the stadium expecting to be able to go on the tour around this amazing venue. We had been told by so many friends that the architecture and setting were stunning - they weren't wrong. However, (and we should have checked before hand) the venue was closed on the day we",
          "We were there a couple times, once in the UEFA champions league final, and also in some Hertha Berlin's games. The pitch is in a wonderful condition and the view is excellent. When you book a tour you can freely tour it yourself, before and after the tour beginns. The tour",
          "Originally built by the Nazis for the 1936 Olympics this is a place full of history. Its an amazing piece of architecture but the history of the place is overwhelming. It's now used as a football grouns and athletics stadium.",
          "One can feel the heat from the past. The monument where once Jesse Owens crushed some 'whiter' dreams. Sported among with the other athletes obviously. As the the fuehrer watched from his balcony. The old pics show nicely the settings as they were and how they are. A major",
          "History itself, the architecture is stunning, the scale impressive. you can get here on the S5 train ( Spandau direction ) from the centre of Berlin, then 5 minutes walk from the station. Its a stunning place to visit with all its history. It's expensive to go inside, but its",
          "Visiting the Olympic Stadium was one of the highlights of my trip to Berlin as it is such an incredible building in size and scope. The history that took place in the stadium adds another dimension to the place, so it really is the full package. The tour (in English) was",
          "This spot is perfect for anyone who wants to combine the history of the 1936 Berlin Olympics with modern day European football. I paid for a guided tour and it was well worth the nominal fee. The guide Michael was excellent. He took us through the stadium and showed us",
          "Classic stadium that is steeped in history. I arrived too late to participate in a tour as such so I paid 7 euros to walk around myself. You get to sit in the stands and take in the impressive stadium. You also get to read about the athletics that have taken place in the stadium",
          "A stadium has to be experienced in action, so naturally we went to see Hertha Berlin play. Unfortunately the opposing side was Ingolstadt, who is struggling to avoid relegation. Within a month after our visit Hertha faced both Bayern M\u00fcnchen and Borussia Dortmund at own turf, so",
          "We completed a tour of the stadium and the whole thing was fantastic! Great value for money, very informative and nice to see areas you wouldn't normally! I was very excited for this stadium due to the massive amounts of history behind it. It really is unique and a must visit!",
          "WOW....What a stadium. We booked tickets for the game in the UK and picked them up at the ground on the day. The atmosphere was amazing with both sets of fans all mingling together. The stadium was almost full and the Hertha fans in the Ostkurve were in a league of their own",
          "It's been a lifelong ambition of mine to visit Germany and experience the Bundesliga first hand. We chose Berlin as our destination and visited the Olympiastadion to watch Hertha Berlin play Bayern Munich. There are various stands selling souvenirs, food and drink outside the",

          "The Olympic Stadium, built for the 1936 Olympic Games, is a must-see in Berlin. Jesse Owens wons his four (4!) gold medals here: 100m, 200m, 100 m relay and long jump - much to Adolf Hitler's displeasure.",
          "Who loves architecture definitely a place for visit. Huge and massive .Try to catch a football match.",
          "An excellent stadium, easy to get to (30 minute U-bahn ride from Alexanderplatz). Imagine coming off the train and instantly being in front of scarf and shirt sellers, two small buildings selling beer, hot drinks and food. A short walk to the car park and the stadium comes into",
          "I visited the Olympic Stadium in Berlin in November of 2016 and was glad that I did! This is one of the most underrated things I've experienced in Berlin and I would recommend it to everyone. The stadium still gives one a great feel of what it was like back in 1936 when Jesse",

          "Still can not believe that this church are survive in both world war. Anyway this church is just in perfect location in Postdam with very classic and old building in the area. The Obelisk in the front also great. In perfect time you can hike up to the top and have a great view",
          "Lovely to look at but wouldn't go out my way to visit especially when cloudy and grey. Impressive all the same. Beautiful architecturally grand",
          "For 5\u20ac you can hike up to the top of the dome for a beautiful view of Potsdam and beyond on a nice day. It is circular stair sets that is small, narrow, tight twists, quite claustrophobic and 1 way direction. There are red and green lights on the turnstiles to direct traffic.",
          "As we all know this part of Germany was hit badly during the war, however.... this is a rebuild, however has that element of not feeling quite genuine. The surrounding structures are all relatively new. It is nice to look at, but lacks that element of history.",
          "I was not able to visit the church from inside, but for sure the church's dome is very impressive. It is a colossal architecture that deserves a pass by, which eventually happens if you are on your way to the train station.",
          "very impressive church in Potsdam, conviently located, stunning murals high up in the dome, interesting exhibitiion",
          "Located in a lovely area this is the oldest church in Berlin and surprisingly survived both wars. Worth a visit and stop for a while in the area.",
          "One of the biggest by the size of churches in Potsdam. Very light, both outside, and from within. Practically the first sight which you see having arrived to the town by train. Church - evangelic that left a mark on its internal furniture and art decoration. Certainly",
          "There is nothing left much after the original Nikolaikirche after the second world war. The building of church is new and do not have any historical value unfortunately. Visiting this place was same with visiting a regular church.",
          "The Nikolaikirche is a simple yet beautiful church, which you can (of course) enter for free. It has a calming atmosphere and an exciting history. For a small fee one can enter the tower, from where there is a great view over the city of Potsdam - it is definitely also worth a",
          "This restaurated church, now a museum contains a limited number of artifacts; not worth the trip, but when visiting the Nicolai Vierteil, certainly worth the visit. In a side chappel there is an altar cloth of 1300, very well preserved and nicely presented .",
          "This is not an ancient church (it was built from 1830 to 1837), but it's worth a short stop if you are in the downtown Potsdam area. Its' neoclassical style is a dramatic contrast to the palaces at Sans Souci. It's especially worth a visit if you feel like tackling the"

        "wiki": "Potsdam (German pronunciation: [\u02c8p\u0254t\u0361sdam] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of the German federal state of Brandenburg. It directly borders the German capital, Berlin, and is part of the Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region. It is situated on the River Havel some 25 kilometres (16 miles) southwest of Berlin's city centre.\nPotsdam was a residence of the Prussian kings and the German Kaiser until 1918. Its planning embodied ideas of the Age of Enlightenment: through a careful balance of architecture and landscape, Potsdam was intended as \"a picturesque, pastoral dream\" which would remind its residents of their relationship with nature and reason.The city lies in an area of interconnected lakes and is distinguished by a series of cultural landmarks, in particular the parks and palaces of Sanssouci, the largest World Heritage Site in Germany. The Potsdam Conference in 1945 was held at Cecilienhof Palace.\nBabelsberg, in the south-eastern part of Potsdam, was already by the 1930s the home of a major film production studio and it has enjoyed success as an important center of European film production since the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Filmstudio Babelsberg is the oldest large-scale film studio in the world.Potsdam developed into a centre of science in Germany in the 19th century. Today, there are three public colleges, the University of Potsdam, and more than 30 research institutes in the city.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe area was formed from a series of large moraines left after the last glacial period. Today, only one quarter of the city is built up, the rest remaining as green space.\nThere are about 20 lakes and rivers in and around Potsdam, such as the Havel, the Griebnitzsee, Templiner See, Tiefer See, Jungfernsee, Teltowkanal, Heiliger See, and Sacrower See. The highest point is the 114-metre (374 ft) high Kleiner Ravensberg.\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\nPotsdam is divided into seven historic city Bezirke and nine new Stadtteile (villages), which joined the city in 2003. The appearance of the city quarters is quite different. Those in the north and in the centre consist mainly of historical buildings, the south of the city is dominated by larger areas of newer buildings.\nThe city of Potsdam is divided into 34 Stadtteile (or quarters), which are divided further into 84 statistical Bezirke.\nToday one distinguishes between the older parts of the city (areas of the historic city and places suburbanized at the latest in 1939) - these are the city center, the western and northern suburbs, Bornim, Bornstedt, Nedlitz, Potsdam South, Babelsberg, Drewitz, Stern and Kirchsteigfeld - and those communities incorporated after 1990 which have since 2003 become Stadtteile - these are Eiche, Fahrland, Golm, Gro\u00df Glienicke, Grube, Marquardt, Neu Fahrland, Satzkorn and Uetz-Paaren. The new Stadtteile are located mainly in the north of the city. For the history of all incorporations, see the relevant section on incorporation and spin-offs.\nStructure with statistical numbering:\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nOfficially the climate is oceanic - more degraded by being far from the coast and to the east (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), but using the 1961-1990 normal and the 0 \u00b0C isotherm the city has a humid continental climate (Dfb), which also shows a slight influence of the continent different from the climates predominantly influenced by the Atlantic Ocean. Low averages below freezing for almost all winter causing snows that are frequent and winters are cold, but not as stringent as inland locations or with greater influence from the same. Summer is also relatively warm with temperatures between 23 and 24 \u00b0C, the heat waves being influenced by the UHI of Potsdam.The average winter high temperature is 3.5 \u00b0C (38.3 \u00b0F), with a low of \u22121.7 \u00b0C (28.9 \u00b0F). Snow is common in the winter. Spring and autumn are short. Summers are mild, with a high of 23.6 \u00b0C (74.5 \u00b0F) and a low of 12.7 \u00b0C (54.9 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Potsdam\" originally seems to have been Poztupimi. A common theory is that it derives from an old West Slavonic term meaning \"beneath the oaks\", i.e., the corrupted pod dubmi/dubimi (pod \"beneath\", dub \"oak\"). However some question this explanation.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre- and early history ===\n\nThe area around Potsdam shows signs of occupancy since the Bronze Age and was part of Magna Germania as described by Tacitus. After the great migrations of the Germanic peoples, Slavs moved in and Potsdam was probably founded after the 7th century as a settlement of the Hevelli tribe centred on a castle. It was first mentioned in a document in 993 as Poztupimi, when Emperor Otto III gifted the territory to the Quedlinburg Abbey, then led by his aunt Matilda. By 1317, it was mentioned as a small town. It gained its town charter in 1345. In 1573, it was still a small market town of 2,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n=== Early modern era ===\nPotsdam lost nearly half of its population due to the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648).\nA continuous Hohenzollern possession since 1415, Potsdam became prominent, when it was chosen in 1660 as the hunting residence of Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg, the core of the powerful state that later became the Kingdom of Prussia. It also housed Prussian barracks.\n\nAfter the Edict of Potsdam in 1685, Potsdam became a centre of European immigration. Its religious freedom attracted people from France (Huguenots), Russia, the Netherlands and Bohemia. The edict accelerated population growth and economic recovery.\nLater, the city became a full residence of the Prussian royal family. The buildings of the royal residences were built mainly during the reign of Frederick the Great. One of these is the Sanssouci Palace (French: \"without cares\", by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff, 1744), famed for its formal gardens and Rococo interiors. Other royal residences include the New Palace and the Orangery.\nIn 1815, at the formation of the Province of Brandenburg, Potsdam became the provincial capital until 1918, except for a period between 1827 and 1843 when Berlin was the provincial capital (as it became once again after 1918). The province comprised two governorates named after their capitals Potsdam and Frankfurt (Oder).\n\n\n=== Governorate of Potsdam ===\n\nBetween 1815 and 1945, the city of Potsdam served as capital of the governorate of Potsdam (German: Regierungsbezirk Potsdam). The Regierungsbezirk encompassed the former districts of Uckermark, the Mark of Priegnitz, and the greater part of the Middle March. It was situated between Mecklenburg and the Province of Pomerania on the north, and the Province of Saxony on the south and west (Berlin, with a small surrounding district, was an urban governorate and enclave within the governorate of Potsdam between 1815 and 1822, then it merged as urban district into the governorate only to be disentangled again from Potsdam governorate in 1875, becoming a distinct province-like entity on 1 April 1881). Towards the north west the governorate was bounded by the rivers Elbe and the Havel, and on the north east by the Oder. The south eastern boundary was to the neighbouring governorate of Frankfurt (Oder). About 500,000 inhabitants lived in the Potsdam governorate, which covered an area of about 20,700 square kilometres (7,992 sq mi), divided into thirteen rural districts, partially named after their capitals:\nThe traditional towns in the governorate were small, however, in the course of the industrial labour migration some reached the rank of urban districts. The principal towns were Brandenburg upon Havel, K\u00f6penick, Potsdam, Prenzlau, Spandau and Ruppin. Until 1875 Berlin also was a town within the governorate. After its disentanglement a number of its suburbs outside Berlin's municipal borders grew to towns, many forming urban Bezirke within the governorate of Potsdam such as Charlottenburg, Lichtenberg, Rixdorf (after 1912 Neuk\u00f6lln), and Sch\u00f6neberg (all of which, as well as K\u00f6penick and Spandau, incorporated into Greater Berlin in 1920). The urban Bezirke were (years indicating the elevation to rank of urban Bezirkor affiliation with Potsdam governorate, respectively):\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nBerlin was the capital of Prussia and later of the German Empire, but the court remained in Potsdam, where many government officials settled. In 1914, Emperor Wilhelm II signed the Declaration of War in the Neues Palais (New Palace). The city lost its status as a \"second capital\" in 1918, when Wilhelm II abdicated and Germany became a Republic at the end of World War I.\nAt the start of the Third Reich in 1933 there was a ceremonial handshake between President Paul von Hindenburg and the new Chancellor Adolf Hitler on 21 March 1933 in Potsdam's Garrison Church in what became known as the \"Day of Potsdam\". This symbolised a coalition of the military (Reichswehr) and Nazism. Potsdam was severely damaged by Allied bombing raids during World War II.\n\nThe Cecilienhof Palace was the scene of the Potsdam Conference from 17 July to 2 August 1945, at which the victorious Allied leaders (Harry S. Truman; Winston Churchill and his successor, Clement Attlee; and Joseph Stalin) met to decide the future of Germany and postwar Europe in general. The conference ended with the Potsdam Agreement and the Potsdam Declaration.\n\nThe government of East Germany (formally known as the German Democratic Republic (German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik, DDR)) tried to remove symbols of \"Prussian militarism\". Many historic buildings, some of them badly damaged in the war, were demolished.\nWhen in 1946 the remainder of the Province of Brandenburg west of the Oder-Nei\u00dfe line was constituted as the state of Brandenburg, Potsdam became its capital. In 1952 the GDR disestablished its federal states and replaced them by smaller new East German administrative districts known as Bezirke. Potsdam became the capital of the new Bezirk Potsdam until 1990.\nPotsdam, south-west of Berlin, lay just outside West Berlin after the construction of the Berlin Wall. The walling off of West Berlin not only isolated Potsdam from West Berlin, but also doubled commuting times to East Berlin. The Glienicke Bridge across the Havel connected the city to West Berlin and was the scene of some Cold War exchanges of spies.\nAfter German reunification, Potsdam became the capital of the newly re-established state of Brandenburg. Since then there have been many ideas and efforts to reconstruct the original appearance of the city, including the Potsdam City Palace and the Garrison Church.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nSince 2000 Potsdam has been one of the fastest growing cities in Germany.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== International residents ===\n\nLargest groups of foreign residents:\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\n\n=== City government ===\nPotsdam has had a mayor (B\u00fcrgermeister) and city council since the 15th century. From 1809 the city council was elected, with a mayor (Oberb\u00fcrgermeister) at its head. During the Third Reich the mayor was selected by the NSDAP and the city council was dissolved; it was reconstituted in token form after 1945, but free elections did not take place until after reunification.\nToday, the city council is the city's central administrative authority. Local elections took place on 26 October 2003 and again in 2008. Between 1990 and 1999, the Chairman of the City Council was known as the \"Town President\" but today the post is the \"Chairman of the City Council\". The mayor is elected directly by the population.\n\n\n=== Brandenburg state government ===\nThe Landtag Brandenburg, the parliament of the federal state of Brandenburg is in Potsdam. It has been housed in the Potsdam City Palace since 2014.\n\n\n== Twin towns - sister cities ==\n\nPotsdam is twinned with:\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\n\n==== Rail transport ====\nPotsdam, included in the fare zone \"C\" (Tarifbereich C) of Berlin's public transport area and fare zones A and B of its own public transport area, is served by the S7 S-Bahn line. The stations served are Griebnitzsee, Babelsberg and the Central Station (Hauptbahnhof), the main and long-distance station of the city. Other DB stations in Potsdam are Charlottenhof, Park Sanssouci (including the monumental Kaiserbahnhof), Medienstadt Babelsberg, Rehbr\u00fccke, Pirschheide and Marquardt. The city also possesses a 27 km-long tramway network.\n\n\n==== Road transport ====\nPotsdam is served by several motorways: the A 10, a beltway better known as Berliner Ring, the A 115 (using part of the AVUS) and is closely linked to the A 2 and A 9. The B 1 and B 2 federal roads cross the city. Potsdam features a network of urban and suburban buses.\n\n\n== Education and research ==\n\nPotsdam is a university town. The University of Potsdam was founded in 1991 as a university of the State of Brandenburg. Its predecessor was the Akademie f\u00fcr Staats- und Rechtswissenschaften der DDR \"Walter Ulbricht\", a college of education founded in 1948 which was one of the GDR's most important colleges. There are about 20,000 students enrolled at the university.\n\nIn 1991 the Fachhochschule Potsdam was founded as the second college. It had 3,518 students as of 2017.Konrad Wolf Film University of Babelsberg (HFF), founded in 1954 in Babelsberg, is the foremost centre of the German film industry since its birth, with over 600 students.\nThere are also several research foundations, including Fraunhofer Institutes for Applied Polymer Research and Biomedical Engineering, Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute), Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces, and Max Planck Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology, the GFZ - German Research Centre for Geosciences, the Potsdam Astrophysical Institute, the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies, The Leibniz Institute for Agricultural Engineering and Bioeconomy and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, which employs 340 people in researching climate change.As well as universities, Potsdam is home to reputable secondary schools. Montessori Gesamtschule Potsdam, in western Potsdam, attracts 400 students from the Brandenburg and Berlin region.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nPotsdam was historically a centre of European immigration. Its religious tolerance attracted people from France, Russia, the Netherlands and Bohemia. This is still visible in the culture and architecture of the city.\nThe most popular attraction in Potsdam is Sanssouci Park, 2 km (1 mi) west of the city centre. In 1744 King Frederick the Great ordered the construction of a residence here, where he could live sans souci (\"without worries\", in the French spoken at the court). The park hosts a botanical garden (Botanical Garden, Potsdam) and many buildings:\n\nThe Sanssouci Palace (Schloss Sanssouci), a relatively modest palace of the Prussian royal (and later German imperial) family\nThe Orangery Palace (Orangerieschloss), former palace for foreign royal guests\nThe New Palace (Neues Palais), built between 1763 and 1769 to celebrate the end of the Seven Years' War, in which Prussia held off the combined attacks of Austria and Russia. It is a much larger and grander palace than Sanssouci, having over 200 rooms and 400 statues as decoration. It served as a guest house for numerous royal visitors. Today, it houses parts of University of Potsdam.\nThe Charlottenhof Palace (Schloss Charlottenhof), a Neoclassical palace by Karl Friedrich Schinkel built in 1826\nThe Roman Baths (R\u00f6mische B\u00e4der), built by Karl Friedrich Schinkel and Friedrich Ludwig Persius in 1829\u20131840. It is a complex of buildings including a tea pavilion, a Renaissance-style villa, and a Roman bathhouse (from which the whole complex takes its name).\nThe Chinese Tea House (Chinesisches Teehaus), an 18th-century pavilion built in a Chinese style, the fashion of the time.Three gates from the original city wall remain today. The oldest is the Hunters' Gate (J\u00e4gertor), built in 1733. The Nauener Tor was built in 1755 and close to the historic Dutch Quarter. The ornate Brandenburg Gate (built in 1770, not to be confused with the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin) is situated on the Luisenplatz at the western entrance to the old town.\n\nThe Old Market Square (Alter Markt) is Potsdam's historical city centre. For three centuries this was the site of the City Palace (Stadtschlo\u00df), a royal palace built in 1662. Under Frederick the Great, the palace became the winter residence of the Prussian kings. The palace was severely damaged by Allied bombing in 1945 and demolished in 1961 by the Communist authorities. In 2002 the Fortuna Gate (Fortunaportal) was rebuilt in its original historic position which was followed by a complete reconstruction of the palace as the Brandenburg Landtag building inaugurated in 2014. Nearby the square in the Humboldtstra\u00dfe block, which also was demolished after getting damaged in 1945, reconstructions of several representative residential palaces including Palazzo Pompei and Palazzo Barberini housing an arts museum were completed in 2016-2017 alongside buildings with modernized facades to restore the historical proportions of the block.\n\nThe Old Market Square is dominated today by the dome of St. Nicholas' Church (Nikolaikirche), built in 1837 in the Neoclassical style. It was the last work of Karl Friedrich Schinkel, who designed the building but did not live to see its completion. It was finished by his disciples Friedrich August St\u00fcler and Ludwig Persius. The eastern side of the Market Square is dominated by the Old City Hall (Altes Rathaus), built in 1755 by the Dutch architect Jan Bouman (1706\u20131776). It has a characteristic circular tower, crowned with a gilded Atlas bearing the world on his shoulders.\n\nNorth of the Old Market Square is the oval French Church (Franz\u00f6sische Kirche), erected in the 1750s by Boumann for the Huguenot community. To the south lies the Museum Barberini, a copy of the previous building, the Barberini Palace. The museum was funded by the German billionaire Hasso Plattner. The former Baroque building was built by Carl von Gontard in 1771\u20131772, inspired by the Renaissance palace Palazzo Barberini in Rome. The newly built museum was scheduled to open in spring 2017.\nAnother landmark of Potsdam is the two-street Dutch Quarter (Holl\u00e4ndisches Viertel), an ensemble of buildings that is unique in Europe, with about 150 houses built of red bricks in the Dutch style. It was built between 1734 and 1742 under the direction of Jan Bouman to be used by Dutch artisans and craftsmen who had been invited to settle here by King Frederick Wilhelm I. Today, this area is one of Potsdam's most visited quarters.\nNorth of the city centre is the Russian colony of Alexandrowka, a small enclave of Russian architecture (including an Orthodox chapel) built in 1825 for a group of Russian immigrants. Since 1999, the colony has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin.\nEast of the Alexandrowka colony is a large park, the New Garden (Neuer Garten), which was laid out from 1786 in the English style. The site contains two palaces; one of them, the Cecilienhof, was where the Potsdam Conference was held in July and August 1945. The Marmorpalais (Marble Palace) was built in 1789 in Neoclassical style. Nearby is the Biosph\u00e4re Potsdam, a tropical botanical garden.\nBabelsberg, a quarter south-east of the centre, houses the UFA film studios (Babelsberg Studios), and an extensive park with some historical buildings, including the Babelsberg Palace (Schlo\u00df Babelsberg, a Gothic revival palace designed by Schinkel).\nThe Einstein Tower is located within the Albert Einstein Science Park, which is on the top of the Telegraphenberg within an astronomy compound.\nPotsdam also features a memorial centre in the former KGB prison in Leistikowstra\u00dfe. In the Volkspark to the north, there is one of the last monuments dedicated to Lenin in Germany.\nPotsdam joined UNESCO's Network of Creative Cities as a Design City on October 31, 2019 on the occasion of World Cities\u2019 Day.\n\n\n== Parks ==\nThere are many parks in Potsdam, most of them UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Among their attractions are:\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Sports ==\n1.

        "wiki": "Ss. Peter and Paul Church on Nikolsko\u00eb is a Protestant church in the Volkspark Glienecke in Berlin, Germany. It is currently administered by the Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia. The church is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin.\n\n\n== History ==\nKing Friedrich Wilhelm III had the church built for the residents of Klein-Glienicke and Pfaueninsel on a bluff on the Havel near the Pfaueninsel and the Nikolsko\u00eb Blockhouse. It was designed by the architects Friedrich August St\u00fcler and Albert Dietrich Schadow. Friedrich Wilhelm selected the Russian style to commemorate the marriage of his daughter Charlotte to the later Tsar Nicholas I of Russia. The king visited them at St. Petersburg in 1818 and for a return visit a year later had a Russian-style blockhouse built in the park at Glienicke, naming it Nikolsko\u00eb. In 1832, the king then ordered the construction of the nearby church which took place from 1834 to 1837.It was inaugurated on August 13, 1837.\nUntil 1961, when the Berlin Wall cut the parish into three separate parts, Ss. Peter and Paul Church was part of the Evangelical Congregation of Neubabelsberg, then comprising a parish in Potsdam-Babelsberg, Klein-Glienicke (divided between Berlin and Potsdam), Nikolsko\u00eb and Potsdam-Sacrow with the further chapel in Klein-Glienicke and the Church of the Redeemer, Sacrow.\nOn December 22, 1941 the official German Evangelical Church called for suited actions by all Protestant church bodies to withhold baptised non-Aryans from all spheres of Protestant church life. Many German Christian-dominated congregations followed suit. However, the Evangelical Congregation of Neubabelsberg handed in a list of signatures in protest against the exclusion of the stigmatised Protestants of Jewish descent.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe church has a Russian Orthodox profile, with the noteworthy difference that it has only one onion dome, instead of the five usually seen in Russia.\nSs. Peter and Paul contains the grave of Prince Charles of Prussia. The design of its current glockenspiel is based on that of the Potsdam Garrison Church.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSt. Peter und Paul auf der Website Kulturf\u00fchrer Berlin\nKirche St. Peter und Paul\nEvangelische Kirche St. Peter und Paul auf Nikolskoe",

Himmler, a racist fanatic, screened applicants for their supposed physical perfection and racial purity but recruited members from all ranks of German society. With their sleek black uniforms and special insignia (lightninglike runic S\u2019s, death\u2019s head badges, and silver daggers), the men of the SS felt superior to the brawling brown-shirted Storm Troopers of the SA, to which initially they were nominally subordinate.When Hitler, with SS help, purged the SA in 1934 and reduced it to political impotence, the SS became an independent group responsible, via Himmler, to Hitler alone. Between 1934 and 1936 Himmler and his chief adjutant, Reinhard Heydrich, consolidated SS strength by gaining control of all of Germany\u2019s police forces and expanding their organization\u2019s responsibilities and activities. At the same time, special military SS units were trained and equipped along the lines of the regular army. By 1939 the SS, now numbering about 250,000 men, had become a massive and labyrinthian bureaucracy, divided mainly into two groups: the Allgemeine-SS (General SS) and the Waffen-SS (Armed SS).Heinrich HimmlerHeinrich Himmler.Camera Press/Globe PhotosThe Allgemeine-SS dealt mainly with police and \u201cracial\u201d matters. Its most important division was the Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA; Reich Security Central Office), which oversaw the Sicherheitspolizei (Sipo; Security Police), which, in turn, was divided into the Kriminalpolizei (Kripo; Criminal Police) and the dreaded Gestapo under Heinrich M\u00fcller. The RSHA also included the Sicherheitsdienst (SD; Security Service), a security department in charge of foreign and domestic intelligence and espionage.\r\nGet exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription. \r\nSubscribe today\nThe Waffen-SS was made up of three subgroups: the Leibstandarte, Hitler\u2019s personal bodyguard; the Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde (Death\u2019s-Head Battalions), which administered the concentration camps and a vast empire of slave labour drawn from the Jews and the populations of the occupied territories; and the Verf\u00fcgungstruppen (Disposition Troops), which swelled to 39 divisions in World War II and which, serving as elite combat troops alongside the regular army, gained a reputation as fanatical fighters.Waffen-SS Sturmgesch\u00fctz armored fighting vehicleGerman machine-gunner advancing through a field alongside a Waffen-SS Sturmgesch\u00fctz armored fighting vehicle on the Russian front.

        "wiki": "Ebertstra\u00dfe is a street in Berlin, the capital of Germany. It runs on a roughly north-south line from the Brandenburg Gate to Potsdamer Platz in the centre of the city.\nAs one heads south down Ebertstra\u00dfe, the Tiergarten, a large forested park, is to one's right, and the new United States Embassy to the left. Across the corner of Behrenstra\u00dfe on the left is the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. Beyond that is the Ministergarten, which was once the gardens at the rear of the old Foreign Office building in Wilhelmstra\u00dfe, and now the location of numerous modern office buildings. At the southern end of the street, past the corner of Lenn\u00e9stra\u00dfe on the right, is the new entertainment precinct around the rebuilt Potsdamer Platz.\n\nThe street follows the line of the walls of the mediaeval Prussian fortress town of Berlin, linking the Brandenburg Gate with the Potsdam Gate, which stood where Potsdamer Platz now is. After the demolition of the walls it was laid out as a street. Following the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, it was named K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tzer Stra\u00dfe in honour of the Prussian victory over Austria at the Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz. After World War I, this name was considered unsuitably militaristic, and the street was renamed \"Budapester Stra\u00dfe\" (the street south of the Tiergarten now called Budapester Stra\u00dfe was at that time an eastwards continuation of the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm). After the death of the first President of the Weimar Republic, Friedrich Ebert, in 1925, it was renamed Ebertstra\u00dfe in 1930, but in 1935, under the Nazi regime, it was called Hermann-G\u00f6ring-Stra\u00dfe, after Reichsmarschall Hermann G\u00f6ring, whose official residence was close by.\nIn the mid-1930s almost the entire street was dug up for the building of the S-Bahn \"north-south link\" line from Unter den Linden to Yorckstra\u00dfe, via Potsdamer Platz and Anhalter Bahnhof. The idea for such a link had first been mooted in 1914, but detailed plans were not drawn up until 1928, and then approval had to wait until 1933. Construction began in 1934, but determination to have it finished in time for the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936 meant safety measures were ignored: on 20 August 1935 a tunnel collapse just south of the Brandenburg Gate buried twenty-three workmen of whom only four survived; then on 28 December 1936 a fire near Potsdamer Platz station destroyed vital equipment. The section did not finally open until 15 April 1939.\nOn 31 July 1947, after World War II, the street was renamed back to Ebertstra\u00dfe. From 1961 to 1989 the Berlin Wall ran along most of its length.\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhotos of prewar Ebertstra\u00dfe\nroad map\naerial photo",

          "The monuments are impressive and amazing. The story around it is touching and terrible. Worth a visit",
          "While I appreciate the sentiment, the meaning of this memorial was lost on me. It does not make the powerful statement that I have felt at other memorial installations.",
          "The memorial itself is symbolic, but it is a shame that people sit on top of the blocks and take photos and people allow their kids to run around and play games as it is takes away from the serious nature of the place. The information centre underneath the memorial is excellent",
          "I suppose the memorial is meant to be immersive, you have to walk into the maze, let yourself be swallowed up by the stones. Impressive memorial.",
          "We had been before and I have to say it's not the best memorial I ve Ever seen , and that has nothing to do with the shame of the holocaust it's just looks blank and says nothing .there's no emotion coming through from the artists all .. Sorry",
          "This is a stark reminder of man's inhumanity. It is a large sad, symbolic display. But, it wasn't designed for enjoyment.",
          "No review would give you an idea of what this place does to you. It\u2019s truly fitting for such a tragedy. It\u2019s interpretation is completely down to the individual. I recommend that when you visit this memorial, you do so with friends, however you should split up and walk through",
          "Visited the memorial as part of a walking tour which was very interesting to listen to the guide with his facts.",
          "It is hard to think you are under 10 minutes walk away from the Brandenburg Gate and the bustle of the Unter den Linden when you get here. The architecture is quite unique and impressive and you can also go to a basement level for an exhibition.",
          "Beautiful architectural monument to pay tribute to the Holocaust, lots of youngsters taking selfies and playing around but better that kind of happiness than sadness",
          "I understand the significance of this memorial but I think they could have done a better job. Not much to see. Contemporary. You can essentially see it from the car windows. 2,711 slabs of concrete on uneven ground. That was it. I didn\u2019t understand it.",
          "didn't do the tour just went around the blocks , fairly busy but bearable , i wouldn't do it again in truth",
          "Its a very sombre place to be and reminded of our dark history. In a way, it teaches us a lot. The sad horror that the Jews and homosexuals had to undergo. Must visit , Just stand in the midst and reflect on the past of what they persecuted went through. The memorial is located",
          "Its worth a visit to know why this is here. A bit of history and sadness. Go with a tour guide or a walking tour to know more about the place",
          "Wow - what a unique memorial and an incredibly sobering experience! This is a must-do in Berlin, for sure. You enter alone, left to wander confusedly to contemplate the terrible atrocities on human life. We went here in August 2019 as part of \"Alla Tours\" all day tour of Berlin",
          "Germany\u2019s capital was at the heart of some of humanity\u2019s darkest days, and monuments and museums are open to commemorate the countless victims. The place to go to experience the sheer scale of loss of World War II is to visit the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe.",
          "The Holocaust Memorial occupies a significant area of Berlin's very center, only one block south from the Brandenburg gate and Reichstag, among several major embassies. It was established (built) at the beginning of this century, on no man's land, in fact on the death strip",
          "This didn't create any emotional response and was more like a modern art installation. Nearby construction didn't help and visitors were treating it like a maze and were not respectful of the monument.",
          "Unsettling, unnerving and thought provoking. As you walk through the structure, it becomes overwhelming. This visit will stay with you for a while.",
          "Definitely a must see in Berlin - a monument that lets you interpret this fascinating piece of art your own way.",
          "This is memorial, not instagram central so please be respectful (no jumping from one pillar to another or funny videos). It is not a maze but a memorial. It was sad to see how tourists behaved. In terms of best time to go to see fewer people I would say at sunrise",
          "Makes you think about lot of things.. Interesting to see and walk into. I recommend to visit this place. Easy to get to.",
          "cinder blocks that create a burial atmosphere . It is not an obvious attraction - one should look, sit and contemplate. This is about reflection and a message of remembrance.",
          "Beautiful and moving monument to the Jews who perished during the Holocaust. Do visit. I've heard sometimes people aren't respectful and are busy taking selfies, oblivious to the meaning of where they are. Fortunately this was not the case when we visited.",
          "Very poignant memorial to the Jews suffering during the war. The true stories and real extracts of letters written by the Prisoners brings it home. Well worth a visit.",
          "Close to the Brandenburg Gate in the heart of Berlin you will find the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. A must to see!",
          "A very thought provoking museum. It recounted the stories of many Jewish families and their fate, providing evidence in the form of audio, visual and written accounts. My teenage daughter found it very informative and left with a far greater understanding of what the Jews",
          "This is pretty bleak memorial when you think about what its actually for but to be honest unless you read up or are told this is a memorial to the Jews you would assume it was some modern art. We wondered round the cubes and some are massive. Didn't have time to go to the",
          "First view you wonder why, but start walking through blocks and it becomes a very haunting experiance",
          "Cubes stand in rows, too numerous to count, I found it rather an odd memorial, by design, yet I was moved by it. How do you represent such an horror in today\u2019s world..? I have to say I was pretty shocked to see people seating on top of the cubes, eating and drinking, to me that",
          "A 1 Min walk from the Brandenburg Gate this amazing tribute and memorial is free and very little said about it when there. American embassy is opposite if that helps. Definitely somewhere to visit in the day. Not sure about the evening.",
          "I didn't like this at first and apparently I'm not the only one - it's been quite controversial. It felt flat, grey and unrepresentative of the horrors it memorialises. But, as you walk in and down - become immersed in grey concrete, realise it is far bigger and deeper than you",
          "The concrete blocks are just the surface of this memorial. Find your way to the underground area to really be impacted by this memorial. Includes an explanation of the calculated, persistent, evil persecutions of the mid 20 century, and personal stories of some of those who were",
          "Just a short walk from Potsdammer Platz or the Brandenburg Gate. A contemplative walk round the blocks of varied height may not be on the top of everyone's list of things to see. When you have done your walk cross the busy road to the Tier Garten, her you will find another",
          "The blocks above ground seem a bit odd at first and the undulating ground messes with the mind. Is it meant to convey the disoriented, twisted treatment of the Jews? It would have worked had it not been for youngsters (teenagers, not kids) treating it as a playground or maze,",
          "This was really interesting and more moving than you might think. Worth the time to walk through and think about the Murdered Jews of Europe.",
          "I guess this will be in you top 5 places to see when in Berlin. It is basically just a walk around and not much info there you will have to read up or join a tour to know more. But the Memorial place is done very creatively.",
          "This was a quite stunning part of a walking tour which we really did not expect to be so big. The slabs which make up the memoriar are various sizes - 2700 slabs 7ft x 3ft with heights up to nearly 5 metres - in the light we had the effect was stunning - high contract. The",
          "The memorial is quiet from the busy city of Berlin. It is peaceful once you get into the memorial. The way they presented what had happened is done well. The muesum is free and is not too long, yet not too short. It is a must see.",
          "Okay, knowing the history this place puts you thinking how sick people can be to each others. Must visit when in Berlin.",
          "We passed by this memorial on a cold, wet and very windy day which made this large area of concrete coffin shapes concrete blocks in different sizes even more impressive. The underground exhibition will tell you individual stories. A must visit when in Berlin.",
          "terribly ugly place... not maintained, dirty and full of tourists for selfies.... the worst place in berlin",
          "a must visit for everypne who visits Berlin. This tour has testimonies of the people directly affected by the darkest chapter of mankind.",
          "A very intelligent, thought provoking and emotional place to visit. Would be easy to get lost in numbers but while giving you the figures it also vividly describes how the holocaust developed and the impact it had on individuals and families. The audio is only 3 euros and is",
          "A solemn, cold thought provoking memorial! This memorial is spread over quite a large area. It is a series of coffin shaped grey concrete blocks which are open to your own interpretation.",
          "You almost stumble upon it-on the pavement looking back at the Reichstag and Brandenburg tor... then you wonder what it is? And then it dawns on you- diff size blocks alleys of narrow spaces solitary monoliths... a grave a tomb a marker a doorway ... none of them, all of them..",
          "Words cannot explain how moving and sad this memorial is,It is handled so well. All who visit Berlin must take the time to see what people had to endure under the Nazis.",
          "This is a must see memorial to the murdered Jews across mainland Europe. Very informative, very sad and very harrowing experience. I strongly recommend the audio guide, Quite an unbeliaveble experience",
          "Must visit for a history lover. Adjacent to Brandenburg Gate and Hitler's bunker where he committed suicide",
          "I want to go back, we visited it with a free walking tour and we didn't have enough time to get lost, I think you really need to spend some time alone to think about what happened and how cruel was the Holocausto.",
          "I was very sad walking thru here especially when i heard all about the history of the Jews who were murdered.",
          "Very insightful and moving tribute to what happened. We opted for the audio description and you can\u2019t put into words how to feel about it. You must visit this when in Berlin.",
          "A well thought out memorial to the victims of the holocaust, provides more questions than answers. The architect has provided a layout that leaves you guessing as to what it represents.",
          "Very thought provoking and extremely interesting memorial. We didn\u2019t have to wait too long to get in and we opted for the audio service which was worth using. Everyone who visits Berlin should visit here. The stories and the details are heartbreaking but should be told. Highly",
          "I'm not quite sure what the creator of this memorial with hundreds of grey concrete blocks intended to portray, but that makes it open to discussion and interpretation.",
          "Obviously the subject of the museum displays is extremely sad, but it is definitely worth visiting. The displays are excellent, there's lots of information and even quotes from letters written by victims of the tragedy. The memorial itself is beautiful in its harrowing",
          "How to make 6,000,000 not just a number? The illustration these concrete blocks symbolises, left us all silent, reflective, and with a long-lasting memory of the cruelty that man can make. The 10-y boy was silent, and then questioning/discussing - giving words to the grief.",
          "This is a true reminder of some of the worst of German history. It is a poignat place and alows for reflection. Well worth a visit. It is a shame that security staff have to, at times, remind people of the need for respect at such a historic sight.",
          "We were here early morning (around 7:30) and it was deserted. Easier to get pictures when not lots of people around.",
          "Within walking distance from several must-see s in Berlin, even if you're on a tight schedule like us, do pass by. Interesting arrangement of grey slabs of varying heights. Be evoked.",
          "A beautiful memorial and museum. I was in tears at some of the stories I read walking around. A must see.",
          "As part of an excellent walking tour we stopped and was given an explanation that the memorial is not purely for the Jewish lost in Germany but throughout Europe. The most disturbing fact came when it was explained that some columns are crumbling due to the weather (we\u2019d noticed",
          "The memorial is some sort of maze type accumulation of large cubes. Why this was designed for a memorial I\u2019m not entirely sure I guess it\u2019s open for interpretation. It\u2019s cool to get lost within it",
          "If you would like to visit the sad history of Berlin, you will need to spend few minutes here. Easy to approach, however it is not a place you would spend a lot of time at. No restaurants, toilets nearby, the area is not covered. Would not recommend for families. If you are not",
          "I\u2019ve been twice, and it\u2019s more moving and relevant now than even 11 years ago. Don\u2019t miss this stunning confluence of art, human horror, and hope.",
          "So many stones makes you wonder that where all these people counted at all as humans or were they just pieces.",
          "We visited as part of a guided tour. Most helpful advice our guide gave us, was to make our own translation and ideas of the monument. Worth taking the time and effort for if you do nothing else relating to the holocaust.",
          "Lest I am misnderstood - to even have such a memorial in the German capital demonstrates the rehabilitation of this great nation after the trauma of 1933 -45, and I do not for one minute denigrate or disapprove of holocaust memorials - but I'm not really sure of the artistic",
          "A very somber place bit amazing to walk through , don\u2019t be disrespectful though and jump across stones for photos we saw a few do this but were swiftly told off by security !",
          "Thought provoking and a must for any visit to Berlin. Give yourself 1/2 hour to walk through the site",
          "We've all seen the documentaries on TV etc. but this memorial and the \"exhibition\" gave the extent of what happened a totally new meaning. Very sombre experience and one that ideally all humanity should experience to make us all think about what happened and prevent anything",
          "What a important monument and how important it is that we never forget. It\u2019s both beautiful and sad to visit.",
          "Very unique, not sure how one designs this, creative ideas. Blocks represent coffins. Easy to walk through, worth a quick stop.",
          "A must see when in Berlin. This museum is very well laid out and creative and is a fitting tribute to Europe\u2019s murdered Jews. The audio guide was great and would recommend paying the \u20ac3 for this.",
          "I was amazed at the impact this had. You need to experience it yourself as it promotes a personal reaction. The designer had no rationale so it would be arrogant of me to propose my own. The one thing I really felt angry about was a family playing hide and seek and pretending",
          "Really? A Holocaust memorial in Germany? Surely they could have designed something better, a more appropriate memorial? I visited auschwitz before visiting this memorial. Disappointed",
          "A sobering memorial and learning experience - street level is a stark visual of a sea of \u201ccoffins\u201d to represent the Murdered Jews. Below is a small yet powerful museum. Take the audio tour, we much as I thought I knew, I learned more. They pick out the very personal stories of a",
          "I found this to be a very moving display. This is an large (perhaps 2 acre) undulating display of various sizes of cubes. It should be viewed in a quiet, sobering atmosphere. It often is not; this is not the fault of the memorial. The structure is a place that also attracts",
          "My wife, son, daughter and I visited The Holocaust Memorial - Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in December 2019. I had visited here in August 2018. My wife, son and daughter seemed very reflective as they walked around the stone blocks. I noticed that there is a lot of",
          "The Holocaust Memorial is a stunning tribute to the people who lost their lives during this terrible event. The stone blocks seem to go on and on in the distance, every channel has a different size and alignment. A marvellous tribute to The Holocaust event.",
          "No words... Beautiful Monument to those who lost their lives and suffered through this time. Easy access and very busy in summer and high season, but worth visiting",
          "As you walk through the rows, notice that the monuments begin to swallow you up gradually as the path sinks and the monuments rise, just as gradually as Nazi mindsets swept into Central Europe and eradicated millions. Very simple, very moving.",
          "In the middle of a busy city a haunting hush surrounds you as you enter. A fitting tribute. History at its best.",
          "The place is full of people taking selfies but even that doesn't take away the feeling you get there. Each one of us had a different understanding of what the blocks represent but everyone was very impressed.",
          "Theres no explanation as to why theres sk many columns, why they're the different sizes. I really like this concept as it provokes you to make your own interpretation. Very clever, invoking remembrance.",
          "thought provoking meander through the walkways close to the Brandenberg Gate and Reichstag. very peaceful although next to main road",
          "This was one of the monuments that was a must see when I was in Berlin. Honestly it was a little to hard since google map didn't make it very clear and luckily I was with a local who showed me. It's right next to the Gate and you can't really miss it! It was really nice to walk",
          "Loved it. The memorial itself is quite overwhelming when you stand in it. Don\u2019t miss the museum. The line moves quickly, it\u2019s free and it\u2019s both emotional and informative.",
          "I had walked past this monument without realising what it was and driven past it on a couple of times. It was only when google maps pointed it out that I crossed the road and realised that the blocks of stone was the memorial. Personally this is an example of a lost opportunity",
          "A must see!! Very impressive and heart wrenching. Something that should never happen again anywhere in this world.",
          "To fully appreciate this Memorial - walk in and out of the columns and feel the magnitude and sadness of what took place.",
          "Visited this memorial on a dreary rainy day. First impressions were not really that good a lot of concrete blocks but once you start going through the lines of them and thinking about the people it does get to you",
          "Definitely worth the trip too see this monument of this black time in history and all the lost life\u2019s.",
          "I don\u2019t think words can describe how sad and beautiful this place is. Couldn\u2019t imagine not going to Berlin and visiting. Must see",
          "At first glance you think it is just a bunch of concrete blocks and it is nothing out of the ordinary. When you realise each block is different, all the blocks are angled separately and the walkways alter every which way, you can understand the confusion they must have felt. We",
          "We expected this memorial to have some sort of history boards with a bit of information on when this was built why etc. Instead it is just great blocks of concrete that you can walk through. A little bit boring but good if you want to take photos.",
          "I walked through the memorial on two or three occasions on my last visit, the large blocks and rolling paths are interesting in that as you progress your lost in thoughts and leave today\u2019s world behind. A solemn reminder of a horrific chapter of human history.",
          "I cannot leave enough stars or a high enough review of this great place. I was truly blown away by the memorial, and the museum underneath is absolutely amazing. A large museum, i paid the \u20ac3 for the audio guide and it was well worth it. First hand stories of the holocaust,",
          "This is a stunning memorial with symmetrical architecture to remember those who died. The colours used in the architecture really represent the dark history of The Holocaust. This is the most stunning design memorial I have easily have seen.",
          "This was an amazing experience it was free although you can leave a voluntary contribution. We paid \u20ac6 for the English speaking headphones. The information was so informative. I found it very emotional for obvious reasons. I have recently been to Poland and to Auschwiitz So this",
          "This was one of the sights we wanted to see when we're in Berlin was the Holocaust memorial, was humbling to be stood amongst it and think of all those ppl that lost there lives during the Holocaust. If in Berlin you have to visit.",
          "An excellent memorial and grand in size. The backstory is equally as powerful. Walk the paths and reflect.",
          "there is a memorial you can go down into but the queue can be long , it is very moving and worth a visit",
          "A very humbling experience well worth a visit. The information centre which is below the memorial is also worth going to. We did the audio tour for only 3\u20ac.",
          "The genius of this memorial is in its design, which could be interpreted in a myriad of ways and underscores the reality and tragedy of the holocaust.",
          "visit this place and remembered what happened in rohingnya or uighur.. make me thinking about humanity. i always hate politics. its the main reason of human conflict. this monument became the reminder how bad poltics can be",
          "Very moving space and the underground museum is incredibly moving and set up very well. A must do whilst in Berlin.",
          "Who would have thought rectangular blocks of concrete could paint such a picture. Certainly worth experiencing and taking a little time out of rushing round Berlin",
          "Walking between the blocks in the cold air of Berlin gives you the right moment to think about history and have a silent moment for both: the jews and the germans. Judgeless. Nude. Like the big grey stone blocks.",
          "Great experience, very moving and very unique due to the arqueitecture of the monument, never seen something quite like it before. Would go again if a visit Berlin.",
          "Whilst the stones are thought provoking, it is well worthwhile going to the museum underneath the memorial. The description of the museum is understated in the blah blah. The exhibition is very clever in its storytelling. A must see",
          "This is one of the must see places and every individual feels the place in a different way. Pray for the people who suffered.",
          "The memorial is a must see in Berlin. It is a very poignant momument to those who lost their lives. You can walk inbetween the stones in a labyrinth and in the middle of it you can really feel the pain and huge loss of life. It's such a sombre place but be weary of idiots",
          "Any visit to Berlin must include several stops! Well, the Holocaust Memorial is certainly one of them. I struggle going to places like this since I grieve when I think about how evil humanity can be, but then I realize this is exactly why I must visit it and pay respect to those",
          "Poignant and moving a period in time that should never be forgotten or allowed to be forgotten An excellent memorial to those who faced such inhumane treatment",
          "The monument looks like a labyrinth, which translates what anti-Semitism causes. Walking there I could feel the pain of the loss of several human generations.",
          "The memorial is very impressive, and really quite awe-inducing. It's sombre, as you'd expect. There is a museum but the queue was quite long. If you go, be prepared to lose yourself - and also watch out for very disrespectful people taking selfies.",
          "Not sure what to write. It is simply an absorbing place to visit. Strange that such an emotive subject is the subject of what appears, initially, to be a series of blocks.",
          "Highly recommend to put into context the events of the holocaust. Allow at least 2 hours to be able to make the most of the huge amount of information there is to read",
          "A tour of the visitor centre below the steelae explains the design of this thought provoking memorial . A very moving experience that should be compulsary education for young people .",
          "I visited this with an open mind, and wasn't disappointed. Its a huge field of stelae of all different heights closely packed over undulating terrain. Its worth walking into and around the claustrophobic centre to get a sense of the true confusion of the memorial. We didn't",
          "Apparently this monument was many years in the planning and approval. Thank goodness it was approved as it is an incredibly moving experience as well as being architecturally impressive. A good way to approach it is from the Brandenburg Gate corner and make your first journey",
          "This memorial is quite sobering. It\u2019s open to interpretation which makes you think even more. There are more than 2,000 concrete blocks and (according to our tour guide) no two blocks are the same.",
          "We visited the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe while we were in Berlin and were glad to have included it in our itinerary. It was haunting to look across the hundreds and hundreds of stone blocks while considering all that the Jews have endured. Definitely worth a visit",
          "The Holocaust Memorial is close to the Brandenburg Gate. It has 2,000+ grey slabs in a sloping plot at different heights and angles. There are rules for the site, like not standing in the slabs etc. There is a museum there too. We can learn from history.",
          "Visited as part of a walking town. An overwhelming place that\u2019s makes you feel enclosed. An interesting piece of art",
          "Telling the stories of the Holocaust with personal perspectives, family histories, letters and photographs. Very quiet and respectful. It is very sad and overwhelming but tells the story of how the holocaust affected so many families all over the world.",
          "A thought provoking memorial to the millions of members of the Jewish community murdered during the Holocaust. Would thoroughly recommend taking time to walk through the concrete blocks and reflect on the messages it drives to portray.",
          "Absolutely fantastic memorial. Beautiful and well thought out but what really makes it is the museum underneath. Just turn up, no reservation needed and it\u2019s totally free. Completely moving and very informative. It gave a full view of the war for those who know little and had",
          "Visit the information centre under the memorial to learn more about the history of the Jewish and Roma people in world war 2. It was very moving and informative.",
          "One of the many places visited by us whilst in Berlin, this memorial felt eerie and also very thought provoking,let us hope that something like this and what it stands for never happens again, peace to all.",
          "You will not leave this site unmoved. Hard to read the letters of the victims, but think everyone who visits Berlin needs to experience it.",
          "Great place and very nice don't forget to visit the underground museum. You can't skip this great piece of history.",
          "I didn\u2019t take as much time here as it was raining when I visited, but I would have liked to find (if it was available?) some information on the memorial. Very nice design.",
          "Very nice monument, pleasing architecturally to the eye. A must see when going to Berlin. A little isolated from the rest of the tourist objectives but nice to see.",
          "The design pays off in making you feel consumed by darkness, a very interesting concept for a memorial",
          "First, we had to queue in the rain to gain access down the stairs to the museum. Fitting, with the air of sombreness perhaps, but I felt sombre enough without getting drenched. The exhibits were low key - I especially liked the lit areas of floor where you could see enlarged",
          "This unique memorial in its scope and scale is very sobering. It is designed for reflection as well as impact and both are powerful.",
          "The Memorial for the Holocaust is a tribute to all the souls who were murdered in the yesteryears. The 2711 concrete blocks is a reminder of all theJewish victims form the era of World War 2. The museum underneath the memorial is also worth a visit. However it was a shame to",
          "The sculpture park is an amazing monument. But the museum underneath is where the emotion and power are at this memorial. It\u2019s a free museum and you have to wait a little but trust me it will be worth it. The museum lays out the timeline of the holocaust but also shares",
          "This Memorial for the Holocaust is a place that gives you a special feeling. With 2711 concrete blocks they remember the Jewish victims form WWII. Just walk around in silence. The entrance is free.",
          "A very sombre memorial to walk amongst and give thought to the events that made it necessary. Easy to find and lends itself well to secluding yourself from the city around you and reflecting on why this memorial is needed. The current world seems to be forgetting the horrors",
          "This is a very well done Memorial to Holocaust victims. The museum underneath is a must visit as past of getting the micro perspective on the effect on individual families. It is hard to grasp the tragedy as a whole, But the museum puts it into the perspective of the individual.",
          "A very different memorial but very significant. Lets not forget the terrible things that happened and make these places a reflection time and not a selfie time",
          "Interesting memorial, the stones represent whatever you want it to represent, there is a exhibition under the memorial free of charge,well worth seeing.",
          "Well worth taking 20 minutes out to walk through the memorial and contemplate human actions. All sound seems to disappear.",
          "I wasn't sure what to expect but this was a very good, calming exhibit. Although, we had to tell people to get off the stones as we felt it was disrespectful.",
          "The undulating landscape combined with the different size and height of the slabs give you a feeling of being completely disorientated.",
          "Worth a visit when in Berlin. Easy to get lost within. We walked through the memorial and really took in what it stood for.",
          "A memorial to the Holocaust, very modern in design, full of light and shadows, open to interpretation",
          "We learnt a lot about the effect of the holocaust on Jewish families. Really interesting learning about things I\u2019ve not learnt about before. Highly recommend",
          "I only knew of the external slabs and had no idea there was a whole information / exhibition of stories and explanation of what happened and individuals stories. Phenomenal",
          "We were surprised at the huge size of the Memorial and spent more time than we expected walking through it (it draws you in). The way the paths undulate through the variable stone is very creative, and in a different setting would almost seem whimsical--however the overall",
          "This art installation is simple and creepy at the same time. It's infuriating when you realise the horrors we permitted as humans.",
          "Emotive and powerful site to see and remember. Free to visit the memorial but there was long queues for the underground museum.",
          "Lovely cast memorial with good information on surrounding walls. Queue to get into free underground museum was huge do we didn\u2019t wait. Lots of lour OST\u2019s and tourist board there",
          "Spent lot of time at this memorial. Respectful and emotive time spent here. Very beautifully arranged columns and was clean.",
          "A surprising memorial. When you arrive you are struck with the thought - really that is it. I would encourage you to walk through it. The height of the blocks and the undulation of the paths will surprise you. Very clever memorial.",
          "This is a must-see, the monument is very imposing and important to remember and contemplate and not forget the holocaust.",
          "Strange in some ways, but walking through it, you forget you're in the middle of a big city and it goes weirdly quiet - unless you suddenly walk into someone crossing your path and jump a mile! Quite moving to walk through, and some good opportunities if you're into photography.",
          "This isn\u2019t the kind of place that you \u2018recommend visiting\u2019 in the normal sense but I do feel that everyone should go as history should be acknowledged and hopefully learnt from. We visited late afternoon as the final light of the day was disappearing. There were still a large",
          "From the pictures this does not look like a very interesting memorial BUT once you are there and walk thru the memorial you will take away a very profound experience. It is a must \"walk thru\" memorial.",
          "A quite extraordinary transition happens when you walk into and around within this monument. There are a few respectful rules written on the pavement outside but no explanations. Follow your own route through the monument to discover your feelings about the catastrophe that it",
          "Not making big impression. Maybe night time its better, but to be honest I am wondering why such monument are being constructed.",
          "Was disapointed with this as even though poignant felt the blocks of stone could be at least marble and maybe highlight the names of those who were deported from Berlin to be engraved would have meant more, got a feeling it was more of a modern art statement than a memorial",
          "This memorial site is highly impressive, mainly because of its size and simplicity - straight lines and grey cement. Walking among the many tombstones makes it an internal experience, unlike watching an exhibition in a museum.",
          "This was my first visit to Berlin. A friend of a friend who lives in Berlin took me to see the monument. I was not aware of the monument so I am glad he took me.",
          "This is a interesting place to visit, however I found the behaviour of some people very disrespectful for somehting that is a memorial to the dead!",
          "It is an intense emotional walk through this memorial. The only thing is the disrespectful people who are screaming and climbing the memorial... I'll never understand the lack of respect...",
          "It was so interesting to learn more about this topic and so important to be informed about the facts. Find a knowledgeable guide!",
          "Great place to have fun at all ages and have great vibe of games and enjoyment . Place to visit with friends and enjoy surroundings",
          "Another piece of art to make money for this city. Millions of people have been killed in the past years after World War 2, but no statue of piece of art for that.....a waste of space.",
          "Understated, moving experience. Important window into this historic time. Elie Weisel's quote at the entrance: \"It happened. Therefore it could happen again.\"",
          "The memorial is very poignant with a lot of hidden meanings to find for yourself. Appropriate and 100% worth a visit",
          "This is next to Brandenburg gate. I real labyrinth of monuments that you can wander through. It's somber and good to see that it is centrally located. My son's and I wandered through but if you have small children keep them close as you can get lost in here.",
          "Very impressive. We walked by this sight by night and were aware of the historical meaning of this sight. Recommend reading about this before visiting for sure. Bonus: we spotted a fox too.",
          "The pictures I had seen prior didn\u2019t do this monument justice. When you walk between the blocks the path Goes up and down (undulates). It\u2019s easy to feel isolated after a few turns. Really an eerie effect.",
          "The designer of this memorial has done a fantastic job. It is a very eerie sight and has been designed so as you can interpret the memorial however you like. Personally for me, the different sized concrete blocks made me feel very alone and lost. It\u2019s a poignant memorial and",
          "It's very powerful and beautiful memorial place. You feel sad when you come to this place and see this but I think its very important after all.",
          "To view this memorial from a distance it doesn\u2019t look all that interesting but you have to walk amongst the blocks to really immerse yourself in the place. This is a memorial to murdered jews - other memorials are in the area for other persecuted groups.",
          "This is a unique piece of art that you really must see and FEEL. Walk between the stones and see how it is closing on you, really amazing!",
          "This is a very surreal site to visit. While I was walking through the aisles in total silence, I could not begin to explain the feels I had. You need to go and visit to see and feel for yourself.",
          "Very well designed. A truly informative and emotional visit. The 2711 outside concrete slabs are placed in a way that creates a true reality of space and heights. The underground information center gives a true reality of the past events by giving a voice to all the victims.",
          "This is for the Field of Stelae. We'd just arrived on our first visit to Berlin and were walking to the Brandenburg Gates when we came across this memorial. Not knowing what it was in a way made it that much more powerful. It may not look like that much on the surface -a",
          "This memorial is a sight to see. The concrete slaps are of varying heights to conceal the undulating landscape. You can walk between them and disappear from view when there are dips in the land.",
          "Quite a place, no names just Stones like labyrint. Make me thinking all horrible things on Holocaust. Germany try to say, we are sorry and we will not forget it. I it good from them as a nation.",
          "It was nice to pay respects at the memorial and it is free of charge so you can have a wander round the concrete blocks. However the que for the inside museum section was over 45 minutes. If you are truly interested in ww2, I would recommend getting the train to visit the",
          "A very poignant stopping place along the tourist trail in Berlin. Follow the aisles and narrow passageways to find information about the history. Great for the kids to understand and put into context.",
          "i wandered upon this by chance. didn't know what it was, so got the feeling first and read about it later.",
          "I saw a post about this the day before I went about how it wasn\u2019t enough for A memorial and more was needed to Honour those who died. I thought - you can\u2019t please everyone. Having been today- it is definitely worth going and paying your respects. It\u2019s a somber place when you",
          "A really sad place. Reminder of the terrible past. Near the Brandenburg tower. I think we should all visit it and pay pur respects.",
          "Amazingly, this venue was right outside the back of our hotel. I had wanted to see it, and loved that we got to.",
          "Take your time in this moving place on entrance bags go through X-ray and visitors through metal detectors so it takes a little time - we put our coats in cloakroom that was free and also get the audio tour \u20ac3 -no fee to enter just a donation of you feel on exit I did not take",
          "Nice memorial which is interactive if you wish to walk in-between the 'pillars'. the ground is up and down, you can take some time to reflect...",
          "What an historical place to visit! I honestly had one problem, and thats the way people go there and take pics and stuff, its a memorial place and not a place where u go and use it for u blog or instagram.",
          "Not a great deal you can say apart from going to see the memorial yourself. Easily found from the Brandenburg gate.",
          "This a must for any history buff a well detailed and at times upsetting account of the holocaust done with personal stories and photographs",
          "The above ground memorial can seem a little odd the first time you visit it. All I ca n say is visit a few times and really try and explore how you feel walking amongst it. I would not recommend the underground memorial to children. It is a quiet place of reflection and noise",
          "Take a moment here when you are in Berlin. There is also a museum with tickets, located next to the memorial. It is an open area, without any timings.",
          "You dont understand the size of this memorial until you see it first hand. Very well designed, well worth a walk about.",
          "Very strange walking through all the monuments, I was glad we went to visit this memorial. Nice for a walk around",
          "Most people who come to Berlin as visitors, have read up the happening in the last 100 years if not more. The memorial is an art - every one relates to and appreciates it differently. Like any art piece spend a few minutes alone and take in the surroundings. Walk around immerse",
          "It is one of the highlights of Berlin. Walking between the big concrete stones give you the strong feeling of loneliness and in the same time you can always see the end. There is no place for two people to walk together, you must do it alone, and you can only imagine the way",
          "Visited with my teenage daughter and explained the historical significance of the memorial prior to entering. She understood, but it was rather disturbing to see that there were numerous young children running through the memorial like it was a park. Parents allowed them to run",
          "The Memorial is deceiving in size. It was recommended that we individually walk among the Memorial to elicit our feelings inspired by the Memorial. I highly recommend it. We thought it was lit up at night but it was not when we returned after dark.",
          "Rows of rectangular, unique stone slabs, each of different physical dimension. Artist left monument to\"open\" interpretation. For me, it brought out even more sadness, having just visited Auschwitz and Birkenau the day before.",
          "A different memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe. Many many blocks of stone as far as the eye can see. You can walk amongst them and there is lots of information. Really a place to stand and reflect what happened.",
          "The memorial evokes a complex set of emotions. No matter your place in history, or which side of the conflict you were on, the monument acts as a reminder to treat each other better. It lays out, starkly, the consequences of where ignorance and hate end up. The stones are",
          "If you visit Germany, you must include Holocaust Memorial in Berlin or Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe on your list. The world history has a significant impact to our lives. The whole area can make you feel the ambiance. I like to know the history of our world. It",
          "The memorial is definitely one of the must stops in Berlin if you are at all interested in history, specifically WWII. You can just swing through the memorial or there are many tour opportunities available should you want.",
          "It's a shame it is surrounded by blocks of flats overlooking the memorial. But very thought provoking anyway.",
          "Very interesting design. Take the time to walk through and reflect. The kids didn\u2019t quite understand but we can explain it more later.",
          "It was very nice to go.amazing place.i have not see something like that before. History building.it was monday and it was close but you can pass and to see the area",
          "The background as narrated by our guide Wouter was mind boggling. The memorial site is totally chilling. It brings a lump to your throat. The Holocaust was terrible beyond understanding. The memorial takes your breathe away. Hitler and his Nazis were a terrible people. A",
          "This should not have been some abstract memorial. This needed to show more respect to the jewish people. We don't need to look at this and think what the hell were they thinking. Not a smart memorial.",
          "It meant to be an abstract architectural design. That\u2019s what our tour guide told us. Definitely worth a walk inside the memorial...",
          "Took my mum here after I\u2019d already visited on previous trips. She\u2019s not a really \u201cmuseum\u201d type person but she thoroughly enjoyed (if that\u2019s the right word?) the exhibition and information centre below the memorial. Very moving.",
          "This Memorial is a reminder of the horror committed against Jews. While it lacks shock when viewed from the outer perimeter, the senses are provoked when wandering among the slabs as one gets deeper into the Memorial. When experienced in the dark, without crowds, it makes the",
          "It\u2019s very close to the Gate so it\u2019s easy to visit one together. Lots of blocks. Didn\u2019t excited me at all.",
          "It is essential that everyone that visits Berlin spends some time here, reflecting on what did happen and can happen under dictatorship regimes. Take time here and pause to remember all those innocent women, men and children that lost their lives during those dark times in",
          "The place is built up with many varied sizes of blocks with no plague, nothing. Probably to represent the many innocent dead at the time. It is a mark of respect to not step into the blocks to take photos, nor should you allow children to jump from it.",
          "The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe is located just behind the Brandenburg Gate. It is a monument dedicated to all the Jews who were lost during World War II.",
          "A very moving memorial, but go during the day or during daylight hours, as it's a very dark and scary place at night.",
          "Should definitely plan a visit here and spend some time, to take in the seriousness and the depth of the site..",
          "Try as I may I do not 'see' this collection of concrete blocks. The underground museum is more informative but the queues are very long.",
          "Great place to visit and pay respect. Free entry which is a plus side. We played hide and seek which was great! Would recommend",
          "This wonderful memorial is very close to Brandenburg Gate and visitors can wander through the maze of stones above ground designed to remember the victims of the Holocaust. A thought provoking place and very large. Do check out the underground area too for insightful information.",
          "Very important place to visit not only for Jewish , that show how horrible was the nazi Regime. As a visitor that almost all grandparents families were murdered at holocaust , the museum was very emotional for me.",
          "Very big memorial near the brandenburg gate. Not really much to say about it and we stumbled across it rather than deliberately came here. An interesting feature but not a \u2018must do\u2019.",
          "See how people suffered just because of their religion. This tracks the life of individual families through dark times. Education is the only answer to prevent these events from happening again. A must for young and old. An excellent presentation of historical facts. Put",
          "This place is just a must see, though it tells such a sad story. It is important not to forget how terribly a nation can act. Do not for\u00f8get that 6 mio judes got killed, homosexuals and Romas too. And final many with handicaps got eutanasi. I Think the memorial tells the story",
          "The cemetery-like memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin is a painful reminder of politics and power gone terribly wrong. Hundreds of lost lives and millions more condemned to oppressive guilt for centuries to come. Very sad.",
          "Was here yesterday. The underground museum does not open on Monday's which we didn't realise until we tried to get downstairs.",
          "Very good tribute to the poor people killed by the vile nazi regime. The exhibits have been put together very thoughtful and help portray the horrors faced by the Jews. We must never forget!",
          "You can feel the energy and the underground museum is just as sad. Didn't feel ok to take picture of what is a memorial to millions of lost lives.",
          "In the heart of Berlin, just a few steps from the Brandenburg Gate, there is this place of profound remembrance and never-ending warning, the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. On the site, open day and night, almost 3000 concrete slabs of different heights have been",
          "This is a must while in Berlin. It pays tribute to all the murdered Jews of Europe during WWII. The design is simple but impactive. There are 2711 slabs all the same size arranged slightly askew on a sloping field. There is a place of information underground which holds the",
          "Having visited the Topography of Terror exhibition I then walked past this memorial which made it all the more poignant. The sheer number of the concrete styles illustrated the huge number of victims of the National Socialist policies.It was very humbling and thought provoking.",
          "The displays and information in the underground memorial were excellent. I recommend spending the 3 euros for the audio guide. Very well done.",
          "Very very emotive! Reading some of the letters written by the Jews before they were lead or shot to their death broke my heart! I learnt a lot and did not realise the extent of the communities that were affected by the Germans and the concentration camps. Aside from the",
          "Visited this memorial and, whilst I could see it was beautiful and haunting, I couldn\u2019t see any explanation. I didn\u2019t know there was a museum underneath and that would have been good to visit :-(",
          "There are not really enough words or time to write a review that this Memorial deserves. It is incredibly well done, well thought out and forces the person who looks upon to be silent and think. A must see",
          "This is a beautiful, sad, symbolic, yet very real tribute to the murdered Jews of the European holocaust. It represents the enormity of the crime, and also makes it very personal. With all the nationalism occurring worldwide, remembrance of the devastation caused by hate is a",
          "This is the ultimate memorial of \"mans' inhumanity to man\". It is incredible to think of the 6+ million Jews slaughtered by the Nazi Regime in the name of \"cleansing\". We must never let this happen again!",
          "came upon this memorial whilst on walking tour. had a wander around and thought of what it represented.",

          "Just next to US embassy, a very impressive sight,it is massive aswell, bigger than i expected. While i wandered through (not that easy) i was lost in thought.",
          "This is not just a place to visit. No place for sheer voyeurism but an experience which should test your values to the core. And as you exit the place you will realise that you are a different person from the one who entered thr memorial. Shalom",
          "To simply scratch the surface and be appreciate of this memorial - walk into it, up and down the paths, look at the angles of the blocks, the sky, the distance and at the various pathway block patterns. It aids reflection.",
          "Visited here today. Looks like lots of stone blocks similar to a graveyard. Very good memorial to the many Jews murdered. Worth a visit whilst in Berlin. Enjoyed the walk.",
          "We were in a hurry so didn't have the time this memorial deserves. It's a lot bigger what you'd expect. I felt fellow tourists were acting a bit inapproperiately taking smiley selfies and posing for Instagram-worthy pics, concidering this IS a memorial to all brutally murdered",
          "Great information of what had happened to the Jewish. The memorial is well designed. Must visit in Berlin.",
          "During our trip to Berlin we walked from Brandenburg gate to the Holocaust memorial which was less than 5 minutes away. This is worth going to see, however you dont need to assign much time to it.",
          "Very cool illustration to honor the murdered Jews of WW2. The size and shape of it makes you think and feel things, it\u2019s like a secret power. It\u2019s free of charge",
          "Its very near the brandenburg gate so do have a walk through the stones. Im not sure what they represent but to me it was like grave stones. I done some reading up on the site and stumbled upon some other interesting finds that are near by, no longer there or covered over but",
          "This was on our list of things to see. It was very sobering just to wander around the blocks. The one thing that struck us was how quiet it was considering that there was traffic all around. There was a stillness and quietness that really made one think . Definitely a must for",
          "The name of this memorial is very intentional, according to our local, private guide. It is a memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe. It is Germany's very public acknowledgment of the horrors that the Nazi regime inflicted particularly on the Jews. The architect of the memorial",
          "I would suggest a visit by this memorial. It is important for anyone to visit. Seeing it in person really has great power. I wish the museum had been open when we went by, but I forgot to check the hours. I would certainly suggest a visit.",
          "An interesting post modern reflection of the tragic history and atrocities which happened during the Nazi period during WWII, the blocks reminded me so much of the graves as well as grave stones for every murdered Jews and it's simplicity and symmetry provide a sobering link to",
          "This was part of the tour however had seen it the day before. You make your own interpretation re the memorial",
          "A wide open space with the installation leaving its message for the viewer to decide. For me the grey pillars and differing sized pillars represented those who were ripped from their lives and had their lives deemed insignificant and not worthy of it. I was taught about it,",
          "important place to visit. mixed emotions walking among the taller stones as I walked through them; anxiety of the unknown journey, unsure there the light has gone and if there is light at the end of the tunnel. future generations must not forget mans inhumanity to man.",
          "It is a huge monument. Very impressive to see and to read the history and reasons why this memorial is made.",
          "This was a vert special place to walk amongst. It has a very poignant meaning and makes the visitor think deeply. The walkways between each stone are very quiet even though you are on a main road",
          "It is a very emotional place as it's a time for reflection however you get teenagers running around screening which I found disrespectful. However the memorial is very well done and it's just down the road from the Brandenburg gate so if your in that area definitely see it.",
          "Do go, have a walk both around and through the 2700+ concrete pillars of varying sizes. I would recommend and early or late visit in the hope of missing the hoards of coach visitors as some of them, when I visited, were quite disrespectful and treated the memorial like a maze to",
          "The underground exhibit is excruciatingly poignant. Germany is facing its past unflinchingly. This is well worth the wait.",
          "Its just a stones but the energy there is somehow mystical. Worth the visit 1000%. I think in summer time its even better :)",
          "Went to this place at night and it felt quite emotional walking through it at night Was close to the Brandenburg gate",
          "You should take the tour inside the information center. It's very impressive. They let in 8 people each time due to the security check.",
          "This the second time I have visited this site. My husband and I found it very moving. We didn\u2019t realise about the free museum otherwise would have done that also.",
          "This is definitively worth going to, and some people don't realise there is free museum which is below the monument closer to the back of the memorial. It is a good reminder about the horrors that happened in Europe",
          "Didn't find this interesting or inspiring in the least. Ugly display of concrete blocks, total waste of time",
          "The sheer size and dedication of this memorial is amazing. It feels like a graveyard, but so much more. It is a structure that cannot but inspire emotion - no signs, you make your own opinions, which really makes you think about all those poor souls and how they felt. Truly",
          "I guess like all \u201cart\u201d it\u2019s all about how you see it. This was not what expected, and in truth it was just weird. Interesting though and a great thought behind it",
          "Worthwhile having a look and wondering through this memorial. Very moving memorial and thought provoking.",
          "This a very unique location for a remembrance of a horrible time in NAZI -Germany. The monument is on a special place in the middle of Berlin. In an area where all the bad happened. This location is well known and almost every visitor is impressed and it seems, that everybody is",
          "You cannot help feeling emotional when you visit here. Just trying to imagine all the pain and suffering associated with each and every block and the museum displays is awe inspiring. A must to visit.",
          "A large open air memorial close to Brandenburger Gate and Potzdamer platz. Free to walk around. The museum itself is under the memorial.",
          "Really moving and different from any other Holocaust museum. Split into sections. The audio guide gives you a great overview and makes sure that you don't miss anything. You can go at your own pace and decide if something is too much for you and skip over those parts. Really",
          "What I got from this interesting piece is, it is 'overwhelming' to attempt to walk along every pathway within the structure, past every block of various sizes, height and material used. It would be overwhelming to try and understand every victim of the holocaust and their",
          "Noticed this on the Hoho bus route to Brandenburg Gate, walked back to have a look. Eerie, sombre place, quite a moving tribute to the people who lost their lives in the holocaust.",
          "We first saw this memorial when on a walking tour and had a brief talk about it, before we walked through it ourselves. You lose your sense of perspective and it\u2019s a bit like a maze when you are \u2018in\u2019 it. It made me feel lost and a bit overwhelmed. The slabs I thought represented",
          "Went here as part of a walking tour. It appears very simple from the outside but as you walk amongst it you begin to understand its design. It's very carefully designed to make you think. I would recommend spending a few minutes here when in Berlin.",
          "Powerful memorial that is worth visiting. Its free and does not take long to visit. Make a stop here and take in what you are seeing.",
          "When you look at this memorial from the street, it looks like a bunch of slabs. Once you walk into the memorial between the stones, you begin to appreciate its complexity. I read several reviews of this place prior to visiting it where people mentioned others climbing on the",
          "A place of deep meaning. Do take time to visit the underground museum. The memorial is walking distance away from the Brandenburg Gate.",
          "Such a powerful memorial! Spending time to reflect on the victims. We must never forget! Nor let this happen again!",
          "Walked here after visiting the Brandenburg Gate and took a peaceful, contemplative stroll around this moving memorial. Definitely worth a stop off.",
          "Berlin is rich in history and learn about the Holocaust is important for humanity. There's a lot of information at this site. It's good to go with some time to spare to be able to read about the victim's and their life history.",
          "The place is next to the Jewish Memorial. Entrance and backpack storage is free of charge. There is some security at the entrance but nothing troublesome. The place has clean toilets too. They have done a good job in documenting the details of the horror. Not recommended for",
          "For some people this will be important for others not so. I personally didn't rate it high on my tour. The main thing I would comment on is beware of pick pockets in this area. They especially utilise groups of children so keeps valuables safe at all times.",
          "From the top the stone pillars are an artistic representation of the scale - underneath these walking through the various galleries and reading the real life stories of individuals and families brings that scale down to a personal level.",
          "Didn't go here deliberately - happened upon it while strolling from Postdamerplatz to Brandenburg Gate. Reflect on what this means, and where it is - the attempted destruction of an entire people in the heart of a great city, a site created from the destruction from air and by",
          "Went to this memorial with the Original Berlin Walks tour company guided by Sam Z - Sam let us walk around this memorial letting us give our feelings/feedback at the end of it. The way he lead this tour to this memorial was quite special, excellent!",
          "Its a very moving stark exhibit that reinforces this period of our history that recognizes this time in our history.",
          "Looks nothing until you start to walk in amongst the stones and look down long corridors of huge uneven slabs (of the 2,700 no two are the same) and a feeling of emptiness and sadness. You see someone pass and never again in your life - this to remind us of what happened to so",
          "Well, we had our own tour guide as we were quite a large group that came over to Berlin for our Christmas do. So we had his interpretations of this monument that was created around the 2000s as a remembrance and known to the locals as an apology, why so late and why these is",
          "The idea of these structures is very nice. However it is not as impressive as I thought. It did not gave you a strong feeling of rememberance.",
          "I will be the first to say that just looking at the pictures did not do it for me. I really didn't \"get\" the memorial...until I walked through it. The size of it was surprising to me. Walking through it, with the hilly and off kilter ground, and those slabs looming over you,",
          "This Holocaust Memorial is one of Berlin\u2019s most important sites. It is beautifully and movingly presented.",
          "Of course you should visit this Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. What a devastating situation to mark with a memorial- you can interpret it as you wish. Great underground museum to learn more about 15 families and their experiences in WWII and during the Holocaust.",
          "The memorial itself is above ground and there is an information centre below the memorial. The opening sentence says it all - it happened once, it can happen again. This information centre is free although if you want the headphones, these cost 3 euros. It takes you through the",
          "This is a stark reminder of a dark period of German history. However, no monument or memorial will ever salve the suffering of so many families. A visit here will cause on the think long and hard of the terrible events of the 1940's.",
          "A worthy tribute to all those that perished at the hands of evil. It was fitting that the sky was overcast and gray while walking through the monolith's just a short distance away from the Brandenburg Gate. Open to interpretation, it is worth pausing to reflect on the evil that",
          "Worth a visit. Large area without a description so lots to interpret. Lots of people but does not feel crowded.",
          "The Holocaust Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe is a monument it is a monument you need to explore and walk around it to reflect in this sad period of mankind. A life is a life! Doesnt matter religious beliefs. Walking trough this monolithic pieces you will definitely",
          "Visiting here is humbling, sad, reflective and different. It\u2019s also well worth your time. There are many interpretations of this tribute and mine isn\u2019t important to the discussion or to my review. What is important is that you make time to walk thru here. Put whatever meaning",
          "Incredible piece of art that really evokes emotion. Don't just walk around the edges-- in the middle the pillars can be way over your head. Sad to see so many people climbing and disrespecting the monument. I found it a very powerful experience.",
          "It was a very emotional time of our trip to Berlin. This is a very powerful place, full of history, sadness and respect. We had a lot of mixed feelings about this place.",
          "this memorial from a distance looks quite plain, but as you go through it , particularly in the evenings, is a little bit eerie but also emotionally stirring as it almost immediately brings a sense of the tragic events that have happened leading upto to it. Must visit for anyone",
          "You have to go see this to get the feeling it brings you after walking through all these large stones, and the number of individuals that could have said, \"NO\" to hitler and to the Nazis, everyone who did anything that involved the killing of the jews, might have started out",
          "Our guide explained that the blocks were to symbolise the different sizes, shaped and backgrounds of the victims of the Holocaust. It was a grey overcast day when we visited and that seemed to set the mood for this memorial",
          "We went through here at night -- somber and a bit scary, all those spirits still around, it seems. And yes, it's safe at night -- we're not talking about NYC, DC, or Chicago here.",
          "It's free and easy to locate in Berlin. Just on the corner after Brandenburg gate. So many sad and painful stories of the holocaust. Pictures, real stories, diaries, audiovisuals etc. It's definitely a place to visit while in Berlin.",
          "Close to brandenburger tor and the park, this should be on your list in berlin. The blocks do not look much, but enter them and you will find yourself in a bit of a maze. If you have kids, its good to remind them before entering that this is a memorial, but it is actually good",
          "Visited as part of a walking tour, we were asked to walk in on our own and walk around. Our guide asked us how we felt what did we experience and then we had a discussion on his take on the memorial. This brought the horror to life so to speak and we understood it better and to",
          "It is a place of tragedy in history, however many people forget about it and behave outrageously in this place. Please remember, it is a place to commemorate once many people's death",
          "Between Potsdamer Platz and Brandemburg Door, it's a simple but effective memorial to not let the History fade away.",
          "We visited the memorial in May current year. The entrance is free of charge, therefore you can spend several minutes of half hour to admire the memorial, if you love history and you are passionate about WWII. The memorial consists in hundreds of stone blocks which symbolizes the",
          "No one should visit Berlin without visiting this memorial. I can\u2019t elaborate. Just go there and then reflect.",
          "Center was closed for renovations but above ground was quite thought provoking. Very eerie at night.",
          "It means different things to each person. To me it showed how there were all sorts of people and the awfulness of what happened.",
          "It\u2019s so difficult visiting memorials because if the world was a better place they would not be needed. The variable concrete columns that tower above you here are haunting and grief- inducing. If you go at night it\u2019s quiet and very sombre.",
          "It\u2019s free. A queue forms at the top of the stairs. Takes a while to gain entry as everyone is searched. Lots of information. Especially liked how it showed different families and awful things that happened to them. Made the terrible events more easy to relate to.",
          "During the Free Tour (by Sandeman) we also walked by this memorial. The guide made us walk through and encouraged us to think about what the creator meant with this memorial. After doing so, we talked about it. It gave a lot of depth to this memorial. Besides information it also",
          "This was the most incredible and moving museum I\u2019ve ever been to. I don\u2019t get emotional easily, but I struggled to hold back tears for pretty much the entirety of the visit. The museum is so beautifully designed and thought out. On top of that, it\u2019s free admission (but rent the",
          "Hard to believe in the center of Berlin a great reminder of our past. It very simple but effective design. You must visit the museum below the Memorial to continue to understand the impact of this tragedy. As sad and moving this is and represents you must go and experience and",
          "Nice museum.Interesting. Not the best I've ever been to by a long shot but nice. The outside columns are interesting.",
          "Amazing installation let\u2019s hope history never repeats its self. So many people died needlessly and cruelly",
          "Blocks of square a lots, from north to south and from east to west if you stand in the center of the blocks you will have the spectacular view, yet it is the place to remember that how the cruel of the war make the people suffer.",
          "Admittedly, I have not been inside the museum, which is underground. I have spent time wandering around the upper/outside museum with the irregular sized blocks. Fun may not be the right word to use when talking about a memorial dedicated to a decidedly tragic part of human",
          "Second visit to the memorial and no less moving than the first. A well laid out and informative experience. Still shocks the enormity of what happened, incomprehensible.",
          "This memorial to the Jews who died in the holocaust is absolutely to scale considering the millions who lost their lives so brutally. It is large yet can feel small, the rows and rows of stone slabs are all around you and you can feel the reason they are there.",
          "We could see this while visiting the Reichstag and it is easily within walking distance. It is a somber place like Holocaust Museum in DC and the Memorial De La Shoah in Paris. It makes a perfect bookend to the visit to the Dachau that we did later in the trip. My only sad",
          "Very moving and sombre. Take time to pause and remember. Its a fabulous memorial - very appropriate.",
          "Walking through the blocks it will make one very clear how does it feel to be captured and trapped without knowing what is going to happen.",
          "The information centre and audio is well presented. Brings the horror to life in telling personal stories.",
          "We visited this as part of the walking berlin tour, so poignant and thought provoking to look at and over looks the reichstag",
          "OK, most public spaces invite a playful and joyous time. But here at the \"Holocaust Memorial\" it seems some solemnity is called for. The late afternoon of our recent visit, there were lots of kids innocently playing some version of hide and seek in the welter of pillars;",
          "At first I wasn\u2019t sure what to make if it but as you wander the paths between the blocks the power of the memorial hits you. A place for thought and contemplation but also a place to remind us of the tremendous suffering, of the lives lost, and families destroyed by hatred and",
          "visited during the evening. the lights were not working sadly. there is a small plaque that explains what what it commemorates, so you should read up on it beforehand if you don't already know.",
          "The memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe is a huge very modern sculpture to honor victims of the Nazi Holocaust. After long and controversial discussions who should be remembered (only the Jewish Holocaust victims or all Holocaust victims) in 2 competitions the design of",
          "I visited the Holocaust Memorial during a short stop in Berlin, and it was well worth visiting. The memorial is unusual in that it sort of resembles a graveyard with rows of concrete blocks forming a grid. There is a total of 2711 blocks, and you can walk between them in any",
          "It may just look like a load of concrete blocks, but the scale and what it represents creates quite a moving experience. WE didn't have time to queue to go inside however.",
          "We visited as part of a walking tour, and our guide explained that the memorial is designed for everyone to interpret the work of art for themselves. There is really no way of expressing the horror of the holocaust and I\u2019m not sure that this piece does that either, but it",
          "This is a very interesting architecture. Done to replicate burial sights in Israel. Take time to walk through it.",
          "If you are in the area it's something that everyone should see and experience. Just take a little time out of your day and do it. Some things should live with you forever.",
          "Well worth a visit ,quite a thought provoking site. Time to reflect and consider the past. A site not to be missed",
          "Nothing but a bunch of blocks but let your imagination run wild. A place to go to think and possibly recollect or put your inner thoughts into perspective.",
          "I went to visit the Holocaust memorial and museum. The celebration of the end of the war in Europe has touched me and brought back memories of my family who did their part in the war but now no longer with us. I hear there are a group of people called Holocaust denial. Within",
          "No question the memorial reminds of millions of humans that suffered from nazi terror in the darkest years of Germany. It is more than relevant to be reminded what ideology and terror might cause. In terms of architecture and information this is a place to see: Very close to",
          "I'm not sure that a star rating is quite appropriate. But visiting the memorial is a very moving and sibering experience. It's nuts what we can do to each other.",
          "Not to much word is for speak about this. You have to be there , give time, stay and loss in silent , loss among the tombs labyrinth",
          "Such a memorial could have been over-sentimentalized. It isn't. It is stark. Words aren't needed. Yet it speaks volumes. The monoliths, which cover several acres, are all of different heights and sizes. The stone walks between them undulate. It's interesting as well as",
          "I am not sure what we expected but the you need to visit without trying to understand what the designer was intending and just allow your thoughts to come naturally. We didn't have time to visit the museum which is located under the memorial so do allow some time for that as",
          "Everyone should visit this just to remember, and hopefully have the same reaction as me, so it doesn\u2019t happen again",
          "Did not see the inside/downstairs of the monument due to crowds, but reading and walking around the area was tough to do",
          "An amazing artistic representation of the Jewish experience during the Holocaust. Definitely visit the info centre too!",
          "This was def on my bucket list of must sees when in Berlin and it didn't disappoint. Immerse yourself amongst the stones and feel the quiet and reverence. I was brought to tears. So moving.",
          "This is the best public work of art (and memorial) I've experienced. The scale and disorientation, when wandering amongst the blocks, works perfectly. It is eerie but moving - the conceptual element is very clever, without being clunky or patronising. Visiting the Bundestag",
          "Interesting memorial. It doesn\u2019t look that impressive from the edges but when you walk through it it creates a completely different feel and is peculiarly somber.",
          "It is a powerful experience coming to this monument. A mix of emotions but also hope for the future. May we never forget and never allow this to happen again. Definitely worth a visit and just a short walk from the Brandenburg gate.",
          "Just go. It's beautiful and haunting despite the people who use the installation as a seat or somewhere to eat lunch.....",
          "A very moving architectural installation. You can walk through the blocks, each of which represents the pages of the Torah, which are different heights and set on an undulating slope on the corner of a block near the Brandenburg gate. There is a museum underground, which",
          "I didn't find the idea of small grey blochhaus very kind for such a memorial wthout any name. Not the most interresting thing in Berlin",
          "Queued up not too long to go in it's free admission. Includes obvious information on everything and individual personal family stories too.",
          "You should know that most of the internal museum is a lot of reading 9n case you go with children. Overall it is very impressive and interesting.",
          "One must visit this impressive memorial to appreciate the art installation and what it stands for Very clever Very moving",
          "I am not Jewish, but this place will really takes you; this Memorial architecture is done in a way that slowly you will walk in the middle of hundreds of stones blocks...gives you a weird feeling ; very impressive.",
          "We stopped at memorial during a walking tour. The memorial is designed tastefully to commemorate the holocaust victims.",
          "a very special and unique memorial cite. lately it seems like visitors don't really understand the meaning of it, and look 'happy' to just get a 'selfy'. please get some infprmation or guidence before your visit, to be able to respect the victims... good to visit after seeing",
          "At first glance this site appears quite strange. Then when you move among its stones you feel immediately emotional.",
          "The blocks are not set on level land and because of this you can see people seemingly disappear as they walk through the memorial. The building in the background of the photo is the American Embassy and from, and there it's a very short walk to the Brandenburg Gate.",
          "Somewhere everybody should go during their stay in Berlin. It really makes you think about what happened during the war. As our guide said you can read many things into the memorial and its significance.",
          "A place that starts your thinking. Works for adults and kids. Beautiful in itself, but also raises questions: What do the concrete blocks symbolize, why are they lined up, why are they different in height? Fascinating place...",
          "Thought provoking Holocaust Memorial, a quiet place to stop and think about your own interpretation of the memorial. Definitely worth a visit",
          "Like most sites of a similar nature in Berlin this memorial is free to enter but donate if you can. I like that they ensure that the past is accessible to everyone as this is a part of history that must never be forgotten. The museum beneath the concrete memorial is very",
          "As soon as you walk into the attraction, you can feel the significance of the space. It was really moving and it such a clever monument. Each person takes away from it what they think/feel.",
          "Chilling monument. It was very well done and the interpretation a visitor is bound to come to is pretty universal if they know what they are visiting. A must...perhaps a brief one, but a must.",
          "It's a thought provoking memorial. Some people meander through reflectively while others let their children run rampant. There are people guarding to ensure no one climbs on top. It's very busy but once you walk inside it it's not as noticeable. Definitely worth the stop.",
          "Unusual memorial that you won\u2019t forget, which is the whole point, whether you like it or not. There is more to it than you think as it covers a larger area than you can see initially and also it goes deep in the centre, giving it a claustrophobic sort of feeling too, reminiscent",
          "Its very close to the the Brandenburg gate so well worth a visit. Its very important to have a memorial such as this and the outside area is very moving. However the actual museum is very dark and foreboding and while the message must not be lost it is very sad and my 14 year",
          "Really heart breaking. Must visit when you're in Berlin. I recommend to go there when the sun goes down...",
          "Unfortunately people forget what this memorial is meant to be. Not a place for posed selfies, not a place for jumping from stone to stone or playing chasing around the blocks. The people in charge of the area were having a difficult time controlling the groups - and it wasn\u2019t",
          "Spent a while wondering around the memorial. Really somber atmosphere. A must visit site in berlin recommend.",
          "Suggest you take time to visit this thought provoking and well thought out monument if time permits.",
          "For the memory of all those people who have died, this place is simple, quiet and have a lot of feelings.",
          "The memorial depicted the horror of the holocaust by invoking images of caskets and a graveyard to represent the many people who died. Was touching in its simplicity with how the boxes were arranged.",
          "My wife and I were truly moved by this \"monumental\" Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, also called the Holocaust Memorial. The huge city block houses 2,711 concrete \"stelae\" blocks , every single one of which is a different size, symbolizing the uniqueness of every person",
          "It is a special atteactio, there is not much to see per se, it is more about the feeling. You enter the maze and come out somewhat different person.",
          "We were able to soak up the calm atmosphere at the Holocaust Memorial. Its haphazard design reflects the horror and chaos of the extermination of the Jews in Europe. You are also pointed towards other similar memorials to those persecuted last century: the Roma and homosexuals.",
          "This is a large memorial which brings home the numbers involved in the holocaust. It is well worth visiting and remembering all the terrible acts committed against the Jews in many European countries. A hard place to visit, but worthwhile.",
          "The distinctive images/ impressions I had beforehand of this memorial were photos of people smiling and posing (to the extent of climbing etc) on social media. Added with the backlash comments in relation to respect. When I stood afar, it didn't really affect me, but as soon as",
          "Despite there being quite a few people here it was eerily quiet. A very moving memorial & interesting. It is well worth visiting & discovering the history behind it.",
          "The holocaust memorial is like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen before, very important part of German history displayed in a very architectural manner, must see attraction.",
          "We visited in a group as part of the amazing Sandemans 3-Hour free walking tour. The memorial is very touching and has a beautiful and original design. Make sure you spend some minutes in this memorial!.",
          "Appreciate that this is called the \"Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe\" Clearly no one is hiding from their past. A very moving tribute, marred only by the lack of understanding and behavior of foreign tourists.",
          "It covers an impressive area and is unusual but it needed more of something but I am not sure what. Walking through the blocks atmospheric and maze like. Some of the blocks appear to be cracking. Heard a tour guide warning guests not to engage in conversation with anyone",
          "Amazing museum, very thought provoking. Albeit a little over crowded. Worth the queue. Harrowing, sad, shocking",
          "Came across this memorial almost accidently whilst walking around Berlin. Not much in the way of explanatory notes anywhere but a little bit different from many memorials. Good photo opportunities but also a significant monument to the genocide perpetuated by the Germans",
          "What an impressive sight and what a big monument. I was really quiet for a moment. And without losing respect for what I write now; It is a pity that something big is made for 1 group. This could have been greater if the remembrance were for a larger whole. A lot has happened in",
          "We have visits many Holocaust Memorials and this is one of the best. Tells many stories in a lovely quiet and respectful setting. I only wish the school kids going through the exhibits while we were there showed a little more reverence and respect. Highly recommend this",
          "Loved this memorial. Looking at it you may not think it's very interesting but once you start walking to the other side it is very enlightening. High recommend checking this memorial out and see what you think and feel while there.",
          "It large stone like structures that resemble coffins and monoliths present a stark contrast. The memorial is immersive, allowing you to walk along its corridors that cast shadow and light. The floor undualtes creating a wave of concrete. The maze like monoliths see children",
          "Very moving and fascinating architectural piece of genius 2711 pieces of individual blocks open to individual interpretation. Must be walked through to understand",
          "This artist purposefully leaves the memorial up to interpretation so don\u2019t be afraid to engage in conversation at this important monument.",
          "Visited this memorial and found it very moving. The columns on the surface are simple but not as impressive as the museum underground which is amazing, absolutely essential viewing. We met some people who missed the museum and simply saw the columns because they didn't notice",
          "Couldn't go far into this memorial, as I found it as it was meant to be, very moving. There is an information centre underneath, but I didn't see it.",
          "Actually it does not get too crowded because the number of people allowed into the museum is restricted. It's a very simple but effective memorial. Whilst we liked the undulating floor and differing heights the blocks are in a straight line and we thought it would have been",
          "This landmark is one of the best in Berlin, highly recommended. Also you need to know the reason behind building the memorial like this, extremely meaningful...",
          "This memorial is right next to the Topography of Terror so it is easy to take in. I spent some time walking through it by myself trying to clear my mind. I wanted the memorial to speak to me and it did. A very thoughtful place.",
          "This is another monument to the horrific events during WWII. I was very surprised to find out there were over 2400 actual blocks depicting the different people of diff backgrounds, religious faiths, sexual orientation and all other things that differentiate us as human beings.",
          "This is a very powerful memorial. All European politicians should have to visit before they can take up office. A must visit.",
          "Absolutely worth a trip as free and takes your breath away if you walk solo. There is a museum but a long queue.",
          "I would recommend taking the time and visiting this memorial. It's quite powerful and worth the time to view it. It can get crowded but they manage the people entering quite nicely.",
          "Never seen anything like it. Grey, black, different levels of the coffins, reminding in a way how terrible persecution can be.",
          "A striking visual and experiential representation of the distortion of human order that led to the atrocities of the Jewish people. Especially haunting and dizzying once you find yourself lost within the maze of walls. I only wish it weren't surrounded by so much noise and",
          "Very good place to visit and extremely moving and so sad. Well worth spending a few hours here as it has a huge amount of details in the museum.",
          "We visited this memorial and it\u2019s museum on our visit to Berlin. Such a start reminder of the atrocities and violence on the European Jews, Roma and Sinka. The memorial leaves you wondering what the designer was representing everyone has their own theories and incame away with",
          "I recommend on visiting the Museum and learn about the Atrocities and Holocaust of the Jewish people. walk through the Memorial and take the Moment to Remember the innocent victimes slaughtered by the Nazis.",
          "Impressive monument. Me and my teen were talking about all the lost chilren, teens,adults...all lost live. Heatbreaking. Still, we must remember, so we can try to stop this happening again.",
          "The memorial symbolize the sea of the graves of the victims of holocaust. Walking among the \"graves\" is really oppresive, but I think, teh\u00e1t is have to be like this.",
          "This is a very moving memorial, it makes you think how the Jews suffered and is a way the Germans are saying sorry.",
          "I visited this memorial this month right in front of American Embassy in Berlin. Great with families and kids but take note the many corridors can hide children. Its located very well next to many other tourist attractions like the Tiergarten, Reichstag Building, and so many",
          "We stopped at this location on our hop on hop off tour. It was an amazing place to visit and see. It is well worth walking around to and walking into, just to see what has been created.",
          "I came here with my friend and it was eerie but in a good way. The artists really captured the mood superbly.",
          "When you look at all these memorials it brings it home as to how the Jews suffered. This is the Germans way of saying sorry to all those murdered.",
          "The concept behind this installation is admirable. At a quiet time, the experience can be sombre and haunting, but unfortunately, when I went, many children and teenagers were treating it as a playground - often as their parents sat nearby and ate and drank. Tbh, as a child,",
          "Berlin is a city with so much history... this holocaust memorial is a must visit site. It\u2019s very overwhelming and depressing. Be mindful of the world history and make sure we learn from it.",
          "A moving memorial. An absolute must if you visit Berlin. Allow plenty of time for the underground memorial museum. So moving.",
          "Take the time to walk through the memorial, not just around the edge. It is only by going down into the memorial that you get the full impact. It is not possible to see from the side but the ground actually dips down in various directions. Go at a quiet time to be able to",
          "Great memorial for such a horrendous tragedy. The whirlwind of emotions you go through is humbling and a good reminder of the past. Go see it.",
          "We visited at a busy time and decided not to wait the 30 mins to get into the visitor centre. Slightly disturbed by the number of visitors showing no respect - saw someone doing a handstand with their feet on two of the concrete pillars which I found really disrespectful. Also",
          "May the current and future generation learn so history will never repeat itself again. The personal writings of those who died during the Holocaust. It is sad to read on what goes through one's mind when they know what will happen to them.",
          "You are confronted by massive concrete mausoleum style grey blocks of varying heights. It is interesting how the higher the blocks are the lower you go ground wise. Berlin does not hide its history.",
          "Dropped off by coach at memorial - sense of awe and history when walking through the passageways - very clever sculpture idea.",
          "Very interesting concept of a memorial and would not be everyone's thing but if deeply thought about really good. What's most off putting is people don't get it and its a selfie heaven.",
          "When you see it, is something great and if you know a little of the story you will appreciate it more",
          "Impressed by how Germans continue to educate and remind the world of the atrocities committed against the Jews.",
          "We visited this memorial whilst in Berlin. It is an amazing sight and its stark - almost bleak - style is a sad reminder of what it stands for. Berlin city council is to be commended for enabling this monument to be built on such a large portion of inner city land. You can't",
          "Concrete Blocks are somehow effective in creating a atmosphere of scale! Had to queue for 45 minutes due to large number of school groups who arrived but was worth every minute of the wait once inside. Imaginatively created and you cannot fail to be impacted by the scale and the",
          "It\u2019s like a labyrinth where you are never sure what\u2019s around the corner, the terrain is uneven adding to your uncertainty, provokes lots of thinking.",
          "Visually stunning memorial to the murdered Jews of the Holocaust. The cement blocks are intriguing and disconcerting. The museum below even more so. It will stay with you, as it should.",
          "Very somber and though provoking. Great piece of art and architecture. Allow enough time to visit the underground display, the better part with the real information. How anyone could doubt the tragedy of the events is unfathomable.",
          "A most moving, real and yet very abstract memorial. . Eery to walk and get to lost between the high stones. . A must see and experience.",
          "Organised tour of \u2018The Cold War in East Berlin\u2019 with a good dollop of the military history/background to the era. So a visit to this memorial was definitely on the itinerary. It is very controversial and has had a whole range of reactions to it. I liked it very much. Very",
          "A moving reminder of the horrors of the holocaust but all in subtlety. Really recommend going to this place. The scale of the place and the impression it creates upon you can not be represented on any pictures. You really have to be there.",
          "A must do when visiting Berlin. We did the Sandmans walking tour and he filled us in on what we were seeing. There are no signs telling you what it is at all. Our guide said that signs could potentially attract neo Nazis and demonstrations. It's a memorial to the 6 million",
          "A memorial to the Jews killed during the war. Rows of blocks symbolize the number of Jews killed. Walk down and the blocks tower over your head. Solemn memorial.",
          "It is a memorial of great sadness of course and hope fully a warning to prevent these things happening again. however the world has not learnt and the killing goes on. We found it a place of reflection and prayer",
          "This artwork makes a statement about the holocaust but in itself isn't great art in my opinion. I was disappointed that people sat on some of the blocks forming the artwork and didn't treat it with due respect.",
          "A very peaceful and lovely memorial, im glad I had the chance to see it. What surprised me the most was the people taking selfies in this memorial, if you do get the chance to visit please be respectful. its a moment out of your day to respect and remember those that suffered",
          "Walking though the the Holocaust memorial gives you time to reflect. It was a sad experience but needed to be done to understand how the Jewish community of Germany suffered q And the rest of Europe\u2019s Jewish community suffered under these darks times of Germany. History",
          "We were impressed by this! The monument are so smooth and it is so interesting to walk between them. What I think it is a must for this area is someone to keep an eye because so many stupid people are walking on the monuments and this is the biggest lack of respect in my",
          "A different, but impressive memorial honoring the Jewish people murdered during WW2. What was extremely disturbing though was people taking selfies and even making funny poses when taking pictures, please people, show some respect.",
          "If you\u2019re in Berlin this memorial is a must visit. This was one of the most touching & learning experiences of our travels. The self-guided headsets are a perfect opportunity to get lost in the information of what these people & families went through. The memorial is done so",
          "One has to see and walk through this memorial to appreciate and gain and understanding of what it represents. Its impact is especially felt walking through the maze of stones and gaining an understanding of what those impacted felt. It is definitively worth time to see.",
          "Inordinate idea of artists makes feel lost, very interesting solution of monument devoted to human tragedy",
          "This is an amazing tribute to the millions of Jews and others destroyed during WWII. Takes and needs time for quiet individual reflection",
          "I can strongly recommend this place. When you walk into it you can really feel that you are stuck in a prison. Its easy to get lost and loose your friend.",
          "This is definitely worth a visit, particularly as it\u2019s only 100 yds from the Brandenburg Gate. It\u2019s made up of different sized blocks of concrete situated on a wavering floor. So you can walk in between some of the blocks and they are towering above you.",
          "As part of our historic walking tour of Berlin we spent some time at the Holocaust Memorial. This is a must see I think. It has been laid out in a very interesting manner that invites discussion.",
          "Such a perfect memorial for such a horrific time in recent history, it makes you feel oppressed and lost wandering among the huge grey blocks. The size of it is quite astonishing and it\u2019s very hard to realise just how enormous it is as you approach it. A place that should be",
          "Walking through the cement pillars is a feeling you experience. I tried to ignore those taking selfies or posing.",
          "This memorial is beautiful. In the middle of the bustling city it is quiet and peaceful. You can interpret so many meanings from what is here.",
          "When you're in Berlin, you have to visit the monument and especially the museum underneath it! And take a audio tour, really impressive and makes you think!",
          "If you go to Berlin go here. This is a very special space and you should ensure you take the time to spend enough time here. One request please respect the memorial, it\u2019s was disrespectful to see the number of people taking selfies and sitting on the memorial",
          "This is an amazing memorial and a must see if you visit Berlin. Don't just drive by. To really appreciate it you need to allow 10 to 15 minutes to walk through it from one corner to the other and experience the vast number of pillars of all shapes and sizes. The sculptor does",
          "On the one hand, it's very dramatic that they have built this monument. On the other hand, we wanted to go downstairs to view the Museum part of the monument and, because my partner is a photographer who needs his black and white high speed film hand-checked, they refused to do",
          "This memorial is both chilling and respectful but at the same time eerie and dark. From the moment you see the blocks to the time You step deep inside (yes) the further you go the deeper you get. You see passing strangers there one moment then gone the next. Children playing",
          "Such a well designed memorial. Loved walking through and reflecting. There were so many people, but still serene.",
          "What a great tribute to the murdered Jews and well done Germany and Berlin for this excellent site and wonderful museum (underneath the blocks) in the heart of the Capital City",
          "It was fascinating to see all these granite(?) blocks laid out over a huge area representing the thousands of Jews killed in the Holocaust but why there? and why? Do the german population understand the memorial, I'm not sure I did.",
          "We experienced this beautiful memorial during our visit . We also spent a few hours in the museum down stairs . So well put together . The German community have to be congratulated on how they are supporting this and the many events that can\u2019t and wont be pushed aside .",
          "This is an array of some 2700 blocks commemorating those who lost their lives-Jews, gentiles, govt people, police, etc. you interpret the blocks as you walk amongst them and memorialize the deceased as you wish.",
          "The artist built all different squares and rectangle blocks to \"confuse and daze\" you (as were the Jews on their way to Concentration Camps). It is quite large...well worth the stop to walk around",
          "We visited in autumn so the stark grey concrete blocks were framed by the back drop of beautiful autumnal trees This is a lovely place to wander and gather thoughts and To muse on the atrocities. I would recommend people visit",
          "A special monument with different sized cubes. Centrally located in Berlin, close to Brandenburger Tor.",
          "Heavy. This is one of those things that should be done with respect and humility. It's very interesting the design the setting, the location. I saw some people with selfie sticks, sitting on the blocks, or laughing. Come on, show more class than that. It's a very chilling",
          "Such a horrific event should never have taken place. Despite its occurrence we were lucky enough to have experienced such a tasteful monument to those lives lost",
          "Very honest and eye-opening experience to go to see this memorial with the exhibition underground - so many things to learn and its all very well presented - definitely recommend.",
          "The memorial is perfect. It gives you the idea of being closed in, and hits you in the right spot, IF you have ever been educated on the matter. Sadly, half of the people visiting, are missing the point of the memorial and only think about instagram.",
          "Well worth visiting / be sure to go underground and get the audio tour / one of the best attractions in Berlin - very informative and nicely done",
          "The sculptor has deliberately not given an explanation of what he had in mind with this memorial. He has left it up to each individual to ponder on its meaning. Its simple design lends itself to a myriad of interpretations, It was very disappointing to see some people taking",
          "as you approach, this memorial just looks like a series of concrete blocks set out in a park. But the trick is to walk along the many paths between the blocks. You quickly get a sense of being trapped in a maze or tomb, with just glimpses of others wandering their own path.",
          "What does it mean? Up to you. But it certainly makes a statement. The cement blocks can mean much to many.",
          "We went because it was there .... but it was so much more. You just have to go ..... so go The museum compliments the memorial so beautifully",
          "I stopped here during a bike tour of the city but then went back on my own to visit the museum below the monument. It's situated less than a 5 minute walk from the Brandenburg gate. I arrived there just before the doors opened and there were about 20 people in front of me",
          "After our visit to the Reichstag we wandered by this memorial. Amazing place with all the concrete blocks. Whilst we didn't go into the museum the place was very moving - imagining what this was commemorating. Definitely well worth a visit.",
          "Just a bunch of gray concrete slabs, all differing in size and height, but the significance of this memorial is huge. Each of these slabs represents thousands of Jews who were murdered during the Holocaust. Walking between these slabs brings home the massive genocide that",
          "My mum and I visited whilst staying in Berlin and what an important experience. The actual memorial above ground is moving in itself - expansive, immersive and thought provoking. However the museum underneath is well worth a visit and whilst particularly harrowing it details",
          "In my opinion, this memorial is very impressive. When you walk there among all these (more than 2700 of them) stones (concrete slabs) you cannot avoid thinking about the Holocaust and all those millions of Jews killed by the Nazis. Very respectful.",
          "Very impressive description of the horrible things that happened there. Great way of sharing it in a very simple tribute to those that died there.",
          "I had never heard of this memorial, until I came across it during a tour in Berlin. I was so taken with it, that I walked over there after the bus tour was over. It is big, beautiful, compelling, and photogenic. You could get lost in your thoughts walking amongst the columns.",
          "Can not say enough on how moving it was. going through the memorial was jaw dropping when you try to think about why the memorial was made the way it was",
          "Paying respects to the many dead. What can you say? Truely moving experience. It is quite a large space. Please be respectful when you visit",
          "After walking through the concrete sculptures adventure down underground to the museum which is free of charge where you will find personal accounts and stories of families separated through series if events with regards to the evacuation of Jewish people from all over Europe to"

        "wiki": "The Schlossberg (English: Castle Hill), at 473 meters (or 1552 feet) above sea level, is a tree-clad hill, and the site of a fortress, in the centre of the city of Graz, Austria. The hill is now a public park and enjoys extensive views of the city. It is the site of several entertainment venues, caf\u00e9s and restaurants, and is managed by Holding Graz, the city owned utility company.The fortification of the Schlossberg goes back to at least the 10th century. In the mid-16th century, a 400 m (1,300 ft) long fortress was constructed by architects from the north of Italy. There are records of a cable-hauled lift being in use between 1528 and 1595 to move construction materials for the fortifications. The castle was never conquered, but it was largely demolished by Napoleonic forces under the Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn of 1809. The clock tower (the Uhrturm) and bell tower (the Glockenturm) were spared after the people of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation.The remains of the castle were turned into a public park by Ludwig von Welden in 1839. The park contains the Uhrturm, the Glockenturm, a cistern (the T\u00fcrkenbrunnen) and two bastions from the old castle. The Uhrturm is a recognisable icon for the city, and is unusual in that the clock's hands have opposite roles to the common notion, with the larger one marking hours while the smaller is for minutes. The Glockenturm contains Liesl, the heaviest bell in Graz.Near the Uhrturm there is a caf\u00e9 with views over the old town. Additionally, on the western side of the Schlossberg, there are two small caf\u00e9s, one with table service and the other one with self-service. Next to the terminus of the funicular railway there is a hilltop restaurant with views of western Graz. In what was once the cellar of one of the ruined bastions is the Kasemattenb\u00fchne, an open-air stage for concerts and performances.Below the Schlossberg hill is an extensive system of tunnels, which were created during the second world war to protect the civilian population of Graz from aerial bombing. Some of these tunnels are still accessible, including a passage from Schlossbergplatz to Karmeliterplatz, and Fairytale Express Graz, a grotto railway for children. Also in the tunnel complex is the Dom im Berg, which was expanded in 2000 to provide a venue space for up to 600 people.The summit of the hill is linked to the city centre by various steep paths and staircases, and by the Schlossbergbahn, a funicular railway. Additionally the recent Schlossberg lift links the summit to the tunnel system and, via that, to Schlossbergplatz.Each year the Elevate Festival, a festival for contemporary music, art and political discourse, is held in various venues in and around the Schlossberg.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Schlo\u00dfberg, Graz at Wikimedia Commons\nSchlossberg page on Graz Tourism web site\nSchlossberg page on Holding Graz web site",

          "I visited the Scholossberg with the guided tour, that you can book in the Tourism center near the main square. We got up there with the cable car. The guide was nice and had a good knowledge of the history of the place. You can have a nice view from the city up there.",

          "The fortress has been preserved and has a beautiful view of Graz and the environment. There are two ways to take it on the fortress. The first foot steps, very hard and the other elevator. Coming down the stairs, you can use but we recommend the descent by funicular.",
          "The climb up here is brutal. I do believe they have cable cars that will take you up and down the hill which are highly recommended if you're travelling with seniors or kids, or if you don't want to sweat a lot. Like most places in Austria though, this place could do with some",
          "A nice place to go. Gives you a high viewpoint over the city....You can climb up the side via stairs, or if you rather not, there is a elevator inside that takes you most of the way up (or down). I'd recommend you take it up and walk down the stairs. There's also a restaurant at",

          "This once mighty fortress, high on a hill, is now a beautiful park offering nice walks and great views of Graz, including the Mur river and the impressive Kunsthaus Graz. You can also check out some of the historic sights that still remain such as the Uhrturm (Clock Tower), an",
          "Seriously one of the better city parks. Endless trails. Lots of great views over Graz. Once you are away from the touristy part, there is literally no one. The clock tower is nice. Plenty to do. Can easily spend the better part of a day here.",

          "Well worth a visit. Great view overlooking the city, popular place for tourists but dosnt get crowded. Not an awful lot to do once you are at the top, but some nice statues, history and cafes. Nice photo opportunities. Probably the main part of Graz city for us.",

          "This is a nice park to go around but I really do not saw anything really special. The weather was not so good and I was during the week, so the park was a little empty. There are a few fountains and some constructions, but anything that I can remember to mention here.",
          "Very interesting gardens on several levels, well signed with information about the (considerable) history of the schlossberg. Some very decent plantings. Keep an eye open for the tiny lizards basking in the sun.",

You can either take the elevator in the centre of town (1 euro) or take a t\u00e9l\u00e9f\u00e9rique. You can also walk back on foot to the centre of town, which gives you spectacular views",
          "This is a very nice park that is elevated up above the city on the Schlo\u00dfberg. The views are incredible and it is not as crowded so also nice to get out the bustling city. Just a bit up from the Uhrturm so nice to de at the same time.",

          "Please don't be disappointed, the fountain does not work at the moment because of refurbishment. The park is beautiful with all the old trees and bushes and flowers. In case the \"Schlossberg\" has been described there is no fountain like the picture shows. I know this because I",

          "Very nice place. Go by foot. Also, you can buy a combined ticket for lift and venicular (best used in that order - lift up, venicular down).",
          "Take your time to go up by foot!!! It would be a little bit hard but with every step up can discover fantastic views of city roofs! Magic!",
          "It's a very clean and neat park, located at the city center on the ruins of an old fortress. It's worth the effort, specially due to the great view of the city of Graz. Be prepared for long walks!",
          "For the very fit, you can walk up to the Schlossberg, but there is a venicular, which is included in a travel ticket, which is much easier! Beautiful views of Graz from the Schlossberg and well worth the visit.",
          "It is good to have a park in the middle of the town.You can go up to the Schlossberg on foot, by a lift or by a cable railway",
          "I spent 3 days in Graz, and I can say that these park is by far the main attraction of the city (together with the Old City). The park is located on a hill overlooking the whole city; you can reach it both by elevator and by funicular, but if you are quite fit, I warmly suggest",
          "When in Graz, don't miss the chance to visit this delightful park, placed in the vey city center! You can have a long walk along the hills in which it is located, and you can reach the top of the park enjoying the very best view of Graz and the clock tower, both during the day",
          "You can walk up (long and steep), take the lift (doesn`t go right to the top...) or take the funicular railway (Schlossbergbahn) which goes virtually to the top. I prefer the funicular as you get a changing view as it goes up the steep hill in the middle of Graz. There are",
          "The gardens are beautiful and the total panoramic view of the entire city of Graz is well worth climbing the 260 steps!",

          "Beautiful old and old-style city park. Very green in summer, very well kept, different moods for every season. Quite a few exotic trees and bushes, many of them labelled. Lots of benches, recreational activities, people passing through or playing or lounging. The city's back",

          "The public transport was unavailable on that particular day I was there, so I had to climb all the way up the hill through the stairs. Besides, it was raining in earnest. But I enjoyed the walk and the impressive view of Altstadt (Old Town) nonetheless.",
          "Well worth the visit, amazing views and some lovely cafe's and restaurants. The funicular is worth taking for the return leg, particularly if you survived the 260 steps to get to the top.",

          "This place is very nice to sit after having lunch. discovering the old castle paths looks great. The park contains great places for sightseeing. You will get flower garden, see the city from the top and you see old canons too!",
          "If you want some amazing views of Graz, climbing the Schlossberg is definitely the way to go. It's really beautiful up there, and you can either spend just a little while walking through or go up there with a picnic and make an evening of it. We went at sunset, and the view of",

        "wiki": "Graz ( GRAHTS, German: [\u0261\u0281a\u02d0ts] (listen); Slovene: Gradec) is the capital city of Styria and Austria's second-largest city after Vienna. As of 1 January 2019, Graz had a population of 328,276 (292,269 of whom had principal-residence status). In 2015, the population of the Graz larger urban zone (LUZ) stood at 633,168, based on principal-residence status. Graz has a long tradition as a seat of higher education. It has four colleges and four universities with more than 60,000 students. Its historic centre  (Altstadt) is one of the best-preserved city centres in Central Europe.For centuries, Graz was more important to Slovenes and Croats, both politically and culturally, than the capitals of Ljubljana, Slovenia and Zagreb, Croatia; it remains influential to this day. In 1999, the city's historic centre was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites and in 2010 the designation was expanded to include Eggenberg Palace (German: Schloss Eggenberg) on the western edge of the city. Graz was designated the Cultural Capital of Europe in 2003 and became a City of Culinary Delights in 2008.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name of the city, Graz, formerly spelled Gratz, most likely stems from the Slavic gradec, which means \"small castle\". Some archaeological finds point to the erection of a small castle by Alpine Slavic people, which over time became a heavily defended fortification. In literary Slovene and Croatian, gradec still means \"small castle\", forming a hypocoristic derivative of Proto-West-South Slavic *grad\u044cc\u044a, whichs descends via liquid metathesis from Common Slavic *gard\u044cc\u044a and via the Slavic third palatalisation from Proto-Slavic *gardiku, originally denoting \"small town, settlement\". The name thus follows the common South Slavic pattern for naming settlements as grad. The German name 'Graz' first appears in records in 1128.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGraz is situated on both sides of the Mur river in southeast Austria. It is about 200 km (120 mi) southwest of Vienna (Wien). The nearest larger urban centre is Maribor (Marburg) in Slovenia, which is about 50 km (31 mi) to the south. Graz is the state capital and largest city in Styria, a green and heavily forested region on the eastern edge of the Alps.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring municipalities ===\nThese towns and villages border Graz:\n\nto the north: Gratkorn, Stattegg, Weinitzen\nto the east: Kainbach bei Graz, Hart bei Graz, Raaba\nto the south: G\u00f6ssendorf, Feldkirchen bei Graz, Seiersberg\nto the west: Attendorf, Thal, Judendorf-Stra\u00dfengel\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nGraz is divided into 17 municipal districts (Stadtbezirke):\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement on the ground of the modern city of Graz dates back to the Copper Age. However, no historical continuity exists of a settlement before the Middle Ages.\nDuring the 12th century, dukes under Babenberg rule made the town into an important commercial center. Later, Graz came under the rule of the Habsburgs and, in 1281, gained special privileges from King Rudolph I.\nIn the 14th century, Graz became the city of residence of the Inner Austrian line of the Habsburgs. The royalty lived in the Schlossberg castle and from there ruled Styria, Carinthia, most of today's Slovenia, and parts of Italy (Carniola, Gorizia and Gradisca, Trieste).\nIn the 16th century, the city's design and planning were primarily controlled by Italian Renaissance architects and artists. One of the most famous buildings representative of this style is the Landhaus, designed by Domenico dell'Allio, and used by the local rulers as a governmental headquarters.\n\nThe University of Graz was founded by Archduke Karl II in 1585, it's the city's oldest university. For most of its existence, it was controlled by the Catholic church, and was closed in 1782 by Joseph II in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a lyceum where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-established as a university by Emperor Franz I, and was named 'Karl-Franzens Universit\u00e4t' or 'Charles-Francis University' in English. More than 30,000 students are currently enrolled at this university.\nThe astronomer Johannes Kepler lived in Graz for a short period. He worked as a math teacher and was a professor of mathematics at the University of Graz, but still found time to study astronomy. He left Graz for Prague when Lutherans were banned from the city.\nLudwig Boltzmann was Professor for Mathematical Physics from 1869 to 1890. During that time, Nikola Tesla studied electrical engineering at the Polytechnic in 1875. Nobel Laureate Otto Loewi taught at the University of Graz from 1909 until 1938. Ivo Andric, the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature Laureate obtained his doctorate at the University of Graz. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger was briefly chancellor of the University of Graz in 1936.\nGraz is centrally located within today's Bundesland (state) of Styria, or Steiermark in German. Mark is an old German word indicating a large area of land used as a defensive border, in which the peasantry is taught how to organize and fight in the case of an invasion. With a strategic location at the head of the open and fertile Mur valley, Graz was historically a target of invaders, such as the Hungarians under Matthias Corvinus in 1481, and the Ottoman Turks in 1529 and 1532. Apart from the Riegersburg Castle, the Schlossberg was the only fortification in the region that never fell to the Ottoman Turks. Graz is home to the region's provincial armory, which is the world's largest historical collection of late medieval and Renaissance weaponry. It has been preserved since 1551, and displays over 30,000 items.\nFrom the earlier part of the 15th century, Graz was the residence of the younger branch of the Habsburgs, which succeeded to the imperial throne in 1619 in the person of Emperor Ferdinand II, who moved the capital to Vienna. New fortifications were built on the Schlossberg at the end of the 16th century. Napoleon's army occupied Graz in 1797. In 1809, the city withstood another assault by the French army. During this attack, the commanding officer in the fortress was ordered to defend it with about 900 men against Napoleon's army of about 3,000. He successfully defended the Schlossberg against eight attacks, but they were forced to give up after the Grande Arm\u00e9e occupied Vienna and the Emperor ordered to surrender. Following the defeat of Austria by Napoleonic forces at the Battle of Wagram in 1809, the fortifications were demolished using explosives, as stipulated in the Peace of Sch\u00f6nbrunn of the same year. The belltower (Glockenturm) and the civic clock tower (Uhrturm), which is a leading tourist attraction and serves as a symbol for Graz, were spared after the citizens of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation.Archduke Karl II of Inner Austria had 20,000 Protestant books burned in the square of what is now a mental hospital, and succeeded in returning Styria to the authority of the Holy See. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was born in Graz in what is now the Stadtmuseum (city museum).\n\n\n== Population development ==\nThe more recent population figures do not give the whole picture as only people with principal-residence status are counted and people with secondary residence status are not. Most of the people with secondary residence status in Graz are students. At the end of 2016 there were 33,473 people with secondary residence status in Graz.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nOceanic climate is the type found in the city, but due to the 0 \u00b0C isotherm, the same occurs in a humid continental climate with based in K\u00f6ppen system (Cfb/Dfb borderline). Wladimir K\u00f6ppen himself was in town and conducted studies to see how the climate of the past influenced the Continental Drift theory. Due to its position southeast of the Alps, Graz is shielded from the prevailing westerly winds that bring weather fronts in from the North Atlantic to northwestern and central Europe. The weather in Graz is thus influenced by the Mediterranean, and it has more hours of sunshine per year than Vienna or Salzburg and also less wind or rain. Graz lies in a basin that is only open to the south, causing the climate to be warmer than would be expected at that latitude. Plants are found in Graz that normally grow much further south.\n\naverage temperatures: Graz Airport 8.7 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) / Karl-Franzens University 9.4 \u00b0C (49 \u00b0F)\naverage rainfall: 818 mm (32 in) with on average 92 days of rain (Karl Franzens University)\naverage hours of sunshine: 1,989 (Karl Franzens University)\n\n\n== Slovenes and Graz ==\nPolitically, culturally, scientifically and religiously, Graz was an important centre for all Slovenes, especially from the establishment of the University of Graz in 1586 until the establishment of University of Ljubljana in 1919. In 1574, the first Slovene Catholic book was published in Graz, and in 1592, Hieronymus Megiser published in Graz the book Dictionarium quatuor linguarum, the first multilingual dictionary of Slovene.The Styrian Slovenes did not consider Graz a German-speaking city, but their own, a place to study while living at their relatives' homes and to fulfill one's career ambitions. The student associations in Graz were a crucible of the Slovene identity, and the Slovene students in Graz were more nationally aware than some others. This led to fierce anti-Slovene efforts of German-speaking nationalists in Graz before and during World War II.Many Slovenian Styrians study there. Slovenes are among the professors at the Institute for Jazz in Graz. Numerous Slovenes have found employment there, while being formerly unemployed in Slovenia. For the Slovene culture, Graz remains permanently important due to its university and the Universalmuseum Joanneum archives containing numerous documents from the Slovenian Styria.A symposium on the relation of Graz and the Slovenes was held in Graz in 2010, at the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the first and oldest chair of Slovene. It was established at the Lyzeum of Graz in July 1811 on the initiative of Janez Nepomuk Primic. A collection of lectures on the topic was published. The Slovenian Post commemorated the anniversary with a stamp.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nFor the year that Graz was Cultural Capital of Europe, new structures were erected. The Graz Museum of Contemporary Art (German: Kunsthaus) was designed by Peter Cook and Colin Fournier and is situated next to the Mur river. The Island in the Mur is a floating platform made of steel. It was designed by American architect Vito Acconci and contains a caf\u00e9, an open-air theatre and a playground.\n\n\n=== Historic city centre ===\n\nThe historic centre was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999 due to the harmonious co-existence of typical buildings from different epochs and in different architectural styles. Situated in a cultural borderland between Central Europe, Italy and the Balkan States, Graz absorbed various influences from the neighbouring regions and thus received its exceptional townscape. Today the historic centre consists of over 1,000 buildings, their age ranging from Gothic to contemporary.\nThe most important sights in the historic centre are:\n\nTown Hall (Rathaus).\nThe Castle hill (German: Schlossberg), a hill dominating the historic centre (475 m (1,558.40 ft) high), site of a demolished fortress, with views over Graz.\nThe Clock Tower (Uhrturm) is a symbol of Graz, at the top of the Castle hill.\nThe New Gallery (Neue Galerie), a museum of art.\nThe Castle hill funicular (Schlossbergbahn), a funicular railway on the Castle hill's slope.\nThe seat of Styria's provincial parliament (Landhaus), a palace in Lombardic style.

It includes both the grave where Ferdinand II and his wife are buried, and a church dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria.\nThe Castle (Burg), with Gothic double staircase, built between 1438 and 1453 by Emperor Frederick III, because the old castle on the Schlossberg hill was too small and uncomfortable.

Events have been held at different venues in Graz and in the surrounding region.\n\n\n=== Dialect ===\nReferred to as Steirisch by locals, Graz belongs to the Austro-Bavarian region of dialects, more specifically a mix of Central Bavarian in the western part of Styria and Southern Bavarian in the eastern part. The Grazer ORF, the Graz subsidiary of Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, launched an initiative in 2008 called Scho wieda Steirisch g'redt in order to highlight the numerous dialects of Graz and Styria in general and to cultivate the pride many Styrians hold for their local culture. Two reasons for a melding of these dialects with Standard German: the influence of television and radio bringing Standard German into the home and the industrialization causing the disappearance of the single farmer since the farming communities are seen as the true keepers of dialect speaking.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nAn extensive public transport network makes Graz an easy city to navigate without a car. The city has a comprehensive bus network, complementing the Graz tram network consisting of eight lines. Four lines pass through the underground tram stop at the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof) and on to the city centre before branching out. Furthermore, there are seven night-time bus routes, although these run only at weekends and on evenings preceding public holidays.\nThe Schlossbergbahn, a funicular railway, and the Schlossberg lift, a vertical lift, link the city centre to the Schlossberg.\nFrom the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), regional trains link to most of Styria. Direct trains run to most major cities nearby including Vienna, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Maribor and Ljubljana in Slovenia, Zagreb in Croatia, Budapest in Hungary, Prague and Brno in the Czech Republic, Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland, as well as Munich, Stuttgart, Heidelberg, and Frankfurt in Germany. Trains for Vienna leave every hour. In recent years many railway stations within the city limits and in the suburbs have been rebuilt or modernised and are now part of the \"S-Bahn Graz\", a commuter train service connecting the city with its suburban area and towns nearby.\nGraz airport is located about 10 km (6 mi) south of the city centre and is accessible by bus, railway, and car. Direct destinations include Amsterdam, Berlin, D\u00fcsseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart, Istanbul, Vienna and Zurich.\n\n\n== Health ==\nIn Graz there are seven hospitals, several private hospitals and sanatoriums, as well as 44 pharmacies.\nThe University Hospital Graz (LKH-Universit\u00e4ts-Klinikum Graz) is located in eastern Graz and has 1,556 beds and 7,190 employees. The Regional Hospital Graz II (LKH Graz II) has two sites in Graz. The western site (LKH Graz II Standort West) is located in Eggenberg and has 280 beds and about 500 employees, the southern site (LKH Graz II Standort S\u00fcd) specializes in neurology and psychiatry and is located in Stra\u00dfgang with 880 beds and 1,100 employees.

Furthermore, several non-emergency ambulances (KTW \u2013 Krankentransportwagen) and a Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) are operated by the Red Cross to transport non-emergency patients to and between hospitals. In addition to the Red Cross, the Labourers'-Samaritan-Alliance (Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund \u00d6sterreichs), the Austrian organisation of the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps (Malteser Hospitaldienst Austria) and the Green Cross (Gr\u00fcnes Kreuz) operate ambulances (KTW) for non-emergency patient transport. In addition to the cars, there's also the C12 air ambulance helicopter stationed at Graz airport, staffed with an emergency physician in addition to regular personnel.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nGraz is twinned with:\n\nOther forms of cooperation and city friendship similar to the twin city programmes\n Ni\u0161, Serbia\n Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nThe following are past and present notable residents of Graz.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Austria portal\nList of World Heritage Sites in Austria\nKastner & \u00d6hler\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"Graz: Stadtplanung und Stadtentwicklung (Rechnungshofbericht, 2006) in German\" (PDF). 2006.

Its historic centre  (Altstadt) is one of the best-preserved city centres in Central Europe.For centuries, Graz was more important to Slovenes and Croats, both politically and culturally, than the capitals of Ljubljana, Slovenia and Zagreb, Croatia; it remains influential to this day. In 1999, the city's historic centre was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites and in 2010 the designation was expanded to include Eggenberg Palace (German: Schloss Eggenberg) on the western edge of the city. Graz was designated the Cultural Capital of Europe in 2003 and became a City of Culinary Delights in 2008.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name of the city, Graz, formerly spelled Gratz, most likely stems from the Slavic gradec, which means \"small castle\". Some archaeological finds point to the erection of a small castle by Alpine Slavic people, which over time became a heavily defended fortification. In literary Slovene and Croatian, gradec still means \"small castle\", forming a hypocoristic derivative of Proto-West-South Slavic *grad\u044cc\u044a, whichs descends via liquid metathesis from Common Slavic *gard\u044cc\u044a and via the Slavic third palatalisation from Proto-Slavic *gardiku, originally denoting \"small town, settlement\". The name thus follows the common South Slavic pattern for naming settlements as grad. The German name 'Graz' first appears in records in 1128.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGraz is situated on both sides of the Mur river in southeast Austria. It is about 200 km (120 mi) southwest of Vienna (Wien). The nearest larger urban centre is Maribor (Marburg) in Slovenia, which is about 50 km (31 mi) to the south. Graz is the state capital and largest city in Styria, a green and heavily forested region on the eastern edge of the Alps.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring municipalities ===\nThese towns and villages border Graz:\n\nto the north: Gratkorn, Stattegg, Weinitzen\nto the east: Kainbach bei Graz, Hart bei Graz, Raaba\nto the south: G\u00f6ssendorf, Feldkirchen bei Graz, Seiersberg\nto the west: Attendorf, Thal, Judendorf-Stra\u00dfengel\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nGraz is divided into 17 municipal districts (Stadtbezirke):\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement on the ground of the modern city of Graz dates back to the Copper Age. However, no historical continuity exists of a settlement before the Middle Ages.\nDuring the 12th century, dukes under Babenberg rule made the town into an important commercial center. Later, Graz came under the rule of the Habsburgs and, in 1281, gained special privileges from King Rudolph I.\nIn the 14th century, Graz became the city of residence of the Inner Austrian line of the Habsburgs. The royalty lived in the Schlossberg castle and from there ruled Styria, Carinthia, most of today's Slovenia, and parts of Italy (Carniola, Gorizia and Gradisca, Trieste).\nIn the 16th century, the city's design and planning were primarily controlled by Italian Renaissance architects and artists. One of the most famous buildings representative of this style is the Landhaus, designed by Domenico dell'Allio, and used by the local rulers as a governmental headquarters.\n\nThe University of Graz was founded by Archduke Karl II in 1585, it's the city's oldest university. For most of its existence, it was controlled by the Catholic church, and was closed in 1782 by Joseph II in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a lyceum where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-established as a university by Emperor Franz I, and was named 'Karl-Franzens Universit\u00e4t' or 'Charles-Francis University' in English. More than 30,000 students are currently enrolled at this university.\nThe astronomer Johannes Kepler lived in Graz for a short period. He worked as a math teacher and was a professor of mathematics at the University of Graz, but still found time to study astronomy. He left Graz for Prague when Lutherans were banned from the city.\nLudwig Boltzmann was Professor for Mathematical Physics from 1869 to 1890. During that time, Nikola Tesla studied electrical engineering at the Polytechnic in 1875. Nobel Laureate Otto Loewi taught at the University of Graz from 1909 until 1938. Ivo Andric, the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature Laureate obtained his doctorate at the University of Graz. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger was briefly chancellor of the University of Graz in 1936.\nGraz is centrally located within today's Bundesland (state) of Styria, or Steiermark in German. Mark is an old German word indicating a large area of land used as a defensive border, in which the peasantry is taught how to organize and fight in the case of an invasion. With a strategic location at the head of the open and fertile Mur valley, Graz was historically a target of invaders, such as the Hungarians under Matthias Corvinus in 1481, and the Ottoman Turks in 1529 and 1532. Apart from the Riegersburg Castle, the Schlossberg was the only fortification in the region that never fell to the Ottoman Turks. Graz is home to the region's provincial armory, which is the world's largest historical collection of late medieval and Renaissance weaponry. It has been preserved since 1551, and displays over 30,000 items.\nFrom the earlier part of the 15th century, Graz was the residence of the younger branch of the Habsburgs, which succeeded to the imperial throne in 1619 in the person of Emperor Ferdinand II, who moved the capital to Vienna. New fortifications were built on the Schlossberg at the end of the 16th century. Napoleon's army occupied Graz in 1797. In 1809, the city withstood another assault by the French army. During this attack, the commanding officer in the fortress was ordered to defend it with about 900 men against Napoleon's army of about 3,000. He successfully defended the Schlossberg against eight attacks, but they were forced to give up after the Grande Arm\u00e9e occupied Vienna and the Emperor ordered to surrender. Following the defeat of Austria by Napoleonic forces at the Battle of Wagram in 1809, the fortifications were demolished using explosives, as stipulated in the Peace of Sch\u00f6nbrunn of the same year. The belltower (Glockenturm) and the civic clock tower (Uhrturm), which is a leading tourist attraction and serves as a symbol for Graz, were spared after the citizens of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation.Archduke Karl II of Inner Austria had 20,000 Protestant books burned in the square of what is now a mental hospital, and succeeded in returning Styria to the authority of the Holy See. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was born in Graz in what is now the Stadtmuseum (city museum).\n\n\n== Population development ==\nThe more recent population figures do not give the whole picture as only people with principal-residence status are counted and people with secondary residence status are not. Most of the people with secondary residence status in Graz are students. At the end of 2016 there were 33,473 people with secondary residence status in Graz.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nOceanic climate is the type found in the city, but due to the 0 \u00b0C isotherm, the same occurs in a humid continental climate with based in K\u00f6ppen system (Cfb/Dfb borderline). Wladimir K\u00f6ppen himself was in town and conducted studies to see how the climate of the past influenced the Continental Drift theory. Due to its position southeast of the Alps, Graz is shielded from the prevailing westerly winds that bring weather fronts in from the North Atlantic to northwestern and central Europe. The weather in Graz is thus influenced by the Mediterranean, and it has more hours of sunshine per year than Vienna or Salzburg and also less wind or rain. Graz lies in a basin that is only open to the south, causing the climate to be warmer than would be expected at that latitude. Plants are found in Graz that normally grow much further south.\n\naverage temperatures: Graz Airport 8.7 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) / Karl-Franzens University 9.4 \u00b0C (49 \u00b0F)\naverage rainfall: 818 mm (32 in) with on average 92 days of rain (Karl Franzens University)\naverage hours of sunshine: 1,989 (Karl Franzens University)\n\n\n== Slovenes and Graz ==\nPolitically, culturally, scientifically and religiously, Graz was an important centre for all Slovenes, especially from the establishment of the University of Graz in 1586 until the establishment of University of Ljubljana in 1919. In 1574, the first Slovene Catholic book was published in Graz, and in 1592, Hieronymus Megiser published in Graz the book Dictionarium quatuor linguarum, the first multilingual dictionary of Slovene.The Styrian Slovenes did not consider Graz a German-speaking city, but their own, a place to study while living at their relatives' homes and to fulfill one's career ambitions. The student associations in Graz were a crucible of the Slovene identity, and the Slovene students in Graz were more nationally aware than some others. This led to fierce anti-Slovene efforts of German-speaking nationalists in Graz before and during World War II.Many Slovenian Styrians study there. Slovenes are among the professors at the Institute for Jazz in Graz. Numerous Slovenes have found employment there, while being formerly unemployed in Slovenia. For the Slovene culture, Graz remains permanently important due to its university and the Universalmuseum Joanneum archives containing numerous documents from the Slovenian Styria.A symposium on the relation of Graz and the Slovenes was held in Graz in 2010, at the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the first and oldest chair of Slovene. It was established at the Lyzeum of Graz in July 1811 on the initiative of Janez Nepomuk Primic. A collection of lectures on the topic was published. The Slovenian Post commemorated the anniversary with a stamp.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nFor the year that Graz was Cultural Capital of Europe, new structures were erected. The Graz Museum of Contemporary Art (German: Kunsthaus) was designed by Peter Cook and Colin Fournier and is situated next to the Mur river. The Island in the Mur is a floating platform made of steel. It was designed by American architect Vito Acconci and contains a caf\u00e9, an open-air theatre and a playground.\n\n\n=== Historic city centre ===\n\nThe historic centre was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999 due to the harmonious co-existence of typical buildings from different epochs and in different architectural styles. Situated in a cultural borderland between Central Europe, Italy and the Balkan States, Graz absorbed various influences from the neighbouring regions and thus received its exceptional townscape. Today the historic centre consists of over 1,000 buildings, their age ranging from Gothic to contemporary.\nThe most important sights in the historic centre are:\n\nTown Hall (Rathaus).\nThe Castle hill (German: Schlossberg), a hill dominating the historic centre (475 m (1,558.40 ft) high), site of a demolished fortress, with views over Graz.\nThe Clock Tower (Uhrturm) is a symbol of Graz, at the top of the Castle hill.\nThe New Gallery (Neue Galerie), a museum of art.\nThe Castle hill funicular (Schlossbergbahn), a funicular railway on the Castle hill's slope.\nThe seat of Styria's provincial parliament (Landhaus), a palace in Lombardic style.

It features the oldest painted view of Graz.\nThe mausoleum of Emperor Ferdinand II next to the cathedral, the most important building of Mannerism in Graz. It includes both the grave where Ferdinand II and his wife are buried, and a church dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria.\nThe Castle (Burg), with Gothic double staircase, built between 1438 and 1453 by Emperor Frederick III, because the old castle on the Schlossberg hill was too small and uncomfortable.

In the outer districts buildings are predominantly of the architectural styles from the second half of the 20th century.\nIn 1965 the Grazer Schule (School of Graz) was founded. Several buildings around the universities are of this style, for example the green houses by Volker Giencke and the RESOWI center by G\u00fcnther Domenig.\nBefore Graz became the European Capital of Culture in 2003, several new projects were realized, such as the Stadthalle, the Kindermuseum (museum for children), the Helmut-List-Halle, the Kunsthaus and the Murinsel.\n\nTallest buildings\nBuildings in Graz which are at least 50m tall: \n\n\n=== Sports ===\nSK Sturm Graz is the main football club of the city, with three Austrian championships and five runner-up seasons.

Events have been held at different venues in Graz and in the surrounding region.\n\n\n=== Dialect ===\nReferred to as Steirisch by locals, Graz belongs to the Austro-Bavarian region of dialects, more specifically a mix of Central Bavarian in the western part of Styria and Southern Bavarian in the eastern part. The Grazer ORF, the Graz subsidiary of Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, launched an initiative in 2008 called Scho wieda Steirisch g'redt in order to highlight the numerous dialects of Graz and Styria in general and to cultivate the pride many Styrians hold for their local culture. Two reasons for a melding of these dialects with Standard German: the influence of television and radio bringing Standard German into the home and the industrialization causing the disappearance of the single farmer since the farming communities are seen as the true keepers of dialect speaking.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nAn extensive public transport network makes Graz an easy city to navigate without a car. The city has a comprehensive bus network, complementing the Graz tram network consisting of eight lines. Four lines pass through the underground tram stop at the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof) and on to the city centre before branching out. Furthermore, there are seven night-time bus routes, although these run only at weekends and on evenings preceding public holidays.\nThe Schlossbergbahn, a funicular railway, and the Schlossberg lift, a vertical lift, link the city centre to the Schlossberg.\nFrom the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), regional trains link to most of Styria. Direct trains run to most major cities nearby including Vienna, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Maribor and Ljubljana in Slovenia, Zagreb in Croatia, Budapest in Hungary, Prague and Brno in the Czech Republic, Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland, as well as Munich, Stuttgart, Heidelberg, and Frankfurt in Germany. Trains for Vienna leave every hour. In recent years many railway stations within the city limits and in the suburbs have been rebuilt or modernised and are now part of the \"S-Bahn Graz\", a commuter train service connecting the city with its suburban area and towns nearby.\nGraz airport is located about 10 km (6 mi) south of the city centre and is accessible by bus, railway, and car. Direct destinations include Amsterdam, Berlin, D\u00fcsseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart, Istanbul, Vienna and Zurich.\n\n\n== Health ==\nIn Graz there are seven hospitals, several private hospitals and sanatoriums, as well as 44 pharmacies.\nThe University Hospital Graz (LKH-Universit\u00e4ts-Klinikum Graz) is located in eastern Graz and has 1,556 beds and 7,190 employees.

Furthermore, several non-emergency ambulances (KTW \u2013 Krankentransportwagen) and a Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) are operated by the Red Cross to transport non-emergency patients to and between hospitals. In addition to the Red Cross, the Labourers'-Samaritan-Alliance (Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund \u00d6sterreichs), the Austrian organisation of the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps (Malteser Hospitaldienst Austria) and the Green Cross (Gr\u00fcnes Kreuz) operate ambulances (KTW) for non-emergency patient transport. In addition to the cars, there's also the C12 air ambulance helicopter stationed at Graz airport, staffed with an emergency physician in addition to regular personnel.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nGraz is twinned with:\n\nOther forms of cooperation and city friendship similar to the twin city programmes\n Ni\u0161, Serbia\n Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nThe following are past and present notable residents of Graz.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Austria portal\nList of World Heritage Sites in Austria\nKastner & \u00d6hler\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"Graz: Stadtplanung und Stadtentwicklung (Rechnungshofbericht, 2006) in German\" (PDF). 2006.

        "wiki": "Graz ( GRAHTS, German: [\u0261\u0281a\u02d0ts] (listen); Slovene: Gradec) is the capital city of Styria and Austria's second-largest city after Vienna. As of 1 January 2019, Graz had a population of 328,276 (292,269 of whom had principal-residence status). In 2015, the population of the Graz larger urban zone (LUZ) stood at 633,168, based on principal-residence status. Graz has a long tradition as a seat of higher education. It has four colleges and four universities with more than 60,000 students. Its historic centre  (Altstadt) is one of the best-preserved city centres in Central Europe.For centuries, Graz was more important to Slovenes and Croats, both politically and culturally, than the capitals of Ljubljana, Slovenia and Zagreb, Croatia; it remains influential to this day. In 1999, the city's historic centre was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites and in 2010 the designation was expanded to include Eggenberg Palace (German: Schloss Eggenberg) on the western edge of the city. Graz was designated the Cultural Capital of Europe in 2003 and became a City of Culinary Delights in 2008.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name of the city, Graz, formerly spelled Gratz, most likely stems from the Slavic gradec, which means \"small castle\". Some archaeological finds point to the erection of a small castle by Alpine Slavic people, which over time became a heavily defended fortification. In literary Slovene and Croatian, gradec still means \"small castle\", forming a hypocoristic derivative of Proto-West-South Slavic *grad\u044cc\u044a, whichs descends via liquid metathesis from Common Slavic *gard\u044cc\u044a and via the Slavic third palatalisation from Proto-Slavic *gardiku, originally denoting \"small town, settlement\". The name thus follows the common South Slavic pattern for naming settlements as grad. The German name 'Graz' first appears in records in 1128.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGraz is situated on both sides of the Mur river in southeast Austria. It is about 200 km (120 mi) southwest of Vienna (Wien). The nearest larger urban centre is Maribor (Marburg) in Slovenia, which is about 50 km (31 mi) to the south. Graz is the state capital and largest city in Styria, a green and heavily forested region on the eastern edge of the Alps.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring municipalities ===\nThese towns and villages border Graz:\n\nto the north: Gratkorn, Stattegg, Weinitzen\nto the east: Kainbach bei Graz, Hart bei Graz, Raaba\nto the south: G\u00f6ssendorf, Feldkirchen bei Graz, Seiersberg\nto the west: Attendorf, Thal, Judendorf-Stra\u00dfengel\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nGraz is divided into 17 municipal districts (Stadtbezirke):\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement on the ground of the modern city of Graz dates back to the Copper Age. However, no historical continuity exists of a settlement before the Middle Ages.\nDuring the 12th century, dukes under Babenberg rule made the town into an important commercial center. Later, Graz came under the rule of the Habsburgs and, in 1281, gained special privileges from King Rudolph I.\nIn the 14th century, Graz became the city of residence of the Inner Austrian line of the Habsburgs. The royalty lived in the Schlossberg castle and from there ruled Styria, Carinthia, most of today's Slovenia, and parts of Italy (Carniola, Gorizia and Gradisca, Trieste).\nIn the 16th century, the city's design and planning were primarily controlled by Italian Renaissance architects and artists. One of the most famous buildings representative of this style is the Landhaus, designed by Domenico dell'Allio, and used by the local rulers as a governmental headquarters.\n\nThe University of Graz was founded by Archduke Karl II in 1585, it's the city's oldest university. For most of its existence, it was controlled by the Catholic church, and was closed in 1782 by Joseph II in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a lyceum where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-established as a university by Emperor Franz I, and was named 'Karl-Franzens Universit\u00e4t' or 'Charles-Francis University' in English. More than 30,000 students are currently enrolled at this university.\nThe astronomer Johannes Kepler lived in Graz for a short period. He worked as a math teacher and was a professor of mathematics at the University of Graz, but still found time to study astronomy. He left Graz for Prague when Lutherans were banned from the city.\nLudwig Boltzmann was Professor for Mathematical Physics from 1869 to 1890. During that time, Nikola Tesla studied electrical engineering at the Polytechnic in 1875. Nobel Laureate Otto Loewi taught at the University of Graz from 1909 until 1938. Ivo Andric, the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature Laureate obtained his doctorate at the University of Graz. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger was briefly chancellor of the University of Graz in 1936.\nGraz is centrally located within today's Bundesland (state) of Styria, or Steiermark in German. Mark is an old German word indicating a large area of land used as a defensive border, in which the peasantry is taught how to organize and fight in the case of an invasion. With a strategic location at the head of the open and fertile Mur valley, Graz was historically a target of invaders, such as the Hungarians under Matthias Corvinus in 1481, and the Ottoman Turks in 1529 and 1532. Apart from the Riegersburg Castle, the Schlossberg was the only fortification in the region that never fell to the Ottoman Turks. Graz is home to the region's provincial armory, which is the world's largest historical collection of late medieval and Renaissance weaponry. It has been preserved since 1551, and displays over 30,000 items.\nFrom the earlier part of the 15th century, Graz was the residence of the younger branch of the Habsburgs, which succeeded to the imperial throne in 1619 in the person of Emperor Ferdinand II, who moved the capital to Vienna. New fortifications were built on the Schlossberg at the end of the 16th century. Napoleon's army occupied Graz in 1797. In 1809, the city withstood another assault by the French army. During this attack, the commanding officer in the fortress was ordered to defend it with about 900 men against Napoleon's army of about 3,000. He successfully defended the Schlossberg against eight attacks, but they were forced to give up after the Grande Arm\u00e9e occupied Vienna and the Emperor ordered to surrender. Following the defeat of Austria by Napoleonic forces at the Battle of Wagram in 1809, the fortifications were demolished using explosives, as stipulated in the Peace of Sch\u00f6nbrunn of the same year. The belltower (Glockenturm) and the civic clock tower (Uhrturm), which is a leading tourist attraction and serves as a symbol for Graz, were spared after the citizens of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation.Archduke Karl II of Inner Austria had 20,000 Protestant books burned in the square of what is now a mental hospital, and succeeded in returning Styria to the authority of the Holy See. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was born in Graz in what is now the Stadtmuseum (city museum).\n\n\n== Population development ==\nThe more recent population figures do not give the whole picture as only people with principal-residence status are counted and people with secondary residence status are not. Most of the people with secondary residence status in Graz are students. At the end of 2016 there were 33,473 people with secondary residence status in Graz.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nOceanic climate is the type found in the city, but due to the 0 \u00b0C isotherm, the same occurs in a humid continental climate with based in K\u00f6ppen system (Cfb/Dfb borderline). Wladimir K\u00f6ppen himself was in town and conducted studies to see how the climate of the past influenced the Continental Drift theory. Due to its position southeast of the Alps, Graz is shielded from the prevailing westerly winds that bring weather fronts in from the North Atlantic to northwestern and central Europe. The weather in Graz is thus influenced by the Mediterranean, and it has more hours of sunshine per year than Vienna or Salzburg and also less wind or rain. Graz lies in a basin that is only open to the south, causing the climate to be warmer than would be expected at that latitude. Plants are found in Graz that normally grow much further south.\n\naverage temperatures: Graz Airport 8.7 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) / Karl-Franzens University 9.4 \u00b0C (49 \u00b0F)\naverage rainfall: 818 mm (32 in) with on average 92 days of rain (Karl Franzens University)\naverage hours of sunshine: 1,989 (Karl Franzens University)\n\n\n== Slovenes and Graz ==\nPolitically, culturally, scientifically and religiously, Graz was an important centre for all Slovenes, especially from the establishment of the University of Graz in 1586 until the establishment of University of Ljubljana in 1919. In 1574, the first Slovene Catholic book was published in Graz, and in 1592, Hieronymus Megiser published in Graz the book Dictionarium quatuor linguarum, the first multilingual dictionary of Slovene.The Styrian Slovenes did not consider Graz a German-speaking city, but their own, a place to study while living at their relatives' homes and to fulfill one's career ambitions. The student associations in Graz were a crucible of the Slovene identity, and the Slovene students in Graz were more nationally aware than some others. This led to fierce anti-Slovene efforts of German-speaking nationalists in Graz before and during World War II.Many Slovenian Styrians study there. Slovenes are among the professors at the Institute for Jazz in Graz. Numerous Slovenes have found employment there, while being formerly unemployed in Slovenia. For the Slovene culture, Graz remains permanently important due to its university and the Universalmuseum Joanneum archives containing numerous documents from the Slovenian Styria.A symposium on the relation of Graz and the Slovenes was held in Graz in 2010, at the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the first and oldest chair of Slovene. It was established at the Lyzeum of Graz in July 1811 on the initiative of Janez Nepomuk Primic. A collection of lectures on the topic was published. The Slovenian Post commemorated the anniversary with a stamp.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nFor the year that Graz was Cultural Capital of Europe, new structures were erected. The Graz Museum of Contemporary Art (German: Kunsthaus) was designed by Peter Cook and Colin Fournier and is situated next to the Mur river. The Island in the Mur is a floating platform made of steel. It was designed by American architect Vito Acconci and contains a caf\u00e9, an open-air theatre and a playground.\n\n\n=== Historic city centre ===\n\nThe historic centre was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999 due to the harmonious co-existence of typical buildings from different epochs and in different architectural styles. Situated in a cultural borderland between Central Europe, Italy and the Balkan States, Graz absorbed various influences from the neighbouring regions and thus received its exceptional townscape. Today the historic centre consists of over 1,000 buildings, their age ranging from Gothic to contemporary.\nThe most important sights in the historic centre are:\n\nTown Hall (Rathaus).\nThe Castle hill (German: Schlossberg), a hill dominating the historic centre (475 m (1,558.40 ft) high), site of a demolished fortress, with views over Graz.\nThe Clock Tower (Uhrturm) is a symbol of Graz, at the top of the Castle hill.\nThe New Gallery (Neue Galerie), a museum of art.\nThe Castle hill funicular (Schlossbergbahn), a funicular railway on the Castle hill's slope.\nThe seat of Styria's provincial parliament (Landhaus), a palace in Lombardic style.

It features the oldest painted view of Graz.\nThe mausoleum of Emperor Ferdinand II next to the cathedral, the most important building of Mannerism in Graz. It includes both the grave where Ferdinand II and his wife are buried, and a church dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria.\nThe Castle (Burg), with Gothic double staircase, built between 1438 and 1453 by Emperor Frederick III, because the old castle on the Schlossberg hill was too small and uncomfortable.

The Grazer ORF, the Graz subsidiary of Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, launched an initiative in 2008 called Scho wieda Steirisch g'redt in order to highlight the numerous dialects of Graz and Styria in general and to cultivate the pride many Styrians hold for their local culture. Two reasons for a melding of these dialects with Standard German: the influence of television and radio bringing Standard German into the home and the industrialization causing the disappearance of the single farmer since the farming communities are seen as the true keepers of dialect speaking.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nAn extensive public transport network makes Graz an easy city to navigate without a car. The city has a comprehensive bus network, complementing the Graz tram network consisting of eight lines. Four lines pass through the underground tram stop at the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof) and on to the city centre before branching out. Furthermore, there are seven night-time bus routes, although these run only at weekends and on evenings preceding public holidays.\nThe Schlossbergbahn, a funicular railway, and the Schlossberg lift, a vertical lift, link the city centre to the Schlossberg.\nFrom the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), regional trains link to most of Styria. Direct trains run to most major cities nearby including Vienna, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Maribor and Ljubljana in Slovenia, Zagreb in Croatia, Budapest in Hungary, Prague and Brno in the Czech Republic, Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland, as well as Munich, Stuttgart, Heidelberg, and Frankfurt in Germany. Trains for Vienna leave every hour. In recent years many railway stations within the city limits and in the suburbs have been rebuilt or modernised and are now part of the \"S-Bahn Graz\", a commuter train service connecting the city with its suburban area and towns nearby.\nGraz airport is located about 10 km (6 mi) south of the city centre and is accessible by bus, railway, and car. Direct destinations include Amsterdam, Berlin, D\u00fcsseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart, Istanbul, Vienna and Zurich.\n\n\n== Health ==\nIn Graz there are seven hospitals, several private hospitals and sanatoriums, as well as 44 pharmacies.\nThe University Hospital Graz (LKH-Universit\u00e4ts-Klinikum Graz) is located in eastern Graz and has 1,556 beds and 7,190 employees. The Regional Hospital Graz II (LKH Graz II) has two sites in Graz. The western site (LKH Graz II Standort West) is located in Eggenberg and has 280 beds and about 500 employees, the southern site (LKH Graz II Standort S\u00fcd) specializes in neurology and psychiatry and is located in Stra\u00dfgang with 880 beds and 1,100 employees. The AUVA Accident Hospital (Unfallkrankenhaus der AUVA) is in Eggenberg and has 180 beds and a total of 444 employees.\nThe Albert Schweitzer Clinic in the western part of the city is a geriatric hospital with 304 beds, the Hospital of St. John of God (Krankenhaus der Barmherzigen Br\u00fcder) has two sites in Graz, one in Lend with 225 beds and one in Eggenberg with 260 beds. The Hospital of the Order of Saint Elizabeth (Krankenhaus der Elisabethinen) in Gries has 182 beds.\nThere are several private clinics as well: the Privatklinik Kastanienhof, the Privatklinik Leech, the Privatklinik der Kreuzschwestern, the Sanatorium St. Leonhard, the Sanatorium Hansa and the Privatklinik Graz-Ragnitz.\nEMS in Graz is provided solely by the Austrian Red Cross. Perpetually two emergency doctor's cars (NEF \u2013 Notarzteinsatzfahrzeug), two NAWs (Notarztwagen \u2013 ambulances staffed with a physician in addition to regular personnel) and about 30 RTWs (Rettungswagen \u2013 regular ambulances) are on standby. Furthermore, several non-emergency ambulances (KTW \u2013 Krankentransportwagen) and a Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) are operated by the Red Cross to transport non-emergency patients to and between hospitals. In addition to the Red Cross, the Labourers'-Samaritan-Alliance (Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund \u00d6sterreichs), the Austrian organisation of the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps (Malteser Hospitaldienst Austria) and the Green Cross (Gr\u00fcnes Kreuz) operate ambulances (KTW) for non-emergency patient transport. In addition to the cars, there's also the C12 air ambulance helicopter stationed at Graz airport, staffed with an emergency physician in addition to regular personnel.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nGraz is twinned with:\n\nOther forms of cooperation and city friendship similar to the twin city programmes\n Ni\u0161, Serbia\n Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nThe following are past and present notable residents of Graz.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Austria portal\nList of World Heritage Sites in Austria\nKastner & \u00d6hler\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"Graz: Stadtplanung und Stadtentwicklung (Rechnungshofbericht, 2006) in German\" (PDF). 2006.

          "Impressive structure. A warm sitting area at reception with lots of books and small things on sale. Great cafe open till late.",
          "If you're a jolly person and want to happy in your own room, hotel's security officer might be indecent enough to knock your door at night and ask you to be QUITE,  while you're talking and laughing out loud.\nThey have a good view and foods are good",
          "It would be a great experience to visit the gallery, only if there\u2019s some great exhibitions. It\u2019s not a good thing for visitors from far away to come here and see nothing but a simple small exhibition in a single room. Without fixed exhibitions can people hardly stay here for more than 30 minutes. A great architecture anyway.",
          "At the moment that I was here (end of February 2020) there was no exhibition so basically nothing to see here. Personell was friendly when telling us that there was no exhibition and mentioned some alternatives to us.\n\nThe building itself \u2026",
          "It's such a striking exterior when walking in old school Graz, this building calls you in. Unlike the ill-fated blimp I seem to attach to the shape, this space lands with grace and style!  The interior is an experience in Austrian cool, \u2026",
          "I only went to the bar, but it seems to be a hip and happening place",
          "Good tour guide that led us through our Kunshaus and it was easy walking around the levels",
          "Very contemporary structure form,  modern in the inside, quite particular in the outside, even its colour a particular and characteristic shade of  blue... One of the sightseeing of the city you can detect it immediately from the clock \u2026",
          "nice place from the outside and the inside... the Caf\u00e9 is one of the coolest in Graz... and it has one of the best burgers in town !!",
          "A very unique museum that has amazing exhibitions which are creatively displayed. If you catch it at the right time, there's also a robotically played concert for you, accompanying a film. The souvenir shop was also very good. My only complaint was that it was not that big, but definitely a good place to visit in Graz.",
          "Very nice atmosphere, quick service, great coffee. Staff can be more polite",
          "Really nice if you would this kind of places, but a little bit small",

          "Nice building, and nice people working there.",
          "Only 2 exposition rooms and not really interesting in my opinion. But if you have 45min and 3euros (for student) and you know what you want to do you can go over there!",
          "Solid exibith on the first floor. Very good on the second floor with audio visual elements. Has a nice view on the top floor.",

          "The vast majority of the museum was closed because they were changing exhibits.  The needle was ok, get some views of the city.  The design of the building is pretty neat.  There was no robot concert.  The photography exhibit was meh at \u2026",
          "Very interesting place. I could spend there whole day interpreting things, but I am too stupid to understand everything. But it's okay, it's always good to know that you are stupid.",
          "Curious shape, nice bookshop inside and amazing temporary moder art exhibitions.",
          "The museum's architecture alone make it worth seeing and visiting (entering). As for the exhibits inside, I can only speak for what was on when I visited and it was underwhelming or I suppose hard to understand like much of contemporary art and it is a contemporary art museum so...",
          "Modern art is not my thing. The stuff there is just totally meaningless. At least it is not worth 9\u20ac of its ticket price",
          "currently has a wonderful light/sound show on that i would call a must-see for anyone visiting graz right now",
          "Didn't visit the museum but the bar next to it. Can recommend: Very tasty spritzers and tasty beers. Atmosphere is great and staff was friendly. Only had to wait a bit long before they come take your order.",
          "Great place to visit. Also worth to try the food at the restaurant!",
          "We only took a tour, that allowed us to go to one place in the museum. The museum is quite the looker!  Very nicely done!",
          "Nicely organized venue with interesting content and very friendly staff! I recommend it to all fans of contemporary art. They also have a nice caf\u00e8 bistro. 11/10",
          "The food is very good but the service could be quicker...",
          "Museum of Modern Art. It was closed at night. The building is very interesting.",
          "Archigram at its best !",
          "Great exhibitions and good price!",
          "Definitely worth a visit with the interesting architecture and gift shop. Enjoyed the exhibits I saw and was probably there for 2 hours",
          "Not a very big place but interesting nonetheless, especially if you're interested in modern art.",
          "The Kunsthaus Graz, Grazer Kunsthaus is a museum of contemporary art built in 2003. I did not visit it, but the shape of this building immediately caught my eye because of its originality.",
          "Architecturally, the Kunsthaus is a thing of beauty - a work of art. Inside is equally impressive. The exhibitions are nicely curated. 'Camera Austria' is currently displayed.",
          "The needle has nice views. The rest of the museum is just what you need to get a headache. Hall 2 completely dark and showing images that are created to cause nausea. Hall 1 has this noisy music set up that is just that noise - 91 decibels \u2026",
          "Nice building and exhibits of contemporary art",
          "Museum and exhibition with a nice shop and free toilets.",

          "Amazing Krampus parade in Graz!",
          "The place seems to be very warm and welcoming, but during the rush hours, the staff seems to be very stressed. However, the food is an art, and their drinks are exquisite so five stars it is.",

          "It really worths the experience! But a ticket and enjoy it",
          "More interesting from outside than from the inside.",
          "An interesting architectional desicion. Place of modern art. There i\u0161 a caffe beside. About 10eur admission. An 30min to 1 hour enough if you are not a fan of modern art.",
          "It was quite modern art, but I liked it.",
          "Beautiful design but ..in the middle of vintage buildings",
          "Good exhibition. Expected it to have more though.",
          "The ticket was affordable, 3.7 euros for students (and i study in slovenia, it did not matter that i was not an austriac student which is great). The souvenirs are kind of expensive. The museum is great",

          "Interesting, especially second floor.",
          "An impressive piece of architecture. A must see.",
          "Very cool to look at from the outside. It really fits the name \"Alien\" but the exhibit inside is small and people tend to say the interior is not as cool as the exterior. Also for the euros you must pay to enter, the amount of art and installations inside dont seem worth the price. Still cool though!",
          "Wide variety of food which is really well made, trendy and great atmosphere",
          "Amazing exterior architecture, adds nicely to the skyline and very interesting to see from places such as the castle.\nInside on the bottom floor they have a store and a caf\u00e9/restaurant which is quite expensive.\nThe exhibition was alright, \u2026",
          "So beautiful / elegant / simple and plain",
          "Small exhibition, but very interesting",
          "Architecturally and artistically riveting. The art displayed is thought-provoking. However, for the average person, the art will be gotten through in less than an hour since there aren't many artworks. Comes with a free audioguide about the architectural space of the museum, which is good.",
          "Very interesting and inspirating place...",
          "Unfortunately haven`t had a chance to visit museum itself, but grab a beer in the bar. The bar is nice, the waiters are nice.",
          "The breakfast was very good. The place deserves visiting.",

          "Always good",
          "Looks massive from the outside but very small inside. Not at all what I imagined being inside an alien would be like at all. It's got a great view over the river from the top floor balcony.",
          "best place",
          "Smaller exhibition than expected for the price. Beautiful building and friendly staff.",
          "The place for modern art, sometimes mainstream, but never really bad stuff",

          "Nice building",
          "it's alright, think have to pay to see anything, the architecture quite cool when see it from up the hill",
          "It's an ok museum, a little small and when I went one of the floors was closed. They had an exhibition about Ghana and its history which was interesting from a historical perspective but not from an art perspective. There is a deck at the \u2026",

          "Favourite place to have breakfast, lunch, dinner or get a drink in the evening. The food is super delicious, I can especially recommend the \"Kaspresskn\u00f6del Suppe\". They also have vegetarian and vegan options that are very tasty. Prices are \u2026",
          "This place is really amazing",

          "One of the most iconic buildings in Graz. Special architecture (full glass and metal look and that iconic shape) of museum that you can't see anywhere else. Definitely worth it! Also, the view from the top is amazing. If you are going on sightseeing of Gratz this is a must-see!",

          "Mixed feelings about this one. The exhibit isn't that great but the shop and the architecture make up for it. Also a bit pricey to visit. In all honesty you can skip it and will not miss out much! Just walk by and look at it! The wow factor is only on the outside! ",
          "Good place to visit with kids",
          "The building itself is extremely unique, and worth the visit on its own. The exhibition we saw, about religion, has some odd moments, and requires some background in the subject matter to really get the most out of it but was interesting overall.

        "wiki": "Graz ( GRAHTS, German: [\u0261\u0281a\u02d0ts] (listen); Slovene: Gradec) is the capital city of Styria and Austria's second-largest city after Vienna. As of 1 January 2019, Graz had a population of 328,276 (292,269 of whom had principal-residence status). In 2015, the population of the Graz larger urban zone (LUZ) stood at 633,168, based on principal-residence status. Graz has a long tradition as a seat of higher education. It has four colleges and four universities with more than 60,000 students. Its historic centre  (Altstadt) is one of the best-preserved city centres in Central Europe.For centuries, Graz was more important to Slovenes and Croats, both politically and culturally, than the capitals of Ljubljana, Slovenia and Zagreb, Croatia; it remains influential to this day. In 1999, the city's historic centre was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites and in 2010 the designation was expanded to include Eggenberg Palace (German: Schloss Eggenberg) on the western edge of the city. Graz was designated the Cultural Capital of Europe in 2003 and became a City of Culinary Delights in 2008.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name of the city, Graz, formerly spelled Gratz, most likely stems from the Slavic gradec, which means \"small castle\". Some archaeological finds point to the erection of a small castle by Alpine Slavic people, which over time became a heavily defended fortification. In literary Slovene and Croatian, gradec still means \"small castle\", forming a hypocoristic derivative of Proto-West-South Slavic *grad\u044cc\u044a, whichs descends via liquid metathesis from Common Slavic *gard\u044cc\u044a and via the Slavic third palatalisation from Proto-Slavic *gardiku, originally denoting \"small town, settlement\". The name thus follows the common South Slavic pattern for naming settlements as grad. The German name 'Graz' first appears in records in 1128.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGraz is situated on both sides of the Mur river in southeast Austria. It is about 200 km (120 mi) southwest of Vienna (Wien). The nearest larger urban centre is Maribor (Marburg) in Slovenia, which is about 50 km (31 mi) to the south. Graz is the state capital and largest city in Styria, a green and heavily forested region on the eastern edge of the Alps.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring municipalities ===\nThese towns and villages border Graz:\n\nto the north: Gratkorn, Stattegg, Weinitzen\nto the east: Kainbach bei Graz, Hart bei Graz, Raaba\nto the south: G\u00f6ssendorf, Feldkirchen bei Graz, Seiersberg\nto the west: Attendorf, Thal, Judendorf-Stra\u00dfengel\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nGraz is divided into 17 municipal districts (Stadtbezirke):\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement on the ground of the modern city of Graz dates back to the Copper Age. However, no historical continuity exists of a settlement before the Middle Ages.\nDuring the 12th century, dukes under Babenberg rule made the town into an important commercial center. Later, Graz came under the rule of the Habsburgs and, in 1281, gained special privileges from King Rudolph I.\nIn the 14th century, Graz became the city of residence of the Inner Austrian line of the Habsburgs. The royalty lived in the Schlossberg castle and from there ruled Styria, Carinthia, most of today's Slovenia, and parts of Italy (Carniola, Gorizia and Gradisca, Trieste).\nIn the 16th century, the city's design and planning were primarily controlled by Italian Renaissance architects and artists. One of the most famous buildings representative of this style is the Landhaus, designed by Domenico dell'Allio, and used by the local rulers as a governmental headquarters.\n\nThe University of Graz was founded by Archduke Karl II in 1585, it's the city's oldest university. For most of its existence, it was controlled by the Catholic church, and was closed in 1782 by Joseph II in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a lyceum where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-established as a university by Emperor Franz I, and was named 'Karl-Franzens Universit\u00e4t' or 'Charles-Francis University' in English. More than 30,000 students are currently enrolled at this university.\nThe astronomer Johannes Kepler lived in Graz for a short period. He worked as a math teacher and was a professor of mathematics at the University of Graz, but still found time to study astronomy. He left Graz for Prague when Lutherans were banned from the city.\nLudwig Boltzmann was Professor for Mathematical Physics from 1869 to 1890. During that time, Nikola Tesla studied electrical engineering at the Polytechnic in 1875. Nobel Laureate Otto Loewi taught at the University of Graz from 1909 until 1938. Ivo Andric, the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature Laureate obtained his doctorate at the University of Graz. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger was briefly chancellor of the University of Graz in 1936.\nGraz is centrally located within today's Bundesland (state) of Styria, or Steiermark in German. Mark is an old German word indicating a large area of land used as a defensive border, in which the peasantry is taught how to organize and fight in the case of an invasion. With a strategic location at the head of the open and fertile Mur valley, Graz was historically a target of invaders, such as the Hungarians under Matthias Corvinus in 1481, and the Ottoman Turks in 1529 and 1532. Apart from the Riegersburg Castle, the Schlossberg was the only fortification in the region that never fell to the Ottoman Turks. Graz is home to the region's provincial armory, which is the world's largest historical collection of late medieval and Renaissance weaponry. It has been preserved since 1551, and displays over 30,000 items.\nFrom the earlier part of the 15th century, Graz was the residence of the younger branch of the Habsburgs, which succeeded to the imperial throne in 1619 in the person of Emperor Ferdinand II, who moved the capital to Vienna. New fortifications were built on the Schlossberg at the end of the 16th century. Napoleon's army occupied Graz in 1797. In 1809, the city withstood another assault by the French army. During this attack, the commanding officer in the fortress was ordered to defend it with about 900 men against Napoleon's army of about 3,000. He successfully defended the Schlossberg against eight attacks, but they were forced to give up after the Grande Arm\u00e9e occupied Vienna and the Emperor ordered to surrender. Following the defeat of Austria by Napoleonic forces at the Battle of Wagram in 1809, the fortifications were demolished using explosives, as stipulated in the Peace of Sch\u00f6nbrunn of the same year. The belltower (Glockenturm) and the civic clock tower (Uhrturm), which is a leading tourist attraction and serves as a symbol for Graz, were spared after the citizens of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation.Archduke Karl II of Inner Austria had 20,000 Protestant books burned in the square of what is now a mental hospital, and succeeded in returning Styria to the authority of the Holy See. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was born in Graz in what is now the Stadtmuseum (city museum).\n\n\n== Population development ==\nThe more recent population figures do not give the whole picture as only people with principal-residence status are counted and people with secondary residence status are not. Most of the people with secondary residence status in Graz are students. At the end of 2016 there were 33,473 people with secondary residence status in Graz.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nOceanic climate is the type found in the city, but due to the 0 \u00b0C isotherm, the same occurs in a humid continental climate with based in K\u00f6ppen system (Cfb/Dfb borderline). Wladimir K\u00f6ppen himself was in town and conducted studies to see how the climate of the past influenced the Continental Drift theory. Due to its position southeast of the Alps, Graz is shielded from the prevailing westerly winds that bring weather fronts in from the North Atlantic to northwestern and central Europe. The weather in Graz is thus influenced by the Mediterranean, and it has more hours of sunshine per year than Vienna or Salzburg and also less wind or rain. Graz lies in a basin that is only open to the south, causing the climate to be warmer than would be expected at that latitude. Plants are found in Graz that normally grow much further south.\n\naverage temperatures: Graz Airport 8.7 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) / Karl-Franzens University 9.4 \u00b0C (49 \u00b0F)\naverage rainfall: 818 mm (32 in) with on average 92 days of rain (Karl Franzens University)\naverage hours of sunshine: 1,989 (Karl Franzens University)\n\n\n== Slovenes and Graz ==\nPolitically, culturally, scientifically and religiously, Graz was an important centre for all Slovenes, especially from the establishment of the University of Graz in 1586 until the establishment of University of Ljubljana in 1919. In 1574, the first Slovene Catholic book was published in Graz, and in 1592, Hieronymus Megiser published in Graz the book Dictionarium quatuor linguarum, the first multilingual dictionary of Slovene.The Styrian Slovenes did not consider Graz a German-speaking city, but their own, a place to study while living at their relatives' homes and to fulfill one's career ambitions. The student associations in Graz were a crucible of the Slovene identity, and the Slovene students in Graz were more nationally aware than some others. This led to fierce anti-Slovene efforts of German-speaking nationalists in Graz before and during World War II.Many Slovenian Styrians study there. Slovenes are among the professors at the Institute for Jazz in Graz. Numerous Slovenes have found employment there, while being formerly unemployed in Slovenia. For the Slovene culture, Graz remains permanently important due to its university and the Universalmuseum Joanneum archives containing numerous documents from the Slovenian Styria.A symposium on the relation of Graz and the Slovenes was held in Graz in 2010, at the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the first and oldest chair of Slovene. It was established at the Lyzeum of Graz in July 1811 on the initiative of Janez Nepomuk Primic. A collection of lectures on the topic was published. The Slovenian Post commemorated the anniversary with a stamp.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nFor the year that Graz was Cultural Capital of Europe, new structures were erected. The Graz Museum of Contemporary Art (German: Kunsthaus) was designed by Peter Cook and Colin Fournier and is situated next to the Mur river. The Island in the Mur is a floating platform made of steel. It was designed by American architect Vito Acconci and contains a caf\u00e9, an open-air theatre and a playground.\n\n\n=== Historic city centre ===\n\nThe historic centre was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999 due to the harmonious co-existence of typical buildings from different epochs and in different architectural styles. Situated in a cultural borderland between Central Europe, Italy and the Balkan States, Graz absorbed various influences from the neighbouring regions and thus received its exceptional townscape. Today the historic centre consists of over 1,000 buildings, their age ranging from Gothic to contemporary.\nThe most important sights in the historic centre are:\n\nTown Hall (Rathaus).\nThe Castle hill (German: Schlossberg), a hill dominating the historic centre (475 m (1,558.40 ft) high), site of a demolished fortress, with views over Graz.\nThe Clock Tower (Uhrturm) is a symbol of Graz, at the top of the Castle hill.\nThe New Gallery (Neue Galerie), a museum of art.\nThe Castle hill funicular (Schlossbergbahn), a funicular railway on the Castle hill's slope.\nThe seat of Styria's provincial parliament (Landhaus), a palace in Lombardic style.

It is the 2nd largest opera house in Austria.\nThe Graz Theatre (Schauspielhaus), Graz's principal theatre for productions of plays.\nThe Cathedral (Dom), a rare monument of Gothic architecture. Once, there were many frescos on the outer walls; today, only a few remain, like the Landplagenbild (\"picture of plagues\") painted in 1485, presumably by Thomas von Villach. The three plagues it depicts are locusts, pestilence and the invasion of the Turks, all of them striking the town in 1480. It features the oldest painted view of Graz.\nThe mausoleum of Emperor Ferdinand II next to the cathedral, the most important building of Mannerism in Graz. It includes both the grave where Ferdinand II and his wife are buried, and a church dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria.\nThe Castle (Burg), with Gothic double staircase, built between 1438 and 1453 by Emperor Frederick III, because the old castle on the Schlossberg hill was too small and uncomfortable. The castle remained the residence of the Inner Austrian Court until 1619. Today, it serves as residence for the Styrian government.\nThe Painted House (Gemaltes Haus) in Herrengasse 3. It is completely covered with frescos (painted in 1742 by Johann Mayer).\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art Graz (Kunsthaus)\nThe Island in the Mur (Murinsel), an artificial island in the Mur river.\nBuildings, inner courtyards (e. g.

In the outer districts buildings are predominantly of the architectural styles from the second half of the 20th century.\nIn 1965 the Grazer Schule (School of Graz) was founded. Several buildings around the universities are of this style, for example the green houses by Volker Giencke and the RESOWI center by G\u00fcnther Domenig.\nBefore Graz became the European Capital of Culture in 2003, several new projects were realized, such as the Stadthalle, the Kindermuseum (museum for children), the Helmut-List-Halle, the Kunsthaus and the Murinsel.\n\nTallest buildings\nBuildings in Graz which are at least 50m tall: \n\n\n=== Sports ===\nSK Sturm Graz is the main football club of the city, with three Austrian championships and five runner-up seasons. The Grazer AK also won an Austrian championship, but went into administration in 2007 and was excluded from the professional league system.\nIn ice hockey, the ATSE Graz was the Austrian Hockey League champion in 1975 and 1978.

It's still facing referendum, meaning usually the end for many former olympic bids in Europe and North America since 1970 -century.\n\n\n=== Styriarte ===\nGraz hosts the annual festival of classical music Styriarte, founded in 1985 to tie conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt closer to his hometown. Events have been held at different venues in Graz and in the surrounding region.\n\n\n=== Dialect ===\nReferred to as Steirisch by locals, Graz belongs to the Austro-Bavarian region of dialects, more specifically a mix of Central Bavarian in the western part of Styria and Southern Bavarian in the eastern part. The Grazer ORF, the Graz subsidiary of Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, launched an initiative in 2008 called Scho wieda Steirisch g'redt in order to highlight the numerous dialects of Graz and Styria in general and to cultivate the pride many Styrians hold for their local culture. Two reasons for a melding of these dialects with Standard German: the influence of television and radio bringing Standard German into the home and the industrialization causing the disappearance of the single farmer since the farming communities are seen as the true keepers of dialect speaking.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nAn extensive public transport network makes Graz an easy city to navigate without a car. The city has a comprehensive bus network, complementing the Graz tram network consisting of eight lines. Four lines pass through the underground tram stop at the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof) and on to the city centre before branching out. Furthermore, there are seven night-time bus routes, although these run only at weekends and on evenings preceding public holidays.\nThe Schlossbergbahn, a funicular railway, and the Schlossberg lift, a vertical lift, link the city centre to the Schlossberg.\nFrom the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), regional trains link to most of Styria. Direct trains run to most major cities nearby including Vienna, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Maribor and Ljubljana in Slovenia, Zagreb in Croatia, Budapest in Hungary, Prague and Brno in the Czech Republic, Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland, as well as Munich, Stuttgart, Heidelberg, and Frankfurt in Germany.

Perpetually two emergency doctor's cars (NEF \u2013 Notarzteinsatzfahrzeug), two NAWs (Notarztwagen \u2013 ambulances staffed with a physician in addition to regular personnel) and about 30 RTWs (Rettungswagen \u2013 regular ambulances) are on standby. Furthermore, several non-emergency ambulances (KTW \u2013 Krankentransportwagen) and a Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) are operated by the Red Cross to transport non-emergency patients to and between hospitals. In addition to the Red Cross, the Labourers'-Samaritan-Alliance (Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund \u00d6sterreichs), the Austrian organisation of the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps (Malteser Hospitaldienst Austria) and the Green Cross (Gr\u00fcnes Kreuz) operate ambulances (KTW) for non-emergency patient transport.

          "A really stunning installation! Absolutely worth the visit .. try to take some time for a coffee and a read!",
          "Probably quite an expensive project to complete. It did have locals divided when it was planned. It is a little odd how this advertised as we understood this open till 10pm but when we arrived at 8pm it was closed and nos sign of anyone at all clearing up even, so it was shut",
          "The architecture is intriguing. The interior delightful to the eye. There is such attention to detail, curvature that plays off the river outside. I giggled at two ladies who lined up just to see the interior of the ship memento youknowwhat room. If in Graz, stop by. You will",
          "I love the vibe inside, from the great architecture, to seeing the river right next to you. The coffee was great and the prices are regular prices, super reasonable. Defintley going back, and 100% recommend it.",
          "Great idea to build the terrace and the restaurant in the middle of the river. It was nice to sit down and have a small drink, not hot even in the middle of the August day.",
          "After seeing all the usual suspects (Altstadt, Uhrturm, Sclossberg und so weiter) - all very neat and predictable - it was a relief to discover Murinsel by accident. A UFO landed in the middle of the river! Go see it - Murinsel (meaning: Island in River Mur) is by far Graz\u2019",
          "It's a nice sight to see, a modern installation in an old part of the city, new with the old. Worth a walkthrough.",
          "If you like a modern architecture, don't miss the island in the Mur. The entrance is free, but you can stay for a while in a modern restaurant inside. I recommend to stay - order at least the tap water and look at the river outside and modern interior. The staff is nice. The",
          "We very much enjoyed the modern architecture. The cafe inside is very nice, air conditioned, very comfortable, nice chilled music and the drinks are not at all expensive, we liked this rest spot.",
          "The island was built when Graz was the European city of culture. It connects both river banks. On the island is a bar and a summer theater. I can imagine how on hot summer days people enjoy in excellent culture. Architecture is fascinating.",
          "Astonishing site, artificial island in the middle of river Mur. Great place to experience the fast mountain river.",
          "An iconic glass facade Island in the center of River Mur. Near by to the city center wth a cafe. easily approachable by small bridge leading to this place. One can enjoy the river closely as elevators are installed to take you to the river banks.",
          "Unique structure in the middle of the water. Worth to stop just to take a look. Don\u2019t need to buy something and the toilet are worth to take a look at!!",
          "It is na artificial island in the river. You can have some drinks at the bar. They are open everyday for visitors.",
          "We did a quick walk thru as the restaurant wasn\u2019t open. A neat way to cross over the river and it\u2019s free.",
          "There is only bridge to cross it and inside the metal body there is a 2 cafe open air and closed one",
          "Located in the middle of the Mur river, this place and caffee are interesting and deserve a visit. Service is ok. Try the bathrooms for another sensitive experience (multi-reflexes).",
          "the swimming island, very interesting constructed, contains an amphitheatre, a shop and a nice coffee-bar.",
          "Don't get too excited as it's just a foot bridge that goes over the river. Cafe onsite but we didn't use, although busy with events in the summer months. Best highlight is the column of the bridge which lights up neon blue at night. The city has much better to offer than this..",
          "The Murinsel in Graz is a destination for visitors to Graz but it is also has a practical use as a walking bridge across the Mur. I've visited in summer when there was an operatic performance and in winter when there was a stall selling mulled wine. It lights up in the evening.",
          "We watched some guys hit the muir for a bit of surfing around this bridge and Island. What a great view, and also fabulous architecture.",
          "An interesting idea to build a man-made island in the middle of the river Mur...Its architecture is not too beautiful, but it contains a pedestrian bridge which is useful.",
          "It is very strange building in the middle of the river Mora, use as bridge, shop, coffee and also place where you can rest while summer time. In the evening in shine in blue and green colors, nice but I dont like its idea in the middle of old town with historic bilding in",
          "We went in soon after arriving in Graz hoping to get lunch, but no such luck. Still, a refreshing drink and a 'low calorie' cake (not) gave us sufficient energy to go up to the Schloss on the train and walk around for an hour or two",
          "Hard to miss; nice to hang out for drinks or snacks, prices OK. When we were there, we were evacuated by the fire brigade because a big tree trunk had hit the static island, possibly threatening its stability. So, free \"entertainment\" from the river bank watching the fire",
          "Enter this artificial insel from either side of the river Mur, have a coffe on the staircase (!) or, visit the restaurant or the shop, Absolutely outstanding!",
          "This island is built in the middle of the swift River Mur. Apart from its use as a foot bridge connecting both sides of the river, there is a restaurant for sit down dining. With so much water flowing at both sides, it is like sitting next to a water fall. Sound of water is",
          "Bar waitress had a little fight when we came so we waited about 20 minutes but overall the atmosphere is really nice.",
          "Artificial metal island, two connections or bridges to it and average cafe are one of the attractions in Graz. Place is monument of Graz - cultural capital of Europe 2003. Metal construction is interesting. Sometimes they organize evening events on the island. Check it during",
          "Lovely relaxed atmosphere, our children were very excited to eat on the island in the middle of the river. Staff were friendly, food very nice, good choice of food. A little expensive,but worth it for the experience. Outside seating needs a few umbrellas to keep the sun off.",
          "When we saw the Mur Island on the internet and leaned that it contained a coffee shop, we decided to stop for a coffee and enjoy the modern structure and the coffee shop. The metal structure is exciting I liked it from a structural point of view along with the island idea. The",
          "Take the time to appreciate the lighting effects at night on the bridge and the island, they are very nice both while on the structures and while viewing them from afar. We were only able to walk across as there was preparation ongoing for what looked to be a big affair, so we",
          "Cool spot to spend some time. Food was good and space was comfortable. Service was excellent. Would be great spot to be in summer also as they had a deck outside over river.",
          "It is an original little island made in the middle of the ''M\u00fcr''. I would not plan it in a day or in your trip, if you pass by, take a look and enjoy the river and a nice view.",
          "We were just passing by the river when this interesting bridge caught our eyes. It\u2019s certainly worth exploring and would be a fantastic place to chill in the height of summer.",
          "how wonderful! it's cozy and quaint. you sit in this very unique restaurant and sip you wine and enjoy something to eat while watching the river. i've never seen anything like this before.",
          "Built for city of culture more than a decade ago still an iconic piece of floating architecture as bridge / cafe / restaurant. Worth a detour to combine with the other modern architectural gem the Kunsthaus. Sit down have a coffee relax a while on a floating carpet. Do not miss",
          "Saw this while passing by and went inside. It\u2019s super interesting how they built this, and is worth a visit. Go inside for weird drinks like the \u201cCool Passion\u201d, which is a double espresso with passion fruit, ice cubes, and cream.",
          "An interesting piece of architecture, right in the middle of the Mur. This is where nature and man-made collide. It's a nice little cafe serving simple dishes, but mostly desserts and drinks. Inside the dome is the non-smoking section, great for hiding out from the cold, and",
          "a beautiful restaurant coffee on the midle of the river..something prototype and strange..i think is something beautifull to see..",
          "Graz is a beautiful city. I was particularly smitten by the Murinsel. It is just so quirky and practical. It is a bridge, a cafe, a small shop, and a work of art. The cafe inside of it is adorable and the sandwhiches are tasty. The bread comes from Graz's famous Hofb\u00e4ckerei",
          "Swimming island on the Mur river. Rest of the 2003 cultural year. Nice terrace, nice bar, nice shop of local design. Should be a must on your visit in Graz.",
          "A very unique design and function. Although the restaurant was closed when we went, the bridge and structure was really worth the visit.",
          "A unique feature of Graz, visually stunning, more so when lit up at night. We visited after walking back from Schloss Eggenberg to have a rest in the cafe and enjoy a cocktail. The service was slow (thankfully we were only one of three customers) but on the positive side, it was",
          "This island was created as an architectural highlight for the Graz's World Culture City designation. Unfortunately, the island has had to be resecured to its moorings. It is interesting to walk across, but the restaurant and shop do not generate enough revenue to even maintain",
          "Interesting way of river presentation. Stainless still island in the middle of the river. Sitting and having coffee enjoying artworks and looking to the water stream. Perfect",
          "The interior of the cafe is no attraction, nor are the drinks. I ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail and I didn't like it. It's a bit pricey. If you're just in for the sight-seeing, you can pass through the place, as it acts as a bridge, you don't have to enter the cafe",
          "A lovely place to look at when it it dark and the building is lit up. There is an open cinema house and a bar where one can get interesting cocktails there.",
          "The Murinsel is not really anything to look at in the daytime, but at night it is lit up blue which gives some good photo opportunities from the bridge next to it.",
          "Interesting architecture, free of charge for visitors, excellent store for modern souvenirs. We had coffee at reasonable price, staff was polite. Good place to kill half and hour.",
          "Went to see this just because it is so unique. There is an amphitheater and a coffee shop/bar in the Murinsel and the views are wonderful. At night, the Murinsel puts on a light show, changing colors from blue to green, yellow, red, pink and purple. Interesting, modern design",
          "During our city walk we visited also the so called Murinsel. Nice to see this art object but sitting in the restaurant is not cosy.",
          "We walked across this bridge in the day and walked back in the night to see it lit up. There is a cafe, restaurant and shop based on the middle of the bridge. Good photo opportunities. Very unusual",
          "This floating island in the Mur River must have been quite a technical challenge but frankly it seems rather meaningless. I though it was more satisfying to stand up on the street footpath and look down on the structure rather than to ride the elevator down and then step onto",
          "Along with the Kunsthaus (Contemporary art museum), this sci-fi bridge/restaurant/bar is striking out from Graz classicism. It's a great, modern pedestrian bridge, with a small amphitheater in the middle of Mur river. There's indoor and outdoor seating, and it was very relaxing",
          "You can't help but notice this stunning piece of modern architecture floating in the middle of the Mur river. It resembles a giant sea shell and it's quite cool. You can access the structure from bridges on either side of the river. Once there you can enjoy a drink or something",
          "Or what does it meant to be? The bridge are funny wobbly. The Mur Insel itself has a Caf\u00e9 downstairs and a very good sightseeing shop upstairs with local \"contemporary \" gifts. There is also as an outside seating.",
          "If you're going to cross the river anyway, you might as well cross on the Murinsel, a neat island that they built in the middle of the river. It's an interesting architectural structure, and there are some shops and a cafe open during the summer.",
          "Well it sits on the river, LOL! But seriously it is a modern contraption in the middle of an old city. While the shops are closed this time of the year it provides access from one side of the river to the other. It can be seen from the top of the hill overlooking the river.",
          "Seems its closed in winter, or at least when we visited Graz..they turn on a few lights at night and it looks neat over the river at night, but the walkway is closed off. During the day it looks a bit dreary and industrial..I'm sure its nicer in spring/summer",
          "In this beautiful medieval city, the island in the Mur was built in 2003. It should be jarring, out of place, clashing with the buildings that surround it, yet strangely it works. There is a cafe/bar where refreshments can be purchased, to be enjoyed while the Mur rushes by",
          "We went there for a coffee. Its very interesting and \"unusual thing\" to see. I liked the interior design, there's a smaller \"playground\" for children, all in all its something different too see, quite the opposite to old buildings around this atraction. I'd say its almost a must",
          "a very unique piece of architecture in the middle of the river through Graz. a place to meet on a warm sunny day.",
          "Very innovative, very \"outside the box\" and still so simple. It's at the center of Graz so you will for sure see it. Just walk through it, if you don't have time to stop for a coffee.",
          "Why did the city fathers allow the building of this awful structure in the middle of a pleasant river? It is awful. And when you walk onto the island there is nothing there.",
          "I went to Graz specifically to see Murinsel and Art Museum building with my own eyes. It was difficult to understand how those 2 modern constructions fit into baroque beauty of Graz everywhere. It fit very well. Murinsel is lit in the evenings and looks amazing.",
          "Extraordinary artificial island on the river Mur. Constructed in 2003, in the year Graz was Cultural City of Europe. Nice to walk over, to stay some time there and relax or to have some refreshment in the bar.",
          "Was not quite sure what this was at first, but then it revealed itself as a shell with walkways linking both sides of the river. Interesting piece of architecture! Cafe inside but no time as only had a couple of hours!",
          "In the touristic brochures it seems to be a very cool and vivid place. When you arrive to the bridge the only thing you realise that the whole place is sooo abandoned... neither the playground nor the caf\u00e9 were opened although we visited it in the late afternoon. The whole",
          "Visited out of curiosity, even meant to stop for a cup of coffee. The cafe outside was closed so we walked down the stairs, in doubt if we want to stay there. I took a photo and the waiter yelled at me not to take photos there! Since when have public places like cafes been",
          "This is certainly an unusual place - worth a visit for the position and design. I have visited twice for coffee and cake, nice if you don't count the scowling waiter. The other week we called in after dinner for a drink, it was busy upstairs with young people, music etc. so we",
          "its a glass and steel bridge on the river .. amazing..island between river and trees..you can sit and drink coffee with the sound of water..restfully.",
          "Every single person who visits Graz wants to go and picture the \"beautiful\" island. Shame they all get to find out that it doesen't look so beautiful, like in the pictures they've seen before coming to Graz",
          "Attraction is probably the wrong word for this as it is basically a floating bridge with a bar/restaurant in the middle. Worth going to see as there is lots to see by it and its quite impressive. The Mur river is worth a visit as well, very relaxing!",
          "We went with the intention to have a bite to eat. Ended up just having a drink because the place is so run down and the staff so lacking passion for what they do. Such a shame for what could be such a great location. A change of ownership is desperately needed to turn this",
          "Unfortunately we arrived on the island just as the restaurant was closing for the evening so can't speak to food, service, etc. It certainly an interesting structure and very picturesque. It looks to be an interesting venue to lunch on a sunny day or a dinner understars.",
          "Saw this when searching for things to do in Graz. It looked investing so we had a walk down to it. It's literally a metal sculpture with a cafe and toilet in the middle. I thought maybe a couple of market stalls or a gift shop world be there too, but no. It's a nice walk",
          "Four of us had a light lunch with beer here, and all were satisfied. The rucola salad was great. It's a great location, in the river.",
          "Its just fab , island in the middle of the river , free to walk across it , great views of the river , and the town , either way you can get a meal / drink there , but we just sat on the steps on a higher level enjoying the sun , and cool breeze from the river",
          "The place is interesting. But the waiter was unpleasant. The place was dirty, carbage around. Toilet was terrible.",
          "My wife and I got there by recommendation. Interesting place, but...I wanted to take a photo, the waiter ( bold guy with green glasses) unpleasantly told me not to (WHY?). A few minutes after he brought us coffee, he came to collect the money, also with a very unpleasant tone.",
          "It will for sure catch your eye walking over the bridges passing the main river in graz. So take a walk and have a coffy and cake or treat yourself with the night out. Interesting structure standing in the middle of the beautifull river is for sure one of the sights in Graz you",
          "I am only giving one star to write this review. I was showing my friend from abroad around and the waiter stopped us blocking the entrance to the cafe telling us to get lost if we are not planning on ordering something. He was extremely rude and unwelcoming.",
          "Nice and interesting island, impossible to miss if you are in graz. It is better to sit outside when the weather is warm...",
          "At first I had no idea what this was from a distance - it is a building designed to look like a floating shell in the middle of the river with curved walkways connecting it to either side. There is an elevator on one side for sure - not sure about the other side. There is an",
          "marvellous modern bridge and event space in the middle of a raging alpine river. Looks beautiful and works well in contrast with the traditional Styrian landscape and architecture",
          "Great atmosphere, you can just walk through murinsel or stop to drink something or eat ice-cream. Murinsel is in city center so it's easy to found and visit.",
          "It seemed interesting to stop by here for a coffee and warm up. It's certainly nothing like we've seen before but it's not that pretty once you get up-close. Inside is nice though, not many tables. I ordered hot chocolate with rum and it was the best aromatic rum I've ever",
          "This is a coffee shop and performance area. Wonderful place to chill out and relax. Variety of food and drinks. Be aware the coffee you get in Austria is not what you my expect but tastes great",
          "Much better to view from the next bridge to get a better view of the Murinsel, especially in the evening when its all light up",
          "Very unique, but if the river is flowing quickly it can be a bumpy ride, hopefully you don't suffer from sea sickness!",
          "We used this bridge to cross the river Mur. An interesting feature of it was a caf\u00e9 in the middle of it. It\u2019s got a sort of futuristic look and we saw even some photo session taking place there one morning.",
          "Built on 2003 an unusual landmark that sits in the water, like shell floating on the river, linked by footbridges to enter this cafe.",
          "An artificial island in the city center, interesting for modern architecture fans: probably it's famous just because of its \"being a strange attraction\"... There's a bar in the center.",
          "nice looking unusual island is easy to visit - just a few steps from the old town. There is bride from both river banks. It is nice to sit in a caffe or on open theater sits in a sunny day...",
          "This is one of the most unique structures we have ever visited. Who would think to build a structure like this in the middle of a river with ramps to it from either side of the river. In addition there is a caf\u00e9 on it as well as a small playground for small children. Parents can",
          "This is a floating pavilion in the middle of the Mur river. The architecture is interesting and unusual. There is also a cafe on the pavilion. Would be a nice view in the summer. But the coffee etc is overpriced.",
          "I have never seen anything quite like this before. A beautifully built island floating in the Mur and linked to both banks by walkways. It contains a cafe and an amphitheatre and is well worth a visit.",
          "I went to the mur with a friend. We found a wide range of cocktails which match everyone's taste. It was a bit darkat the end of the day but I guess it would be romantic for a couple.",
          "Normally bridges are helpful to change from one side of the river to the other, however - in Graz they have a different idea- and created an artificial island incl. Cafe in the middle of the Mur river. A very nice way to take a rest in the middle of the river. Not a big",
          "A small, futuristic walkway across the Mur - doesn't really fit into the Old Town architecture and that's the beauty of it. Worth taking a short walk with some pictures.",
          "We drove in from our hotel in Gossendorf and easily followed the signs to Murinsel. Be sure to check out the underground parking places as on street parking is expensive and one needs exact change. We parked at the Mariahilferkircke parking and Murinsel was right there. We",
          "There's not much to do on this small \"island\", but lat least it looks nice! Remember to take pictures from the bridge during the night time when it's lit. There's a cafe on Murinsel if you want a new kind of experience.",
          "This is the coolest thing I have ever seen in a river. The architecture is so interesting to look at. Having a drink while having water rush past you is oddly relaxing. There isn't much for meals but if you want a snack, drink or desert it's worth stopping by. There is a",
          "In the middle of the rapid Mura river was built this island from steel and glass. It was in 2003 as part of the European Cultural Capital project. They wanted just as a temporary institution, but peaople liked so much, that today it would be hard to move it away. There is a",
          "Murinsel is architectural wonder located on the river Mura. It's made Proclaiming the city of Graz for the European Capital of Culture. It was built so that it is not fixed for the coast, but it moves depending on the level and rate of flow of the river Mura. It is intended to",
          "https://500px.com/photo/94099251/murinsel-by-sorin-markus?from=user_library I took this photo from the next bridge over Mur river, by night.The building is a modern one, very trendy and contrasting with the old architecture of the city. The cofehouse is remarcable and the cofee",
          "I think it is an original idea to build such a floating platform on the river where people can have a coffee or a beer. I also like the design, it is unique. However, it is hard to believe that this place is not even 13 years old. It is rusty and grey, the windows need",
          "A great spot as it is like an island on the river and while you sit and enjoy a coffee or a drink, you can watch the river going by very fast. I found the service very poor, the waiter seemed friendly, but had no idea what he was doing and it took quite a while to get three",
          "I approached from Mariahilfer Platz to the Promenade & down the walkway to Murinsel with views of super autumn colours & the Mur River gushing over rapids. I did not stay at the Cafe as it was not yet open for the day. I continued to the old City side again with great views.",
          "Never even heard of the River Mur...quite a raging river where one can even find surfers. The Murinsel is a pod-like affair anchored in the middle of the Mur...walkable from both sides. We sat outside and enjoyed the cafe atmosphere. We had beer and wine. One can walk to",
          "Its was a good idea to place this extravagant steel construction into the river and make an island. Extraordinary & easily memorable.",
          "heard about the Murinsel lots as we had an Austrian professor at uni. 3rd time in graz and visited it for the first time and was disappointed by the service as the waitress seemed not to know what to do! yes, it was a busy day but its a sunny day and you're an outdoor tourist",
          "While I do try to find something possitive to say about even largely negative things, this one truly left me struggling. We passed through this \"Attraction\" as part of a self guided walking tour featured in a brochure we picked up at the tourist information office. I can",
          "My spouse and I are visited The Murinsel on 15/4/13. It is a very interesting concept. We recommend visiting for the views & architecture but give the cafe a miss as the service we received from the woman at the cafe was appallingly rude.",
          "A lovely bridge/ cafe/ art place in Graz. You virutally sit on the river bed. You should not miss it. Perfect for a sunny afternoon.",
          "It has never turned a profit for anyone. Everyone likes to pass through it (for free) to get from one side of the river to the other and/or look at it from the Hauptbr\u00fccke or riverbanks, but it was a waste of money that might better have been spent on other things some other",
          "This was installed for Graz's year as European Capital of Culture and it was interesting then. But now it seems a bit shabby and it is not a place I would hang around. Go through it, take photos etc, but do not waste money/time eating or drinking in it.",
          "This is the artificial Island made by an architect which incorporates an restaurant and is used as a stage for concerts. It is one of the dominants of the city and if you are here you can leave without a picture and a walk thru it. During the day it works like a normal",

          "The Murinsel itself is a very interesting piece of architecture worth visiting, if only to marvel at the curiosity of it. We have also tried the caf\u00e9, which was okay, even though no pastries were on the menu and the coffee was a bit overpriced (4,50 for iced coffee). The"

          "Standing within a public building in the old town of Graz and with free access, on the left side of the road from the Cathedral. The stairs split and rejoin several times as they circle upward to the top. Me and my son went separate ways and ultimately reunited. Very interesting",
          "While you won't be here long there is no reason not to visit. It's a really interesting piece that you can pop into and climb up. Does exactly what it says on the tin. Keep in mind it is a little hidden away so ask someone if you need point in the right direction.",
          "Was great to see and got some interesting photos. Amazing staircase design. It\u2019s free to enter and suggest doing a selfie on the second set of stairs up by placing your phone on the balustrade post.",
          "Interesting \u201c staircase \u201c leading to the top of a building . Romantic to kiss at the top after each person went up a different side . Very cleverly done",
          "go up and down, one and the other stair, see up and down and take pictures of the beautiful views of the stairs.",
          "The castle in Graz is the headquarters of the state government and a real jewel. It has been structurally changed for centuries, offering interesting elements of Gothic, Renaissance and Bidermeier. Especially the twin spiral staircase, which initially looks like an optical",
          "It is maybe the only staircase which is so built. Two staircases are together in a very interesting way. It is from the middle age.",
          "Worth a quick look/climb. Old staircase. Visited in the evening and couldn\u00b4t get through the closed door at the top of the stairs.",
          "We entered the grounds of the Castle, built during the 15th century, it was refurbished several times during the following centuries. Particularly interesting is the double spiral staircase built at the end of the 15th century which granted a nice view of the cathedral.",
          "This was the first stop on our walking tour of the city. It was such an interesting highlight of the tour, I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. It doesn\u2019t take long to climb to the top and look down. Such a fun experience!",
          "It is spectacular and amazing how this was built 500 years ago. That said it will take you max 10 min to walk to the top and down again. But it\u2019s free! And close to the Dom and the Mausoleum so why not spend those extra minutes. The Burg where it is situated is nice as well. In",
          "If you can find it this is a very interesting construction but will only occupy you for about 10mins. It is free to see and very unique and I would definitely suggest seeing it if you are close by but do not make a special trip unless you are in to staircases!",
          "Take the time to see this amazing structure that was built in the middle 1600. Hope you can avoid the large crowds. See this marvel when they are gone.",
          "This was a real fun find and so unusual too. The spirals wind up in both directions and meet in three places taking you to the top of the building. This staircase was originally part of Graz castle which was demolished, but some bits still survive. A little hard to find, but",
          "According to our walking tour guide, this is sometimes referred to as the lover's staircase because two people climbing from separate steps will keep meeting over and over. Come visit with another person to make it easier to figure out what's going on.",
          "tucked inside the square, you find this hidden gem. please! don't have drinks before visiting this unique structure. i don't want to say too much. JUST go!",
          "Approximately less than 100 steps to the top with the two sides. They are merged in three places. I recommend a visit with couples.",
          "These stairs are straight out of a fairy tale movie. They are tucked away in the courtyard of the Grazer Burg. Built for Emperor Maximilian I around 1500, they are a blast to walk up, but alas they don't go anywhere at the top so you just come back down. We learned another day",
          "When you arrive at the top, you are required to pay 4EU each for the pleasure! The view is fine, but Graz does not have a lot of memorable buildings to see from this vantage point. I would not consider doing this on a windy or rainy day.",
          "We were told by our friend who lives in Graz that we should stop at Doppelwendeltreppe and we are glad we did ! We had a good map and it was not hard to find! The double staircase is intriguing!",
          "Hidden away, but a definite must see in Graz. Great to walk up and down. Seek it out for some exercise!",
          "Nice to stop by here and have a mesmerizing walk over the double spiral staircase. You can both chose a side and meet up in the middle every time. Very much fun",
          "After a little bit of detective work to find, mainly due to a poor map and reader, worth a visit on a walking tour of Graz. Interesting to climb and look down. Could be a little congested in busy periods. Something different yo see.",
          "Just find it at the end of Hofstrasse just before the park. No fee - walk it up and then down and get your photos. A small gem during your strol in Graz.",
          "Dropped there by chance. They're situated across the main Cathedral, the Domkirche, in the Palace courtyard. It's an ordinary stone staircase you've probably climbed in many towers, belfries,....but x2. There are two staircases next to each other and they meet on each floor."

        "wiki": "The Universalmuseum Joanneum is a multidisciplinary museum with buildings in several locations in the province of Styria, Austria. It has galleries and collections in many subject areas including archaeology, geology, paleontology, mineralogy, botany, zoology, history, art and folk culture. It is the oldest museum in Austria as well as the largest universal museum in central Europe with over 4.5 million objects in 13 departments and 12 locations in the Styrian cities of Graz, Stainz, Trautenfels, and Wagna (Flavia Solva). To reflect this status and its growth over the last two centuries, as well as to present a more recognizable image internationally, the Landesmuseum Joanneum was officially renamed to Universalmuseum Joanneum on 10 September 2009.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Landesmuseum Joanneum was established in 1811 by Archduke Johann. It was Austria's first museum as well as a center for continuing education and scientific research. Notably, the Coin Cabinet and the mineralogical collection were extensive, private collections belonging to the archduke. They form the heart of the museum's departments in disciplines from both the humanities and the natural sciences. Around this core of collections, some of the best scientists of the era taught and conducted research: Friedrich Mohs developed the Mohs scale of mineral hardness there and Franz Unger, a pioneer in paleobotany, plant physiology, phytotomy and soil science, taught here. In 1864, the Joanneum entered the ranks of the \"k.k. technical colleges\".Following the decision to raise the institution into the ranks of imperial colleges, as well as for organizational reasons and the need for more space, the institution was split in 1887. The college became the Graz University of Technology, and the collections of the Joanneum, both scientific and cultural-historical, were combined into the Landesmuseum Joanneum.\nThe Joanneum show collections occurred in the \"Lesliehof\" along the Raubergasse in Graz just off the main square. However, the collections soon outgrew the confines of the residence. A new museum building was erected between 1890 and 1895, along the Neutorgasse in Graz directly behind the Lesliehof. This building, designed in the neobaroque style by August Gunold, became the \u201cNew Joanneum\u201d. Beginning in 2009, both buildings, as well as the open ground between them, underwent extensive renovation and construction. A new, central, underground entrance and three-story, underground depot adjoining both buildings and the Styrian Provincial Library, which was also part of the original 1811 Joanneum, was constructed creating. During the Joanneum's bicentennial in 2011, in the renovated Neutorgasse building, the Neue Galerie art museum and the multimedia collection opened. Thereafter the Museum of Nature and Science enjoyed a redesign in its original, albeit renovated, location in the Lesliehof.\nUntil 2003, the Joanneum was governed by the Styrian regional government. In 2003, coinciding with the designation of Graz as the sole European Capital of Culture for that year, the Joanneum was spun off into a GmbH (Limited Liability Company). While the Joanneum gained some autonomy in business, marketing and budgetary decision-making with this move, the Province of Styria remains the successor of Archduke Johann and retains all ownership and property rights to the buildings and collections.\nThe museum is the largest of its kind in central Europe and second only to the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna in size for Austrian museums in general. The Joanneum employs an international team of about 500 people across fields from visitor services to acquisitions, conservation and preservation to scientific research. The more than 4.5 million objects among the various collections as well as historical buildings and locations form the basis of a multifaceted exhibition program. Steeped in tradition, the Joanneum collects, preserves, conserves, researches and conveys a broad spectrum of information dealing with the nature, history, culture and art of Styria in an international context with an eye towards the future.\n\n\n== Locations and collections ==\n\n\n=== Graz ===\n\n\n==== Styrian Armory ====\nThe Landeszeughaus originally was the central weapons depot of the Duchy of Styria during the Ottoman Wars. It is the only remaining armory of its type in the world. The installation remained largely unchanged for nearly 400 years and provides the atmosphere of an authentic armory of the 17th century. 32,000 exhibits are housed in the collection; suits of armor, coats of mail, helmets, melee weapons, firearms and other engines of war. The military history of Styria is illustrated with its own exhibition in the cannon hall.\n\n\n==== Folkloristic Museum ====\nThe Volkskundemuseum houses the oldest and most extensive collection of folkloristic and folk culture objects in Styria. It was opened in 1913, and is located in a former Capuchin cloister just inside Graz's only remaining Renaissance city-gate, the Paulustor (St. Paul's Gate), erected under Ferdinand II. The library of folklore contains over 14,000 individual volumes as well as an archive of original material and over 20,000 slides and historic photographs documenting the life of rural Styria. The exhibits offer insights into the rural culture and lifestyle of pre-industrial Styria. The collection emphasizes the life, fashion and beliefs of the Styrian people,  showing the social and cultural relations between the person and the objects left behind. Specific features of the collection are the original smoking room and the tracht hall. The complex also includes the Antoniuskirche (Church of St. Anthony) with original paintings by Giovanni Pietro de Pomis and Hans Adam Weissenkircher where the traditional \"Styrian Shepherds' and Nativity Songs\" are presented annually along with new compositions by local composers.\n\n\n==== Museum im Palais ====\nThe Styrian Treasury holds the cultural history collection of the Joanneum and encompasses around 35,000 objects from all areas of the aesthetically informed way of life \u2013 from the Middle Ages up to the present-day: They bear witness to Styrian history and offer examples of life among Styrian royalty and nobility as well as the domestic life of the aristocracy and middle-class; artisans' crafts in metal, wood, ivory, ceramic, glass and textiles as well as collections of wrought iron objects, tracht and musical instruments are presented. The Styrian ducal hat, the magnificent coach of Emperor Frederick III and a stone coat of arms from the Graz Castle count among the most significant objects in the collection. To coincide with the Joanneum's bicentennial year, the cultural history collection opened the Museum im Palais in Summer 2011 in the former Herberstein city palace along the Grazer Sackstrasse and presents a newly designed permanent exhibition complemented by special exhibitions.\nThe Museum im Palais is housed in the former Palais Herberstein and, in addition to the show collection and temporary exhibitions, also opens the Baroque staterooms to visitors. The Palais Herberstein was originally renovated into a Baroque city palace for the Princes of Eggenberg by Austrian architect Joseph Hueber. The palace passed into the possession of a branch of the Herberstein family in 1774 after the extinction of the male line of Eggenberg heirs.\n\n\n==== Joanneum Quarter ====\nThe Joanneum Quarter (German: Joanneumsviertel) includes the original Joanneum building on the Raubergasse as well as the Neutorgasse building and the Styrian Provincial Library. A grand entrance provides access to all three buildings. A three story deep, subterranean depot for the library's collections between the three buildings.\n\n\n===== Neue Galerie =====\nThe Neue Galerie Graz originated in 1941 with the division of the Provincial Art Gallery founded in 1811 as part of the Joanneum into the Alte Galerie\u2013comprising Medieval to Baroque artworks up to 1800\u2013and the Neue Galerie Graz\u2013comprising works beginning with Neoclassicism, Romanticism, Realism and Modern art. The museum has an extensive collection of pedagogic art from the 19th and 20th centuries featuring works by Austrian artists including Ferdinand Georg Waldm\u00fcller, Egon Schiele, Gustav Klimt, Maria Lassnig and Arnulf Rainer as well as international artists such as Marcel Duchamp, Robert Rauschenberg and Fred Sandback. The gallery focuses on procuring and exhibiting an ever-growing collection of contemporary art.\nThe Neue Galerie Graz houses an extensive collection of some 40,000 graphics as well as photographs, film and video collections. Like the K\u00fcnstlerhaus Graz and the KHG, the Neue Galerie Graz provides a venue for contemporary artists, both local and international, with a variety of temporary exhibitions. Among these contemporary artists, controversial Styrian artist G\u00fcnter Brus was to have his own permanent exhibition space, called the Bruseum, in the newly renovated \"Neutorgasse\" building in the Joanneum Quarter.\n\n\n===== Multimedia collections =====\nThe multimedia collections (formerly known as the Picture and Tone Archives) were established in 1960 to collect photographic, film and audio material relating to Styria for research and educational purposes and to make these materials available to the general public. The collection presently consists of more than 2.5 million photographs, tens of thousands of audio recordings and thousands of films that document the development of the Bundesland of Styria from the dawn of the era of photography, film and audio recording.\n\n\n===== Museum of nature and science =====\nIn 2009 the scientific departments of the Joanneum moved to the Center for Natural History in the Andritz district of Graz. This center cares for the collections and continues scientific research with contemporary means. Steeped in tradition, these departments form the core of the original Joanneum established by Archduke Johann. It offers interdisciplinary exhibitions of botany, zoology, geology and paleontology, and mineralogy.\nCoSA - Center of Science Activities\nThe Center of Science Activities (CoSA) is a science center in the natural history museum of the Graz Joanneumsviertel, in which technology and natural sciences are taught in a low-threshold way. It was opened in 2019 after a four-year planning phase as a joint project of the Graz Children's Museum FRida & freD and the Universalmuseum Joanneum. A worldwide unique feature of the CoSA is the combination of storytelling, augmented reality and gamification for knowledge transfer in the museum sector.\n\n\n====== Botany ======\nFerns, flowering plants, mushrooms and mosses\u2013dried, pressed, stretched and packed in paper capsules. The core of the botanical collection consists of more than half a million well-preserved plants. Special collections of fruits and seeds as well as models of fruits and an extensive xylotheque (library of woods) complement the herbarium, which shows a comprehensive archive of Styrian flora and the base for research projects on local vegetation. Franz Unger did some of his early teaching and research in this department while he resided in Graz.\n\n\n====== Zoology ======\nThe collection encompasses about 850,000 specimens typical of their respective habitats. Vertebrates take up the largest portion of the collection. Examples from other regions\u2014from the seashores to the original fauna of Australia\u2014round-out the collection inventory. The primary focuses of the scientific collections are, among other things, insects and mollusks among the invertebrate animals as well as skeletons and bird's eggs among the vertebrates.\n\n\n====== Geology and paleontology ======\n500 million years Styrian history are gathered here: Fossilized remains of earlier living beings reveal information about ice ages, tropical seas, ancient forests and marshes. Beside the mammoths and mastodons, the cave bears and the giant deer, corals, mussels and fish are found among the core specimens of the collection. Since 1998 the department of Geology and Paleontology has organized fossil digs with schools.\n\n\n====== Mineralogy ======\nAs with the coin cabinet collection, the mineralogical collection traces its origin to the private collection of Archduke Johann, which encompassed several thousand pieces at that time. Today the inventory has grown to about 80,000 specimens. The collection presents minerals from across the world as well as a Styrian regional collection. The mineralogy department of the Joanneum was where Friedrich Mohs developed the Mohs scale of mineral hardness which remains authoritative. He was the first curator of the Joanneum.\n\n\n==== Schloss Eggenberg ====\n\n\n===== Staterooms and gardens =====\nSchloss Eggenberg was added to the registry of the Graz Old Town as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2010. Schloss Eggenberg is the most significant palace ensemble in Styria and is surrounded by an extensive, scenic garden. The palace, designed by court architect Giovanni Pietro de Pomis, according to the inspiration of the Spanish El Escorial, is both an opulent residence intended to convey the wealth, might and status of owner-builder Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg as well as a complex allegory of the cosmos. Central to the multifaceted conception are an ensemble of historic interior rooms. The cycle of 24 staterooms with original accouterments and period furnishings from the 17th and 18th centuries counts among the most significant ensembles of historic interiors in Austria. The climax of this piano nobile is the Planetary Room, which owes its name to the cycle of ceiling and wall paintings (completed in 1685) that adorn it, by court painter Hans Adam Weissenkircher. His elegant melding of astrological and hermetic images, numerology and family mythology into a complicated allegory of the \"Golden Age\" of the House of Eggenberg is counted among the most important and impressive systems of early Baroque room-art in Central Europe.\nNine hectares of gardens, mostly overgrown and lost through decades of neglect by the end of World War II, were restored or reconstructed as a living monument to Romanticism and bear the influence of the last gardener to own the palace, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Count Herberstein. In the early 19th century, Count Herberstein had the palace grounds transformed into a picturesque English garden.\n\n\n===== Alte Galerie =====\n\nThe collections of the Alte Galerie Graz contain works by old masters of European art from the Middle Ages through the 18th century. The 22-room show collection in Schloss Eggenberg follows a thematic design by subject matter. Objects of Romanesque art such as the \"St. Nicholas Sacristy Door\", Gothic art including the St. Lambrecht Votive Altarpiece, the world-renowned \"Admont Madonna\" and the \"Death Portrait of Maximilian I\" or a portrait of his first wife Mary, Duchess of Burgundy and the Greater and Lesser Miracle Altars of Mariazell are among the collection of medieval art. Beginning with the Renaissance and going through Mannerism to the late Baroque, works by Lucas Cranach the Elder, Dosso Dossi, Sofonisba Anguissola, Bartholomeus Spranger, Pieter Brueghel the Younger, Martin Johann Schmidt and Angelica Kauffman are on display in the early modern period collection. The inventory of the printroom of the Alte Galerie Graz is extensive and contains hand drawings and print graphics from 1500 till the end of the 18th century. Among these are extensive works by Rembrandt, Albrecht D\u00fcrer and Giambattista Piranesi.\n\n\n===== Coin cabinet =====\nThe Coin Cabinet also traces its origin to the private collection of Archduke Johann. With over 70,000 objects, it is currently the second largest, public coin collection in Austria. Through a combination of state-of-the-art technology and historical items, the coins, currency and equipment related to minting trace the history of regional coin circulation and minting from the prehistoric era to the eurozone. Among the most significant pieces are coins from finds in and around Styria that were in circulation at the time of the Roman Empire. Additionally, Friesacher and Grazer Pfennigs from the Middle Ages and coins and medallions from the Inner Austrian mints in Graz, Klagenfurt and St. Veit an der Glan as well as from other lands of the Austro-Hungarian Empire are on display. The collection traces the history of coin mintage and names from around the world with prehistoric Celtic coins from the region, shells, early forms of paper currency and the euro in addition to international coins of historic significance minted in Africa, the US, and by the Dutch East India Company among others. The permanent collection, with an additional room for temporary exhibitions, is fittingly situated in the oldest portion of palace dating to the late Middle Ages and once belonging to Balthasar Eggenberger, mint master and financier to Emperor Frederick III in the early days of Mercantilism.\n\n\n===== Archaeology Museum and Lapidarium =====\nThe Archaeology museum and lapidarium is Located adjacent to the Planetary Garden and Lapidarium at Schloss Eggenberg. It hosts an array of over 1200 objects from past social environments. The second largest archaeological collection of Austria unites evidence of human existence from \"Styrian\" prehistory with findings from Classical Antiquity, the Ancient Near East and Ancient Egypt. A unique attraction is the Cult Wagon of Strettweg, found among grave goods from the Hallstatt culture.It  underwent an extensive restoration. One of the most significant Roman stonemasonry collections of the eastern Alps is in the adjacent Lapidarium: 96 stones, including gravestones, monuments, medallions and round sculptures, three large remnants of mosaic floors as well as a prominent exhibit, the nearly three meter high grave stele of L. Cantius.Akin to the archaeology museum is the Roman Museum of Flavia Solva near the southern Styrian town of Wagna. (see below)\n\n\n===== Museumsakademie Joanneum =====\nThe Museumsakademie Joanneum encourages further education, training and research in museology, museum planning, interpretive planning, exhibit design and museum management..It is headquartered in one of the Eggenberg garden houses and works with an international network of museums and local institutions including the University of Graz and the Graz University of Technology, It provides a platform and resources for discussions with international researchers in museology and museological theory in order to promote the continuing development of both the Joanneum and of museological practices and research around the world.\n\n\n==== Exhibition houses ====\n\n\n===== K\u00fcnstlerhaus Graz =====\nOpening in 1952, the K\u00fcnstlerhaus Graz (Artists' House) has served for six decades as a venue for promoting contemporary artists from Styria. It is located between the Grazer Old Town and the University Quarter just outside Graz's only remaining Gothic city gate, the \"Burgtor\" (Castle Gate). It was erected under Frederick III, H.R.R.  K\u00fcnstlerhaus Graz provides a space for contemporary artists from in and around Styria to engage the public with their work. As part of the preparations for the city of Graz's tenure as the 2003 European Capital of Culture it was integrated into the Universalmuseum Joanneum and continues to serve this function.\n\n\n===== Kunsthaus Graz =====\nKunsthaus Graz presents architecture, design, new media, CGI, film and photography under one roof. The \"facility was dubbed \"Friendly Alien\" by its designers Peter Cook and Colin Fournier. It offers spectacular architecture and exhibitions by international, contemporary artists from the late 20th century onwards. A special highlight of this blob architecture building is the \"Needle\": a glass viewing platform that looks out across the Mur River towards the Graz city center and the Grazer Schlossberg. The BIX fa\u00e7ade on the eastern (Mur) face of the KHG serves as an \"urban screen\" with 925 programmable fluorescent lamps that display messages and moving patterns of light on the surroundings.\n\n\n==== Austrian Sculpture Park ====\nMore than 60 sculptures are embedded in a seven-hectare park with rose mounds, lotus blossom ponds and labyrinths on the southern outskirts of Graz. Since its founding in 2003, the Austrian Sculpture Park offers visitors a scenic overview of\u2014mainly Austrian, but also international\u2014contemporary sculpture and sculptural art as well as the rolling gardens of Swiss landscape architect Dieter Kienast. In 2008 the collection was extended by the donation of the Painting to Hammer a Nail in / Cross Version by artist Yoko Ono.\n\n\n=== Throughout Styria ===\n\n\n==== Roman Museum ====\nFlavia Solva is the most significant Roman era find in modern-day Styria. It is located near a hill on the edge of the town of Wagna, overlooking the Mur River. The town developed near an existing settlement of Celts centered on the nearby hill, the Frauenberg near Leibnitz. It gained full status as a Roman city by grant of a municipal charter by Vespasian in 70 AD. The settlement expanded and the Celtic populations adopted Roman ways and technology. It offers a viewing platform and showroom built overlooking excavated Roman ruins. This museum offers visitors a glimpse into the everyday life, worship, and death cults of what was once the most cultured town of the Roman province of Noricum.\n\n\n==== Schloss Trautenfels ====\nThe Baroque palace of Schloss Trautenfels is situated at the foot of the Grimming on a protruding cliff in the municipality P\u00fcrgg-Trautenfels. In the Middle Ages the cliff protrusion held a small damn on the Enns River until the 16th century. In 1664 the area was bought by the Styrian provincial governor, Count Siegmund Friedrich von Trauttmansdorff and subsequently converted and expanded by him into an early Baroque residence that bears his name. The staterooms feature both Renaissance and Baroque frescoes and paintings as well as the Antler Room of the Counts of Lemberg, and the stunning Marble Hall all of which are open to visitors.\n\n\n===== Regional Landscape and Folkloristic Museum =====\nBeginning in the 1950s a concerted effort was made to collect objects relating to the natural and cultural history of the Ennstal region of Upper Styria and the Styrian Salzkammergut. Both the splendor of the landscape and the palace itself are on display. Objects of geological interest as well as the rural domestic life of the region are on display. The exhibition also displays exhibits recollecting the historic transitions and their impact on the people, such as the Reformation and Counter-Reformation. The permanent show collection presents about 1000 exhibits relating to both the land and the people over the course of history in of the Ennstal Valley as well as the Ausseerland from the Middle Ages to the early modern era.\n\n\n==== Schloss Stainz ====\nSchloss Stainz is a former Augustinian Canons Regular monastery purchased by Archduke Johann in 1840 and remains in the estate of his heirs, the Counts of Meran. Various rooms, terraces and arcades are available to rent for private functions. The former monastery houses two collections:\n\n\n===== Hunting Museum =====\nThe design of this exhibition treats the hunt as a historical, sociological and philosophical-ethical phenomenon. It offers the visitor a chance to examine the connections of hunting, ecology and nature. The interdisciplinary approach to this exhibition combines Baroque animal trophies, historical tools and weapons, paintings and artwork with state-of-the-art technology and museum design to illustrate the development of the hunt from the Stone Age through Roman times up to the time of nobles and the early days of the middle-class.\n\n\n===== Agriculture Museum =====\nThe main focus of the agriculture collection is to show the rural farming, husbandry and forestry techniques prior to industrialization as well as the implements and photographic evidence relating to these practices. Original room furnishings from the 17th and 18th centuries provide a view into the different dimensions of rural life in Styria. The open areas hold a smithy, a cabbage pit, herb garden, an orchard and a small field to demonstrate various aspects of this pre-industrial, rural lifestyle.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nVan Uffelen, Chris.

        "wiki": "The Baroque Mariatrost Basilica on top of the Purberg hill in Mariatrost, a district of Graz, is one of the most famous pilgrimage sites of Styria in Austria.The pilgrimage church stands prominently on top of the Purberg hill (469 m) in the northeast of Graz. It can be reached using the 200 or more steps of the Angelus stair. The basilica is classified as a Baroque building. Two front towers (61 m) and a dome, visible from a great distance, are the characteristic attributes of the church, which is enclosed by two projecting wings of a former monastery once occupied by the Pauline Fathers (1708\u201386) and later by the Franciscans (1842\u20131996).The building was begun in 1714 by Andreas Stengg and his son Johann Georg Stengg and finished in 1724. The pulpit by Veit K\u00f6niger (1730/31) is the masterpiece of the furnishings. The frescoes on the ceiling by Lukas von Schram and Johann Baptist Scheidt are of particular importance.The main altar includes a statue of the Madonna originally created in the Gothic period around 1465, but altered to the Baroque style in 1695 by Bernhard Echter.On 28 October 1999 the church was nominated as a basilica minor.The Mariatrost Basilica is the second most important Marian shrine of Styria after Mariazell Basilica.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Mariatrost Basilica at Wikimedia Commons\nMariatrost Basilica at Graz tourist information server\nHomepage of the Mariatrost district (in German)\nGraz-Mariatrost parish (in German)",

        "wiki": "The Herz-Jesu-Kirche (English: Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus) is the largest church in Graz, Austria. It was designed down to the last detail by architect Georg Hauberrisser and constructed from 1881 to 1887.\nThe church was designed in the Neogothic style, with a large, high nave and under-church. The tower is 109.6 meters tall, making it the third-highest church tower in Austria. Of special note are the stained glass windows, which are among the few extant examples in Austria of Neogothic stained glass.\nThe altar area was remodelled in 1988 by Gustav Troger, just after the centenary of the church. Apart from that, everything is still according to the architect's concept.\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Herz-Jesu-Kirche at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nWagner, Anselm; Walk, Sophia (2019).

          "I have been living in Graz for 15 months now and only now I managed to visit this church. It is beautiful and certainly in my list for some time! We reached it during a First Communion messe and we totaly loved it! The building itself is gorgeous, the statues, the paintings,",

          "This is one of the most magestical church's I have ever been to. It's stunning in the middle of Graz with a grassy area outside where you can soak up the sun in fine weather. There was no one there when we visited and with our guide, we made our way up to the tower for the bell",
          "Biggest Church I have seen in Graz city.. Asked for a souvenir like this but they didnt have any.. must visit",

        "wiki": "Graz ( GRAHTS, German: [\u0261\u0281a\u02d0ts] (listen); Slovene: Gradec) is the capital city of Styria and Austria's second-largest city after Vienna. As of 1 January 2019, Graz had a population of 328,276 (292,269 of whom had principal-residence status). In 2015, the population of the Graz larger urban zone (LUZ) stood at 633,168, based on principal-residence status. Graz has a long tradition as a seat of higher education. It has four colleges and four universities with more than 60,000 students. Its historic centre  (Altstadt) is one of the best-preserved city centres in Central Europe.For centuries, Graz was more important to Slovenes and Croats, both politically and culturally, than the capitals of Ljubljana, Slovenia and Zagreb, Croatia; it remains influential to this day. In 1999, the city's historic centre was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites and in 2010 the designation was expanded to include Eggenberg Palace (German: Schloss Eggenberg) on the western edge of the city. Graz was designated the Cultural Capital of Europe in 2003 and became a City of Culinary Delights in 2008.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name of the city, Graz, formerly spelled Gratz, most likely stems from the Slavic gradec, which means \"small castle\". Some archaeological finds point to the erection of a small castle by Alpine Slavic people, which over time became a heavily defended fortification. In literary Slovene and Croatian, gradec still means \"small castle\", forming a hypocoristic derivative of Proto-West-South Slavic *grad\u044cc\u044a, whichs descends via liquid metathesis from Common Slavic *gard\u044cc\u044a and via the Slavic third palatalisation from Proto-Slavic *gardiku, originally denoting \"small town, settlement\". The name thus follows the common South Slavic pattern for naming settlements as grad. The German name 'Graz' first appears in records in 1128.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGraz is situated on both sides of the Mur river in southeast Austria. It is about 200 km (120 mi) southwest of Vienna (Wien). The nearest larger urban centre is Maribor (Marburg) in Slovenia, which is about 50 km (31 mi) to the south. Graz is the state capital and largest city in Styria, a green and heavily forested region on the eastern edge of the Alps.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring municipalities ===\nThese towns and villages border Graz:\n\nto the north: Gratkorn, Stattegg, Weinitzen\nto the east: Kainbach bei Graz, Hart bei Graz, Raaba\nto the south: G\u00f6ssendorf, Feldkirchen bei Graz, Seiersberg\nto the west: Attendorf, Thal, Judendorf-Stra\u00dfengel\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nGraz is divided into 17 municipal districts (Stadtbezirke):\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement on the ground of the modern city of Graz dates back to the Copper Age. However, no historical continuity exists of a settlement before the Middle Ages.\nDuring the 12th century, dukes under Babenberg rule made the town into an important commercial center. Later, Graz came under the rule of the Habsburgs and, in 1281, gained special privileges from King Rudolph I.\nIn the 14th century, Graz became the city of residence of the Inner Austrian line of the Habsburgs. The royalty lived in the Schlossberg castle and from there ruled Styria, Carinthia, most of today's Slovenia, and parts of Italy (Carniola, Gorizia and Gradisca, Trieste).\nIn the 16th century, the city's design and planning were primarily controlled by Italian Renaissance architects and artists. One of the most famous buildings representative of this style is the Landhaus, designed by Domenico dell'Allio, and used by the local rulers as a governmental headquarters.\n\nThe University of Graz was founded by Archduke Karl II in 1585, it's the city's oldest university. For most of its existence, it was controlled by the Catholic church, and was closed in 1782 by Joseph II in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a lyceum where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-established as a university by Emperor Franz I, and was named 'Karl-Franzens Universit\u00e4t' or 'Charles-Francis University' in English. More than 30,000 students are currently enrolled at this university.\nThe astronomer Johannes Kepler lived in Graz for a short period. He worked as a math teacher and was a professor of mathematics at the University of Graz, but still found time to study astronomy. He left Graz for Prague when Lutherans were banned from the city.\nLudwig Boltzmann was Professor for Mathematical Physics from 1869 to 1890. During that time, Nikola Tesla studied electrical engineering at the Polytechnic in 1875. Nobel Laureate Otto Loewi taught at the University of Graz from 1909 until 1938. Ivo Andric, the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature Laureate obtained his doctorate at the University of Graz. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger was briefly chancellor of the University of Graz in 1936.\nGraz is centrally located within today's Bundesland (state) of Styria, or Steiermark in German. Mark is an old German word indicating a large area of land used as a defensive border, in which the peasantry is taught how to organize and fight in the case of an invasion. With a strategic location at the head of the open and fertile Mur valley, Graz was historically a target of invaders, such as the Hungarians under Matthias Corvinus in 1481, and the Ottoman Turks in 1529 and 1532. Apart from the Riegersburg Castle, the Schlossberg was the only fortification in the region that never fell to the Ottoman Turks. Graz is home to the region's provincial armory, which is the world's largest historical collection of late medieval and Renaissance weaponry. It has been preserved since 1551, and displays over 30,000 items.\nFrom the earlier part of the 15th century, Graz was the residence of the younger branch of the Habsburgs, which succeeded to the imperial throne in 1619 in the person of Emperor Ferdinand II, who moved the capital to Vienna. New fortifications were built on the Schlossberg at the end of the 16th century. Napoleon's army occupied Graz in 1797. In 1809, the city withstood another assault by the French army. During this attack, the commanding officer in the fortress was ordered to defend it with about 900 men against Napoleon's army of about 3,000. He successfully defended the Schlossberg against eight attacks, but they were forced to give up after the Grande Arm\u00e9e occupied Vienna and the Emperor ordered to surrender. Following the defeat of Austria by Napoleonic forces at the Battle of Wagram in 1809, the fortifications were demolished using explosives, as stipulated in the Peace of Sch\u00f6nbrunn of the same year. The belltower (Glockenturm) and the civic clock tower (Uhrturm), which is a leading tourist attraction and serves as a symbol for Graz, were spared after the citizens of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation.Archduke Karl II of Inner Austria had 20,000 Protestant books burned in the square of what is now a mental hospital, and succeeded in returning Styria to the authority of the Holy See. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was born in Graz in what is now the Stadtmuseum (city museum).\n\n\n== Population development ==\nThe more recent population figures do not give the whole picture as only people with principal-residence status are counted and people with secondary residence status are not. Most of the people with secondary residence status in Graz are students. At the end of 2016 there were 33,473 people with secondary residence status in Graz.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nOceanic climate is the type found in the city, but due to the 0 \u00b0C isotherm, the same occurs in a humid continental climate with based in K\u00f6ppen system (Cfb/Dfb borderline). Wladimir K\u00f6ppen himself was in town and conducted studies to see how the climate of the past influenced the Continental Drift theory. Due to its position southeast of the Alps, Graz is shielded from the prevailing westerly winds that bring weather fronts in from the North Atlantic to northwestern and central Europe. The weather in Graz is thus influenced by the Mediterranean, and it has more hours of sunshine per year than Vienna or Salzburg and also less wind or rain. Graz lies in a basin that is only open to the south, causing the climate to be warmer than would be expected at that latitude. Plants are found in Graz that normally grow much further south.\n\naverage temperatures: Graz Airport 8.7 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) / Karl-Franzens University 9.4 \u00b0C (49 \u00b0F)\naverage rainfall: 818 mm (32 in) with on average 92 days of rain (Karl Franzens University)\naverage hours of sunshine: 1,989 (Karl Franzens University)\n\n\n== Slovenes and Graz ==\nPolitically, culturally, scientifically and religiously, Graz was an important centre for all Slovenes, especially from the establishment of the University of Graz in 1586 until the establishment of University of Ljubljana in 1919. In 1574, the first Slovene Catholic book was published in Graz, and in 1592, Hieronymus Megiser published in Graz the book Dictionarium quatuor linguarum, the first multilingual dictionary of Slovene.The Styrian Slovenes did not consider Graz a German-speaking city, but their own, a place to study while living at their relatives' homes and to fulfill one's career ambitions. The student associations in Graz were a crucible of the Slovene identity, and the Slovene students in Graz were more nationally aware than some others. This led to fierce anti-Slovene efforts of German-speaking nationalists in Graz before and during World War II.Many Slovenian Styrians study there. Slovenes are among the professors at the Institute for Jazz in Graz. Numerous Slovenes have found employment there, while being formerly unemployed in Slovenia. For the Slovene culture, Graz remains permanently important due to its university and the Universalmuseum Joanneum archives containing numerous documents from the Slovenian Styria.A symposium on the relation of Graz and the Slovenes was held in Graz in 2010, at the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the first and oldest chair of Slovene. It was established at the Lyzeum of Graz in July 1811 on the initiative of Janez Nepomuk Primic. A collection of lectures on the topic was published. The Slovenian Post commemorated the anniversary with a stamp.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nFor the year that Graz was Cultural Capital of Europe, new structures were erected. The Graz Museum of Contemporary Art (German: Kunsthaus) was designed by Peter Cook and Colin Fournier and is situated next to the Mur river. The Island in the Mur is a floating platform made of steel. It was designed by American architect Vito Acconci and contains a caf\u00e9, an open-air theatre and a playground.\n\n\n=== Historic city centre ===\n\nThe historic centre was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999 due to the harmonious co-existence of typical buildings from different epochs and in different architectural styles. Situated in a cultural borderland between Central Europe, Italy and the Balkan States, Graz absorbed various influences from the neighbouring regions and thus received its exceptional townscape. Today the historic centre consists of over 1,000 buildings, their age ranging from Gothic to contemporary.\nThe most important sights in the historic centre are:\n\nTown Hall (Rathaus).\nThe Castle hill (German: Schlossberg), a hill dominating the historic centre (475 m (1,558.40 ft) high), site of a demolished fortress, with views over Graz.\nThe Clock Tower (Uhrturm) is a symbol of Graz, at the top of the Castle hill.\nThe New Gallery (Neue Galerie), a museum of art.\nThe Castle hill funicular (Schlossbergbahn), a funicular railway on the Castle hill's slope.\nThe seat of Styria's provincial parliament (Landhaus), a palace in Lombardic style.

It includes both the grave where Ferdinand II and his wife are buried, and a church dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria.\nThe Castle (Burg), with Gothic double staircase, built between 1438 and 1453 by Emperor Frederick III, because the old castle on the Schlossberg hill was too small and uncomfortable.

In the outer districts buildings are predominantly of the architectural styles from the second half of the 20th century.\nIn 1965 the Grazer Schule (School of Graz) was founded. Several buildings around the universities are of this style, for example the green houses by Volker Giencke and the RESOWI center by G\u00fcnther Domenig.\nBefore Graz became the European Capital of Culture in 2003, several new projects were realized, such as the Stadthalle, the Kindermuseum (museum for children), the Helmut-List-Halle, the Kunsthaus and the Murinsel.\n\nTallest buildings\nBuildings in Graz which are at least 50m tall: \n\n\n=== Sports ===\nSK Sturm Graz is the main football club of the city, with three Austrian championships and five runner-up seasons.

Events have been held at different venues in Graz and in the surrounding region.\n\n\n=== Dialect ===\nReferred to as Steirisch by locals, Graz belongs to the Austro-Bavarian region of dialects, more specifically a mix of Central Bavarian in the western part of Styria and Southern Bavarian in the eastern part. The Grazer ORF, the Graz subsidiary of Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, launched an initiative in 2008 called Scho wieda Steirisch g'redt in order to highlight the numerous dialects of Graz and Styria in general and to cultivate the pride many Styrians hold for their local culture. Two reasons for a melding of these dialects with Standard German: the influence of television and radio bringing Standard German into the home and the industrialization causing the disappearance of the single farmer since the farming communities are seen as the true keepers of dialect speaking.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nAn extensive public transport network makes Graz an easy city to navigate without a car. The city has a comprehensive bus network, complementing the Graz tram network consisting of eight lines. Four lines pass through the underground tram stop at the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof) and on to the city centre before branching out. Furthermore, there are seven night-time bus routes, although these run only at weekends and on evenings preceding public holidays.\nThe Schlossbergbahn, a funicular railway, and the Schlossberg lift, a vertical lift, link the city centre to the Schlossberg.\nFrom the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), regional trains link to most of Styria. Direct trains run to most major cities nearby including Vienna, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Maribor and Ljubljana in Slovenia, Zagreb in Croatia, Budapest in Hungary, Prague and Brno in the Czech Republic, Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland, as well as Munich, Stuttgart, Heidelberg, and Frankfurt in Germany. Trains for Vienna leave every hour. In recent years many railway stations within the city limits and in the suburbs have been rebuilt or modernised and are now part of the \"S-Bahn Graz\", a commuter train service connecting the city with its suburban area and towns nearby.\nGraz airport is located about 10 km (6 mi) south of the city centre and is accessible by bus, railway, and car. Direct destinations include Amsterdam, Berlin, D\u00fcsseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart, Istanbul, Vienna and Zurich.\n\n\n== Health ==\nIn Graz there are seven hospitals, several private hospitals and sanatoriums, as well as 44 pharmacies.\nThe University Hospital Graz (LKH-Universit\u00e4ts-Klinikum Graz) is located in eastern Graz and has 1,556 beds and 7,190 employees.

Furthermore, several non-emergency ambulances (KTW \u2013 Krankentransportwagen) and a Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) are operated by the Red Cross to transport non-emergency patients to and between hospitals. In addition to the Red Cross, the Labourers'-Samaritan-Alliance (Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund \u00d6sterreichs), the Austrian organisation of the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps (Malteser Hospitaldienst Austria) and the Green Cross (Gr\u00fcnes Kreuz) operate ambulances (KTW) for non-emergency patient transport. In addition to the cars, there's also the C12 air ambulance helicopter stationed at Graz airport, staffed with an emergency physician in addition to regular personnel.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nGraz is twinned with:\n\nOther forms of cooperation and city friendship similar to the twin city programmes\n Ni\u0161, Serbia\n Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nThe following are past and present notable residents of Graz.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Austria portal\nList of World Heritage Sites in Austria\nKastner & \u00d6hler\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"Graz: Stadtplanung und Stadtentwicklung (Rechnungshofbericht, 2006) in German\" (PDF). 2006.

        "wiki": "Graz ( GRAHTS, German: [\u0261\u0281a\u02d0ts] (listen); Slovene: Gradec) is the capital city of Styria and Austria's second-largest city after Vienna. As of 1 January 2019, Graz had a population of 328,276 (292,269 of whom had principal-residence status). In 2015, the population of the Graz larger urban zone (LUZ) stood at 633,168, based on principal-residence status. Graz has a long tradition as a seat of higher education. It has four colleges and four universities with more than 60,000 students. Its historic centre  (Altstadt) is one of the best-preserved city centres in Central Europe.For centuries, Graz was more important to Slovenes and Croats, both politically and culturally, than the capitals of Ljubljana, Slovenia and Zagreb, Croatia; it remains influential to this day. In 1999, the city's historic centre was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites and in 2010 the designation was expanded to include Eggenberg Palace (German: Schloss Eggenberg) on the western edge of the city. Graz was designated the Cultural Capital of Europe in 2003 and became a City of Culinary Delights in 2008.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name of the city, Graz, formerly spelled Gratz, most likely stems from the Slavic gradec, which means \"small castle\". Some archaeological finds point to the erection of a small castle by Alpine Slavic people, which over time became a heavily defended fortification. In literary Slovene and Croatian, gradec still means \"small castle\", forming a hypocoristic derivative of Proto-West-South Slavic *grad\u044cc\u044a, whichs descends via liquid metathesis from Common Slavic *gard\u044cc\u044a and via the Slavic third palatalisation from Proto-Slavic *gardiku, originally denoting \"small town, settlement\". The name thus follows the common South Slavic pattern for naming settlements as grad. The German name 'Graz' first appears in records in 1128.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGraz is situated on both sides of the Mur river in southeast Austria. It is about 200 km (120 mi) southwest of Vienna (Wien). The nearest larger urban centre is Maribor (Marburg) in Slovenia, which is about 50 km (31 mi) to the south. Graz is the state capital and largest city in Styria, a green and heavily forested region on the eastern edge of the Alps.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring municipalities ===\nThese towns and villages border Graz:\n\nto the north: Gratkorn, Stattegg, Weinitzen\nto the east: Kainbach bei Graz, Hart bei Graz, Raaba\nto the south: G\u00f6ssendorf, Feldkirchen bei Graz, Seiersberg\nto the west: Attendorf, Thal, Judendorf-Stra\u00dfengel\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nGraz is divided into 17 municipal districts (Stadtbezirke):\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement on the ground of the modern city of Graz dates back to the Copper Age. However, no historical continuity exists of a settlement before the Middle Ages.\nDuring the 12th century, dukes under Babenberg rule made the town into an important commercial center. Later, Graz came under the rule of the Habsburgs and, in 1281, gained special privileges from King Rudolph I.\nIn the 14th century, Graz became the city of residence of the Inner Austrian line of the Habsburgs. The royalty lived in the Schlossberg castle and from there ruled Styria, Carinthia, most of today's Slovenia, and parts of Italy (Carniola, Gorizia and Gradisca, Trieste).\nIn the 16th century, the city's design and planning were primarily controlled by Italian Renaissance architects and artists. One of the most famous buildings representative of this style is the Landhaus, designed by Domenico dell'Allio, and used by the local rulers as a governmental headquarters.\n\nThe University of Graz was founded by Archduke Karl II in 1585, it's the city's oldest university. For most of its existence, it was controlled by the Catholic church, and was closed in 1782 by Joseph II in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a lyceum where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-established as a university by Emperor Franz I, and was named 'Karl-Franzens Universit\u00e4t' or 'Charles-Francis University' in English. More than 30,000 students are currently enrolled at this university.\nThe astronomer Johannes Kepler lived in Graz for a short period. He worked as a math teacher and was a professor of mathematics at the University of Graz, but still found time to study astronomy. He left Graz for Prague when Lutherans were banned from the city.\nLudwig Boltzmann was Professor for Mathematical Physics from 1869 to 1890. During that time, Nikola Tesla studied electrical engineering at the Polytechnic in 1875. Nobel Laureate Otto Loewi taught at the University of Graz from 1909 until 1938. Ivo Andric, the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature Laureate obtained his doctorate at the University of Graz. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger was briefly chancellor of the University of Graz in 1936.\nGraz is centrally located within today's Bundesland (state) of Styria, or Steiermark in German. Mark is an old German word indicating a large area of land used as a defensive border, in which the peasantry is taught how to organize and fight in the case of an invasion. With a strategic location at the head of the open and fertile Mur valley, Graz was historically a target of invaders, such as the Hungarians under Matthias Corvinus in 1481, and the Ottoman Turks in 1529 and 1532. Apart from the Riegersburg Castle, the Schlossberg was the only fortification in the region that never fell to the Ottoman Turks. Graz is home to the region's provincial armory, which is the world's largest historical collection of late medieval and Renaissance weaponry. It has been preserved since 1551, and displays over 30,000 items.\nFrom the earlier part of the 15th century, Graz was the residence of the younger branch of the Habsburgs, which succeeded to the imperial throne in 1619 in the person of Emperor Ferdinand II, who moved the capital to Vienna. New fortifications were built on the Schlossberg at the end of the 16th century. Napoleon's army occupied Graz in 1797. In 1809, the city withstood another assault by the French army. During this attack, the commanding officer in the fortress was ordered to defend it with about 900 men against Napoleon's army of about 3,000. He successfully defended the Schlossberg against eight attacks, but they were forced to give up after the Grande Arm\u00e9e occupied Vienna and the Emperor ordered to surrender. Following the defeat of Austria by Napoleonic forces at the Battle of Wagram in 1809, the fortifications were demolished using explosives, as stipulated in the Peace of Sch\u00f6nbrunn of the same year. The belltower (Glockenturm) and the civic clock tower (Uhrturm), which is a leading tourist attraction and serves as a symbol for Graz, were spared after the citizens of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation.Archduke Karl II of Inner Austria had 20,000 Protestant books burned in the square of what is now a mental hospital, and succeeded in returning Styria to the authority of the Holy See. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was born in Graz in what is now the Stadtmuseum (city museum).\n\n\n== Population development ==\nThe more recent population figures do not give the whole picture as only people with principal-residence status are counted and people with secondary residence status are not. Most of the people with secondary residence status in Graz are students. At the end of 2016 there were 33,473 people with secondary residence status in Graz.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nOceanic climate is the type found in the city, but due to the 0 \u00b0C isotherm, the same occurs in a humid continental climate with based in K\u00f6ppen system (Cfb/Dfb borderline). Wladimir K\u00f6ppen himself was in town and conducted studies to see how the climate of the past influenced the Continental Drift theory. Due to its position southeast of the Alps, Graz is shielded from the prevailing westerly winds that bring weather fronts in from the North Atlantic to northwestern and central Europe. The weather in Graz is thus influenced by the Mediterranean, and it has more hours of sunshine per year than Vienna or Salzburg and also less wind or rain. Graz lies in a basin that is only open to the south, causing the climate to be warmer than would be expected at that latitude. Plants are found in Graz that normally grow much further south.\n\naverage temperatures: Graz Airport 8.7 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) / Karl-Franzens University 9.4 \u00b0C (49 \u00b0F)\naverage rainfall: 818 mm (32 in) with on average 92 days of rain (Karl Franzens University)\naverage hours of sunshine: 1,989 (Karl Franzens University)\n\n\n== Slovenes and Graz ==\nPolitically, culturally, scientifically and religiously, Graz was an important centre for all Slovenes, especially from the establishment of the University of Graz in 1586 until the establishment of University of Ljubljana in 1919. In 1574, the first Slovene Catholic book was published in Graz, and in 1592, Hieronymus Megiser published in Graz the book Dictionarium quatuor linguarum, the first multilingual dictionary of Slovene.The Styrian Slovenes did not consider Graz a German-speaking city, but their own, a place to study while living at their relatives' homes and to fulfill one's career ambitions. The student associations in Graz were a crucible of the Slovene identity, and the Slovene students in Graz were more nationally aware than some others. This led to fierce anti-Slovene efforts of German-speaking nationalists in Graz before and during World War II.Many Slovenian Styrians study there. Slovenes are among the professors at the Institute for Jazz in Graz. Numerous Slovenes have found employment there, while being formerly unemployed in Slovenia. For the Slovene culture, Graz remains permanently important due to its university and the Universalmuseum Joanneum archives containing numerous documents from the Slovenian Styria.A symposium on the relation of Graz and the Slovenes was held in Graz in 2010, at the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the first and oldest chair of Slovene. It was established at the Lyzeum of Graz in July 1811 on the initiative of Janez Nepomuk Primic. A collection of lectures on the topic was published. The Slovenian Post commemorated the anniversary with a stamp.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nFor the year that Graz was Cultural Capital of Europe, new structures were erected. The Graz Museum of Contemporary Art (German: Kunsthaus) was designed by Peter Cook and Colin Fournier and is situated next to the Mur river. The Island in the Mur is a floating platform made of steel. It was designed by American architect Vito Acconci and contains a caf\u00e9, an open-air theatre and a playground.\n\n\n=== Historic city centre ===\n\nThe historic centre was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999 due to the harmonious co-existence of typical buildings from different epochs and in different architectural styles. Situated in a cultural borderland between Central Europe, Italy and the Balkan States, Graz absorbed various influences from the neighbouring regions and thus received its exceptional townscape. Today the historic centre consists of over 1,000 buildings, their age ranging from Gothic to contemporary.\nThe most important sights in the historic centre are:\n\nTown Hall (Rathaus).\nThe Castle hill (German: Schlossberg), a hill dominating the historic centre (475 m (1,558.40 ft) high), site of a demolished fortress, with views over Graz.\nThe Clock Tower (Uhrturm) is a symbol of Graz, at the top of the Castle hill.\nThe New Gallery (Neue Galerie), a museum of art.\nThe Castle hill funicular (Schlossbergbahn), a funicular railway on the Castle hill's slope.\nThe seat of Styria's provincial parliament (Landhaus), a palace in Lombardic style.

It is the 2nd largest opera house in Austria.\nThe Graz Theatre (Schauspielhaus), Graz's principal theatre for productions of plays.\nThe Cathedral (Dom), a rare monument of Gothic architecture. Once, there were many frescos on the outer walls; today, only a few remain, like the Landplagenbild (\"picture of plagues\") painted in 1485, presumably by Thomas von Villach. The three plagues it depicts are locusts, pestilence and the invasion of the Turks, all of them striking the town in 1480. It features the oldest painted view of Graz.\nThe mausoleum of Emperor Ferdinand II next to the cathedral, the most important building of Mannerism in Graz. It includes both the grave where Ferdinand II and his wife are buried, and a church dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria.\nThe Castle (Burg), with Gothic double staircase, built between 1438 and 1453 by Emperor Frederick III, because the old castle on the Schlossberg hill was too small and uncomfortable. The castle remained the residence of the Inner Austrian Court until 1619. Today, it serves as residence for the Styrian government.\nThe Painted House (Gemaltes Haus) in Herrengasse 3. It is completely covered with frescos (painted in 1742 by Johann Mayer).\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art Graz (Kunsthaus)\nThe Island in the Mur (Murinsel), an artificial island in the Mur river.\nBuildings, inner courtyards (e. g.

In 2010 it was added to the existing World Heritage site of the historic centre of Graz.\nThe Mariatrost Basilica (Basilika Mariatrost) a late Baroque church, on the eastern edge of Graz.\nThe Jesus's Heart Church (Herz-Jesu-Kirche) is the largest church in Graz with the third highest spire in Austria, built in Gothic Revival style.\nThe Calvary Hill (Kalvarienberg) in the G\u00f6sting area of Graz with a 17th-century calvary and church.\nThe Graz University Hospital is the largest hospital in Graz and one of the largest hospitals in Austria. It's the largest Jugendstil building complex in Austria and was built between 1904 and 1912. It's run by the province Styria and is one of the most renowned hospitals in Austria and Central Europe.\nBest viewpoints for vistas of the city are the G\u00f6sting Ruin (Ruine G\u00f6sting), a ruin of a hilltop castle on the city's northwestern edge, and Plabutsch/F\u00fcrstenstand, behind Eggenberg Palace, with a hilltop restaurant and viewing tower.\n\n\n=== Greater Graz area ===\n\u00d6sterreichisches Freilichtmuseum St\u00fcbing, an open-air museum containing old farmhouses/farm buildings from all over Austria reassembled in historic setting.\nLurgrotte, the most extensive cave system in Austria.\nLipizzanergest\u00fct Piber, Lipizzaner stud at Piber where the famous horses are bred.\nThe Steirische Weinstra\u00dfe is a wine-growing region south of Graz, also known as the \"Styrian Tuscany\".\nThermenregion, spa region east of Graz.\nRiegersburg Castle, a mighty fortress that was never taken. It was a bastion against Turkish invasions\n\n\n== Culture ==\nDuring 2003 Graz held the title of \"European Capital of Culture\" and was one of the UNESCO \"Cities of Design\" in 2011.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe most important museums in Graz are:\n\nSchloss Eggenberg with Alte Galerie (paintings and sculptures from the Romanesque to the end of the Baroque period), Coin Collection, Lapidarium (Roman stonework collection),Archeological Museum (featuring the Cult Wagon of Strettweg) a special exhibitions area and the 90,000 m2 romantic landscape gardens.\nMuseum im Palais: museum of Styrian cultural history from the Middle Ages to the present.\nNeue Galerie: visual arts from the 19th and 20th centuries.\nNatural History Museum: exhibition of botany, mineralogy and zoology.\nStadtmuseum Graz: city museum.\nKunsthaus: exhibition hall of contemporary art.\nForum Stadtpark: museum of contemporary art.\nCamera Austria: museum of contemporary photography.\nLandeszeughaus: medieval armory comprising 32,000 pieces of armour and weaponry, largest of its kind in the world.\nVolkskundemuseum: museum of folk culture and lore.\nDi\u00f6zesanmuseum: museum of the Roman Catholic Church.\nK\u00fcnstlerhaus: exhibition hall of contemporary visual arts.\nLiteraturhaus: museum of contemporary German literature.\nMuseum der Wahrnehmung: museum of the senses, samadhi bath.\nKindermuseum Frida&Fred: museum for children.\nTramway Museum: 40 historic trams, the oldest dating from 1873.\nKriminalmuseum: museum of criminology.\nLuftfahrtmuseum: (Graz airport) aviation museum.\nHanns Schell Collection: key and lock museum, largest of its kind in the world.\nAustrian Sculpture Park: seven hectares of contemporary sculpture.\nBotanical Garden of Graz: three architecturally interesting glass houses plus gardens.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nThe Old Town and the adjacent districts are characterized by the historic residential buildings and churches found there. In the outer districts buildings are predominantly of the architectural styles from the second half of the 20th century.\nIn 1965 the Grazer Schule (School of Graz) was founded. Several buildings around the universities are of this style, for example the green houses by Volker Giencke and the RESOWI center by G\u00fcnther Domenig.\nBefore Graz became the European Capital of Culture in 2003, several new projects were realized, such as the Stadthalle, the Kindermuseum (museum for children), the Helmut-List-Halle, the Kunsthaus and the Murinsel.\n\nTallest buildings\nBuildings in Graz which are at least 50m tall: \n\n\n=== Sports ===\nSK Sturm Graz is the main football club of the city, with three Austrian championships and five runner-up seasons. The Grazer AK also won an Austrian championship, but went into administration in 2007 and was excluded from the professional league system.\nIn ice hockey, the ATSE Graz was the Austrian Hockey League champion in 1975 and 1978. The EC Graz was runner-up in 1991\u201392, 1992\u201393 and 1993\u201394.

It's still facing referendum, meaning usually the end for many former olympic bids in Europe and North America since 1970 -century.\n\n\n=== Styriarte ===\nGraz hosts the annual festival of classical music Styriarte, founded in 1985 to tie conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt closer to his hometown. Events have been held at different venues in Graz and in the surrounding region.\n\n\n=== Dialect ===\nReferred to as Steirisch by locals, Graz belongs to the Austro-Bavarian region of dialects, more specifically a mix of Central Bavarian in the western part of Styria and Southern Bavarian in the eastern part. The Grazer ORF, the Graz subsidiary of Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, launched an initiative in 2008 called Scho wieda Steirisch g'redt in order to highlight the numerous dialects of Graz and Styria in general and to cultivate the pride many Styrians hold for their local culture. Two reasons for a melding of these dialects with Standard German: the influence of television and radio bringing Standard German into the home and the industrialization causing the disappearance of the single farmer since the farming communities are seen as the true keepers of dialect speaking.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nAn extensive public transport network makes Graz an easy city to navigate without a car. The city has a comprehensive bus network, complementing the Graz tram network consisting of eight lines. Four lines pass through the underground tram stop at the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof) and on to the city centre before branching out. Furthermore, there are seven night-time bus routes, although these run only at weekends and on evenings preceding public holidays.\nThe Schlossbergbahn, a funicular railway, and the Schlossberg lift, a vertical lift, link the city centre to the Schlossberg.\nFrom the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), regional trains link to most of Styria. Direct trains run to most major cities nearby including Vienna, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Maribor and Ljubljana in Slovenia, Zagreb in Croatia, Budapest in Hungary, Prague and Brno in the Czech Republic, Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland, as well as Munich, Stuttgart, Heidelberg, and Frankfurt in Germany. Trains for Vienna leave every hour. In recent years many railway stations within the city limits and in the suburbs have been rebuilt or modernised and are now part of the \"S-Bahn Graz\", a commuter train service connecting the city with its suburban area and towns nearby.\nGraz airport is located about 10 km (6 mi) south of the city centre and is accessible by bus, railway, and car. Direct destinations include Amsterdam, Berlin, D\u00fcsseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart, Istanbul, Vienna and Zurich.\n\n\n== Health ==\nIn Graz there are seven hospitals, several private hospitals and sanatoriums, as well as 44 pharmacies.\nThe University Hospital Graz (LKH-Universit\u00e4ts-Klinikum Graz) is located in eastern Graz and has 1,556 beds and 7,190 employees. The Regional Hospital Graz II (LKH Graz II) has two sites in Graz.

Perpetually two emergency doctor's cars (NEF \u2013 Notarzteinsatzfahrzeug), two NAWs (Notarztwagen \u2013 ambulances staffed with a physician in addition to regular personnel) and about 30 RTWs (Rettungswagen \u2013 regular ambulances) are on standby. Furthermore, several non-emergency ambulances (KTW \u2013 Krankentransportwagen) and a Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) are operated by the Red Cross to transport non-emergency patients to and between hospitals. In addition to the Red Cross, the Labourers'-Samaritan-Alliance (Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund \u00d6sterreichs), the Austrian organisation of the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps (Malteser Hospitaldienst Austria) and the Green Cross (Gr\u00fcnes Kreuz) operate ambulances (KTW) for non-emergency patient transport. In addition to the cars, there's also the C12 air ambulance helicopter stationed at Graz airport, staffed with an emergency physician in addition to regular personnel.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nGraz is twinned with:\n\nOther forms of cooperation and city friendship similar to the twin city programmes\n Ni\u0161, Serbia\n Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nThe following are past and present notable residents of Graz.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Austria portal\nList of World Heritage Sites in Austria\nKastner & \u00d6hler\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"Graz: Stadtplanung und Stadtentwicklung (Rechnungshofbericht, 2006) in German\" (PDF). 2006.

        "wiki": "Graz ( GRAHTS, German: [\u0261\u0281a\u02d0ts] (listen); Slovene: Gradec) is the capital city of Styria and Austria's second-largest city after Vienna. As of 1 January 2019, Graz had a population of 328,276 (292,269 of whom had principal-residence status). In 2015, the population of the Graz larger urban zone (LUZ) stood at 633,168, based on principal-residence status. Graz has a long tradition as a seat of higher education. It has four colleges and four universities with more than 60,000 students. Its historic centre  (Altstadt) is one of the best-preserved city centres in Central Europe.For centuries, Graz was more important to Slovenes and Croats, both politically and culturally, than the capitals of Ljubljana, Slovenia and Zagreb, Croatia; it remains influential to this day. In 1999, the city's historic centre was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites and in 2010 the designation was expanded to include Eggenberg Palace (German: Schloss Eggenberg) on the western edge of the city. Graz was designated the Cultural Capital of Europe in 2003 and became a City of Culinary Delights in 2008.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name of the city, Graz, formerly spelled Gratz, most likely stems from the Slavic gradec, which means \"small castle\". Some archaeological finds point to the erection of a small castle by Alpine Slavic people, which over time became a heavily defended fortification. In literary Slovene and Croatian, gradec still means \"small castle\", forming a hypocoristic derivative of Proto-West-South Slavic *grad\u044cc\u044a, whichs descends via liquid metathesis from Common Slavic *gard\u044cc\u044a and via the Slavic third palatalisation from Proto-Slavic *gardiku, originally denoting \"small town, settlement\". The name thus follows the common South Slavic pattern for naming settlements as grad. The German name 'Graz' first appears in records in 1128.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGraz is situated on both sides of the Mur river in southeast Austria. It is about 200 km (120 mi) southwest of Vienna (Wien). The nearest larger urban centre is Maribor (Marburg) in Slovenia, which is about 50 km (31 mi) to the south. Graz is the state capital and largest city in Styria, a green and heavily forested region on the eastern edge of the Alps.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring municipalities ===\nThese towns and villages border Graz:\n\nto the north: Gratkorn, Stattegg, Weinitzen\nto the east: Kainbach bei Graz, Hart bei Graz, Raaba\nto the south: G\u00f6ssendorf, Feldkirchen bei Graz, Seiersberg\nto the west: Attendorf, Thal, Judendorf-Stra\u00dfengel\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nGraz is divided into 17 municipal districts (Stadtbezirke):\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement on the ground of the modern city of Graz dates back to the Copper Age. However, no historical continuity exists of a settlement before the Middle Ages.\nDuring the 12th century, dukes under Babenberg rule made the town into an important commercial center. Later, Graz came under the rule of the Habsburgs and, in 1281, gained special privileges from King Rudolph I.\nIn the 14th century, Graz became the city of residence of the Inner Austrian line of the Habsburgs. The royalty lived in the Schlossberg castle and from there ruled Styria, Carinthia, most of today's Slovenia, and parts of Italy (Carniola, Gorizia and Gradisca, Trieste).\nIn the 16th century, the city's design and planning were primarily controlled by Italian Renaissance architects and artists. One of the most famous buildings representative of this style is the Landhaus, designed by Domenico dell'Allio, and used by the local rulers as a governmental headquarters.\n\nThe University of Graz was founded by Archduke Karl II in 1585, it's the city's oldest university. For most of its existence, it was controlled by the Catholic church, and was closed in 1782 by Joseph II in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a lyceum where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-established as a university by Emperor Franz I, and was named 'Karl-Franzens Universit\u00e4t' or 'Charles-Francis University' in English. More than 30,000 students are currently enrolled at this university.\nThe astronomer Johannes Kepler lived in Graz for a short period. He worked as a math teacher and was a professor of mathematics at the University of Graz, but still found time to study astronomy. He left Graz for Prague when Lutherans were banned from the city.\nLudwig Boltzmann was Professor for Mathematical Physics from 1869 to 1890. During that time, Nikola Tesla studied electrical engineering at the Polytechnic in 1875. Nobel Laureate Otto Loewi taught at the University of Graz from 1909 until 1938. Ivo Andric, the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature Laureate obtained his doctorate at the University of Graz. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger was briefly chancellor of the University of Graz in 1936.\nGraz is centrally located within today's Bundesland (state) of Styria, or Steiermark in German. Mark is an old German word indicating a large area of land used as a defensive border, in which the peasantry is taught how to organize and fight in the case of an invasion. With a strategic location at the head of the open and fertile Mur valley, Graz was historically a target of invaders, such as the Hungarians under Matthias Corvinus in 1481, and the Ottoman Turks in 1529 and 1532. Apart from the Riegersburg Castle, the Schlossberg was the only fortification in the region that never fell to the Ottoman Turks. Graz is home to the region's provincial armory, which is the world's largest historical collection of late medieval and Renaissance weaponry. It has been preserved since 1551, and displays over 30,000 items.\nFrom the earlier part of the 15th century, Graz was the residence of the younger branch of the Habsburgs, which succeeded to the imperial throne in 1619 in the person of Emperor Ferdinand II, who moved the capital to Vienna. New fortifications were built on the Schlossberg at the end of the 16th century. Napoleon's army occupied Graz in 1797. In 1809, the city withstood another assault by the French army. During this attack, the commanding officer in the fortress was ordered to defend it with about 900 men against Napoleon's army of about 3,000. He successfully defended the Schlossberg against eight attacks, but they were forced to give up after the Grande Arm\u00e9e occupied Vienna and the Emperor ordered to surrender. Following the defeat of Austria by Napoleonic forces at the Battle of Wagram in 1809, the fortifications were demolished using explosives, as stipulated in the Peace of Sch\u00f6nbrunn of the same year. The belltower (Glockenturm) and the civic clock tower (Uhrturm), which is a leading tourist attraction and serves as a symbol for Graz, were spared after the citizens of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation.Archduke Karl II of Inner Austria had 20,000 Protestant books burned in the square of what is now a mental hospital, and succeeded in returning Styria to the authority of the Holy See. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was born in Graz in what is now the Stadtmuseum (city museum).\n\n\n== Population development ==\nThe more recent population figures do not give the whole picture as only people with principal-residence status are counted and people with secondary residence status are not. Most of the people with secondary residence status in Graz are students. At the end of 2016 there were 33,473 people with secondary residence status in Graz.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nOceanic climate is the type found in the city, but due to the 0 \u00b0C isotherm, the same occurs in a humid continental climate with based in K\u00f6ppen system (Cfb/Dfb borderline). Wladimir K\u00f6ppen himself was in town and conducted studies to see how the climate of the past influenced the Continental Drift theory. Due to its position southeast of the Alps, Graz is shielded from the prevailing westerly winds that bring weather fronts in from the North Atlantic to northwestern and central Europe. The weather in Graz is thus influenced by the Mediterranean, and it has more hours of sunshine per year than Vienna or Salzburg and also less wind or rain. Graz lies in a basin that is only open to the south, causing the climate to be warmer than would be expected at that latitude. Plants are found in Graz that normally grow much further south.\n\naverage temperatures: Graz Airport 8.7 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) / Karl-Franzens University 9.4 \u00b0C (49 \u00b0F)\naverage rainfall: 818 mm (32 in) with on average 92 days of rain (Karl Franzens University)\naverage hours of sunshine: 1,989 (Karl Franzens University)\n\n\n== Slovenes and Graz ==\nPolitically, culturally, scientifically and religiously, Graz was an important centre for all Slovenes, especially from the establishment of the University of Graz in 1586 until the establishment of University of Ljubljana in 1919. In 1574, the first Slovene Catholic book was published in Graz, and in 1592, Hieronymus Megiser published in Graz the book Dictionarium quatuor linguarum, the first multilingual dictionary of Slovene.The Styrian Slovenes did not consider Graz a German-speaking city, but their own, a place to study while living at their relatives' homes and to fulfill one's career ambitions. The student associations in Graz were a crucible of the Slovene identity, and the Slovene students in Graz were more nationally aware than some others. This led to fierce anti-Slovene efforts of German-speaking nationalists in Graz before and during World War II.Many Slovenian Styrians study there. Slovenes are among the professors at the Institute for Jazz in Graz. Numerous Slovenes have found employment there, while being formerly unemployed in Slovenia. For the Slovene culture, Graz remains permanently important due to its university and the Universalmuseum Joanneum archives containing numerous documents from the Slovenian Styria.A symposium on the relation of Graz and the Slovenes was held in Graz in 2010, at the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the first and oldest chair of Slovene. It was established at the Lyzeum of Graz in July 1811 on the initiative of Janez Nepomuk Primic. A collection of lectures on the topic was published. The Slovenian Post commemorated the anniversary with a stamp.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nFor the year that Graz was Cultural Capital of Europe, new structures were erected. The Graz Museum of Contemporary Art (German: Kunsthaus) was designed by Peter Cook and Colin Fournier and is situated next to the Mur river. The Island in the Mur is a floating platform made of steel. It was designed by American architect Vito Acconci and contains a caf\u00e9, an open-air theatre and a playground.\n\n\n=== Historic city centre ===\n\nThe historic centre was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999 due to the harmonious co-existence of typical buildings from different epochs and in different architectural styles. Situated in a cultural borderland between Central Europe, Italy and the Balkan States, Graz absorbed various influences from the neighbouring regions and thus received its exceptional townscape. Today the historic centre consists of over 1,000 buildings, their age ranging from Gothic to contemporary.\nThe most important sights in the historic centre are:\n\nTown Hall (Rathaus).\nThe Castle hill (German: Schlossberg), a hill dominating the historic centre (475 m (1,558.40 ft) high), site of a demolished fortress, with views over Graz.\nThe Clock Tower (Uhrturm) is a symbol of Graz, at the top of the Castle hill.\nThe New Gallery (Neue Galerie), a museum of art.\nThe Castle hill funicular (Schlossbergbahn), a funicular railway on the Castle hill's slope.\nThe seat of Styria's provincial parliament (Landhaus), a palace in Lombardic style.

It is the 2nd largest opera house in Austria.\nThe Graz Theatre (Schauspielhaus), Graz's principal theatre for productions of plays.\nThe Cathedral (Dom), a rare monument of Gothic architecture. Once, there were many frescos on the outer walls; today, only a few remain, like the Landplagenbild (\"picture of plagues\") painted in 1485, presumably by Thomas von Villach. The three plagues it depicts are locusts, pestilence and the invasion of the Turks, all of them striking the town in 1480. It features the oldest painted view of Graz.\nThe mausoleum of Emperor Ferdinand II next to the cathedral, the most important building of Mannerism in Graz. It includes both the grave where Ferdinand II and his wife are buried, and a church dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria.\nThe Castle (Burg), with Gothic double staircase, built between 1438 and 1453 by Emperor Frederick III, because the old castle on the Schlossberg hill was too small and uncomfortable. The castle remained the residence of the Inner Austrian Court until 1619. Today, it serves as residence for the Styrian government.\nThe Painted House (Gemaltes Haus) in Herrengasse 3. It is completely covered with frescos (painted in 1742 by Johann Mayer).\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art Graz (Kunsthaus)\nThe Island in the Mur (Murinsel), an artificial island in the Mur river.\nBuildings, inner courtyards (e. g.

In the outer districts buildings are predominantly of the architectural styles from the second half of the 20th century.\nIn 1965 the Grazer Schule (School of Graz) was founded. Several buildings around the universities are of this style, for example the green houses by Volker Giencke and the RESOWI center by G\u00fcnther Domenig.\nBefore Graz became the European Capital of Culture in 2003, several new projects were realized, such as the Stadthalle, the Kindermuseum (museum for children), the Helmut-List-Halle, the Kunsthaus and the Murinsel.\n\nTallest buildings\nBuildings in Graz which are at least 50m tall: \n\n\n=== Sports ===\nSK Sturm Graz is the main football club of the city, with three Austrian championships and five runner-up seasons.

Events have been held at different venues in Graz and in the surrounding region.\n\n\n=== Dialect ===\nReferred to as Steirisch by locals, Graz belongs to the Austro-Bavarian region of dialects, more specifically a mix of Central Bavarian in the western part of Styria and Southern Bavarian in the eastern part. The Grazer ORF, the Graz subsidiary of Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, launched an initiative in 2008 called Scho wieda Steirisch g'redt in order to highlight the numerous dialects of Graz and Styria in general and to cultivate the pride many Styrians hold for their local culture. Two reasons for a melding of these dialects with Standard German: the influence of television and radio bringing Standard German into the home and the industrialization causing the disappearance of the single farmer since the farming communities are seen as the true keepers of dialect speaking.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nAn extensive public transport network makes Graz an easy city to navigate without a car. The city has a comprehensive bus network, complementing the Graz tram network consisting of eight lines. Four lines pass through the underground tram stop at the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof) and on to the city centre before branching out. Furthermore, there are seven night-time bus routes, although these run only at weekends and on evenings preceding public holidays.\nThe Schlossbergbahn, a funicular railway, and the Schlossberg lift, a vertical lift, link the city centre to the Schlossberg.\nFrom the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), regional trains link to most of Styria.

        "wiki": "Graz ( GRAHTS, German: [\u0261\u0281a\u02d0ts] (listen); Slovene: Gradec) is the capital city of Styria and Austria's second-largest city after Vienna. As of 1 January 2019, Graz had a population of 328,276 (292,269 of whom had principal-residence status). In 2015, the population of the Graz larger urban zone (LUZ) stood at 633,168, based on principal-residence status. Graz has a long tradition as a seat of higher education. It has four colleges and four universities with more than 60,000 students. Its historic centre  (Altstadt) is one of the best-preserved city centres in Central Europe.For centuries, Graz was more important to Slovenes and Croats, both politically and culturally, than the capitals of Ljubljana, Slovenia and Zagreb, Croatia; it remains influential to this day. In 1999, the city's historic centre was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites and in 2010 the designation was expanded to include Eggenberg Palace (German: Schloss Eggenberg) on the western edge of the city. Graz was designated the Cultural Capital of Europe in 2003 and became a City of Culinary Delights in 2008.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name of the city, Graz, formerly spelled Gratz, most likely stems from the Slavic gradec, which means \"small castle\". Some archaeological finds point to the erection of a small castle by Alpine Slavic people, which over time became a heavily defended fortification. In literary Slovene and Croatian, gradec still means \"small castle\", forming a hypocoristic derivative of Proto-West-South Slavic *grad\u044cc\u044a, whichs descends via liquid metathesis from Common Slavic *gard\u044cc\u044a and via the Slavic third palatalisation from Proto-Slavic *gardiku, originally denoting \"small town, settlement\". The name thus follows the common South Slavic pattern for naming settlements as grad. The German name 'Graz' first appears in records in 1128.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGraz is situated on both sides of the Mur river in southeast Austria. It is about 200 km (120 mi) southwest of Vienna (Wien). The nearest larger urban centre is Maribor (Marburg) in Slovenia, which is about 50 km (31 mi) to the south. Graz is the state capital and largest city in Styria, a green and heavily forested region on the eastern edge of the Alps.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring municipalities ===\nThese towns and villages border Graz:\n\nto the north: Gratkorn, Stattegg, Weinitzen\nto the east: Kainbach bei Graz, Hart bei Graz, Raaba\nto the south: G\u00f6ssendorf, Feldkirchen bei Graz, Seiersberg\nto the west: Attendorf, Thal, Judendorf-Stra\u00dfengel\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nGraz is divided into 17 municipal districts (Stadtbezirke):\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement on the ground of the modern city of Graz dates back to the Copper Age. However, no historical continuity exists of a settlement before the Middle Ages.\nDuring the 12th century, dukes under Babenberg rule made the town into an important commercial center. Later, Graz came under the rule of the Habsburgs and, in 1281, gained special privileges from King Rudolph I.\nIn the 14th century, Graz became the city of residence of the Inner Austrian line of the Habsburgs. The royalty lived in the Schlossberg castle and from there ruled Styria, Carinthia, most of today's Slovenia, and parts of Italy (Carniola, Gorizia and Gradisca, Trieste).\nIn the 16th century, the city's design and planning were primarily controlled by Italian Renaissance architects and artists. One of the most famous buildings representative of this style is the Landhaus, designed by Domenico dell'Allio, and used by the local rulers as a governmental headquarters.\n\nThe University of Graz was founded by Archduke Karl II in 1585, it's the city's oldest university. For most of its existence, it was controlled by the Catholic church, and was closed in 1782 by Joseph II in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a lyceum where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-established as a university by Emperor Franz I, and was named 'Karl-Franzens Universit\u00e4t' or 'Charles-Francis University' in English. More than 30,000 students are currently enrolled at this university.\nThe astronomer Johannes Kepler lived in Graz for a short period. He worked as a math teacher and was a professor of mathematics at the University of Graz, but still found time to study astronomy. He left Graz for Prague when Lutherans were banned from the city.\nLudwig Boltzmann was Professor for Mathematical Physics from 1869 to 1890. During that time, Nikola Tesla studied electrical engineering at the Polytechnic in 1875. Nobel Laureate Otto Loewi taught at the University of Graz from 1909 until 1938. Ivo Andric, the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature Laureate obtained his doctorate at the University of Graz. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger was briefly chancellor of the University of Graz in 1936.\nGraz is centrally located within today's Bundesland (state) of Styria, or Steiermark in German. Mark is an old German word indicating a large area of land used as a defensive border, in which the peasantry is taught how to organize and fight in the case of an invasion. With a strategic location at the head of the open and fertile Mur valley, Graz was historically a target of invaders, such as the Hungarians under Matthias Corvinus in 1481, and the Ottoman Turks in 1529 and 1532. Apart from the Riegersburg Castle, the Schlossberg was the only fortification in the region that never fell to the Ottoman Turks. Graz is home to the region's provincial armory, which is the world's largest historical collection of late medieval and Renaissance weaponry. It has been preserved since 1551, and displays over 30,000 items.\nFrom the earlier part of the 15th century, Graz was the residence of the younger branch of the Habsburgs, which succeeded to the imperial throne in 1619 in the person of Emperor Ferdinand II, who moved the capital to Vienna. New fortifications were built on the Schlossberg at the end of the 16th century. Napoleon's army occupied Graz in 1797. In 1809, the city withstood another assault by the French army. During this attack, the commanding officer in the fortress was ordered to defend it with about 900 men against Napoleon's army of about 3,000. He successfully defended the Schlossberg against eight attacks, but they were forced to give up after the Grande Arm\u00e9e occupied Vienna and the Emperor ordered to surrender. Following the defeat of Austria by Napoleonic forces at the Battle of Wagram in 1809, the fortifications were demolished using explosives, as stipulated in the Peace of Sch\u00f6nbrunn of the same year. The belltower (Glockenturm) and the civic clock tower (Uhrturm), which is a leading tourist attraction and serves as a symbol for Graz, were spared after the citizens of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation.Archduke Karl II of Inner Austria had 20,000 Protestant books burned in the square of what is now a mental hospital, and succeeded in returning Styria to the authority of the Holy See. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was born in Graz in what is now the Stadtmuseum (city museum).\n\n\n== Population development ==\nThe more recent population figures do not give the whole picture as only people with principal-residence status are counted and people with secondary residence status are not. Most of the people with secondary residence status in Graz are students. At the end of 2016 there were 33,473 people with secondary residence status in Graz.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nOceanic climate is the type found in the city, but due to the 0 \u00b0C isotherm, the same occurs in a humid continental climate with based in K\u00f6ppen system (Cfb/Dfb borderline). Wladimir K\u00f6ppen himself was in town and conducted studies to see how the climate of the past influenced the Continental Drift theory. Due to its position southeast of the Alps, Graz is shielded from the prevailing westerly winds that bring weather fronts in from the North Atlantic to northwestern and central Europe. The weather in Graz is thus influenced by the Mediterranean, and it has more hours of sunshine per year than Vienna or Salzburg and also less wind or rain. Graz lies in a basin that is only open to the south, causing the climate to be warmer than would be expected at that latitude. Plants are found in Graz that normally grow much further south.\n\naverage temperatures: Graz Airport 8.7 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) / Karl-Franzens University 9.4 \u00b0C (49 \u00b0F)\naverage rainfall: 818 mm (32 in) with on average 92 days of rain (Karl Franzens University)\naverage hours of sunshine: 1,989 (Karl Franzens University)\n\n\n== Slovenes and Graz ==\nPolitically, culturally, scientifically and religiously, Graz was an important centre for all Slovenes, especially from the establishment of the University of Graz in 1586 until the establishment of University of Ljubljana in 1919. In 1574, the first Slovene Catholic book was published in Graz, and in 1592, Hieronymus Megiser published in Graz the book Dictionarium quatuor linguarum, the first multilingual dictionary of Slovene.The Styrian Slovenes did not consider Graz a German-speaking city, but their own, a place to study while living at their relatives' homes and to fulfill one's career ambitions. The student associations in Graz were a crucible of the Slovene identity, and the Slovene students in Graz were more nationally aware than some others. This led to fierce anti-Slovene efforts of German-speaking nationalists in Graz before and during World War II.Many Slovenian Styrians study there. Slovenes are among the professors at the Institute for Jazz in Graz. Numerous Slovenes have found employment there, while being formerly unemployed in Slovenia. For the Slovene culture, Graz remains permanently important due to its university and the Universalmuseum Joanneum archives containing numerous documents from the Slovenian Styria.A symposium on the relation of Graz and the Slovenes was held in Graz in 2010, at the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the first and oldest chair of Slovene. It was established at the Lyzeum of Graz in July 1811 on the initiative of Janez Nepomuk Primic. A collection of lectures on the topic was published. The Slovenian Post commemorated the anniversary with a stamp.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nFor the year that Graz was Cultural Capital of Europe, new structures were erected. The Graz Museum of Contemporary Art (German: Kunsthaus) was designed by Peter Cook and Colin Fournier and is situated next to the Mur river. The Island in the Mur is a floating platform made of steel. It was designed by American architect Vito Acconci and contains a caf\u00e9, an open-air theatre and a playground.\n\n\n=== Historic city centre ===\n\nThe historic centre was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999 due to the harmonious co-existence of typical buildings from different epochs and in different architectural styles. Situated in a cultural borderland between Central Europe, Italy and the Balkan States, Graz absorbed various influences from the neighbouring regions and thus received its exceptional townscape. Today the historic centre consists of over 1,000 buildings, their age ranging from Gothic to contemporary.\nThe most important sights in the historic centre are:\n\nTown Hall (Rathaus).\nThe Castle hill (German: Schlossberg), a hill dominating the historic centre (475 m (1,558.40 ft) high), site of a demolished fortress, with views over Graz.\nThe Clock Tower (Uhrturm) is a symbol of Graz, at the top of the Castle hill.\nThe New Gallery (Neue Galerie), a museum of art.\nThe Castle hill funicular (Schlossbergbahn), a funicular railway on the Castle hill's slope.\nThe seat of Styria's provincial parliament (Landhaus), a palace in Lombardic style.

It features the oldest painted view of Graz.\nThe mausoleum of Emperor Ferdinand II next to the cathedral, the most important building of Mannerism in Graz. It includes both the grave where Ferdinand II and his wife are buried, and a church dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria.\nThe Castle (Burg), with Gothic double staircase, built between 1438 and 1453 by Emperor Frederick III, because the old castle on the Schlossberg hill was too small and uncomfortable. The castle remained the residence of the Inner Austrian Court until 1619. Today, it serves as residence for the Styrian government.\nThe Painted House (Gemaltes Haus) in Herrengasse 3. It is completely covered with frescos (painted in 1742 by Johann Mayer).\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art Graz (Kunsthaus)\nThe Island in the Mur (Murinsel), an artificial island in the Mur river.\nBuildings, inner courtyards (e. g.

In the outer districts buildings are predominantly of the architectural styles from the second half of the 20th century.\nIn 1965 the Grazer Schule (School of Graz) was founded. Several buildings around the universities are of this style, for example the green houses by Volker Giencke and the RESOWI center by G\u00fcnther Domenig.\nBefore Graz became the European Capital of Culture in 2003, several new projects were realized, such as the Stadthalle, the Kindermuseum (museum for children), the Helmut-List-Halle, the Kunsthaus and the Murinsel.\n\nTallest buildings\nBuildings in Graz which are at least 50m tall: \n\n\n=== Sports ===\nSK Sturm Graz is the main football club of the city, with three Austrian championships and five runner-up seasons.

Events have been held at different venues in Graz and in the surrounding region.\n\n\n=== Dialect ===\nReferred to as Steirisch by locals, Graz belongs to the Austro-Bavarian region of dialects, more specifically a mix of Central Bavarian in the western part of Styria and Southern Bavarian in the eastern part. The Grazer ORF, the Graz subsidiary of Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, launched an initiative in 2008 called Scho wieda Steirisch g'redt in order to highlight the numerous dialects of Graz and Styria in general and to cultivate the pride many Styrians hold for their local culture. Two reasons for a melding of these dialects with Standard German: the influence of television and radio bringing Standard German into the home and the industrialization causing the disappearance of the single farmer since the farming communities are seen as the true keepers of dialect speaking.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nAn extensive public transport network makes Graz an easy city to navigate without a car. The city has a comprehensive bus network, complementing the Graz tram network consisting of eight lines. Four lines pass through the underground tram stop at the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof) and on to the city centre before branching out. Furthermore, there are seven night-time bus routes, although these run only at weekends and on evenings preceding public holidays.\nThe Schlossbergbahn, a funicular railway, and the Schlossberg lift, a vertical lift, link the city centre to the Schlossberg.\nFrom the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), regional trains link to most of Styria. Direct trains run to most major cities nearby including Vienna, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Maribor and Ljubljana in Slovenia, Zagreb in Croatia, Budapest in Hungary, Prague and Brno in the Czech Republic, Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland, as well as Munich, Stuttgart, Heidelberg, and Frankfurt in Germany. Trains for Vienna leave every hour. In recent years many railway stations within the city limits and in the suburbs have been rebuilt or modernised and are now part of the \"S-Bahn Graz\", a commuter train service connecting the city with its suburban area and towns nearby.\nGraz airport is located about 10 km (6 mi) south of the city centre and is accessible by bus, railway, and car. Direct destinations include Amsterdam, Berlin, D\u00fcsseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart, Istanbul, Vienna and Zurich.\n\n\n== Health ==\nIn Graz there are seven hospitals, several private hospitals and sanatoriums, as well as 44 pharmacies.\nThe University Hospital Graz (LKH-Universit\u00e4ts-Klinikum Graz) is located in eastern Graz and has 1,556 beds and 7,190 employees. The Regional Hospital Graz II (LKH Graz II) has two sites in Graz. The western site (LKH Graz II Standort West) is located in Eggenberg and has 280 beds and about 500 employees, the southern site (LKH Graz II Standort S\u00fcd) specializes in neurology and psychiatry and is located in Stra\u00dfgang with 880 beds and 1,100 employees.

Furthermore, several non-emergency ambulances (KTW \u2013 Krankentransportwagen) and a Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) are operated by the Red Cross to transport non-emergency patients to and between hospitals. In addition to the Red Cross, the Labourers'-Samaritan-Alliance (Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund \u00d6sterreichs), the Austrian organisation of the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps (Malteser Hospitaldienst Austria) and the Green Cross (Gr\u00fcnes Kreuz) operate ambulances (KTW) for non-emergency patient transport. In addition to the cars, there's also the C12 air ambulance helicopter stationed at Graz airport, staffed with an emergency physician in addition to regular personnel.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nGraz is twinned with:\n\nOther forms of cooperation and city friendship similar to the twin city programmes\n Ni\u0161, Serbia\n Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nThe following are past and present notable residents of Graz.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Austria portal\nList of World Heritage Sites in Austria\nKastner & \u00d6hler\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"Graz: Stadtplanung und Stadtentwicklung (Rechnungshofbericht, 2006) in German\" (PDF). 2006.

          "I was there in the morning around 9am and the view from the Clock Tower was stunning. It was highly breathtaking. As the other reviewer mentioned, there was some graffiti along the way up to the Tower, but that was not a great deal. One cannot leave graffiti on the splendid",
          "This is in the middle of a lovely park. There's a couple of statues, lots of seating, trees, plants etc. There's a little pond and the fountain. There might be more to explore, but I only went add far as the fountain. There's so many lovely buildings and parks around. Very",
          "As usual I was walking miles without any Idea where I am going. Came across this park found only two or few people jogging in the morning. The park was very quiet with lot of trees. The fountain is very beautiful. Spent in-front of this fountain around 30 minutes simply watching",

          "It was a two hours road trip to Graz from Ljutomer as i was put up there for 15 days to travel Slovenia and near by countries. I was traveling with one of my friend from Ljutomer to Graz which is the capital of Styria and second largest city in Austria. The Schlossberg Hill (",
          "While I take it that many see ths as a peaceful place to vsit and disconnect, it is a signifcant lost opportunty for the city. There is so much history to be told from this castle and yet everything is unstructured. The one thig that really disappointed was the graffiti around",
          "As young student this was my favourite place to prepare for lectures at university, meaning getting sober after a night of bar hopping. So 35 years later here I was again, walking memory lane, sitting in the morning sun, looking down on the old lady Graz waking up and falling",

          "When we were young, 30 years ago, we called the Schlossberg \"Pensionistengletscher\" which means a glacier for retired people. Why? because it is a very famous recreation area with a marvelous view over Graz for young and old.. and, in the inner city of Graz. Walk up, take a ride",
          "Went to Graz from Vienna for a day after reading about it on net. Hadn't heard of Graz till then. The town was empty as it was a Sunday. We walked from Graz Hbf to Hauptplatz and found our way to the base of the hill. From here there are steps and a lift. One must take the steps",

          "Too many steps to walk up if your are unfit, so take the funicular railway to the top. Well worth the couple of hours spent wandering around the paths, under archways. Great view of the city of Graz down below, good photo opportunity. Plenty of seats to sit and rest. It was a",
          "So you've been to Vienna and lovely Salzburg, well, that's Austria covered, right?. Time to think again. Taking two days to cover the capital of this country's food bowl is worthy of appetising regeneration. Graz's obsession with pumpkin seeds, found in everything from",

          "Many people say to walk up and down the 260 stairs - if you are like me that is not really an option. Instead you can enter one of the tunnels carved into the mountain to avoid air strikes in WWII and ride a glass lift inside the mountain to the top. Well worth the small charge",
          "I visited the Schlossberg with my girlfriend and it was a nice peaceful experience. The sights are beautiful and the small shops and the little market are very cool. I would recommend to anyone who wants to have a beautiful morning.",

          "A beautiful, steep walk takes you to the top of the Castle Hill, and it's worth every step. The views are fantastic, to the city below and the hills and mountains in the background; the old monuments well restored; several restaurants with a view.",
          "Well worth a visit. Great view overlooking the city, popular place for tourists but dosnt get crowded. Not an awful lot to do once you are at the top, but some nice statues, history and cafes. Nice photo opportunities. Probably the main part of Graz city for us.",
          "The Schlossberg is a must-do for any visit to Graz. I recommend taking the funicular train to the top, enjoy the magnificent views of the city, enjoy a meal at the beer garden, and then walk the winding path back to the bottom.",
          "Always great to see my hometown from \"above\", walk up the steep steps or take the cable car, a fantastic view and a delish and refreshing Biergarten awaits u. I'm never tired to view all the old roofs,lush green oasis, the river Mur and of course the Uhrturm, Graz 'z symbol,",

          "A great place for a moderate walk with spectacular views of the city. It is also worth taking a look at night.",
          "For me Schlossberg was a good start of a 1-day walk to explore Graz. Definitely take the cable-car (you can use any standard public transport ticket), which is supersteep and in itself a nice attractions. On the top you'll find a fortress and a few cafes - nothing spectacular",

          "The fit people take the 260 or so steps up from the old town, others take either the funicular or lift. I opted for the lift at \u20ac1.10! Good view over Graz centre. There is an old clock tower and bell tower and an old arena from 1578. There is a jolly \"bandstand\" style area which",
          "We walked up which was quite nice...a good work-out pre-dinner. The grounds are very nice and overlook the town of Graz...and far into the distance. We took the funicular down due to a huge down-pour. It left us just steps away from our hotel.",
          "For some reason my wife decided it would be a good idea to race to the top. She would take the steps and I would take the funicular the winner gets a beer so she said. I was there 15-20 minutes before she was as the funicular was only about 50m from the hotel door and took 2",

          "To be honest I got a little disappointed when I got up there because I was expecting to see the castle!! It turns out that the castle was destroyed and there's only some remains left. Anyways is worth visiting, from the top of the mountain you can have the best views from Graz.",
          "We caught the elevator up and the view from the top is excellent, it really gives you the chance to see all of the centre of Gratz as well as a chance to enjoy the fort and tower on the top. The walk around the top was only slightly up hill in places but worth it to see the",
          "Come come, it's a must-see. I don't advise you to climb up the Clock Tower at 2eu cost. There's nothinggg. But hey, look around. That's fabulous and fantastic views of flora gardens and the whole city landmarks right beneath. Summer sunlight embroiders every corners angel-like",

          "I was sorry, because in the winter you cannot really see the beauty of the park. But the paths were clean, well arranged and the trees prepared for winter. I also liked the signs of the trees, specially if one does not know so many of them.",
          "First thing to do in Graz is to buy a public transport daily ticket. You can walk to the Tourist information centre and they will give you a map of the tramlines. If you are brave you can buy them from the tram stop at the town hall square. This can be used to go up and down",
          "we got up there on a national day (we did not know that before). the bergbahn (funicular) was full of people both ways and so was the park itself. the place of full of local people and there was a smell of sausages and beer all around. Not the worst smell but it was too much of",

          "Spent a very relaxing, lovely sunny spring afternoon there. You can completely forget about the busy and lively streets below, and just enjoy the sun and the views from the top of the city. Nicely decorated ornate gardens bring a 17th century feeling to your walk. Definitely",
          "This is a nice park to go around but I really do not saw anything really special. The weather was not so good and I was during the week, so the park was a little empty. There are a few fountains and some constructions, but anything that I can remember to mention here.",
          "Very interesting gardens on several levels, well signed with information about the (considerable) history of the schlossberg. Some very decent plantings. Keep an eye open for the tiny lizards basking in the sun.",
          "Visiting the hill where the Park is, is a must. Tale enough time for it, as there is quite a lot to see. You can either take the elevator in the centre of town (1 euro) or take a t\u00e9l\u00e9f\u00e9rique. You can also walk back on foot to the centre of town, which gives you spectacular views",
          "This is a very nice park that is elevated up above the city on the Schlo\u00dfberg. The views are incredible and it is not as crowded so also nice to get out the bustling city. Just a bit up from the Uhrturm so nice to de at the same time.",
          "This is a nice place to take a romantic walk, peaceful surroundings, great views, nice meals and learning a bit of history.",
          "Well worth the walk - or you can be lazy and take the funicular or lift - to get the best views of this beautiful city. On a good day you can see down to Slovenia and north to the alpine foothills.",
          "Please don't be disappointed, the fountain does not work at the moment because of refurbishment. The park is beautiful with all the old trees and bushes and flowers. In case the \"Schlossberg\" has been described there is no fountain like the picture shows. I know this because I",
          "It's a hearty walk up about 200 steps to get to this park at the base of Graz's famous clock tower or you cna talke the tram. You pass through hanging gardens where they used to produce wine on the way. Great views of the city center. Lots of local joggers around.",
          "Beautiful views of the most beautiful city ever. We took then tram up and walked for a few hours... absolutely gorgeous",
          "As soon as I saw this place, all the steps put me off being basically lazy, but there is a lift for one euro that takes you quickly to the top. Great views of Graz and surrounds, it was a warm evening so we had a few cold beers taking it all in. Could be better maintained and",
          "There is a little train, called Schlossbergbahn that gets you up to the Schlossberg where also the famous clock tower is situated. You have several restaurant up there and a beautiful view of the city.",
          "We walked the stairs up and the road back down. Great views and cafe/restaurant at the top (there is an elevator if you don't want to walk up). On the way down, we cut through the old air raid shelter cut into the mountain which was cool. Definitely something you should check",
          "We walked up...but there are many ways to get to the top for all fitness levels. It's worth it. It's a big park in the middle of the city. The views are spectacular. There are bars cafes and restaurants as well as a theatre/concert hall. How I wish we were there for the",
          "Good for Graz tourists that everything is within 10 blocks! But you can't check everything in one day...we took a public elevator from the street level, charge was cheap. Up there was a stunning view on whole Graz in Sunday morning. Have a drink at nearby cafe, walk arround and",
          "take the elevator through the mountain to the top - stroll around, and go back by the cablecar - or do it the opoist way - you will have a breathtakig view of the city, plus some nice restaurants arond",
          "took the two easy ways to the top - the stairs are for the mountain climbers. The restaurants are good for sitting in the shade and enjoying the views.",
          "but you can have it downwards as well. These terraced parks was a great visit even in a snowy March weather.",
          "Very nice place. Go by foot. Also, you can buy a combined ticket for lift and venicular (best used in that order - lift up, venicular down).",
          "Take your time to go up by foot!!! It would be a little bit hard but with every step up can discover fantastic views of city roofs! Magic!",
          "It's a very clean and neat park, located at the city center on the ruins of an old fortress. It's worth the effort, specially due to the great view of the city of Graz. Be prepared for long walks!",
          "For the very fit, you can walk up to the Schlossberg, but there is a venicular, which is included in a travel ticket, which is much easier! Beautiful views of Graz from the Schlossberg and well worth the visit.",
          "It is good to have a park in the middle of the town.You can go up to the Schlossberg on foot, by a lift or by a cable railway",
          "I spent 3 days in Graz, and I can say that these park is by far the main attraction of the city (together with the Old City). The park is located on a hill overlooking the whole city; you can reach it both by elevator and by funicular, but if you are quite fit, I warmly suggest",
          "When in Graz, don't miss the chance to visit this delightful park, placed in the vey city center! You can have a long walk along the hills in which it is located, and you can reach the top of the park enjoying the very best view of Graz and the clock tower, both during the day",
          "You can walk up (long and steep), take the lift (doesn`t go right to the top...) or take the funicular railway (Schlossbergbahn) which goes virtually to the top. I prefer the funicular as you get a changing view as it goes up the steep hill in the middle of Graz. There are",
          "The gardens are beautiful and the total panoramic view of the entire city of Graz is well worth climbing the 260 steps!",
          "Nice view over the city, two restaurants, one gourmet, excelent, the other popular, which looked very good.",
          "Beautiful old and old-style city park. Very green in summer, very well kept, different moods for every season. Quite a few exotic trees and bushes, many of them labelled. Lots of benches, recreational activities, people passing through or playing or lounging. The city's back",
          "good place to sunbathe or warch the world go by. Just a few mins walk from the centre of town. Only downside was graffiti",
          "It can be really hot in Graz in the summer and many of the businesses and public transportation are not air-conditioned. It was on such a scorching hot day that we headed to Schlossberg. As I rounded the corner from the street to where the elevator went up, the temperature",

          "Nice, great view, and I loved how the locals enjoy this place, didn't feel touristy.",
          "You can't really visit Graz without visiting here, it's almost a requirement I think. We were lazy and took the elevator up and the rail car down, both were really cool! At the top, it's beautiful to walk around, there are little souvenir shops and places to get something to",
          "A must visit in Graz .... you can walk up the hill, walk uo the steps, use the lift, or the fenicular railway",
          "The public transport was unavailable on that particular day I was there, so I had to climb all the way up the hill through the stairs. Besides, it was raining in earnest. But I enjoyed the walk and the impressive view of Altstadt (Old Town) nonetheless.",

      "name": "Eggenberg Palace, Graz",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Eggenberg Palace (German: Schloss Eggenberg) in Graz, is the most significant Baroque palace complex in the Austrian province of Styria. With its preserved accouterments, the extensive scenic gardens, as well as some special collections from the Universalmuseum Joanneum housed in the palace and surrounding park, Schloss Eggenberg ranks among the most valuable cultural treasures of Austria. Eggenberg Palace is situated at an elevation of 381 meters on the Western edge of the city. Its architectural design and the still visible imprint of centuries of history continue to bear witness to the vicissitude and patronage of the one-time mightiest dynasty in Styria, the House of Eggenberg.\nIn 2010, the significance of Schloss Eggenberg was recognized with an expansion to the listing of the Graz Historic Old Town among the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Sites.\nSurrounded by walls, with a huge portal facing West, the palace is located in the Eggenberg district of Graz and can be reached by tram line. The northern corner of the palace grounds features the Planetary Garden and Lapidarium of Roman stonework as well as the entrance to the new Archeology Museum,[1] which houses the Cult Wagon of Strettweg. At ground level, the palace houses a numismatic collection (Coin Cabinet) located in the former rooms of Balthasar Eggenberger, owner of the imperial minting license and operations in the Late Middle Ages. On the upper level, the Alte Galerie encompasses a large array of paintings, sculptures, and other works of art from the medieval era through the early modern period, spanning five centuries of European art history.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nAt first glance, Schloss Eggenberg presents itself as a uniform, new construction of the 17th century. Nevertheless, large portions of the building date back to the Late Middle Ages and construction continued throughout the early modern era.\nBefore 1460 Balthasar Eggenberger, financier to Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, bought property in the west of Graz which became a fixed noble residence in the family name.  In the subsequent years the family residence was constructed and expanded.  By 1470, a square Gothic chapel had been constructed in the tower.  A Papal indulgence from 30 May 1470 refers to the \u201cCapella Beate Marie Virginis Sita In Castro Eckenperg\u201d, the Chapel of the Virgin Mary in Eggenberg Castle, which became the nucleus of the new palace built by Balthasar's great-grandson, Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg.The younger cousin of General Ruprecht von Eggenberg, Hans Ulrich, as a superb diplomat and statesman, steered the foreign policy of his Emperor, Ferdinand II, while Eggenberg\u2019s counterpart and political adversary,  Cardinal Richelieu of France, guided that of King Louis XIII during Thirty Years War.  As prime minister (in contemporary political jargon) and close, personal confidant of Ferdinand II, Hans Ulrich wanted a grandiose residence representing his new status and authority when he was named \"Gubernator\" (Governor) of Inner Austria after the emperor chose Vienna as his imperial capital.  In 1625 Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg commissioned court architect Giovanni Pietro de Pomis with the planning of his new palace, inspired by El Escorial in Spain. As an architect, painter, and medailleur (designer and minter of medals), de Pomis, originally from Lodi near Milan, became the most important artist at the Grazer court. Incorporating the original medieval family residence into the new palace, de Pomis himself oversaw the construction work up to his death in 1631. Fortress master builder Laurenz van de Syppe continued the work for two years until the building was finished, in the end, by both of de Pomis\u2019 site foremen, Pietro Valnegro and Antonio Pozzo. The shell appears to have been completed by 1635 or 1636. Between 1641 and 1646 work on the ornamentation was brought to a close.\nBeginning in 1666, Johann Seyfried von Eggenberg, grandson of Hans Ulrich, developed the palace according to the splendor and grandeur of the Baroque style and in 1673 the residence again entered the limelight as Archduchess Claudia Felicitas of Tyrol was a guest in the palace on the occasion of her wedding in Graz to Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor.  Under Prince Johann Seyfried, the comprehensive cycle of ceiling coverings of approximately 600 paintings in the rooms of the piano nobile was accomplished in just 7 years. Hans Adam Weissenkircher began his service as the court painter of the princely Eggenberger court in 1678. He finished the painting cycle of the main festival hall, the famous Planetary Room, in 1684/85. With this, the first phase of accouterment work on Schloss Eggenberg was completed.\nAfter the extinction of the male line of the Eggenberg family, the Eggenberger state rooms were left in a half-emptied and neglected state. The husband of the last Eggenberger princess, Johann Leopold Count Herberstein, ordered a comprehensive renewal of the complex.  Between 1754 and 1762 the building and the garden underwent their second major phase of ornamentation, this time in complete accordance with the tastes of the Rococo. Above all, the accouterment of the piano nobile was modernized. Nevertheless, the Planetary Room and the entire cycle of ceiling paintings remained almost unchanged. Thus, the works limited themselves to wall decorations, stoves and pieces of furniture. In keeping with the taste of the times, three East Asian cabinets were introduced and the state rooms received new wall coverings. The most extensive change was probably the demolition of the Eggenberger palace theater, in the place of which a baroque palace church was established. The supervisor of these works was the Grazer court architect Joseph Hueber, a student of Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt.\nThe third phase of the changes came during the 19th century and was limited to the living quarters on the 1st storey (2nd floor in American English) of the palace. The piano nobile remained untouched and unused for a full century. The primary focus of attention of this period was the total transformation of the Baroque formal garden into a romantic landscape garden after the English fashion.\nThe entire complex remained in the possession of the Herberstein family up to 1939. Shortly before the war, Schloss Eggenberg was acquired with the park by the state of Styria. The oldest museum in Austria, the Joanneum, which was established on 26 November 1811 by Archduke Johann of Austria, took over management of the palace and park. The Joanneum conducted extensive restoration work to repair the damage that occurred during World War II and the subsequent occupation by the Allies and in 1953 Schloss Eggenberg and the Eggenberg Schloss Park were finally opened again to the public.\n\n\n=== Scheme ===\n\nWith his new residence, Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg, the mental inspiration behind the complex program, realized an architectural concept deeply influenced by the humanist notions of magic as the praxis of natural philosophy and of the rational order of the world. Above all, astronomy, astrology and alchemy were major components of the education of a worldly prince. In addition to representing the prince\u2019s new rank, all these aspects flowed into the vision of the new building as a symbol of the cosmos as a well-organized, hierarchical, logico-mathematically explicable system.\nSchloss Eggenberg relies on the Gregorian calendar as a basis for this constructed universe. The palace has 365 exterior windows, one for each day of the year.  Of these, 52 are on the 24 rooms of the piano nobile representing the weeks of one year.  The 2nd storey contains these 24 state rooms in a ring-shaped arrangement which symbolize the hours in a single day. Every floor in the building bares exactly 31 rooms counting the maximum number of days in a calendar month.  The 52 windows of the piano nobile with the 8 windows of the Planetary Room make a total of 60, representing both the number of seconds in a minute and the minutes in an hour.\nThe palace is erected on a rectangular plan with the geometrical center being formed by the middle tower with its Gothic chapel. On each corner there is a tower-like rise. Each of these corner-towers represents one of the four seasons and the outside corner of each is aimed exactly in a cardinal direction.\n\n\n=== Planetary Room ===\n\nThe cycle of 24 state rooms culminates in the main festival hall, the Planetary Room and serves as both the beginning and the end of the ring of state rooms. The cycle of the oil paintings in this hall was created by Hans Adam Weissenkircher and displays the four elements, the 12 signs of the Western zodiac and of course the seven classical \u201cplanets\u201d (planetes asteres: wandering stars) known to Antiquity.  The cycle of paintings by Weissenkircher melds the architectural program with the ornamentation of the palace thereby achieving an allegory of the \"Golden Age\" ruled over by the House of Eggenberg.\n\n\n=== Piano nobile ===\n\nThe cycle of some 600 ceiling paintings in the 24 state rooms of the piano nobile recalls the history of the world with scenes from Greek and Roman mythology, religious scenes from the Old Testament, and historical legends from Western Europe. This ceiling program with its stucco framing dates back to the first period of accouterment in the 17th century.\nUnder the married couple Eggenberg-Herberstein, the 24 rooms of the piano nobile were refurbished according to the tastes of the Rococo starting in the mid-18th century. In addition to new pieces of furniture, chandeliers and sconces, and high-quality fa\u00efence stoves, nearly all the rooms also received brand-new, monochrome silk damask wall coverings. Five rooms in the north tract of the piano nobile were equipped with large painted canvasses. Styrian artist Johann Anton Baptist Raunacher dedicated each room to a different subject; shepherd's games, theatrical scenes and gambling scenes are found alongside society scenes and hunting scenes in Schloss Eggenberg. It was during this phase that the Eggenberg palace theater was converted into a palace church in the Baroque style. In addition, three exquisite East Asian cabinets were integrated into the sequence of rooms. The first two are adorned with valuable Imari porcelain plates and bowls as well as Chinese silk paintings. In the wall coverings of the third cabinet, eight panels of a precious Japanese folding screen have been used. These traditional dividers portray the palace and the fortified town of Osaka before 1615, whereby it can be determined that these panels were executed shortly thereafter. From the early modern era there are very few of these screens depicting the city before its destruction, so these works are especially noteworthy. On account of the viewpoint on Osaka the Eggenberg panels represent a unique exhibit.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Gardens ==\nThe various owners and builder-owners have always looked at the palace and at the surrounding gardens as corresponding elements. Thus, every succeeding generation has carried out significant alterations.\n\nThe largest expansion of the garden occurred after the completion of the house. In the last third of the 17th century the garden was generously extended around the building. It followed the pattern of the strictly subdivided Italian garden, with parterres, bosquet areas, fountains, aviaries and pheasant gardens.\nJohann Leopold Count Herberstein allowed the whole arrangement to be reshaped into a French garden. As early as the 1770s, the Eggenberg Gardens were an attraction open to the Grazer public.\n\nHowever, with the advent of the Enlightenment and the liberalization of ideas under Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, by the end of the 18th century, it was thought that Baroque gardens were ugly; having a pruned nature constricted by too stringent norms. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Count Herberstein, as a fanatical garden lover, partook of this perspective and in 1802 prompted the stylish transformation of the Eggenberg Schloss Park into a picturesque English garden.  Labyrinths, fountains, straight paths and hierarchical patterns all had to give way to the call to \"return to nature\" in the sense of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.   Apart from the straight entrance way, which was preserved, the goal was to create artificial vistas with the new, winding pathways and the illusion of being in an Arcadian landscape painting such as those of Claude Lorraine whose works inspired the likes of Stourhead as well as many others.  The recently restored Rose Mound formed the climax of this 19th-century landscape park.\nThe early 20th century saw a dwindling of interest in the palace gardens and the Eggenberg Schloss Park no longer employed a gardener. This had the unfortunate consequences of individual elements of the garden being torn-out and, over the course of decades, the rest being overgrown; the entire arrangement thus becoming more or less a simple city park.\n\nIn 1993, in cooperation with the Austrian Federal Bureau of Cultural Heritage Management (Bundesdenkmalamt), a garden grooming project was begun with the goals of preserving and reconstructing the gardens as a cultural monument to Romanticism. The still existing elements were to be made recognizable and protected and the lost elements reconstructed in so far as it was possible. The initial phases of this project that have already been completed are the reconstruction of the 1848 Breakfast Garden behind the palace and the reclamation and restoration, which occurred during the winter months of 2007/08, of the Rose Mound, one of the most important components of the romantic English landscape garden.\nAdditionally, the peacocks from the Graz Peacock Garden formerly located between the inner city and the city park have found a new home in the Eggenberg Schloss Park.  The species are of both the white variety and the more common Indian blue peacock.  During mating season, the loud cawing of the males as well as their brilliant plumage adds an exotic flair to the splendor of the park as they try to attract the larger but less colorful females.\n\n\n=== Planetary Garden ===\nIn the north corner of the grounds, an enclosed, separate garden went through such diverse transformations and uses over the course of the palace history that in the end it was discernible only by the spatial structure. Due to a lack of surviving records, a new design for the flower garden was decided on in 2000 and a new garden grew out of an old idea. Landscape architect Helga Tornquist took up the theme of the Eggenberg scheme and incorporated it into a contemporary garden creation. This reclamation takes up in a playful fashion the ancient system of planetary \u201csignatures\u201d, which is of special significance for the iconography of Schloss Eggenberg.  The Lapidarium has been established over the foundations of the former orangery as a point of interest and to provide an appropriate setting for the Roman Stonework Collection of the Joanneum.\nSchloss Eggenberg enters the 21st century with the opening of a newly constructed subterranean showroom adjoined to the Lapidarium to house the Joanneum's Pre- and Early History archaeological Collections in autumn of 2009 to be ready for the Joanneum\u2019s bicentennial celebration in 2011.\n\n\n== Commemorative silver euro coin ==\nIn 2002, the Austrian Mint honored the importance of Schloss Eggenberg, by using it as the main motif of one of its most popular silver euro commemorative coins: the 10 euro Eggenberg Palace commemorative coin.  The reverse side shows an image of Johannes Kepler, a personal acquaintance of Eggenberg\u2019s who taught at the former Protestant school in Graz.  His first major work, Mysterium Cosmographicum describing the Copernican system, written while he was still in Graz, likely influenced the symbolism of the design of the palace.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Baroque residences\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nDas Joanneum \u2013 \u00d6sterreichs Universalmuseum [documentary film DVD] By G\u00fcnther Schilhan (director) & Helmut Gesslbauer (producer), Austria: ORF Steiermark, 2006.

          "This beautiful schloss and gardens is worth visiting if only to see all the peacocks and hear their unusual calls. The gardens are beautiful as us the schloss itself and the trees are gnarly and unusual too",

          "Its a great place and fantastic location. Only minus is they have a not very tourist friendly tour shedule. English was only avaliable one tome in the morning and one time in the afternoon. Alone you can not go and see the rooms.",
          "We were here in November on Sunday so the castle's rooms were closed. But the castle is great, very well maintained and the park is huge and wonderful. Best period to go there is from April to October when the rooms are open to anyone (without booking a guided tour).",

          "We didn't get to take the castle tour but walked the grounds and inside the courtyard of the castle. Lovely area and very peaceful in the afternoon. We had some ice cream at the restaurant outside the gate to end the evening as the park closed. Only complaint is that the",
          "Eggenberg palace is not a big palace, HOWEVER it wins my heart! Usually we would expect to see a lot of barriers in a palace, but here in Eggenberg, only guided tour will enables you to visit the chambers, and therefore you will be walking around the rooms without any barrier!",
          "Amazing architectural treasure. We took the guided tour of the second floor staterooms. Incredible to see all the original flooring, furniture and paintings. The castle also contains a wonderful art and coin collection. The tour is in English and you can take as many photos",

          "Eggenberg is a wonderful place where you can spend some free time, if you want to relax and calm down.There is a beautiful park, which is worth walk in every season. I haven't visited the schloss itself, because it was closed, but I was glad to see it at least from the outside.",

          "Our mistake was that we went to see it on a cold day + it was Sunday and we didn't went inside because it was closed. But only feeling that you're in a castle's surrounding gardens with peacocks is keeping you satisfied long after you leave Graz...",
          "A very nice timespending option even without visiting the Schloss (which is definitely worth visiting). The park is so beautiful! Plenty of space to wander, lots of cosy corners to explore. The Planet garden is lovely. Lots of peacocs. English tour to the castle is free and run",
          "The castle is surrounded with a very large park. The park is very serene, and we could see a few pretty peacocks roaming in that area. We nearly missed a small pond on the right side of the castle. There is also a museum behind the castle, but it was closed when we visited,",
          "I first visited the Schloss and the park in my childhood and have loved returning there ever since! The castle has nice exhibitions, concerts and ist a stunning building, and offers a great shop; but I even like the garden more, which is a nice experience in every season, offers",

          "Nice castle. The park around are amazing. There are separate entrance fees for the park and for the inside of the castle (you buy the latter at the castle entrance). Be sure to get there earlier so you don't miss the the room guided tour, like we do. But I suppose it is well",

          "The Room Tour is interesting and well promoted but it was the gallery that was amazing. The stained glass and works from 1100 to 1550 were wonderful and you can get really close. Very underrated!",
          "It is certainly worth to make a tour to Schloss Eggenberg, cheap entrance fee, EUR 8, but you see a very beautiful castle, not Windsor but small and very well looked after, also the park which surrounds the castle is worth to visit.",
          "The palace is set in a huge and peaceful park with gardens and peacocks (which unfortunately have had most of their tail feathers pulled out). The palace is nice though not amazing and it was not clear upon entry that you had to pay an additional fee to enter the museums inside.",
          "Schloss Eggenberg is well worth a visit for several reasons. First, it houses the Alte Galerie with a terrific and well-designed exhibit of medieval and renaissance art, The explanations are in English and German and the thematic design of the exhibit is highly effective and",
          "Good time to visit in the warmer months, you can stroll though the grounds, watching the peacocks at their display. Join a tour to see the rooms on thefirst floor, and .... Well,way more to see there than I thought, as it is just a small castle in styria!",
          "We visited this palace in summer. The garden is much bigger than the palace itself. The roses garden is nice, and we just strolled around and enjoyed the green grass. Also, there is the archeological museum, pretty boring for me... Whoever been to Schonbrunn in Vienna - there is",
          "this is a must-see spot if it is your first time to Graz. Very easy to access by public transport. Don't miss the guided tour that are in German or in English. Disappointed that there is no English description in the coin museum. The entrance fee of the Park leading to the",

          "This is a baroque palace, make no mistake. But it still looks and feels as though a family owns it and has used it. In good, cared-for condition but feels and looks as though the pictures ,furniture etc have not been planted for effect. Overall, a very positive experience.",
          "A must when You are in Graz. Castle with its garden is easy accessible from the centre of Graz. Take the tram no1 and it will lead You to the gate. Unfortunately only the group tour is allowed and it can be a bit boring. While waiting your tour there is a small cafe in the",
          "This is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it did not fail to live up to its status. The ceiling paintings alone were worth the visit. They were completed in the 1600s and are in phenomenally great shape considering their age. The palace is a work of art in and of itself, with",

          "The guided tour, in English, of the state rooms for just 2 of us, was magnificent. Do not miss the art gellery - it's very fine and well organised.",
          "The State Rooms are well worth a visit, the British equivalent is a stately home. Impressive painted ceilings and walls, interesting Art collection",
          "Set in beautiful and well maintained gardens. It is a castle built in the baroque style built around an internal courtyard. The entrance fee is modest and you can visit the interior and see the rooms and the church. In 2002 the Austrian Mint produced a commemorative gold coin",
          "This castle had already been in existence for a century or more before the Hapsbergs more famous castle in Vienna ( Schonbrun ) was even getting updated from a hunting lodge ..... Kids went nuts over the peacocks strutting about the property . Easy access in and out . We liked",
          "If you are looking for some peace and nature do not miss this park",
          "The Schloss Eggenberg is located to the west of the town center. Although it pales compared to other castles it is worth a visit when you are in Graz. They have a small but excellent art museum with mostly religious works from the 14th through 18th century. A few major pieces"

        "wiki": "The Schlossbergbahn, or Schlo\u00dfbergbahn (English: Castle Hill Railway), is a funicular railway in the Austrian city of Graz. It connects the city centre with the Schlo\u00dfberg, a hill and the site of a demolished fortress, with extensive views over the city.The Schlossbergbahn should not be confused with the Schlossberg lift, a vertical lift which links the Schlo\u00dfberg with the tunnel system beneath the hill, and via that with the city centre.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe current Schlossbergbahn was not the first line on the Schlo\u00dfberg, with records of a line being in use between 1528 and 1595 to move construction materials for the fortifications. After the military left the Schlo\u00dfberg in 1856, discussions started on ways to make it more accessible, and in 1893 construction started on the current line.In 1894 the line opened, using a steam engine to haul the cable and with a Riggenbach rack rail for braking. The haulage system was unusual in that whilst the 40 horsepower (30 kW) steam engine was at the upper station, the boiler was at the lower station, with the two linked by steam pipes.The line was converted to electric haulage over the winter of 1899/1900, using current supplied by the Graz tramway system and to a design modeled on the San Salvatore funicular in Lugano, Switzerland. At around the same time, the line was transferred from private ownership to the ownership of the city of Graz.In 1960/1961, the line was modernised and both stations were completely rebuilt. The cars were replaced, with the original cars going to the Graz Tramway Museum and the Vienna Technical Museum.In 2000, the Schlossberg lift was constructed to provide an alternative route between city and summit in time for the city's spell as Cultural Capital of Europe in 2003. In 2004, the Schlossbergbahn was again modernised, with both cars being replaced and both stations reconstructed, at a cost of \u20ac2.5 million. The new cars were designed in cooperation with the Fachhochschule f\u00fcr Industrial Design, and have glass roofs, to allow passengers to see the view over the city.\n\n\n== Operation ==\n\nThe line is operated by Holding Graz, who also operate the city's tram network. It operates between 09:00 and midnight seven days a week, with extended operation until 02:00 the following day on Thursdays to Saturdays.The line's lower station is served by the Schlo\u00dfbergbahn stop, on routes 4 and 5 of the city's tram network. It is some 500 m (1,600 ft) north of the city's Hauptplatz.\nThe line has the following technical parameters:\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of funicular railways\n\n\n== Photo gallery ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSchlossbergbahn page from the Holding Graz web site (in German)\nVideo of the line from YouTube",

        "wiki": "Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger (; German: [\u02c8a\u0281n\u0254lt \u02c8\u0283va\u0281tsn\u0329\u02cc\u0294\u025b\u0261\u0250]; born July 30, 1947) is an Austrian-American actor, businessman, and former politician and professional bodybuilder. He served as the 38th Governor of California from 2003 to 2011. As of 2020, he is the most recent Republican governor of California.\nSchwarzenegger began lifting weights at the age of 15, and went on to win the Mr. Universe title at age 20 before winning the Mr. Olympia contest seven times; he remains a prominent presence in bodybuilding and has written many books and articles on the sport. The Arnold Sports Festival, considered the second most important bodybuilding event after Mr. Olympia, is named after him. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest bodybuilders of all time, as well as the sport's most charismatic and famous ambassador.Schwarzenegger gained worldwide fame as a Hollywood action film icon. His breakthrough film was the sword-and-sorcery epic Conan the Barbarian (1982), a box-office hit that resulted in a sequel in 1984. He appeared as the title character in James Cameron's critically and commercially successful sci-fi action film The Terminator (1984), and subsequently played a similar character in the films Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003), Terminator Genisys (2015), and Terminator: Dark Fate (2019). He also starred in other successful action films such as Commando (1985), The Running Man (1987), Predator (1987), Total Recall (1990), and True Lies (1994), in addition to comedy films such as Twins (1988), Kindergarten Cop (1990), Junior (1994), and Jingle All The Way (1996).\nA Republican, Schwarzenegger was first elected on October 7, 2003, in a special recall election to replace then-Governor Gray Davis. He was sworn in on November 17, to serve the remainder of Davis' term. He was then re-elected in the 2006 California gubernatorial election, to serve a full term as governor. In 2011, he completed his second term as governor and returned to acting.\nSchwarzenegger was nicknamed the \"Austrian Oak\" in his bodybuilding days, \"Arnie\" or \"Schwarzy\" during his acting career, and \"The Governator\" (a portmanteau of \"Governor\" and \"Terminator\") during his political career. He married Maria Shriver, the niece of 35th U.S. President John F. Kennedy, in 1986. They separated in 2011 after he admitted to having fathered a child with their housemaid in 1997, and their divorce was finalized in 2017.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nArnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born on July 30, 1947 in Thal, Styria, the second son of Aurelia (n\u00e9e Jadrny; 1922\u20131998) and Gustav Schwarzenegger (1907\u20131972). His father was the local chief of police and had served in World War II as a Hauptfeldwebel after voluntarily joining the Nazi Party in 1938. He was wounded in the Battle of Stalingrad, but was discharged in 1943 following a bout of malaria. He married Aurelia on October 20, 1945; he was 38 and she was 23. According to Schwarzenegger, his parents were very strict: \"Back then in Austria it was a very different world ... if we did something bad or we disobeyed our parents, the rod was not spared.\" He grew up in a Catholic family who attended Mass every Sunday. Gustav had a preference for his elder son, Meinhard, over Schwarzenegger. His favoritism was \"strong and blatant\", which stemmed from unfounded suspicion that Schwarzenegger was not his biological child. Schwarzenegger has said that his father had \"no patience for listening or understanding your problems\". He had a good relationship with his mother, with whom he kept in touch until her death. In later life, he commissioned the Simon Wiesenthal Center to research his father's wartime record, which came up with no evidence of Gustav being involved in atrocities despite his membership in the Nazi Party and Sturmabteilung (SA). Gustav's background received wide press attention during the 2003 California recall campaign.At school, Schwarzenegger was reportedly academically average, but stood out for his \"cheerful, good-humored, and exuberant\" character. Money was a problem in their household; Schwarzenegger recalled that one of the highlights of his youth was when the family bought a refrigerator. Heavily influenced by his father, he played several sports as a boy. He began weight training in 1960, when his soccer coach took his team to a local gym. At the age of 14, he chose bodybuilding over soccer as a career. He later said, \"I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start Olympic lifting.\" However, his official website biography claims that \"at 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career.\" During a speech in 2001, he said, \"My own plan formed when I was 14 years old. My father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was. My mother wanted me to go to trade school.\"\n\nSchwarzenegger took to visiting a gym in Graz, where he also frequented the local movie theaters to see bodybuilding idols such as Reg Park, Steve Reeves, and Johnny Weissmuller on the big screen. When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: \"As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve.\" In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz. He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends, so that he could train even when it was closed. \"It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look at myself in the mirror the next morning if I didn't do it.\" When Schwarzenegger was asked about his first movie experience as a boy, he replied: \"I was very young, but I remember my father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels. The first real movie I saw, that I distinctly remember, was a John Wayne movie.\"Schwarzenegger's brother, Meinhard, died in a car crash on May 20, 1971. He was driving drunk and died instantly. Schwarzenegger did not attend his funeral. Meinhard was engaged to Erika Knapp, and they had a three-year-old son named Patrick. Schwarzenegger paid for Patrick's education and helped him to move to the U.S. Gustav died on December 13, 1972, from a stroke. In Pumping Iron, Schwarzenegger claimed that he did not attend his father's funeral because he was training for a bodybuilding contest. Later, he and the film's producer said this story was taken from another bodybuilder to show the extremes some would go to for their sport and to make Schwarzenegger's image colder to create controversy for the film. However, Barbara Baker, his first serious girlfriend, recalled that he informed her of his father's death without emotion and that he never spoke of his brother. Over time, he has given at least three versions of why he was absent from his father's funeral.In an interview with Fortune in 2004, Schwarzenegger told how he suffered what \"would now be called child abuse\" at the hands of his father: \"My hair was pulled. I was hit with belts. So was the kid next door. It was just the way it was. Many of the children I've seen were broken by their parents, which was the German-Austrian mentality. They didn't want to create an individual. It was all about conforming. I was one who did not conform, and whose will could not be broken. Therefore, I became a rebel. Every time I got hit, and every time someone said, 'You can't do this,' I said, 'This is not going to be for much longer because I'm going to move out of here. I want to be rich. I want to be somebody.'\"Schwarzenegger served in the Austrian Army in 1965 to fulfill the one year of service required at the time of all 18-year-old Austrian males. During his army service, he won the Junior Mr. Europe contest. He went AWOL during basic training so he could take part in the competition and then spent a week in military prison: \"Participating in the competition meant so much to me that I didn't carefully think through the consequences.\" He entered another bodybuilding contest in Graz, at Steirerhof Hotel, where he placed second. He was voted \"best-built man of Europe\", which made him famous in bodybuilding circles. \"The Mr. Universe title was my ticket to America\u2014the land of opportunity, where I could become a star and get rich.\" Schwarzenegger made his first plane trip in 1966, attending the NABBA Mr. Universe competition in London. He would come in second in the Mr. Universe competition, not having the muscle definition of American winner Chester Yorton.Charles \"Wag\" Bennett, one of the judges at the 1966 competition, was impressed with Schwarzenegger and he offered to coach him. As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in Forest Gate, London. Yorton's leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs. Staying in the East End of London helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language. Living with the Bennetts also changed him as a person: \"Being with them made me so much more sophisticated. When you're the age I was then, you're always looking for approval, for love, for attention and also for guidance. At the time, I wasn't really aware of that. But now, looking back, I see that the Bennett family fulfilled all those needs. Especially my need to be the best in the world. To be recognized and to feel unique and special. They saw that I needed that care and attention and love.\"Also in 1966, while at Bennett's home, Schwarzenegger had the opportunity to meet childhood idol Reg Park, who became his friend and mentor. The training paid off and, in 1967, Schwarzenegger won the title for the first time, becoming the youngest ever Mr. Universe at the age of 20. He would go on to win the title a further three times. Schwarzenegger then flew back to Munich, where he attended a business school and worked in a health club (Rolf Putziger's gym, where he worked and trained from 1966 to 1968), returning in 1968 to London to win his next Mr. Universe title. He frequently told Roger C. Field, his English coach and friend in Munich at that time, \"I'm going to become the greatest actor!\"Schwarzenegger, who dreamed of moving to the U.S. since the age of 10, and saw bodybuilding as the avenue through which to do so, realized his dream by moving to the United States in October 1968 at the age of 21, speaking little English. There he trained at Gold's Gym in Venice, Los Angeles, California, under Joe Weider's supervision. From 1970 to 1974, one of Schwarzenegger's weight training partners was Ric Drasin, a professional wrestler who designed the original Gold's Gym logo in 1973. Schwarzenegger also became good friends with professional wrestler Superstar Billy Graham. In 1970, at age 23, he captured his first Mr. Olympia title in New York, and would go on to win the title a total of seven times.The immigration law firm Siskind & Susser has stated that Schwarzenegger may have been an illegal immigrant at some point in the late 1960s or early 1970s because of violations in the terms of his visa. LA Weekly would later say in 2002 that Schwarzenegger is the most famous immigrant in America, who \"overcame a thick Austrian accent and transcended the unlikely background of bodybuilding to become the biggest movie star in the world in the 1990s\".In 1977, Schwarzenegger's autobiography/weight-training guide Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder became a huge success. In 1977 he posed for the gay magazine After Dark. Due to taking an assortment of courses at Santa Monica College in California (including English classes), as well as further upper division classes at the University of California, Los Angeles as part of UCLA's extension program, Schwarzenegger had by then accumulated enough credits so as to be \"within striking distance\" of graduation. In 1979 he enrolled in the University of Wisconsin\u2013Superior as a distance education student, completing most of his coursework by correspondence and flying out to Superior in order to meet professors and take final exams. In May 1980, he formally graduated and received his bachelor's degree in business administration and marketing. He got his United States citizenship in 1983.Schwarzenegger said that during this time he encountered a friend who told him he was teaching Transcendental Meditation (TM), which prompted Schwarzenegger to reveal that he had been struggling with anxiety for the first time in his life: \"Even today, I still benefit from [the year of TM] because I don't merge and bring things together and see everything as one big problem.\"\n\n\n== Bodybuilding career ==\nSchwarzenegger is considered among the most important figures in the history of bodybuilding, and his legacy is commemorated in the Arnold Classic annual bodybuilding competition. He has remained a prominent face in bodybuilding long after his retirement, in part because of his ownership of gyms and fitness magazines. He has presided over numerous contests and awards shows.\nFor many years, he wrote a monthly column for the bodybuilding magazines Muscle & Fitness and Flex. Shortly after being elected governor, he was appointed the executive editor of both magazines, in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate $250,000 a year to the Governor's various physical fitness initiatives. When the deal, including the contract that gave Schwarzenegger at least $1 million a year, was made public in 2005, many criticized it as being a conflict of interest since the governor's office made decisions concerning regulation of dietary supplements in California. Consequently, Schwarzenegger relinquished the executive editor role in 2005. American Media Inc., which owns Muscle & Fitness and Flex, announced in March 2013 that Schwarzenegger had accepted their renewed offer to be executive editor of the magazines.One of the first competitions he won was the Junior Mr. Europe contest in 1965. He won Mr. Europe the following year, at age 19. He would go on to compete in many bodybuilding contests, and win most of them. His bodybuilding victories included five Mr. Universe wins (4 \u2013 NABBA [England], 1 \u2013 IFBB [USA]), and seven Mr. Olympia wins, a record which would stand until Lee Haney won his eighth consecutive Mr. Olympia title in 1991.\nSchwarzenegger continues to work out. When asked about his personal training during the 2011 Arnold Classic he said that he was still working out a half an hour with weights every day.\n\n\n=== Powerlifting/weightlifting ===\nDuring Schwarzenegger's early years in bodybuilding, he also competed in several Olympic weightlifting and powerlifting contests. Schwarzenegger's first professional competition was in 1963 and he won two weightlifting contests in 1964 and 1965, as well as two powerlifting contests in 1966 and 1968.In 1967, Schwarzenegger won the Munich stone-lifting contest, in which a stone weighing 508 German pounds (254 kg / 560 lb) is lifted between the legs while standing on two footrests.\n\n\n==== Personal records ====\nClean and press \u2013 264 lb (120 kg)\nSnatch \u2013 243 lb (110 kg)\nClean and jerk \u2013 298 lb (135 kg)\nSquat \u2013 545 lb (247 kg)\nBench press \u2013 520 lb (240 kg)\nDeadlift \u2013 710 lb (320 kg)\n\n\n=== Mr. Olympia ===\nSchwarzenegger's goal was to become the greatest bodybuilder in the world, which meant becoming Mr. Olympia. His first attempt was in 1969, when he lost to three-time champion Sergio Oliva. However, Schwarzenegger came back in 1970 and won the competition, making him the youngest ever Mr. Olympia at the age of 23, a record he still holds to this day.He continued his winning streak in the 1971\u201374 competitions. In 1975, Schwarzenegger was once again in top form, and won the title for the sixth consecutive time, beating Franco Columbu. After the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, Schwarzenegger announced his retirement from professional bodybuilding.Months before the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, filmmakers George Butler and Robert Fiore persuaded Schwarzenegger to compete, in order to film his training in the bodybuilding documentary called Pumping Iron. Schwarzenegger had only three months to prepare for the competition, after losing significant weight to appear in the film Stay Hungry with Jeff Bridges. Although significantly taller and heavier, Lou Ferrigno proved not to be a threat, and a lighter-than-usual Schwarzenegger convincingly won the 1975 Mr. Olympia.\nSchwarzenegger came out of retirement, however, to compete in the 1980 Mr. Olympia. Schwarzenegger was training for his role in Conan, and he got into such good shape because of the running, horseback riding and sword training, that he decided he wanted to win the Mr. Olympia contest one last time. He kept this plan a secret in the event that a training accident would prevent his entry and cause him to lose face. Schwarzenegger had been hired to provide color commentary for network television when he announced at the eleventh hour that, while he was there, \"Why not compete?\" Schwarzenegger ended up winning the event with only seven weeks of preparation. Having been declared Mr. Olympia for a seventh time, Schwarzenegger then officially retired from competition. This victory (subject of the documentary \"The Comeback\") was highly controversial, though, as fellow competitors and many observers felt that his lack of muscle mass (especially in his thighs) and subpar conditioning shouldn't have allowed him to go ahead of a very competitive lineup that year; Mike Mentzer, in particular, felt cheated and withdrew from competitive bodybuilding after that contest.\n\n\n=== Steroid use ===\nSchwarzenegger has acknowledged using performance-enhancing anabolic steroids while they were legal, writing in 1977 that \"steroids were helpful to me in maintaining muscle size while on a strict diet in preparation for a contest. I did not use them for muscle growth, but rather for muscle maintenance when cutting up.\" He has called the drugs \"tissue building\".In 1999, Schwarzenegger sued Willi Heepe, a German doctor who publicly predicted his early death on the basis of a link between his steroid use and his later heart problems. As the doctor had never examined him personally, Schwarzenegger collected a US$10,000 libel judgment against him in a German court. In 1999, Schwarzenegger also sued and settled with Globe, a U.S. tabloid which had made similar predictions about the bodybuilder's future health.\n\n\n=== List of competitions ===\n\n\n== Statistics ==\nHeight: 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m)\nContest weight: 235 lb (107 kg)\u2014the lightest in 1980 Mr. Olympia: around 225 lb (102 kg), the heaviest in 1974 Mr. Olympia: around 250 lb (110 kg)\nOff-season weight: 260 lb (118 kg)\nChest: 57 in (1,400 mm)\nWaist: 34 in (860 mm)\nArms: 22 in (560 mm)\nThighs: 28.5 in (720 mm)\nCalves: 20 in (510 mm)\n\n\n== Acting career ==\n\n\n=== Early roles ===\nSchwarzenegger wanted to move from bodybuilding into acting, finally achieving it when he was chosen to play the title role in Hercules in New York (1970). Credited under the stage name \"Arnold Strong\", his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were dubbed after production. His second film appearance was as a deaf-mute mob hitman in The Long Goodbye (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film Stay Hungry (1976), for which he won the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year \u2013 Actor. Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career: \"It was very difficult for me in the beginning \u2013 I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long. You name it, and they told me I had to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned, I was told that I had no chance.\"Schwarzenegger drew attention and boosted his profile in the bodybuilding film Pumping Iron (1977), elements of which were dramatized. In 1991, he purchased the rights to the film, its outtakes, and associated still photography. In 1977, he made guest appearances in single episodes of the ABC sitcom The San Pedro Beach Bums and the ABC police procedural The Streets of San Francisco. Schwarzenegger auditioned for the title role of The Incredible Hulk, but did not win the role because of his height. Later, Lou Ferrigno got the part of Dr. David Banner's alter ego. Schwarzenegger appeared with Kirk Douglas and Ann-Margret in the 1979 comedy The Villain. In 1980, he starred in a biographical film of the 1950s actress Jayne Mansfield as Mansfield's husband, Mickey Hargitay.\n\n\n=== Action superstar ===\nSchwarzenegger's breakthrough film was the sword-and-sorcery epic Conan the Barbarian in 1982, which was a box-office hit. This was followed by a sequel, Conan the Destroyer, in 1984, although it was not as successful as its predecessor. In 1983, Schwarzenegger starred in the promotional video, Carnival in Rio. In 1984, he made his first appearance as the eponymous character, and what some would say was his acting career's signature role, in James Cameron's science fiction thriller film The Terminator. Following this, Schwarzenegger made Red Sonja in 1985.\nDuring the 1980s, audiences had an appetite for action films, with both Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone becoming international stars. Schwarzenegger's roles reflected his sense of humor, separating him from more serious action hero films. He made a number of successful action films in the 1980s, such as Commando (1985), Raw Deal (1986), The Running Man (1987), Predator (1987), and Red Heat (1988).\n\nTwins (1988), a comedy with Danny DeVito, also proved successful. Total Recall (1990) netted Schwarzenegger $10 million (equivalent to $19.6 million today) and 15% of the film's gross. A science fiction script, the film was based on the Philip K. Dick short story \"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\". Kindergarten Cop (1990) reunited him with director Ivan Reitman, who directed him in Twins. Schwarzenegger had a brief foray into directing, first with a 1990 episode of the TV series Tales from the Crypt, entitled \"The Switch\", and then with the 1992 telemovie Christmas in Connecticut. He has not directed since.\nSchwarzenegger's commercial peak was his return as the title character in 1991's Terminator 2: Judgment Day, which was the highest-grossing film of 1991. In 1993, the National Association of Theatre Owners named him the \"International Star of the Decade\". His next film project, the 1993 self-aware action comedy spoof Last Action Hero, was released opposite Jurassic Park, and did not do well at the box office. His next film, the comedy drama True Lies (1994), was a popular spy film and saw Schwarzenegger reunited with James Cameron.\nThat same year, the comedy Junior was released, the last of Schwarzenegger's three collaborations with Ivan Reitman and again co-starring Danny DeVito. This film brought him his second Golden Globe nomination, this time for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. It was followed by the action thriller Eraser (1996), the Christmas comedy Jingle All The Way (1996), and the comic book-based Batman & Robin (1997), in which he played the villain Mr. Freeze. This was his final film before taking time to recuperate from a back injury. Following the critical failure of Batman & Robin, his film career and box office prominence went into decline. He returned with the supernatural thriller End of Days (1999), later followed by the action films The 6th Day (2000) and Collateral Damage (2002), both of which failed to do well at the box office. In 2003, he made his third appearance as the title character in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, which went on to earn over $150 million domestically (equivalent to $208 million today).\n\nIn tribute to Schwarzenegger in 2002, Forum Stadtpark, a local cultural association, proposed plans to build a 25-meter-tall (80 ft) Terminator statue in a park in central Graz. Schwarzenegger reportedly said he was flattered, but thought the money would be better spent on social projects and the Special Olympics.\n\n\n=== Retirement ===\nHis film appearances after becoming Governor of California included a three-second cameo appearance in The Rundown, and the 2004 remake of Around the World in 80 Days. In 2005, he appeared as himself in the film The Kid & I. He voiced Baron von Steuben in the Liberty's Kids episode \"Valley Forge\". He had been rumored to be appearing in Terminator Salvation as the original T-800; he denied his involvement, but he ultimately did appear briefly via his image being inserted into the movie from stock footage of the first Terminator movie. Schwarzenegger appeared in Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables, where he made a cameo appearance.\n\n\n=== Return to acting ===\nIn January 2011, just weeks after leaving office in California, Schwarzenegger announced that he was reading several new scripts for future films, one of them being the World War II action drama With Wings as Eagles, written by Randall Wallace, based on a true story.On March 6, 2011, at the Arnold Seminar of the Arnold Classic, Schwarzenegger revealed that he was being considered for several films, including sequels to The Terminator and remakes of Predator and The Running Man, and that he was \"packaging\" a comic book character. The character was later revealed to be the Governator, star of the comic book and animated series of the same name. Schwarzenegger inspired the character and co-developed it with Stan Lee, who would have produced the series. Schwarzenegger would have voiced the Governator.On May 20, 2011, Schwarzenegger's entertainment counsel announced that all film projects currently in development were being halted: \"Schwarzenegger is focusing on personal matters and is not willing to commit to any production schedules or timelines.\" On July 11, 2011, it was announced that Schwarzenegger was considering a comeback film, despite the legal problems related to his divorce. He appeared in The Expendables 2 (2012), and starred in The Last Stand (2013), his first leading role in 10 years, and Escape Plan (2013), his first co-starring role alongside Sylvester Stallone. He starred in Sabotage, released in March 2014, and appeared in The Expendables 3, released in August 2014. He starred in the fifth Terminator film Terminator Genisys in 2015, and would reprise his role as Conan the Barbarian in The Legend of Conan, later renamed Conan the Conqueror. However, in April 2017, producer Chris Morgan stated that Universal had dropped the project, although there was a possibility of a TV show. The story of the film was supposed to be set 30 years after the first, with some inspiration from Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven.In August 2016, his filming of action-comedy Why We're Killing Gunther was temporarily interrupted by bank robbers near filming location in Surrey, British Columbia. He was announced to star and produce in a film about the ruins of Sanxingdui called The Guest of Sanxingdui, as an ambassador.On February 6, 2018, Amazon Studios announced they were working with Schwarzenegger to develop a new series entitled Outrider in which he will star and executive produce. The western-drama set in the Oklahoma Indian Territory in the late 19th century will follow a deputy (portrayed by Schwarzenegger) who is tasked with apprehending a legendary outlaw in the wilderness, but is forced to partner with a ruthless Federal Marshal to make sure justice is properly served. The series will also mark as Schwarzenegger's first major scripted TV role.Schwarzenegger returned to the Terminator franchise with Terminator: Dark Fate, which was released on November 1, 2019. It was produced by the series' co-creator James Cameron, who directed him previously in the first two films in the series and in True Lies. It was shot in Almer\u00eda, Hungary and the US.\n\n\n=== The Celebrity Apprentice ===\nIn September 2015, the media announced that Schwarzenegger was to replace Donald Trump as host of The New Celebrity Apprentice. This show, the 15th season of The Apprentice, aired during the 2016\u20132017 TV season. In the show, he used the phrases \"you're terminated\" and \"get to the choppa\", which are quotes from some of his famous roles (The Terminator and Predator, respectively), when firing the contestants.In March 2017, following repeated criticisms from Trump, Schwarzenegger announced that he would not return for another season on the show. He also reacted to Trump's remarks in January 2017 via Instagram: \"Hey, Donald, I have a great idea. Why don't we switch jobs? You take over TV because you're such an expert in ratings, and I take over your job, and then people can finally sleep comfortably again.\"\n\n\n=== Filmography ===\n\n\n== Political career ==\n\n\n=== Early politics ===\n\nSchwarzenegger has been a registered Republican for many years. When he was an  actor, his political views were always well known as they contrasted with those of many other prominent Hollywood stars, who are generally considered to be a liberal and Democratic-leaning community. At the 2004 Republican National Convention, Schwarzenegger gave a speech and explained he was a Republican because the Democrats of the 1960s sounded too much like Austrian socialists.\nI finally arrived here in 1968. What a special day it was. I remember I arrived here with empty pockets but full of dreams, full of determination, full of desire. The presidential campaign was in full swing. I remember watching the Nixon\u2013Humphrey presidential race on TV. A friend of mine who spoke German and English translated for me. I heard Humphrey saying things that sounded like socialism, which I had just left.\nBut then I heard Nixon speak. He was talking about free enterprise, getting the government off your back, lowering the taxes and strengthening the military. Listening to Nixon speak sounded more like a breath of fresh air. I said to my friend, I said, \"What party is he?\" My friend said, \"He's a Republican.\" I said, \"Then I am a Republican.\" And I have been a Republican ever since.\n\nIn 1985, Schwarzenegger appeared in \"Stop the Madness\", an anti-drug music video sponsored by the Reagan administration. He first came to wide public notice as a Republican during the 1988 presidential election, accompanying then\u2013Vice President George H. W. Bush at a campaign rally.Schwarzenegger's first political appointment was as chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, on which he served from 1990 to 1993. He was nominated by George H. W. Bush, who dubbed him \"Conan the Republican\". He later served as chairman for the California Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports under Governor Pete Wilson.\nBetween 1993 and 1994, Schwarzenegger was a Red Cross ambassador (a ceremonial role fulfilled by celebrities), recording several television and radio public service announcements to donate blood.\nIn an interview with Talk magazine in late 1999, Schwarzenegger was asked if he thought of running for office. He replied, \"I think about it many times. The possibility is there because I feel it inside.\" The Hollywood Reporter claimed shortly after that Schwarzenegger sought to end speculation that he might run for governor of California Following his initial comments, Schwarzenegger said, \"I'm in show business \u2013 I am in the middle of my career. Why would I go away from that and jump into something else?\"\n\n\n=== Governor of California ===\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger is a moderate Republican. He says he is fiscally conservative and socially liberal. On the issue of abortion, he describes himself as pro-choice, but supports  parental notification for minors and a ban on partial-birth abortion. He has supported gay rights, such as domestic partnerships, and he performed a same-sex marriage as Governor.Schwarzenegger announced his candidacy in the 2003 California recall election for Governor of California on the August 6, 2003, episode of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Schwarzenegger had the most name recognition in a crowded field of candidates, but he had never held public office and his political views were unknown to most Californians. His candidacy immediately became national and international news, with media outlets dubbing him the \"Governator\" (referring to The Terminator movies, see above) and \"The Running Man\" (the name of another one of his films), and calling the recall election \"Total Recall\" (yet another movie starring Schwarzenegger). Schwarzenegger declined to participate in several debates with other recall replacement candidates, and appeared in only one debate on September 24, 2003.\n\nOn October 7, 2003, the recall election resulted in Governor Gray Davis being removed from office with 55.4% of the Yes vote in favor of a recall. Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California under the second question on the ballot with 48.6% of the vote to choose a successor to Davis. Schwarzenegger defeated Democrat Cruz Bustamante, fellow Republican Tom McClintock, and others. His nearest rival, Bustamante, received 31% of the vote. In total, Schwarzenegger won the election by about 1.3 million votes. Under the regulations of the California Constitution, no runoff election was required. Schwarzenegger was the second foreign-born governor of California after Irish-born Governor John G. Downey in 1862.\nSchwarzenegger was entrenched in what he considered to be his mandate in cleaning up political gridlock. Building on a catchphrase from the sketch \"Hans and Franz\" from Saturday Night Live (which partly parodied his bodybuilding career), Schwarzenegger called the Democratic State politicians \"girlie men\".Schwarzenegger's early victories included repealing an unpopular increase in the vehicle registration fee as well as preventing driver's licenses from being given out to illegal immigrants, but later he began to feel the backlash when powerful state unions began to oppose his various initiatives. Key among his reckoning with political realities was a special election he called in November 2005, in which four ballot measures he sponsored were defeated. Schwarzenegger accepted personal responsibility for the defeats and vowed to continue to seek consensus for the people of California. He would later comment that \"no one could win if the opposition raised 160 million dollars to defeat you\".  The U.S. Supreme Court later found the public employee unions' use of compulsory fundraising during the campaign had been illegal in Knox v. Service Employees International Union, Local 1000.\n\nSchwarzenegger, against the advice of fellow Republican strategists, appointed a Democrat, Susan Kennedy, as his Chief of Staff. He gradually moved towards a more politically moderate position, determined to build a winning legacy with only a short time to go until the next gubernatorial election.\nSchwarzenegger ran for re-election against Democrat Phil Angelides, the California State Treasurer, in the 2006 elections, held on November 7, 2006. Despite a poor year nationally for the Republican party, Schwarzenegger won re-election with 56.0% of the vote compared with 38.9% for Angelides, a margin of well over 1 million votes. Around this time, many commentators saw Schwarzenegger as moving away from the right and towards the center of the political spectrum. After hearing a speech by Schwarzenegger at the 2006 Martin Luther King Jr. Day breakfast, in which Schwarzenegger said, in part \"How wrong I was when I said everyone has an equal opportunity to make it in America [...] the state of California does not provide (equal) education for all of our children\", San Francisco mayor & future governor of California Gavin Newsom said that \"[H]e's becoming a Democrat [... H]e's running back, not even to the center. I would say center-left\".Some speculated that Schwarzenegger might run for the United States Senate in 2010, as his governorship would be term-limited by that time. Such rumors turned out to be false.\n\nWendy Leigh, who wrote an unofficial biography on Schwarzenegger, claims he plotted his political rise from an early age using the movie business and bodybuilding as the means to escape a depressing home. Leigh portrays Schwarzenegger as obsessed with power and quotes him as saying, \"I wanted to be part of the small percentage of people who were leaders, not the large mass of followers. I think it is because I saw leaders use 100% of their potential \u2013 I was always fascinated by people in control of other people.\" Schwarzenegger has said that it was never his intention to enter politics, but he says, \"I married into a political family. You get together with them and you hear about policy, about reaching out to help people. I was exposed to the idea of being a public servant and Eunice and Sargent Shriver became my heroes.\" Eunice Kennedy Shriver was the sister of John F. Kennedy, and mother-in-law to Schwarzenegger; Sargent Shriver is husband to Eunice and father-in-law to Schwarzenegger.\nSchwarzenegger cannot run for U.S. President as he is not a natural-born citizen of the United States. Schwarzenegger is a dual Austrian and United States citizen. He has held Austrian citizenship since birth and U.S. citizenship since becoming naturalized in 1983. Being Austrian and thus European, he was able to win the 2007 European Voice campaigner of the year award for taking action against climate change with the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 and plans to introduce an emissions trading scheme with other US states and possibly with the EU.\n\nBecause of his personal wealth from his acting career, Schwarzenegger did not accept his governor's salary of $175,000 per year.Schwarzenegger's endorsement in the Republican primary of the 2008 U.S. presidential election was highly sought; despite being good friends with candidates Rudy Giuliani and Senator John McCain, Schwarzenegger remained neutral throughout 2007 and early 2008. Giuliani dropped out of the presidential race on January 30, 2008, largely because of a poor showing in Florida, and endorsed McCain. Later that night, Schwarzenegger was in the audience at a Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. The following day, he endorsed McCain, joking, \"It's Rudy's fault!\" (in reference to his friendships with both candidates and that he could not make up his mind). Schwarzenegger's endorsement was thought to be a boost for Senator McCain's campaign; both spoke about their concerns for the environment and economy.In its April 2010 report, Progressive ethics watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington named Schwarzenegger one of 11 \"worst governors\" in the United States because of various ethics issues throughout Schwarzenegger's term as governor.Governor Schwarzenegger played a significant role in opposing Proposition 66, a proposed amendment of the Californian Three Strikes Law, in November 2004. This amendment would have required the third felony to be either violent or serious to mandate a 25-years-to-life sentence. In the last week before the ballot, Schwarzenegger launched an intensive campaign against Proposition 66. He stated that \"it would release 26,000 dangerous criminals and rapists\".Although he began his tenure as governor with record high approval ratings (as high as 65% in May 2004), he left office with a record low 23%, only one percent higher than that of Gray Davis, when he was recalled in October 2003.\n\n\n==== Death of Louis Santos ====\n\nIn May 2010, Esteban N\u00fa\u00f1ez pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 16 years in prison for the death of Louis Santos. N\u00fa\u00f1ez is the son of Fabian N\u00fa\u00f1ez, then California Assembly Speaker of the House and a close friend and staunch political ally of then governor Schwarzenegger.As a personal favor to \"a friend\", just hours before he left office, and as one of his last official acts, Schwarzenegger commuted N\u00fa\u00f1ez's sentence by more than half, to seven years. Against protocol, Schwarzenegger did not inform Santos' family or the San Diego County prosecutors about the commutation. They learned about it in a call from a reporter.The Santos family, along with the San Diego district attorney, sued to stop the commutation, claiming that it violated Marsy's Law. In September 2012, Sacramento County superior court judge Lloyd Connelly stated, \"Based on the evidentiary records before this court involving this case, there was an abuse of discretion...This was a distasteful commutation. It was repugnant to the bulk of the citizenry of this state.\" However, Connelly ruled that Schwarzenegger remained within his executive powers as governor. Subsequently, as a direct result of the way the commutation was handled, Governor Jerry Brown signed a bipartisan bill that allows offender's victims and their families to be notified at least 10 days before any commutations. N\u00fa\u00f1ez was released from prison after serving less than six years.\n\n\n=== Allegations of sexual misconduct and drug use ===\n\nDuring his initial campaign for governor in 2003, allegations of sexual and personal misconduct were raised against Schwarzenegger. Within the last five days before the election, news reports appeared in the Los Angeles Times recounting allegations of sexual misconduct from several individual women, six of whom eventually came forward with their personal stories. Three of the women claimed he had grabbed their breasts, a fourth said he placed his hand under her skirt on her buttock. A fifth woman claimed Schwarzenegger tried to take off her bathing suit in a hotel elevator, and the last said he pulled her onto his lap and asked her about a sex act.Schwarzenegger replied in 2004 that he has \"behaved badly sometimes\" and apologized, but also stated that \"a lot of [what] you see in the stories is not true\". This led to a resurfacing of an interview in adult magazine Oui from 1977, in which Schwarzenegger discussed attending sexual orgies and using substances such as marijuana. Schwarzenegger is shown smoking a marijuana joint after winning Mr. Olympia in the 1975 documentary film Pumping Iron. In an interview with GQ magazine in October 2007, Schwarzenegger said, \"[Marijuana] is not a drug. It's a leaf. My drug was pumping iron, trust me.\" His spokesperson later said the comment was meant to be a joke.British television personality Anna Richardson settled a libel lawsuit in August 2006 against Schwarzenegger, his top aide, Sean Walsh, and his publicist, Sheryl Main. A joint statement read: \"The parties are content to put this matter behind them and are pleased that this legal dispute has now been settled.\" Richardson claimed they tried to tarnish her reputation by dismissing her allegations that Schwarzenegger touched her breast during a press event for The 6th Day in London. She claimed Walsh and Main libeled her in a Los Angeles Times article when they contended she encouraged his behavior.\n\n\n=== Citizenship ===\n\nSchwarzenegger became a naturalized U.S. citizen on September 17, 1983. Shortly before he gained his citizenship, he asked the Austrian authorities for the right to keep his Austrian citizenship, as Austria does not usually allow dual citizenship. His request was granted, and he retained his Austrian citizenship. In 2005, Peter Pilz, a member of the Austrian Parliament from the Austrian Green Party, unsuccessfully advocated for Parliament to revoke Schwarzenegger's Austrian citizenship due to his decision not to prevent the executions of Donald Beardslee and Stanley Williams. Pilz argued that Schwarzenegger caused damage to Austria's reputation in the international community because Austria abolished the death penalty in 1968. Pilz based his argument on Article 33 of the Austrian Citizenship Act, which states: \"A citizen, who is in the public service of a foreign country, shall be deprived of his citizenship if he heavily damages the reputation or the interests of the Austrian Republic.\" Pilz claimed that Schwarzenegger's actions in support of the death penalty (prohibited in Austria under Protocol 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights) had damaged Austria's reputation. Schwarzenegger explained his actions by pointing out that his only duty as Governor of California with respect to the death penalty was to correct an error by the justice system by pardon or clemency if such an error had occurred.\n\n\n=== Environmental record ===\nOn September 27, 2006, Schwarzenegger signed the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, creating the nation's first cap on greenhouse gas emissions. The law set new regulations on the amount of emissions utilities, refineries, and manufacturing plants are allowed to release into the atmosphere. Schwarzenegger also signed a second global warming bill that prohibits large utilities and corporations in California from making long-term contracts with suppliers who do not meet the state's greenhouse gas emission standards. The two bills are part of a plan to reduce California's emissions by 25 percent to 1990s levels by 2020. In 2005, Schwarzenegger issued an executive order calling to reduce greenhouse gases to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.Schwarzenegger signed another executive order on October 17, 2006, allowing California to work with the Northeast's Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. They plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by issuing a limited amount of carbon credits to each power plant in participating states. Any power plants that exceed emissions for the number of carbon credits will have to purchase more credits to cover the difference. The plan took effect in 2009. In addition to using his political power to fight global warming, the governor has taken steps at his home to reduce his personal carbon footprint. Schwarzenegger has adapted one of his Hummers to run on hydrogen and another to run on biofuels. He has also installed solar panels to heat his home.In respect for his contribution to the direction of the US motor industry, Schwarzenegger was invited to open the 2009 SAE World Congress in Detroit, on April 20, 2009.In 2011, Schwarzenegger founded the R20 Regions of Climate Action to develop a sustainable, low-carbon economy.\n\n\n=== Electoral history ===\n\n\n=== Presidential ambitions ===\nThe Equal Opportunity to Govern Amendment in 2003 was widely accredited as the \"Amend for Arnold\" bill, which would have added an amendment to the U.S. Constitution allowing his run, as he was not a natural born citizen. In 2004, the \"Amend for Arnold\" campaign was launched, featuring a website and TV advertising promotion.In June 2007, Schwarzenegger was featured on the cover of TIME magazine with Michael Bloomberg, and subsequently, the two joked about a Presidential ticket together.In October 2013, the New York Post reported that Schwarzenegger was exploring a future run for president. The former California governor would face a constitutional hurdle; Article II, Section I, Clause V prevents individuals who are not natural-born citizens of the United States from assuming the office. He has reportedly been lobbying legislators about a possible constitutional change, or filing a legal challenge to the provision. Columbia University law professor Michael Dorf observed that Schwarzenegger's possible lawsuit could ultimately win him the right to run for the office, noting, \"The law is very clear, but it's not 100 percent clear that the courts would enforce that law rather than leave it to the political process.\"\n\n\n== Business career ==\nSchwarzenegger has had a highly successful business career. Following his move to the United States, Schwarzenegger became a \"prolific goal setter\" and would write his objectives at the start of the year on index cards, like starting a mail order business or buying a new car \u2013 and succeed in doing so. By the age of 30, Schwarzenegger was a millionaire, well before his career in Hollywood. His financial independence came from his success as a budding entrepreneur with a series of lucrative business ventures and investments.\n\n\n=== Bricklaying business ===\nIn 1968, Schwarzenegger and fellow bodybuilder Franco Columbu started a bricklaying business. The business flourished thanks to the pair's marketing savvy and an increased demand following the 1971 San Fernando earthquake. Schwarzenegger and Columbu used profits from their bricklaying venture to start a mail-order business, selling bodybuilding and fitness-related equipment and instructional tapes.\n\n\n=== Investments ===\nSchwarzenegger transferred profits from the mail-order business and his bodybuilding-competition winnings into his first real estate investment venture: an apartment building he purchased for $10,000. He would later go on to invest in a number of real estate holding companies.Schwarzenegger was a founding celebrity investor in the Planet Hollywood chain of international theme restaurants (modeled after the Hard Rock Cafe) along with Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone and Demi Moore. Schwarzenegger severed his financial ties with the business in early 2000. Schwarzenegger said the company had not had the success he had hoped for, claiming he wanted to focus his attention on \"new US global business ventures\" and his movie career.He also invested in a shopping mall in Columbus, Ohio. He has talked about some of those who have helped him over the years in business: \"I couldn't have learned about business without a parade of teachers guiding me... from Milton Friedman to Donald Trump... and now, Les Wexner and Warren Buffett. I even learned a thing or two from Planet Hollywood, such as when to get out! And I did!\" He has significant ownership in Dimensional Fund Advisors, an investment firm. Schwarzenegger is also the owner of Arnold's Sports Festival, which he started in 1989 and is held annually in Columbus, Ohio. It is a festival that hosts thousands of international health and fitness professionals which has also expanded into a three-day expo. He also owns a movie production company called Oak Productions, Inc. and Fitness Publications, a joint publishing venture with Simon & Schuster.\n\n\n=== Restaurant ===\nIn 1992, Schwarzenegger and his wife opened a restaurant in Santa Monica called Schatzi On Main. Schatzi literally means \"little treasure,\" and colloquially \"honey\" or \"darling\" in German. In 1998, he sold his restaurant.\n\n\n=== Wealth ===\n\nSchwarzenegger's net worth had been conservatively estimated at $100 million to $200 million. After separating from his wife, Maria Shriver, in 2011, it has been estimated that his net worth has been approximately $400 million, and even as high as $800 million, based on tax returns he filed in 2006.Over the years, he invested his bodybuilding and film earnings in an array of stocks, bonds, privately controlled companies, and real estate holdings worldwide, making his net worth as an accurate estimation difficult to calculate, particularly in light of declining real estate values owing to economic recessions in the U.S. and Europe since the late 2000s. In June 1997, Schwarzenegger spent $38 million of his own money on a private Gulfstream jet. Schwarzenegger once said of his fortune, \"Money doesn't make you happy. I now have $50 million, but I was just as happy when I had $48 million.\"\n\n\n=== Commercial advertisements ===\nHe appears in a series of commercials for the Machine Zone game Mobile Strike as a military commander and spokesman.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n\n=== Early relationships ===\n\nIn 1969, Schwarzenegger met Barbara Outland (later Barbara Outland Baker), an English teacher with whom he lived until 1974. Schwarzenegger said of Baker in his 1977 memoir, \"Basically it came down to this: she was a well-balanced woman who wanted an ordinary, solid life, and I was not a well-balanced man, and hated the very idea of ordinary life.\" Baker has described Schwarzenegger as a \"joyful personality, totally charismatic, adventurous, and athletic\" but claims that towards the end of the relationship he became \"insufferable\u2014classically conceited\u2014the world revolved around him\". Baker published her memoir in 2006, entitled Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak. Although Baker painted an unflattering portrait of her former lover at times, Schwarzenegger actually contributed to the tell-all book with a foreword, and also met with Baker for three hours.Baker claims that she only learned of his being unfaithful after they split, and talks of a turbulent and passionate love life. Schwarzenegger has made it clear that their respective recollection of events can differ. The couple first met six to eight months after his arrival in the U.S. Their first date was watching the first Apollo Moon landing on television. They shared an apartment in Santa Monica, California, for three and a half years, and having little money, they would visit the beach all day or have barbecues in the back yard. Although Baker claims that when she first met Schwarzenegger, he had \"little understanding of polite society\" and she found him a turn-off, she says, \"He's as much a self-made man as it's possible to be\u2014he never got encouragement from his parents, his family, his brother. He just had this huge determination to prove himself, and that was very attractive ... I'll go to my grave knowing Arnold loved me.\"Schwarzenegger met his next lover, Beverly Hills hairdresser's assistant Sue Moray, on Venice Beach in July 1977. According to Moray, the couple led an open relationship: \"We were faithful when we were both in LA... but when he was out of town, we were free to do whatever we wanted.\" Schwarzenegger met television journalist Maria Shriver, niece of President John F. Kennedy, at the Robert F. Kennedy Tennis Tournament in August 1977. He went on to have a relationship with both Moray and Shriver until August 1978, when Moray (who knew of his relationship with Shriver) issued an ultimatum.\n\n\n=== Marriage and family ===\nOn April 26, 1986, Schwarzenegger married Shriver in Hyannis, Massachusetts. The Rev. John Baptist Riordan performed the ceremony at St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church. They have four children: Katherine Eunice Schwarzenegger (born December 13, 1989), Christina Maria Aurelia Schwarzenegger (born July 23, 1991), Patrick Arnold Shriver Schwarzenegger (born September 18, 1993), and Christopher Sargent Shriver Schwarzenegger (born September 27, 1997). All of their children were born in Los Angeles. The family lived in a 11,000-square-foot (1,000 m2) home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, with vacation homes in Sun Valley, Idaho and Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. They attended St. Monica's Catholic Church.\n\n\n==== Divorce ====\n\nOn May 9, 2011, Shriver and Schwarzenegger ended their relationship after 25 years of marriage, with Shriver moving out of the couple's Brentwood mansion. On May 16, 2011, the Los Angeles Times revealed that Schwarzenegger had fathered a son more than 14 years earlier with an employee in their household, Mildred Patricia \"Patty\" Baena. \"After leaving the governor's office I told my wife about this event, which occurred over a decade ago,\" Schwarzenegger said in a statement issued to The Times. In the statement, Schwarzenegger did not mention that he had confessed to his wife only after she had confronted him with the information, which she had done after confirming with the housekeeper what she had suspected about the child.Baena is of Guatemalan origin. She was employed by the family for 20 years and retired in January 2011. The pregnant Baena was working in the home while Shriver was pregnant with the youngest of the couple's four children. Baena's son with Schwarzenegger, Joseph, was born on October 2, 1997, and Shriver gave birth to Christopher a few days before on September 27, 1997. Schwarzenegger says it took seven or eight years before he found out that he had fathered a child with his housekeeper. It was not until the boy \"started looking like [him] ... that [he] put things together\". Schwarzenegger has taken financial responsibility for the child \"from the start and continued to provide support\". KNX 1070 radio reported that in 2010 he bought a new four-bedroom house with a pool for Baena and their son in Bakersfield, California. Baena separated from her husband, Rogelio, a few months after Joseph's birth. She filed for divorce in 2008. Rogelio says that the child's birth certificate was falsified and that he planned to sue Schwarzenegger for engaging in conspiracy to falsify a public document, a serious crime in California.Pursuant to the divorce judgment, Schwarzenegger kept the Brentwood home, while Shriver purchased a new home nearby so that the children could travel between their parents' homes. They shared custody of the two youngest children. Schwarzenegger came under fire after the initial petition did not include spousal support and a reimbursement of attorney's fees. However, he claims this was not intentional and that he signed the initial documents without having properly read them. He filed amended divorce papers remedying this. Schwarzenegger and Shriver finalized their divorce in 2017, six years after separating.After the scandal, Danish-Italian actress Brigitte Nielsen came forward and stated that she too had an affair with Schwarzenegger during the production of Red Sonja, while he had just started his relationship with Shriver, saying, \"Maybe I wouldn't have got into it if he said 'I'm going to marry Maria' and this is deadly serious, but he didn't, and our affair carried on.\" When asked in January 2014, \"Of all the things you are famous for ... which are you least proud of?\" Schwarzenegger replied, \"I'm least proud of the mistakes I made that caused my family pain and split us up.\"As of July 2015, Schwarzenegger was dating physical therapist Heather Milligan, 27 years his junior.\n\n\n=== Accidents and injuries ===\nSchwarzenegger was born with a bicuspid aortic valve, an aortic valve with only two leaflets (a normal aortic valve has three leaflets). He opted in 1997 for a replacement heart valve made of his own transplanted tissue; medical experts predicted he would require heart valve replacement surgery in the following two to eight years as his valve would progressively degrade. Schwarzenegger apparently opted against a mechanical valve, the only permanent solution available at the time of his surgery, because it would have sharply limited his physical activity and capacity to exercise. On March 29, 2018, Schwarzenegger underwent emergency open-heart surgery. He said about his recovery: \"I underwent open-heart surgery this spring, I had to use a walker. I had to do breathing exercises five times a day to retrain my lungs. I was frustrated and angry, and in my worst moments, I couldn't see the way back to my old self.\"On December 9, 2001, he broke six ribs and was hospitalized for four days after a motorcycle crash in Los Angeles.Schwarzenegger saved a drowning man's life in 2004 while on vacation in Hawaii by swimming out and bringing him back to shore.On January 8, 2006, while Schwarzenegger was riding his Harley Davidson motorcycle in Los Angeles, with his son Patrick in the sidecar, another driver backed into the street he was riding on, causing him and his son to collide with the car at a low speed. While his son and the other driver were unharmed, Schwarzenegger sustained a minor injury to his lip, requiring 15 stitches. \"No citations were issued,\" said Officer Jason Lee, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman. Schwarzenegger did not obtain his motorcycle license until July 3, 2006.Schwarzenegger tripped over his ski pole and broke his right femur while skiing in Sun Valley, Idaho, with his family on December 23, 2006. On December 26, he underwent a 90-minute operation in which cables and screws were used to wire the broken bone back together. He was released from St. John's Health Center on December 30, 2006.Schwarzenegger's private jet made an emergency landing at Van Nuys Airport on June 19, 2009, after the pilot reported smoke coming from the cockpit, according to a statement released by his press secretary. No one was harmed in the incident.On May 18, 2019, while on a visit to South Africa, Schwarzenegger was attacked, drop-kicked from behind by an unknown malefactor, while giving autographs to his fans at one of the local schools. Despite the surprise and unprovoked nature of the attack, he reportedly suffered no injuries and continued to interact with fans. The attacker was apprehended and Schwarzenegger declined to press charges against him.\n\n\n=== Height ===\nSchwarzenegger's official height of 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) has been brought into question by several articles. In his bodybuilding days in the late 1960s, he was measured to be 6 ft 1.5 in (1.867 m), a height confirmed by his fellow bodybuilders. However, in 1988, both the Daily Mail and Time Out magazine mentioned that Schwarzenegger appeared noticeably shorter. Prior to running for governor, Schwarzenegger's height was once again questioned in an article by the Chicago Reader. As governor, Schwarzenegger engaged in a light-hearted exchange with Assemblyman Herb Wesson over their heights. At one point, Wesson made an unsuccessful attempt to, in his own words, \"settle this once and for all and find out how tall he is\" by using a tailor's tape measure on the Governor. Schwarzenegger retaliated by placing a pillow stitched with the words \"Need a lift?\" on the five-foot-five-inch (1.65 m) Wesson's chair before a negotiating session in his office. Bob Mulholland also claimed Schwarzenegger was 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m) and that he wore risers in his boots. In 1999, Men's Health magazine stated his height was 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m).\n\n\n=== Autobiography ===\nSchwarzenegger's autobiography, Total Recall, was released in October 2012. He devotes one chapter called \"The Secret\" to his extramarital affair. The majority of his book is about his successes in the three major chapters in his life: bodybuilder, actor, and Governor of California.\n\n\n=== Vehicles ===\nGrowing up during the Allied occupation of Austria, Schwarzenegger commonly saw heavy military vehicles such as tanks as a child. As a result, he paid $20,000 in order to bring his Austrian Army M47 Patton tank (331) to the United States, which he previously operated during his mandatory service in 1965. However, he later obtained his vehicle in 1991/2, during his tenure as the Chairmen of the President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition, and now uses it to support his charity. His first car ever was an Opel Kadett in 1969 after serving in the Austrian army, then he rode a Harley-Davidson Fat Boy in 1991.Moreover, he came to develop an interest in large vehicles and became the first civilian in the U.S. to purchase a Humvee. He was so enamored by the vehicle that he lobbied the Humvee's manufacturer, AM General, to produce a street-legal, civilian version, which they did in 1992; the first two Hummer H1s they sold were also purchased by Schwarzenegger. In 2010, he had one regular and three running on non-fossil power sources; one for hydrogen, one for vegetable oil, and one for biodiesel. Schwarzenegger was in the news in 2014 for buying a rare Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse. He was spotted and filmed in 2015 in his car, painted silver with bright aluminum forged wheels. His Bugatti has its interior adorned in dark brown leather. In 2017, Schwarzenegger acquired a Mercedes G-Class modified for all-electric drive.The Hummers that Schwarzenegger bought in 1992 are so large\u2014each weighs 6,300 lb (2,900 kg) and is 7 feet (2.1 m) wide\u2014that they are classified as large trucks, and U.S. fuel economy regulations do not apply to them. During the gubernatorial recall campaign, he announced that he would convert one of his Hummers to burn hydrogen. The conversion was reported to have cost about $21,000. After the election, he signed an executive order to jump-start the building of hydrogen refueling plants called the California Hydrogen Highway Network, and gained a U.S. Department of Energy grant to help pay for its projected US$91,000,000 cost. California took delivery of the first H2H (Hydrogen Hummer) in October 2004.\n\n\n== Public image ==\n\nSchwarzenegger has been involved with the Special Olympics for many years after they were founded by his ex-mother-in-law, Eunice Kennedy Shriver. In 2007, Schwarzenegger was the official spokesperson for the Special Olympics which were held in Shanghai, China. Schwarzenegger believes that quality school opportunities should be made available to children who might not normally be able to access them. In 1995, he founded the Inner City Games Foundation (ICG) which provides cultural, educational and community enrichment programming to youth. ICG is active in 15 cities around the country and serves over 250,000 children in over 400 schools countrywide. He has also been involved with After-School All-Stars and founded the Los Angeles branch in 2002. ASAS is an after school program provider, educating youth about health, fitness and nutrition.\nOn February 12, 2010, Schwarzenegger took part in the Vancouver Olympic Torch relay. He handed off the flame to the next runner, Sebastian Coe.Schwarzenegger had a collection of Marxist busts, which he requested from Russian friends at the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, as they were being destroyed. In 2011, he revealed that his wife had requested their removal, but he kept the one of Vladimir Lenin present, since \"he was the first\". In 2015, he said he kept the Lenin bust to \"show losers\".Schwarzenegger is a supporter of Israel, and has participated in a Los Angeles pro-Israel rally among other similar events.\n\nSchwarzenegger supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Schwarzenegger also expressed support for the 2011 military intervention in Libya. Schwarzenegger released a video message supporting protests against Ukraine's pro-Russian President Victor Yanukovych.Schwarzenegger, who played football as a boy, grew up watching Bayern Munich and Sturm Graz. He also expressed his admiration of J\u00fcrgen Klopp's Liverpool in October 2019.\n\n\n=== Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy ===\nIn 2012, Schwarzenegger helped to found the Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy, which is a part of the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy at the University of Southern California. The Institute's mission is to \"[advance] post-partisanship, where leaders put people over political parties and work together to find the best ideas and solutions to benefit the people they serve\" and to \"seek to influence public policy and public debate in finding solutions to the serious challenges we face\". Schwarzenegger serves as chairman of the Institute.\n\n\n=== Global warming ===\nAt a 2015 security conference, Arnold Schwarzenegger called climate change the issue of our time. He also urged politicians to stop treating climate change as a political issue.\n\n\n=== 2016 Presidential election ===\nFor the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, Schwarzenegger endorsed fellow Republican John Kasich. However, he announced in October that he would not vote for the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in that year's United States presidential election, with this being the first time he did not vote for the Republican candidate since becoming a citizen in 1983.\n\n\n=== Post 2016 ===\nIn recent years Schwarzenegger has been advocating for eating less meat, and he is an executive producer alongside James Cameron et al. behind the documentary The Game Changers, that documents the explosive rise of plant-based eating in professional sports, in which he is also featured.\nIn 2017, Schwarzenegger condemned white supremacists who were seen carrying Nazi and Confederate flags, by calling their heroes \"losers\".In 2019, while at the \"Arnold Classic Africa\" sports competition as an official, Schwarzenegger was attacked by an assailant in a flying kick. The assailant was arrested.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n\nSeven-time Mr. Olympia winner\nFour-time Mr. Universe winner\n1969 World Amateur Bodybuilding Champion\n1977 Golden Globe Award winner\nMedal for Humanitary Merit of the Austrian Albert Schweitzer Society (2011)\nStar on the Hollywood Walk of Fame\nInternational Sports Hall of Fame (class of 2012)\npublic art mural portrait \"Arnold Schwarzenegger\" (2012) by Jonas Never, Venice, Los Angeles\nWWE Hall of Fame (class of 2015)\nSchwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy (part of the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy at the University of Southern California) named in his honor.\nArnold's Run ski trail at Sun Valley Resort named in his honor.

          "Because I use Arnold's Encyclopedia of Bodybuilding...",
          "This museum might be small, but still has a lot to offer, especially if you're a die hard Schwarzenegger fan. No matter if you've looked up to him as a body builder, as an actor or the \"governator\", you'll definitely find some memorabilia \u2026",
          "The museum is located in Arnold's family home that is why it is very small. On the other hand in each room there is quite a lot of old Arnold's stuff and photos that he has put there. Nevertheless I think that he could took a little more \u2026",
          "I didn\u2019t go in because they charge \u20ac9 for entry.\nThat is super expensive for the average Austrian income. So they leave their own people without financial means to pay for entry. I don\u2019t think that is fair.",

I think it's too small for the price you pay but you should definetly go if you're a fan. It's one of the weirdest museums I've ever visited, that's for sure",

          "Very interesting: Even as I am not an AS fan I have to admit he is a very inspiring personality. And you would not fully understand this until you saw this place and met people who know him personally. Unfortunaly we missed his visit (with his daughter) here off just a few",
          "It was amazing well worth the trip!!! We stayed in veinna and few people said its too far away but if u give yourself plenty of time you'll do it... it's a must! The lady working there knew so much about him and answered all our questions. You can stay in there as long as you",

          "Went to Thal in Graz today to visit Arnold Schwarzenegger's Museum which was his house growing up. Not only is it in a beautiful village but it was very fun and enjoyable. I went with a friend who was really excited and loves Arnold and as someone who wasn't quite at that",
          "We travelled over 6 hours to see this museum and I would do it all over again!! It was absolutely fantastic to roam around Arnold's birth village, visit the Thalersee and see his birth house. The museum is very cosy and super interesting. The wonderful staff was very friendly,",

          "Located less than 2 hours outside Vienna this small museum dedicated to the life of Arnold Schwarzenegger is absolutely a must see for any fan. The sheer amount of memorabilia is amazing. I got to hold the sword from Conan the Barbarian as well as sit on the Harley from",
          "One does not even have to be Arnie's fan to enjoy this museum. But if you are, then you will have one great experience from this. All the memories coming up while walking through exposition!",
          "What an awesome place to visit! Whether you are a big Arnie fan or not this place is just cool. Some great things to see and very informative! Well worth a visit!!",
          "Warning: This is a biased review because I am an Arnie fan. The visit was an inspiration. From this very humble origin, this home, in the little village of Thal, outside Graz, Arnie has gone on to conquer Hollywood and then even Governor of California. He is living proof of",
          "Caught the number 40 bus from Jakomini-platz in Graz center which went to Gosting, then onto the bus stop near to the Thalersee restaurant. The museum was then only 5 minutes walk up the hill from there. So really easy to get to. Thal is very quiet and peaceful, and the locals",
          "Great place to visit for an arnie fan! It was our reason for visiting the City of Graz...the 4km walk was beautiful! The Museum was totally worth the journey! The woman who works there was amazing too, so polite and enthusiastic...she even treated us to a free beer each after we",
          "So bummed that the museum was closed when we arrived\u2026We still enjoyed the grounds and taking photos in front of the excellent sculpture. The town of Thal is very charming\u2026you can even visit the lake where Arnold proposed marriage to Maria...",
          "Went here on Arnie Birthday July 30 - 2015 Must say was really worth the effort coming all the way from Ireland Really cool to be at his actually house and the town he grew up what was awesome there was a stung man competition going on some austrian guy beat a record",
          "You don't need to be an Arnie fan to enjoy this quaint museum. We made a special trip from Vienna as my son was very keen to visit and we were not disappointed. Lots of memorabilia from his weightlifting, acting and political careers - he's quite an interesting guy.",
          "A must for any Arnie fans! There is a vast amount to see given the intimate size of the house. All sorts of items covering his first work out equipment, army life, movie and political careers! My favorites where the T2 Harley, statues and Governors Desk! The host was very",
          "It's always neat to visit private houses as you get a glimpse of the intimacy and energy of past family life. It's got some awesome memorabilia from Arnold's youth and movie life. The house itself is so cute, the old kitchen, the rooms - they all teleported me to the 50s and 60s",
          "For so many years it was my dream to visit Arnie's home, and it finally came true!!! This museum is in the middle of nowhere - you have to take 2 buses from Graz and then go along the road, then uphill, but it's worth it! Even rainy weather didn't stop me! (and we were only 2",
          "I am a huge Arnold fan and visiting his childhood home now museum was a great detour on our trip across Austria. I will say that the museum is a bit out of the way in the countryside. When we got there we thought it was closed, but in fact, we were the only patrons there at the",
          "This is the place to be for Arnold Schwarzenegger fans! The museum is Arnold's old home, some rooms are full of memorabilia (movies, bodybuilding, personal life) while others are decorated the way they were when Arnold lived there. In summertime there are guided tours on",
          "We came here more so for the hubby, an Arnie fan, lots of memorabilia to see, though the DVDs that are on for sale the movies he has starred in are a bit over priced 20\u20ac per DVD! tours are on offer on the weekends it would be more interesting if we were able to attend but",
          "I visited the museum with my friend, so as big fans, it's obvious I vote it excellent :) If you like Arnold's movies, work as a governor and his achievements in bodybuilding, it's highly recommended to visit! The museum is near the Thalersee, which is awesome as well. It's easy",
          "I'm a big fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger and therefore, this museum was like heaven for me. It is practically a big mansion with each room having a different theme. It tackles the different aspects of Arnie's life. It depicts Arnie's bodybuilding, acting, political and personal",
          "Laterns is a little town 626km from Arnold Schwarzenegger Museum (Google Maps). The address is Linakstra\u00dfe 9, 8051 Thal bei Graz. From Graz you'll reach the Museum with public transport with Bus 40 to G\u00f6sting and than Bus 48 to Thalersee. On the Website of the Museum, you get",

          "We stayed in Graz and it was easy to get the bus from Graz train station to Thal. You need to take 2 buses but it only takes 20 mins.The museum is just up the road from the bus top. First right theres a sign. The museum itself is 5 rooms with items from different times in his"

          "I do not know which is better, the Schloss, or the park/gardens surrounding it. The Schloss defies normal description, with its mathematical precision of towers, windows etc. conforming to the calendar. The park is a paradise with the added delight of the multitude of peacocks",

          "We've only seen the park, not the palace and we liked it, but I must say that I expected a bit more. It's a nice walk, but not much more than that. We visited with a family and the playground is so so, the flower arrangements are nothing special, even the peacocks are a bit sad",
          "We took the guided tour. The variety and the insight into the history of this castle was fantastic. It took around 90 Minutes and we could have stayed a day. So much to see, from decoration to paintings to furniture. The tour around the first floor, the ground floor is still",

          "My partner i loved the outdoor park which costs 2 euro per adult to enter. Though manicured as part of the estate, it's great for picnics, strolling around and just listening the wind blow through. A one hour guided tour that costs 9.50 euro per adult, gives a good overall",

          "This palace on the edge of town is worth making the effort to visit, which must be seen with a guided tour. Our guide was outstanding in her presentation, giving a lot of background about the various rooms we visited. There are a few tours in English, but it is hard to come by",
          "The castle itself is well preserved and interesting (we had a great English speaking guide). The park surrounding it is lovely. However the best part for me were the many peacocks. The peacocks run in and out of the castle, posing on benches, walls and window ledges and",

          "This beautiful schloss and gardens is worth visiting if only to see all the peacocks and hear their unusual calls. The gardens are beautiful as us the schloss itself and the trees are gnarly and unusual too",
          "This was a fascinating place. The Eggenberg family in the 17th century decided to portray on their ceilings the history of the world (including mythology), They chose to represent themselves as enlightened princes by creating a ponderous architectural calendar scheme where there",

          "Its a great place and fantastic location. Only minus is they have a not very tourist friendly tour shedule. English was only avaliable one tome in the morning and one time in the afternoon. Alone you can not go and see the rooms.",
          "We were here in November on Sunday so the castle's rooms were closed. But the castle is great, very well maintained and the park is huge and wonderful. Best period to go there is from April to October when the rooms are open to anyone (without booking a guided tour).",

          "Beautiful gardens, amazing painting pictures, huge rooms are only a few aspect of this very interesting place. The guide explain you the whole history of the Palace, therefore I fully recommend to go for the pay tour, don't stay only in the gardens or you gonna miss several",
          "The tour through the State Rooms are well worth the price. The Alte Gallery was also very good. The archaeology museum was a little weak, especially if you have visited other collections. If you collect coins, the collection there is a must-see. If time permits, a walk through",
          "Easily accessible by #1 tram from the main square (\u20ac4.8 for day pass, \u20ac2.10 for single trip, buy from machine in square). The guide spoke excellent English and gave a very informative and knowledgeable account of the 24 rooms in the tour in this majestic building. Senior",
          "This Schloss was a short tram ride from our hotel. The gardens were lovely and we were amused by the many peacocks. We waited a while for our English speaking guide. She was well informed and very personable. However the rooms are dark and empty of furniture. We could get no",

          "We didn't get to take the castle tour but walked the grounds and inside the courtyard of the castle. Lovely area and very peaceful in the afternoon. We had some ice cream at the restaurant outside the gate to end the evening as the park closed. Only complaint is that the",
          "Eggenberg palace is not a big palace, HOWEVER it wins my heart! Usually we would expect to see a lot of barriers in a palace, but here in Eggenberg, only guided tour will enables you to visit the chambers, and therefore you will be walking around the rooms without any barrier!",
          "Amazing architectural treasure. We took the guided tour of the second floor staterooms. Incredible to see all the original flooring, furniture and paintings. The castle also contains a wonderful art and coin collection. The tour is in English and you can take as many photos",

          "We recently visited Schloss Eggenberg on a rainy and overcast day in Graz. Despite the poor weather, this is a must see attraction when touring Graz. We took tram number 1 in the direction of Eggenberg and the stop is close to the castle. All exhibits close for the winter",
          "Eggenberg is a wonderful place where you can spend some free time, if you want to relax and calm down.There is a beautiful park, which is worth walk in every season. I haven't visited the schloss itself, because it was closed, but I was glad to see it at least from the outside.",
          "The grounds are kept quite perfect . The park is gorgeous and weddings are held here. The residence is wonderful to tour and some tours are held in English. The street train takes one right near the entance.",
          "My husband and I took our three boys (14, 12, and 8 years old) here by tram from the center of Graz. The trams are very easy to use, although you should be aware, you need to press the button by the door for the doors to open - we didn't realize this at first and the tram left",
          "The Castle is a really charming place with a very interesting history. And the park around it is worthwile to see as well. Don't miss the Museum of Archaeology in the back of the park. And if you have the chance to attend a candle light tour through Schloss Eggenberg (or maybe a",
          "Loved the gardens and the cafe in the grounds was lovely. The castle tour was quite impressive and the stories behind it's construction and role in the Austrian monarchy were really interesting to learn about. My favourite? The peacocks wandering through the beautiful grounds.",
          "Splendid house and estate easily reachable by tram - 15 mins from Central Graz. The tour of the main rooms is highly recommended while the collections are surprisingly good.",
          "Beautiful grounds with peacocks freely roaming. The artwork in this castle is beautiful. Definitely worth a look.",
          "Our mistake was that we went to see it on a cold day + it was Sunday and we didn't went inside because it was closed. But only feeling that you're in a castle's surrounding gardens with peacocks is keeping you satisfied long after you leave Graz...",
          "A very nice timespending option even without visiting the Schloss (which is definitely worth visiting). The park is so beautiful! Plenty of space to wander, lots of cosy corners to explore. The Planet garden is lovely. Lots of peacocs. English tour to the castle is free and run",
          "The castle is surrounded with a very large park. The park is very serene, and we could see a few pretty peacocks roaming in that area. We nearly missed a small pond on the right side of the castle. There is also a museum behind the castle, but it was closed when we visited,",
          "I first visited the Schloss and the park in my childhood and have loved returning there ever since! The castle has nice exhibitions, concerts and ist a stunning building, and offers a great shop; but I even like the garden more, which is a nice experience in every season, offers",
          "Austrian castles and gardens are beautiful and a visual treat for everyone and this is one of them. It has got everything- historical background, a rose garden, playing area for little kids, peaceful atmosphere and attractive peacocks. You can visit this place in any season.",
          "Nice castle. The park around are amazing. There are separate entrance fees for the park and for the inside of the castle (you buy the latter at the castle entrance). Be sure to get there earlier so you don't miss the the room guided tour, like we do. But I suppose it is well",
          "The Schloss and surrounding gardens are very beautiful. Unfortunately the inside was already closed when I got there. There's free parking for the visitors.",
          "The Room Tour is interesting and well promoted but it was the gallery that was amazing. The stained glass and works from 1100 to 1550 were wonderful and you can get really close. Very underrated!",
          "It is certainly worth to make a tour to Schloss Eggenberg, cheap entrance fee, EUR 8, but you see a very beautiful castle, not Windsor but small and very well looked after, also the park which surrounds the castle is worth to visit.",
          "The palace is set in a huge and peaceful park with gardens and peacocks (which unfortunately have had most of their tail feathers pulled out). The palace is nice though not amazing and it was not clear upon entry that you had to pay an additional fee to enter the museums inside.",
          "Schloss Eggenberg is well worth a visit for several reasons. First, it houses the Alte Galerie with a terrific and well-designed exhibit of medieval and renaissance art, The explanations are in English and German and the thematic design of the exhibit is highly effective and",
          "Good time to visit in the warmer months, you can stroll though the grounds, watching the peacocks at their display. Join a tour to see the rooms on thefirst floor, and .... Well,way more to see there than I thought, as it is just a small castle in styria!",
          "We visited this palace in summer. The garden is much bigger than the palace itself. The roses garden is nice, and we just strolled around and enjoyed the green grass. Also, there is the archeological museum, pretty boring for me... Whoever been to Schonbrunn in Vienna - there is",
          "this is a must-see spot if it is your first time to Graz. Very easy to access by public transport. Don't miss the guided tour that are in German or in English. Disappointed that there is no English description in the coin museum. The entrance fee of the Park leading to the",
          "We under estimated the time needed to view this place! take the guided tour and see it all! Parks and gardens are beautiful and the strutting peacocks are resplendant!!",
          "Good place to walk, peacocks walking around making noise",
          "Located 15 minutes by tram from the train station, a beautiful palace. Tour guide included in the ticket price which was very interesting. Loved the coin and archaelogy museum too. Great value!!! Lunch in the vast park made it a good day trip.",
          "Just missed a tour so would have had to wait 2 hours, as there is no tour from 1.00-2.00. Gardens are stunning but 2 hours is a bit too long to fill in.",
          "This is a baroque palace, make no mistake. But it still looks and feels as though a family owns it and has used it. In good, cared-for condition but feels and looks as though the pictures ,furniture etc have not been planted for effect. Overall, a very positive experience.",
          "A must when You are in Graz. Castle with its garden is easy accessible from the centre of Graz. Take the tram no1 and it will lead You to the gate. Unfortunately only the group tour is allowed and it can be a bit boring. While waiting your tour there is a small cafe in the",
          "This is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it did not fail to live up to its status. The ceiling paintings alone were worth the visit. They were completed in the 1600s and are in phenomenally great shape considering their age. The palace is a work of art in and of itself, with",
          "Beautyful, peaceful place, and very friendly peacocks. I was thinking if I lived in Graz I would spend most of my freetime here.",
          "The guided tour, in English, of the state rooms for just 2 of us, was magnificent. Do not miss the art gellery - it's very fine and well organised.",
          "The State Rooms are well worth a visit, the British equivalent is a stately home. Impressive painted ceilings and walls, interesting Art collection",
          "Set in beautiful and well maintained gardens. It is a castle built in the baroque style built around an internal courtyard. The entrance fee is modest and you can visit the interior and see the rooms and the church. In 2002 the Austrian Mint produced a commemorative gold coin",
          "This castle had already been in existence for a century or more before the Hapsbergs more famous castle in Vienna ( Schonbrun ) was even getting updated from a hunting lodge ..... Kids went nuts over the peacocks strutting about the property . Easy access in and out . We liked",
          "If you are looking for some peace and nature do not miss this park",
          "The Schloss Eggenberg is located to the west of the town center. Although it pales compared to other castles it is worth a visit when you are in Graz. They have a small but excellent art museum with mostly religious works from the 14th through 18th century. A few major pieces"

        "wiki": "Graz ( GRAHTS, German: [\u0261\u0281a\u02d0ts] (listen); Slovene: Gradec) is the capital city of Styria and Austria's second-largest city after Vienna. As of 1 January 2019, Graz had a population of 328,276 (292,269 of whom had principal-residence status). In 2015, the population of the Graz larger urban zone (LUZ) stood at 633,168, based on principal-residence status. Graz has a long tradition as a seat of higher education. It has four colleges and four universities with more than 60,000 students. Its historic centre  (Altstadt) is one of the best-preserved city centres in Central Europe.For centuries, Graz was more important to Slovenes and Croats, both politically and culturally, than the capitals of Ljubljana, Slovenia and Zagreb, Croatia; it remains influential to this day. In 1999, the city's historic centre was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites and in 2010 the designation was expanded to include Eggenberg Palace (German: Schloss Eggenberg) on the western edge of the city. Graz was designated the Cultural Capital of Europe in 2003 and became a City of Culinary Delights in 2008.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name of the city, Graz, formerly spelled Gratz, most likely stems from the Slavic gradec, which means \"small castle\". Some archaeological finds point to the erection of a small castle by Alpine Slavic people, which over time became a heavily defended fortification. In literary Slovene and Croatian, gradec still means \"small castle\", forming a hypocoristic derivative of Proto-West-South Slavic *grad\u044cc\u044a, whichs descends via liquid metathesis from Common Slavic *gard\u044cc\u044a and via the Slavic third palatalisation from Proto-Slavic *gardiku, originally denoting \"small town, settlement\". The name thus follows the common South Slavic pattern for naming settlements as grad. The German name 'Graz' first appears in records in 1128.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGraz is situated on both sides of the Mur river in southeast Austria. It is about 200 km (120 mi) southwest of Vienna (Wien). The nearest larger urban centre is Maribor (Marburg) in Slovenia, which is about 50 km (31 mi) to the south. Graz is the state capital and largest city in Styria, a green and heavily forested region on the eastern edge of the Alps.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring municipalities ===\nThese towns and villages border Graz:\n\nto the north: Gratkorn, Stattegg, Weinitzen\nto the east: Kainbach bei Graz, Hart bei Graz, Raaba\nto the south: G\u00f6ssendorf, Feldkirchen bei Graz, Seiersberg\nto the west: Attendorf, Thal, Judendorf-Stra\u00dfengel\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nGraz is divided into 17 municipal districts (Stadtbezirke):\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement on the ground of the modern city of Graz dates back to the Copper Age. However, no historical continuity exists of a settlement before the Middle Ages.\nDuring the 12th century, dukes under Babenberg rule made the town into an important commercial center. Later, Graz came under the rule of the Habsburgs and, in 1281, gained special privileges from King Rudolph I.\nIn the 14th century, Graz became the city of residence of the Inner Austrian line of the Habsburgs. The royalty lived in the Schlossberg castle and from there ruled Styria, Carinthia, most of today's Slovenia, and parts of Italy (Carniola, Gorizia and Gradisca, Trieste).\nIn the 16th century, the city's design and planning were primarily controlled by Italian Renaissance architects and artists. One of the most famous buildings representative of this style is the Landhaus, designed by Domenico dell'Allio, and used by the local rulers as a governmental headquarters.\n\nThe University of Graz was founded by Archduke Karl II in 1585, it's the city's oldest university. For most of its existence, it was controlled by the Catholic church, and was closed in 1782 by Joseph II in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a lyceum where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-established as a university by Emperor Franz I, and was named 'Karl-Franzens Universit\u00e4t' or 'Charles-Francis University' in English. More than 30,000 students are currently enrolled at this university.\nThe astronomer Johannes Kepler lived in Graz for a short period. He worked as a math teacher and was a professor of mathematics at the University of Graz, but still found time to study astronomy. He left Graz for Prague when Lutherans were banned from the city.\nLudwig Boltzmann was Professor for Mathematical Physics from 1869 to 1890. During that time, Nikola Tesla studied electrical engineering at the Polytechnic in 1875. Nobel Laureate Otto Loewi taught at the University of Graz from 1909 until 1938. Ivo Andric, the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature Laureate obtained his doctorate at the University of Graz. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger was briefly chancellor of the University of Graz in 1936.\nGraz is centrally located within today's Bundesland (state) of Styria, or Steiermark in German. Mark is an old German word indicating a large area of land used as a defensive border, in which the peasantry is taught how to organize and fight in the case of an invasion. With a strategic location at the head of the open and fertile Mur valley, Graz was historically a target of invaders, such as the Hungarians under Matthias Corvinus in 1481, and the Ottoman Turks in 1529 and 1532. Apart from the Riegersburg Castle, the Schlossberg was the only fortification in the region that never fell to the Ottoman Turks. Graz is home to the region's provincial armory, which is the world's largest historical collection of late medieval and Renaissance weaponry. It has been preserved since 1551, and displays over 30,000 items.\nFrom the earlier part of the 15th century, Graz was the residence of the younger branch of the Habsburgs, which succeeded to the imperial throne in 1619 in the person of Emperor Ferdinand II, who moved the capital to Vienna. New fortifications were built on the Schlossberg at the end of the 16th century. Napoleon's army occupied Graz in 1797. In 1809, the city withstood another assault by the French army. During this attack, the commanding officer in the fortress was ordered to defend it with about 900 men against Napoleon's army of about 3,000. He successfully defended the Schlossberg against eight attacks, but they were forced to give up after the Grande Arm\u00e9e occupied Vienna and the Emperor ordered to surrender. Following the defeat of Austria by Napoleonic forces at the Battle of Wagram in 1809, the fortifications were demolished using explosives, as stipulated in the Peace of Sch\u00f6nbrunn of the same year. The belltower (Glockenturm) and the civic clock tower (Uhrturm), which is a leading tourist attraction and serves as a symbol for Graz, were spared after the citizens of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation.Archduke Karl II of Inner Austria had 20,000 Protestant books burned in the square of what is now a mental hospital, and succeeded in returning Styria to the authority of the Holy See. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was born in Graz in what is now the Stadtmuseum (city museum).\n\n\n== Population development ==\nThe more recent population figures do not give the whole picture as only people with principal-residence status are counted and people with secondary residence status are not. Most of the people with secondary residence status in Graz are students. At the end of 2016 there were 33,473 people with secondary residence status in Graz.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nOceanic climate is the type found in the city, but due to the 0 \u00b0C isotherm, the same occurs in a humid continental climate with based in K\u00f6ppen system (Cfb/Dfb borderline). Wladimir K\u00f6ppen himself was in town and conducted studies to see how the climate of the past influenced the Continental Drift theory. Due to its position southeast of the Alps, Graz is shielded from the prevailing westerly winds that bring weather fronts in from the North Atlantic to northwestern and central Europe. The weather in Graz is thus influenced by the Mediterranean, and it has more hours of sunshine per year than Vienna or Salzburg and also less wind or rain. Graz lies in a basin that is only open to the south, causing the climate to be warmer than would be expected at that latitude. Plants are found in Graz that normally grow much further south.\n\naverage temperatures: Graz Airport 8.7 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) / Karl-Franzens University 9.4 \u00b0C (49 \u00b0F)\naverage rainfall: 818 mm (32 in) with on average 92 days of rain (Karl Franzens University)\naverage hours of sunshine: 1,989 (Karl Franzens University)\n\n\n== Slovenes and Graz ==\nPolitically, culturally, scientifically and religiously, Graz was an important centre for all Slovenes, especially from the establishment of the University of Graz in 1586 until the establishment of University of Ljubljana in 1919. In 1574, the first Slovene Catholic book was published in Graz, and in 1592, Hieronymus Megiser published in Graz the book Dictionarium quatuor linguarum, the first multilingual dictionary of Slovene.The Styrian Slovenes did not consider Graz a German-speaking city, but their own, a place to study while living at their relatives' homes and to fulfill one's career ambitions. The student associations in Graz were a crucible of the Slovene identity, and the Slovene students in Graz were more nationally aware than some others. This led to fierce anti-Slovene efforts of German-speaking nationalists in Graz before and during World War II.Many Slovenian Styrians study there. Slovenes are among the professors at the Institute for Jazz in Graz. Numerous Slovenes have found employment there, while being formerly unemployed in Slovenia. For the Slovene culture, Graz remains permanently important due to its university and the Universalmuseum Joanneum archives containing numerous documents from the Slovenian Styria.A symposium on the relation of Graz and the Slovenes was held in Graz in 2010, at the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the first and oldest chair of Slovene. It was established at the Lyzeum of Graz in July 1811 on the initiative of Janez Nepomuk Primic. A collection of lectures on the topic was published. The Slovenian Post commemorated the anniversary with a stamp.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nFor the year that Graz was Cultural Capital of Europe, new structures were erected. The Graz Museum of Contemporary Art (German: Kunsthaus) was designed by Peter Cook and Colin Fournier and is situated next to the Mur river. The Island in the Mur is a floating platform made of steel. It was designed by American architect Vito Acconci and contains a caf\u00e9, an open-air theatre and a playground.\n\n\n=== Historic city centre ===\n\nThe historic centre was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999 due to the harmonious co-existence of typical buildings from different epochs and in different architectural styles. Situated in a cultural borderland between Central Europe, Italy and the Balkan States, Graz absorbed various influences from the neighbouring regions and thus received its exceptional townscape. Today the historic centre consists of over 1,000 buildings, their age ranging from Gothic to contemporary.\nThe most important sights in the historic centre are:\n\nTown Hall (Rathaus).\nThe Castle hill (German: Schlossberg), a hill dominating the historic centre (475 m (1,558.40 ft) high), site of a demolished fortress, with views over Graz.\nThe Clock Tower (Uhrturm) is a symbol of Graz, at the top of the Castle hill.\nThe New Gallery (Neue Galerie), a museum of art.\nThe Castle hill funicular (Schlossbergbahn), a funicular railway on the Castle hill's slope.\nThe seat of Styria's provincial parliament (Landhaus), a palace in Lombardic style. It is one of the most important examples of Renaissance architecture in Austria and was built by Italian architect Domenico dell'Allio between 1557 and 1565.\nThe Armoury (Landeszeughaus) is the largest of its kind in the world.\nThe Graz Opera House (Opernhaus), the principal venue for opera, ballet, and operetta performances. It is the 2nd largest opera house in Austria.\nThe Graz Theatre (Schauspielhaus), Graz's principal theatre for productions of plays.\nThe Cathedral (Dom), a rare monument of Gothic architecture. Once, there were many frescos on the outer walls; today, only a few remain, like the Landplagenbild (\"picture of plagues\") painted in 1485, presumably by Thomas von Villach. The three plagues it depicts are locusts, pestilence and the invasion of the Turks, all of them striking the town in 1480. It features the oldest painted view of Graz.\nThe mausoleum of Emperor Ferdinand II next to the cathedral, the most important building of Mannerism in Graz. It includes both the grave where Ferdinand II and his wife are buried, and a church dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria.\nThe Castle (Burg), with Gothic double staircase, built between 1438 and 1453 by Emperor Frederick III, because the old castle on the Schlossberg hill was too small and uncomfortable. The castle remained the residence of the Inner Austrian Court until 1619. Today, it serves as residence for the Styrian government.\nThe Painted House (Gemaltes Haus) in Herrengasse 3. It is completely covered with frescos (painted in 1742 by Johann Mayer).\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art Graz (Kunsthaus)\nThe Island in the Mur (Murinsel), an artificial island in the Mur river.\nBuildings, inner courtyards (e. g. Early Renaissance courtyard of the Former House of Teutonic Knights in Sporgasse 22) and roofscape of the old town.\n\n\n=== Outside the historic city centre ===\n\nEggenberg Palace (Schloss Eggenberg) a baroque palace on the western edge of Graz with State rooms and museum. In 2010 it was added to the existing World Heritage site of the historic centre of Graz.\nThe Mariatrost Basilica (Basilika Mariatrost) a late Baroque church, on the eastern edge of Graz.\nThe Jesus's Heart Church (Herz-Jesu-Kirche) is the largest church in Graz with the third highest spire in Austria, built in Gothic Revival style.\nThe Calvary Hill (Kalvarienberg) in the G\u00f6sting area of Graz with a 17th-century calvary and church.\nThe Graz University Hospital is the largest hospital in Graz and one of the largest hospitals in Austria. It's the largest Jugendstil building complex in Austria and was built between 1904 and 1912. It's run by the province Styria and is one of the most renowned hospitals in Austria and Central Europe.\nBest viewpoints for vistas of the city are the G\u00f6sting Ruin (Ruine G\u00f6sting), a ruin of a hilltop castle on the city's northwestern edge, and Plabutsch/F\u00fcrstenstand, behind Eggenberg Palace, with a hilltop restaurant and viewing tower.\n\n\n=== Greater Graz area ===\n\u00d6sterreichisches Freilichtmuseum St\u00fcbing, an open-air museum containing old farmhouses/farm buildings from all over Austria reassembled in historic setting.\nLurgrotte, the most extensive cave system in Austria.\nLipizzanergest\u00fct Piber, Lipizzaner stud at Piber where the famous horses are bred.\nThe Steirische Weinstra\u00dfe is a wine-growing region south of Graz, also known as the \"Styrian Tuscany\".\nThermenregion, spa region east of Graz.\nRiegersburg Castle, a mighty fortress that was never taken. It was a bastion against Turkish invasions\n\n\n== Culture ==\nDuring 2003 Graz held the title of \"European Capital of Culture\" and was one of the UNESCO \"Cities of Design\" in 2011.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe most important museums in Graz are:\n\nSchloss Eggenberg with Alte Galerie (paintings and sculptures from the Romanesque to the end of the Baroque period), Coin Collection, Lapidarium (Roman stonework collection),Archeological Museum (featuring the Cult Wagon of Strettweg) a special exhibitions area and the 90,000 m2 romantic landscape gardens.\nMuseum im Palais: museum of Styrian cultural history from the Middle Ages to the present.\nNeue Galerie: visual arts from the 19th and 20th centuries.\nNatural History Museum: exhibition of botany, mineralogy and zoology.\nStadtmuseum Graz: city museum.\nKunsthaus: exhibition hall of contemporary art.\nForum Stadtpark: museum of contemporary art.\nCamera Austria: museum of contemporary photography.\nLandeszeughaus: medieval armory comprising 32,000 pieces of armour and weaponry, largest of its kind in the world.\nVolkskundemuseum: museum of folk culture and lore.\nDi\u00f6zesanmuseum: museum of the Roman Catholic Church.\nK\u00fcnstlerhaus: exhibition hall of contemporary visual arts.\nLiteraturhaus: museum of contemporary German literature.\nMuseum der Wahrnehmung: museum of the senses, samadhi bath.\nKindermuseum Frida&Fred: museum for children.\nTramway Museum: 40 historic trams, the oldest dating from 1873.\nKriminalmuseum: museum of criminology.\nLuftfahrtmuseum: (Graz airport) aviation museum.\nHanns Schell Collection: key and lock museum, largest of its kind in the world.\nAustrian Sculpture Park: seven hectares of contemporary sculpture.\nBotanical Garden of Graz: three architecturally interesting glass houses plus gardens.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nThe Old Town and the adjacent districts are characterized by the historic residential buildings and churches found there. In the outer districts buildings are predominantly of the architectural styles from the second half of the 20th century.\nIn 1965 the Grazer Schule (School of Graz) was founded. Several buildings around the universities are of this style, for example the green houses by Volker Giencke and the RESOWI center by G\u00fcnther Domenig.\nBefore Graz became the European Capital of Culture in 2003, several new projects were realized, such as the Stadthalle, the Kindermuseum (museum for children), the Helmut-List-Halle, the Kunsthaus and the Murinsel.\n\nTallest buildings\nBuildings in Graz which are at least 50m tall: \n\n\n=== Sports ===\nSK Sturm Graz is the main football club of the city, with three Austrian championships and five runner-up seasons. The Grazer AK also won an Austrian championship, but went into administration in 2007 and was excluded from the professional league system.\nIn ice hockey, the ATSE Graz was the Austrian Hockey League champion in 1975 and 1978. The EC Graz was runner-up in 1991\u201392, 1992\u201393 and 1993\u201394.

It's still facing referendum, meaning usually the end for many former olympic bids in Europe and North America since 1970 -century.\n\n\n=== Styriarte ===\nGraz hosts the annual festival of classical music Styriarte, founded in 1985 to tie conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt closer to his hometown. Events have been held at different venues in Graz and in the surrounding region.\n\n\n=== Dialect ===\nReferred to as Steirisch by locals, Graz belongs to the Austro-Bavarian region of dialects, more specifically a mix of Central Bavarian in the western part of Styria and Southern Bavarian in the eastern part. The Grazer ORF, the Graz subsidiary of Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, launched an initiative in 2008 called Scho wieda Steirisch g'redt in order to highlight the numerous dialects of Graz and Styria in general and to cultivate the pride many Styrians hold for their local culture. Two reasons for a melding of these dialects with Standard German: the influence of television and radio bringing Standard German into the home and the industrialization causing the disappearance of the single farmer since the farming communities are seen as the true keepers of dialect speaking.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nAn extensive public transport network makes Graz an easy city to navigate without a car. The city has a comprehensive bus network, complementing the Graz tram network consisting of eight lines. Four lines pass through the underground tram stop at the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof) and on to the city centre before branching out. Furthermore, there are seven night-time bus routes, although these run only at weekends and on evenings preceding public holidays.\nThe Schlossbergbahn, a funicular railway, and the Schlossberg lift, a vertical lift, link the city centre to the Schlossberg.\nFrom the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), regional trains link to most of Styria. Direct trains run to most major cities nearby including Vienna, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Maribor and Ljubljana in Slovenia, Zagreb in Croatia, Budapest in Hungary, Prague and Brno in the Czech Republic, Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland, as well as Munich, Stuttgart, Heidelberg, and Frankfurt in Germany. Trains for Vienna leave every hour. In recent years many railway stations within the city limits and in the suburbs have been rebuilt or modernised and are now part of the \"S-Bahn Graz\", a commuter train service connecting the city with its suburban area and towns nearby.\nGraz airport is located about 10 km (6 mi) south of the city centre and is accessible by bus, railway, and car. Direct destinations include Amsterdam, Berlin, D\u00fcsseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart, Istanbul, Vienna and Zurich.\n\n\n== Health ==\nIn Graz there are seven hospitals, several private hospitals and sanatoriums, as well as 44 pharmacies.\nThe University Hospital Graz (LKH-Universit\u00e4ts-Klinikum Graz) is located in eastern Graz and has 1,556 beds and 7,190 employees. The Regional Hospital Graz II (LKH Graz II) has two sites in Graz.

Furthermore, several non-emergency ambulances (KTW \u2013 Krankentransportwagen) and a Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) are operated by the Red Cross to transport non-emergency patients to and between hospitals. In addition to the Red Cross, the Labourers'-Samaritan-Alliance (Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund \u00d6sterreichs), the Austrian organisation of the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps (Malteser Hospitaldienst Austria) and the Green Cross (Gr\u00fcnes Kreuz) operate ambulances (KTW) for non-emergency patient transport. In addition to the cars, there's also the C12 air ambulance helicopter stationed at Graz airport, staffed with an emergency physician in addition to regular personnel.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nGraz is twinned with:\n\nOther forms of cooperation and city friendship similar to the twin city programmes\n Ni\u0161, Serbia\n Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nThe following are past and present notable residents of Graz.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Austria portal\nList of World Heritage Sites in Austria\nKastner & \u00d6hler\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"Graz: Stadtplanung und Stadtentwicklung (Rechnungshofbericht, 2006) in German\" (PDF). 2006.

          "We queued for quite a long time to see a very small vile of blood. I'm sure it's better when they have the festival or whatever it's called and the building itself is lovely but not sure I'd bother going",
          "Very old church and museum which, according to the local lore, houses a specimen of Christ's blood from the Cruxificion.",
          "Tradition tells us that this church contains a piece of fabric on which Joseph of Arimathea wiped the blood of Jesus Christ. Whether or not you believe this, it is a special and beautiful church - definitely worth a stop if you are in the area.",
          "We happened upon this church as we were strolling through town. It was closed so we couldn't go in, but even from outside it was lovely.",
          "I had visited the Basilica as a child with my parents and as I hadn't been back to Bruges since, in memory of my parents, we visited here on a Friday afternoon. The queue to see the Vial of our Lord's blood wasn't too long but it was definitely an experience worth doing. Once",
          "When we arrived there was a crowd coming out but they were an organised tour. For us, the church was quiet and the believers took the steps up to pay homage to the phial in front of a colourfully dressed cleric. It\u2019s worth visiting just to see the gaudy medieval style decoration",
          "First of all this is a tourist attraction, nothing more, but an excellent one ... In February 2020, there were some interior repairs and half of the cathedral became partially accessible but you can enter and this is the best thing to do. If you want to see a museum room go",
          "This is two churches in one building. The lower church that is Romanesque and the upper church is neo-Gothic. The upper church has the relic of the Holy Blood.The blood, from the body of Christ, was somehow preserved by Joseph of Arimathea and eventually the vial was given to",

          "Basilica is a buliding in the corner which is overshadowed by the museum. The vial is displayed around 11am. We couldnt stay that long due to our travel plans and missed it. But the Basilica itself is a nice place to visit.",

          "I really enjoyed this church and payed an extra 2.50 euros to go into the small museum. Downstairs is a really interesting Chapel which is worth a quick look, but we couldn't get a lift to go upstairs, so I went alone. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed it and found its history",

          "If you are attending the veneration, get there just before it starts to get a seat for the ceremonial part and avoid queueing, as you can not interrupt the veneration. You can be queueing out of the door if you are late and it is busy. Each person gets a few seconds to view the",
          "What a wonderful experience when the frescibis painted by Michelangelo and the archbishop was on the visit, holding the Holy Blood, which was brought during Crusades. If it is true, it's pretty amazing that it didn't clot even after I'm many centuries",
          "A trip to Bruges was a delight for me. Away from the busy and crowded Brussels, Bruges was a nice escape. It is a small touristic town with abundant places to buy chocolates and such a wide choice of waffles. You should not leave from Brugeswithout trying waffles. It is a small",

          "No charge to visit the Basilica. I managed to hear the veneration and see the icon. Touching little homage to the Crusades.",
          "The basilica itself is rather small and in a corner of the square. It is a very moving place, even for those who may not be very religious. Twice a day the veneration of the holy blood is celebrated. They do close for lunch.",

          "We were fortunate to arrive just as the Holy Relic of the Precious Blood was exposed for viewing. For us it was a veneration of an object that people have held to be sacred for hundreds of year. It allowed us a special time to pray for the health of a family member who was",
          "This gorgeous almost hidden church in Burg Square embodies the evangelical spirit of the Renaissance. Stop in the lower chapel before going up the stairs to the bright Gothic style upper chapel, where the venerated relic of the Holy Blood is held in the tabernacle..",
          "It was said as a \"must so it\". Well, I may admite it worths: this sacrwd location embodies well enough rhe evangelical spirit of Renaissance.",
          "We came here as a 'must do' thing while in Bruges. Let me just say, it certainly is a must see! It's a gorgeous church, even though its quite hidden. It's located behind the town hall, to the side almost in a corner. We climbed up some stairs into the church, though lift access",
          "We travelled from Brussels Grand Central Train Station to Brugge early Wednesday morning, it is cheap and fast (just 1 hr. 15 min aprox.). I recommend downloading the SNCB app to buy the tickets, keep track of the trains and platforms where they will depart/arrive. We arrived",
          "I't a must! Wonderful architecture, legendary Crist Blood relic. Not easy to find, you have to go through some kind of secret passage to the upper floor where the basilic is located. I reccomend morning hours - you can witness an adoration ceremony when the holy phial is carried",
          "We were lucky enough to go to Mass at the small church downstairs. There are two churches within the structure. We didn't realize they show the Relic within the church upstairs the first day. We went back several days later and it was a very moving experience. When I got up on",
          "A really beautiful church, we spent a quiet half hour just wandering around and taking in the beauty of the artwork and stained glass windows. A must see if visiting Bruges.",
          "Free to enter. Make sure you visit the upper and lower chapels. The lower is darker and focuses on the suffering of Jesus, the upper is a riot of colour and light",
          "From the outside the building is very beautiful and interesting. I can\u2019t deny that. It all went down hill from there however. We went inside 5 minutes before they bring the cloth out and took a seat. The priest brings the glass vessel in carried above his head like the FA",
          "The Basilica is really two churches. The lower/ ground floor church is dark and atmospheric. The upper church is accessed by a separate staircase outside. It\u2019s a pre- Raphelite dream with stunning painted surfaces. We were lucky enough to visit while the vial of Holy Blood was",
          "Small church but beautiful outside and in. Free to go in and look around and their us a cheap museum if you want to spend a little bit more. Well worth a visit.",
          "Knowing the culture and understanding the basics of how we review religion and respect it this place becomes a must to all who visit the old town of Bruges.",
          "We visited this place on the Saturday and got there 5 minutes before the procession of the phial of blood. It was quite dramatic and more so if this was your religion. Great experience but it is only processed at14.00 get there before it begins as it gets very busy",
          "A fragment of cloth with the blood of Jesus displayed in a 13th Century perfume bottle, and housed in a small Basilica. Thousands of visitors / worhippers every month ! Worth visiting but left wondering why no DNA profile has ever been obtained from it. The little Basilica is",
          "Though you can not photograph the relic, you can grab some shots within the basilica itself. Incredibly beautiful and solom experience. For the donation of a Euro, you can purchase a candle to light after viewing the relic. Be prepared for a line.",
          "Whilst in Bruges we did visit this Basilica and to see inside at the amazing architecture and decoration is worth it ,we also got to see the vessel that contains ( it is said ) the blood of Christ and this was completely free...\u2026.So why not go and see yourselves.",
          "What else can be said - The church houses a venerated relic of the Holy Blood allegedly collected by Joseph of Arimathea and brought from the Holy Land by Thierry of Alsace, Count of Flanders. Built between 1134 and 1157. Very special.",
          "This church is next to the Stadhuis, and doesn't seem like a church from the outside. It is dark and highly decorated, looking more like an ancient baronial Hall. On the inside it is stunning. There is a phial, said to contain the blood of Christ. This can be viewed, when",
          "We almost didn't do this but we were very happy we did. It is a relatively small church but the whole atmosphere is so special. If the relic is out, it is watched over by one of the brotherhood and you can walk up a set of stairs to view it. We were handed a small prayer card",
          "This spot is magical. Beautiful in its own right the Basilica is special in that it contains a relic sacred to christian faiths. Regardless of your religion it is a spot that allows you to get close to \"The Blood of Christ\" and sense the reference with which it is greeted by so",
          "Visited on 10 oct 2019 . No entrance fee , if you want you can donate or not . There is also a minor museum inside which i did not visit . There is great artwork in this Basilica and also a relic , the blood of Jesus Christ , you can pray at it and donate if you want .",
          "While researching on places to go in Belgium my friend referred Bruges and while doing my itinerary I came across this Basilica which houses the Blood of Christ as he was being cleaned by Joseph of Arimathea after his death. This was being guarded by a priest and one can touch",
          "From the outside - which is the only part I can make an opinion since it was closed and we couldn't wait for its opening - it's an interesting building located in the central part of Brugge.",
          "We visited the Basilica and found the story of the blood interesting. We also went to the Treasury, which was quite small and not much to see. The Church is free, there is a charge for the Treasury which we would not recommend.",
          "We were in time at 11.30 for the veneration of The Holy Blood. It was well organized, solemn and the young priest explained the proceedings in 3 languages. He did say it was not a tourist attraction but a veneration. I was delighted with this as I am a Catholic. No pictures are",
          "This is worth a visit! Beautiful interior, colorful, rich. Not too big, so it's a short visit. Be quiet inside.",
          "I did not expect the holy blood to be on display when I visited so to find that it was was truly miraculous! Beautiful church, interesting and very reasonably priced museum and a piece of history that will spiritually awaken even the darkest of souls.",
          "One of the must places to visit in Bruges. The highlight is an opportunity to have glimpse at the holy blood.",
          "Tucked in a corner of the Burg on an upper floor, this is one of the most beautiful churches we've ever seen. It's not brash and blingy, just exquisitely decorated. There are regular expositions of the relic that gives it its name.",
          "I really don\u2019t know why this place has such high reviews. Must be written by a lot of religious folks, which is fine. But for me, the visit was not worth it. My fianc\u00e9 and I stopped by on an August morning, not during one of the hours when they \u201cshow off\u201d the \u201cblood of Christ\u201d.",
          "You could easily miss the Basilica, it\u2019s well hidden. It is worth seeking out though, the decoration is so beautiful and ornate. A peaceful corner of a busy tourist city.",
          "We knew we wanted to go to this church while in Bruges but thought we were looking at an interesting building that was black and grey like a haunted house before we realized what we were entering. We happened to arrive just a few minutes before the short ceremony when they",
          "Going to the Veneration of the Holy Blood was an interesting experience. The staff handled tourists well when they tried to take photographs and cut the line. I do wish that the Holy Blood was in a separate room in order to keep the main chapel more open for visitors.",
          "If you really want to live a mystic experience in Brugge, make real silence, stop the time, connect with the supetnatural, no matter your beliefs, this is your place, it's definitely a must, you can't say you visited Brugge if you don't stop by this mystical basilica.",
          "It is a great feeling to walk through this holy place. I am glad it has been protected and kept in good condition. You can spend a lot of time here.",
          "Really stunning church but now view of the vial containing the relic. There are times of the day they do a ceremony but we didn\u2019t wait around. If you want a nice church view this will fit but if you want to see the relic that\u2019s a miss.",
          "Like all Big Old Church Buildings in Old Town European cities, nowadays, it is a tourist Congregation. Some very good architecture in a neat historic old town of a great. Take a photo, at least and duck through to the canal and the Hotel Duc de Bourgogne, chocolate stop beside",
          "Clearly, from walking in you realise that this is a significant and important religious location that is extremely popular because of the artefact that is held and on show within. The art, deco and wooden panelling is stunning and very grand, which typifies the power and wealth",
          "Gorgeous piece of history. We did not stay for the spectacle of the blood of Christ being carried out, but worth the visit anyways. Beautiful architecture.",
          "Go if you'd like to see the spectacle of the blood of Christ being carried out and back into it's chambers as a ceremonial duty. And pray, pray. It's beautiful",
          "We arrived on the Friday afternoon and went inside. Absolutely beautiful. We couldn't see the blood on that day as it was between 2pm and 4pm. We returned on the Saturday and were seated in the front row. The 5 minute service commenced and then we filed up row by row to touch",
          "A beautifully ornate chapel upstairs with a shoddy single roomed 'Museum' off the foyer. Whilst I will never begrudge giving a few Euros to upkeep an old building, it is clear that this church is less of a place of worship and more of a tourist trap designed to turn a profit for",
          "This is one of the nicest churches I've been too. It's very small, but the simple, old interiors with the dim lighting eill take you back in time. Could be hard to find because it is literally in a corner of a huge square.",
          "This is one of the reasons Bruges became such an important place, as pilgrims would visit the city to see the relic brought back from the crusades. Be sure to visit both the ornate upstairs and simple downstairs chapels.",
          "The holy blod is stored in a tube a priest always there to watch. The church itself is not the most beautiful and very small but it worth a quick visit.",
          "I'm not typically interested in relics but being in Bruge and as a lover of history, why not? The church is relatively small, tucked into the corner of a busy square, up a flight of dark stairs. We donated/tipped/paid/? a half euro when we saw the relic, apparently of Christ's",
          "The paintings and the structure of the inside are fabulous if you ever get to see them. I receive a text on my phone so I take out of my purse, next thing you know a man comes up to me saying I can\u2019t take pictures which I wasn\u2019t and kicks me out. But apparently if you make",
          "Our guide took us to the historic Burg square during our day trip to Bruges. Standing in one corner is the ancient Basilica of the Holy Blood and we were given about half an hour to visit. There is no entrance fee but you need to climb some stairs to get in. The hammer beam",
          "Do yourself a favour and spend some time in this beutiful Basilica. I've seen too many tourists skiping it, or just having a quick look there. It is worth your time. While you are there, do go to the small museum (only 2 euros) that has some rare art which will make your",
          "You queue for a short time to get to see a vial of blood which may be Christ\u2019s blood. You could have a reasonable amount of time to express your faith and belief. Whether you believe or not the chapel is beautiful and ornate. It is definitely worth a visit.",
          "There is a lower and upper chapel, both built by a crusader (like from the Crusades - as in military campaigns in Medieval Times, to the eastern shores of the Mediterranean aimed at recovering Holy Lands from Muslim rule). This is big time stuff!!!! Lower chapel is dungeon",
          "The basilica houses the sacred relic of the Precious Blood of Christ. You are allowed to place your hand on the glass casing that houses the relic. I observed some visitors look curious and understandably if you are not a Christian. As for me and my family, this was a very",
          "The building looks very cool on the outside, and it\u2019s absolutely stunning inside. I was blown away by the decor! Make sure you go into the other church as well that is hidden by this one. My guide said that one is from the original city in the year 6",
          "Went with my 2 teenage boys, we all were impressed. The Basilica of the Holy Blood (Basiliek van het Heilig Bloed) is a 12th century chapel, which houses a revered vial containing cloth stained with the actual blood of Christ.",
          "Quick trip into this old church to view the Holy relic , can only be seen at 2pm , a bit of a queue but not too bad",
          "Beautiful basilica to visit. Free if you do not visit the museum. on a Saturday morning, immediate access. Around 3 pm, the queue was outside",
          "A few days in Brugges where most people were warm and friendly. Went to Mass here most days during my stay. It was the only place where you feel unwelcome. Go to see and venerate the Holy Blood of Jesus. He\u2019ll make you welcome, even if the staff don\u2019t.",
          "It's interesting to see and experience the extremely old building and if you time it right you can see the Holy Blood. They do ask for a contribution if you're going up to see it but it isn't compulsory. Worth going in to have a look around, it's free and doesn't take long.",
          "We were so lucky to be able to see the holy relic. Well worth a visit! We waited about 15 minutes to be able to have a moment with the relic. We donated \u20ac2 each.",
          "The basilica is ornate and beautiful! The museum is interesting. The service was special and I was glad to have gone. I would recommend going whether you are Catholic or not. Quiet yourself and feel the presence of God.",
          "The Basilica of the Holy Blood is located in Burg Square, and we actually stumbled upon it without realising it. While not extremely religious, we felt visiting the holy blood to be a very spiritual experience. I would highly recommend it.",
          "this basilica holds a (purportedly) sacred relic, but you would have to search to find it. No signage. No attempt at educating visitors on this lovely medieval church. The part I enjoyed the most was the glassed in view of stone sepulchers/coffins below the floor.",
          "My wife and I took a day trip tour of Brugge during our visit to Brussels last summer. The Basilica of the Holy Blood is located in Burg Square. This is a small church whose interior has brightly colored frescoes. We did not see the holy blood which is generally displayed to",
          "The Basilica is easy to get to. You need to walk up steep steps to see the holy blood. The church has lovely stained glass windows.",
          "Europe is filled with beautiful basilicas. This is another one of those - more like a historical museum. It's worth a stop by if you appreciate amazing architecture and exquisite art. Sadly though, it's a tourist trap. It's interesting how you can actually hear the clinking of",
          "The holy blood is displayed to general public only before 4 PM. however we went little late and missed to have a glance of the same. please note the time and make sure you don't miss it.",
          "The Basilica proper is situated up about 2 flights of fairly steep stairs in the corner of the Burg. As you would expect from a Basilica with a serious holy relic, this church is beautifully decorated. The relic is beautifully housed in a silver reliquary in a side chapel.",
          "The architecture in this church is beautiful. When you think of when and how it was constructed it\u2019s amazing. On a separate topic, we did see the relic as described in the tourist guides, etc... \u201cThe Basilica of the Holy Blood is a Roman Catholic basilica in Bruges, Belgium.",
          "The day we were there the church opened at 2 PM. They have a side altar where the relic of the blood and tissue of Christ is displayed. It was collected by Joseph of Aramathea and taken to Constantinople. From there it got to Bruges. Photos are not permitted as it is not a",
          "I've visited many cathedrals and churches but this beauty built in the 12th century church really moved me. This truly provides an impact of the medieval world and the medieval worshippers as one wanders and observes the architecture of this amazing church. I found the stained",
          "A richly decorated, ornate church in the corner of the Burg, well worth a visit even if you are not intending the queue to see the relic of the Holy Blood. The style verges on the more orthodox (reds, greens and gold on the walls, almost fresco style decoration). Try to go first",
          "It matters not what time you visit the Church of the Holy Blood - it is beautiful, moving and spiritual. If you return for the ceremony where the vial of blood is venerated, you will likely experience feelings unlike you've ever had before. Please find time to visit this",
          "We actually were lucky to be present when they got the Holy Blood out. Not sure if this is the right name for the tube, sorry if it isn't. The church reminded me of Christian Orthodox churches and it was beautiful. It is quite hidden at the corner of the town hall on the right.",
          "This is a must if you want to experience tranquillity, awe and a wish that you could stay for hours. Incredibly beautiful, quite small so easy to take it all in",
          "This church is one of those places we didn't know about until we happened upon it. Beautiful and Fascinating",
          "I visited the Basilica of Holy blood during the festival of Holy blood in Brugges. Needless to say, the whole city was crowded but luckily we got a chance to visit the Basilica and offer a prayer and touch the relic during the extended opening hours due to the festival without",
          "A friend and me were visiting Bruges and decided to act all touristy. When we arrived at the Basilica, it turned out at least 100 people had the same idea at the exact same time and more were pouring in. There was a giant line to lit a candle with a dude that turned out to be",
          "It is interesting to see the contrast between the old medieval chapel downstairs and the lavish newer chapel upstairs (both are free). We were fortunate enough to see the actual Holy Blood relic on display. Very inspiring.",
          "I was overwhelmed from the moment I entered this very sacred place. I could not stop crying, and I cannot explain why. The peace within the church is extraordinarily moving. There is no cost to enter the church but you are expected to make a donation if you wish to see the holy",
          "I've visited many Romanesque churches but the basilica's lower church has probably affected me the most. Built in the 12th century, it has retained its starkness and simplicity. You get a sense of what worshippers felt when they walked into such a place where light entered",
          "A real sacred place - beautifully decorated - we lined up to be in the presence of the holy Blood - it makes you humble -",
          "Stunning church, really breathtaking. It\u2019s nice that they have a small museum too so you got to see some history from the church too.",
          "Stunning painted chapel tucked in the corner of the square. Allegedly they have a vial of Christ\u2019s blood, if you believe that you\u2019ll believe anything!! Still chapel is well worth a visit",
          "The church is beautiful and easy to miss based on its location in the corner of the square. Be sure to visit the lower and upper church.",
          "It is located at the corner of the square. You are allowed to have a moment of reflection while touching the relic.",
          "This is lovely peaceful place to go and pray. Not commercial in any way shape or form. Tranquil & relaxing.",
          "This small church is well worth visiting. Inside it is very ornate and exceptionally beautiful. A serene place to stop a while during a busy day of sightseeing.",
          "For those who believe literally, representatively, or barely at all, this basilica can be a profoundly moving experience spiritually speaking. I will always return when in Bruges.",
          "We visited here on a busy Saturday and you were given the opportunity to go and be blessed by the priest if you wanted to. It was lovely to have some moments to sit and take in the wonderful architecture and history the church has to offer. It's free to go in although you can go",
          "This chapel is one of about 1700 minor Basilica in the Catholic faith. It was the private chapel built by a returning knight of the crusades. This knight didn't find the Holy Grail but he did find a drop of Christ's blood. You don't need to believe that to appreciate the",

          "A visit to this basilica will reward visitors with a decor unlike the usual rococo style in other European churches. The Basilica of the Holy Blood is located in the De Burg square. Look for it beside the city hall building - squished into the corner. It does not look like a",
          "It's tucked away in the corner of one of the public squares. An interesting place, but worth a visit. We didn't visit the inner museum. Be sure to check opening times. The priest and announcements were in various languages. We were 'fortunate' enough to arrive as the Vial",
          "The basilica consists of a lower and upper chapel. The lower Saint Basil's chapel was built in Romanesque style. It's a sober but charming structure with thick walls. It functioned as the Count's Chapel. The spiral staircase with a vaulted ceiling leads to the Chapel where the",
          "We just happened to walk up prior to the church opening in the afternoon, and the display of the relic was also happening. We sat through the brief ceremony and saw the holy blood. Aside from this (FYI, no pictures allowed of the relic or of the general area it is in), the",
          "To be fair I'm not a believer or none believer but this place is worth a visit as the old and new are both stunning",
          "Beautiful chapel with some amazing pieces of history to view in the museum and chapel. So much history to be immersed in",
          "The best part of this is not where you think it is - it\u2019s upstairs but accessed next door by the entry to the museum. A very impressive chapel indeed.",
          "Me and my daughter visited here and were really emotional, it was very touching and beautiful. Lovely recorded choir singing in the background. Amazing stained glass windows A very special place, Well worth a visit.",
          "Visitors to this site who want to see the blood of christ need to be prepared for a long queue. It is very popular but the church is magnificent",
          "Wow. This is a must for anyone visiting Bruges. A two minute walk from Markt Square. It's free to go into the Church and view a vial of Jesus's Blood. You just give a donation for the up keep of the church. You can get a museum tour for \u20ac2.50 per person. The Church is absolutely",

          "Located right across from the Crowne Plaza hotel, I went at 10am and got to see the museum plus the relic. It wasn\u2019t that crowded at that time of the day but it goes starting from 11 onwards.",
          "Many visitors go straight up the stairs to the hall where mass is held at the relic of Christ's holy blood is displayed (during selected hours) for public viewing, but what I find is often not mentioned is the church at the ground floor of this historical building. Among other",
          "We went there for the pre-Mass service on Christmas Day 2018 while on a 4 day city break in Bruges. It was a bizarre but enjoyable experience singing carols in Flemish. We are not Roman Catholics so did not stay for Mass but we did get to see the eponymous relic up close before",
          "Very special place. Beautiful Gothic basilica where you can quietly sit and meditate despite crowd around.",
          "This historically significant church is worth a visit. It is very small compared to the medieval skyscrapers that you see in beautiful Brugge. Lovely stained glass windows that have been reincarnated a couple of times illuminate the very peaceful feel interior. Drops of Christs",
          "This Church is free to enter and beautifully decorated The Blood of Jesus Christ was on display and definitely worth seeing if you are in Bruges",

          "We were fortunate to attend Easter Mass at this beautiful Basilica! Luckily got there about 25 minutes early to get a seat. Gazing at the magnificent artwork was a wonderful way to celebrate Easter morning.",
          "Beautiful church with parts dating from the 1100\u2019s. The exterior architecture is magnificent and the interior is breathtaking. We were fortunate enough to be able to see the relic of the Holy Blood. This is an awe inspiring place and experience,",
          "We didn't even get to see the (alleged) blood Jesus, and it didn't really matter, because the interior of the church alone (the lower chapel) was worth the visit. You get to experience a very old, Romanesque stone construction, a rare sight anywhere. It's almost like a window in",
          "This is up a flight of steps in the right-hand corner of the Burg. The basilica interior is stunning with highly decorative murals and carvings. Free entrance (unless you also want the museum). Not to be missed.",
          "You absolutely have to go in. So grand;So beautiful...weather you believe it or not... If you do believe they let you see the relics. I personally ALWAYS get a candle in temples of any religion...",
          "This church is easy to miss as it is tucked into the corner of one of the city's many squares. There are many steps to walk up to get to the church itself. I believe there is an elevator from the street level too. At certain times during the day, there is a very solemn ceremony",
          "Basilica of the Holy Blood is a working basilica with regular mass hours. When open to the public there is no admission fee just to see the church, there is a small fee for the museum. This church is beautiful. You may take photos inside, but not where Christ's Blood is on",
          "This church is almost hidden in the corner of the square. It consists of an upper and an older lower church. Both churches are interesting. The lower church is Romanesque. The upper church contains the famous relic of the Holy blood. On the Sunday afternoon we visited the relic",
          "As our visit was timed just before Easter, we entered the Basilica and luckily there was the exposition of the Relic of the Holy Blood where we were able to pray up close (and lay our hands on the glass case holding the relice. Unforgettable experience!!",

          "Almost hidden away in the corner of the square it would be easy to miss this magnificent but small church. It is accessed via a flight of stairs, or there is a lift available for those not able to ascend via the stairs. The church is certainly very beautiful with the decoration",
          "A renaissance church that was amazing with a very old church beneath it . The church is an important landmark as it houses a vial that supposedly contains the blood of Christ brought back from Jerusalem",
          "Even if you aren\u2019t religious it\u2019s worth going to see the inside of this basilica. It is beautiful, we sat in here for ages after going up to see the blood of Christ.",
          "Who knows. Just go and see for yourself. It's an amazing church in its own right. The added bonus is that this houses (apparently) the blood of Christ himself after 1200 years or it's been lost and then found in Turkey. I believe and question but I will leave this decision up to",
          "A very important church for the people of Flandre and religious center due to the preservation of the blood of Jesus. A lot of legends and stories are known about it. The inside is architecturally interesting and the stained glass pictures are magnificent!!!",

          "Irregardless of your faith, it is a must see. Once inside the chapel, a calmness is felt. Mass is offered at 11:00 daily and adoration of Christs precious blood is at 2:00. Always double check the times before going. For the adoration you proceed to a raised platform where a",
          "I can never get enough of the Cathedrals and Churches. This one did not disappoint. I found it to be beautiful and just a complete work of art and history. I could have sat here for the entire day.",
          "I'm not a religious person but we sat through a service in the morning and was moved by it. Beautiful building.",
          "The title pretty much says it all. There are many large, grand, ornate churches all over Europe you can visit to take in a feast for the eyes. Here you visit you see something truly unique, a small bit or what I think is cloth, with the blood of Jesus Christ on it. This is an",
          "Gorgeous basilica viverent colors with monk chanting in the background. Wonderful place to light candle and say a prayer. For a dontation you can get close to the blood of Christ and say a prayer.",
          "Very kind staff. Amazing relic , nice music. There is a short service before you see the relic of the holy blood .",
          "It\u2019s a small place, definitely not one of the large, grand, church\u2019s that the rest of the city has, but it has its own reverence, and certainly it\u2019s own significance. Take a look inside, you won\u2019t regret it.",
          "It does not look like a church. It's a large room after climbing a couple of floors. The sacred blood relic was on display guarded by a priest when I visited, so you could walk up and see it. There's also a museum in another room which charges a small entrance fee. I did not do",
          "Small but beautiful church. Too much focused in the black sausage they call a relic. If you are Catholic and very religious maybe it is a wonderful experience. I don't think so",
          "Not much to see really. The \"blood\" is locked away somewhere, with the large ornate gold box it's kept in locked behind a large secure glass box. There are a few old ornate pieces from history of the basilica in the room. \u20ac2:50 entrance fee to enter the room",
          "Really nice and interesting place to visit, plenty to see in this dated basilica. Worth finding and exploring.",
          "We visited this very small very religious, beautiful chapel and were very pleasantly surprised. It\u2019s gorgeous, the stained glass windows are stunning. You can view the vial containing a piece of cloth said to be stained with blood of Christ. The Chapel is free to enter, but",
          "This was a mind blowing building. The ground floor was like a Norman era Chapel which was very interesting. But upstairs the Chapel is something else. I had never seen such beauty and interesting things in such a small area. The Atmosphere was extraordinary to say the least.",
          "This is a pretty chapel and very inexpensive to visit. It is actually much bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside. I think we paid 2.5 euros each to see an exhibit / side room with a some religious artifacts. Honestly the blood vile seemed a little hokey to me:",
          "Well worth a visit. Went to the Mass this morning. Although we didn't understand it all (as in Dutch) the setting is well worth a visit. Very memorable.",
          "The basilica was beautiful and free to go into. We were able to see the ornate vial containing the blood of Christ and it was a moving experience. After prayer and meditation, we felt an incredible sense of peace. Don't miss this unique experience.",
          "Beautiful alter, looks small from outside but is actually quite big, free to go Into, or you can pay to in the museum , definitely worth a visit, quite a few stairs to go up.",
          "In every sense astonishing. From the highly decorative gilded interior, the precious relic, the keeper of the adoration altar, the silvered tabernacle. It all converged to allow one to privately meditate or pray for a few moments and in my experience left feeling a mere mortal.",
          "Im not religious in anyway but the beautiful interior of the church accompanied by the Gregorian chant back music, made for a relaxing and humbling experience. Very quick trip to the alter to have a look at the small relic (no photos allowed here) and then into the main part of",
          "An usual and interesting stop in Bruges. Seemingly unassuming from the outside, the inside is actually quite beautiful. Free to go into the sanctuary, and also to the left of the main entrance is another door that will allow you to access the crypt as well for free. A",
          "We happened to get here at 11:25 am and found out they would be bringing out the Holy Blood at 11:30 to noon for a service. We were able to walk right in and take part in the service. We did not pay for the museum so I can't speak to that, but an interesting place to visit.",
          "I am not religious but appreciate the beauty of churches. We wanted to look inside the church and of course respected those who were visiting to view the phial of blood that is said to be that of Christ\u2019s brought back from the Crusades. The church inside is beautiful and there",
          "Really worth the visit. And free. I wouldnt do the museam bit. Its not expensive. But really small. But the basilica is really very interesting.",
          "this is a wonderful tranquil place with not a sound to be heard just que for about 10 minutes to get to see a piece of cloth with what is said to be Christ,s blood on it",
          "Travelling through Europe, one inevitably comes across many impressive churches ; most of them in the Gothic or Neo-classic style. So, it was interesting to visit a church dating from the medieval ages. The basilica is small, wood-panelled and low ceilinged. The pillars are",
          "We were just in time for the veneration of the blood of Christ in a vial (check hours before going). You can get up close to it for a prayer. The Church is truly beautiful and very ornate and peaceful. You can also stop at the office at the entrance and pay to have a mass said",
          "The mass is very nice. There is a good singer and the priest speaks several different languages. At the end of the mass, you are able to venerate the holy blood.",

          "Our tour guide doesn't told us anything. That morning only said that would surprise us. And what way to do it. We were in front of a part of a Clothe with spots of Blood of Jesus. No talk, no pictures. A man with a dark suit with tie, was sitting behind the relic. Only looking",
          "It's a beautiful building, but on Fridays you can go and see the relic (I think it's between 10-11am, please check). So atmospheric and personal. Every year there is also a day when the relic is paraded around Bruges and that attracts 40,000 people, which must be a very",

          "Amazingly decorative frontage, located in the corner of The Burg square. There are lots of steps up to the church but there is lift access available. Inside is beautiful with stained glass windows and paintings along the walls. It\u2019s quite large inside. There is a museum as",
          "We were pleasantly surprised by the holiness of this Basilica. An amazing place of reflection and beauty which I do believe holds a vial of holy blood.",
          "What a wonderful basilica. The colours.. The wunderfull ceiling and... To much to write down. Just visit the basilica. And it will cost you nothing",
          "Because of time constraints we only spent an hour in this building but it would be easy to spend much longer discovering more.",
          "I can not begin to explain the feeling of calm to he had here. Such a beautiful place & so peaceful. With regards to the relic - I\u2019m not convinced, it felt commercialised. If you don\u2019t let yourself be distracted by this, it really is worth a visit. I felt so relaxed afterwards.",
          "I have visited the church just to hear about the mistery behind the holy blood story. Nothing exciting until the priest asked us to sit down and he started to talk about it. The silence has taken over entire building, everyone was eyes and ears. The story captured the entire",
          "Looked on the square, though a trifle difficult to find, a flight of stairs takes you up to a decorative fantasia. The actual reliquary is not on display, but the experience is quite worth the modest effort.",
          "The entrance through an ornate facade and up a flight of stairs is a pre-cursor to the rather unusual ceremony of the veneration of a phial of blood of Jesus Christ. A small elevated platform can be climbed to observe the phial in a glass case whilst a priest hands out a small",
          "The church is very beautiful. You must walk up some steps to get there but it is worth it. The inside is much different than you would expect from the outside. I would recommend going to the museum inside the church as well.",

They present this relic of holy blood",

          "What an amazing church. In a spot you wouldn't expect or really notice. The exterior is not of church convention but very ornate and beautiful in it's own right. Inside, the church is huge and certainly worth a visit and just some time to sit and think",
          "This church is rather small and nice and it claims that it holds the blood of Jesus. Inside is old, little and peaceful.",
          "A beautiful and very old little church, we were lucky enough to be there when they allowed people to see the relic of the Shroud. We spent a bit of time reflecting and remembering loved ones. The murals and stained glass windows were amazing.",
          "As a devout Catholic, seeing Jesus\u2019 blood was a lifetime experience! I had a tremendous feeling when i saw it and prayed from the bottom of my heart after this. A must-visit when in Bruges!",
          "A nice little reflective museum, the entry fee is a little steep considering how small it actually is, but the artefacts are stunning. You can light a candle for 50c which is a nice touch.",
          "The Basilica of the Holy Blood is a very old and historic church, dating as far back as the early 12th century. The importance of the church lies in the fact that it keeps safe what is supposed to be a venerated relic of the Holy Blood allegedly collected by Joseph of Arimathea",
          "The Basilica of the Holy Blood is a small but in the heart of Bruges. There are some stunning murals on the walls. There is no charge to get in.",
          "This church is definitely worth a visit and I agree with other reviews that being there felt very humbling. We lit candles for loved ones no longer here and sat a while to absorb the incredible architecture; the stained glass is beautiful!",
          "Small church in the heart of the Bruges. It is free entrance. The church is closed from the 1 p.m till 2 p.m. At 2 p.m. begins the ceremony of the Holy Blood in which everyone can take part and see the capsule with Holy Blood.",
          "Be sure to be there for 11:30-12:00 when the relic is open to view. It's quite a ceremony - and in five languages.",
          "We always visit this church. It's got a lovely atmosphere and the decoration is fantastic. I'm not religious but it clearly means a great deal to a lot of people. Definitely worth a visit and it's very central.",
          "This is a small gem located in the city centre. It's open every day of the year and it gives you some insight about Brugge in old times.",

          "It is worth seeing and is beautiful. I doubt the Holy Blood is the real deal, but it was an interesting experience. It does not look much like a church when you enter from the Market, but once upstairs it is very beautiful.",
          "I paid to enter the museum but the relic of the Holy Blood was not on display; however we did get to see beautiful paintings and the reliquary that houses the relic, which was jaw droppingly beautiful. After the museum at the Basilica, we decided to attend mass and I am so glad",
          "The Basilica was a memorable visit. We got to see the Holy Blood and made a small donation to the Basilica. It is a well kept iconic Basilica in Bruge and should not be missed.",
          "Beautiful small church, very dark with Gothic decorations. Went after 11 am on a Friday and there was a mass. There were plenty of seats for those wanting to watch the whole mass, but the masses of tourists jostling to view the church in the back made it unpleasant to stand. We",

          "the Basilica is well worth seeing, we went on Christmas Eve there is lots of history, very interesting, and people were being blessed",
          "This is a beautiful church and is not to be missed when in Bruges. It was especially lovely at Christmas time.",
          "Whilst the initial view of this Basilica in the corner of the old town hall square is not that impressive,inside it is a magnificent building certainly worthy of a visit.You enter from a wide,curving run of fairly narrow stairs and depending on your day choice you can enjoy it's",
          "Tucked in the corner of a square, accessed by a humble staircase, this incredibly beautiful church is all about the interior. The fact that on some days you will have to climb over power cables running the extensive open air market is just another contrast to the serenity and",
          "This is a unique spot to stop and see. The claim to have a piece of the cross and Jesus' blood. Whether or not it's the real deal is beside the point. The Basilica is unique and beautiful. Pop in for a quick visit!",
          "I've seen lots of churches in my travels and this one stands out for its unique style and beauty. I found interesting the wood-paneled ceiling, something I had not seen before. This is a good place to pause for rest and reflection as they have hymns playing and the tourists",
          "So the guide told us about this place which has housed Jesus blood. This church is at the corner and one needs to go up the staircase to see the chambers upstairs. It is nice, peaceful and beautiful.",
          "Lovely building inside and outside, would suggest you pay the 2.50 euro to see the museum inside, so lovely pieces of art.",
          "One of the most beautiful churches I have ever seen. Just a shame about the moronic people who insist on wearing a hat and chattering at volume ...zero respect...zero reading of the rules. That aside, lovely, whether you are a religious person or not.",
          "I had the honor of visiting the Basilica of the Holy Blood. I was extremely moved due to my deep faith and witnessing The Relic. The Basilica itself is gorgeous. The music was awe-inspiring. Please be respectful and maintain silence in the church.",
          "This sanctuary, from the bustle of modern life, takes visitors to a place of splendour and awe. The basilica is beautiful in its detailed art work and the housing of such a special relic makes it a must see for visitors to Brugge. Be aware that there are steps to climb, but",
          "This particular basilica houses a piece of the shroud that was said to have been used to wash Jesus Christ's dead body & it's meant to be adorned with his blood. Wound closed with twine and sealed with wax, you won't get that close to it unless you pay a tribute of your choice",
          "Much different than many other churches. Don't skip Saint basil's Chappell next to it. Check before visiting the opening hours.",
          "We were lucky to observe the Veneration of the Holy Relic in this beautiful Baroque Basilica. The service was short but poignant and I was able to participate. Very interesting but this event happens at a specific time daily.",
          "I had no idea what to expect when I climbed the stairs up to the church. The Gothic Revival style is exquisite as are the stained glass windows and the globe-shaped pulpit. It is definitely worth visiting.",
          "The Basilica is definitely worth visiting. The external architecture and internal decoration is very impressive.",
          "We came here early in the morning and at the displayed opening time and they didn\u2019t open the doors until an hour after opening time. Once inside, it is a small dark church. We were there when the took out the blood of Christ. They do a short ceremony and no photos are allowed",
          "We visited the chaple. Very small, very basic, very dark and atmospheric, in total contrast to the other churches in and around Brugges.",
          "A very ornate church, with a Priest on a raised area with the vial of the blood of Christ. To light a candle take a spill not turn one upside down to light it from another or you will be hissed at! I found no comfort or friendly feel in this Church, probably as it was so crowded",
          "Even if you aren\u2019t a religious person, this is a must. There is so much history here, all the staff were very knowledgeable. We had the chance to say a prayer with the vial of Christ\u2019s blood, then sit for a while in silence. The whole place is very serene and uplifting.",
          "A lot of people flock to this church in the centre of Bruges\u2019 old town in order to witness the vial said to contain Christ\u2019s blood - but even if you\u2019re not religious, it\u2019s worth a visit just for the architectural design, both inside and outside. It\u2019s a very cosy church which can",
          "It's a little church not too far from the center of town. There was a little line to see the vial of holy blood and you're expected to give a little donation.",
          "The church is a decent small chruch. The entrance is free besides a small donation to see christ's blood. Besides the main attraction, not much to see. Do visit to satisfy your curiosity, but the visit will likely be short.",
          "Nice little church, only real interesting part was the blood of Christ on the cloth which the old nun was showing. Didn\u2019t do museum, Brugge has a bad habit of charging for items that should be free. Is this a must see? A maybe",
          "Should be seen in Brugge... The Consecration is very charming which you can attend at 12:00 a.m. .....",
          "For a Basilica with a Holy Relic I was shocked at how understated the entrance was. Strange entrance up a stair well. It was definitely overshadowed by the city hall. I walked in and walked right up to the relic without waiting. I was so overwhelmed at how fast and easy it was",
          "This basilica is a hidden gem, make sure to go inside while in Bruges. It is located and a 2nd floor so go upstairs",
          "It's a somewhat like 'the da vinci code' when climbing the stairs towards the basilica. It's not that big, but when visiting between 14 and 16 hours, you can see the holy blood in it's relic. And even better: it's totally free. You can give a small token, if you like it.",
          "On our visit to the Basilica we viewed the phial of 'holy blood', we had not expected to see it and for a small donation we were allowed up to stand in front of it. It was a very moving experience in a beautiful church.",
          "This was a very moving experience viewing the blood of Christ. This is a must see for Christians, Catholics or lovers of history. This Basilica is in the middle of the old town, so there are also many other major attractions, canals, restaurants, chocolatiers, etc. Do not",
          "We love old churches. The design and ornateness of them are surreal sometimes. This is a good place to visit, just for the design. Of course there is the historical artifact that draws people also.",
          "Visited the Basilica and at first the feelings I experienced were not what I expected it to be. After all I was standing in a place so close to the precious blood of Jesus, my Lord and my Saviour. I then calmed myself down and went on my knees to pray and the calm and peace",
          "It was ornately decorated with colorful walls. Was just in time to see the relic brought out at 11:30 am. More awesome to pray with it. Priest reminded us that it was not a tourist attraction but it\u2019s a remembrance of Jesus Christ. Highlight of my trip in Bruges.",
          "Absolutely beautiful,well worth a visit,lovely peaceful place to sit and take a moment to reflect craftsmanship is just amazing",
          "The Basilica of the Holy Blood is a Roman Catholic basilica. It houses a vial that has a cloth inside with the blood of Jesus on it collected by Joseph of Arimathea that was collected after washing off the blood of Jesus after his death. It was brought to Bruges by Thierry of",
          "The outside of the Basilica is absolutely stunning and worth the visit. While climbing the stairs that lead to the entrance one can read the explanations of the Holy Blood and the history associated to the conservation of the Holy Blood. Once inside one can go up a few steps and",
          "The church is very beautiful and historical. It was a wonderful spiritual feeling to have seen the Relic with our own eyes. A totally different experience. Highly recommended, even for those who are not Christians.",
          "This is a beautiful Basilica that comprises two level churches. It is snugly located in a corner of Burg Square, the Basilica of the Holy Blood consists of a Romanesque lower chapel and a Gothic upper chapel The lower level church, a dark Romanesque structure, is so beautiful",
          "The church is very ornate outside but inside is much simpler. It is very peaceful and the stonework is amazing. Would love to visit during the procession.",
          "We arrived in Bruges on a friday to find the holy blood was on display between 2pm and 4pm, within the church itself on the 1st floor, no charge for the viewing, but a 2.50 charge to visit the treasury. Well worth a visit if you have a spare 30mins",
          "We were disappointed that we went to visit at 9:30 am which is when the notice said it opened but left at 9:40 as it was still not open.",
          "Well worth a look inside, very picturesque and a lot of history. Check out the pulpit, very good design.Free to enter and some very nice architecture and artwork.",
          "Pleased to discover that the Basilica was free to visit, donations for upkeep are invited and you only need to pay 50cents if you want to light a candle. Lots of history at this location and ideal photo opportunities but flash photography is not allowed. Very tranquil place to",
          "The church was very beautiful. It features some pretty stained glass. We were able to see the blood of Christ with no wait in line. Free admission was nice.",
          "It was interesting to see and to hear the history. I won\u2019t remember much because religious artifacts/cathedrals not that interesting.",
          "Well worth a visit, small museum attached priced at 2.50 Euro per person but the church itself is, of course, free to enter. Worth visiting between 2 and 4 pm to view the piece of cloth said to contain the blood of Christ. A very good place for quiet contemplation.",
          "Basilica is small, but experience and spirit of this place is unforgettable. I recommend visit this place on Brugge",
          "A beautiful chapel tucked away beside City Hall. Stained glass windows are beautifully done. The museum attached is \u20ac2.50 to enter but while very small we certainly felt it was worth it.",
          "We went just as a service had begun which was quite nice,although we did not understand it,not religious ourselves but could see it had a lot of meaning to some.",
          "We just visited the chapel. We were not interested in seeing a vial of holy blood. Very original . Check it out",
          "I stopped I just to see what was there and was surprised at how lovely it was... it's beautiful carvings, silver work and the resting place of Christ's blood is ornate adorned by two sculpted angels. Worth a short stop regardless of your religion.",
          "Don't miss the opportunity to walk into this small beautiful church, opening times are limited but such a gem.",
          "Beautifully!! Athe museum had interesting pieces and the holy blood is a great experience !!!! The line was not long at all .",
          "A really interesting place. Worth a visit for the lovely friezes and the history. A slightly annoying and overly officious woman seemed to spend her entire time shushing everyone. But her aside the church is worth a visit.",
          "The church is outstanding - so beautiful. The cloth of Christ\u2019s blood is only viewable twice a day. It says the times on the church door so be sure to go during that time as it\u2019s a remarkable sight and they allow 1 to 2 people up at a time for a donation.",
          "So much to focus on in such a small space. Very peaceful place to contemplate the importance of this holy place. Surprised to find it free to visit although a small fee is charged to enter the treasury which is also worth a visit.",
          "One of the free places to go in Bruges. The church itself is slightly hidden but it near to the square. The is a relic with the priest there. Makes it very touristy",
          "Attended the short ceremony which brought out the relic of Christ's blood. The priest gave a lecture on how this is not a tourist attraction but something they wholly believed in as a symbol of the church so keep that in mind. We attended at 2:00 and was through looking at the",
          "A very spiritually uplifting church in the corner of the Burg Square. You will find the times of the veneration of the medieval relic by the entrance. Take a little time out of you busy visit to Bruges to drop in for a few moments of peace, quiet and reflection. There is also a",
          "The entrance to the church is tucked away in a corner and can be missed very easily. Very beautiful inside. Can not see the relic unless you are there at a specific time.",
          "I'm not exactly the most devout Catholic but this experience was very moving. Well worth a visit. Just remember to not speak in the basillica. A little respect is what they ask and I think they are right.",
          "The building is small and off the main square. You wouldn't think from looking at the outside what is contained within. It is a must see. Definitely one place you should make as part of your plan while you visit Bruges",
          "As with many Catholic relics this does not chime so well in the 21st Century. However it is part of the Brugge story and takes us back to the 12 century and the growing wealth and importance of the City of Brugge. There is no cost to enter. It is worth visiting",
          "You actually get to see the holy blood. The service only starts at 2 pm everyday, so you cannot enter before that. Be there on time else you'll miss it. You are seated for about 5 minute before the actual service begins and then you take turns to go onto the platform and",
          "In a corner of the Burg, up a flight of steps. Free entry, but attached Museum has a small charge. This has to be seen for it's spectacular murals - mostly 19th century, although the building itself is much older. Do not miss.",
          "This basilica was beautiful. The Holy Blood of Christ was on display when we went. Off to the side you simply stand in line and then ascend a small platform to get a short glance at the relic. It is definitely worth the time to stop while you are walking through Bruges.",
          "This tiny church is absolutely beautiful, inside and out. You should definitely pay a visit, it will take no longer than 10-15 minutes and it is totally worth it. It is said that the blood of Jesus is kept here, it is an interesting thing. Whether you're religious/spiritual or",
          "This building is beautiful, tucked away in one corner of the Burg square. They bring the vial of blood out twice a day within the Basilica and we happened to visit on one of these occasions. You can if you so wish, donate a small amount to go up and be blessed; it does not",
          "The Basilica of the Holy Blood is a small church in the heart of Brussels that is home to the cloth used to wash the body of Jesus following the Crucifixion. The church is smaller than than main cathedrals and far different in appearance than expected. The outside walls are",
          "We didn't get any of the \"special\" things others have talked about here, so it is just a review of a pretty, small church, hidden away in the corner of Burg square. As such, I can't say there is much to see here. Bruges has more interesting churches.",
          "very beautiful church. Amazing going in and visiting. It's well worth checking out! It's also very close to Markt so not hard to get over to.",
          "This is by far one of the most beautiful churches I have ever seen, it is worth seeing. We were on time for the veneration ceremony which was nice, lasts approx 10 minutes altogether.",
          "Its a small church very close to the center of Brugge. Its beautiful inside and its free. Try to visit if you going to Brugge",
          "Beautiful chapel-like basilica where you can view the main church and view the holy blood of Jesus (matter of faith). The decorations within the basilica are worth a visit.",
          "For my filipino wife, very religious, this was the highlight of the day. The moment we were there she could touch the relic under the surveillance of a priest. No pictures allowed.",
          "What a stunning building this is! I would strongly suggest to visit this building as the craftmanship inside and out is stunning! It is free entry with a small donation if you wish so there is no reason not to go!",
          "It was worthwhile to climb the stairs to go to mass. The church opens out to a bigger space than you would expect. The interior is superb. Gold and silver but still manages a lightness and intimacy that makes reflection easy",
          "Small church that we happened to attend at the time of the holy blood blessings which made our visit even more special Tiny museum at the entrance",
          "Ceremony was in multiple languages and we timed it just as the blood was brought out. Sit on the right hand side to be first in the queue to touch it.",
          "We visited here and were struck by the magnificent facade and the interesting interior. Compared to some cathedrals, it is a bit small but the appointments inside are very beautiful. I would definitely come here when you visit Bruges.",
          "If for no other reason, visit this church for its history. It\u2019s fascinating. You can pop in for a few minutes or spend hours. The church is tucked into a corner of Burg Square. The impressive dark facade with gilded statues is actually just a connector structure that was built",
          "I would have liked to visited here when it was less busy. Despite various notices and people asking for quiet there was lots of flash photography taking place and loud talking. This was particularly true for the tour guides who insisted on continuing to talk to their groups",
          "There was long queue to get in here and it kind of built up the hype as you got near the front and watched everyone going up and viewing the vial of Jesus's blood as the Priest guarded the vial. You were expected to donate money before you stepped up to view the vial. The",
          "If in Bruges you must visit the Basilica. If you time it right & get the service this is a great experience. It is a humbling & spiritual place. Take time to light a candle & say a prayer. The blood of Christ is a historical wonder even if you are not religious. The church",
          "Keep in mind you can only see the blood between 2-4 pm, so working the rest of your day around that could be annoying. You are also not allowed to take pictures.",
          "The building exterior is beautiful and most take photos out there. The museum is a tiny little room that you pay \u20ac2.5 pp to see...maybe no larger than 15ft x 15ft? There were a few relics, stain glass and some painted panels. Save your money, take pictures of the exterior and",
          "I\u2019m not either Christian or Catholic but I obviously believe in Jesus Christ. This was an incredible sight to see, this relic and the presence of everyone in the faith. When it was my turn to go up and the priest gave me a blessing, I was incredibly overwhelmed with emotion and",
          "Viewed at 11.30 on a Tuesday we were quite underwhelmed by the place. Lovely Gregorian chant on entry, but soon realised this was piped music through speakers. Maybe we have been spoiled by Italian churches, but we feel this is somewhere for religious reflection or to pay your",
          "The basilica itself is really stunning and the atmosphere the relict puts into the basilica is amazing. This place is a must see, but I urge everybody who visits this church to NOT visit the museum, it is waste of money.",
          "The outside is very ornate. The inside- if you just go in the church part downstairs is very small and plain!",
          "Stunned by the beauty and reverence of the Basilica. A place to obtain inner calm and tranquility amongst others.",
          "Worth a stop in this small and beautifully ornate church to view an encased vile of Jesus\u2019 dried blood. We were told it is believed to be emulsified wth particles of the cross.",
          "Excellent Architecture that would compel someone to spend time in the serene environment. Be patient and can view the Holy Blood and get blesings.",
          "We literally stumbled into this chapel and we are so glad we did. Although we were not there for the \"reveal\" of the Holy Blood, we did spend nearly an hour here. What a stunningly beautiful place. I loved the Gregorian chants playing in the background. Created a total",
          "Lovely for a cool and quiet respite from the hussle and bustle of the tourist throng. Beautiful church with lovely wall paintings. Wonderful place of worship. Timeless and atmospheric",
          "Not to be disrespectful, but I don\u2019t buy the story. Apparently some guy went to fight in the crusade around the 1,100 AD and bought the blood of Christ while he was over there. They made a whole church to hold the blood hence the name. My assumption is the guy was bs-ing or he",
          "It is a small church rather chapel with nearly nothing in. In the middle there is sitting a monk and you could see Jesus\u2019 blood and you could pray. If you decide you could donate some money.",
          "This basilica is really quite small and is located on Burg Square. The basilica is run by the Catholic organization known as the Precious Blood. It contains a famous relic: a piece of the cross that Jesus nailed to as well as some of his blood. The relic is only on display",

          "The French and Belgian churches and cathedrals are to me more interesting and varied than those of the Italian cities. This is beautiful and impressive.",
          "This church has an Holy Relic of Christ's Blood which is not on display but brought out for a ceremony. Visitors approach and view the relic one at a time. A very moving ceremony, and not just for Catholics.",
          "Im not religious but a stunning interior, very peaceful and beautiful, people should observe the no photo sign though, very rude!!!!!",
          "At the top altar there is a phial brought back by a Flemish knight from the crusades and the Holy land, and that phial, its said to contain some drops of Jesus Christs blood, and this blood right, although its dry blood, at different times over many years they say it turned back",
          "The basilica was even better than imagined! It had such a fantastic atmosphere and they have done a fabulous job keeping it as it used to be.",
          "not sure how true this is but its worth visiting the chapel its lovely and you can pass your hand over the holy blood if you so wish!",
          "A must when visiting Bruges. Hidden in the corner of the square this church is a hidden gem, beautifully decorated and based around a holy relic - a glass vial of Christ's blood - the church has a real feeling of medieval mysticism but can get very busy, however, definitely work",
          "even if your not religious this church was stunning. Watching the ceremony of the blood of christ was extremley moving. The architecture was breath taking. You must also visit the chapel below from medieval times",
          "Managed to visit here while you were able to form a procession past the small vial of the blood of Christ during a mass/service.",
          "We were lucky enough to attend one of the services here and were able to see it as a working Basilica rather than just one to visit. We would also recommend that for other visitors",
          "When you enter this church dedicated to the holy blood of Christ you feel like stepping right into a painting of Rubens or Rembrandt. It\u2019s incredibly pretty and full of atmosphere. Remember to visit the chapel in the basement. Also a must-see. It\u2019s all free of charge.",
          "In one of the oldest complexes in the town, this Church is now effectively elevated accessed by stairs or elevator. A welcoming priest and church governance and a special opportunity each week to venerate the relic of the Holy Blood",
          "We came here just by chance and it really is worth finding it as it\u2019s easily missed! We just happened to arrive when they were doing a short service with the blood of Jesus , it\u2019s quiet moving and the whole little church is very bedutiful. There is a steep set of wide curved",
          "This is a great church to visit. please donate a few euros and light a candle. It is a great church!",
          "Place to think and reflect, for a small donation you may touch the glass box with capsule with some cloth presumably soaked with saviour's blood",
          "If you are in Bruges, the Basilica, is well worth a visit, the queue to touch the holy blood moved quickly, and was very well organised.",
          "It's quick and easy to see. We had a toddler that was getting fussy and they bright us to the front of the line. It is well worth the stop. Don't worry about your party, they'll accommodate.",
          "Visited the chapel with the relic of the blood of Jesus, they ask for a donation and you take turns to go up the steps to see the relic and touch the glass casing that it is in, there a 2 clerics sitting behind it. Again another very interesting must see",
          "What an amazing experience - go during the morning showing when the artifacts are first presented. Take the time to stand inline and reflect on what is taking place, before walking up to the showing. A must stop if you are a Christian!!!!",
          "Nice church. Go at around 2pm, where you can see the vial of Jesus' blood. They ask for a small donation. the ceremony is quite surreal.",
          "This is a MUST-SEE sight! This basilica has a relic of the blood of Jesus on a cloth and it facilitates prayer and the place is awe-inspiring! Perfect architecture, gorgeous interior, and feelings of satisfaction upon seeing this landmark.",
          "Great experience to see this and well worth a visit if your in the area. The church is actually on the second floor and you have to wait in line but it is well worth the wait. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "If you are Catholic or Christian this is a wonderful place to visit to see a shrine with the blood of Jesus. The church and chapel are also worth it. No cost to visit. Consider joining or getting the subscription of Pious Society Precious Blood for Euro 10. A prayer will be",
          "This place looks so small, but once you enter and wind down the staircase, it opens up into many beautiful ornate rooms. Every inch is gorgeously detailed, you really must stop in. We passed by it many times and didn't realize what it was. So glad we went!",
          "We were on a tour group which was nearly at the end of Tour of Europe when we were at Bruges and only found the Basilica of Holy Blood by chance, and I can say that this was the most unexpected surprise that we experienced on our entire 12 day trip through Europe. Well worth",
          "You can never tell with relics, but there is a certain power to saying a prayer for you loved ones over the actual blood of Christ (maybe) rather the just the wine representation of it at a \"normal\" church.",
          "the Basilica of the Holy Blood is a must see in Bruges. it has a relic of the cloth of Jesus which can be seen. The actual Basilica is beautiful. My husband was overwhelmed by the experience.",
          "We luckily managed to get in as it opened and witnessed the ceremony and got to touch the Holy blood. However the experience was soured by a very rude man working there who began to shout at me saying are you blind no photos. I innocently mistook an imagine thinking it was no",
          "Bruges has lots of churches, the holy blood church is a very peaceful place to pray. Can get very busy at weekends.",
          "We happened in on a day when the so-called holy blood was on display - our walking tour guide said only on Fridays. It was quite interesting to walk by the very stern priest watching over it to look. The church itself is just lovely. Unique, more colorful than usual stained",
          "Don't usually go in for a lot of mumbo-jumbo but there is something special about this place. Whether you are a believer or not, you will feel something...",
          "Church is open and worth seeing, but the holy relic is not on display. There\u2019s a small museum that has interesting artifacts for a small charge. Well worth the small price of admission.",
          "It's a small basilica tucked away in the corner of the plaza, a little hard to find and not what I would expect as far as the facade. Famous for having the Holy Blood. I had the opportunity to see it up close after giving a donation. I said a little prayer right in front of",
          "This lovely country-side charmed us the most during our min-Europe tour. The Basilica is a must-see monument. Regal and well-preserved over the ages. Amen.",
          "Of all the great sights in Bruges this isn't one I would visit again. It lacks character and the staff are pretty overbearing constantly telling visitors to be quiet. There are much more interesting sights to see and I would avoid this.",
          "Nice little church to visit.No charge to get in.Many steps if you choose to walk up.There is an elevator also.It is worth a short visit",
          "Its small basilica, and hard to find out at the square. I went there by chance and found its famous Basilica of the Holy Blood. Q was really small and I got to see holy blood with in 5 minutes. they gave you proper time so that you can say your personal prayer in front of holly",
          "If you are in Bruge make time to see this church. Beautiful, peaceful, reverent. Mass was spoken in 4 languages. The chapel space below the Basilica offers a quiet space for reflection as well.",
          "An inspiring place, more so for people with a faith. Inside the building is so ornate, colourful it offers a chance for some reflection...if a bit busy",
          "We didnt even know this was there....we just happened to walk in the church and saw a long line....we got right in line and saw The Holy Blood... you can sooo feel the faith...VERY happy and blessed to have seen this!",
          "The visit to view the blood soaked gauge moved me - besides the viewing we went and sat in the Church and it was very spiritual.",
          "Beautiful basilica in the Burg square. Both the exterior and the interiors are very beautiful. Has a wooden laminate on the ceiling. very quiet . was awed by the holy exhibit. A must see.",
          "Something everyone needs to see. The history here is amazing. The inside of the basilica is truly breathe taking.",
          "There was a very nice church with a lot of ornate and fancy decorations and fripperies. Standing to the side on a fancy platform with resplendent altar was a priest with the blood of Christ on display. It was oppulently presented in a scroll like tube, decadently made from gold",
          "Very beautiful church that holds a vessel containing the Sacred Blood, thus the name of the church. The renovation is almost complete so things looked very fresh. No pictures were allowed in certain areas.",
          "Arrived during mass and then watched the short procession of the Holy Blood to another area of the church. The queue to then venerate the phial moved quickly and respectfully without feeling rushed.",
          "Visited this back in March of 2018. The church itself is small, but very beautiful. This really isn't the kind of place to take photos though. I would leave the camera off and just enjoy the beauty of the church. The blood itself is up on the alter and is looked at 1 at a",
          "Worth the visit, specially if you are catholic. You do have to make a line to see, kiss the Holy Blood and donation is highly recommended.. It was a nice basilica to visit, the plaza and the outside building are also pretty nice.",
          "No lines and no photo's. If you are a believer then this is really something you need to do. you can pay any fee you want as an offering see the vile and say a prayer!",
          "I visited the Basilica of the Holy Blood today and was very impressed. The building itself is stunning and although it looks out of place on the square it shows it\u2019s age and splendour. The Holy Blood isn\u2019t always shown so make sure you do a pop in to see when it will be shown",
          "The ceremony is not designed for tourists but is a proper religious ceremony. The two basilica are impressive. The attached museum is not.",
          "The downstairs section is simpler, more like one of the very early churches. The upstairs section is elaborately decorated and quite impressive. We were there at a time when visitors had the opportunity to get close to the church's relic, a vial that supposedly contains the",
          "What an inspiring and humbling experience . When you go in, you will get in line to go up to the alter and see the vial which is said to contain the blood of Christ. You won\u2019t be allowed to take pictures of this sacred artifact but you can take pictures in the rest of the",
          "Tucked into the corner of the square it's on and overshadowed by the huge city hall next to it doesn't seem like much. 9nce inside though it's a fantastic place to see and well worth popping inside to appreciate architecture and design even if you're not religious",
          "The basilica is busy with tourist (one tourist was very loud and had to be told to keep quiet!) but it did not take away from the atmosphere of the sight. You should wait and take your turn to go and see the blood as it is a very nice moving experience.",
          "The Basilica of the Holy Blood is definitely interesting from the outside, but it would be possible to stand in the square and barely notice it. However, on the inside it is truly impressive. It is rather small and you reach it by going up some stairs. If it is the time of day",
          "Inspirational visit to the Basilica of the Holy Blood. My husband and I weren't prepared for how moving this visit would be. Even more special to have the Holy Blood on display since we visited on Friday.",
          "With map in hand we sught to find the Basilica of the Holy Blood with little help. It is tucked in the Burg square in the corner well protected from the hordes of tourists. The church is relatively small and we arrived on the Feast of the Precious Blood. This ia major",
          "Both the Basilica and the Chapel below it are beautiful, medieval churches and both felt so very sacred. It was inspiring to see the holy relic. Don't miss this if you are in Bruges.",
          "This is a beautiful basilica in the middle of Bruges. The museum is moderately priced at \u20ac2.50 which is about right. The relic of the holy blood is exposed every Sunday after the 11am Mass",
          "The ornate church belies the rather underwhelming view of the vile of blood. The wait to see the blood is the best part, as you get to enjoy the incredibly detailed paint within the chapel itself.",
          "Nice basiilica. You can visit it and see what's believed to be the rest of the holy blood (Christ). No entrance fee.",
          "This is a relatively small double church. There is an upper and lower church. The relic of Holy Blood is in the upper chapel. The upper chapel has two distinct naves, on of which displays the relic. The relic is said to contain the blood of Christ on a piece of cloth. I have",
          "Gorgeous church - you must go to upper level. Very spiritual and beautiful. Colorfully painted - a nice short retreat during a busy day touring.",
          "We went to see the relic of the holy blood. The church is very peaceful and quite beautiful in its own right. Nice place to visit if you wish to escape the tourists in the Main square.",
          "Just took a few minutes to duck into this church. We arrived shortly after 2 p.m., so the line to see the holy blood was relatively short. I did it more for the spectacle than anything else. Dropped a coin in the till and received a prayer card. The place it highly decorated.",
          "This basilica is 1000 years old, and tradition teaches that this church houses an ancient relic of the burial cloth of Jesus. Many steep stairs, no elevator available when we visited. We attended at 11 AM Mass on the upper level on a Saturday and were able to see the relic",
          "We had the 9-11 am walking tour and we couldn\u2019t experience the afternoon ritual of touching the holy blood. But we went into the church and admired the mastery created stained glass windows. Free to go in and reflect. The pews are inviting",
          "This is a smaller church, very beautiful and lovely to visit. Be careful of times as they are not open all day. Worth the wait to see it, though. There is a ceremony where they bring out the vial of Jesus' blood in a very respectful, ritualistic manner. Look for the times",
          "Whether or not religion is your thing it is difficult to not have a certain amount of awe for the Basilica of the Holy Blood - which is basically a glass tube which supposedly contains some of the blood of Christ. Whether the artefact is legitimate or not it is an interesting",
          "We only visited the little chapel that is free to go into. It was simple, plain but absolutely lovely in its simplicity. It was warm and very peaceful. A lovely place to just sit quietly.",
          "A very special experience. I definitely felt the holy spirit in this basilica. The energy as so positive and uplifting.",
          "If you go on Friday you can touch the box the holy blood is in.If the lineup is out the door, you are looking at at least an hour wait to touch the blood. If you just want to see the chapel, you can skip the line. Just let the guide know you are not lined up for the blood. If",
          "This is a beautiful church located in the historic old town in Bruge. The church houses a vessel of Christ blood, The Holy Blood. It is a worth a visit just to see the interior. The renovation is just finishing and everything s fresh and clean. Make sure you talk to any",
          "Very old church with the relic of the holy blood. There is a veneration held daily at 2 pm. It\u2019s worth seeing if you are interested in religious ceremony. The church also contains a museum. There are more amazing sights in Bruges, but the architecture of this church is pretty",
          "This is a busy Basilica but well worth a visit to see the colourful wall coverings and the beautiful stained glass. There is a small museum to see for a small charge. The crypt is also worth a visit. Very old building. It gets crowded at 11.30 for the service of kissing the",
          "On of the most Autenthic and reistijd procession I ever saw.The procession of the holy blood.Trhuly this is Bruges most beautifull day",
          "This is the most awesome and beautiful place. Lovely from the outside it is gorgeous inside. You don\u2019t have to pay to see the Church but they ask for donation if you wish to put your hand on something that claims to contain the blood of Christ (we didn\u2019t). There is a small",
          "We entered the Basilica and marvelled at its beauty. We were able to sit and refect for a few moments.",
          "If you are religious and want to lay your hands on a possible relic, join the queue. The inside of the chapel was very ornate.",
          "We spent some time visiting the Basilica of Holy Blood in Bruges during our single day trip. The outside front entry didn't look like a typical large church. Although this was not like the other big churches you see in European countries, it definitely had its own character.",
          "I hate lines but I decided to wait in one here and it's worth it. The architecture inside is incredible: stained glass, high ceilings and murals. Plus the real highlight of the attraction is getting to touch the vial of Jesus's blood (which you have to pay for but it's worth",
          "Very old church where a vial of Jesus is kept. You line up a say a short in front of vial. The outside of the Baslica as a very interesting facade black and gold",
          "This is a small and beautifully appointed church. The outside is just so beautiful but the main draw is the vial of Christ\u2019s blood. I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not drinking the kool aid on this story. Definitely something I will need to do a bit more research on before I could truly say",
          "Wonderful place to visit, you can take a look at the holy blood (which was dry and crusty!). We saw some blood which indeed looked dry and crusty... gave a nod to the priest and off we went",
          "Had to stop in to be near what they claim to be \"the blood of Christ\". Beautiful little church, can't help but feel humbled when visiting.",
          "This is an attractive church in the corner of Burg square. The main point of visiting this church is that it is said that they have a cloth that contains the blood of Jesus. This has been questioned by most historians. When in the church you can pay a donation and go up and see",
          "We are not religious but still enjoyed seeing the architect and the blood. You pay a small amount (whatever you want to pay) to go up on the little platform where the priest shows you the vial of blood.",
          "We did enjoy our visit to the Basilica of the Holy Blood and attended Mass two times. It is a relatively small church, but they do seem to balance tourism and worship. During the week the daily mass is done solely in dutch, but on Sunday they claimed to have a multi-language",
          "Attended Mass with classic choir and was lovely. The church itself is richly adorned and very nice. The special moment is seeing the vial of the blood of the Christ. You line up to venerate this. If you believe, it\u2019s awesome.",
          "Surreal and humbling experience at this wonderful Basilica. We queued up (which was quite an odd experience in a Basilica) and saw the holy blood, which was incredible and quite awe-inspiring when you consider the history behind it. The church itself is of course beautiful, but",
          "Here they claim to have a small container with Jesus' blood. If you want to see it, be aware of the schedule, it's not exhibited the whole day. The basilica in general is ok, very small and although it's shape it's not common, there is nothing outstanding here.",
          "Although it is pretty small it is worthwhile to visit it. It closes at 5:30 pm. The decorations are impressive.",
          "only open at certain times of the day. this is an experience that you should take in if you are in Bruges",
          "We visited the Basilica at 2:00 PM when the glass vial of supposed blood of Jesus Christ brought back during the Crusades. A moving experience where you get to see the glass vial close up.",
          "We went on a weekend and it was pretty busy. There was a very long line to see the vial of Holy Blood (practically all the way to the entrance door) but it did move quickly. No photos are allowed of the relic itself, but feel free to take pictures of the small church - it's",
          "a small interesting church, which houses the Cloth of the Holy Blood , a small piece of ancient cloth encased in a vial which allegedly turns to blood ! Access to the church is via a rather long but wide winding staircase .beautiful vivid red stained glass windows near the top",
          "This very small basilica is hidden in a corner of the Burg Square, you will find a little door to enter and discover this little treasure. The insides are pretty dark but this will not stop you from being amazed about the colors and the details of the decorations. In certain",
          "Worth a visit. It is a bit out if the way. Recommend that you read up before going to visit. Did not go to the museum. Go early or late to avoid tour groups",
          "Well worth a trip. Free admission to view the relic....great back story if true. Housed behind a glass case with a priest standing guard. Long waiting line but not rushed.",
          "This is free to go in for a 15 minute service - beautiful church with stain glass and gold dripping everywhere. A vial of Jesus blood is bought out and you can queue to see/touch this in a glass case. Interesting if your in the area",
          "This is at the side of town hall. Beautiful medieval decoration from outside. Very beautiful and interesting inside. Personally I don't believe that there is Christ blood in there.if there is really Christ blood it will be in the Vatican and not in a random Belgian church. But",
          "The Basilics is intricately decorated in bright colours. For the religious catholics amongst you there is also a \u2018holy relic\u2019 and you can be involved in the veneration of this, although the basilica is worth a visit religious or not as it really is beautiful.",
          "Very interesting visit. Entrance is free but you are asked to donate something if you want to. Do I know if this is the blood of Jesus, who knows there is no clear facts, but a interesting visit.",
          "We went on good Friday just before the sermon and it was very crowded. It is a very special place and the Basilica itself is worth spending time in.",
          "It\u2019s ok if you don\u2019t visit it. Jesus vail is hard to believe. I won\u2019t recommend to go out of the way to visit it.",
          "Apologies to those who don't know Laurence Llewellyn Bowen - he makes over houses on TV shows in the UK in a florid, over-the-top, blingy kind of way. This church could easily have been done by him - it's ornate in the extreme - inside, designs are so numerous and cramped it",
          "This was a beautiful building ornate with great detail, gold and history there were lots of tourist groups and so queues",
          "Not overly religious but hard not to feel moved as we joined the line to stand in front of the glass vase containing the piece of cloth covered on the Lords blood. Line moved quite quickly and was probably longer than usual as it was Easter Sunday, the most religious day in",
          "This is a must see, even if you do not believe or are not even a Christian it is still well worth a visit. The Church is so ornate and the exposition of the vile of Christ's Blood is just a thing to see. But please be respectful as this is a religious site but everyone is",
          "I am not Catholic, but my wife is, and experiencing the blood of Christ is remarkable. The assistant who was walking around angrily shushing people was not conducive to experiencing a holy moment, but I understand her reasoning. Still, the upper chapel is impressive and the",
          "Built to hold a vial of Christs's blood, allegedly recovered from a cloth used to wipe His face. It apparently regularly and reliably reliquefied on Fridays for over a century after its arrival in Bruges. Even though I found it hard to share uncritical belief, it was moving to",
          "Even if your a unbeliever you could not fail to see the beauty and history of this place . Amazing stained glass and the wooden painted statues of Christ are to be seen !",
          "What a wonderful and stunning chapel(s) ( both upstairs and downstairs). Upstairs is the reliquary of the holy blood and is just so stunning in it\u2019s decoration. A special place.",
          "Not worth visiting as the vile of blood only on display at certain times and it is not very clear when that is. It was \u20ac2 to go into a room to see a very limited selection of items which you think is where the vile of blood is but actually isn\u2019t. Very very very disappointing and",
          "when you enter this remarkable place do not doubt the faith of those who built, tend and worship here. It is a place of quiet beauty and reflection....once you can settle in yourself to overlook the busy-ness all around and the crass behaviour of the ignorant. There was a queue",
          "The altar is quite beautiful. Because I was not there during tourist season the church was not crowded. The priest brought out the holy relic and anyone who wished to pray with their hands above the relic were invited to do so.",
          "The Basilica of the Holy Blood on the Burg from Bruges, just near the Markt in the center of Bruges is a must see if you visit Bruges. On the website you find the small entree prices and also the hours of opening and when there is a Eucharistie, etc.",
          "Very nice church. Free to enter the main church, but you need to pay to see the museum part. It\u2019s very busy with visitors.The holy relic is only display during certain hours.",
          "Beautiful ancient chapel on ground floor which is very peaceful. Head upstairs to an opulent church surprisingly spacious considering the facade. The holy blood/shroud is on display if that's your thing (not mine), but the painted ceiling/columns are the highlight.",
          "If you get the times right you can see the relic of the holy blood , and attend a small service. The place is calm beutiful and very moving. You could sit here for a while in the wonderful surroundings . The times of the veneration of the relic are posted outside the building.",
          "A very humbling experience looking at this special artefact only shown on a Friday. Make sure you visit the old church downstairs.",
          "It's so beautiful even if you are not a religious person, it's definitely worth a visit. There is a sense of serenity as the music of the monks calmly welcomes you to this place of solitude. You cannot help but be moved by it.",
          "Make sure to visit both chapels. The upper one which houses the relic is astonishingly highly decorated and blingtastic. The lower one is far more austere - and in my opinion, more moving. Go when the relic is on show and you can see a piece of cloth which purports to have some",
          "worth a visit ..no queues .. very central to other attractions . can combine this with canal boat trip which you can board 5 minutes away",
          "This location is a must have seen / visited when you are visiting Bruges, its in the middle in the town, so you cann't missing it!",
          "It is a really peaceful place located in Burg\u00b4s square. The entrance in the left leads you to a really quiet place for praying.",
          "A beautiful basilica built in the 12th century, looks ornate and stands out in the corner of the square. Equally as stunning inside. It closes between 1230 and 230pm or at least it did the Sunday I was there so get there in the morning is my tip It's only small and up a few",
          "When checking how we can discover few nice spots of the Brugge in just few hours and by night, I see Basilica of yhe Joly Blood in photos and deeply wish to see it. After dinner, we were tired and walking back to the hotel, suddenly I see the Basilica in front of us. Just w said",
          "Our walking tour guide took us to this place , the basilica is very sacred as it houses the blood stained cloth of Christ. There is a small treasury museum in the first floor with the rich ornamental and precious treasures and valuables and historical holy collectibles in it.",
          "architecture very special for this place, but when you enter it, you can feel the atmosphere is very peaceful. You have the possibility to see the relic presented by a priest. Don\"t forget to go to the chapel at the ground floor, where you can see a very simple place, but still",
          "Great religious exhibits and history. There was a special video animation on the second level which was mesmerising. Do not miss",
          "I didn't even know that there was a cloth with Christ's Blood on it... but there is in this Basilica. So a little trick that we learned... they close for lunch until 12:30.... if you get in line at 12:15... there's NO ONE!!!! We got right in, were able to put our hands on the",
          "Heiling Bloedbasiliek close to the Burg which in English is the Basilica of the Holy Blood, a well restored chapel, has a phial of blood said be to Christ's brought back from the crusades. Well worth a visit and can get ridiculously busy, even out of season.",
          "This Basilica would stand out anywhere. I was literally drawn to it. 12th century Thierry of Alsace brought back the relic of the Precious Blood after his second (of four) crusade. This Romanesque (rounded arches) half of the double chapel is simple, muscular and powerful in",
          "I am not religious but was simply wanting to explore whilst it was raining. The building is so beautiful even by church standards. Entry was free, a small donation was asked if visiting the priest to see Christs Blood etc. Definately a must visit.",
          "This Basilica is understated, hard to find in a small corner of the square but worth every moment it took you to get here. The alter is beautiful. The relic. Is amazing, simply put. You will never see this anywhere else.",
          "There\u2019s nothing interesting about this Basilica. The inside it\u2019s very common and nothing special. Save time and skip this place, use your time to enjoy the beauty of this magnificent city.",
          "Very cool interior. Free entry. They had the holy blood on display when we went even though it wasn\u2019t during the times listed on the website.",
          "Found it hard to find at first, it\u2019s kind of tucked away, and from the outside does not look like a typical European church. The church is small but very nice. Worth seeing if you\u2019re into historic churches.",
          "We recently visited the Basilica and it was everything week expected, beautiful architecture, stunning stained glass windows and fabulous from top to bottom. What I didn't expect from somewhere that was fairly busy was the overwhelming feeling of peace and tranquillity. The",
          "The upper and lower chapel are absolutely amazing, the church was built in 1134, and has been very well preserved. It was quite busy as we were there during school holidays, but it was really well worth the visit. Very gothic architecture is stunning, and well worth the visit.",
          "This place was just so amazing. Beautiful architecture and evokes such a sense of emotion when you go inside. The relic itself was just fascinating to look at. A must- see in Bruges!",
          "Slightly biased review as I have no religious beliefs so found the experience underwhelming. Architecture was cool to look. There was a small room filled with some artefacts and interesting things but spent no more than 30 mins in total (15 of which was queuing!)",
          "We discovered this whilst on a first evening wander and found it's peace and tranquillity very calming. Some of the wall paintings were a bit out of place as they are obviously 'Arts and Crafts' but the pulpit is quite remarkable. The stairs up to the chapel are incredibly",
          "My wife and I visited this (June 2016) when on a day excursion from our Russia and Scandinavia Baltic cruise on Celebrity Eclipse. 'Tucked away' in a corner of Burg square, this Roman Catholic minor basilica was originally built in the 12th century as the chapel of the residence",
          "I went to Bruges in January as part of my Christmas present to my sister. A visit to the Basilica of the Holy Blood was no.1 on her list of things she wanted to do. Our hotel was just across the road from the entrance to the Basilica. We decided to go and visit on our last",
          "With thousand similar churches in Belgium, the Basilica of The Holy Blood is one that truly differs from the rest. Small, intimate and peaceful, it really stands out from all other churches which you have visited or will visit in the future.",
          "This church is sort of small compared to others in the city. The main draw is to see the blood. The 'service' is at 10 and 2 and there is a short prayer before you get in line to take turns touching the case with the blood in it and offer your own silent prayer. You aren't",
          "We happened to be there when the phial of the holy blood was celebrated in a short service. Unusual interior with art deco style pulpit.",
          "A nice church to pop into when in the square. I\u2019m not too sure about the relic and it\u2019s \u201csmall charge\u201d. The priest in charge looked more like a guard!!",
          "We visited this stunning building although we didn\u2019t go up to see the blood. We did sit and enjoy the decor. Lots of people taking pictures despite the many no photos signs.",
          "We visited the Basilica in June 2017 after dining in the beautiful courtyard adjacent to the church. We lined up - I think the earlier the better and viewed the phial before donating and lighting a candle in memory of my grandmother. A lovely experience & must do in Brugges.",
          "Tucked away in a corner of the Burg the Basilica is worth a visit . It houses the relic of the Holy Blood and the interior of the Basilica itself is worth seeing too.",
          "Please do not miss to meet the beautiful mother Mary, the lay outs, the princess and the prince laid on gold, the under foot passage, to see the image on a reversed mirror, the tranquil chappel, the small temple like room, the services.",
          "Wonderful historic site. No the blood did not turn to liquid whilst we were there, but just in terms of veneration, it is a 'must do' site. A service is held every afternoon to allow pilgrims to kiss the venerated glass phial. Entry is free",
          "A special impression is given by the Basilica of the Holy Blood on the right hand corner as we see the Town Hall. It is the most important church in Bruges. It has one of the most sacred relics. The fa\u00e7ade of the basilica is decorated with gilded statues. The basilica consists",
          "Tucked away in the corner of a square, it could be easy to miss, and that would be a shame, if like architecture and symbols then this would be a catastrophe. I am not a Catholic, so many of the Catholic Churches I have seen on my travels are really spellbinding to see. But this",
          "This is a gorgeous church with an amazing history. Whatever your personal beliefs, the architecture, grandeur and atmosphere are amazing. You are able to view the vile of blood, you don\u2019t need to book ahead but at popular times it can get very busy and a long queue forms. Go in,",
          "We had no idea this was here..its free to enter and you can see the famous relic .... a vial containing Jesus' blood. Worth a trip regardless of your religious belief ... but be respectful; people are seriously worshipping here.",
          "Lovely church. The whole vial thing is a tad dubious.... really? Anyway, nice thing to do. We did this as a bit of box ticking exercise - if your time is limited - then you haven\u2019t missed much.....",
          "Very peaceful inside , with beautiful vaulted and painted ceilings, and at certain times there Is a choir here, though We missed it..,and it free \ud83d\ude0a",
          "The basilica upstairs is very pretty with colorful wall paintings and stained glass windows from various time periods. If you come for the service to see the Holy Blood it takes about 5 minutes or less and you line up and give a small donation and can one at a time go on the",
          "Although the actual reliquary is not visible, the interior of the church is magnificently ornamented, and well worth a visti.",
          "Visited here at the beginning of January. You go up a staircase to enter the Basilica on the second floor. Very impressive inside and not huge in comparison to other Basilicas that I have visited. Being on the tourist map the Basilica was very busy. Some people should look at",
          "I am a believer, but this display of medieval piety, complete with a stone-faced uniformed priest/guardian and an obligatory on-your-knees worship position to view the relic, is a hair-raising throwback to the Dark Ages. The chapel itself is a lovely place, in need of a good",
          "I read about the basilica a long time ago but didn\u2019t know (or more likely forgot) that it was in Brugge so I was pleasantly surprised to come across it just a short walk from my hotel. The interior of the basilica is beautiful and there is a small elevated altar off to the side;",
          "Very historic and recommended to visit when in Bruges. THe building is very old and great architecture. Just don't try to take photos of the Holy Blood area, they get very angry!",
          "This is a really old church and the inside is very mediaeval. You can make a donation and see the holy blood of Christ",
          "Very impressive church on the square and at certain times they bring out the blood relic and for a small donation you can go up to see it close up",
          "This is a beautiful church in and out but since i have seen the big and more intricate cgurches in Ghent i seem to have bench marked them for all the further churches i see. Very quite and spiritual place.",
          "You can view the holy blood for just a small donation at the back of the church. When viewing the holy blood you are very close to it and can see all details of it! The church is beautiful. We visited here twice while in Bruges.",
          "A Very quaint & charming Church , with several different areas to reflect. Was there on the unveiling of the \"Holy Blood\" Relic ceremony and was happy to watch the faithful. The order is an obscure deity and not fully acknowledged by the Vatican ! I read the info on the boards"

        "wiki": "Graz ( GRAHTS, German: [\u0261\u0281a\u02d0ts] (listen); Slovene: Gradec) is the capital city of Styria and Austria's second-largest city after Vienna. As of 1 January 2019, Graz had a population of 328,276 (292,269 of whom had principal-residence status). In 2015, the population of the Graz larger urban zone (LUZ) stood at 633,168, based on principal-residence status. Graz has a long tradition as a seat of higher education. It has four colleges and four universities with more than 60,000 students. Its historic centre  (Altstadt) is one of the best-preserved city centres in Central Europe.For centuries, Graz was more important to Slovenes and Croats, both politically and culturally, than the capitals of Ljubljana, Slovenia and Zagreb, Croatia; it remains influential to this day. In 1999, the city's historic centre was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites and in 2010 the designation was expanded to include Eggenberg Palace (German: Schloss Eggenberg) on the western edge of the city. Graz was designated the Cultural Capital of Europe in 2003 and became a City of Culinary Delights in 2008.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name of the city, Graz, formerly spelled Gratz, most likely stems from the Slavic gradec, which means \"small castle\". Some archaeological finds point to the erection of a small castle by Alpine Slavic people, which over time became a heavily defended fortification. In literary Slovene and Croatian, gradec still means \"small castle\", forming a hypocoristic derivative of Proto-West-South Slavic *grad\u044cc\u044a, whichs descends via liquid metathesis from Common Slavic *gard\u044cc\u044a and via the Slavic third palatalisation from Proto-Slavic *gardiku, originally denoting \"small town, settlement\". The name thus follows the common South Slavic pattern for naming settlements as grad. The German name 'Graz' first appears in records in 1128.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGraz is situated on both sides of the Mur river in southeast Austria. It is about 200 km (120 mi) southwest of Vienna (Wien). The nearest larger urban centre is Maribor (Marburg) in Slovenia, which is about 50 km (31 mi) to the south. Graz is the state capital and largest city in Styria, a green and heavily forested region on the eastern edge of the Alps.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring municipalities ===\nThese towns and villages border Graz:\n\nto the north: Gratkorn, Stattegg, Weinitzen\nto the east: Kainbach bei Graz, Hart bei Graz, Raaba\nto the south: G\u00f6ssendorf, Feldkirchen bei Graz, Seiersberg\nto the west: Attendorf, Thal, Judendorf-Stra\u00dfengel\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nGraz is divided into 17 municipal districts (Stadtbezirke):\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement on the ground of the modern city of Graz dates back to the Copper Age. However, no historical continuity exists of a settlement before the Middle Ages.\nDuring the 12th century, dukes under Babenberg rule made the town into an important commercial center. Later, Graz came under the rule of the Habsburgs and, in 1281, gained special privileges from King Rudolph I.\nIn the 14th century, Graz became the city of residence of the Inner Austrian line of the Habsburgs. The royalty lived in the Schlossberg castle and from there ruled Styria, Carinthia, most of today's Slovenia, and parts of Italy (Carniola, Gorizia and Gradisca, Trieste).\nIn the 16th century, the city's design and planning were primarily controlled by Italian Renaissance architects and artists. One of the most famous buildings representative of this style is the Landhaus, designed by Domenico dell'Allio, and used by the local rulers as a governmental headquarters.\n\nThe University of Graz was founded by Archduke Karl II in 1585, it's the city's oldest university. For most of its existence, it was controlled by the Catholic church, and was closed in 1782 by Joseph II in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a lyceum where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-established as a university by Emperor Franz I, and was named 'Karl-Franzens Universit\u00e4t' or 'Charles-Francis University' in English. More than 30,000 students are currently enrolled at this university.\nThe astronomer Johannes Kepler lived in Graz for a short period. He worked as a math teacher and was a professor of mathematics at the University of Graz, but still found time to study astronomy. He left Graz for Prague when Lutherans were banned from the city.\nLudwig Boltzmann was Professor for Mathematical Physics from 1869 to 1890. During that time, Nikola Tesla studied electrical engineering at the Polytechnic in 1875. Nobel Laureate Otto Loewi taught at the University of Graz from 1909 until 1938. Ivo Andric, the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature Laureate obtained his doctorate at the University of Graz. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger was briefly chancellor of the University of Graz in 1936.\nGraz is centrally located within today's Bundesland (state) of Styria, or Steiermark in German. Mark is an old German word indicating a large area of land used as a defensive border, in which the peasantry is taught how to organize and fight in the case of an invasion. With a strategic location at the head of the open and fertile Mur valley, Graz was historically a target of invaders, such as the Hungarians under Matthias Corvinus in 1481, and the Ottoman Turks in 1529 and 1532. Apart from the Riegersburg Castle, the Schlossberg was the only fortification in the region that never fell to the Ottoman Turks. Graz is home to the region's provincial armory, which is the world's largest historical collection of late medieval and Renaissance weaponry. It has been preserved since 1551, and displays over 30,000 items.\nFrom the earlier part of the 15th century, Graz was the residence of the younger branch of the Habsburgs, which succeeded to the imperial throne in 1619 in the person of Emperor Ferdinand II, who moved the capital to Vienna. New fortifications were built on the Schlossberg at the end of the 16th century. Napoleon's army occupied Graz in 1797. In 1809, the city withstood another assault by the French army. During this attack, the commanding officer in the fortress was ordered to defend it with about 900 men against Napoleon's army of about 3,000. He successfully defended the Schlossberg against eight attacks, but they were forced to give up after the Grande Arm\u00e9e occupied Vienna and the Emperor ordered to surrender. Following the defeat of Austria by Napoleonic forces at the Battle of Wagram in 1809, the fortifications were demolished using explosives, as stipulated in the Peace of Sch\u00f6nbrunn of the same year. The belltower (Glockenturm) and the civic clock tower (Uhrturm), which is a leading tourist attraction and serves as a symbol for Graz, were spared after the citizens of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation.Archduke Karl II of Inner Austria had 20,000 Protestant books burned in the square of what is now a mental hospital, and succeeded in returning Styria to the authority of the Holy See. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was born in Graz in what is now the Stadtmuseum (city museum).\n\n\n== Population development ==\nThe more recent population figures do not give the whole picture as only people with principal-residence status are counted and people with secondary residence status are not. Most of the people with secondary residence status in Graz are students. At the end of 2016 there were 33,473 people with secondary residence status in Graz.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nOceanic climate is the type found in the city, but due to the 0 \u00b0C isotherm, the same occurs in a humid continental climate with based in K\u00f6ppen system (Cfb/Dfb borderline). Wladimir K\u00f6ppen himself was in town and conducted studies to see how the climate of the past influenced the Continental Drift theory. Due to its position southeast of the Alps, Graz is shielded from the prevailing westerly winds that bring weather fronts in from the North Atlantic to northwestern and central Europe. The weather in Graz is thus influenced by the Mediterranean, and it has more hours of sunshine per year than Vienna or Salzburg and also less wind or rain. Graz lies in a basin that is only open to the south, causing the climate to be warmer than would be expected at that latitude. Plants are found in Graz that normally grow much further south.\n\naverage temperatures: Graz Airport 8.7 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) / Karl-Franzens University 9.4 \u00b0C (49 \u00b0F)\naverage rainfall: 818 mm (32 in) with on average 92 days of rain (Karl Franzens University)\naverage hours of sunshine: 1,989 (Karl Franzens University)\n\n\n== Slovenes and Graz ==\nPolitically, culturally, scientifically and religiously, Graz was an important centre for all Slovenes, especially from the establishment of the University of Graz in 1586 until the establishment of University of Ljubljana in 1919. In 1574, the first Slovene Catholic book was published in Graz, and in 1592, Hieronymus Megiser published in Graz the book Dictionarium quatuor linguarum, the first multilingual dictionary of Slovene.The Styrian Slovenes did not consider Graz a German-speaking city, but their own, a place to study while living at their relatives' homes and to fulfill one's career ambitions. The student associations in Graz were a crucible of the Slovene identity, and the Slovene students in Graz were more nationally aware than some others. This led to fierce anti-Slovene efforts of German-speaking nationalists in Graz before and during World War II.Many Slovenian Styrians study there. Slovenes are among the professors at the Institute for Jazz in Graz. Numerous Slovenes have found employment there, while being formerly unemployed in Slovenia. For the Slovene culture, Graz remains permanently important due to its university and the Universalmuseum Joanneum archives containing numerous documents from the Slovenian Styria.A symposium on the relation of Graz and the Slovenes was held in Graz in 2010, at the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the first and oldest chair of Slovene. It was established at the Lyzeum of Graz in July 1811 on the initiative of Janez Nepomuk Primic. A collection of lectures on the topic was published. The Slovenian Post commemorated the anniversary with a stamp.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nFor the year that Graz was Cultural Capital of Europe, new structures were erected. The Graz Museum of Contemporary Art (German: Kunsthaus) was designed by Peter Cook and Colin Fournier and is situated next to the Mur river. The Island in the Mur is a floating platform made of steel. It was designed by American architect Vito Acconci and contains a caf\u00e9, an open-air theatre and a playground.\n\n\n=== Historic city centre ===\n\nThe historic centre was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999 due to the harmonious co-existence of typical buildings from different epochs and in different architectural styles. Situated in a cultural borderland between Central Europe, Italy and the Balkan States, Graz absorbed various influences from the neighbouring regions and thus received its exceptional townscape. Today the historic centre consists of over 1,000 buildings, their age ranging from Gothic to contemporary.\nThe most important sights in the historic centre are:\n\nTown Hall (Rathaus).\nThe Castle hill (German: Schlossberg), a hill dominating the historic centre (475 m (1,558.40 ft) high), site of a demolished fortress, with views over Graz.\nThe Clock Tower (Uhrturm) is a symbol of Graz, at the top of the Castle hill.\nThe New Gallery (Neue Galerie), a museum of art.\nThe Castle hill funicular (Schlossbergbahn), a funicular railway on the Castle hill's slope.\nThe seat of Styria's provincial parliament (Landhaus), a palace in Lombardic style. It is one of the most important examples of Renaissance architecture in Austria and was built by Italian architect Domenico dell'Allio between 1557 and 1565.\nThe Armoury (Landeszeughaus) is the largest of its kind in the world.\nThe Graz Opera House (Opernhaus), the principal venue for opera, ballet, and operetta performances. It is the 2nd largest opera house in Austria.\nThe Graz Theatre (Schauspielhaus), Graz's principal theatre for productions of plays.\nThe Cathedral (Dom), a rare monument of Gothic architecture. Once, there were many frescos on the outer walls; today, only a few remain, like the Landplagenbild (\"picture of plagues\") painted in 1485, presumably by Thomas von Villach. The three plagues it depicts are locusts, pestilence and the invasion of the Turks, all of them striking the town in 1480. It features the oldest painted view of Graz.\nThe mausoleum of Emperor Ferdinand II next to the cathedral, the most important building of Mannerism in Graz. It includes both the grave where Ferdinand II and his wife are buried, and a church dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria.\nThe Castle (Burg), with Gothic double staircase, built between 1438 and 1453 by Emperor Frederick III, because the old castle on the Schlossberg hill was too small and uncomfortable. The castle remained the residence of the Inner Austrian Court until 1619. Today, it serves as residence for the Styrian government.\nThe Painted House (Gemaltes Haus) in Herrengasse 3. It is completely covered with frescos (painted in 1742 by Johann Mayer).\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art Graz (Kunsthaus)\nThe Island in the Mur (Murinsel), an artificial island in the Mur river.\nBuildings, inner courtyards (e. g. Early Renaissance courtyard of the Former House of Teutonic Knights in Sporgasse 22) and roofscape of the old town.\n\n\n=== Outside the historic city centre ===\n\nEggenberg Palace (Schloss Eggenberg) a baroque palace on the western edge of Graz with State rooms and museum.

In the outer districts buildings are predominantly of the architectural styles from the second half of the 20th century.\nIn 1965 the Grazer Schule (School of Graz) was founded. Several buildings around the universities are of this style, for example the green houses by Volker Giencke and the RESOWI center by G\u00fcnther Domenig.\nBefore Graz became the European Capital of Culture in 2003, several new projects were realized, such as the Stadthalle, the Kindermuseum (museum for children), the Helmut-List-Halle, the Kunsthaus and the Murinsel.\n\nTallest buildings\nBuildings in Graz which are at least 50m tall: \n\n\n=== Sports ===\nSK Sturm Graz is the main football club of the city, with three Austrian championships and five runner-up seasons.

Events have been held at different venues in Graz and in the surrounding region.\n\n\n=== Dialect ===\nReferred to as Steirisch by locals, Graz belongs to the Austro-Bavarian region of dialects, more specifically a mix of Central Bavarian in the western part of Styria and Southern Bavarian in the eastern part. The Grazer ORF, the Graz subsidiary of Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, launched an initiative in 2008 called Scho wieda Steirisch g'redt in order to highlight the numerous dialects of Graz and Styria in general and to cultivate the pride many Styrians hold for their local culture. Two reasons for a melding of these dialects with Standard German: the influence of television and radio bringing Standard German into the home and the industrialization causing the disappearance of the single farmer since the farming communities are seen as the true keepers of dialect speaking.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nAn extensive public transport network makes Graz an easy city to navigate without a car. The city has a comprehensive bus network, complementing the Graz tram network consisting of eight lines. Four lines pass through the underground tram stop at the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof) and on to the city centre before branching out. Furthermore, there are seven night-time bus routes, although these run only at weekends and on evenings preceding public holidays.\nThe Schlossbergbahn, a funicular railway, and the Schlossberg lift, a vertical lift, link the city centre to the Schlossberg.\nFrom the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), regional trains link to most of Styria. Direct trains run to most major cities nearby including Vienna, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Maribor and Ljubljana in Slovenia, Zagreb in Croatia, Budapest in Hungary, Prague and Brno in the Czech Republic, Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland, as well as Munich, Stuttgart, Heidelberg, and Frankfurt in Germany. Trains for Vienna leave every hour. In recent years many railway stations within the city limits and in the suburbs have been rebuilt or modernised and are now part of the \"S-Bahn Graz\", a commuter train service connecting the city with its suburban area and towns nearby.\nGraz airport is located about 10 km (6 mi) south of the city centre and is accessible by bus, railway, and car. Direct destinations include Amsterdam, Berlin, D\u00fcsseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart, Istanbul, Vienna and Zurich.\n\n\n== Health ==\nIn Graz there are seven hospitals, several private hospitals and sanatoriums, as well as 44 pharmacies.\nThe University Hospital Graz (LKH-Universit\u00e4ts-Klinikum Graz) is located in eastern Graz and has 1,556 beds and 7,190 employees. The Regional Hospital Graz II (LKH Graz II) has two sites in Graz.

Perpetually two emergency doctor's cars (NEF \u2013 Notarzteinsatzfahrzeug), two NAWs (Notarztwagen \u2013 ambulances staffed with a physician in addition to regular personnel) and about 30 RTWs (Rettungswagen \u2013 regular ambulances) are on standby. Furthermore, several non-emergency ambulances (KTW \u2013 Krankentransportwagen) and a Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) are operated by the Red Cross to transport non-emergency patients to and between hospitals. In addition to the Red Cross, the Labourers'-Samaritan-Alliance (Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund \u00d6sterreichs), the Austrian organisation of the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps (Malteser Hospitaldienst Austria) and the Green Cross (Gr\u00fcnes Kreuz) operate ambulances (KTW) for non-emergency patient transport. In addition to the cars, there's also the C12 air ambulance helicopter stationed at Graz airport, staffed with an emergency physician in addition to regular personnel.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nGraz is twinned with:\n\nOther forms of cooperation and city friendship similar to the twin city programmes\n Ni\u0161, Serbia\n Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nThe following are past and present notable residents of Graz.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Austria portal\nList of World Heritage Sites in Austria\nKastner & \u00d6hler\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"Graz: Stadtplanung und Stadtentwicklung (Rechnungshofbericht, 2006) in German\" (PDF). 2006.

        "wiki": "Graz ( GRAHTS, German: [\u0261\u0281a\u02d0ts] (listen); Slovene: Gradec) is the capital city of Styria and Austria's second-largest city after Vienna. As of 1 January 2019, Graz had a population of 328,276 (292,269 of whom had principal-residence status). In 2015, the population of the Graz larger urban zone (LUZ) stood at 633,168, based on principal-residence status. Graz has a long tradition as a seat of higher education. It has four colleges and four universities with more than 60,000 students. Its historic centre  (Altstadt) is one of the best-preserved city centres in Central Europe.For centuries, Graz was more important to Slovenes and Croats, both politically and culturally, than the capitals of Ljubljana, Slovenia and Zagreb, Croatia; it remains influential to this day. In 1999, the city's historic centre was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites and in 2010 the designation was expanded to include Eggenberg Palace (German: Schloss Eggenberg) on the western edge of the city. Graz was designated the Cultural Capital of Europe in 2003 and became a City of Culinary Delights in 2008.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name of the city, Graz, formerly spelled Gratz, most likely stems from the Slavic gradec, which means \"small castle\". Some archaeological finds point to the erection of a small castle by Alpine Slavic people, which over time became a heavily defended fortification. In literary Slovene and Croatian, gradec still means \"small castle\", forming a hypocoristic derivative of Proto-West-South Slavic *grad\u044cc\u044a, whichs descends via liquid metathesis from Common Slavic *gard\u044cc\u044a and via the Slavic third palatalisation from Proto-Slavic *gardiku, originally denoting \"small town, settlement\". The name thus follows the common South Slavic pattern for naming settlements as grad. The German name 'Graz' first appears in records in 1128.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGraz is situated on both sides of the Mur river in southeast Austria. It is about 200 km (120 mi) southwest of Vienna (Wien). The nearest larger urban centre is Maribor (Marburg) in Slovenia, which is about 50 km (31 mi) to the south. Graz is the state capital and largest city in Styria, a green and heavily forested region on the eastern edge of the Alps.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring municipalities ===\nThese towns and villages border Graz:\n\nto the north: Gratkorn, Stattegg, Weinitzen\nto the east: Kainbach bei Graz, Hart bei Graz, Raaba\nto the south: G\u00f6ssendorf, Feldkirchen bei Graz, Seiersberg\nto the west: Attendorf, Thal, Judendorf-Stra\u00dfengel\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nGraz is divided into 17 municipal districts (Stadtbezirke):\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement on the ground of the modern city of Graz dates back to the Copper Age. However, no historical continuity exists of a settlement before the Middle Ages.\nDuring the 12th century, dukes under Babenberg rule made the town into an important commercial center. Later, Graz came under the rule of the Habsburgs and, in 1281, gained special privileges from King Rudolph I.\nIn the 14th century, Graz became the city of residence of the Inner Austrian line of the Habsburgs. The royalty lived in the Schlossberg castle and from there ruled Styria, Carinthia, most of today's Slovenia, and parts of Italy (Carniola, Gorizia and Gradisca, Trieste).\nIn the 16th century, the city's design and planning were primarily controlled by Italian Renaissance architects and artists. One of the most famous buildings representative of this style is the Landhaus, designed by Domenico dell'Allio, and used by the local rulers as a governmental headquarters.\n\nThe University of Graz was founded by Archduke Karl II in 1585, it's the city's oldest university. For most of its existence, it was controlled by the Catholic church, and was closed in 1782 by Joseph II in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a lyceum where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-established as a university by Emperor Franz I, and was named 'Karl-Franzens Universit\u00e4t' or 'Charles-Francis University' in English. More than 30,000 students are currently enrolled at this university.\nThe astronomer Johannes Kepler lived in Graz for a short period. He worked as a math teacher and was a professor of mathematics at the University of Graz, but still found time to study astronomy. He left Graz for Prague when Lutherans were banned from the city.\nLudwig Boltzmann was Professor for Mathematical Physics from 1869 to 1890. During that time, Nikola Tesla studied electrical engineering at the Polytechnic in 1875. Nobel Laureate Otto Loewi taught at the University of Graz from 1909 until 1938. Ivo Andric, the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature Laureate obtained his doctorate at the University of Graz. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger was briefly chancellor of the University of Graz in 1936.\nGraz is centrally located within today's Bundesland (state) of Styria, or Steiermark in German. Mark is an old German word indicating a large area of land used as a defensive border, in which the peasantry is taught how to organize and fight in the case of an invasion. With a strategic location at the head of the open and fertile Mur valley, Graz was historically a target of invaders, such as the Hungarians under Matthias Corvinus in 1481, and the Ottoman Turks in 1529 and 1532. Apart from the Riegersburg Castle, the Schlossberg was the only fortification in the region that never fell to the Ottoman Turks. Graz is home to the region's provincial armory, which is the world's largest historical collection of late medieval and Renaissance weaponry. It has been preserved since 1551, and displays over 30,000 items.\nFrom the earlier part of the 15th century, Graz was the residence of the younger branch of the Habsburgs, which succeeded to the imperial throne in 1619 in the person of Emperor Ferdinand II, who moved the capital to Vienna. New fortifications were built on the Schlossberg at the end of the 16th century. Napoleon's army occupied Graz in 1797. In 1809, the city withstood another assault by the French army. During this attack, the commanding officer in the fortress was ordered to defend it with about 900 men against Napoleon's army of about 3,000. He successfully defended the Schlossberg against eight attacks, but they were forced to give up after the Grande Arm\u00e9e occupied Vienna and the Emperor ordered to surrender. Following the defeat of Austria by Napoleonic forces at the Battle of Wagram in 1809, the fortifications were demolished using explosives, as stipulated in the Peace of Sch\u00f6nbrunn of the same year. The belltower (Glockenturm) and the civic clock tower (Uhrturm), which is a leading tourist attraction and serves as a symbol for Graz, were spared after the citizens of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation.Archduke Karl II of Inner Austria had 20,000 Protestant books burned in the square of what is now a mental hospital, and succeeded in returning Styria to the authority of the Holy See. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was born in Graz in what is now the Stadtmuseum (city museum).\n\n\n== Population development ==\nThe more recent population figures do not give the whole picture as only people with principal-residence status are counted and people with secondary residence status are not. Most of the people with secondary residence status in Graz are students. At the end of 2016 there were 33,473 people with secondary residence status in Graz.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nOceanic climate is the type found in the city, but due to the 0 \u00b0C isotherm, the same occurs in a humid continental climate with based in K\u00f6ppen system (Cfb/Dfb borderline). Wladimir K\u00f6ppen himself was in town and conducted studies to see how the climate of the past influenced the Continental Drift theory. Due to its position southeast of the Alps, Graz is shielded from the prevailing westerly winds that bring weather fronts in from the North Atlantic to northwestern and central Europe. The weather in Graz is thus influenced by the Mediterranean, and it has more hours of sunshine per year than Vienna or Salzburg and also less wind or rain. Graz lies in a basin that is only open to the south, causing the climate to be warmer than would be expected at that latitude. Plants are found in Graz that normally grow much further south.\n\naverage temperatures: Graz Airport 8.7 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) / Karl-Franzens University 9.4 \u00b0C (49 \u00b0F)\naverage rainfall: 818 mm (32 in) with on average 92 days of rain (Karl Franzens University)\naverage hours of sunshine: 1,989 (Karl Franzens University)\n\n\n== Slovenes and Graz ==\nPolitically, culturally, scientifically and religiously, Graz was an important centre for all Slovenes, especially from the establishment of the University of Graz in 1586 until the establishment of University of Ljubljana in 1919. In 1574, the first Slovene Catholic book was published in Graz, and in 1592, Hieronymus Megiser published in Graz the book Dictionarium quatuor linguarum, the first multilingual dictionary of Slovene.The Styrian Slovenes did not consider Graz a German-speaking city, but their own, a place to study while living at their relatives' homes and to fulfill one's career ambitions. The student associations in Graz were a crucible of the Slovene identity, and the Slovene students in Graz were more nationally aware than some others. This led to fierce anti-Slovene efforts of German-speaking nationalists in Graz before and during World War II.Many Slovenian Styrians study there. Slovenes are among the professors at the Institute for Jazz in Graz. Numerous Slovenes have found employment there, while being formerly unemployed in Slovenia. For the Slovene culture, Graz remains permanently important due to its university and the Universalmuseum Joanneum archives containing numerous documents from the Slovenian Styria.A symposium on the relation of Graz and the Slovenes was held in Graz in 2010, at the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the first and oldest chair of Slovene. It was established at the Lyzeum of Graz in July 1811 on the initiative of Janez Nepomuk Primic. A collection of lectures on the topic was published. The Slovenian Post commemorated the anniversary with a stamp.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nFor the year that Graz was Cultural Capital of Europe, new structures were erected. The Graz Museum of Contemporary Art (German: Kunsthaus) was designed by Peter Cook and Colin Fournier and is situated next to the Mur river. The Island in the Mur is a floating platform made of steel. It was designed by American architect Vito Acconci and contains a caf\u00e9, an open-air theatre and a playground.\n\n\n=== Historic city centre ===\n\nThe historic centre was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999 due to the harmonious co-existence of typical buildings from different epochs and in different architectural styles. Situated in a cultural borderland between Central Europe, Italy and the Balkan States, Graz absorbed various influences from the neighbouring regions and thus received its exceptional townscape. Today the historic centre consists of over 1,000 buildings, their age ranging from Gothic to contemporary.\nThe most important sights in the historic centre are:\n\nTown Hall (Rathaus).\nThe Castle hill (German: Schlossberg), a hill dominating the historic centre (475 m (1,558.40 ft) high), site of a demolished fortress, with views over Graz.\nThe Clock Tower (Uhrturm) is a symbol of Graz, at the top of the Castle hill.\nThe New Gallery (Neue Galerie), a museum of art.\nThe Castle hill funicular (Schlossbergbahn), a funicular railway on the Castle hill's slope.\nThe seat of Styria's provincial parliament (Landhaus), a palace in Lombardic style.

It is the 2nd largest opera house in Austria.\nThe Graz Theatre (Schauspielhaus), Graz's principal theatre for productions of plays.\nThe Cathedral (Dom), a rare monument of Gothic architecture. Once, there were many frescos on the outer walls; today, only a few remain, like the Landplagenbild (\"picture of plagues\") painted in 1485, presumably by Thomas von Villach. The three plagues it depicts are locusts, pestilence and the invasion of the Turks, all of them striking the town in 1480. It features the oldest painted view of Graz.\nThe mausoleum of Emperor Ferdinand II next to the cathedral, the most important building of Mannerism in Graz. It includes both the grave where Ferdinand II and his wife are buried, and a church dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria.\nThe Castle (Burg), with Gothic double staircase, built between 1438 and 1453 by Emperor Frederick III, because the old castle on the Schlossberg hill was too small and uncomfortable. The castle remained the residence of the Inner Austrian Court until 1619. Today, it serves as residence for the Styrian government.\nThe Painted House (Gemaltes Haus) in Herrengasse 3. It is completely covered with frescos (painted in 1742 by Johann Mayer).\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art Graz (Kunsthaus)\nThe Island in the Mur (Murinsel), an artificial island in the Mur river.\nBuildings, inner courtyards (e. g.

In 2010 it was added to the existing World Heritage site of the historic centre of Graz.\nThe Mariatrost Basilica (Basilika Mariatrost) a late Baroque church, on the eastern edge of Graz.\nThe Jesus's Heart Church (Herz-Jesu-Kirche) is the largest church in Graz with the third highest spire in Austria, built in Gothic Revival style.\nThe Calvary Hill (Kalvarienberg) in the G\u00f6sting area of Graz with a 17th-century calvary and church.\nThe Graz University Hospital is the largest hospital in Graz and one of the largest hospitals in Austria. It's the largest Jugendstil building complex in Austria and was built between 1904 and 1912. It's run by the province Styria and is one of the most renowned hospitals in Austria and Central Europe.\nBest viewpoints for vistas of the city are the G\u00f6sting Ruin (Ruine G\u00f6sting), a ruin of a hilltop castle on the city's northwestern edge, and Plabutsch/F\u00fcrstenstand, behind Eggenberg Palace, with a hilltop restaurant and viewing tower.\n\n\n=== Greater Graz area ===\n\u00d6sterreichisches Freilichtmuseum St\u00fcbing, an open-air museum containing old farmhouses/farm buildings from all over Austria reassembled in historic setting.\nLurgrotte, the most extensive cave system in Austria.\nLipizzanergest\u00fct Piber, Lipizzaner stud at Piber where the famous horses are bred.\nThe Steirische Weinstra\u00dfe is a wine-growing region south of Graz, also known as the \"Styrian Tuscany\".\nThermenregion, spa region east of Graz.\nRiegersburg Castle, a mighty fortress that was never taken.

In the outer districts buildings are predominantly of the architectural styles from the second half of the 20th century.\nIn 1965 the Grazer Schule (School of Graz) was founded. Several buildings around the universities are of this style, for example the green houses by Volker Giencke and the RESOWI center by G\u00fcnther Domenig.\nBefore Graz became the European Capital of Culture in 2003, several new projects were realized, such as the Stadthalle, the Kindermuseum (museum for children), the Helmut-List-Halle, the Kunsthaus and the Murinsel.\n\nTallest buildings\nBuildings in Graz which are at least 50m tall: \n\n\n=== Sports ===\nSK Sturm Graz is the main football club of the city, with three Austrian championships and five runner-up seasons. The Grazer AK also won an Austrian championship, but went into administration in 2007 and was excluded from the professional league system.\nIn ice hockey, the ATSE Graz was the Austrian Hockey League champion in 1975 and 1978. The EC Graz was runner-up in 1991\u201392, 1992\u201393 and 1993\u201394.

It's still facing referendum, meaning usually the end for many former olympic bids in Europe and North America since 1970 -century.\n\n\n=== Styriarte ===\nGraz hosts the annual festival of classical music Styriarte, founded in 1985 to tie conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt closer to his hometown. Events have been held at different venues in Graz and in the surrounding region.\n\n\n=== Dialect ===\nReferred to as Steirisch by locals, Graz belongs to the Austro-Bavarian region of dialects, more specifically a mix of Central Bavarian in the western part of Styria and Southern Bavarian in the eastern part. The Grazer ORF, the Graz subsidiary of Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, launched an initiative in 2008 called Scho wieda Steirisch g'redt in order to highlight the numerous dialects of Graz and Styria in general and to cultivate the pride many Styrians hold for their local culture. Two reasons for a melding of these dialects with Standard German: the influence of television and radio bringing Standard German into the home and the industrialization causing the disappearance of the single farmer since the farming communities are seen as the true keepers of dialect speaking.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nAn extensive public transport network makes Graz an easy city to navigate without a car. The city has a comprehensive bus network, complementing the Graz tram network consisting of eight lines. Four lines pass through the underground tram stop at the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof) and on to the city centre before branching out. Furthermore, there are seven night-time bus routes, although these run only at weekends and on evenings preceding public holidays.\nThe Schlossbergbahn, a funicular railway, and the Schlossberg lift, a vertical lift, link the city centre to the Schlossberg.\nFrom the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), regional trains link to most of Styria. Direct trains run to most major cities nearby including Vienna, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Maribor and Ljubljana in Slovenia, Zagreb in Croatia, Budapest in Hungary, Prague and Brno in the Czech Republic, Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland, as well as Munich, Stuttgart, Heidelberg, and Frankfurt in Germany. Trains for Vienna leave every hour. In recent years many railway stations within the city limits and in the suburbs have been rebuilt or modernised and are now part of the \"S-Bahn Graz\", a commuter train service connecting the city with its suburban area and towns nearby.\nGraz airport is located about 10 km (6 mi) south of the city centre and is accessible by bus, railway, and car. Direct destinations include Amsterdam, Berlin, D\u00fcsseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart, Istanbul, Vienna and Zurich.\n\n\n== Health ==\nIn Graz there are seven hospitals, several private hospitals and sanatoriums, as well as 44 pharmacies.\nThe University Hospital Graz (LKH-Universit\u00e4ts-Klinikum Graz) is located in eastern Graz and has 1,556 beds and 7,190 employees. The Regional Hospital Graz II (LKH Graz II) has two sites in Graz. The western site (LKH Graz II Standort West) is located in Eggenberg and has 280 beds and about 500 employees, the southern site (LKH Graz II Standort S\u00fcd) specializes in neurology and psychiatry and is located in Stra\u00dfgang with 880 beds and 1,100 employees.

Perpetually two emergency doctor's cars (NEF \u2013 Notarzteinsatzfahrzeug), two NAWs (Notarztwagen \u2013 ambulances staffed with a physician in addition to regular personnel) and about 30 RTWs (Rettungswagen \u2013 regular ambulances) are on standby. Furthermore, several non-emergency ambulances (KTW \u2013 Krankentransportwagen) and a Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) are operated by the Red Cross to transport non-emergency patients to and between hospitals. In addition to the Red Cross, the Labourers'-Samaritan-Alliance (Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund \u00d6sterreichs), the Austrian organisation of the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps (Malteser Hospitaldienst Austria) and the Green Cross (Gr\u00fcnes Kreuz) operate ambulances (KTW) for non-emergency patient transport. In addition to the cars, there's also the C12 air ambulance helicopter stationed at Graz airport, staffed with an emergency physician in addition to regular personnel.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nGraz is twinned with:\n\nOther forms of cooperation and city friendship similar to the twin city programmes\n Ni\u0161, Serbia\n Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nThe following are past and present notable residents of Graz.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Austria portal\nList of World Heritage Sites in Austria\nKastner & \u00d6hler\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"Graz: Stadtplanung und Stadtentwicklung (Rechnungshofbericht, 2006) in German\" (PDF). 2006.

          "It's cliche, but don't say you were on Graz if you missed the Kunsthaus. Ride around at least. Or see it from the Schlossberg. It's modern architecture in the old town. I like it a lot.",

Customarily located in a tower, it is played from a clavier, or keyboard, containing wooden levers and pedals wired to clappers or, less commonly, from an ivory keyboard with electric action operating the clappers; but only the first method permits expression through variation of touch. On some instruments a part of the range is capable of automatic play by use of perforated rolls.carillonCarillon in the Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul, St. Petersburg.RuED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBritannica Quiz\nWhat\u2019s in a Name: Music Edition\nWhich of these artists was nicknamed \"King of Mambo\"?\n\n\n\nMost carillons encompass three to four octaves, a few five and even six. Although the bourdon, or lowest note, can be any pitch, it often sounds around middle C. In heavy instruments the bell to produce this note may weigh 6 to 8 tons, occasionally 10 or 12; the world\u2019s heaviest, at the Riverside Church, New York City, weighs 20 tons. Carillon bells diminish in size and weight with the upward scale to extreme trebles of about 20 pounds (9 kilograms). Playing large instruments\u2014using fists and feet\u2014takes considerable physical exertion, as clappers weighing as much as several hundred pounds must be swung. (The heaviest clappers are counterbalanced.)Most carillon music has been arranged for a specific instrument by its player. Baroque music of the 17th and 18th centuries adapts to bells; much of Vivaldi, Couperin, Corelli, Handel, Bach, and Mozart is admirably suited to carillon transcription. Nineteenth-century Romantic music must be chosen selectively, and contemporary music even more so. Improvisation is extensively employed, particularly on folk songs and other familiar themes.The word carillon was originally applied in France to four stationary clock bells (hence the medieval Latin name quadrilionem) and later referred to any group of fixed bells. During the 14th century a weight-driven revolving pegged drum was invented that could be connected to clockworks; the pegs tripped levers wired to hammers, which in turn struck the bells. For the next 150 years, clock chimes struck by this method produced simple note sequences or melodies preceding the hour strike in church and town-hall towers. Interest in the musical potential of bells was greatest in Belgium and the Netherlands, where bell founding had reached an advanced stage and a bell profile had been developed that produced a more musical sound than those of foreign founders. The set of bells now known as a carillon originated in Flanders, possibly at Aalst or Antwerp, in about 1480. The Flemish devised a wooden keyboard for use alongside the chiming cylinder. This innovation became popular throughout Belgium and the Netherlands and northern France but was widely adopted elsewhere only in modern times.\r\nGet exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription. \r\nSubscribe today\nCarillon art reached a pinnacle in the latter half of the 17th century with the founders Fran\u00e7ois and Pierre H\u00e9mony of the Netherlands. They were the first to tune the bells with precision, especially with regard to a bell\u2019s inner tuning (i.e., of the partial tones that make up a bell\u2019s complex sound), and thus to put fully into practice the results of research completed 200 years earlier. During the 19th century, tuning techniques (but not the underlying theory) were forgotten as orders for bells slackened; the bells that were made were generally inferior, and carillons fell into disrepair. The rediscovery of the tuning process at the John Taylor and Company foundry in Loughborough, Leicestershire, England, in the 1890s initiated a revival of carillon art.Mechelen, Belgium, has been the focal point of the carillon since the 16th century, the first post of municipal carillonneur being established there in 1557, at St. Rombold\u2019s Cathedral. Its carillon remains the world\u2019s best known. Jef Denyn, who played there from 1881 to 1941, led in the restoration of the art, establishing in 1922 the first carillon school and a publishing enterprise. In the same year, the carillon was introduced to the United States, where later the world\u2019s two largest, each with 72 bells, were built for the Riverside Church in New York City and for Rockefeller Chapel at the University of Chicago.

        "wiki": "Graz ( GRAHTS, German: [\u0261\u0281a\u02d0ts] (listen); Slovene: Gradec) is the capital city of Styria and Austria's second-largest city after Vienna. As of 1 January 2019, Graz had a population of 328,276 (292,269 of whom had principal-residence status). In 2015, the population of the Graz larger urban zone (LUZ) stood at 633,168, based on principal-residence status. Graz has a long tradition as a seat of higher education. It has four colleges and four universities with more than 60,000 students. Its historic centre  (Altstadt) is one of the best-preserved city centres in Central Europe.For centuries, Graz was more important to Slovenes and Croats, both politically and culturally, than the capitals of Ljubljana, Slovenia and Zagreb, Croatia; it remains influential to this day. In 1999, the city's historic centre was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites and in 2010 the designation was expanded to include Eggenberg Palace (German: Schloss Eggenberg) on the western edge of the city. Graz was designated the Cultural Capital of Europe in 2003 and became a City of Culinary Delights in 2008.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name of the city, Graz, formerly spelled Gratz, most likely stems from the Slavic gradec, which means \"small castle\". Some archaeological finds point to the erection of a small castle by Alpine Slavic people, which over time became a heavily defended fortification. In literary Slovene and Croatian, gradec still means \"small castle\", forming a hypocoristic derivative of Proto-West-South Slavic *grad\u044cc\u044a, whichs descends via liquid metathesis from Common Slavic *gard\u044cc\u044a and via the Slavic third palatalisation from Proto-Slavic *gardiku, originally denoting \"small town, settlement\". The name thus follows the common South Slavic pattern for naming settlements as grad. The German name 'Graz' first appears in records in 1128.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGraz is situated on both sides of the Mur river in southeast Austria. It is about 200 km (120 mi) southwest of Vienna (Wien). The nearest larger urban centre is Maribor (Marburg) in Slovenia, which is about 50 km (31 mi) to the south. Graz is the state capital and largest city in Styria, a green and heavily forested region on the eastern edge of the Alps.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring municipalities ===\nThese towns and villages border Graz:\n\nto the north: Gratkorn, Stattegg, Weinitzen\nto the east: Kainbach bei Graz, Hart bei Graz, Raaba\nto the south: G\u00f6ssendorf, Feldkirchen bei Graz, Seiersberg\nto the west: Attendorf, Thal, Judendorf-Stra\u00dfengel\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nGraz is divided into 17 municipal districts (Stadtbezirke):\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement on the ground of the modern city of Graz dates back to the Copper Age. However, no historical continuity exists of a settlement before the Middle Ages.\nDuring the 12th century, dukes under Babenberg rule made the town into an important commercial center. Later, Graz came under the rule of the Habsburgs and, in 1281, gained special privileges from King Rudolph I.\nIn the 14th century, Graz became the city of residence of the Inner Austrian line of the Habsburgs. The royalty lived in the Schlossberg castle and from there ruled Styria, Carinthia, most of today's Slovenia, and parts of Italy (Carniola, Gorizia and Gradisca, Trieste).\nIn the 16th century, the city's design and planning were primarily controlled by Italian Renaissance architects and artists. One of the most famous buildings representative of this style is the Landhaus, designed by Domenico dell'Allio, and used by the local rulers as a governmental headquarters.\n\nThe University of Graz was founded by Archduke Karl II in 1585, it's the city's oldest university. For most of its existence, it was controlled by the Catholic church, and was closed in 1782 by Joseph II in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a lyceum where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-established as a university by Emperor Franz I, and was named 'Karl-Franzens Universit\u00e4t' or 'Charles-Francis University' in English. More than 30,000 students are currently enrolled at this university.\nThe astronomer Johannes Kepler lived in Graz for a short period. He worked as a math teacher and was a professor of mathematics at the University of Graz, but still found time to study astronomy. He left Graz for Prague when Lutherans were banned from the city.\nLudwig Boltzmann was Professor for Mathematical Physics from 1869 to 1890. During that time, Nikola Tesla studied electrical engineering at the Polytechnic in 1875. Nobel Laureate Otto Loewi taught at the University of Graz from 1909 until 1938. Ivo Andric, the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature Laureate obtained his doctorate at the University of Graz. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger was briefly chancellor of the University of Graz in 1936.\nGraz is centrally located within today's Bundesland (state) of Styria, or Steiermark in German. Mark is an old German word indicating a large area of land used as a defensive border, in which the peasantry is taught how to organize and fight in the case of an invasion. With a strategic location at the head of the open and fertile Mur valley, Graz was historically a target of invaders, such as the Hungarians under Matthias Corvinus in 1481, and the Ottoman Turks in 1529 and 1532. Apart from the Riegersburg Castle, the Schlossberg was the only fortification in the region that never fell to the Ottoman Turks. Graz is home to the region's provincial armory, which is the world's largest historical collection of late medieval and Renaissance weaponry. It has been preserved since 1551, and displays over 30,000 items.\nFrom the earlier part of the 15th century, Graz was the residence of the younger branch of the Habsburgs, which succeeded to the imperial throne in 1619 in the person of Emperor Ferdinand II, who moved the capital to Vienna. New fortifications were built on the Schlossberg at the end of the 16th century. Napoleon's army occupied Graz in 1797. In 1809, the city withstood another assault by the French army. During this attack, the commanding officer in the fortress was ordered to defend it with about 900 men against Napoleon's army of about 3,000. He successfully defended the Schlossberg against eight attacks, but they were forced to give up after the Grande Arm\u00e9e occupied Vienna and the Emperor ordered to surrender. Following the defeat of Austria by Napoleonic forces at the Battle of Wagram in 1809, the fortifications were demolished using explosives, as stipulated in the Peace of Sch\u00f6nbrunn of the same year. The belltower (Glockenturm) and the civic clock tower (Uhrturm), which is a leading tourist attraction and serves as a symbol for Graz, were spared after the citizens of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation.Archduke Karl II of Inner Austria had 20,000 Protestant books burned in the square of what is now a mental hospital, and succeeded in returning Styria to the authority of the Holy See. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was born in Graz in what is now the Stadtmuseum (city museum).\n\n\n== Population development ==\nThe more recent population figures do not give the whole picture as only people with principal-residence status are counted and people with secondary residence status are not. Most of the people with secondary residence status in Graz are students. At the end of 2016 there were 33,473 people with secondary residence status in Graz.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nOceanic climate is the type found in the city, but due to the 0 \u00b0C isotherm, the same occurs in a humid continental climate with based in K\u00f6ppen system (Cfb/Dfb borderline). Wladimir K\u00f6ppen himself was in town and conducted studies to see how the climate of the past influenced the Continental Drift theory. Due to its position southeast of the Alps, Graz is shielded from the prevailing westerly winds that bring weather fronts in from the North Atlantic to northwestern and central Europe. The weather in Graz is thus influenced by the Mediterranean, and it has more hours of sunshine per year than Vienna or Salzburg and also less wind or rain. Graz lies in a basin that is only open to the south, causing the climate to be warmer than would be expected at that latitude. Plants are found in Graz that normally grow much further south.\n\naverage temperatures: Graz Airport 8.7 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) / Karl-Franzens University 9.4 \u00b0C (49 \u00b0F)\naverage rainfall: 818 mm (32 in) with on average 92 days of rain (Karl Franzens University)\naverage hours of sunshine: 1,989 (Karl Franzens University)\n\n\n== Slovenes and Graz ==\nPolitically, culturally, scientifically and religiously, Graz was an important centre for all Slovenes, especially from the establishment of the University of Graz in 1586 until the establishment of University of Ljubljana in 1919. In 1574, the first Slovene Catholic book was published in Graz, and in 1592, Hieronymus Megiser published in Graz the book Dictionarium quatuor linguarum, the first multilingual dictionary of Slovene.The Styrian Slovenes did not consider Graz a German-speaking city, but their own, a place to study while living at their relatives' homes and to fulfill one's career ambitions. The student associations in Graz were a crucible of the Slovene identity, and the Slovene students in Graz were more nationally aware than some others. This led to fierce anti-Slovene efforts of German-speaking nationalists in Graz before and during World War II.Many Slovenian Styrians study there. Slovenes are among the professors at the Institute for Jazz in Graz. Numerous Slovenes have found employment there, while being formerly unemployed in Slovenia. For the Slovene culture, Graz remains permanently important due to its university and the Universalmuseum Joanneum archives containing numerous documents from the Slovenian Styria.A symposium on the relation of Graz and the Slovenes was held in Graz in 2010, at the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the first and oldest chair of Slovene. It was established at the Lyzeum of Graz in July 1811 on the initiative of Janez Nepomuk Primic. A collection of lectures on the topic was published. The Slovenian Post commemorated the anniversary with a stamp.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nFor the year that Graz was Cultural Capital of Europe, new structures were erected. The Graz Museum of Contemporary Art (German: Kunsthaus) was designed by Peter Cook and Colin Fournier and is situated next to the Mur river. The Island in the Mur is a floating platform made of steel. It was designed by American architect Vito Acconci and contains a caf\u00e9, an open-air theatre and a playground.\n\n\n=== Historic city centre ===\n\nThe historic centre was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999 due to the harmonious co-existence of typical buildings from different epochs and in different architectural styles. Situated in a cultural borderland between Central Europe, Italy and the Balkan States, Graz absorbed various influences from the neighbouring regions and thus received its exceptional townscape. Today the historic centre consists of over 1,000 buildings, their age ranging from Gothic to contemporary.\nThe most important sights in the historic centre are:\n\nTown Hall (Rathaus).\nThe Castle hill (German: Schlossberg), a hill dominating the historic centre (475 m (1,558.40 ft) high), site of a demolished fortress, with views over Graz.\nThe Clock Tower (Uhrturm) is a symbol of Graz, at the top of the Castle hill.\nThe New Gallery (Neue Galerie), a museum of art.\nThe Castle hill funicular (Schlossbergbahn), a funicular railway on the Castle hill's slope.\nThe seat of Styria's provincial parliament (Landhaus), a palace in Lombardic style. It is one of the most important examples of Renaissance architecture in Austria and was built by Italian architect Domenico dell'Allio between 1557 and 1565.\nThe Armoury (Landeszeughaus) is the largest of its kind in the world.\nThe Graz Opera House (Opernhaus), the principal venue for opera, ballet, and operetta performances. It is the 2nd largest opera house in Austria.\nThe Graz Theatre (Schauspielhaus), Graz's principal theatre for productions of plays.\nThe Cathedral (Dom), a rare monument of Gothic architecture. Once, there were many frescos on the outer walls; today, only a few remain, like the Landplagenbild (\"picture of plagues\") painted in 1485, presumably by Thomas von Villach. The three plagues it depicts are locusts, pestilence and the invasion of the Turks, all of them striking the town in 1480. It features the oldest painted view of Graz.\nThe mausoleum of Emperor Ferdinand II next to the cathedral, the most important building of Mannerism in Graz. It includes both the grave where Ferdinand II and his wife are buried, and a church dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria.\nThe Castle (Burg), with Gothic double staircase, built between 1438 and 1453 by Emperor Frederick III, because the old castle on the Schlossberg hill was too small and uncomfortable. The castle remained the residence of the Inner Austrian Court until 1619. Today, it serves as residence for the Styrian government.\nThe Painted House (Gemaltes Haus) in Herrengasse 3. It is completely covered with frescos (painted in 1742 by Johann Mayer).\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art Graz (Kunsthaus)\nThe Island in the Mur (Murinsel), an artificial island in the Mur river.\nBuildings, inner courtyards (e. g.

In 2010 it was added to the existing World Heritage site of the historic centre of Graz.\nThe Mariatrost Basilica (Basilika Mariatrost) a late Baroque church, on the eastern edge of Graz.\nThe Jesus's Heart Church (Herz-Jesu-Kirche) is the largest church in Graz with the third highest spire in Austria, built in Gothic Revival style.\nThe Calvary Hill (Kalvarienberg) in the G\u00f6sting area of Graz with a 17th-century calvary and church.\nThe Graz University Hospital is the largest hospital in Graz and one of the largest hospitals in Austria. It's the largest Jugendstil building complex in Austria and was built between 1904 and 1912. It's run by the province Styria and is one of the most renowned hospitals in Austria and Central Europe.\nBest viewpoints for vistas of the city are the G\u00f6sting Ruin (Ruine G\u00f6sting), a ruin of a hilltop castle on the city's northwestern edge, and Plabutsch/F\u00fcrstenstand, behind Eggenberg Palace, with a hilltop restaurant and viewing tower.\n\n\n=== Greater Graz area ===\n\u00d6sterreichisches Freilichtmuseum St\u00fcbing, an open-air museum containing old farmhouses/farm buildings from all over Austria reassembled in historic setting.\nLurgrotte, the most extensive cave system in Austria.\nLipizzanergest\u00fct Piber, Lipizzaner stud at Piber where the famous horses are bred.\nThe Steirische Weinstra\u00dfe is a wine-growing region south of Graz, also known as the \"Styrian Tuscany\".\nThermenregion, spa region east of Graz.\nRiegersburg Castle, a mighty fortress that was never taken.

In the outer districts buildings are predominantly of the architectural styles from the second half of the 20th century.\nIn 1965 the Grazer Schule (School of Graz) was founded. Several buildings around the universities are of this style, for example the green houses by Volker Giencke and the RESOWI center by G\u00fcnther Domenig.\nBefore Graz became the European Capital of Culture in 2003, several new projects were realized, such as the Stadthalle, the Kindermuseum (museum for children), the Helmut-List-Halle, the Kunsthaus and the Murinsel.\n\nTallest buildings\nBuildings in Graz which are at least 50m tall: \n\n\n=== Sports ===\nSK Sturm Graz is the main football club of the city, with three Austrian championships and five runner-up seasons. The Grazer AK also won an Austrian championship, but went into administration in 2007 and was excluded from the professional league system.\nIn ice hockey, the ATSE Graz was the Austrian Hockey League champion in 1975 and 1978. The EC Graz was runner-up in 1991\u201392, 1992\u201393 and 1993\u201394.

It's still facing referendum, meaning usually the end for many former olympic bids in Europe and North America since 1970 -century.\n\n\n=== Styriarte ===\nGraz hosts the annual festival of classical music Styriarte, founded in 1985 to tie conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt closer to his hometown. Events have been held at different venues in Graz and in the surrounding region.\n\n\n=== Dialect ===\nReferred to as Steirisch by locals, Graz belongs to the Austro-Bavarian region of dialects, more specifically a mix of Central Bavarian in the western part of Styria and Southern Bavarian in the eastern part. The Grazer ORF, the Graz subsidiary of Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, launched an initiative in 2008 called Scho wieda Steirisch g'redt in order to highlight the numerous dialects of Graz and Styria in general and to cultivate the pride many Styrians hold for their local culture. Two reasons for a melding of these dialects with Standard German: the influence of television and radio bringing Standard German into the home and the industrialization causing the disappearance of the single farmer since the farming communities are seen as the true keepers of dialect speaking.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nAn extensive public transport network makes Graz an easy city to navigate without a car. The city has a comprehensive bus network, complementing the Graz tram network consisting of eight lines. Four lines pass through the underground tram stop at the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof) and on to the city centre before branching out. Furthermore, there are seven night-time bus routes, although these run only at weekends and on evenings preceding public holidays.\nThe Schlossbergbahn, a funicular railway, and the Schlossberg lift, a vertical lift, link the city centre to the Schlossberg.\nFrom the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), regional trains link to most of Styria. Direct trains run to most major cities nearby including Vienna, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Maribor and Ljubljana in Slovenia, Zagreb in Croatia, Budapest in Hungary, Prague and Brno in the Czech Republic, Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland, as well as Munich, Stuttgart, Heidelberg, and Frankfurt in Germany. Trains for Vienna leave every hour. In recent years many railway stations within the city limits and in the suburbs have been rebuilt or modernised and are now part of the \"S-Bahn Graz\", a commuter train service connecting the city with its suburban area and towns nearby.\nGraz airport is located about 10 km (6 mi) south of the city centre and is accessible by bus, railway, and car. Direct destinations include Amsterdam, Berlin, D\u00fcsseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart, Istanbul, Vienna and Zurich.\n\n\n== Health ==\nIn Graz there are seven hospitals, several private hospitals and sanatoriums, as well as 44 pharmacies.\nThe University Hospital Graz (LKH-Universit\u00e4ts-Klinikum Graz) is located in eastern Graz and has 1,556 beds and 7,190 employees. The Regional Hospital Graz II (LKH Graz II) has two sites in Graz. The western site (LKH Graz II Standort West) is located in Eggenberg and has 280 beds and about 500 employees, the southern site (LKH Graz II Standort S\u00fcd) specializes in neurology and psychiatry and is located in Stra\u00dfgang with 880 beds and 1,100 employees.

Perpetually two emergency doctor's cars (NEF \u2013 Notarzteinsatzfahrzeug), two NAWs (Notarztwagen \u2013 ambulances staffed with a physician in addition to regular personnel) and about 30 RTWs (Rettungswagen \u2013 regular ambulances) are on standby. Furthermore, several non-emergency ambulances (KTW \u2013 Krankentransportwagen) and a Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) are operated by the Red Cross to transport non-emergency patients to and between hospitals. In addition to the Red Cross, the Labourers'-Samaritan-Alliance (Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund \u00d6sterreichs), the Austrian organisation of the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps (Malteser Hospitaldienst Austria) and the Green Cross (Gr\u00fcnes Kreuz) operate ambulances (KTW) for non-emergency patient transport. In addition to the cars, there's also the C12 air ambulance helicopter stationed at Graz airport, staffed with an emergency physician in addition to regular personnel.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nGraz is twinned with:\n\nOther forms of cooperation and city friendship similar to the twin city programmes\n Ni\u0161, Serbia\n Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nThe following are past and present notable residents of Graz.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Austria portal\nList of World Heritage Sites in Austria\nKastner & \u00d6hler\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"Graz: Stadtplanung und Stadtentwicklung (Rechnungshofbericht, 2006) in German\" (PDF). 2006.

          "Hard to find but worth the visit. Its just lovely. It's old & quaint with lots of charm and character. Nice to wander. A stream for the dog to have a dip, an excellent hotel & golf course and a couple of good pubs - whats not to like.",

          "Stopped here on our way from London to Cornwall to break up the journey. There is a free visitor's car park within a few minutes walk from the village (use postcode SN14 7HU for Dunns Lane car park). The village is fairly quiet (apart from tourists!) and there are several",
          "Lovely village, great pub that serves great food at great prices and very friendly staff. We had an evening meal and that was awesome",
          "This is one of the prettiest and most unspoilt villages in England. Take time to wander through the village and just enjoy the the ambience - if you can ignore the sometimes large crowds. No wonder this village has been used in films. Pictures will not do it justice - just",
          "We had the most marvellous and relaxing Bank Holiday long weekend. We were pampered from the moment we arrived until we left. Nothing was too much for the staff. Our breakfast was a wonderful choice of cold or hot foods. The atmosphere in the dining room was relaxed as for once",
          "Must be one of the prettiest places in the UK. Sadly always crowded but as we stayed locally we got to see it before everyone arrived at breakfast time. Well worth a detour. The church is very special.",
          "It was an interesting place to visit to round up our Cotswolds trip. Such a quiet and quaint place, with peaceful ambience. Taking a stroll through the single road that is the village will give you a glimpse of simpler times.",
          "Beautiful village in the Cotswolds. Really feels like a true Victorian village. Parking at the top of a hill keeps the village a lot more traditional - some cars but very few. Slightly spoilt by the tourists - please don\u2019t swim in the river! Or mess about in front of people\u2019s",
          "Picturesque village, worth an hour of any tourist's time, recommend parking in the car park about 10 minutes walk away from the village centre, lots of photo opportunities of where time has apparently stood still.",
          "First visit into village I am staying near, walked in with the dog. This is got to be the one of the most beautiful villages, amazing old properties, peaceful and true to its history. Managed to find a walk from the village on a loop which was perfect for the dog, but there",
          "A wonderful surprise visit. There is a guide that walks with you giving information and little tipbits about interesting facts about the Village. At the end of the visit there is the possibilty of experincing a real english hightea at the home of the guide this i understand is",
          "I start by saying I didn\u2019t drive here; I wouldn\u2019t do well on those very narrow country roads with national speed limit (!!!). I took a cab from Cippenham station (\u00a315, 15 minutes roughly), so I didn\u2019t have to worry about parking or getting a fine and could just enjoy my walk",
          "Free parking at the top of the village, then a medium stroll down to this beautiful photogenic gem. Cafes and hotels serving food, with a cute \u2018honesty box\u2019 cake stall outside one of the houses. Public toilets over the bridge. Don\u2019t forget it\u2019s uphill all the way back to the car",
          "Absolutely breathtaking! We parked our car castle Combe free visitor car park and we walked down 10 minutes to the village. Walking was very very beautiful , but if you don\u2019t want to walk keep going down the village. And then turn left and keep walking you will see the best view",
          "We parked up the top of the hill in the free car park and walkeed down without appreciating that it was a bit steep. Many people managed to park their car closer to the village but actually it was a nice day and not to hot so did not mind walking. The village itself is very",
          "Beautiful village and a dream for photographers! I was blown away by its beauty. We came early in the morning around 10 am, and it was perfect. Not to many people out and about at that time and you can enjoy the peace and quiet and of course, get lovely photos :) If you have the",
          "Very picturesque. Also Manor House Hotel is lovely. Parking can be issue though. Decent pubs & food.",
          "Beautiful place, we visited mid week in July. Ignored the posted carpark on the outskirts and found parking easily just beyond the beautiful bridge. It seemed to be off the coach itinerary- at least most of them!. Very beautiful, unspoilt. Fairly easy to get photos without",
          "It really has to be seen to be believed. It\u2019s so many things Stepping back in time Very Disney like - almost as if the Disney films have been modelled in castle Combe. You can definitely see why it\u2019s been named the prettiest village in England.",
          "You can see why this village is the setting of many movies including Warhorse. It\u2019s a time capsule and very wonderful. Quintessentially old English. There is a pub, an ice cream house and a cake shop. Worth exploring the church too.",
          "The village is quiet, relaxing, worth to have a walk. One of the nicest Costwolds village. Thanks God without tourist buses, at least in the afternoon. I missed to have more time for sorting in a terrace to gets drink",

          "A really lovely village. Great pub lunch (ploughman\u2019s) with good sized portions. Good photo opportunities",
          "Definitely worth stopping to spend a while exploring the village, the church, and relaxing on a bench watching the stream.",
          "Very pretty and great that it doesn't have horrible tourist shops. Had a great meal in the Castle Inn.",
          "Being an American this village was everything I always imagined an English village would look like. The homes were tiny and old and charming. There was a creek flowing through the village. There was an old, old church. The streets were small and twisting. I loved it! We walked",
          "This was a dream for my wife to visit this charming classic Cotswold village. The town is small with few services so this is not a place to expect lots of options. There are a couple of restaurants but this is more a visual feast for this the love the British traditional look.",
          "If you are arriving by car, you will find a free car park above the village and after a short walk down the hill you arrive into the charming place. The village is great to explore and there is plenty of places to eat or enjoy a nice drink. I highly recommend a visit here.",
          "Our first stop on a driving tour through the Cotswolds was Castle Combe, which claims to be one of the most beautiful villages in the Cotswolds. Having now completed the tour, we would have to agree. Beautiful little village. There are public restrooms at one end. There is a car",
          "No castle but there are remains of a castle, but you won't see it. It is overgrown and on private property. BUT, you should still make a quick stop here for about 30-40 minutes. Early in the morning, we were able to park on the side of the road and walk thru the village. Be sure",
          "We went about 7:30 in the evening. The sun was still up but the crowds were gone. We parked down in the village just over the bridge near the public toilets that were still open. Lovely to wander around the village and take photos at this quieter time of day.",
          "I have toured many villages throughout the Cotswolds, and this is one of my favorites. Very small, but beautiful to walk around.",

          "Lovely village. Only issue is the parking lot is on top of a hill and is a long climb up and down. We noticed a lot of people just parking alongside the hill which is a closer walk to the village. Otherwise, it's a beautiful village and great for a photo op.",

          "Splendid little enclave, we were fortunate to stumble across just a 45 minutes out of Bath, enroute to London. This charming village is why people love the Cotswolds, time has mostly stood still in this town founded in the 11th century.",
          "A stop in this little village was a wonderful way to spend the morning. It\u2019s a quiet, quintessential English village. While there, try out The Old Rectory for tea, but be sure to call ahead for a reservation!",
          "This is a beautiful little village but not much to do. A couple of pubs and a little shop and a church. Someone had a stall outside there house, which we bought some cakes but they weren't very good. The shortbread was soggy and the chocolate cake was melted. Lovely",
          "It' s a nice destination to have good time full of history. You can walk around the village take awesome photos of beautiful Cotswold stone houses. After the tour you can enjoy a cup of a coffee on the center of the village.",

          "Although the village is pretty, it is almost like a film set. Parking is on top of the hill and the walk into the village would be a challenge to anyone with mobility issues. It is well worth visiting Castle Combe as it is one of England\u2019s prettiest villages.",
          "If you are looking for a quintessentially English unspoilt Village, then this is the place for you. It is so beautiful and well preserved, with gorgeous buildings and a pretty stream running through. Lots of places to have a drink and stop off.",

          "I'd read that the town was used in many old films such as war horse. Very much enjoyed our visit. True there's isn't much to do, but enjoy the scenery and perhaps have lunch. You must have a wander into the he lovely church. It has a photograph exhibition, showing scenes from",

          "We were not dis appointed in visiting the village. It was beautifull and we could see why it has been chosen for several films. The church is very well maintained and has the very old faceless clock in it. We were there when 12 oclock was struck. Fascinating,!",
          "Beautiful village that looks like it should be in a fairy tale. It is a village where people still live. There is a little shop that sells refreshments and a tiny market. The church has services on Sundays that anyone can attend. The day we went it was raining but still very",
          "Lovely spot! Glad we popped in. Just avoid the White Hart pub. I said more about this in the review for the place but we were made to feel very unwelcome. But this town is super quaint.",
          "The village certainly is quaint & beautiful, but I agree with others that there's not a whole lot to do. If you aren't combining it with a meal stop, then it will take you less than 30 minutes to walk from one end to the other. It's basically a quick photo opportunity, & I",
          "A really lovely picturesque quaint old village. A village that time forgot. Lovely to wander around and take it all in. Parking is (quite rightly) limited in the village with a sign up stating cars will be towed away. There are a few parking spaces at the side of the road on the",
          "Quite picturesque village. Pretty streets, old houses. Fairly tale look. It is a good place to spend few hours. Pay attention to small details of houses and their outside decorations. Friendly people. Please respect the tranquility of village. Park at the top of hill Dunns lane",
          "This must be one of the prettiest villages in the country. It is very small and full of lovely old stone buildings. There is little or no parking in the village, (which is good for the preservation of it's appearance), but there is a large car park outside the village at the top",
          "If you haven\u2019t been before, you must go! This is a beautiful place to wander round and take pics. The parking is ok but can be challenging when busy. The hill is steep but walkable.",
          "Pleasant to have a quick stroll in, however expect after 5 minutes of walking to run out of things to do. The walk from the car park I think took longer.",
          "Castle Combe is a picturesque village in the Cotswolds where a number of movies have been filmed, included Doctor Doolittle and more recently, War Horse. It's totally untouched by modernity and so easy to feel that you've gone back in time as you explore the small streets down",
          "Magical is the only word for Castle Combe...historic, delightful, and architecturally fascinating also come to mind. I loved the pubs, the inns, rambling around the outskirts of the town, looking in the small shop windows, and sitting outside a caf\u00e9 for lunch in the sunshine",
          "The prettiest village I\u2019ve visited in the UK and therefore the world. It\u2019s perfect. And I found out they filmed one of my favourite films \u2018stardust\u2019 there, which really tips it over the edge.",
          "Often photographed by those with more skill than me, this picturesque village is quite the stunning beauty from a bygone era. The cottages that line the main street of town are well kept and look like they are straight out of a fairy tale story. A small stream runs by the town",
          "We did a 3 day self guided tour through the Cotswalds, and this was the last, and in my opinion, most picturesque village we stopped in. The fact that there is almost no parking available made it better. We parked in the upper lot and did the 10 minute walk down to town. Not",

          "I visited Castle Combe after reading The Burning. A book by Devin Asante. It was our first trip to England and the village is about 2 hours from London but worth the trip. The village is just as described in the book. Very charming, enchanting and historic. One of the beautiful",

          "We spent a few hours walking around and enjoying this visually beautiful English village. Where ever you looked it was truly gorgeous. We went mid week and didn\u2019t find it overly crowded. Highly recommend with a good camera!",
          "Absolutely beautiful village on the wife's advice decided to visit wasn't aware War Horse was filmed there till we arrived it has obviously become a bit of a tourist trap the traffic leading out of village was laughable sadly found the staff in white hart to be very rude but",
          "We liked Castle combe. It is a very small village, just a street or two, but packed with tourist, us included. You can walk down the street, over the bridge, bear left, then you are walking in the fields with goats and donkeys. As you would expect, not the cheapest place to grab",
          "Visited the village whilst on a break to the Cotswolds, what a beautiful little place! Just strolling through the area on a beautifully warm autumn day was perfect! It wasn\u2019t overrun with tourists due to the time of year but can imagine it to be heaving in the summer.",

          "It's jaw-droopingly gorgeous here. Don't forget to visit the knight's tomb in the little norman church. There are just two small pubs and both are good for food and as places to stay. There are 'trust shops' outside cottage doors, where you take produce and post your money",
          "Quaint village nestled in the Cotswolds. Not much economic activity but enough natural beauty to fill a day. A walk-about will bring you a greater appreciation of life in medieval GB.",

          "A must visit place in Cotswold. Beautiful town. No wonder it's the main picture of Cotswold when you Google it. The weather was nice so we thoroughly enjoyed it",
          "Stopped here on our Mad Max tour. It is a small village, but very picturesque. This is the main reason to stop here I think. The Church, stone bridge, main street, and stone gazebo, seem to be main attractions. Would have liked to visit the manor house hotel, but gate guard",
          "If you are anywhere near it\u2019s well worth the detour. Absolutely beautiful. An easy walk around and a lunch, afternoon tea or dinner at the pubs or the hotels. This is really a picture postcard place!",

          "Cosy and charming village. The Castle Inn doesn\u2019t have to do much to get hungry customers located at the square. And the menu is very ordinary with sandwiches, pies, some plates and salads. It fills your stomach, but nothing more.",
          "Visited on a weekend and it was very crowded.you need to park on top of the hill and walk down to the village.the village is small but extremely beautiful .but unfortunately spoilt by so many visitors in such a small area. Try and avoid weekends or holiday periods.",
          "Nice village to spend a short time. Arriving here by bus is difficult as there are only very few rides a day. If you travel by car...let's stop here, otherwise the travel by bus and the long stop to get back doesn't deserve the visit.",
          "This is a beautiful village but can be overrun with coachloads of visitors during the day. It is much more relaxed in the evening. There are 2 good pubs but beware thinking you will just pop into the tearoom....you must book at least 24 hours in advance. Parking at the centre",
          "This is truly the most picturesque village with quaint little houses and a stream that flows right through the middle of it. Many movies have been filmed here. You can probably walk through Castle Combe in 30 minutes and then relax a bit at one of the benches next to the river.",
          "It is a really nice village to look round, down point being the car park at the top of the hill, which would have been a breeze in my younger days, but quite tiring walking back up the hill. Also as is usually the case refreshments are quite expensive in the village, if you can",
          "Castle Combe is a beautiful little village. Just clear your mind and take a stroll around, don't forget to visit the church and also Ellen's where you can select from lots of lovely things and then pay by posting the money through the letterbox. Visit the White Hart for a meal",
          "We stayed about a day and half here in Castle Combe. Stayed in the heart of the little village in the Castle Inn. Room was so neat and clean. Actually had a bath tub and I so enjoyed the lavender toiletries available in the room. One of my favorite memories. So glad we choose to",
          "Having visited Lacock, decided to pay a quick visit to Castle Combe, dubbed 'England Prettiest Village' in the 1960's! There's a visitor car park about 5 minutes walk from the village (FREE) - they prefer you to park there and avoid the Village itself. Its a sheltered , tree",
          "This would probably have been more fun if we were staying overnight and could walk in the countryside or relax over a meal. The day was hot so walking around was a bit tiring.",
          "This is worth a visit, but you would probably only spend 10-15 minutes here. We drove all the way down and managed to get parking! I suppose it's because people dont hang around too long either. We expected it to be super crowded, but it was alright, with friendly tourists",
          "I was very surprised at just how delightfully picturesque the village of Castle Combe was. It is only small but it just so quaint. There are some very good looking pubs here also. Highly recommend you find the time to visit. After I left l learnt the movie \u2018War Horse\u2019 was filmed",
          "Absolutely heavenly on earth. Always wanted to visit and absolutely loved it!! From a bygone age. We stayed at the Castle Inn which true experience! Staying here, you also get to use the bar and amazing grounds of the Castle hotel, as they are linked. Stunning gardens!!",
          "I stumbled upon this pretty little village during a stay down the road in Acton Turville and what a pleasure it was. I parked in the free car park at the top of the village as access is limited (& rightly so!) Contrary to some reviews, the walk up & down is easy as pie & takes",
          "Castle Combe really is a picture postcard village. Beautifully preserved and so quaint.. We were thrilled to have finally visited it for ourselves. Very clean.",
          "Very pretty and unspoiled village with a very magical feel,we were there on a Monday out of the holiday season and it was reasonably quiet but I can imagine it gets packed on a weekend,one pretentious local was a bit of a drawback personally but I suppose everywhere has them.",
          "Very picturesque village and probably my favourite village in UK. This is a must visit place if you are visiting he Cotswolds or visiting near bath. Great place to walk, especially in the summer and there is a nice pub there too.",
          "This village is always an absolute delight to take our friends and visitors to. It is just so natural and kept so originnal except of course the inevitable yellow lines and signs. But winter and summer it has a magical charm. I would imagine it is a lovely community in which to",
          "Castle Combe is a very picturesque village at the bottom of a very steep hill. The village has double yellow lines everywhere so you have to park at the top of the hill in the car park or on the hill going down into the village. It is certainly worth a visit. Whether it\u2019s worth",
          "this is a must visit if you are wanting to visit cotswolds. It feels like you have stepped back in time where everything seems preserved well in the quintessentially English way. Feels like you are on a movie set or in something created by CGI. Would highly recommend.",
          "Beautiful village near Cotswolds, looks like a film set with a river running through, we were lucky as went midweek in May and there was only a handful of visitors, may be a different story at weekends and summer holidays. Well worth a visit.",
          "Picturesque village in the Cotswolds full of character and history. Often used in sets for historical and fantasy movies like \"Warhorse\", \"Stardust\", \"Wofman\" and Poirot etc. .The Manor House Hotel and connected Castle Inn are well worth a visit. Village can get crowded when",
          "We absolutely loved Castle Combe which looks like it hasn\u2019t changed much in centuries. Had a lovely pub lunch in one of the locals and enjoyed the village atmosphere. The village was saturated with tourists snapping photographs of the cottages and parking was few and far",
          "This famous 'chocolate box' village is lovely for a short visit - we arrived quite late in the afternoon when it as already crowded but managed to find one of the rare parking spots on the road into the village as a friend with me had an injury that prevented her walking from",
          "What a gorgeous little village! As you walk around it feels incredibly familiar, probably because it has featured in Period Dramas and been on many images of historic England. A lovely place with a huge amount of history. The only problem is parking. There is a large parking",
          "Pretty old village, but too crowded. Still worth a visit, speciously if you like walking. We visited this village in May. Was gorgeous, sunny day and we had amazing time walking around.",
          "We spent a pleasant couple of hours wandering up and down the street and into the church in this lovely village it is probably a little overrated in comparison to some of the other villages in the area but it certainly has a lot of charm and its links with the film industry make",
          "First of all, I don't understand the rave reviews of this village on Tripadvisor or anywhere else. The \"village\" is literally 5 houses, a church and a tiny river. There aren't any decent pubs, cafes, shops or anything except for hoardes of tourists taking 1000 pictures of the",
          "I come here so many times throughout the year...it is quite honestly one of my favourite ever places and what\u2019s even better is that\u2019s it\u2019s right on our door step, I live literally a 25 minute drive from here. So worth visiting...absolutely beautiful but very quaint. Both pubs",
          "Its like going back in time and dusk really does make it very special as the cars don't spoil the atmosphere. Well worth staying a little longer if you can, to capture this magical time.",
          "We stopped here on our way back to London from Wales on the Discover Wales tour from Rabbies. A cute English country village!",
          "My husband and I visited Castle Combe village, which was like walking into a fairy tale. You can park at the top of the hill in the car park, which is maybe a ten minute walk but it is on a hill so if you have mobility problems can be challenging heading back up hill. This",
          "I visited the South Cotswold village of Castle Combe, Chippenham, Wiltshire, England. Because it being 'local' in relation to where I live, it had been a while since I had done. Also as a 'recon' in regard taking some photos there on a later occasion. Castle Combe is a 'hidden",
          "A lot of people had parked on the road we parked in the car park. I took me 12 minutes to walk back up and I am a quick walker but the hill is very steep. When we got down into the village nowhere but the pub was open I suppose it was because it was a Sunday and not yet Tourist",
          "Worth a quick walk through. Charming to look at. The exteriors are well maintained. Streets are not littered with cars like the heart of Lacock is. The church and graveyard are worth a look. Nice stream to walk near.",
          "Castle Combe Village is a charming terraced cottage with vintage Celtic style in Wiltshire. Such a good retreat idea for any private, family or couple for fairy-tale holiday in natural farmhouse, country-house and little church heritage style. This location had been used as a",
          "Ok go once, be prepared to pay plenty and walk - it's a one way village and lots of it owned by the hotel. Beatrix Potter stuff",
          "The most fantastic and charming village with lots of small, lovely houses, nice pubs and a fairytale hotel nearby.",
          "What can you say about this village that hasn\u2019t been already said many times before it is absolutely stunning .even on an overcast day well worth visiting it if you are in the area .",
          "Beautiful little village for a wonder around. Easy access from nearby Bath. Must see when in the area.",
          "Step back into time and be mesmerised by the beauty of this little village. You can't park in village - park at either top of the hill in car park or just before you get to village area (down the hill). I would go earlier in the day to avoid the crowds.",
          "Ensure that you have a camera for lovely photos of the village and the immediate area. It has a river running through the centre and is situated at the bottom of a steep sided valley. Car parking can be difficult but with luck there is room on the road leading into the village.",
          "This lovely little village is one of my favorite places to go to when I come to the UK. I have always visited in the fall when the crowds are gone and you can stroll along and really enjoy the village. A few hours is plenty of time to visit the few shops and have a meal in one",
          "This tiny little village is story book perfect. The houses are tiny - I'm only 183cm (6ft) and I'd bump my head on the doorways - but delightful. Made of yellowish stone the village has a magical timeless appeal. You can imagine Harry Potter or some other literary figure walking",
          "The village is a stunning example of Cotswold tradition. We visited on a quiet, sunny Winter\u2019s day which is probably the best time to come. We are told that the village is inaccessible at peak season but in Winter, despite the lack of flowers and greenery it is accessible and",
          "Castle Combe is a charming little village in the Cotswolds. There is also a lovely World War I memorial on the main road near the church.",
          "Have been to the nearby racetrack several times but never heard of the village. We went with friends on return home from nearby Lacock Abbey. A lovely walk around the grounds of a local hotel and back. Will go back and see again when spring or summer arrives.",
          "A bit difficult to park when busy. Prepare to walk down a hill and back up it. Filmed war horse here. Very pretty village where you can walk along the river.",
          "Beautiful to look at for a short while. Surprised at how dead it was maybe it's a summer village. Loved the honesty cake stall. There isn't much to see or do but we did take our dog on some lovely walks",
          "Castle Coombe doesn\u2019t have a castle. It has a street of unusual cottages with stable doors, various styles of window, hanging baskets and window boxes. The Yarn Market is a feature at the top of the village, and the river with houses alongside it are stunning st the bottom.",
          "A very quaint village in a very quaint overall setting. Make sure you also visit the church and the knight's tomb.",
          "This is a great spot to wander around - a little off the beaten track means it is not over run with tourists or buses. Well worth the diversion.",
          "Personally, I think this is the prettiest of the Cotswold's villages and towns. A beautiful walk, peaceful and tranquil with beauty all around. Just park your car on the hill and go for it. Nice photo opp as well. Very special.",
          "We went to visit castle Combe and stayed at castle Combe Inn. The village is simply stunning. There is not much to do in the village as it is tiny but it is definitely worth seeing as you would struggle to find a more beautiful village anywhere. Also one of the villagers sells",
          "Beautiful village for a nice walk and a pub lunch! We had lunch at the White Heart and was very nice food.",
          "Beautiful village but very small not suitable for spending whole day there. The architecture is absolutely amazing!!! A real old English village!!",
          "This is one of my top two favorite Cotswold Villages. If only the buildings could talk; what would they say? I loved walking around the village and soaking in the atmosphere. I would imagine myself walking through old England and that the cars were horse or mule-drawn carts.",
          "Lovely quaint village which makes you feel you are in times gone by. Small cottages, a river running through and quaint pubs lovely to wander",
          "We love Castle Combe, but it is endlessly frustrating how many people choose to park on the double yellow lines and obstruct the line of sight of drivers in and out of the village. I can imagine it such a headache for local traffic, not to mention really uncourteous to the",
          "One of the most beautiful village I\u2019ve visited. The visit is as if the world was frozen in time. Rustic cottages just like the ones you\u2019ve seen in pictures. No wonder this town is one of the most photographic place in UK. We had a late lunch in town and the local residence",
          "A quiet beautiful village. Worth a stop if you\u2019re in the area. We arrived after dark in late December and it was very quiet, hardly anyone around.",
          "When you finally walk off the beaten path of the traditional tourists, you will float into the dream of the Cotswalds. Located north of Bath, this perfectly preserved estate and village is tucked away in a small valley backed by a wooded hill. Maybe your dream is a quiet game",
          "Castle Combe is a beautiful village with much charm. Many nice spots for great picture. A small village with a few eateries. Short but worth while trip.",
          "Village is quite some way off the trunk road....hence the quiet and preservation to some extent. It's like a walk back in time. Parking is a real challenge but the effort to get there is rewarding itself. Really pretty small village.",
          "Little has changed in 500 years. Walk both ways through town to see all the beautiful buildings. There is a nice church that was started in the 13th century, and upkeep paid for by local cloth merchants. Watch for the weavers cottages the two medieval Inns, thee market cross,",
          "Beautiful unspoilt village a few miles from Chippenham. The appeal is the absence of visible indicators of the last 200 years (street lighting, road signs, etc), and many honey-stoned cottages. While it is a pleasant place to stroll around for 30 minutes, the endless stream of",
          "This is a very small village and you will walk through it in five minutes. It is very picturesque but you need to stop in the village pubs to ensure your visit is extended. The New Inn was particularly good.",
          "We went here on a windy autumn morning. The car park was free, but at the top,of a steep hill. It was a pleasant walk around the village, and the church is well worth a visit, with a very interesting clock. We followed a printed village walk from the Internet, but allowed far",
          "Wow I so love this gorgeous lost in time village...so romantic. I bet the locals don't like all the visitors though!!! We were very lucky on the day we were there it was very quiet. Had a wonderful wander around and enjoyed a coffee at the local pub soaking in the view.",
          "After travelling around the UK for many years - this is the most beautiful village so far. We arrived in the morning and there wasn\u2019t another soul about. That allowed us to take some beautiful pictures of this stunning village. It was breath-taking. The cottages are picture",
          "Castle comb is such a gorgeous quaint village in the Cotswolds. You can buy cakes and drinks outside the villagers homes, just post your money through the letter box. It\u2019s totally run on trust! Picturesque river and bridge and church. Simply bliss!!",

          "It's very pretty and charming, its beautiful, but we found that there wasnt really a lot to do there, we drove 2h and a half to go to castle combe, saw it in 10min and went back to the car, it was worth it, but was expecting a bigger village maybe. It's very romantic though",
          "We heard about the town and since it was on our way to Bath we decided to stop and see it. You park in a lot about a half mile from the village, walk down to the village, and will be completely charmed by the sights. It looks like a movie village. There are quaint houses",
          "Tiny Village, beautiful Church with lots of information about when war horse was filmed there in 2012. beautiful little tea room at the old stables, pretty little stream & gorgeous houses- who could not fall in love with such a quaint place. We parked in a lay-by up the hill by",
          "Lovly quaint village. Lots of visitors. Lovly sunny afternoon in castle combe . Not much there but a walk through and a coffee was good . Shame no disabled spaces to park long way up to the car park for the wheelchair users",
          "We came here as part of a day bus tour and thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful Cotswold village. The sun had come out and it was quite nice to walk around town. The church, St. Andrews, was a beautiful and historical piece of architecture. Browsing through the many cute shops",
          "What a charming village! Lots of beautiful little stone houses and so many photographic moments ruined only by a van parked in the narrow main street.;-( It really is like going back in time! We were lucky as the place was not crowded when we visited (I can easily imagine it",
          "This is one of those small villages that must be visited. The view of the cottages by the bridge must be the most phographed ever and this is allways different thought the year. To sit and drink either coffe or a beer in the market center and just watch the world go by is a",
          "We parked at the designated car park about a 10 minute walk outside the village. We were there around 11am on a Friday and it was very quiet, we possibly could have driven and parked in the village. The walk down gives you a good opportunity to see some thatched cottages on the",

          "We arrived at Castle Combe and parked in the specified tourist car park at the top of the hill. From there, a short(-ish) walk of 10 minutes takes you down to the village. The village itself is beautiful and quaint! There are two pubs (one expensive, the other with a very basic",
          "This is a delightful small village and so old England. It was used for the setting of Steven Spielberg's \"Warhorse\" WW1 village scenes, as there are no new buildings just natural Cotswolds stone. The village is quite small and only takes a few moments to walk through, but it",
          "The is a small pretty village. Parking is several hundred metres outside the village so requires a walk down and return up the hill: a bit tough for some. The village has a small tea shop and a couple of nice pubs where one can obtain good food. Photo opportunities abound.",

          "Parking is in a large car park a fair walk away from the village, down hill on the way to the village and you know what on the way back. Small, pretty village - doesn't take long to wonder around and there was a wedding the day we were there with horse and carriage - it all",
          "Castle Combe is a tiny village full of wonderful sites. It is really quite little so you can see it within an hour. It is about 20 min drive from Bath. It can become busy with tourists at certain times of the day, so try to go there in the morning when you can have the village",

          "I'd read that this is one of the prettiest places in the uk and it lives up to this! To preserve its beauty, visitors are encouraged to park at the car park but a warning....it's some way from the village centre and the downhill trip means you'll be facing quite an uphill climb",

          "Idyllic village well worth a visit. It was so perfect and untouched that it looks unreal. It is very easy to tour quickly. We enjoyed staying in the town to have the experience to see it without many tourists. It did not disappoint.",
          "Situated well for a church and 2 pubs in the village but no other facilities there. Picturesque English Village they filmed War House here",
          "We spent half a day there today and what a delightfull Cotswold village it is .Like stepping back in time to an era long ago . You need to park up the hill in the designated car park and walk down into the village as you would be very lucky to get a park in the village, a good",

          "Just charming throughout. Unspoiled village of Cotswold stone buildings. Pretty and delightful. The excellent Manor House Hotel and Michelin star Bybrook restaurant are separately reviewed here.",
          "We went at the end of the day when it was quiet. It was lovely and peaceful, and worth a trip to see the church and the town. Great stop for movie buffs, since this is where they filmed the original Dr Doolitle and more recently, The War Horse.",
          "This is a lovely place to visit for an hour or two, there is no doubting its visual uniqueness. As such a unique place and the fact that War Horse the film was shot there, it does mean it was very busy when we visited.",
          "On our way from Bath to Loughborough we stopped by this picturesque town. I had heard about it from a friend and I am so glad we took the detour off the main road. Not only is it beautiful the richness of the history is amazing. A walk through the church garden and cemetery were",
          "A really beautiful village to spend a few hours in. It's very small and there isn't much to do other than eat and drink, but with The Old Rectory Tearooms here, that's an absolute pleasure. I recommend reading the 'Things to see' page on the Castle Combe website beforehand",
          "Castle Combe Village is a wonderful small town in the southern part of the Cotswolds, making it easy to get to as a side trip to Bath or on your way to Cardiff. First of all, be sure that your sat-nav (GPS) is set to Castle Combe Village, and not to the Castle Combe Circuit,",
          "We had a delightful afternoon of scones with jam, clotted cream and tea. The scones were light and fluffy and the room was gorgeous. Anna made us feel very welcome. The village and tea room are definitely a \"must do\" if you are in the Cotswolds.",
          "This is a much quieter little village than most in the Cotswolds, due to lack of shopping and limited parking. This is good, as it keeps those unprepared to take a little exercise from the excellent free parking to the village away. Whilst there is not much to do other than take",
          "After our dinner at the nearby Salutation Inn,my curiosity got the better of me as i wondered how this beautiful village would look on a dark evening......so we drove down into the centre and managed to park with ease,as many took photos of our countries finest.One thing i",

          "What a beautiful unspoilt little village. We visited late on a Saturday afternoon and managed to park down the hill just near the village. If you use the public car park it is a long hike back up the hill. Very picturesque and a great photo opportunity. The village nestles in a",

          "I only visited a few villages in the Cotswolds over my 2 days but Castle Combe was my favourite, as I thought it was the most quaint, picturesque and prettiest. It was very small, and can be explored in only a few hours, as there are not many shops and only a few places to eat.",

          "There is a free car park but it is at the top of a long fairly steep hill that leads to this beautiful village. It is well worth the treck but the hike back up the hill is a killer. Some people park on the hill but we did see that if they went a little over the yellow lines,",

          "I had read that this is a well preserved village with little changes in the last few centuries, so I was intrigued. Unfortuneately, we arrived in the pouring rain and as we were staying at one of the two pubs, we could drive down the hill and offload our bags. Most cars and",

        "wiki": "Graz ( GRAHTS, German: [\u0261\u0281a\u02d0ts] (listen); Slovene: Gradec) is the capital city of Styria and Austria's second-largest city after Vienna. As of 1 January 2019, Graz had a population of 328,276 (292,269 of whom had principal-residence status). In 2015, the population of the Graz larger urban zone (LUZ) stood at 633,168, based on principal-residence status. Graz has a long tradition as a seat of higher education. It has four colleges and four universities with more than 60,000 students. Its historic centre  (Altstadt) is one of the best-preserved city centres in Central Europe.For centuries, Graz was more important to Slovenes and Croats, both politically and culturally, than the capitals of Ljubljana, Slovenia and Zagreb, Croatia; it remains influential to this day. In 1999, the city's historic centre was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites and in 2010 the designation was expanded to include Eggenberg Palace (German: Schloss Eggenberg) on the western edge of the city. Graz was designated the Cultural Capital of Europe in 2003 and became a City of Culinary Delights in 2008.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name of the city, Graz, formerly spelled Gratz, most likely stems from the Slavic gradec, which means \"small castle\". Some archaeological finds point to the erection of a small castle by Alpine Slavic people, which over time became a heavily defended fortification. In literary Slovene and Croatian, gradec still means \"small castle\", forming a hypocoristic derivative of Proto-West-South Slavic *grad\u044cc\u044a, whichs descends via liquid metathesis from Common Slavic *gard\u044cc\u044a and via the Slavic third palatalisation from Proto-Slavic *gardiku, originally denoting \"small town, settlement\". The name thus follows the common South Slavic pattern for naming settlements as grad. The German name 'Graz' first appears in records in 1128.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGraz is situated on both sides of the Mur river in southeast Austria. It is about 200 km (120 mi) southwest of Vienna (Wien). The nearest larger urban centre is Maribor (Marburg) in Slovenia, which is about 50 km (31 mi) to the south. Graz is the state capital and largest city in Styria, a green and heavily forested region on the eastern edge of the Alps.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring municipalities ===\nThese towns and villages border Graz:\n\nto the north: Gratkorn, Stattegg, Weinitzen\nto the east: Kainbach bei Graz, Hart bei Graz, Raaba\nto the south: G\u00f6ssendorf, Feldkirchen bei Graz, Seiersberg\nto the west: Attendorf, Thal, Judendorf-Stra\u00dfengel\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nGraz is divided into 17 municipal districts (Stadtbezirke):\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement on the ground of the modern city of Graz dates back to the Copper Age. However, no historical continuity exists of a settlement before the Middle Ages.\nDuring the 12th century, dukes under Babenberg rule made the town into an important commercial center. Later, Graz came under the rule of the Habsburgs and, in 1281, gained special privileges from King Rudolph I.\nIn the 14th century, Graz became the city of residence of the Inner Austrian line of the Habsburgs. The royalty lived in the Schlossberg castle and from there ruled Styria, Carinthia, most of today's Slovenia, and parts of Italy (Carniola, Gorizia and Gradisca, Trieste).\nIn the 16th century, the city's design and planning were primarily controlled by Italian Renaissance architects and artists. One of the most famous buildings representative of this style is the Landhaus, designed by Domenico dell'Allio, and used by the local rulers as a governmental headquarters.\n\nThe University of Graz was founded by Archduke Karl II in 1585, it's the city's oldest university. For most of its existence, it was controlled by the Catholic church, and was closed in 1782 by Joseph II in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a lyceum where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-established as a university by Emperor Franz I, and was named 'Karl-Franzens Universit\u00e4t' or 'Charles-Francis University' in English. More than 30,000 students are currently enrolled at this university.\nThe astronomer Johannes Kepler lived in Graz for a short period. He worked as a math teacher and was a professor of mathematics at the University of Graz, but still found time to study astronomy. He left Graz for Prague when Lutherans were banned from the city.\nLudwig Boltzmann was Professor for Mathematical Physics from 1869 to 1890. During that time, Nikola Tesla studied electrical engineering at the Polytechnic in 1875. Nobel Laureate Otto Loewi taught at the University of Graz from 1909 until 1938. Ivo Andric, the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature Laureate obtained his doctorate at the University of Graz. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger was briefly chancellor of the University of Graz in 1936.\nGraz is centrally located within today's Bundesland (state) of Styria, or Steiermark in German. Mark is an old German word indicating a large area of land used as a defensive border, in which the peasantry is taught how to organize and fight in the case of an invasion. With a strategic location at the head of the open and fertile Mur valley, Graz was historically a target of invaders, such as the Hungarians under Matthias Corvinus in 1481, and the Ottoman Turks in 1529 and 1532. Apart from the Riegersburg Castle, the Schlossberg was the only fortification in the region that never fell to the Ottoman Turks. Graz is home to the region's provincial armory, which is the world's largest historical collection of late medieval and Renaissance weaponry. It has been preserved since 1551, and displays over 30,000 items.\nFrom the earlier part of the 15th century, Graz was the residence of the younger branch of the Habsburgs, which succeeded to the imperial throne in 1619 in the person of Emperor Ferdinand II, who moved the capital to Vienna. New fortifications were built on the Schlossberg at the end of the 16th century. Napoleon's army occupied Graz in 1797. In 1809, the city withstood another assault by the French army. During this attack, the commanding officer in the fortress was ordered to defend it with about 900 men against Napoleon's army of about 3,000. He successfully defended the Schlossberg against eight attacks, but they were forced to give up after the Grande Arm\u00e9e occupied Vienna and the Emperor ordered to surrender. Following the defeat of Austria by Napoleonic forces at the Battle of Wagram in 1809, the fortifications were demolished using explosives, as stipulated in the Peace of Sch\u00f6nbrunn of the same year. The belltower (Glockenturm) and the civic clock tower (Uhrturm), which is a leading tourist attraction and serves as a symbol for Graz, were spared after the citizens of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation.Archduke Karl II of Inner Austria had 20,000 Protestant books burned in the square of what is now a mental hospital, and succeeded in returning Styria to the authority of the Holy See. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was born in Graz in what is now the Stadtmuseum (city museum).\n\n\n== Population development ==\nThe more recent population figures do not give the whole picture as only people with principal-residence status are counted and people with secondary residence status are not. Most of the people with secondary residence status in Graz are students. At the end of 2016 there were 33,473 people with secondary residence status in Graz.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nOceanic climate is the type found in the city, but due to the 0 \u00b0C isotherm, the same occurs in a humid continental climate with based in K\u00f6ppen system (Cfb/Dfb borderline). Wladimir K\u00f6ppen himself was in town and conducted studies to see how the climate of the past influenced the Continental Drift theory. Due to its position southeast of the Alps, Graz is shielded from the prevailing westerly winds that bring weather fronts in from the North Atlantic to northwestern and central Europe. The weather in Graz is thus influenced by the Mediterranean, and it has more hours of sunshine per year than Vienna or Salzburg and also less wind or rain. Graz lies in a basin that is only open to the south, causing the climate to be warmer than would be expected at that latitude. Plants are found in Graz that normally grow much further south.\n\naverage temperatures: Graz Airport 8.7 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) / Karl-Franzens University 9.4 \u00b0C (49 \u00b0F)\naverage rainfall: 818 mm (32 in) with on average 92 days of rain (Karl Franzens University)\naverage hours of sunshine: 1,989 (Karl Franzens University)\n\n\n== Slovenes and Graz ==\nPolitically, culturally, scientifically and religiously, Graz was an important centre for all Slovenes, especially from the establishment of the University of Graz in 1586 until the establishment of University of Ljubljana in 1919. In 1574, the first Slovene Catholic book was published in Graz, and in 1592, Hieronymus Megiser published in Graz the book Dictionarium quatuor linguarum, the first multilingual dictionary of Slovene.The Styrian Slovenes did not consider Graz a German-speaking city, but their own, a place to study while living at their relatives' homes and to fulfill one's career ambitions. The student associations in Graz were a crucible of the Slovene identity, and the Slovene students in Graz were more nationally aware than some others. This led to fierce anti-Slovene efforts of German-speaking nationalists in Graz before and during World War II.Many Slovenian Styrians study there. Slovenes are among the professors at the Institute for Jazz in Graz. Numerous Slovenes have found employment there, while being formerly unemployed in Slovenia. For the Slovene culture, Graz remains permanently important due to its university and the Universalmuseum Joanneum archives containing numerous documents from the Slovenian Styria.A symposium on the relation of Graz and the Slovenes was held in Graz in 2010, at the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the first and oldest chair of Slovene. It was established at the Lyzeum of Graz in July 1811 on the initiative of Janez Nepomuk Primic. A collection of lectures on the topic was published. The Slovenian Post commemorated the anniversary with a stamp.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nFor the year that Graz was Cultural Capital of Europe, new structures were erected. The Graz Museum of Contemporary Art (German: Kunsthaus) was designed by Peter Cook and Colin Fournier and is situated next to the Mur river. The Island in the Mur is a floating platform made of steel. It was designed by American architect Vito Acconci and contains a caf\u00e9, an open-air theatre and a playground.\n\n\n=== Historic city centre ===\n\nThe historic centre was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999 due to the harmonious co-existence of typical buildings from different epochs and in different architectural styles. Situated in a cultural borderland between Central Europe, Italy and the Balkan States, Graz absorbed various influences from the neighbouring regions and thus received its exceptional townscape. Today the historic centre consists of over 1,000 buildings, their age ranging from Gothic to contemporary.\nThe most important sights in the historic centre are:\n\nTown Hall (Rathaus).\nThe Castle hill (German: Schlossberg), a hill dominating the historic centre (475 m (1,558.40 ft) high), site of a demolished fortress, with views over Graz.\nThe Clock Tower (Uhrturm) is a symbol of Graz, at the top of the Castle hill.\nThe New Gallery (Neue Galerie), a museum of art.\nThe Castle hill funicular (Schlossbergbahn), a funicular railway on the Castle hill's slope.\nThe seat of Styria's provincial parliament (Landhaus), a palace in Lombardic style.

It features the oldest painted view of Graz.\nThe mausoleum of Emperor Ferdinand II next to the cathedral, the most important building of Mannerism in Graz. It includes both the grave where Ferdinand II and his wife are buried, and a church dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria.\nThe Castle (Burg), with Gothic double staircase, built between 1438 and 1453 by Emperor Frederick III, because the old castle on the Schlossberg hill was too small and uncomfortable.

It's still facing referendum, meaning usually the end for many former olympic bids in Europe and North America since 1970 -century.\n\n\n=== Styriarte ===\nGraz hosts the annual festival of classical music Styriarte, founded in 1985 to tie conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt closer to his hometown. Events have been held at different venues in Graz and in the surrounding region.\n\n\n=== Dialect ===\nReferred to as Steirisch by locals, Graz belongs to the Austro-Bavarian region of dialects, more specifically a mix of Central Bavarian in the western part of Styria and Southern Bavarian in the eastern part. The Grazer ORF, the Graz subsidiary of Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, launched an initiative in 2008 called Scho wieda Steirisch g'redt in order to highlight the numerous dialects of Graz and Styria in general and to cultivate the pride many Styrians hold for their local culture. Two reasons for a melding of these dialects with Standard German: the influence of television and radio bringing Standard German into the home and the industrialization causing the disappearance of the single farmer since the farming communities are seen as the true keepers of dialect speaking.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nAn extensive public transport network makes Graz an easy city to navigate without a car. The city has a comprehensive bus network, complementing the Graz tram network consisting of eight lines. Four lines pass through the underground tram stop at the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof) and on to the city centre before branching out. Furthermore, there are seven night-time bus routes, although these run only at weekends and on evenings preceding public holidays.\nThe Schlossbergbahn, a funicular railway, and the Schlossberg lift, a vertical lift, link the city centre to the Schlossberg.\nFrom the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), regional trains link to most of Styria. Direct trains run to most major cities nearby including Vienna, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Maribor and Ljubljana in Slovenia, Zagreb in Croatia, Budapest in Hungary, Prague and Brno in the Czech Republic, Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland, as well as Munich, Stuttgart, Heidelberg, and Frankfurt in Germany. Trains for Vienna leave every hour. In recent years many railway stations within the city limits and in the suburbs have been rebuilt or modernised and are now part of the \"S-Bahn Graz\", a commuter train service connecting the city with its suburban area and towns nearby.\nGraz airport is located about 10 km (6 mi) south of the city centre and is accessible by bus, railway, and car. Direct destinations include Amsterdam, Berlin, D\u00fcsseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart, Istanbul, Vienna and Zurich.\n\n\n== Health ==\nIn Graz there are seven hospitals, several private hospitals and sanatoriums, as well as 44 pharmacies.\nThe University Hospital Graz (LKH-Universit\u00e4ts-Klinikum Graz) is located in eastern Graz and has 1,556 beds and 7,190 employees. The Regional Hospital Graz II (LKH Graz II) has two sites in Graz. The western site (LKH Graz II Standort West) is located in Eggenberg and has 280 beds and about 500 employees, the southern site (LKH Graz II Standort S\u00fcd) specializes in neurology and psychiatry and is located in Stra\u00dfgang with 880 beds and 1,100 employees. The AUVA Accident Hospital (Unfallkrankenhaus der AUVA) is in Eggenberg and has 180 beds and a total of 444 employees.\nThe Albert Schweitzer Clinic in the western part of the city is a geriatric hospital with 304 beds, the Hospital of St. John of God (Krankenhaus der Barmherzigen Br\u00fcder) has two sites in Graz, one in Lend with 225 beds and one in Eggenberg with 260 beds. The Hospital of the Order of Saint Elizabeth (Krankenhaus der Elisabethinen) in Gries has 182 beds.\nThere are several private clinics as well: the Privatklinik Kastanienhof, the Privatklinik Leech, the Privatklinik der Kreuzschwestern, the Sanatorium St. Leonhard, the Sanatorium Hansa and the Privatklinik Graz-Ragnitz.\nEMS in Graz is provided solely by the Austrian Red Cross. Perpetually two emergency doctor's cars (NEF \u2013 Notarzteinsatzfahrzeug), two NAWs (Notarztwagen \u2013 ambulances staffed with a physician in addition to regular personnel) and about 30 RTWs (Rettungswagen \u2013 regular ambulances) are on standby. Furthermore, several non-emergency ambulances (KTW \u2013 Krankentransportwagen) and a Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) are operated by the Red Cross to transport non-emergency patients to and between hospitals. In addition to the Red Cross, the Labourers'-Samaritan-Alliance (Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund \u00d6sterreichs), the Austrian organisation of the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps (Malteser Hospitaldienst Austria) and the Green Cross (Gr\u00fcnes Kreuz) operate ambulances (KTW) for non-emergency patient transport. In addition to the cars, there's also the C12 air ambulance helicopter stationed at Graz airport, staffed with an emergency physician in addition to regular personnel.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nGraz is twinned with:\n\nOther forms of cooperation and city friendship similar to the twin city programmes\n Ni\u0161, Serbia\n Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nThe following are past and present notable residents of Graz.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Austria portal\nList of World Heritage Sites in Austria\nKastner & \u00d6hler\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"Graz: Stadtplanung und Stadtentwicklung (Rechnungshofbericht, 2006) in German\" (PDF). 2006.

        "wiki": "The Universalmuseum Joanneum is a multidisciplinary museum with buildings in several locations in the province of Styria, Austria. It has galleries and collections in many subject areas including archaeology, geology, paleontology, mineralogy, botany, zoology, history, art and folk culture. It is the oldest museum in Austria as well as the largest universal museum in central Europe with over 4.5 million objects in 13 departments and 12 locations in the Styrian cities of Graz, Stainz, Trautenfels, and Wagna (Flavia Solva). To reflect this status and its growth over the last two centuries, as well as to present a more recognizable image internationally, the Landesmuseum Joanneum was officially renamed to Universalmuseum Joanneum on 10 September 2009.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Landesmuseum Joanneum was established in 1811 by Archduke Johann. It was Austria's first museum as well as a center for continuing education and scientific research. Notably, the Coin Cabinet and the mineralogical collection were extensive, private collections belonging to the archduke. They form the heart of the museum's departments in disciplines from both the humanities and the natural sciences. Around this core of collections, some of the best scientists of the era taught and conducted research: Friedrich Mohs developed the Mohs scale of mineral hardness there and Franz Unger, a pioneer in paleobotany, plant physiology, phytotomy and soil science, taught here. In 1864, the Joanneum entered the ranks of the \"k.k. technical colleges\".Following the decision to raise the institution into the ranks of imperial colleges, as well as for organizational reasons and the need for more space, the institution was split in 1887. The college became the Graz University of Technology, and the collections of the Joanneum, both scientific and cultural-historical, were combined into the Landesmuseum Joanneum.\nThe Joanneum show collections occurred in the \"Lesliehof\" along the Raubergasse in Graz just off the main square. However, the collections soon outgrew the confines of the residence. A new museum building was erected between 1890 and 1895, along the Neutorgasse in Graz directly behind the Lesliehof. This building, designed in the neobaroque style by August Gunold, became the \u201cNew Joanneum\u201d. Beginning in 2009, both buildings, as well as the open ground between them, underwent extensive renovation and construction. A new, central, underground entrance and three-story, underground depot adjoining both buildings and the Styrian Provincial Library, which was also part of the original 1811 Joanneum, was constructed creating. During the Joanneum's bicentennial in 2011, in the renovated Neutorgasse building, the Neue Galerie art museum and the multimedia collection opened. Thereafter the Museum of Nature and Science enjoyed a redesign in its original, albeit renovated, location in the Lesliehof.\nUntil 2003, the Joanneum was governed by the Styrian regional government. In 2003, coinciding with the designation of Graz as the sole European Capital of Culture for that year, the Joanneum was spun off into a GmbH (Limited Liability Company). While the Joanneum gained some autonomy in business, marketing and budgetary decision-making with this move, the Province of Styria remains the successor of Archduke Johann and retains all ownership and property rights to the buildings and collections.\nThe museum is the largest of its kind in central Europe and second only to the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna in size for Austrian museums in general. The Joanneum employs an international team of about 500 people across fields from visitor services to acquisitions, conservation and preservation to scientific research. The more than 4.5 million objects among the various collections as well as historical buildings and locations form the basis of a multifaceted exhibition program. Steeped in tradition, the Joanneum collects, preserves, conserves, researches and conveys a broad spectrum of information dealing with the nature, history, culture and art of Styria in an international context with an eye towards the future.\n\n\n== Locations and collections ==\n\n\n=== Graz ===\n\n\n==== Styrian Armory ====\nThe Landeszeughaus originally was the central weapons depot of the Duchy of Styria during the Ottoman Wars. It is the only remaining armory of its type in the world. The installation remained largely unchanged for nearly 400 years and provides the atmosphere of an authentic armory of the 17th century. 32,000 exhibits are housed in the collection; suits of armor, coats of mail, helmets, melee weapons, firearms and other engines of war. The military history of Styria is illustrated with its own exhibition in the cannon hall.\n\n\n==== Folkloristic Museum ====\nThe Volkskundemuseum houses the oldest and most extensive collection of folkloristic and folk culture objects in Styria. It was opened in 1913, and is located in a former Capuchin cloister just inside Graz's only remaining Renaissance city-gate, the Paulustor (St. Paul's Gate), erected under Ferdinand II. The library of folklore contains over 14,000 individual volumes as well as an archive of original material and over 20,000 slides and historic photographs documenting the life of rural Styria. The exhibits offer insights into the rural culture and lifestyle of pre-industrial Styria. The collection emphasizes the life, fashion and beliefs of the Styrian people,  showing the social and cultural relations between the person and the objects left behind. Specific features of the collection are the original smoking room and the tracht hall. The complex also includes the Antoniuskirche (Church of St. Anthony) with original paintings by Giovanni Pietro de Pomis and Hans Adam Weissenkircher where the traditional \"Styrian Shepherds' and Nativity Songs\" are presented annually along with new compositions by local composers.\n\n\n==== Museum im Palais ====\nThe Styrian Treasury holds the cultural history collection of the Joanneum and encompasses around 35,000 objects from all areas of the aesthetically informed way of life \u2013 from the Middle Ages up to the present-day: They bear witness to Styrian history and offer examples of life among Styrian royalty and nobility as well as the domestic life of the aristocracy and middle-class; artisans' crafts in metal, wood, ivory, ceramic, glass and textiles as well as collections of wrought iron objects, tracht and musical instruments are presented. The Styrian ducal hat, the magnificent coach of Emperor Frederick III and a stone coat of arms from the Graz Castle count among the most significant objects in the collection. To coincide with the Joanneum's bicentennial year, the cultural history collection opened the Museum im Palais in Summer 2011 in the former Herberstein city palace along the Grazer Sackstrasse and presents a newly designed permanent exhibition complemented by special exhibitions.\nThe Museum im Palais is housed in the former Palais Herberstein and, in addition to the show collection and temporary exhibitions, also opens the Baroque staterooms to visitors. The Palais Herberstein was originally renovated into a Baroque city palace for the Princes of Eggenberg by Austrian architect Joseph Hueber. The palace passed into the possession of a branch of the Herberstein family in 1774 after the extinction of the male line of Eggenberg heirs.\n\n\n==== Joanneum Quarter ====\nThe Joanneum Quarter (German: Joanneumsviertel) includes the original Joanneum building on the Raubergasse as well as the Neutorgasse building and the Styrian Provincial Library. A grand entrance provides access to all three buildings. A three story deep, subterranean depot for the library's collections between the three buildings.\n\n\n===== Neue Galerie =====\nThe Neue Galerie Graz originated in 1941 with the division of the Provincial Art Gallery founded in 1811 as part of the Joanneum into the Alte Galerie\u2013comprising Medieval to Baroque artworks up to 1800\u2013and the Neue Galerie Graz\u2013comprising works beginning with Neoclassicism, Romanticism, Realism and Modern art. The museum has an extensive collection of pedagogic art from the 19th and 20th centuries featuring works by Austrian artists including Ferdinand Georg Waldm\u00fcller, Egon Schiele, Gustav Klimt, Maria Lassnig and Arnulf Rainer as well as international artists such as Marcel Duchamp, Robert Rauschenberg and Fred Sandback. The gallery focuses on procuring and exhibiting an ever-growing collection of contemporary art.\nThe Neue Galerie Graz houses an extensive collection of some 40,000 graphics as well as photographs, film and video collections. Like the K\u00fcnstlerhaus Graz and the KHG, the Neue Galerie Graz provides a venue for contemporary artists, both local and international, with a variety of temporary exhibitions. Among these contemporary artists, controversial Styrian artist G\u00fcnter Brus was to have his own permanent exhibition space, called the Bruseum, in the newly renovated \"Neutorgasse\" building in the Joanneum Quarter.\n\n\n===== Multimedia collections =====\nThe multimedia collections (formerly known as the Picture and Tone Archives) were established in 1960 to collect photographic, film and audio material relating to Styria for research and educational purposes and to make these materials available to the general public. The collection presently consists of more than 2.5 million photographs, tens of thousands of audio recordings and thousands of films that document the development of the Bundesland of Styria from the dawn of the era of photography, film and audio recording.\n\n\n===== Museum of nature and science =====\nIn 2009 the scientific departments of the Joanneum moved to the Center for Natural History in the Andritz district of Graz. This center cares for the collections and continues scientific research with contemporary means. Steeped in tradition, these departments form the core of the original Joanneum established by Archduke Johann. It offers interdisciplinary exhibitions of botany, zoology, geology and paleontology, and mineralogy.\nCoSA - Center of Science Activities\nThe Center of Science Activities (CoSA) is a science center in the natural history museum of the Graz Joanneumsviertel, in which technology and natural sciences are taught in a low-threshold way. It was opened in 2019 after a four-year planning phase as a joint project of the Graz Children's Museum FRida & freD and the Universalmuseum Joanneum. A worldwide unique feature of the CoSA is the combination of storytelling, augmented reality and gamification for knowledge transfer in the museum sector.\n\n\n====== Botany ======\nFerns, flowering plants, mushrooms and mosses\u2013dried, pressed, stretched and packed in paper capsules. The core of the botanical collection consists of more than half a million well-preserved plants. Special collections of fruits and seeds as well as models of fruits and an extensive xylotheque (library of woods) complement the herbarium, which shows a comprehensive archive of Styrian flora and the base for research projects on local vegetation. Franz Unger did some of his early teaching and research in this department while he resided in Graz.\n\n\n====== Zoology ======\nThe collection encompasses about 850,000 specimens typical of their respective habitats. Vertebrates take up the largest portion of the collection. Examples from other regions\u2014from the seashores to the original fauna of Australia\u2014round-out the collection inventory. The primary focuses of the scientific collections are, among other things, insects and mollusks among the invertebrate animals as well as skeletons and bird's eggs among the vertebrates.\n\n\n====== Geology and paleontology ======\n500 million years Styrian history are gathered here: Fossilized remains of earlier living beings reveal information about ice ages, tropical seas, ancient forests and marshes. Beside the mammoths and mastodons, the cave bears and the giant deer, corals, mussels and fish are found among the core specimens of the collection. Since 1998 the department of Geology and Paleontology has organized fossil digs with schools.\n\n\n====== Mineralogy ======\nAs with the coin cabinet collection, the mineralogical collection traces its origin to the private collection of Archduke Johann, which encompassed several thousand pieces at that time. Today the inventory has grown to about 80,000 specimens. The collection presents minerals from across the world as well as a Styrian regional collection. The mineralogy department of the Joanneum was where Friedrich Mohs developed the Mohs scale of mineral hardness which remains authoritative. He was the first curator of the Joanneum.\n\n\n==== Schloss Eggenberg ====\n\n\n===== Staterooms and gardens =====\nSchloss Eggenberg was added to the registry of the Graz Old Town as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2010. Schloss Eggenberg is the most significant palace ensemble in Styria and is surrounded by an extensive, scenic garden. The palace, designed by court architect Giovanni Pietro de Pomis, according to the inspiration of the Spanish El Escorial, is both an opulent residence intended to convey the wealth, might and status of owner-builder Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg as well as a complex allegory of the cosmos. Central to the multifaceted conception are an ensemble of historic interior rooms. The cycle of 24 staterooms with original accouterments and period furnishings from the 17th and 18th centuries counts among the most significant ensembles of historic interiors in Austria. The climax of this piano nobile is the Planetary Room, which owes its name to the cycle of ceiling and wall paintings (completed in 1685) that adorn it, by court painter Hans Adam Weissenkircher. His elegant melding of astrological and hermetic images, numerology and family mythology into a complicated allegory of the \"Golden Age\" of the House of Eggenberg is counted among the most important and impressive systems of early Baroque room-art in Central Europe.\nNine hectares of gardens, mostly overgrown and lost through decades of neglect by the end of World War II, were restored or reconstructed as a living monument to Romanticism and bear the influence of the last gardener to own the palace, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Count Herberstein. In the early 19th century, Count Herberstein had the palace grounds transformed into a picturesque English garden.\n\n\n===== Alte Galerie =====\n\nThe collections of the Alte Galerie Graz contain works by old masters of European art from the Middle Ages through the 18th century. The 22-room show collection in Schloss Eggenberg follows a thematic design by subject matter. Objects of Romanesque art such as the \"St. Nicholas Sacristy Door\", Gothic art including the St. Lambrecht Votive Altarpiece, the world-renowned \"Admont Madonna\" and the \"Death Portrait of Maximilian I\" or a portrait of his first wife Mary, Duchess of Burgundy and the Greater and Lesser Miracle Altars of Mariazell are among the collection of medieval art. Beginning with the Renaissance and going through Mannerism to the late Baroque, works by Lucas Cranach the Elder, Dosso Dossi, Sofonisba Anguissola, Bartholomeus Spranger, Pieter Brueghel the Younger, Martin Johann Schmidt and Angelica Kauffman are on display in the early modern period collection. The inventory of the printroom of the Alte Galerie Graz is extensive and contains hand drawings and print graphics from 1500 till the end of the 18th century. Among these are extensive works by Rembrandt, Albrecht D\u00fcrer and Giambattista Piranesi.\n\n\n===== Coin cabinet =====\nThe Coin Cabinet also traces its origin to the private collection of Archduke Johann. With over 70,000 objects, it is currently the second largest, public coin collection in Austria. Through a combination of state-of-the-art technology and historical items, the coins, currency and equipment related to minting trace the history of regional coin circulation and minting from the prehistoric era to the eurozone. Among the most significant pieces are coins from finds in and around Styria that were in circulation at the time of the Roman Empire. Additionally, Friesacher and Grazer Pfennigs from the Middle Ages and coins and medallions from the Inner Austrian mints in Graz, Klagenfurt and St. Veit an der Glan as well as from other lands of the Austro-Hungarian Empire are on display. The collection traces the history of coin mintage and names from around the world with prehistoric Celtic coins from the region, shells, early forms of paper currency and the euro in addition to international coins of historic significance minted in Africa, the US, and by the Dutch East India Company among others. The permanent collection, with an additional room for temporary exhibitions, is fittingly situated in the oldest portion of palace dating to the late Middle Ages and once belonging to Balthasar Eggenberger, mint master and financier to Emperor Frederick III in the early days of Mercantilism.\n\n\n===== Archaeology Museum and Lapidarium =====\nThe Archaeology museum and lapidarium is Located adjacent to the Planetary Garden and Lapidarium at Schloss Eggenberg. It hosts an array of over 1200 objects from past social environments. The second largest archaeological collection of Austria unites evidence of human existence from \"Styrian\" prehistory with findings from Classical Antiquity, the Ancient Near East and Ancient Egypt. A unique attraction is the Cult Wagon of Strettweg, found among grave goods from the Hallstatt culture.It  underwent an extensive restoration. One of the most significant Roman stonemasonry collections of the eastern Alps is in the adjacent Lapidarium: 96 stones, including gravestones, monuments, medallions and round sculptures, three large remnants of mosaic floors as well as a prominent exhibit, the nearly three meter high grave stele of L. Cantius.Akin to the archaeology museum is the Roman Museum of Flavia Solva near the southern Styrian town of Wagna. (see below)\n\n\n===== Museumsakademie Joanneum =====\nThe Museumsakademie Joanneum encourages further education, training and research in museology, museum planning, interpretive planning, exhibit design and museum management..It is headquartered in one of the Eggenberg garden houses and works with an international network of museums and local institutions including the University of Graz and the Graz University of Technology, It provides a platform and resources for discussions with international researchers in museology and museological theory in order to promote the continuing development of both the Joanneum and of museological practices and research around the world.\n\n\n==== Exhibition houses ====\n\n\n===== K\u00fcnstlerhaus Graz =====\nOpening in 1952, the K\u00fcnstlerhaus Graz (Artists' House) has served for six decades as a venue for promoting contemporary artists from Styria. It is located between the Grazer Old Town and the University Quarter just outside Graz's only remaining Gothic city gate, the \"Burgtor\" (Castle Gate). It was erected under Frederick III, H.R.R.  K\u00fcnstlerhaus Graz provides a space for contemporary artists from in and around Styria to engage the public with their work. As part of the preparations for the city of Graz's tenure as the 2003 European Capital of Culture it was integrated into the Universalmuseum Joanneum and continues to serve this function.\n\n\n===== Kunsthaus Graz =====\nKunsthaus Graz presents architecture, design, new media, CGI, film and photography under one roof. The \"facility was dubbed \"Friendly Alien\" by its designers Peter Cook and Colin Fournier. It offers spectacular architecture and exhibitions by international, contemporary artists from the late 20th century onwards. A special highlight of this blob architecture building is the \"Needle\": a glass viewing platform that looks out across the Mur River towards the Graz city center and the Grazer Schlossberg. The BIX fa\u00e7ade on the eastern (Mur) face of the KHG serves as an \"urban screen\" with 925 programmable fluorescent lamps that display messages and moving patterns of light on the surroundings.\n\n\n==== Austrian Sculpture Park ====\nMore than 60 sculptures are embedded in a seven-hectare park with rose mounds, lotus blossom ponds and labyrinths on the southern outskirts of Graz. Since its founding in 2003, the Austrian Sculpture Park offers visitors a scenic overview of\u2014mainly Austrian, but also international\u2014contemporary sculpture and sculptural art as well as the rolling gardens of Swiss landscape architect Dieter Kienast. In 2008 the collection was extended by the donation of the Painting to Hammer a Nail in / Cross Version by artist Yoko Ono.\n\n\n=== Throughout Styria ===\n\n\n==== Roman Museum ====\nFlavia Solva is the most significant Roman era find in modern-day Styria. It is located near a hill on the edge of the town of Wagna, overlooking the Mur River. The town developed near an existing settlement of Celts centered on the nearby hill, the Frauenberg near Leibnitz. It gained full status as a Roman city by grant of a municipal charter by Vespasian in 70 AD. The settlement expanded and the Celtic populations adopted Roman ways and technology. It offers a viewing platform and showroom built overlooking excavated Roman ruins. This museum offers visitors a glimpse into the everyday life, worship, and death cults of what was once the most cultured town of the Roman province of Noricum.\n\n\n==== Schloss Trautenfels ====\nThe Baroque palace of Schloss Trautenfels is situated at the foot of the Grimming on a protruding cliff in the municipality P\u00fcrgg-Trautenfels. In the Middle Ages the cliff protrusion held a small damn on the Enns River until the 16th century. In 1664 the area was bought by the Styrian provincial governor, Count Siegmund Friedrich von Trauttmansdorff and subsequently converted and expanded by him into an early Baroque residence that bears his name. The staterooms feature both Renaissance and Baroque frescoes and paintings as well as the Antler Room of the Counts of Lemberg, and the stunning Marble Hall all of which are open to visitors.\n\n\n===== Regional Landscape and Folkloristic Museum =====\nBeginning in the 1950s a concerted effort was made to collect objects relating to the natural and cultural history of the Ennstal region of Upper Styria and the Styrian Salzkammergut. Both the splendor of the landscape and the palace itself are on display. Objects of geological interest as well as the rural domestic life of the region are on display. The exhibition also displays exhibits recollecting the historic transitions and their impact on the people, such as the Reformation and Counter-Reformation. The permanent show collection presents about 1000 exhibits relating to both the land and the people over the course of history in of the Ennstal Valley as well as the Ausseerland from the Middle Ages to the early modern era.\n\n\n==== Schloss Stainz ====\nSchloss Stainz is a former Augustinian Canons Regular monastery purchased by Archduke Johann in 1840 and remains in the estate of his heirs, the Counts of Meran. Various rooms, terraces and arcades are available to rent for private functions. The former monastery houses two collections:\n\n\n===== Hunting Museum =====\nThe design of this exhibition treats the hunt as a historical, sociological and philosophical-ethical phenomenon. It offers the visitor a chance to examine the connections of hunting, ecology and nature. The interdisciplinary approach to this exhibition combines Baroque animal trophies, historical tools and weapons, paintings and artwork with state-of-the-art technology and museum design to illustrate the development of the hunt from the Stone Age through Roman times up to the time of nobles and the early days of the middle-class.\n\n\n===== Agriculture Museum =====\nThe main focus of the agriculture collection is to show the rural farming, husbandry and forestry techniques prior to industrialization as well as the implements and photographic evidence relating to these practices. Original room furnishings from the 17th and 18th centuries provide a view into the different dimensions of rural life in Styria. The open areas hold a smithy, a cabbage pit, herb garden, an orchard and a small field to demonstrate various aspects of this pre-industrial, rural lifestyle.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nVan Uffelen, Chris.

          "Nice surprise - interesting museum in Karya Tour is short in a good sense. You can see lots of things and see how people used to work and live back at those days.",
          "When you are in the sweet little village of Karya, and you see the street sign for the Folklore Museum, follow them! An elderly man will be there and will point out a few historical objects, such as a wine press, etc., and then you go into the house his one-handed ?grandmother",
          "And I mean it. He is the owner of the museum and in a way part of its interesting history. Technically the whole museum is his ex-house as well and if you combine this with the fact that his family took great care of their belongings (clothing/furniture/area/machinery) then you",
          "This private museum is owned and operated by someone that loves the history of this small Greek village - Karya. My family has comes from this village and the museum represents us in the best possible way. It is a must see!",
          "We spent a wonderful time being shown around this amazing building full of wonderfully interesting artifacts. Definitely worth a visit. Very friendly and knowledgeable guide - the son of the owner.",
          "The museum is run by a father and son whose previous generation lived in the building andwas the shool for learning local embroidary. There are lots of old artifacts from years gone-by showing how village people lived and worked. The main ebent is the emboidery work and history",
          "We stopped without planning, just drove to the village and came across the sign. The museum is operated by a local family with strong connection to the place, and we felt it immediately. The Father & his son are very emotional & gives personal experience. You can see very old",
          "Amazing life of the Lefkadians. Must see place! The kitten was so cude, the owner is very friendly.Thank you for the assist.",
          "It\u2019s an odd little place that\u2019s a bit worn, but the owner is really friendly and accommodating, plus it gave us an indoor spot to avoid the heavy rain! It\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag, the historic information about local weaving wasn\u2019t really my thing (although it was beautiful) but",
          "It's nice to see some of the occupations of people from previous generations and how they lived in this area.",
          "Exhibits of real living... the beds were especially interesting as were some of the clothes. So heavy! Some of the workmanship is exquisite the stitches are tiny and the reverse as neat as the best side. Inspiring if you have ever made anything in your life! I loved the chilled",
          "Great little museum. Very interesting insight into pre industrial life on the island. Private museum obviously a labour of love for the curator/owner. Definitely worth a few hours off the beach!",
          "We passed by car and made stop by the sign. So happy we stoped. A house full of history. Well worth the time!",
          "Fantastic folklore museum shown by the second generation son and we also got the opportunity to meet his father who started the museum. A really must stop place when at Lefkas",
          "Great insight into the traditional greek way of living. Most practices are no longer used and have been replaced by modern means of production. The town has a few tavernas where you can enjoy a drink and wonderful views towards the mainland.",
          "Visited this place with our rep high in the mountains, so a place that hasnt been touched by time. Greeted by a greek man who didnt know a lot of english. He shows us around his grandmothers school of embroidery and his old house which is all in one building. He even gets you to",
          "Went up into the mountains to Karya and had a look around for something to do. Saw the museum wasn't far so headed up the steep slope. Upon arriving we had a little tour downstairs with a family member before the real tour began upstairs with an elderly guy who turned out to be",

          "We spent a couple of hours in the company of a very nice and knowledgable chap who had lived in the museum (it was his home) a most rewarding visit,and we will go again in the future.one note of caution there are a lot of steps to climb but it\u2019s worth it",
          "This is one of those locations that you will definitely remember for a long time. Everything here is more than you could expect! :) As previous reviews stated, guide command of English is just...during visit you find somewhat lacking but later you realize that he explained",
          "Although this place tells you it is open from 9..00 until 21.00, when there is no-one there except a big dog, which was not too friendly, it is hard to actually go in there. In all fairness we were there at the end of the season, so perhaps they were fed up waiting for no-one",
          "A really interesting experience. An old village house, like a Tardis (much bigger on the inside than you think). Run by an old local man and his son. Lots of interest, although the main theme is the history of an unusual style of embroidery. Now that may sound boring, but",
          "We are still laughing. The landlord is everything - owner, guide, clerk, fan of Maria Koutso Hero and enthusiast. His english abilities equal to five phrases - Maj mader, maj vater, no foto, foto, plis. Despite of these facts we definitely recommed the visit. 4\u20ac for",
          "The most awkward experience we had here. The owner (a 70ish men) guided us through this private museum. His mother and grand mother - every female in his family - learned here making embroidery stitch. What made it awkward? The guy knows 15 English words and it seemed enough",
          "As previous reviewers have said, this museum is important for showing the history of embroidery in Karya. But, more than that it was an amazingly bizarre tour by a gentleman who should get an award for most entertaining tour guide. What an experience, we're still laughing.",
          "A really lovely museum and the story of Maria who made lace with her left hand due to an accident in her youth. She taught lace-making.",

          "A amazing story of a one armed great aunt who developed a technique to embroider with a single hand. It was so good she started a school of one handed embroidery (I think that was the story!). Bizarre places like this are getting thin on the ground, so you must see it whilst you",
          "The village in a gem and a meal in the square is a great place to eat. The museum is unusual and interesting but the man who shows you round has little english which is unusual for most people on the island. It's a pity that at the end of the visit you are made to feel guilty if",

The town was first mentioned in the year AD 860 as Strazinolum.The fourteenth century Gothic pilgrimage church was constructed between 1346 and 1355, and contains an important high altar. Once surrounded by fortified walls and guarded by a three-story tower (1355\u201366) with elaborate stonemasonry, the church still retains 77 sections of its fourteenth century Gothic stained-glass windows. The original plans for the high altar in white marble (1885) were originally drawn by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach in 1687 but never carried out. The pilgrimage church contains a piece of tree root shaped like Jesus on the cross. This root is not displayed to the public, but shown to people on request.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMaria Strassengel Pilgrimage Church (Region Graz)",

        "wiki": "Graz ( GRAHTS, German: [\u0261\u0281a\u02d0ts] (listen); Slovene: Gradec) is the capital city of Styria and Austria's second-largest city after Vienna. As of 1 January 2019, Graz had a population of 328,276 (292,269 of whom had principal-residence status). In 2015, the population of the Graz larger urban zone (LUZ) stood at 633,168, based on principal-residence status. Graz has a long tradition as a seat of higher education. It has four colleges and four universities with more than 60,000 students. Its historic centre  (Altstadt) is one of the best-preserved city centres in Central Europe.For centuries, Graz was more important to Slovenes and Croats, both politically and culturally, than the capitals of Ljubljana, Slovenia and Zagreb, Croatia; it remains influential to this day. In 1999, the city's historic centre was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites and in 2010 the designation was expanded to include Eggenberg Palace (German: Schloss Eggenberg) on the western edge of the city. Graz was designated the Cultural Capital of Europe in 2003 and became a City of Culinary Delights in 2008.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name of the city, Graz, formerly spelled Gratz, most likely stems from the Slavic gradec, which means \"small castle\". Some archaeological finds point to the erection of a small castle by Alpine Slavic people, which over time became a heavily defended fortification. In literary Slovene and Croatian, gradec still means \"small castle\", forming a hypocoristic derivative of Proto-West-South Slavic *grad\u044cc\u044a, whichs descends via liquid metathesis from Common Slavic *gard\u044cc\u044a and via the Slavic third palatalisation from Proto-Slavic *gardiku, originally denoting \"small town, settlement\". The name thus follows the common South Slavic pattern for naming settlements as grad. The German name 'Graz' first appears in records in 1128.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGraz is situated on both sides of the Mur river in southeast Austria. It is about 200 km (120 mi) southwest of Vienna (Wien). The nearest larger urban centre is Maribor (Marburg) in Slovenia, which is about 50 km (31 mi) to the south. Graz is the state capital and largest city in Styria, a green and heavily forested region on the eastern edge of the Alps.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring municipalities ===\nThese towns and villages border Graz:\n\nto the north: Gratkorn, Stattegg, Weinitzen\nto the east: Kainbach bei Graz, Hart bei Graz, Raaba\nto the south: G\u00f6ssendorf, Feldkirchen bei Graz, Seiersberg\nto the west: Attendorf, Thal, Judendorf-Stra\u00dfengel\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nGraz is divided into 17 municipal districts (Stadtbezirke):\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement on the ground of the modern city of Graz dates back to the Copper Age. However, no historical continuity exists of a settlement before the Middle Ages.\nDuring the 12th century, dukes under Babenberg rule made the town into an important commercial center. Later, Graz came under the rule of the Habsburgs and, in 1281, gained special privileges from King Rudolph I.\nIn the 14th century, Graz became the city of residence of the Inner Austrian line of the Habsburgs. The royalty lived in the Schlossberg castle and from there ruled Styria, Carinthia, most of today's Slovenia, and parts of Italy (Carniola, Gorizia and Gradisca, Trieste).\nIn the 16th century, the city's design and planning were primarily controlled by Italian Renaissance architects and artists. One of the most famous buildings representative of this style is the Landhaus, designed by Domenico dell'Allio, and used by the local rulers as a governmental headquarters.\n\nThe University of Graz was founded by Archduke Karl II in 1585, it's the city's oldest university. For most of its existence, it was controlled by the Catholic church, and was closed in 1782 by Joseph II in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a lyceum where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-established as a university by Emperor Franz I, and was named 'Karl-Franzens Universit\u00e4t' or 'Charles-Francis University' in English. More than 30,000 students are currently enrolled at this university.\nThe astronomer Johannes Kepler lived in Graz for a short period. He worked as a math teacher and was a professor of mathematics at the University of Graz, but still found time to study astronomy. He left Graz for Prague when Lutherans were banned from the city.\nLudwig Boltzmann was Professor for Mathematical Physics from 1869 to 1890. During that time, Nikola Tesla studied electrical engineering at the Polytechnic in 1875. Nobel Laureate Otto Loewi taught at the University of Graz from 1909 until 1938. Ivo Andric, the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature Laureate obtained his doctorate at the University of Graz. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger was briefly chancellor of the University of Graz in 1936.\nGraz is centrally located within today's Bundesland (state) of Styria, or Steiermark in German. Mark is an old German word indicating a large area of land used as a defensive border, in which the peasantry is taught how to organize and fight in the case of an invasion. With a strategic location at the head of the open and fertile Mur valley, Graz was historically a target of invaders, such as the Hungarians under Matthias Corvinus in 1481, and the Ottoman Turks in 1529 and 1532. Apart from the Riegersburg Castle, the Schlossberg was the only fortification in the region that never fell to the Ottoman Turks. Graz is home to the region's provincial armory, which is the world's largest historical collection of late medieval and Renaissance weaponry. It has been preserved since 1551, and displays over 30,000 items.\nFrom the earlier part of the 15th century, Graz was the residence of the younger branch of the Habsburgs, which succeeded to the imperial throne in 1619 in the person of Emperor Ferdinand II, who moved the capital to Vienna. New fortifications were built on the Schlossberg at the end of the 16th century. Napoleon's army occupied Graz in 1797. In 1809, the city withstood another assault by the French army. During this attack, the commanding officer in the fortress was ordered to defend it with about 900 men against Napoleon's army of about 3,000. He successfully defended the Schlossberg against eight attacks, but they were forced to give up after the Grande Arm\u00e9e occupied Vienna and the Emperor ordered to surrender. Following the defeat of Austria by Napoleonic forces at the Battle of Wagram in 1809, the fortifications were demolished using explosives, as stipulated in the Peace of Sch\u00f6nbrunn of the same year. The belltower (Glockenturm) and the civic clock tower (Uhrturm), which is a leading tourist attraction and serves as a symbol for Graz, were spared after the citizens of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation.Archduke Karl II of Inner Austria had 20,000 Protestant books burned in the square of what is now a mental hospital, and succeeded in returning Styria to the authority of the Holy See. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was born in Graz in what is now the Stadtmuseum (city museum).\n\n\n== Population development ==\nThe more recent population figures do not give the whole picture as only people with principal-residence status are counted and people with secondary residence status are not. Most of the people with secondary residence status in Graz are students. At the end of 2016 there were 33,473 people with secondary residence status in Graz.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nOceanic climate is the type found in the city, but due to the 0 \u00b0C isotherm, the same occurs in a humid continental climate with based in K\u00f6ppen system (Cfb/Dfb borderline). Wladimir K\u00f6ppen himself was in town and conducted studies to see how the climate of the past influenced the Continental Drift theory. Due to its position southeast of the Alps, Graz is shielded from the prevailing westerly winds that bring weather fronts in from the North Atlantic to northwestern and central Europe. The weather in Graz is thus influenced by the Mediterranean, and it has more hours of sunshine per year than Vienna or Salzburg and also less wind or rain. Graz lies in a basin that is only open to the south, causing the climate to be warmer than would be expected at that latitude. Plants are found in Graz that normally grow much further south.\n\naverage temperatures: Graz Airport 8.7 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) / Karl-Franzens University 9.4 \u00b0C (49 \u00b0F)\naverage rainfall: 818 mm (32 in) with on average 92 days of rain (Karl Franzens University)\naverage hours of sunshine: 1,989 (Karl Franzens University)\n\n\n== Slovenes and Graz ==\nPolitically, culturally, scientifically and religiously, Graz was an important centre for all Slovenes, especially from the establishment of the University of Graz in 1586 until the establishment of University of Ljubljana in 1919. In 1574, the first Slovene Catholic book was published in Graz, and in 1592, Hieronymus Megiser published in Graz the book Dictionarium quatuor linguarum, the first multilingual dictionary of Slovene.The Styrian Slovenes did not consider Graz a German-speaking city, but their own, a place to study while living at their relatives' homes and to fulfill one's career ambitions. The student associations in Graz were a crucible of the Slovene identity, and the Slovene students in Graz were more nationally aware than some others. This led to fierce anti-Slovene efforts of German-speaking nationalists in Graz before and during World War II.Many Slovenian Styrians study there. Slovenes are among the professors at the Institute for Jazz in Graz. Numerous Slovenes have found employment there, while being formerly unemployed in Slovenia. For the Slovene culture, Graz remains permanently important due to its university and the Universalmuseum Joanneum archives containing numerous documents from the Slovenian Styria.A symposium on the relation of Graz and the Slovenes was held in Graz in 2010, at the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the first and oldest chair of Slovene. It was established at the Lyzeum of Graz in July 1811 on the initiative of Janez Nepomuk Primic. A collection of lectures on the topic was published. The Slovenian Post commemorated the anniversary with a stamp.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nFor the year that Graz was Cultural Capital of Europe, new structures were erected. The Graz Museum of Contemporary Art (German: Kunsthaus) was designed by Peter Cook and Colin Fournier and is situated next to the Mur river. The Island in the Mur is a floating platform made of steel. It was designed by American architect Vito Acconci and contains a caf\u00e9, an open-air theatre and a playground.\n\n\n=== Historic city centre ===\n\nThe historic centre was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999 due to the harmonious co-existence of typical buildings from different epochs and in different architectural styles. Situated in a cultural borderland between Central Europe, Italy and the Balkan States, Graz absorbed various influences from the neighbouring regions and thus received its exceptional townscape. Today the historic centre consists of over 1,000 buildings, their age ranging from Gothic to contemporary.\nThe most important sights in the historic centre are:\n\nTown Hall (Rathaus).\nThe Castle hill (German: Schlossberg), a hill dominating the historic centre (475 m (1,558.40 ft) high), site of a demolished fortress, with views over Graz.\nThe Clock Tower (Uhrturm) is a symbol of Graz, at the top of the Castle hill.\nThe New Gallery (Neue Galerie), a museum of art.\nThe Castle hill funicular (Schlossbergbahn), a funicular railway on the Castle hill's slope.\nThe seat of Styria's provincial parliament (Landhaus), a palace in Lombardic style.

It is the 2nd largest opera house in Austria.\nThe Graz Theatre (Schauspielhaus), Graz's principal theatre for productions of plays.\nThe Cathedral (Dom), a rare monument of Gothic architecture. Once, there were many frescos on the outer walls; today, only a few remain, like the Landplagenbild (\"picture of plagues\") painted in 1485, presumably by Thomas von Villach. The three plagues it depicts are locusts, pestilence and the invasion of the Turks, all of them striking the town in 1480. It features the oldest painted view of Graz.\nThe mausoleum of Emperor Ferdinand II next to the cathedral, the most important building of Mannerism in Graz. It includes both the grave where Ferdinand II and his wife are buried, and a church dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria.\nThe Castle (Burg), with Gothic double staircase, built between 1438 and 1453 by Emperor Frederick III, because the old castle on the Schlossberg hill was too small and uncomfortable. The castle remained the residence of the Inner Austrian Court until 1619. Today, it serves as residence for the Styrian government.\nThe Painted House (Gemaltes Haus) in Herrengasse 3. It is completely covered with frescos (painted in 1742 by Johann Mayer).\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art Graz (Kunsthaus)\nThe Island in the Mur (Murinsel), an artificial island in the Mur river.\nBuildings, inner courtyards (e. g.

In the outer districts buildings are predominantly of the architectural styles from the second half of the 20th century.\nIn 1965 the Grazer Schule (School of Graz) was founded. Several buildings around the universities are of this style, for example the green houses by Volker Giencke and the RESOWI center by G\u00fcnther Domenig.\nBefore Graz became the European Capital of Culture in 2003, several new projects were realized, such as the Stadthalle, the Kindermuseum (museum for children), the Helmut-List-Halle, the Kunsthaus and the Murinsel.\n\nTallest buildings\nBuildings in Graz which are at least 50m tall: \n\n\n=== Sports ===\nSK Sturm Graz is the main football club of the city, with three Austrian championships and five runner-up seasons. The Grazer AK also won an Austrian championship, but went into administration in 2007 and was excluded from the professional league system.\nIn ice hockey, the ATSE Graz was the Austrian Hockey League champion in 1975 and 1978.

It's still facing referendum, meaning usually the end for many former olympic bids in Europe and North America since 1970 -century.\n\n\n=== Styriarte ===\nGraz hosts the annual festival of classical music Styriarte, founded in 1985 to tie conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt closer to his hometown. Events have been held at different venues in Graz and in the surrounding region.\n\n\n=== Dialect ===\nReferred to as Steirisch by locals, Graz belongs to the Austro-Bavarian region of dialects, more specifically a mix of Central Bavarian in the western part of Styria and Southern Bavarian in the eastern part. The Grazer ORF, the Graz subsidiary of Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, launched an initiative in 2008 called Scho wieda Steirisch g'redt in order to highlight the numerous dialects of Graz and Styria in general and to cultivate the pride many Styrians hold for their local culture. Two reasons for a melding of these dialects with Standard German: the influence of television and radio bringing Standard German into the home and the industrialization causing the disappearance of the single farmer since the farming communities are seen as the true keepers of dialect speaking.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nAn extensive public transport network makes Graz an easy city to navigate without a car. The city has a comprehensive bus network, complementing the Graz tram network consisting of eight lines. Four lines pass through the underground tram stop at the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof) and on to the city centre before branching out. Furthermore, there are seven night-time bus routes, although these run only at weekends and on evenings preceding public holidays.\nThe Schlossbergbahn, a funicular railway, and the Schlossberg lift, a vertical lift, link the city centre to the Schlossberg.\nFrom the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), regional trains link to most of Styria. Direct trains run to most major cities nearby including Vienna, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Maribor and Ljubljana in Slovenia, Zagreb in Croatia, Budapest in Hungary, Prague and Brno in the Czech Republic, Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland, as well as Munich, Stuttgart, Heidelberg, and Frankfurt in Germany. Trains for Vienna leave every hour. In recent years many railway stations within the city limits and in the suburbs have been rebuilt or modernised and are now part of the \"S-Bahn Graz\", a commuter train service connecting the city with its suburban area and towns nearby.\nGraz airport is located about 10 km (6 mi) south of the city centre and is accessible by bus, railway, and car. Direct destinations include Amsterdam, Berlin, D\u00fcsseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart, Istanbul, Vienna and Zurich.\n\n\n== Health ==\nIn Graz there are seven hospitals, several private hospitals and sanatoriums, as well as 44 pharmacies.\nThe University Hospital Graz (LKH-Universit\u00e4ts-Klinikum Graz) is located in eastern Graz and has 1,556 beds and 7,190 employees. The Regional Hospital Graz II (LKH Graz II) has two sites in Graz.

Furthermore, several non-emergency ambulances (KTW \u2013 Krankentransportwagen) and a Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) are operated by the Red Cross to transport non-emergency patients to and between hospitals. In addition to the Red Cross, the Labourers'-Samaritan-Alliance (Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund \u00d6sterreichs), the Austrian organisation of the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps (Malteser Hospitaldienst Austria) and the Green Cross (Gr\u00fcnes Kreuz) operate ambulances (KTW) for non-emergency patient transport. In addition to the cars, there's also the C12 air ambulance helicopter stationed at Graz airport, staffed with an emergency physician in addition to regular personnel.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nGraz is twinned with:\n\nOther forms of cooperation and city friendship similar to the twin city programmes\n Ni\u0161, Serbia\n Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nThe following are past and present notable residents of Graz.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Austria portal\nList of World Heritage Sites in Austria\nKastner & \u00d6hler\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"Graz: Stadtplanung und Stadtentwicklung (Rechnungshofbericht, 2006) in German\" (PDF). 2006.

          "We did a lovely circular walk in Graz and saw the main sights - the Landeszeughaus armoury, the Kunsthaus Graz and this impressive mausoleum.",
          "This is a gorgeous building which is the mausoleum of Emperor Ferdinand. This building is really beautiful.",
          "The burial-place of Emperor Ferdinand II is a combination of mausoleum (the cupola at the right side) and a church named Katharinenkirche. Wery beautiful. It is monumental sacral and representative building from the 17th century. The mausoleum is the impressive tomb of Emperor",
          "From outside it is not so bad, but inside it is nothing. Most probably for historiciens and for Austrians is interesting.",
          "Definitely mausoleum looks much more prestigious from outside than inside, but I still find it worth visiting. Simple white walls allow to pay a special attention to the beautiful baroque parts of interior - especially amazing ceiling's paintings. I also loved the idea of",
          "It is actually a small church as well as a mausoleum. The church has 2 impressive altars. Then you go down into the crypt. It does not take a long time but is well worth a visit. Do not forget to go up in the tower and do not get scared when the bells start ringing! The eur6",
          "great architecture but boring inside. don't waste your time or money going in. just admire it from outside.",
          "This is an amazing baroque chapel which is beautiful. The tombs are on the lower floor. While we visited a film crew were there making a film about the Counter Reformation. We climbed up the tower and got wonderful views of the city and the Dom next door. A must see place",
          "I was surprised at the number of 4 and 5 Point reviews and decided to look myself. Alas, the style is to be seen in dozens of buildings in Graz alone. The fact that an Emperor is buried there does not make in more interesting nor more aesthetically pleasing. Save your money!",
          "If you were expecting to see a sarcophagus with a figure of Emperor Ferdinand II on top, you will be sadly disappointed. His tomb and that of his first wife are marked only by stone plaques. There is a sarcophagus in the mausoleum, built for the Emperor's parents and several",
          "6\u20ac/person without any kind of information or explanation. The personal was not too kind. From the top of the tower you can't see the city as I expected. The view is worse than from the hill.",
          "I came here because I'd been to the imperial mausoleum in Vienna last year and wanted to complete the set of Austrian royal tombs. The mausoleum is surprisingly large for just one Emperor, with plenty of ornate shrines upstairs and the tomb downstairs. You can climb the bell",
          "There was no guided tour when we were there, but it was beautiful. Much more than I expected to see in a Mausoleum. Make sure to hang on to the handrail going down the steps. Don't forget to look up. Everything is decorated.",
          "Impressive buildiln looks like a church from the outside. Nice to visit but it is just another beutiful old building - not rely outstanding...",
          "We went there 3 times, finally could go into. The open time is pretty limited. The garden outside is quite pretty.",
          "The entrance is quite cheap and the inside is beautiful, full of frescos and ancient decorations. There is a tomb in the lower level that looks fascinating.",
          "There are certain places in Graz one must visit in order to claim they truly were in Graz. The Clock Tower is one such place, as well as Jakominiplatz, the Glockenspeil and of course the Mausoleum of Ferdinand II. Graz is a great town to stroll through. While most businesses are",
          "It was not open the day of our visit (I assume because of the fest taking place in the city) we were very much impressed with the outside architecture. I am sure the interior is equally impressive.",
          "Slightly pricey if you're not a student, but it is a unique place and is interesting inside. A good piece of Austrian culture, more interesting if you know the relevance! You can also go up the tower which has a great view and feels Notre-Dame-esque.",
          "They say it's meant to one of the most beautiful mausoleums artistically in the world, and I can see why. Upstairs were two chapels with amazing marble altar pieces, although I'm not sure if there's actually room for a priest to say mass. It is topped by a beautiful dome filled",
          "The building is great, beautiful and nicely decorated. You can see the sarcophagus of the emperor and his wife. The interior is lovely. You can also climb up the tower and enjoy the view of Graz. The fee for one adult is 6 \u20ac which is too much for what it has to offer. Yet if you",
          "Hadn't expected this to be quite such a big mausoleum. Loved the space, the light, the marble, the domes. Also loved the painted marble....not sure what the name for this art style is, but very effective.",
          "For two adults and two children we paid 16 euro. Once inside there was very little to see compared to the cathedral next door, which was free! The marble alters were made of painted wood and not real marble, the crypt is only viewed from a distance, and the walk to the roof is",
          "If you go to Graz that's one place to visit!! The Mausoleum is very beautiful, the ceiling is all painted. There's also a tower that you can go to the top and have a view from the city. It's a shame all the information is only in German, and they sell some small brochures in",
          "When we walked in the young woman who was selling the tickets looked annoyed that I asked questions. She charged us full price (my mom is a senior citizen). There's no information in English. When I asked about the information the ticket woman rolled her eyes and told me to buy",
          "We walked to the Masoleum and beautiful church attached. The cript is worth the stairs down, the view is worth the trip to the top. Very ornate and beautiful inside- don't miss the church.",
          "Don't let the entrance fee keep you away to visit this jewel of Graz. You won't regret the fantastic paintings in the church, the Mausoleum itself or the view from the clocktower. This is one of my personal highlights in Graz!",
          "This splendid building, which would not be out of place in Rome, adds much to the rather Italian atmosphere of Graz. There is not a great deal to see inside but the tower is worth climbing.",
          "Very impressive! Such beautiful architecture, statues, paintings. You also must climb the bell tower to see amazing city views. See and hear the bells ring. Little deafening but worth the experience.",
          "Part of every standard tour of the historical old town, nice Baroque mausoleum. Try it on a gray and freezing cold winter day, then go somewhere warm and bright and have a hot drink to raise your spirits.",
          "Paid 4 euros each to see 2 monuments and a tomb! Better value elsewhere. no english descriptions either.",
          "Make sure you climb the bell tower for a great city view! The mausoleum Is in great condition. The people of Austria have done a great job in the upkeep of this historic spot.",
          "This is an imprssive building next to Graz Cathederal. We visited during Easter and it was closed unfortunately. Will visit again."

        "wiki": "Graz ( GRAHTS, German: [\u0261\u0281a\u02d0ts] (listen); Slovene: Gradec) is the capital city of Styria and Austria's second-largest city after Vienna. As of 1 January 2019, Graz had a population of 328,276 (292,269 of whom had principal-residence status). In 2015, the population of the Graz larger urban zone (LUZ) stood at 633,168, based on principal-residence status. Graz has a long tradition as a seat of higher education. It has four colleges and four universities with more than 60,000 students. Its historic centre  (Altstadt) is one of the best-preserved city centres in Central Europe.For centuries, Graz was more important to Slovenes and Croats, both politically and culturally, than the capitals of Ljubljana, Slovenia and Zagreb, Croatia; it remains influential to this day. In 1999, the city's historic centre was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites and in 2010 the designation was expanded to include Eggenberg Palace (German: Schloss Eggenberg) on the western edge of the city. Graz was designated the Cultural Capital of Europe in 2003 and became a City of Culinary Delights in 2008.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name of the city, Graz, formerly spelled Gratz, most likely stems from the Slavic gradec, which means \"small castle\". Some archaeological finds point to the erection of a small castle by Alpine Slavic people, which over time became a heavily defended fortification. In literary Slovene and Croatian, gradec still means \"small castle\", forming a hypocoristic derivative of Proto-West-South Slavic *grad\u044cc\u044a, whichs descends via liquid metathesis from Common Slavic *gard\u044cc\u044a and via the Slavic third palatalisation from Proto-Slavic *gardiku, originally denoting \"small town, settlement\". The name thus follows the common South Slavic pattern for naming settlements as grad. The German name 'Graz' first appears in records in 1128.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGraz is situated on both sides of the Mur river in southeast Austria. It is about 200 km (120 mi) southwest of Vienna (Wien). The nearest larger urban centre is Maribor (Marburg) in Slovenia, which is about 50 km (31 mi) to the south. Graz is the state capital and largest city in Styria, a green and heavily forested region on the eastern edge of the Alps.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring municipalities ===\nThese towns and villages border Graz:\n\nto the north: Gratkorn, Stattegg, Weinitzen\nto the east: Kainbach bei Graz, Hart bei Graz, Raaba\nto the south: G\u00f6ssendorf, Feldkirchen bei Graz, Seiersberg\nto the west: Attendorf, Thal, Judendorf-Stra\u00dfengel\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nGraz is divided into 17 municipal districts (Stadtbezirke):\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement on the ground of the modern city of Graz dates back to the Copper Age. However, no historical continuity exists of a settlement before the Middle Ages.\nDuring the 12th century, dukes under Babenberg rule made the town into an important commercial center. Later, Graz came under the rule of the Habsburgs and, in 1281, gained special privileges from King Rudolph I.\nIn the 14th century, Graz became the city of residence of the Inner Austrian line of the Habsburgs. The royalty lived in the Schlossberg castle and from there ruled Styria, Carinthia, most of today's Slovenia, and parts of Italy (Carniola, Gorizia and Gradisca, Trieste).\nIn the 16th century, the city's design and planning were primarily controlled by Italian Renaissance architects and artists. One of the most famous buildings representative of this style is the Landhaus, designed by Domenico dell'Allio, and used by the local rulers as a governmental headquarters.\n\nThe University of Graz was founded by Archduke Karl II in 1585, it's the city's oldest university. For most of its existence, it was controlled by the Catholic church, and was closed in 1782 by Joseph II in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a lyceum where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-established as a university by Emperor Franz I, and was named 'Karl-Franzens Universit\u00e4t' or 'Charles-Francis University' in English. More than 30,000 students are currently enrolled at this university.\nThe astronomer Johannes Kepler lived in Graz for a short period. He worked as a math teacher and was a professor of mathematics at the University of Graz, but still found time to study astronomy. He left Graz for Prague when Lutherans were banned from the city.\nLudwig Boltzmann was Professor for Mathematical Physics from 1869 to 1890. During that time, Nikola Tesla studied electrical engineering at the Polytechnic in 1875. Nobel Laureate Otto Loewi taught at the University of Graz from 1909 until 1938. Ivo Andric, the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature Laureate obtained his doctorate at the University of Graz. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger was briefly chancellor of the University of Graz in 1936.\nGraz is centrally located within today's Bundesland (state) of Styria, or Steiermark in German. Mark is an old German word indicating a large area of land used as a defensive border, in which the peasantry is taught how to organize and fight in the case of an invasion. With a strategic location at the head of the open and fertile Mur valley, Graz was historically a target of invaders, such as the Hungarians under Matthias Corvinus in 1481, and the Ottoman Turks in 1529 and 1532. Apart from the Riegersburg Castle, the Schlossberg was the only fortification in the region that never fell to the Ottoman Turks. Graz is home to the region's provincial armory, which is the world's largest historical collection of late medieval and Renaissance weaponry. It has been preserved since 1551, and displays over 30,000 items.\nFrom the earlier part of the 15th century, Graz was the residence of the younger branch of the Habsburgs, which succeeded to the imperial throne in 1619 in the person of Emperor Ferdinand II, who moved the capital to Vienna. New fortifications were built on the Schlossberg at the end of the 16th century. Napoleon's army occupied Graz in 1797. In 1809, the city withstood another assault by the French army. During this attack, the commanding officer in the fortress was ordered to defend it with about 900 men against Napoleon's army of about 3,000. He successfully defended the Schlossberg against eight attacks, but they were forced to give up after the Grande Arm\u00e9e occupied Vienna and the Emperor ordered to surrender. Following the defeat of Austria by Napoleonic forces at the Battle of Wagram in 1809, the fortifications were demolished using explosives, as stipulated in the Peace of Sch\u00f6nbrunn of the same year. The belltower (Glockenturm) and the civic clock tower (Uhrturm), which is a leading tourist attraction and serves as a symbol for Graz, were spared after the citizens of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation.Archduke Karl II of Inner Austria had 20,000 Protestant books burned in the square of what is now a mental hospital, and succeeded in returning Styria to the authority of the Holy See. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was born in Graz in what is now the Stadtmuseum (city museum).\n\n\n== Population development ==\nThe more recent population figures do not give the whole picture as only people with principal-residence status are counted and people with secondary residence status are not. Most of the people with secondary residence status in Graz are students. At the end of 2016 there were 33,473 people with secondary residence status in Graz.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nOceanic climate is the type found in the city, but due to the 0 \u00b0C isotherm, the same occurs in a humid continental climate with based in K\u00f6ppen system (Cfb/Dfb borderline). Wladimir K\u00f6ppen himself was in town and conducted studies to see how the climate of the past influenced the Continental Drift theory. Due to its position southeast of the Alps, Graz is shielded from the prevailing westerly winds that bring weather fronts in from the North Atlantic to northwestern and central Europe. The weather in Graz is thus influenced by the Mediterranean, and it has more hours of sunshine per year than Vienna or Salzburg and also less wind or rain. Graz lies in a basin that is only open to the south, causing the climate to be warmer than would be expected at that latitude. Plants are found in Graz that normally grow much further south.\n\naverage temperatures: Graz Airport 8.7 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) / Karl-Franzens University 9.4 \u00b0C (49 \u00b0F)\naverage rainfall: 818 mm (32 in) with on average 92 days of rain (Karl Franzens University)\naverage hours of sunshine: 1,989 (Karl Franzens University)\n\n\n== Slovenes and Graz ==\nPolitically, culturally, scientifically and religiously, Graz was an important centre for all Slovenes, especially from the establishment of the University of Graz in 1586 until the establishment of University of Ljubljana in 1919. In 1574, the first Slovene Catholic book was published in Graz, and in 1592, Hieronymus Megiser published in Graz the book Dictionarium quatuor linguarum, the first multilingual dictionary of Slovene.The Styrian Slovenes did not consider Graz a German-speaking city, but their own, a place to study while living at their relatives' homes and to fulfill one's career ambitions. The student associations in Graz were a crucible of the Slovene identity, and the Slovene students in Graz were more nationally aware than some others. This led to fierce anti-Slovene efforts of German-speaking nationalists in Graz before and during World War II.Many Slovenian Styrians study there. Slovenes are among the professors at the Institute for Jazz in Graz. Numerous Slovenes have found employment there, while being formerly unemployed in Slovenia. For the Slovene culture, Graz remains permanently important due to its university and the Universalmuseum Joanneum archives containing numerous documents from the Slovenian Styria.A symposium on the relation of Graz and the Slovenes was held in Graz in 2010, at the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the first and oldest chair of Slovene. It was established at the Lyzeum of Graz in July 1811 on the initiative of Janez Nepomuk Primic. A collection of lectures on the topic was published. The Slovenian Post commemorated the anniversary with a stamp.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nFor the year that Graz was Cultural Capital of Europe, new structures were erected. The Graz Museum of Contemporary Art (German: Kunsthaus) was designed by Peter Cook and Colin Fournier and is situated next to the Mur river. The Island in the Mur is a floating platform made of steel. It was designed by American architect Vito Acconci and contains a caf\u00e9, an open-air theatre and a playground.\n\n\n=== Historic city centre ===\n\nThe historic centre was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999 due to the harmonious co-existence of typical buildings from different epochs and in different architectural styles. Situated in a cultural borderland between Central Europe, Italy and the Balkan States, Graz absorbed various influences from the neighbouring regions and thus received its exceptional townscape. Today the historic centre consists of over 1,000 buildings, their age ranging from Gothic to contemporary.\nThe most important sights in the historic centre are:\n\nTown Hall (Rathaus).\nThe Castle hill (German: Schlossberg), a hill dominating the historic centre (475 m (1,558.40 ft) high), site of a demolished fortress, with views over Graz.\nThe Clock Tower (Uhrturm) is a symbol of Graz, at the top of the Castle hill.\nThe New Gallery (Neue Galerie), a museum of art.\nThe Castle hill funicular (Schlossbergbahn), a funicular railway on the Castle hill's slope.\nThe seat of Styria's provincial parliament (Landhaus), a palace in Lombardic style. It is one of the most important examples of Renaissance architecture in Austria and was built by Italian architect Domenico dell'Allio between 1557 and 1565.\nThe Armoury (Landeszeughaus) is the largest of its kind in the world.\nThe Graz Opera House (Opernhaus), the principal venue for opera, ballet, and operetta performances. It is the 2nd largest opera house in Austria.\nThe Graz Theatre (Schauspielhaus), Graz's principal theatre for productions of plays.\nThe Cathedral (Dom), a rare monument of Gothic architecture. Once, there were many frescos on the outer walls; today, only a few remain, like the Landplagenbild (\"picture of plagues\") painted in 1485, presumably by Thomas von Villach. The three plagues it depicts are locusts, pestilence and the invasion of the Turks, all of them striking the town in 1480. It features the oldest painted view of Graz.\nThe mausoleum of Emperor Ferdinand II next to the cathedral, the most important building of Mannerism in Graz. It includes both the grave where Ferdinand II and his wife are buried, and a church dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria.\nThe Castle (Burg), with Gothic double staircase, built between 1438 and 1453 by Emperor Frederick III, because the old castle on the Schlossberg hill was too small and uncomfortable. The castle remained the residence of the Inner Austrian Court until 1619. Today, it serves as residence for the Styrian government.\nThe Painted House (Gemaltes Haus) in Herrengasse 3. It is completely covered with frescos (painted in 1742 by Johann Mayer).\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art Graz (Kunsthaus)\nThe Island in the Mur (Murinsel), an artificial island in the Mur river.\nBuildings, inner courtyards (e. g. Early Renaissance courtyard of the Former House of Teutonic Knights in Sporgasse 22) and roofscape of the old town.\n\n\n=== Outside the historic city centre ===\n\nEggenberg Palace (Schloss Eggenberg) a baroque palace on the western edge of Graz with State rooms and museum. In 2010 it was added to the existing World Heritage site of the historic centre of Graz.\nThe Mariatrost Basilica (Basilika Mariatrost) a late Baroque church, on the eastern edge of Graz.\nThe Jesus's Heart Church (Herz-Jesu-Kirche) is the largest church in Graz with the third highest spire in Austria, built in Gothic Revival style.\nThe Calvary Hill (Kalvarienberg) in the G\u00f6sting area of Graz with a 17th-century calvary and church.\nThe Graz University Hospital is the largest hospital in Graz and one of the largest hospitals in Austria.

In the outer districts buildings are predominantly of the architectural styles from the second half of the 20th century.\nIn 1965 the Grazer Schule (School of Graz) was founded. Several buildings around the universities are of this style, for example the green houses by Volker Giencke and the RESOWI center by G\u00fcnther Domenig.\nBefore Graz became the European Capital of Culture in 2003, several new projects were realized, such as the Stadthalle, the Kindermuseum (museum for children), the Helmut-List-Halle, the Kunsthaus and the Murinsel.\n\nTallest buildings\nBuildings in Graz which are at least 50m tall: \n\n\n=== Sports ===\nSK Sturm Graz is the main football club of the city, with three Austrian championships and five runner-up seasons.

The Grazer ORF, the Graz subsidiary of Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, launched an initiative in 2008 called Scho wieda Steirisch g'redt in order to highlight the numerous dialects of Graz and Styria in general and to cultivate the pride many Styrians hold for their local culture. Two reasons for a melding of these dialects with Standard German: the influence of television and radio bringing Standard German into the home and the industrialization causing the disappearance of the single farmer since the farming communities are seen as the true keepers of dialect speaking.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nAn extensive public transport network makes Graz an easy city to navigate without a car. The city has a comprehensive bus network, complementing the Graz tram network consisting of eight lines. Four lines pass through the underground tram stop at the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof) and on to the city centre before branching out. Furthermore, there are seven night-time bus routes, although these run only at weekends and on evenings preceding public holidays.\nThe Schlossbergbahn, a funicular railway, and the Schlossberg lift, a vertical lift, link the city centre to the Schlossberg.\nFrom the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), regional trains link to most of Styria. Direct trains run to most major cities nearby including Vienna, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Maribor and Ljubljana in Slovenia, Zagreb in Croatia, Budapest in Hungary, Prague and Brno in the Czech Republic, Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland, as well as Munich, Stuttgart, Heidelberg, and Frankfurt in Germany. Trains for Vienna leave every hour. In recent years many railway stations within the city limits and in the suburbs have been rebuilt or modernised and are now part of the \"S-Bahn Graz\", a commuter train service connecting the city with its suburban area and towns nearby.\nGraz airport is located about 10 km (6 mi) south of the city centre and is accessible by bus, railway, and car. Direct destinations include Amsterdam, Berlin, D\u00fcsseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart, Istanbul, Vienna and Zurich.\n\n\n== Health ==\nIn Graz there are seven hospitals, several private hospitals and sanatoriums, as well as 44 pharmacies.\nThe University Hospital Graz (LKH-Universit\u00e4ts-Klinikum Graz) is located in eastern Graz and has 1,556 beds and 7,190 employees. The Regional Hospital Graz II (LKH Graz II) has two sites in Graz.

        "wiki": "The Attems (Attimis in Italian) are an ancient and illustrious Friulian parliamentary family that held the titles of princes, counts and barons. The family, from the native castle of Attimis, branched off into Italy and Austria in different lineages, each named after different fiefdoms and domains held. It seems certain that the founder of it is Enrico, already Marquis of Tuscany, who in February 1170 was appointed with his brother Arpone among the deacons of the patriarch of Aquileia Woldarico and from this, in the same year, was conferred the castle of Attems or Attimis. The main lines of this family are those of the Attems of the Trident, that branched in the Attems of Cividale (extinct); the Attems of Udine; the Attems of S. Croce; and the Attems Petzenstein, and that of the Attems of the Bear (Extinct).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe probable origins date back to the Counts of Monfort, such sentiment has been displayed by writers such as Wolfgango Lazio, from ancient manuscripts of the library of the princes Landi of the Val di Taro  which contains clear history regarding the most illustrious families of Northern Italy and finally, from the ancient papers of the precious deposit of the archives of the Counts of Attems, which more accurately confirm their origin from the Counts of Monfort. From there it is also possible to discern the family's coat-of-arms of the Trident, typical of the Monfort Dukes of Franconia. Enrico, son of Rodolfo, count of Bregenz and Monfort, participated in the wars of Italy led by Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor. The sons of Rodolfo, Enrico and Arbeno (undoubted descendants of today's Attems of the Trident), were close to the patriarch Vodalrico which was consequently fraternal to the Emperor Frederick both in friendship and in blood.The town of Attimis was born as a village under the castle of the Lords of Attems. The latter was donated initially by the Marquis of Moosburg i.e. the Archbishop of Salzburg Bertoldo of Moosburg to the Church of Aquileia, i.e. the Patriarchate.  It was subsequently conferred to Enrico and Arbeno Attems by the grateful patriarch in recognition of the faithful services provided in the wars with Frederick I. The family had properties and influence among the fiefs of Friuli at the time when the lands were governed by the Patriarchs of Aquileia.\nIt is certain that Attems (Attimis), already in the eleventh century was a marquisate, even before Enrico and Arbeno had received it as a fief by the patriarch Voldarico. We are equally in the dark as to who and what time this title was conferred.Two were the castles of Attimis: the Upper and the Lower one. The former is extremely ancient, it is composed of a tower and two turrets. The lower castle was instead built between 1250 and 1260 and its territory was extremely vast. Between its borders it embraced many villages of the promontory, and spread out in the plains until the vicinity of Udine in that territory Raimondo della Torre knighted Enrico son of Alberto count of Gorizia and other Alemannic barons and lords of Friuli.In 1387 the family was allied, like many others, to the Counts da Camino and to the Princes Da Carrara. The family hired the venture captain Bello di Portogallo and his mercenaries, which, attending compensation for their service, took the Attems\u2019 Lower Castle as guarantee. The 10th of February 1387 these payments were settled and the stronghold returned. That same year, Udine sent to Attimis cannons and different military instruments aimed at the defence of the lower stronghold, which made it amongst the first ones in Italy to possess such weaponry.\n\nMeanwhile, the Upper castle of Attimis fell into ruin, and the same faith overtook the lower one not much after (1484) due to widespread utilisation of bombard cannons.  In light of such the Attems built at the base of the hill a fortified manor which the Italian branch of the family resided in until 1944 when it was burnt down by the Nazifascist regime.After the conquest of Friuli by the Republic of Venice and the incorporation into the Domini di Terraferma by 1433, a part of the family remained in Attimis while Frederick of Attems (1447\u20131521) moved to Gorizia (G\u00f6rz), where in 1473 he became chancellor to the last Count Leonhard. When the latters comital line became extinct in 1500, he was confirmed in that office (Count) by the Habsburg emperor Maximilian I and in 1506 even was appointed governor of the Gorizia on behalf of the Inner Austrian archdukes.\nFrederick's heirs split into the cadet branches of Heiligenkreuz and Petzenstein. Since then, the Attems family played an important role in the Habsburg Monarchy; both lines were elevated to the rank of Freiherren (Barons) in 1605 and given the title of Reichsgrafen (Counts of the Holy Roman Empire) in 1630 (Heiligenkreuz) and 1653 (Petzenstein).\nNotable member was Karl Michael von Attems, born in Gorizia on the first of July 1711, was a canon in the Cathedral of Basilea, apostolic vicariate for the area of the empire belonging to the Patriarchate of Aquileia. On 24 August 1750 he was sacredly nominated Bishop of Pergamo. On 24 April 1752 he was nominated first archbishop of the new Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gorizia. In 1766 he was nominated Prince of the Holy Roman Empire.In the Baroque period, the House of Attems was the richest and most influential noble family in the Duchy of Styria. In 1702 Count Ignaz Maria ordered the construction of Palais Attems in Graz, which became home of his extensive art collections; it is today part of the Graz Historic Centre World Heritage Site. In 1861, the heads of the Heiligenkreuz branch were also appointed hereditary members of the Austrian House of Lords.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notable Historic Properties ==\n\nPalace Dvorec \u0160tatenberg: The summer palace of the Counts of Attems.\nIn the countryside of \u0160tajerska we find one of the most beautiful palaces of the Baroque period on Slovenian territory. The palace was constructed at the end of the 17th century and completed around 1740 by Ignazio Maria von Attems, from the branch Attems-Petzenstein. The Palace is found about 15 km south of Slovenska Bistrica, where the family owned a castle in the city centre (then nationalised by the jugoslavian state after the second world war). The palace consists of an Italian baroque-style garden, remarkable stuccoes and frescoes, particularly found in the knight's hall.\nPalace Attems Petzenstein of GoriziaThe Attems Petzenstein Palace, located in the center of the city of Gorizia near Piazza della Vittoria, was built in the first half of the 18th century by the Attems family. The structure built on the basis of a project by architect Nicol\u00f2 Pacassi, characterized by a style of transition between the baroque and the rococ\u00f2, was subjected to neoclassical restructuring in the first half of the nineteenth century, which made the original features of the fa\u00e7ade unrecognizable. The seven statues that surmount it, representing subjects of Olympus, are the work of the Bergamo sculptor Giovanni Battista Mazzoleni. The historical and artistic heritage of this building, as well as being represented by the various stuccos and frescoes dating back to the last part of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, is also enhanced by the canvas depicting \"Gli dei dell'Olimpo\" located on the ceiling of the great internal hall, attributed to the painter Antonio Paroli (1745). Also interesting is the internal Italian-style garden with the fountain of the Hercules in the center. The Pinacoteca of Palazzo Attems Petzenstein counts works by some masters of the eighteenth century Veneto, many nineteenth-century portraits (including some paintings by Giuseppe Tominz) and a collection of works of the twentieth century (among the authors we find Italico Brass, Luigi Spazzapan, Tullio Crali and Vittorio Bolaffio).\nDornava ManorDonava Manor belonged to  the Lords of Ptuj (the Herbersteins and Sauers) in the Middle Ages. In 1730, it was bought by Count Dizma Attems and redesigned as a baroque park and garden. Ptuj is one of the oldest towns in Slovenia and was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire.\nPalace Attems of Graz\nIgnazio Maria von Attems, the founder of the Graz line of the noble family Attems from Friuli-Italy, acquired six town houses between 1687 and 1702, which stood on the site of the present palace. He commissioned the architect Johann Joachim Carlone with the construction of a city palace. Andreas Stengg is presumed to be another involved master builder. The work lasted from 1702 to 1716. The U-shaped, blocky building with four storeys encloses a square courtyard. The Baroque facade is richly decorated with stucco work by Domenico Boscho, both on the street side and in the courtyard. The fa\u00e7ade design was influenced by northern Italian palace buildings. The lower floors have been combined to form a base zone and have windows with rustic stone framing. On the two upper floors, the windows are provided with brow arch suspensions and stuccoed vases. The upper fa\u00e7ade storeys are separated from the lower zone by ionic and composite pilasters, between which a belt cornice runs. In the interior of the palace, the stucco is decorated with gold, silver and copper plating. The ceiling and super portrait pictures contain representations from the Old Testament and an ancient mythological motives. The pieces of the extensive art collection were lost in the postwar period.\n\nPalace Attems of Santa CroceBuilt in 1740 on the design of architect Nicol\u00f2 Pacassi, the building currently houses the headquarters of the Municipality of Gorizia. Of the original configuration of Palazzo Attems there is only the general structure, the internal staircase and its loggia that overlooks the back garden. During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the building was extensively renovated, resulting partially modified both in the distribution structure and in the facade design. The configuration of the staircase body reveals the influence of the Venetian architectural tradition of the seventeenth century. The lower level is characterised by a compact wall, while at the level above it opens a loggia punctuated by Ionic columns. The building is embellished in the rear part of a garden, from the original eighteenth-century plant, then modified in the nineteenth century, currently considerably smaller than the original extension.\nVilla Attems Cernozza de PostcastroThe property Villa Attems Cernozza  de Postcastro is documented at the end of the 15th century as owned by the ancient noble family from Gorizia \u201cdei Postcastro\u201d. The property was inherited by the family \u201cdai Cernozza\u201d. The Baroness Beninia Cernozza de Postcastro will marry Massimiliano Attems in 1649 making the property patrimony of the Attems family.\n\n\n== Notable members ==\nNotable individuals from the Attems family include the following:\n\nAnton Attems (1834\u20131891), an Austrian baron and politician\nErmest Amadeus Thomas Attems (1694\u20131757), bishop of Ljubljana\nFerdinand von Attems (1746\u20131820), Count Governor of Styria, Baron of Sveti Kri\u017e (Heiligenkreuz/Santa Croce)\nIgnatius Maria Attems (1774\u20131861), Governor of Styria, Baron of Sveti Kri\u017e\nJoseph Oswald von Attems (1679\u20131744), Bishop of Lavant\nKarl Michael von Attems (1707\u20131774), Archbishop of Gorizia and Prince of the Holy Roman Empire\nOttokar Maria von Attems (1815\u20131867), Bishop of Seckau\n\n\n== Books ==\nThe Attems family lineage can be found in several books:\n\nAnnuaro della Nobilit\u00e0 Italiana\nThe Austrian State Archives\nDeutsches Adelslexikon\nGenealogisches Handbuch des Adels GHdA\n\n\n== External links ==\nGenealogy of the Attems on GENEALOGY.EU \u2192 [1], [2], [3], [4] u.

        "wiki": "Graz ( GRAHTS, German: [\u0261\u0281a\u02d0ts] (listen); Slovene: Gradec) is the capital city of Styria and Austria's second-largest city after Vienna. As of 1 January 2019, Graz had a population of 328,276 (292,269 of whom had principal-residence status). In 2015, the population of the Graz larger urban zone (LUZ) stood at 633,168, based on principal-residence status. Graz has a long tradition as a seat of higher education. It has four colleges and four universities with more than 60,000 students. Its historic centre  (Altstadt) is one of the best-preserved city centres in Central Europe.For centuries, Graz was more important to Slovenes and Croats, both politically and culturally, than the capitals of Ljubljana, Slovenia and Zagreb, Croatia; it remains influential to this day. In 1999, the city's historic centre was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites and in 2010 the designation was expanded to include Eggenberg Palace (German: Schloss Eggenberg) on the western edge of the city. Graz was designated the Cultural Capital of Europe in 2003 and became a City of Culinary Delights in 2008.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name of the city, Graz, formerly spelled Gratz, most likely stems from the Slavic gradec, which means \"small castle\". Some archaeological finds point to the erection of a small castle by Alpine Slavic people, which over time became a heavily defended fortification. In literary Slovene and Croatian, gradec still means \"small castle\", forming a hypocoristic derivative of Proto-West-South Slavic *grad\u044cc\u044a, whichs descends via liquid metathesis from Common Slavic *gard\u044cc\u044a and via the Slavic third palatalisation from Proto-Slavic *gardiku, originally denoting \"small town, settlement\". The name thus follows the common South Slavic pattern for naming settlements as grad. The German name 'Graz' first appears in records in 1128.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGraz is situated on both sides of the Mur river in southeast Austria. It is about 200 km (120 mi) southwest of Vienna (Wien). The nearest larger urban centre is Maribor (Marburg) in Slovenia, which is about 50 km (31 mi) to the south. Graz is the state capital and largest city in Styria, a green and heavily forested region on the eastern edge of the Alps.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring municipalities ===\nThese towns and villages border Graz:\n\nto the north: Gratkorn, Stattegg, Weinitzen\nto the east: Kainbach bei Graz, Hart bei Graz, Raaba\nto the south: G\u00f6ssendorf, Feldkirchen bei Graz, Seiersberg\nto the west: Attendorf, Thal, Judendorf-Stra\u00dfengel\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nGraz is divided into 17 municipal districts (Stadtbezirke):\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement on the ground of the modern city of Graz dates back to the Copper Age. However, no historical continuity exists of a settlement before the Middle Ages.\nDuring the 12th century, dukes under Babenberg rule made the town into an important commercial center. Later, Graz came under the rule of the Habsburgs and, in 1281, gained special privileges from King Rudolph I.\nIn the 14th century, Graz became the city of residence of the Inner Austrian line of the Habsburgs. The royalty lived in the Schlossberg castle and from there ruled Styria, Carinthia, most of today's Slovenia, and parts of Italy (Carniola, Gorizia and Gradisca, Trieste).\nIn the 16th century, the city's design and planning were primarily controlled by Italian Renaissance architects and artists. One of the most famous buildings representative of this style is the Landhaus, designed by Domenico dell'Allio, and used by the local rulers as a governmental headquarters.\n\nThe University of Graz was founded by Archduke Karl II in 1585, it's the city's oldest university. For most of its existence, it was controlled by the Catholic church, and was closed in 1782 by Joseph II in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a lyceum where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-established as a university by Emperor Franz I, and was named 'Karl-Franzens Universit\u00e4t' or 'Charles-Francis University' in English. More than 30,000 students are currently enrolled at this university.\nThe astronomer Johannes Kepler lived in Graz for a short period. He worked as a math teacher and was a professor of mathematics at the University of Graz, but still found time to study astronomy. He left Graz for Prague when Lutherans were banned from the city.\nLudwig Boltzmann was Professor for Mathematical Physics from 1869 to 1890. During that time, Nikola Tesla studied electrical engineering at the Polytechnic in 1875. Nobel Laureate Otto Loewi taught at the University of Graz from 1909 until 1938. Ivo Andric, the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature Laureate obtained his doctorate at the University of Graz. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger was briefly chancellor of the University of Graz in 1936.\nGraz is centrally located within today's Bundesland (state) of Styria, or Steiermark in German. Mark is an old German word indicating a large area of land used as a defensive border, in which the peasantry is taught how to organize and fight in the case of an invasion. With a strategic location at the head of the open and fertile Mur valley, Graz was historically a target of invaders, such as the Hungarians under Matthias Corvinus in 1481, and the Ottoman Turks in 1529 and 1532. Apart from the Riegersburg Castle, the Schlossberg was the only fortification in the region that never fell to the Ottoman Turks. Graz is home to the region's provincial armory, which is the world's largest historical collection of late medieval and Renaissance weaponry. It has been preserved since 1551, and displays over 30,000 items.\nFrom the earlier part of the 15th century, Graz was the residence of the younger branch of the Habsburgs, which succeeded to the imperial throne in 1619 in the person of Emperor Ferdinand II, who moved the capital to Vienna. New fortifications were built on the Schlossberg at the end of the 16th century. Napoleon's army occupied Graz in 1797. In 1809, the city withstood another assault by the French army. During this attack, the commanding officer in the fortress was ordered to defend it with about 900 men against Napoleon's army of about 3,000. He successfully defended the Schlossberg against eight attacks, but they were forced to give up after the Grande Arm\u00e9e occupied Vienna and the Emperor ordered to surrender. Following the defeat of Austria by Napoleonic forces at the Battle of Wagram in 1809, the fortifications were demolished using explosives, as stipulated in the Peace of Sch\u00f6nbrunn of the same year. The belltower (Glockenturm) and the civic clock tower (Uhrturm), which is a leading tourist attraction and serves as a symbol for Graz, were spared after the citizens of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation.Archduke Karl II of Inner Austria had 20,000 Protestant books burned in the square of what is now a mental hospital, and succeeded in returning Styria to the authority of the Holy See. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was born in Graz in what is now the Stadtmuseum (city museum).\n\n\n== Population development ==\nThe more recent population figures do not give the whole picture as only people with principal-residence status are counted and people with secondary residence status are not. Most of the people with secondary residence status in Graz are students. At the end of 2016 there were 33,473 people with secondary residence status in Graz.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nOceanic climate is the type found in the city, but due to the 0 \u00b0C isotherm, the same occurs in a humid continental climate with based in K\u00f6ppen system (Cfb/Dfb borderline). Wladimir K\u00f6ppen himself was in town and conducted studies to see how the climate of the past influenced the Continental Drift theory. Due to its position southeast of the Alps, Graz is shielded from the prevailing westerly winds that bring weather fronts in from the North Atlantic to northwestern and central Europe. The weather in Graz is thus influenced by the Mediterranean, and it has more hours of sunshine per year than Vienna or Salzburg and also less wind or rain. Graz lies in a basin that is only open to the south, causing the climate to be warmer than would be expected at that latitude. Plants are found in Graz that normally grow much further south.\n\naverage temperatures: Graz Airport 8.7 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) / Karl-Franzens University 9.4 \u00b0C (49 \u00b0F)\naverage rainfall: 818 mm (32 in) with on average 92 days of rain (Karl Franzens University)\naverage hours of sunshine: 1,989 (Karl Franzens University)\n\n\n== Slovenes and Graz ==\nPolitically, culturally, scientifically and religiously, Graz was an important centre for all Slovenes, especially from the establishment of the University of Graz in 1586 until the establishment of University of Ljubljana in 1919. In 1574, the first Slovene Catholic book was published in Graz, and in 1592, Hieronymus Megiser published in Graz the book Dictionarium quatuor linguarum, the first multilingual dictionary of Slovene.The Styrian Slovenes did not consider Graz a German-speaking city, but their own, a place to study while living at their relatives' homes and to fulfill one's career ambitions. The student associations in Graz were a crucible of the Slovene identity, and the Slovene students in Graz were more nationally aware than some others. This led to fierce anti-Slovene efforts of German-speaking nationalists in Graz before and during World War II.Many Slovenian Styrians study there. Slovenes are among the professors at the Institute for Jazz in Graz. Numerous Slovenes have found employment there, while being formerly unemployed in Slovenia. For the Slovene culture, Graz remains permanently important due to its university and the Universalmuseum Joanneum archives containing numerous documents from the Slovenian Styria.A symposium on the relation of Graz and the Slovenes was held in Graz in 2010, at the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the first and oldest chair of Slovene. It was established at the Lyzeum of Graz in July 1811 on the initiative of Janez Nepomuk Primic. A collection of lectures on the topic was published. The Slovenian Post commemorated the anniversary with a stamp.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nFor the year that Graz was Cultural Capital of Europe, new structures were erected. The Graz Museum of Contemporary Art (German: Kunsthaus) was designed by Peter Cook and Colin Fournier and is situated next to the Mur river. The Island in the Mur is a floating platform made of steel. It was designed by American architect Vito Acconci and contains a caf\u00e9, an open-air theatre and a playground.\n\n\n=== Historic city centre ===\n\nThe historic centre was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999 due to the harmonious co-existence of typical buildings from different epochs and in different architectural styles. Situated in a cultural borderland between Central Europe, Italy and the Balkan States, Graz absorbed various influences from the neighbouring regions and thus received its exceptional townscape. Today the historic centre consists of over 1,000 buildings, their age ranging from Gothic to contemporary.\nThe most important sights in the historic centre are:\n\nTown Hall (Rathaus).\nThe Castle hill (German: Schlossberg), a hill dominating the historic centre (475 m (1,558.40 ft) high), site of a demolished fortress, with views over Graz.\nThe Clock Tower (Uhrturm) is a symbol of Graz, at the top of the Castle hill.\nThe New Gallery (Neue Galerie), a museum of art.\nThe Castle hill funicular (Schlossbergbahn), a funicular railway on the Castle hill's slope.\nThe seat of Styria's provincial parliament (Landhaus), a palace in Lombardic style.

It features the oldest painted view of Graz.\nThe mausoleum of Emperor Ferdinand II next to the cathedral, the most important building of Mannerism in Graz. It includes both the grave where Ferdinand II and his wife are buried, and a church dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria.\nThe Castle (Burg), with Gothic double staircase, built between 1438 and 1453 by Emperor Frederick III, because the old castle on the Schlossberg hill was too small and uncomfortable.

In the outer districts buildings are predominantly of the architectural styles from the second half of the 20th century.\nIn 1965 the Grazer Schule (School of Graz) was founded. Several buildings around the universities are of this style, for example the green houses by Volker Giencke and the RESOWI center by G\u00fcnther Domenig.\nBefore Graz became the European Capital of Culture in 2003, several new projects were realized, such as the Stadthalle, the Kindermuseum (museum for children), the Helmut-List-Halle, the Kunsthaus and the Murinsel.\n\nTallest buildings\nBuildings in Graz which are at least 50m tall: \n\n\n=== Sports ===\nSK Sturm Graz is the main football club of the city, with three Austrian championships and five runner-up seasons.

Events have been held at different venues in Graz and in the surrounding region.\n\n\n=== Dialect ===\nReferred to as Steirisch by locals, Graz belongs to the Austro-Bavarian region of dialects, more specifically a mix of Central Bavarian in the western part of Styria and Southern Bavarian in the eastern part. The Grazer ORF, the Graz subsidiary of Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, launched an initiative in 2008 called Scho wieda Steirisch g'redt in order to highlight the numerous dialects of Graz and Styria in general and to cultivate the pride many Styrians hold for their local culture. Two reasons for a melding of these dialects with Standard German: the influence of television and radio bringing Standard German into the home and the industrialization causing the disappearance of the single farmer since the farming communities are seen as the true keepers of dialect speaking.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nAn extensive public transport network makes Graz an easy city to navigate without a car. The city has a comprehensive bus network, complementing the Graz tram network consisting of eight lines. Four lines pass through the underground tram stop at the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof) and on to the city centre before branching out. Furthermore, there are seven night-time bus routes, although these run only at weekends and on evenings preceding public holidays.\nThe Schlossbergbahn, a funicular railway, and the Schlossberg lift, a vertical lift, link the city centre to the Schlossberg.\nFrom the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), regional trains link to most of Styria. Direct trains run to most major cities nearby including Vienna, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Maribor and Ljubljana in Slovenia, Zagreb in Croatia, Budapest in Hungary, Prague and Brno in the Czech Republic, Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland, as well as Munich, Stuttgart, Heidelberg, and Frankfurt in Germany. Trains for Vienna leave every hour. In recent years many railway stations within the city limits and in the suburbs have been rebuilt or modernised and are now part of the \"S-Bahn Graz\", a commuter train service connecting the city with its suburban area and towns nearby.\nGraz airport is located about 10 km (6 mi) south of the city centre and is accessible by bus, railway, and car. Direct destinations include Amsterdam, Berlin, D\u00fcsseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart, Istanbul, Vienna and Zurich.\n\n\n== Health ==\nIn Graz there are seven hospitals, several private hospitals and sanatoriums, as well as 44 pharmacies.\nThe University Hospital Graz (LKH-Universit\u00e4ts-Klinikum Graz) is located in eastern Graz and has 1,556 beds and 7,190 employees. The Regional Hospital Graz II (LKH Graz II) has two sites in Graz.

Furthermore, several non-emergency ambulances (KTW \u2013 Krankentransportwagen) and a Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) are operated by the Red Cross to transport non-emergency patients to and between hospitals. In addition to the Red Cross, the Labourers'-Samaritan-Alliance (Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund \u00d6sterreichs), the Austrian organisation of the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps (Malteser Hospitaldienst Austria) and the Green Cross (Gr\u00fcnes Kreuz) operate ambulances (KTW) for non-emergency patient transport. In addition to the cars, there's also the C12 air ambulance helicopter stationed at Graz airport, staffed with an emergency physician in addition to regular personnel.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nGraz is twinned with:\n\nOther forms of cooperation and city friendship similar to the twin city programmes\n Ni\u0161, Serbia\n Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nThe following are past and present notable residents of Graz.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Austria portal\nList of World Heritage Sites in Austria\nKastner & \u00d6hler\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"Graz: Stadtplanung und Stadtentwicklung (Rechnungshofbericht, 2006) in German\" (PDF). 2006.

        "wiki": "Pranckh is the name of an ancient Austrian noble family, descending from Pranckh Castle, near Sankt Marein bei Knittelfeld in the former March and later Duchy of Styria. The family's origins date back to the year 1135, when Wolfkerus de Branka attested a charter regarding an endowment to Admont Abbey, thus making it one of the oldest families in Austria still present today. In addition to the Styrian mainline, other branches existed in Salzburg, Carinthia, Lower Austria and Bavaria.\nIn later parts of history, the family rose from Knights to Reichsfreiherren (Barons of the Holy Roman Empire) and Reichsgrafen (Imperial Counts of the Holy Roman Empire).\nMany of their names can be found in high court and state offices of the Archbishopric of Salzburg. Branches of the family exist to this day in Austria, Germany, France and the United States.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins and Styrian line ===\nThe family traces its origins back to Feistritz bei Knittelfeld in Styria, where it first appeared in documents dated 1135, when Wolfkerus de Branka testified an endowment made by his brother Pilgrim von Feistritz to the Benedictine Abbey of Admont.\nThey were knights of the free nobles of Feistritz-Traisen, which subsequently, under Adalram von Waldeck, a descendant of the Aribonids, founded the Augustinian Abbey of Seckau in 1140, which explains the family's close relationship with Seckau.\nAfter their principals had become extinct, they became ministeriales of the territorial lords and provosts of Seckau, among them Arnold, Ortolf, who decreed renovations and new constructions of the Abbey, as well as Ulrich II. von Pranckh. \nThe family crypt was located in Seckau as well, where to this day the red marble tombs of the nobles Johannes Pranckhher von Pranckh and Ernst Pranckhher of Pranckh are preserved.The continuous succession of the family begins in 1242 with Ulrich von Pranckh. In 1298 the marriage between Friedrich von Pranckh and heiress Anna von Pux, descendant of the Saint Countess Hemma von Gurk was officiated. Anna von Pux brought her coat of arms, estates in Styria and Carinthia and the future ruling seat of the family, the castle of Pux, located at the upper bank of the Mur near Teufenbach.\nHowever, the ruling seat was not moved to Pux until 1425. A different part of the family remained in St. Marein, which saw increased invasions of the Turks during these times \u2013 they however did not dare to attack the castle of Pranckh.In 1459, Ernst Pranckhher Knight von Pranckh zu Katsch awarded the Benedictine Admont of Abbey the right to collect tithe and the Zehenthof zu Petersdorf in St. Peter am Kammersberg to further underline the family's relation with the Abbey.\nFurthermore, the family maintained close relations with the Benedictine Abbey of G\u00f6ss by for instance providing abbesses.\n\n\n=== Lower Austrian line ===\nThe Lower Austrian line of the family was established by Ernst von Pranckh zu Bockfliess, governor of the lower quarter under the Manhartsberg (Weinviertel).\nDescendants include Eustachius von Pranckh zu Rickersdorf, who acquired the Veste Hof located at the river banks of the March. His son Friedrich von Pranckh later moved the castle to the higher situated location Hofberg and thus laid the foundation of Schloss Hof, later owned by Prince Eugene of Savoy.\nAs the oldest owners of Engelhartstetten, the community where Schloss Hof is located, two mutually crenellated red crossbars of the Lords of Pranckh are shown in the municipal coat of arms.\n\n\n=== Salzburg line ===\nThe progenitor of the thriving line is Ulrich von Pranckh (\u2020 1416/1420), from which onwards descending lines are fully established. Closer progenitor is Rupprecht von Pranckh (\u2020 1575). His son Roman founded the Salzburg line of the family by marrying Anna Susanna von \u00dcberacker, who belonged to Bavarian Uradel. In 1628, Emperor Ferdinand II elevated Johann Christoph Knight von Pranckh, member of the imperial war council and seneschal, Lord of Pux, Poppendorf, Rhine Valley and Frondsberg, together with all blood relatives, to hereditary Barons of the Holy Roman Empire (Reichsfreiherrenstand), and raised to Salzburg state estates in 1651. In 1719, the brothers Ferdinand Josef and Georg Wilhelm, Lord of Sch\u00f6nau, Hallenau and Zinzendorf were raised to Imperial Counts of the Holy Roman Empire (Reichsgrafenstand) by Emperor Charles VI.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, however, the counts\u2019 line became extinct. In 1765 Leopold Count von Pranckh, colonel and commander of the praiseworthy 2nd Bavarian district regiment, became Lord and Landmann of Salzburg.\n\n\n=== Bavarian line ===\nSiegmund Amadeus Freiherr von Pranckh (* 1768), descendant from the Salzburg branch of the family, following services in the Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg and Austrian military, relocated his seat to Bavaria where he was appointed royal treasurer and lieutenant colonel.\nHis son Siegmund (* 1821) became the royal Bavarian Minister of War and General and initiated the extensive army reform of 1868. He was also significantly involved in the conclusion of the Treaty of Versailles in 1870 and was granted an endowment of 100,000 crowns from the war compensation awards for his achievements. In 1873 he returned to Styria to take over the allodial entailed rule Pux from Ludwig (\u2020 1880), the last descendant of the Styrian line at the time.\n\n\n== Estates and rulership ==\nThe reach of the family Pranckh primarily covered the upper valley of the Mur. Besides castle Pranckh and castle Pux, they controlled the following sites in Styria:\n\nAltenhofen\nBirkenstein\nDornhofen\nEppenstein\nFeistritz am Kammersberg\nFohnsdorf\nFriedhofen\nFrojach\nFrondsberg\nGabelhofen (Riegersdorf)\nGilgenb\u00fchel\nGoppelsbach\nGrubenhof bei Graz\nGrubhof bei Judenburg\nGutenhag\nHautzenbichl\nHohenburg\nKarlsberg\nKatsch\nKohlsberg\nLuegg\nOberdorf\nOberlorenzen\nPachern\nPerchau am Sattel\nPichlhofen\nPlankenwarth\nPoppendorf\nPrankerhof (Adelsb\u00fchel)\nRachau\nReifenstein\nReinthal\nRothenfels bei Oberw\u00f6lz\nSchallaun\nSchrattenberg\nSiegersdorf bei Herberstein\nSchloss Sonneck (St. Bartholom\u00e4) (Buschenschl\u00f6ssl)\nWaldstein (Alt-Waldstein)\nWaldstein (Deutschfeistritz)\nWartberg (Liechtenegg)\nWasserleithUpper Austria: \n\nFeldegg\nOberalm\nSchieferegg\nWaikhartsbergLower Austria: \n\nBockflie\u00df\nEngelhartstetten\nGrafenweiden\nMarkthof\nNiederweiden\nSchloss Hof\nSch\u00f6nauSalzburg: \n\nAigen\nBaron-Pranckh Haus at Sigmund-Haffner-Gasse\nEichen\nHaunsperg\nPrenzingerau\nReiterhaus at Getreidegasse\nSeeburg\nUrsprung\nWiespachVienna: \n\nLaudonSlovenia: \n\nSne\u017enik Castle\n\n\n=== Current estates ===\nAs of today, the castles Pux, Hautzenbichl and Windern as well as the former cave castles Schallaun and Luegg are privately owned by the family.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Coat of arms ==\nThe initial coat of arms of Pranckh shows two crenellated cross-beams in silver. The crest consists of red and-silver mantling with a pair of red horns on the right and a pair of silver horns left, which on their outsides are crested with colour-changing combs.\nThe coat of arms of the Barons von Pranckh zu Pux was formed by the marriage between Friedrich von Pranckh and Anna von Pux, and officiated by Emperor Ferdinand II. in 1628. The coat arms is quartered and shows the baronial crown. Fields one and four show the original coat of arms, with two crenellated cross-beams in silver against a red background. Fields two and three show three slanted spearheads in silver (the boar spears of the von Pux family) against red background. The first helmet shows the original crest of Pranckh, with red and silver mantling, a pair of buffalo horns, red on the right and silver on the left, with black tufts of feathers on the outside. The second helmet represents the Pux family and shows a closed vol in red with three slanted spearheads in silver over red-silver mantling.The coat of arms of the Counts von Pranckh zu Pux is quartered, with the initial coat of arms of Pranckh embedded as heart-shaped escutcheon and the comital crown on top. Fields one and four show three slanted spearheads of Pux in silver against red background. Fields two and three show the coat of arms of Colaus, halved diagonally in red and silver. On top are three crowned helmets with red and silver mantling. The first helmet of Pux shows a closed vol in red with three slanted spearheads in silver. The central helmet of Pranckh shows a pair of red and silver buffalo horns with black tufts of feathers on the outside. The third helmet of Colaus is decorated with three ostrich feathers in red-silver-red.\n\n\n=== Historical coat of arms ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Local coat of arms ===\n\n\n== Burial helmet of Pranckh ==\n\nThe burial helmet of the family of Pranckh is one of the most famous crested medieval bucket helmets, the only other existing specimen is the one from the Black Prince of Canterbury.\nThe helmet was likely to be used during tournaments, as its additional front reinforcements suggest. Presumably, it belonged to Albert von Pranckh, who carried an almost identical helmet in his coat of arms, and dates back to the first half of the 14th century. The crest shows a golden pair of buffalo horns, embellished with silver outer ridges, covered in leather. Following a crusade, it was donated to the Abbey of Seckau, where it hung with two funerary hatchments over the family crypt of Pranckh. In 1878 it was acquired for the imperial collection in Vienna and is currently on display at the armoury of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.\n\n\n== People ==\nEustachius von Pranckh zu Rickersdorf (16th century), Lord on Schloss Hof and Markthof in Lower Austria\nFriedrich von Pranckh zu Rickersdorf (ca. 1620), Lord on Schloss Hof, Markthof, Grafenweiden and Niederweiden in Lower Austria; founder of Schloss Hof\nAdam Gottlieb von Pranckh (ca. 1647), Baron on Seeburg in Seekirchen am Wallersee, Salzburg\nSiegmund von Pranckh (1821\u20131888), Bavarian General and Minister of War\nHans von Pranckh (1888\u20131945), Bavarian Officer, Baron on Pux in Styria and Austrian Heimwehrf\u00fchrer\nPilgrim von Pranckh]] (1923\u20132013), Baron on Hautzenbichl in Styria\nGeorg von Pranckh (1926-2005), Austrian politician (\u00d6VP)\nGeorg von Pranckh (* 1952), Austrian politician (FP\u00d6)\nPilgrim von Pranckh (* 1955), Baron on Pux in Styria\n\n\n== Literature ==\nGenealogical Handbook of Nobility, Adelslexikon Edition X, Edition 119 of the series, pp. 521\u2013522, C.

          "A good workout climbing the steep hill to get to the castle ruins. A fun piece of history for those of us who grew up reading Robin Hood. Beautiful views from the ruins.",
          "Durnstein was one of the stops on our Danube River Cruise and what a beautiful village it is! There is so much history here with an incredible view from the castle ruins. The people are friendly and welcoming. I have an affinity for the small, European villages and this one",
          "Around the castle is the village of Dunstein with its historic architecture and touristic town. Lots of history as you walk around. The castle is impressive",
          "D\u00fcrnstein is a pretty European town with lovely shops and restaurants. The castle ruins where King Richard the Lionheart was imprisoned is a bit of a challenge to see but worth going. Beautiful scenery from there of the Wachau Valley",
          "What a lovely little village! My husband and I took a river cruise and we stopped there. The climbing is worth it as long you are in good shape! and we liked to stroll around in the village. Very nice!",
          "Step back into history and enjoy lovely views of the Danube and surrounding countryside. Many uneven, rocky stairs as you switchback your way to the top, but it's well worth it.",
          "My daughter and I recently rented Nextbikes and rode from Krems to Durnstein castle ruins. We then hiked up the fairly aggressive climb to the top of Durnstein castle ruins for amazing views of the town and surrounding vineyards. After the much easier hike down, we enjoyed lunch",
          "This ruined medieval castle (early 12th century) is well worth a visit if you\u2019re reasonably fit. There seem to be two access points - lots of steps or a steep path on the other side. If you take the steps, make sure you deviate at the very start to have a look at the lovely",
          "We hiked up to the castle ruins and were not disappointed. What beautiful views of the town, cathedral, and Danube below! We spent close to an hour getting up, another hour taking photos and enjoying the view, and about 30 minutes to walk down to town.",
          "The small castle is located on a steep hill overlooking the Danube and offers excellent views over the river and the surrounding valley. Its claim to fame is that the British King Richard the Lionheart was held captive here while returning from the crusades. The castle is",
          "Luckily we were stopping in Durnstein so we got the chance. What made it all hat more interesting besides the hearty climb to the castle ruins, was the fact that Richard the Lionhearted was imprisoned here from the Crusades. Not an easy climb so be prepared.",
          "It was a dream come true to visit this castle and surrounding town having read so much about the life of Richard 1.The town is small but very picturesque with vineyards surrounding it. The climb to the castle not only shows where Richard was imprisoned but there are also",
          "I stayed at the base of the Burgershanke Hotel at the foot of the hill leading up to the castle. I took the walk each evening for four weeks after dinner and stayed at the top for an hour usually. The walk up the path and trees lining it were beautiful. I went to \"just be\" in",
          "Climb the hill to reach the old town with its medieval charm, quaint little stores, vineyards all around, old castle where Kind Richard II of England was briefly held for ransom. Visit the old monastery, with its lovely baroque church. Enjoy the Danube river views.",

          "We were here 20 or more years ago, and the views are wonderful. I was fascinated by the story of Richard the Lion Heart, King of England, having been held captive here during the Crusades. It's an interesting story. On that trip, we made the climb to the top, wonderful views.",
          "Our ship docked in the City of Durnstein at 7 in the morning. After breakfast those who chose to do a \u201cstrenuous, steep climb\u201d set out with our guide to climb the hill up to the castle.

        "wiki": "Graz ( GRAHTS, German: [\u0261\u0281a\u02d0ts] (listen); Slovene: Gradec) is the capital city of Styria and Austria's second-largest city after Vienna. As of 1 January 2019, Graz had a population of 328,276 (292,269 of whom had principal-residence status). In 2015, the population of the Graz larger urban zone (LUZ) stood at 633,168, based on principal-residence status. Graz has a long tradition as a seat of higher education. It has four colleges and four universities with more than 60,000 students. Its historic centre  (Altstadt) is one of the best-preserved city centres in Central Europe.For centuries, Graz was more important to Slovenes and Croats, both politically and culturally, than the capitals of Ljubljana, Slovenia and Zagreb, Croatia; it remains influential to this day. In 1999, the city's historic centre was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites and in 2010 the designation was expanded to include Eggenberg Palace (German: Schloss Eggenberg) on the western edge of the city. Graz was designated the Cultural Capital of Europe in 2003 and became a City of Culinary Delights in 2008.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name of the city, Graz, formerly spelled Gratz, most likely stems from the Slavic gradec, which means \"small castle\". Some archaeological finds point to the erection of a small castle by Alpine Slavic people, which over time became a heavily defended fortification. In literary Slovene and Croatian, gradec still means \"small castle\", forming a hypocoristic derivative of Proto-West-South Slavic *grad\u044cc\u044a, whichs descends via liquid metathesis from Common Slavic *gard\u044cc\u044a and via the Slavic third palatalisation from Proto-Slavic *gardiku, originally denoting \"small town, settlement\". The name thus follows the common South Slavic pattern for naming settlements as grad. The German name 'Graz' first appears in records in 1128.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGraz is situated on both sides of the Mur river in southeast Austria. It is about 200 km (120 mi) southwest of Vienna (Wien). The nearest larger urban centre is Maribor (Marburg) in Slovenia, which is about 50 km (31 mi) to the south. Graz is the state capital and largest city in Styria, a green and heavily forested region on the eastern edge of the Alps.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring municipalities ===\nThese towns and villages border Graz:\n\nto the north: Gratkorn, Stattegg, Weinitzen\nto the east: Kainbach bei Graz, Hart bei Graz, Raaba\nto the south: G\u00f6ssendorf, Feldkirchen bei Graz, Seiersberg\nto the west: Attendorf, Thal, Judendorf-Stra\u00dfengel\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nGraz is divided into 17 municipal districts (Stadtbezirke):\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement on the ground of the modern city of Graz dates back to the Copper Age. However, no historical continuity exists of a settlement before the Middle Ages.\nDuring the 12th century, dukes under Babenberg rule made the town into an important commercial center. Later, Graz came under the rule of the Habsburgs and, in 1281, gained special privileges from King Rudolph I.\nIn the 14th century, Graz became the city of residence of the Inner Austrian line of the Habsburgs. The royalty lived in the Schlossberg castle and from there ruled Styria, Carinthia, most of today's Slovenia, and parts of Italy (Carniola, Gorizia and Gradisca, Trieste).\nIn the 16th century, the city's design and planning were primarily controlled by Italian Renaissance architects and artists. One of the most famous buildings representative of this style is the Landhaus, designed by Domenico dell'Allio, and used by the local rulers as a governmental headquarters.\n\nThe University of Graz was founded by Archduke Karl II in 1585, it's the city's oldest university. For most of its existence, it was controlled by the Catholic church, and was closed in 1782 by Joseph II in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a lyceum where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-established as a university by Emperor Franz I, and was named 'Karl-Franzens Universit\u00e4t' or 'Charles-Francis University' in English. More than 30,000 students are currently enrolled at this university.\nThe astronomer Johannes Kepler lived in Graz for a short period. He worked as a math teacher and was a professor of mathematics at the University of Graz, but still found time to study astronomy. He left Graz for Prague when Lutherans were banned from the city.\nLudwig Boltzmann was Professor for Mathematical Physics from 1869 to 1890. During that time, Nikola Tesla studied electrical engineering at the Polytechnic in 1875. Nobel Laureate Otto Loewi taught at the University of Graz from 1909 until 1938. Ivo Andric, the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature Laureate obtained his doctorate at the University of Graz. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger was briefly chancellor of the University of Graz in 1936.\nGraz is centrally located within today's Bundesland (state) of Styria, or Steiermark in German. Mark is an old German word indicating a large area of land used as a defensive border, in which the peasantry is taught how to organize and fight in the case of an invasion. With a strategic location at the head of the open and fertile Mur valley, Graz was historically a target of invaders, such as the Hungarians under Matthias Corvinus in 1481, and the Ottoman Turks in 1529 and 1532. Apart from the Riegersburg Castle, the Schlossberg was the only fortification in the region that never fell to the Ottoman Turks. Graz is home to the region's provincial armory, which is the world's largest historical collection of late medieval and Renaissance weaponry. It has been preserved since 1551, and displays over 30,000 items.\nFrom the earlier part of the 15th century, Graz was the residence of the younger branch of the Habsburgs, which succeeded to the imperial throne in 1619 in the person of Emperor Ferdinand II, who moved the capital to Vienna. New fortifications were built on the Schlossberg at the end of the 16th century. Napoleon's army occupied Graz in 1797. In 1809, the city withstood another assault by the French army. During this attack, the commanding officer in the fortress was ordered to defend it with about 900 men against Napoleon's army of about 3,000. He successfully defended the Schlossberg against eight attacks, but they were forced to give up after the Grande Arm\u00e9e occupied Vienna and the Emperor ordered to surrender. Following the defeat of Austria by Napoleonic forces at the Battle of Wagram in 1809, the fortifications were demolished using explosives, as stipulated in the Peace of Sch\u00f6nbrunn of the same year. The belltower (Glockenturm) and the civic clock tower (Uhrturm), which is a leading tourist attraction and serves as a symbol for Graz, were spared after the citizens of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation.Archduke Karl II of Inner Austria had 20,000 Protestant books burned in the square of what is now a mental hospital, and succeeded in returning Styria to the authority of the Holy See. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was born in Graz in what is now the Stadtmuseum (city museum).\n\n\n== Population development ==\nThe more recent population figures do not give the whole picture as only people with principal-residence status are counted and people with secondary residence status are not. Most of the people with secondary residence status in Graz are students. At the end of 2016 there were 33,473 people with secondary residence status in Graz.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nOceanic climate is the type found in the city, but due to the 0 \u00b0C isotherm, the same occurs in a humid continental climate with based in K\u00f6ppen system (Cfb/Dfb borderline). Wladimir K\u00f6ppen himself was in town and conducted studies to see how the climate of the past influenced the Continental Drift theory. Due to its position southeast of the Alps, Graz is shielded from the prevailing westerly winds that bring weather fronts in from the North Atlantic to northwestern and central Europe. The weather in Graz is thus influenced by the Mediterranean, and it has more hours of sunshine per year than Vienna or Salzburg and also less wind or rain. Graz lies in a basin that is only open to the south, causing the climate to be warmer than would be expected at that latitude. Plants are found in Graz that normally grow much further south.\n\naverage temperatures: Graz Airport 8.7 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) / Karl-Franzens University 9.4 \u00b0C (49 \u00b0F)\naverage rainfall: 818 mm (32 in) with on average 92 days of rain (Karl Franzens University)\naverage hours of sunshine: 1,989 (Karl Franzens University)\n\n\n== Slovenes and Graz ==\nPolitically, culturally, scientifically and religiously, Graz was an important centre for all Slovenes, especially from the establishment of the University of Graz in 1586 until the establishment of University of Ljubljana in 1919. In 1574, the first Slovene Catholic book was published in Graz, and in 1592, Hieronymus Megiser published in Graz the book Dictionarium quatuor linguarum, the first multilingual dictionary of Slovene.The Styrian Slovenes did not consider Graz a German-speaking city, but their own, a place to study while living at their relatives' homes and to fulfill one's career ambitions. The student associations in Graz were a crucible of the Slovene identity, and the Slovene students in Graz were more nationally aware than some others. This led to fierce anti-Slovene efforts of German-speaking nationalists in Graz before and during World War II.Many Slovenian Styrians study there. Slovenes are among the professors at the Institute for Jazz in Graz. Numerous Slovenes have found employment there, while being formerly unemployed in Slovenia. For the Slovene culture, Graz remains permanently important due to its university and the Universalmuseum Joanneum archives containing numerous documents from the Slovenian Styria.A symposium on the relation of Graz and the Slovenes was held in Graz in 2010, at the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the first and oldest chair of Slovene. It was established at the Lyzeum of Graz in July 1811 on the initiative of Janez Nepomuk Primic. A collection of lectures on the topic was published. The Slovenian Post commemorated the anniversary with a stamp.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nFor the year that Graz was Cultural Capital of Europe, new structures were erected. The Graz Museum of Contemporary Art (German: Kunsthaus) was designed by Peter Cook and Colin Fournier and is situated next to the Mur river. The Island in the Mur is a floating platform made of steel. It was designed by American architect Vito Acconci and contains a caf\u00e9, an open-air theatre and a playground.\n\n\n=== Historic city centre ===\n\nThe historic centre was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999 due to the harmonious co-existence of typical buildings from different epochs and in different architectural styles. Situated in a cultural borderland between Central Europe, Italy and the Balkan States, Graz absorbed various influences from the neighbouring regions and thus received its exceptional townscape. Today the historic centre consists of over 1,000 buildings, their age ranging from Gothic to contemporary.\nThe most important sights in the historic centre are:\n\nTown Hall (Rathaus).\nThe Castle hill (German: Schlossberg), a hill dominating the historic centre (475 m (1,558.40 ft) high), site of a demolished fortress, with views over Graz.\nThe Clock Tower (Uhrturm) is a symbol of Graz, at the top of the Castle hill.\nThe New Gallery (Neue Galerie), a museum of art.\nThe Castle hill funicular (Schlossbergbahn), a funicular railway on the Castle hill's slope.\nThe seat of Styria's provincial parliament (Landhaus), a palace in Lombardic style.

It features the oldest painted view of Graz.\nThe mausoleum of Emperor Ferdinand II next to the cathedral, the most important building of Mannerism in Graz. It includes both the grave where Ferdinand II and his wife are buried, and a church dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria.\nThe Castle (Burg), with Gothic double staircase, built between 1438 and 1453 by Emperor Frederick III, because the old castle on the Schlossberg hill was too small and uncomfortable. The castle remained the residence of the Inner Austrian Court until 1619. Today, it serves as residence for the Styrian government.\nThe Painted House (Gemaltes Haus) in Herrengasse 3. It is completely covered with frescos (painted in 1742 by Johann Mayer).\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art Graz (Kunsthaus)\nThe Island in the Mur (Murinsel), an artificial island in the Mur river.\nBuildings, inner courtyards (e. g.

The Grazer AK also won an Austrian championship, but went into administration in 2007 and was excluded from the professional league system.\nIn ice hockey, the ATSE Graz was the Austrian Hockey League champion in 1975 and 1978. The EC Graz was runner-up in 1991\u201392, 1992\u201393 and 1993\u201394. The Graz 99ers plays in first division since 2000.\nUBSC Raiffeisen Graz plays in the Austrian Basketball League.\nThe Graz Giants play in the Austrian Football League (American Football).\nThe city bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics in 1995, but lost the election to Salt Lake City. Nowadays there is a plan to bid for the 2026 Winter Olympics with some venues in Bavaria, Germany to cut costs with using existing venues around national borders. It's still facing referendum, meaning usually the end for many former olympic bids in Europe and North America since 1970 -century.\n\n\n=== Styriarte ===\nGraz hosts the annual festival of classical music Styriarte, founded in 1985 to tie conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt closer to his hometown. Events have been held at different venues in Graz and in the surrounding region.\n\n\n=== Dialect ===\nReferred to as Steirisch by locals, Graz belongs to the Austro-Bavarian region of dialects, more specifically a mix of Central Bavarian in the western part of Styria and Southern Bavarian in the eastern part. The Grazer ORF, the Graz subsidiary of Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, launched an initiative in 2008 called Scho wieda Steirisch g'redt in order to highlight the numerous dialects of Graz and Styria in general and to cultivate the pride many Styrians hold for their local culture. Two reasons for a melding of these dialects with Standard German: the influence of television and radio bringing Standard German into the home and the industrialization causing the disappearance of the single farmer since the farming communities are seen as the true keepers of dialect speaking.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nAn extensive public transport network makes Graz an easy city to navigate without a car. The city has a comprehensive bus network, complementing the Graz tram network consisting of eight lines. Four lines pass through the underground tram stop at the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof) and on to the city centre before branching out. Furthermore, there are seven night-time bus routes, although these run only at weekends and on evenings preceding public holidays.\nThe Schlossbergbahn, a funicular railway, and the Schlossberg lift, a vertical lift, link the city centre to the Schlossberg.\nFrom the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), regional trains link to most of Styria. Direct trains run to most major cities nearby including Vienna, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Maribor and Ljubljana in Slovenia, Zagreb in Croatia, Budapest in Hungary, Prague and Brno in the Czech Republic, Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland, as well as Munich, Stuttgart, Heidelberg, and Frankfurt in Germany. Trains for Vienna leave every hour. In recent years many railway stations within the city limits and in the suburbs have been rebuilt or modernised and are now part of the \"S-Bahn Graz\", a commuter train service connecting the city with its suburban area and towns nearby.\nGraz airport is located about 10 km (6 mi) south of the city centre and is accessible by bus, railway, and car. Direct destinations include Amsterdam, Berlin, D\u00fcsseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart, Istanbul, Vienna and Zurich.\n\n\n== Health ==\nIn Graz there are seven hospitals, several private hospitals and sanatoriums, as well as 44 pharmacies.\nThe University Hospital Graz (LKH-Universit\u00e4ts-Klinikum Graz) is located in eastern Graz and has 1,556 beds and 7,190 employees. The Regional Hospital Graz II (LKH Graz II) has two sites in Graz. The western site (LKH Graz II Standort West) is located in Eggenberg and has 280 beds and about 500 employees, the southern site (LKH Graz II Standort S\u00fcd) specializes in neurology and psychiatry and is located in Stra\u00dfgang with 880 beds and 1,100 employees. The AUVA Accident Hospital (Unfallkrankenhaus der AUVA) is in Eggenberg and has 180 beds and a total of 444 employees.\nThe Albert Schweitzer Clinic in the western part of the city is a geriatric hospital with 304 beds, the Hospital of St. John of God (Krankenhaus der Barmherzigen Br\u00fcder) has two sites in Graz, one in Lend with 225 beds and one in Eggenberg with 260 beds. The Hospital of the Order of Saint Elizabeth (Krankenhaus der Elisabethinen) in Gries has 182 beds.\nThere are several private clinics as well: the Privatklinik Kastanienhof, the Privatklinik Leech, the Privatklinik der Kreuzschwestern, the Sanatorium St. Leonhard, the Sanatorium Hansa and the Privatklinik Graz-Ragnitz.\nEMS in Graz is provided solely by the Austrian Red Cross. Perpetually two emergency doctor's cars (NEF \u2013 Notarzteinsatzfahrzeug), two NAWs (Notarztwagen \u2013 ambulances staffed with a physician in addition to regular personnel) and about 30 RTWs (Rettungswagen \u2013 regular ambulances) are on standby. Furthermore, several non-emergency ambulances (KTW \u2013 Krankentransportwagen) and a Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) are operated by the Red Cross to transport non-emergency patients to and between hospitals. In addition to the Red Cross, the Labourers'-Samaritan-Alliance (Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund \u00d6sterreichs), the Austrian organisation of the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps (Malteser Hospitaldienst Austria) and the Green Cross (Gr\u00fcnes Kreuz) operate ambulances (KTW) for non-emergency patient transport. In addition to the cars, there's also the C12 air ambulance helicopter stationed at Graz airport, staffed with an emergency physician in addition to regular personnel.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nGraz is twinned with:\n\nOther forms of cooperation and city friendship similar to the twin city programmes\n Ni\u0161, Serbia\n Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nThe following are past and present notable residents of Graz.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Austria portal\nList of World Heritage Sites in Austria\nKastner & \u00d6hler\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"Graz: Stadtplanung und Stadtentwicklung (Rechnungshofbericht, 2006) in German\" (PDF). 2006.

          "It was a nice experience to be at this shopping city...cool habitant,great view with good cultural people.",
          "nice selection of stores, but smoking is allowed in the mall and it is EVERYWHERE. I actually think they may have changed this in the last year or so, i have been here about 6 times and each time i left very stuffed up and hair smelling like smoke. eh.",
          "If you live close to Graz its good place for a nice shopping. You can find lot of stores with branded clothes and also enough stores with the regular clothing. Its a nice large complex, with outdoor parking slots, and with some paarking slots in the underground garage. You can"

        "wiki": "Graz ( GRAHTS, German: [\u0261\u0281a\u02d0ts] (listen); Slovene: Gradec) is the capital city of Styria and Austria's second-largest city after Vienna. As of 1 January 2019, Graz had a population of 328,276 (292,269 of whom had principal-residence status). In 2015, the population of the Graz larger urban zone (LUZ) stood at 633,168, based on principal-residence status. Graz has a long tradition as a seat of higher education. It has four colleges and four universities with more than 60,000 students. Its historic centre  (Altstadt) is one of the best-preserved city centres in Central Europe.For centuries, Graz was more important to Slovenes and Croats, both politically and culturally, than the capitals of Ljubljana, Slovenia and Zagreb, Croatia; it remains influential to this day. In 1999, the city's historic centre was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites and in 2010 the designation was expanded to include Eggenberg Palace (German: Schloss Eggenberg) on the western edge of the city. Graz was designated the Cultural Capital of Europe in 2003 and became a City of Culinary Delights in 2008.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name of the city, Graz, formerly spelled Gratz, most likely stems from the Slavic gradec, which means \"small castle\". Some archaeological finds point to the erection of a small castle by Alpine Slavic people, which over time became a heavily defended fortification. In literary Slovene and Croatian, gradec still means \"small castle\", forming a hypocoristic derivative of Proto-West-South Slavic *grad\u044cc\u044a, whichs descends via liquid metathesis from Common Slavic *gard\u044cc\u044a and via the Slavic third palatalisation from Proto-Slavic *gardiku, originally denoting \"small town, settlement\". The name thus follows the common South Slavic pattern for naming settlements as grad. The German name 'Graz' first appears in records in 1128.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGraz is situated on both sides of the Mur river in southeast Austria. It is about 200 km (120 mi) southwest of Vienna (Wien). The nearest larger urban centre is Maribor (Marburg) in Slovenia, which is about 50 km (31 mi) to the south. Graz is the state capital and largest city in Styria, a green and heavily forested region on the eastern edge of the Alps.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring municipalities ===\nThese towns and villages border Graz:\n\nto the north: Gratkorn, Stattegg, Weinitzen\nto the east: Kainbach bei Graz, Hart bei Graz, Raaba\nto the south: G\u00f6ssendorf, Feldkirchen bei Graz, Seiersberg\nto the west: Attendorf, Thal, Judendorf-Stra\u00dfengel\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nGraz is divided into 17 municipal districts (Stadtbezirke):\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement on the ground of the modern city of Graz dates back to the Copper Age. However, no historical continuity exists of a settlement before the Middle Ages.\nDuring the 12th century, dukes under Babenberg rule made the town into an important commercial center. Later, Graz came under the rule of the Habsburgs and, in 1281, gained special privileges from King Rudolph I.\nIn the 14th century, Graz became the city of residence of the Inner Austrian line of the Habsburgs. The royalty lived in the Schlossberg castle and from there ruled Styria, Carinthia, most of today's Slovenia, and parts of Italy (Carniola, Gorizia and Gradisca, Trieste).\nIn the 16th century, the city's design and planning were primarily controlled by Italian Renaissance architects and artists. One of the most famous buildings representative of this style is the Landhaus, designed by Domenico dell'Allio, and used by the local rulers as a governmental headquarters.\n\nThe University of Graz was founded by Archduke Karl II in 1585, it's the city's oldest university. For most of its existence, it was controlled by the Catholic church, and was closed in 1782 by Joseph II in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a lyceum where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-established as a university by Emperor Franz I, and was named 'Karl-Franzens Universit\u00e4t' or 'Charles-Francis University' in English. More than 30,000 students are currently enrolled at this university.\nThe astronomer Johannes Kepler lived in Graz for a short period. He worked as a math teacher and was a professor of mathematics at the University of Graz, but still found time to study astronomy. He left Graz for Prague when Lutherans were banned from the city.\nLudwig Boltzmann was Professor for Mathematical Physics from 1869 to 1890. During that time, Nikola Tesla studied electrical engineering at the Polytechnic in 1875. Nobel Laureate Otto Loewi taught at the University of Graz from 1909 until 1938. Ivo Andric, the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature Laureate obtained his doctorate at the University of Graz. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger was briefly chancellor of the University of Graz in 1936.\nGraz is centrally located within today's Bundesland (state) of Styria, or Steiermark in German. Mark is an old German word indicating a large area of land used as a defensive border, in which the peasantry is taught how to organize and fight in the case of an invasion. With a strategic location at the head of the open and fertile Mur valley, Graz was historically a target of invaders, such as the Hungarians under Matthias Corvinus in 1481, and the Ottoman Turks in 1529 and 1532. Apart from the Riegersburg Castle, the Schlossberg was the only fortification in the region that never fell to the Ottoman Turks. Graz is home to the region's provincial armory, which is the world's largest historical collection of late medieval and Renaissance weaponry. It has been preserved since 1551, and displays over 30,000 items.\nFrom the earlier part of the 15th century, Graz was the residence of the younger branch of the Habsburgs, which succeeded to the imperial throne in 1619 in the person of Emperor Ferdinand II, who moved the capital to Vienna. New fortifications were built on the Schlossberg at the end of the 16th century. Napoleon's army occupied Graz in 1797. In 1809, the city withstood another assault by the French army. During this attack, the commanding officer in the fortress was ordered to defend it with about 900 men against Napoleon's army of about 3,000. He successfully defended the Schlossberg against eight attacks, but they were forced to give up after the Grande Arm\u00e9e occupied Vienna and the Emperor ordered to surrender. Following the defeat of Austria by Napoleonic forces at the Battle of Wagram in 1809, the fortifications were demolished using explosives, as stipulated in the Peace of Sch\u00f6nbrunn of the same year. The belltower (Glockenturm) and the civic clock tower (Uhrturm), which is a leading tourist attraction and serves as a symbol for Graz, were spared after the citizens of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation.Archduke Karl II of Inner Austria had 20,000 Protestant books burned in the square of what is now a mental hospital, and succeeded in returning Styria to the authority of the Holy See. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was born in Graz in what is now the Stadtmuseum (city museum).\n\n\n== Population development ==\nThe more recent population figures do not give the whole picture as only people with principal-residence status are counted and people with secondary residence status are not. Most of the people with secondary residence status in Graz are students. At the end of 2016 there were 33,473 people with secondary residence status in Graz.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nOceanic climate is the type found in the city, but due to the 0 \u00b0C isotherm, the same occurs in a humid continental climate with based in K\u00f6ppen system (Cfb/Dfb borderline). Wladimir K\u00f6ppen himself was in town and conducted studies to see how the climate of the past influenced the Continental Drift theory. Due to its position southeast of the Alps, Graz is shielded from the prevailing westerly winds that bring weather fronts in from the North Atlantic to northwestern and central Europe. The weather in Graz is thus influenced by the Mediterranean, and it has more hours of sunshine per year than Vienna or Salzburg and also less wind or rain. Graz lies in a basin that is only open to the south, causing the climate to be warmer than would be expected at that latitude. Plants are found in Graz that normally grow much further south.\n\naverage temperatures: Graz Airport 8.7 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) / Karl-Franzens University 9.4 \u00b0C (49 \u00b0F)\naverage rainfall: 818 mm (32 in) with on average 92 days of rain (Karl Franzens University)\naverage hours of sunshine: 1,989 (Karl Franzens University)\n\n\n== Slovenes and Graz ==\nPolitically, culturally, scientifically and religiously, Graz was an important centre for all Slovenes, especially from the establishment of the University of Graz in 1586 until the establishment of University of Ljubljana in 1919. In 1574, the first Slovene Catholic book was published in Graz, and in 1592, Hieronymus Megiser published in Graz the book Dictionarium quatuor linguarum, the first multilingual dictionary of Slovene.The Styrian Slovenes did not consider Graz a German-speaking city, but their own, a place to study while living at their relatives' homes and to fulfill one's career ambitions. The student associations in Graz were a crucible of the Slovene identity, and the Slovene students in Graz were more nationally aware than some others. This led to fierce anti-Slovene efforts of German-speaking nationalists in Graz before and during World War II.Many Slovenian Styrians study there. Slovenes are among the professors at the Institute for Jazz in Graz. Numerous Slovenes have found employment there, while being formerly unemployed in Slovenia. For the Slovene culture, Graz remains permanently important due to its university and the Universalmuseum Joanneum archives containing numerous documents from the Slovenian Styria.A symposium on the relation of Graz and the Slovenes was held in Graz in 2010, at the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the first and oldest chair of Slovene. It was established at the Lyzeum of Graz in July 1811 on the initiative of Janez Nepomuk Primic. A collection of lectures on the topic was published. The Slovenian Post commemorated the anniversary with a stamp.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nFor the year that Graz was Cultural Capital of Europe, new structures were erected. The Graz Museum of Contemporary Art (German: Kunsthaus) was designed by Peter Cook and Colin Fournier and is situated next to the Mur river. The Island in the Mur is a floating platform made of steel. It was designed by American architect Vito Acconci and contains a caf\u00e9, an open-air theatre and a playground.\n\n\n=== Historic city centre ===\n\nThe historic centre was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999 due to the harmonious co-existence of typical buildings from different epochs and in different architectural styles. Situated in a cultural borderland between Central Europe, Italy and the Balkan States, Graz absorbed various influences from the neighbouring regions and thus received its exceptional townscape. Today the historic centre consists of over 1,000 buildings, their age ranging from Gothic to contemporary.\nThe most important sights in the historic centre are:\n\nTown Hall (Rathaus).\nThe Castle hill (German: Schlossberg), a hill dominating the historic centre (475 m (1,558.40 ft) high), site of a demolished fortress, with views over Graz.\nThe Clock Tower (Uhrturm) is a symbol of Graz, at the top of the Castle hill.\nThe New Gallery (Neue Galerie), a museum of art.\nThe Castle hill funicular (Schlossbergbahn), a funicular railway on the Castle hill's slope.\nThe seat of Styria's provincial parliament (Landhaus), a palace in Lombardic style.

It features the oldest painted view of Graz.\nThe mausoleum of Emperor Ferdinand II next to the cathedral, the most important building of Mannerism in Graz. It includes both the grave where Ferdinand II and his wife are buried, and a church dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria.\nThe Castle (Burg), with Gothic double staircase, built between 1438 and 1453 by Emperor Frederick III, because the old castle on the Schlossberg hill was too small and uncomfortable. The castle remained the residence of the Inner Austrian Court until 1619. Today, it serves as residence for the Styrian government.\nThe Painted House (Gemaltes Haus) in Herrengasse 3. It is completely covered with frescos (painted in 1742 by Johann Mayer).\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art Graz (Kunsthaus)\nThe Island in the Mur (Murinsel), an artificial island in the Mur river.\nBuildings, inner courtyards (e. g.

In the outer districts buildings are predominantly of the architectural styles from the second half of the 20th century.\nIn 1965 the Grazer Schule (School of Graz) was founded. Several buildings around the universities are of this style, for example the green houses by Volker Giencke and the RESOWI center by G\u00fcnther Domenig.\nBefore Graz became the European Capital of Culture in 2003, several new projects were realized, such as the Stadthalle, the Kindermuseum (museum for children), the Helmut-List-Halle, the Kunsthaus and the Murinsel.\n\nTallest buildings\nBuildings in Graz which are at least 50m tall: \n\n\n=== Sports ===\nSK Sturm Graz is the main football club of the city, with three Austrian championships and five runner-up seasons.

Events have been held at different venues in Graz and in the surrounding region.\n\n\n=== Dialect ===\nReferred to as Steirisch by locals, Graz belongs to the Austro-Bavarian region of dialects, more specifically a mix of Central Bavarian in the western part of Styria and Southern Bavarian in the eastern part. The Grazer ORF, the Graz subsidiary of Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, launched an initiative in 2008 called Scho wieda Steirisch g'redt in order to highlight the numerous dialects of Graz and Styria in general and to cultivate the pride many Styrians hold for their local culture. Two reasons for a melding of these dialects with Standard German: the influence of television and radio bringing Standard German into the home and the industrialization causing the disappearance of the single farmer since the farming communities are seen as the true keepers of dialect speaking.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nAn extensive public transport network makes Graz an easy city to navigate without a car. The city has a comprehensive bus network, complementing the Graz tram network consisting of eight lines. Four lines pass through the underground tram stop at the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof) and on to the city centre before branching out. Furthermore, there are seven night-time bus routes, although these run only at weekends and on evenings preceding public holidays.\nThe Schlossbergbahn, a funicular railway, and the Schlossberg lift, a vertical lift, link the city centre to the Schlossberg.\nFrom the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), regional trains link to most of Styria. Direct trains run to most major cities nearby including Vienna, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Maribor and Ljubljana in Slovenia, Zagreb in Croatia, Budapest in Hungary, Prague and Brno in the Czech Republic, Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland, as well as Munich, Stuttgart, Heidelberg, and Frankfurt in Germany. Trains for Vienna leave every hour. In recent years many railway stations within the city limits and in the suburbs have been rebuilt or modernised and are now part of the \"S-Bahn Graz\", a commuter train service connecting the city with its suburban area and towns nearby.\nGraz airport is located about 10 km (6 mi) south of the city centre and is accessible by bus, railway, and car. Direct destinations include Amsterdam, Berlin, D\u00fcsseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart, Istanbul, Vienna and Zurich.\n\n\n== Health ==\nIn Graz there are seven hospitals, several private hospitals and sanatoriums, as well as 44 pharmacies.\nThe University Hospital Graz (LKH-Universit\u00e4ts-Klinikum Graz) is located in eastern Graz and has 1,556 beds and 7,190 employees. The Regional Hospital Graz II (LKH Graz II) has two sites in Graz. The western site (LKH Graz II Standort West) is located in Eggenberg and has 280 beds and about 500 employees, the southern site (LKH Graz II Standort S\u00fcd) specializes in neurology and psychiatry and is located in Stra\u00dfgang with 880 beds and 1,100 employees.

Furthermore, several non-emergency ambulances (KTW \u2013 Krankentransportwagen) and a Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) are operated by the Red Cross to transport non-emergency patients to and between hospitals. In addition to the Red Cross, the Labourers'-Samaritan-Alliance (Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund \u00d6sterreichs), the Austrian organisation of the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps (Malteser Hospitaldienst Austria) and the Green Cross (Gr\u00fcnes Kreuz) operate ambulances (KTW) for non-emergency patient transport. In addition to the cars, there's also the C12 air ambulance helicopter stationed at Graz airport, staffed with an emergency physician in addition to regular personnel.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nGraz is twinned with:\n\nOther forms of cooperation and city friendship similar to the twin city programmes\n Ni\u0161, Serbia\n Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nThe following are past and present notable residents of Graz.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Austria portal\nList of World Heritage Sites in Austria\nKastner & \u00d6hler\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"Graz: Stadtplanung und Stadtentwicklung (Rechnungshofbericht, 2006) in German\" (PDF). 2006.

        "wiki": "Eggenberg Palace (German: Schloss Eggenberg) in Graz, is the most significant Baroque palace complex in the Austrian province of Styria. With its preserved accouterments, the extensive scenic gardens, as well as some special collections from the Universalmuseum Joanneum housed in the palace and surrounding park, Schloss Eggenberg ranks among the most valuable cultural treasures of Austria. Eggenberg Palace is situated at an elevation of 381 meters on the Western edge of the city. Its architectural design and the still visible imprint of centuries of history continue to bear witness to the vicissitude and patronage of the one-time mightiest dynasty in Styria, the House of Eggenberg.\nIn 2010, the significance of Schloss Eggenberg was recognized with an expansion to the listing of the Graz Historic Old Town among the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Sites.\nSurrounded by walls, with a huge portal facing West, the palace is located in the Eggenberg district of Graz and can be reached by tram line. The northern corner of the palace grounds features the Planetary Garden and Lapidarium of Roman stonework as well as the entrance to the new Archeology Museum,[1] which houses the Cult Wagon of Strettweg. At ground level, the palace houses a numismatic collection (Coin Cabinet) located in the former rooms of Balthasar Eggenberger, owner of the imperial minting license and operations in the Late Middle Ages. On the upper level, the Alte Galerie encompasses a large array of paintings, sculptures, and other works of art from the medieval era through the early modern period, spanning five centuries of European art history.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nAt first glance, Schloss Eggenberg presents itself as a uniform, new construction of the 17th century. Nevertheless, large portions of the building date back to the Late Middle Ages and construction continued throughout the early modern era.\nBefore 1460 Balthasar Eggenberger, financier to Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, bought property in the west of Graz which became a fixed noble residence in the family name.  In the subsequent years the family residence was constructed and expanded.  By 1470, a square Gothic chapel had been constructed in the tower.  A Papal indulgence from 30 May 1470 refers to the \u201cCapella Beate Marie Virginis Sita In Castro Eckenperg\u201d, the Chapel of the Virgin Mary in Eggenberg Castle, which became the nucleus of the new palace built by Balthasar's great-grandson, Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg.The younger cousin of General Ruprecht von Eggenberg, Hans Ulrich, as a superb diplomat and statesman, steered the foreign policy of his Emperor, Ferdinand II, while Eggenberg\u2019s counterpart and political adversary,  Cardinal Richelieu of France, guided that of King Louis XIII during Thirty Years War.  As prime minister (in contemporary political jargon) and close, personal confidant of Ferdinand II, Hans Ulrich wanted a grandiose residence representing his new status and authority when he was named \"Gubernator\" (Governor) of Inner Austria after the emperor chose Vienna as his imperial capital.  In 1625 Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg commissioned court architect Giovanni Pietro de Pomis with the planning of his new palace, inspired by El Escorial in Spain. As an architect, painter, and medailleur (designer and minter of medals), de Pomis, originally from Lodi near Milan, became the most important artist at the Grazer court. Incorporating the original medieval family residence into the new palace, de Pomis himself oversaw the construction work up to his death in 1631. Fortress master builder Laurenz van de Syppe continued the work for two years until the building was finished, in the end, by both of de Pomis\u2019 site foremen, Pietro Valnegro and Antonio Pozzo. The shell appears to have been completed by 1635 or 1636. Between 1641 and 1646 work on the ornamentation was brought to a close.\nBeginning in 1666, Johann Seyfried von Eggenberg, grandson of Hans Ulrich, developed the palace according to the splendor and grandeur of the Baroque style and in 1673 the residence again entered the limelight as Archduchess Claudia Felicitas of Tyrol was a guest in the palace on the occasion of her wedding in Graz to Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor.  Under Prince Johann Seyfried, the comprehensive cycle of ceiling coverings of approximately 600 paintings in the rooms of the piano nobile was accomplished in just 7 years. Hans Adam Weissenkircher began his service as the court painter of the princely Eggenberger court in 1678. He finished the painting cycle of the main festival hall, the famous Planetary Room, in 1684/85. With this, the first phase of accouterment work on Schloss Eggenberg was completed.\nAfter the extinction of the male line of the Eggenberg family, the Eggenberger state rooms were left in a half-emptied and neglected state. The husband of the last Eggenberger princess, Johann Leopold Count Herberstein, ordered a comprehensive renewal of the complex.  Between 1754 and 1762 the building and the garden underwent their second major phase of ornamentation, this time in complete accordance with the tastes of the Rococo. Above all, the accouterment of the piano nobile was modernized. Nevertheless, the Planetary Room and the entire cycle of ceiling paintings remained almost unchanged. Thus, the works limited themselves to wall decorations, stoves and pieces of furniture. In keeping with the taste of the times, three East Asian cabinets were introduced and the state rooms received new wall coverings. The most extensive change was probably the demolition of the Eggenberger palace theater, in the place of which a baroque palace church was established. The supervisor of these works was the Grazer court architect Joseph Hueber, a student of Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt.\nThe third phase of the changes came during the 19th century and was limited to the living quarters on the 1st storey (2nd floor in American English) of the palace. The piano nobile remained untouched and unused for a full century. The primary focus of attention of this period was the total transformation of the Baroque formal garden into a romantic landscape garden after the English fashion.\nThe entire complex remained in the possession of the Herberstein family up to 1939. Shortly before the war, Schloss Eggenberg was acquired with the park by the state of Styria. The oldest museum in Austria, the Joanneum, which was established on 26 November 1811 by Archduke Johann of Austria, took over management of the palace and park. The Joanneum conducted extensive restoration work to repair the damage that occurred during World War II and the subsequent occupation by the Allies and in 1953 Schloss Eggenberg and the Eggenberg Schloss Park were finally opened again to the public.\n\n\n=== Scheme ===\n\nWith his new residence, Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg, the mental inspiration behind the complex program, realized an architectural concept deeply influenced by the humanist notions of magic as the praxis of natural philosophy and of the rational order of the world. Above all, astronomy, astrology and alchemy were major components of the education of a worldly prince. In addition to representing the prince\u2019s new rank, all these aspects flowed into the vision of the new building as a symbol of the cosmos as a well-organized, hierarchical, logico-mathematically explicable system.\nSchloss Eggenberg relies on the Gregorian calendar as a basis for this constructed universe. The palace has 365 exterior windows, one for each day of the year.  Of these, 52 are on the 24 rooms of the piano nobile representing the weeks of one year.  The 2nd storey contains these 24 state rooms in a ring-shaped arrangement which symbolize the hours in a single day. Every floor in the building bares exactly 31 rooms counting the maximum number of days in a calendar month.  The 52 windows of the piano nobile with the 8 windows of the Planetary Room make a total of 60, representing both the number of seconds in a minute and the minutes in an hour.\nThe palace is erected on a rectangular plan with the geometrical center being formed by the middle tower with its Gothic chapel. On each corner there is a tower-like rise. Each of these corner-towers represents one of the four seasons and the outside corner of each is aimed exactly in a cardinal direction.\n\n\n=== Planetary Room ===\n\nThe cycle of 24 state rooms culminates in the main festival hall, the Planetary Room and serves as both the beginning and the end of the ring of state rooms. The cycle of the oil paintings in this hall was created by Hans Adam Weissenkircher and displays the four elements, the 12 signs of the Western zodiac and of course the seven classical \u201cplanets\u201d (planetes asteres: wandering stars) known to Antiquity.  The cycle of paintings by Weissenkircher melds the architectural program with the ornamentation of the palace thereby achieving an allegory of the \"Golden Age\" ruled over by the House of Eggenberg.\n\n\n=== Piano nobile ===\n\nThe cycle of some 600 ceiling paintings in the 24 state rooms of the piano nobile recalls the history of the world with scenes from Greek and Roman mythology, religious scenes from the Old Testament, and historical legends from Western Europe. This ceiling program with its stucco framing dates back to the first period of accouterment in the 17th century.\nUnder the married couple Eggenberg-Herberstein, the 24 rooms of the piano nobile were refurbished according to the tastes of the Rococo starting in the mid-18th century. In addition to new pieces of furniture, chandeliers and sconces, and high-quality fa\u00efence stoves, nearly all the rooms also received brand-new, monochrome silk damask wall coverings. Five rooms in the north tract of the piano nobile were equipped with large painted canvasses. Styrian artist Johann Anton Baptist Raunacher dedicated each room to a different subject; shepherd's games, theatrical scenes and gambling scenes are found alongside society scenes and hunting scenes in Schloss Eggenberg. It was during this phase that the Eggenberg palace theater was converted into a palace church in the Baroque style. In addition, three exquisite East Asian cabinets were integrated into the sequence of rooms. The first two are adorned with valuable Imari porcelain plates and bowls as well as Chinese silk paintings. In the wall coverings of the third cabinet, eight panels of a precious Japanese folding screen have been used. These traditional dividers portray the palace and the fortified town of Osaka before 1615, whereby it can be determined that these panels were executed shortly thereafter. From the early modern era there are very few of these screens depicting the city before its destruction, so these works are especially noteworthy. On account of the viewpoint on Osaka the Eggenberg panels represent a unique exhibit.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Gardens ==\nThe various owners and builder-owners have always looked at the palace and at the surrounding gardens as corresponding elements. Thus, every succeeding generation has carried out significant alterations.\n\nThe largest expansion of the garden occurred after the completion of the house. In the last third of the 17th century the garden was generously extended around the building. It followed the pattern of the strictly subdivided Italian garden, with parterres, bosquet areas, fountains, aviaries and pheasant gardens.\nJohann Leopold Count Herberstein allowed the whole arrangement to be reshaped into a French garden. As early as the 1770s, the Eggenberg Gardens were an attraction open to the Grazer public.\n\nHowever, with the advent of the Enlightenment and the liberalization of ideas under Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, by the end of the 18th century, it was thought that Baroque gardens were ugly; having a pruned nature constricted by too stringent norms. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Count Herberstein, as a fanatical garden lover, partook of this perspective and in 1802 prompted the stylish transformation of the Eggenberg Schloss Park into a picturesque English garden.  Labyrinths, fountains, straight paths and hierarchical patterns all had to give way to the call to \"return to nature\" in the sense of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.   Apart from the straight entrance way, which was preserved, the goal was to create artificial vistas with the new, winding pathways and the illusion of being in an Arcadian landscape painting such as those of Claude Lorraine whose works inspired the likes of Stourhead as well as many others.  The recently restored Rose Mound formed the climax of this 19th-century landscape park.\nThe early 20th century saw a dwindling of interest in the palace gardens and the Eggenberg Schloss Park no longer employed a gardener. This had the unfortunate consequences of individual elements of the garden being torn-out and, over the course of decades, the rest being overgrown; the entire arrangement thus becoming more or less a simple city park.\n\nIn 1993, in cooperation with the Austrian Federal Bureau of Cultural Heritage Management (Bundesdenkmalamt), a garden grooming project was begun with the goals of preserving and reconstructing the gardens as a cultural monument to Romanticism. The still existing elements were to be made recognizable and protected and the lost elements reconstructed in so far as it was possible. The initial phases of this project that have already been completed are the reconstruction of the 1848 Breakfast Garden behind the palace and the reclamation and restoration, which occurred during the winter months of 2007/08, of the Rose Mound, one of the most important components of the romantic English landscape garden.\nAdditionally, the peacocks from the Graz Peacock Garden formerly located between the inner city and the city park have found a new home in the Eggenberg Schloss Park.  The species are of both the white variety and the more common Indian blue peacock.  During mating season, the loud cawing of the males as well as their brilliant plumage adds an exotic flair to the splendor of the park as they try to attract the larger but less colorful females.\n\n\n=== Planetary Garden ===\nIn the north corner of the grounds, an enclosed, separate garden went through such diverse transformations and uses over the course of the palace history that in the end it was discernible only by the spatial structure. Due to a lack of surviving records, a new design for the flower garden was decided on in 2000 and a new garden grew out of an old idea. Landscape architect Helga Tornquist took up the theme of the Eggenberg scheme and incorporated it into a contemporary garden creation. This reclamation takes up in a playful fashion the ancient system of planetary \u201csignatures\u201d, which is of special significance for the iconography of Schloss Eggenberg.  The Lapidarium has been established over the foundations of the former orangery as a point of interest and to provide an appropriate setting for the Roman Stonework Collection of the Joanneum.\nSchloss Eggenberg enters the 21st century with the opening of a newly constructed subterranean showroom adjoined to the Lapidarium to house the Joanneum's Pre- and Early History archaeological Collections in autumn of 2009 to be ready for the Joanneum\u2019s bicentennial celebration in 2011.\n\n\n== Commemorative silver euro coin ==\nIn 2002, the Austrian Mint honored the importance of Schloss Eggenberg, by using it as the main motif of one of its most popular silver euro commemorative coins: the 10 euro Eggenberg Palace commemorative coin.  The reverse side shows an image of Johannes Kepler, a personal acquaintance of Eggenberg\u2019s who taught at the former Protestant school in Graz.  His first major work, Mysterium Cosmographicum describing the Copernican system, written while he was still in Graz, likely influenced the symbolism of the design of the palace.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Baroque residences\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nDas Joanneum \u2013 \u00d6sterreichs Universalmuseum [documentary film DVD] By G\u00fcnther Schilhan (director) & Helmut Gesslbauer (producer), Austria: ORF Steiermark, 2006.

          "We visited this place on the weekend and it was a day well spent.There were plenty of interesting vegetation to admire and there were benches to sit and relax. Children could play in the playground.",
          "Beautiful gardens and layout, lovely castle with interesting history and nuance. We were very entertained by the peacocks around the area.",
          "Surprisingly beautiful art! Well kept rooms giving you a glimpse of life in different time periods. There is not much furniture but the wall decoration is amazing . The guided tour was very informative . Make sure you also get a ticket for the museum. Beautiful really ld",
          "The gardens are beautiful and the peacocks are an added bonus. We took an English tour to see the state rooms and our guide was wonderful! She obviously love what she was doing and this really came through in the information that she shared with us. What a gem this palace is!",
          "Admission fees are paid separately for the garden and the guided tour to the State Rooms. If you are not a castle person, the garden is still worth a visit especially for younger kids with well maintained grass to run around and quite a few peacocks wandering around. The tour",
          "The grounds are tranquil and apparently enjoyed by locals. They're all very well maintained and beautiful. Would have loved to see the rose garden in bloom! The room tour was wonderful. You tour the entire third floor, moving from room to room. It's also a bit more allowing of",
          "By taking the tram 1 to Schloss Eggenburg stop, you are a short walk to the entrance. Nicely kept gardens with peacocks and a small pond. Unfortunately the castle opens in April, so we had to be satisfied with what we saw on the outside if the buildings.",
          "The city and country views from this location are breathtaking. Be sure to note that the hands on the clock tower are reversed with the long hand indicating the hour and the short, the minute. It is a rather long hike down via the stairs so if you need to, ride the funicular",
          "It was disappointing not to see the State rooms but you can wander the cloisters and the grounds are very pleasant.",
          "The Number 1 Tram takes you with two blocks of this Palace. The museums open April 1st, but the impressive gardens with strolling peacocks is open year-round. A lovely walk in the park even for late winter.",
          "This is more a problem with Google Maps navigation--but it leads you to the side which isn't the entrance. I walked 3 sides around and gave up because I was running out of time (yes, I'm sure it was on the side I didn't go to). Annoying and a waste of time if they haven't",
          "The gardens of the castle alone are worth a visit, I was there in summer so everything was in full bloom. There's a lovely rose garden on a hill with botanical descriptions and big old trees to hug. Outside the perfect balance of a kept garden and some pure nature. The castle is",
          "I have taken the tour of this luxurious palace twice and walked it's sprawling and well-manicured gardens four times. It is well worth the ticket price to take the full tour. It seems to be an underrated gem of Austrian heritage.Take two flights of the stairs to the beginning of",
          "If you are looking for some peace and nature do not miss this park, very calm and peaceful. Located 15 minutes by tram from the train station. A must when You are in Graz.",
          "We got there for a walk, but it was not as we expected. I know it was a winter day but it did not give us reason to pay 2\u20ac per person to visit the gardens. The schloss was closed. Maybe in the summer/spring things are different.",
          "I visited when the palace museum was closed, but enjoyed walking around the park very much to see natural beauty. There were quite a lot of peacocks around, and I've never seen such amazing colours on a bird! Definitely would want to visit again to see the interior next time.",
          "I do not know which is better, the Schloss, or the park/gardens surrounding it. The Schloss defies normal description, with its mathematical precision of towers, windows etc. conforming to the calendar. The park is a paradise with the added delight of the multitude of peacocks",
          "When in Graz, this is a must-see place: if you take the guided visit in the state rooms of the palace, the history of the place and the power games come alive. This is not the most glamorous palace you could see, but you get a glimpse of the history of the area.",
          "Very nice castle with an interesting history to learn about. You really have to take the guided tour in order to experience what this place is about. The rooms are incredible and to imagine them with the candles lit is intriguing. Definitely worth it.",
          "Visited the palace and the gardens. Beautiful landscaped gardens, lots of lovely trees. Kids play area. 2 euro if you just want the garden. The castle is amazing inside. The artwork on the ceilings and walls is so well preserved. Had a great guide who explained the history. Alot",
          "We've only seen the park, not the palace and we liked it, but I must say that I expected a bit more. It's a nice walk, but not much more than that. We visited with a family and the playground is so so, the flower arrangements are nothing special, even the peacocks are a bit sad",
          "We took the guided tour. The variety and the insight into the history of this castle was fantastic. It took around 90 Minutes and we could have stayed a day. So much to see, from decoration to paintings to furniture. The tour around the first floor, the ground floor is still",
          "Take the number 1 tram to the end stop, a short walk to the Schloss. Lovely park, only 2 euros each. We spent a relaxing hour or so walking around, coffee and cake in the friendly caf\u00e9. We didn't go into the Schloss, maybe next time.",
          "Three collections share the Schloss, the Old Masters gallery, the archaeological collection and the coin cabinet. It is situated in a park overlooking the town of Graz, take a tram from the central station to get there. Their main collection is the old Masters gallery. Some",
          "a great park with special roses, the guided tour in the castle was perfect, learned a lot about Austrian history",
          "Schloss Eggenberg is UNESCO World Heritage site. Like at all UNESCO sites, there is a ticket for walk in the park and another for castle tour. There is a lovely picnic area in the park where you can relax and a big chance that a peacock will stop in for a cup of tea.",
          "My partner i loved the outdoor park which costs 2 euro per adult to enter. Though manicured as part of the estate, it's great for picnics, strolling around and just listening the wind blow through. A one hour guided tour that costs 9.50 euro per adult, gives a good overall",
          "The tour guider made very good introduction about the palace which is full of interesting royal & nobel stories.",
          "Very interesting history and lots of meaningful art inside from artists of various countries.. Great chapel inside..",
          "It's a very nice place, all around a lot of beautiful flowers and nice arraged gardens! And a lot of peafowl.",
          "We brought 30 university students here in May. Fabulous tour. What is most incredible, besides the grounds/gardens, is the 2nd floor that went untouched/unlived in for 150 years!!! The paintings and frescos are beautiful and the furniture original. The story is quite",
          "This palace on the edge of town is worth making the effort to visit, which must be seen with a guided tour. Our guide was outstanding in her presentation, giving a lot of background about the various rooms we visited. There are a few tours in English, but it is hard to come by",
          "The castle itself is well preserved and interesting (we had a great English speaking guide). The park surrounding it is lovely. However the best part for me were the many peacocks. The peacocks run in and out of the castle, posing on benches, walls and window ledges and",
          "Easily accessible on the train via a short walk. The grounds are gorgeous & the palace itself was amazing! Information in english is available if you're touring any of the museums and need some 'help.'",
          "This beautiful schloss and gardens is worth visiting if only to see all the peacocks and hear their unusual calls. The gardens are beautiful as us the schloss itself and the trees are gnarly and unusual too",
          "This was a fascinating place. The Eggenberg family in the 17th century decided to portray on their ceilings the history of the world (including mythology), They chose to represent themselves as enlightened princes by creating a ponderous architectural calendar scheme where there",
          "Took tram 1 here on monday but sadly palace was closed. Cost 2 euro to get into park.Lovely for walks on a nice day.Very big park",
          "We visited this castle on April 2. We had a guided tour in English, it lasted one hour. The architecture of the palace is wonderful, all paintings are beautiful. Money museum is interesting. Price is reasonable. Must be very nice in summer when you can enjoy the gardens. We can",
          "What a treat! Architecture, atmosphere, history, culture - all coming together. And a first-class guided tour: our guide was competent, focused, friendly - just perfect. Reasonably priced tickets, including paintings gallery and money museum. In short: a MUST in Graz!",
          "It had been years since I had been to Schloss Eggenberg and was pleasantly surprised to find that there are now extra tours in English which are interesting and informative. The palace itself is a treasure trove and highly recommendable. In addition, the 'Alte Galerie' museum is",

          "This was pretty fascinating (I had the guided tour). The docents are very knowledgeable (tours available in both English or German) and provide a lot of information about the rooms. Well worth it to see all of the art and hear how the rooms were used. The coin museum is in",
          "There are lots of chateaux and palaces in Austria, but this one is a bit different. It is built in the 'calendar' style with 365 windows, 52 of them on the 24 state rooms, and so on. Most of the second floor remains decorated as it was in the 18th century, and the guided tour,",

          "Definitely a must if you are in Graz. The gardens are not to be missed. They are just so lovely with peacocks wondering around.",
          "The old castle is very impressive and well maintained, loved to meander in the castle park, the official rooms are beautiful and if I remember correctly there are 365 windows in the castle",
          "We bicycled to Eggenberger from our hotel near the old town in Graz. The roads to this location were a bit tricky, but the locals were very helpful. The grounds and surrounding area are beautiful with forested scenery and farmland on the way there. This was another historic",

          "Beautiful gardens, amazing painting pictures, huge rooms are only a few aspect of this very interesting place. The guide explain you the whole history of the Palace, therefore I fully recommend to go for the pay tour, don't stay only in the gardens or you gonna miss several",
          "The tour through the State Rooms are well worth the price. The Alte Gallery was also very good. The archaeology museum was a little weak, especially if you have visited other collections. If you collect coins, the collection there is a must-see. If time permits, a walk through",

          "This is a baroque palace, make no mistake. But it still looks and feels as though a family owns it and has used it. In good, cared-for condition but feels and looks as though the pictures ,furniture etc have not been planted for effect. Overall, a very positive experience.",
          "A must when You are in Graz. Castle with its garden is easy accessible from the centre of Graz. Take the tram no1 and it will lead You to the gate. Unfortunately only the group tour is allowed and it can be a bit boring. While waiting your tour there is a small cafe in the",

        "wiki": "Graz ( GRAHTS, German: [\u0261\u0281a\u02d0ts] (listen); Slovene: Gradec) is the capital city of Styria and Austria's second-largest city after Vienna. As of 1 January 2019, Graz had a population of 328,276 (292,269 of whom had principal-residence status). In 2015, the population of the Graz larger urban zone (LUZ) stood at 633,168, based on principal-residence status. Graz has a long tradition as a seat of higher education. It has four colleges and four universities with more than 60,000 students. Its historic centre  (Altstadt) is one of the best-preserved city centres in Central Europe.For centuries, Graz was more important to Slovenes and Croats, both politically and culturally, than the capitals of Ljubljana, Slovenia and Zagreb, Croatia; it remains influential to this day. In 1999, the city's historic centre was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites and in 2010 the designation was expanded to include Eggenberg Palace (German: Schloss Eggenberg) on the western edge of the city. Graz was designated the Cultural Capital of Europe in 2003 and became a City of Culinary Delights in 2008.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name of the city, Graz, formerly spelled Gratz, most likely stems from the Slavic gradec, which means \"small castle\". Some archaeological finds point to the erection of a small castle by Alpine Slavic people, which over time became a heavily defended fortification. In literary Slovene and Croatian, gradec still means \"small castle\", forming a hypocoristic derivative of Proto-West-South Slavic *grad\u044cc\u044a, whichs descends via liquid metathesis from Common Slavic *gard\u044cc\u044a and via the Slavic third palatalisation from Proto-Slavic *gardiku, originally denoting \"small town, settlement\". The name thus follows the common South Slavic pattern for naming settlements as grad. The German name 'Graz' first appears in records in 1128.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGraz is situated on both sides of the Mur river in southeast Austria. It is about 200 km (120 mi) southwest of Vienna (Wien). The nearest larger urban centre is Maribor (Marburg) in Slovenia, which is about 50 km (31 mi) to the south. Graz is the state capital and largest city in Styria, a green and heavily forested region on the eastern edge of the Alps.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring municipalities ===\nThese towns and villages border Graz:\n\nto the north: Gratkorn, Stattegg, Weinitzen\nto the east: Kainbach bei Graz, Hart bei Graz, Raaba\nto the south: G\u00f6ssendorf, Feldkirchen bei Graz, Seiersberg\nto the west: Attendorf, Thal, Judendorf-Stra\u00dfengel\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nGraz is divided into 17 municipal districts (Stadtbezirke):\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement on the ground of the modern city of Graz dates back to the Copper Age. However, no historical continuity exists of a settlement before the Middle Ages.\nDuring the 12th century, dukes under Babenberg rule made the town into an important commercial center. Later, Graz came under the rule of the Habsburgs and, in 1281, gained special privileges from King Rudolph I.\nIn the 14th century, Graz became the city of residence of the Inner Austrian line of the Habsburgs. The royalty lived in the Schlossberg castle and from there ruled Styria, Carinthia, most of today's Slovenia, and parts of Italy (Carniola, Gorizia and Gradisca, Trieste).\nIn the 16th century, the city's design and planning were primarily controlled by Italian Renaissance architects and artists. One of the most famous buildings representative of this style is the Landhaus, designed by Domenico dell'Allio, and used by the local rulers as a governmental headquarters.\n\nThe University of Graz was founded by Archduke Karl II in 1585, it's the city's oldest university. For most of its existence, it was controlled by the Catholic church, and was closed in 1782 by Joseph II in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a lyceum where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-established as a university by Emperor Franz I, and was named 'Karl-Franzens Universit\u00e4t' or 'Charles-Francis University' in English. More than 30,000 students are currently enrolled at this university.\nThe astronomer Johannes Kepler lived in Graz for a short period. He worked as a math teacher and was a professor of mathematics at the University of Graz, but still found time to study astronomy. He left Graz for Prague when Lutherans were banned from the city.\nLudwig Boltzmann was Professor for Mathematical Physics from 1869 to 1890. During that time, Nikola Tesla studied electrical engineering at the Polytechnic in 1875. Nobel Laureate Otto Loewi taught at the University of Graz from 1909 until 1938. Ivo Andric, the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature Laureate obtained his doctorate at the University of Graz. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger was briefly chancellor of the University of Graz in 1936.\nGraz is centrally located within today's Bundesland (state) of Styria, or Steiermark in German. Mark is an old German word indicating a large area of land used as a defensive border, in which the peasantry is taught how to organize and fight in the case of an invasion. With a strategic location at the head of the open and fertile Mur valley, Graz was historically a target of invaders, such as the Hungarians under Matthias Corvinus in 1481, and the Ottoman Turks in 1529 and 1532. Apart from the Riegersburg Castle, the Schlossberg was the only fortification in the region that never fell to the Ottoman Turks. Graz is home to the region's provincial armory, which is the world's largest historical collection of late medieval and Renaissance weaponry. It has been preserved since 1551, and displays over 30,000 items.\nFrom the earlier part of the 15th century, Graz was the residence of the younger branch of the Habsburgs, which succeeded to the imperial throne in 1619 in the person of Emperor Ferdinand II, who moved the capital to Vienna. New fortifications were built on the Schlossberg at the end of the 16th century. Napoleon's army occupied Graz in 1797. In 1809, the city withstood another assault by the French army. During this attack, the commanding officer in the fortress was ordered to defend it with about 900 men against Napoleon's army of about 3,000. He successfully defended the Schlossberg against eight attacks, but they were forced to give up after the Grande Arm\u00e9e occupied Vienna and the Emperor ordered to surrender. Following the defeat of Austria by Napoleonic forces at the Battle of Wagram in 1809, the fortifications were demolished using explosives, as stipulated in the Peace of Sch\u00f6nbrunn of the same year. The belltower (Glockenturm) and the civic clock tower (Uhrturm), which is a leading tourist attraction and serves as a symbol for Graz, were spared after the citizens of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation.Archduke Karl II of Inner Austria had 20,000 Protestant books burned in the square of what is now a mental hospital, and succeeded in returning Styria to the authority of the Holy See. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was born in Graz in what is now the Stadtmuseum (city museum).\n\n\n== Population development ==\nThe more recent population figures do not give the whole picture as only people with principal-residence status are counted and people with secondary residence status are not. Most of the people with secondary residence status in Graz are students. At the end of 2016 there were 33,473 people with secondary residence status in Graz.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nOceanic climate is the type found in the city, but due to the 0 \u00b0C isotherm, the same occurs in a humid continental climate with based in K\u00f6ppen system (Cfb/Dfb borderline). Wladimir K\u00f6ppen himself was in town and conducted studies to see how the climate of the past influenced the Continental Drift theory. Due to its position southeast of the Alps, Graz is shielded from the prevailing westerly winds that bring weather fronts in from the North Atlantic to northwestern and central Europe. The weather in Graz is thus influenced by the Mediterranean, and it has more hours of sunshine per year than Vienna or Salzburg and also less wind or rain. Graz lies in a basin that is only open to the south, causing the climate to be warmer than would be expected at that latitude. Plants are found in Graz that normally grow much further south.\n\naverage temperatures: Graz Airport 8.7 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) / Karl-Franzens University 9.4 \u00b0C (49 \u00b0F)\naverage rainfall: 818 mm (32 in) with on average 92 days of rain (Karl Franzens University)\naverage hours of sunshine: 1,989 (Karl Franzens University)\n\n\n== Slovenes and Graz ==\nPolitically, culturally, scientifically and religiously, Graz was an important centre for all Slovenes, especially from the establishment of the University of Graz in 1586 until the establishment of University of Ljubljana in 1919. In 1574, the first Slovene Catholic book was published in Graz, and in 1592, Hieronymus Megiser published in Graz the book Dictionarium quatuor linguarum, the first multilingual dictionary of Slovene.The Styrian Slovenes did not consider Graz a German-speaking city, but their own, a place to study while living at their relatives' homes and to fulfill one's career ambitions. The student associations in Graz were a crucible of the Slovene identity, and the Slovene students in Graz were more nationally aware than some others. This led to fierce anti-Slovene efforts of German-speaking nationalists in Graz before and during World War II.Many Slovenian Styrians study there. Slovenes are among the professors at the Institute for Jazz in Graz. Numerous Slovenes have found employment there, while being formerly unemployed in Slovenia. For the Slovene culture, Graz remains permanently important due to its university and the Universalmuseum Joanneum archives containing numerous documents from the Slovenian Styria.A symposium on the relation of Graz and the Slovenes was held in Graz in 2010, at the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the first and oldest chair of Slovene. It was established at the Lyzeum of Graz in July 1811 on the initiative of Janez Nepomuk Primic. A collection of lectures on the topic was published. The Slovenian Post commemorated the anniversary with a stamp.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nFor the year that Graz was Cultural Capital of Europe, new structures were erected. The Graz Museum of Contemporary Art (German: Kunsthaus) was designed by Peter Cook and Colin Fournier and is situated next to the Mur river. The Island in the Mur is a floating platform made of steel. It was designed by American architect Vito Acconci and contains a caf\u00e9, an open-air theatre and a playground.\n\n\n=== Historic city centre ===\n\nThe historic centre was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999 due to the harmonious co-existence of typical buildings from different epochs and in different architectural styles. Situated in a cultural borderland between Central Europe, Italy and the Balkan States, Graz absorbed various influences from the neighbouring regions and thus received its exceptional townscape. Today the historic centre consists of over 1,000 buildings, their age ranging from Gothic to contemporary.\nThe most important sights in the historic centre are:\n\nTown Hall (Rathaus).\nThe Castle hill (German: Schlossberg), a hill dominating the historic centre (475 m (1,558.40 ft) high), site of a demolished fortress, with views over Graz.\nThe Clock Tower (Uhrturm) is a symbol of Graz, at the top of the Castle hill.\nThe New Gallery (Neue Galerie), a museum of art.\nThe Castle hill funicular (Schlossbergbahn), a funicular railway on the Castle hill's slope.\nThe seat of Styria's provincial parliament (Landhaus), a palace in Lombardic style. It is one of the most important examples of Renaissance architecture in Austria and was built by Italian architect Domenico dell'Allio between 1557 and 1565.\nThe Armoury (Landeszeughaus) is the largest of its kind in the world.\nThe Graz Opera House (Opernhaus), the principal venue for opera, ballet, and operetta performances. It is the 2nd largest opera house in Austria.\nThe Graz Theatre (Schauspielhaus), Graz's principal theatre for productions of plays.\nThe Cathedral (Dom), a rare monument of Gothic architecture. Once, there were many frescos on the outer walls; today, only a few remain, like the Landplagenbild (\"picture of plagues\") painted in 1485, presumably by Thomas von Villach. The three plagues it depicts are locusts, pestilence and the invasion of the Turks, all of them striking the town in 1480. It features the oldest painted view of Graz.\nThe mausoleum of Emperor Ferdinand II next to the cathedral, the most important building of Mannerism in Graz. It includes both the grave where Ferdinand II and his wife are buried, and a church dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria.\nThe Castle (Burg), with Gothic double staircase, built between 1438 and 1453 by Emperor Frederick III, because the old castle on the Schlossberg hill was too small and uncomfortable. The castle remained the residence of the Inner Austrian Court until 1619. Today, it serves as residence for the Styrian government.\nThe Painted House (Gemaltes Haus) in Herrengasse 3. It is completely covered with frescos (painted in 1742 by Johann Mayer).\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art Graz (Kunsthaus)\nThe Island in the Mur (Murinsel), an artificial island in the Mur river.\nBuildings, inner courtyards (e. g. Early Renaissance courtyard of the Former House of Teutonic Knights in Sporgasse 22) and roofscape of the old town.\n\n\n=== Outside the historic city centre ===\n\nEggenberg Palace (Schloss Eggenberg) a baroque palace on the western edge of Graz with State rooms and museum. In 2010 it was added to the existing World Heritage site of the historic centre of Graz.\nThe Mariatrost Basilica (Basilika Mariatrost) a late Baroque church, on the eastern edge of Graz.\nThe Jesus's Heart Church (Herz-Jesu-Kirche) is the largest church in Graz with the third highest spire in Austria, built in Gothic Revival style.\nThe Calvary Hill (Kalvarienberg) in the G\u00f6sting area of Graz with a 17th-century calvary and church.\nThe Graz University Hospital is the largest hospital in Graz and one of the largest hospitals in Austria. It's the largest Jugendstil building complex in Austria and was built between 1904 and 1912. It's run by the province Styria and is one of the most renowned hospitals in Austria and Central Europe.\nBest viewpoints for vistas of the city are the G\u00f6sting Ruin (Ruine G\u00f6sting), a ruin of a hilltop castle on the city's northwestern edge, and Plabutsch/F\u00fcrstenstand, behind Eggenberg Palace, with a hilltop restaurant and viewing tower.\n\n\n=== Greater Graz area ===\n\u00d6sterreichisches Freilichtmuseum St\u00fcbing, an open-air museum containing old farmhouses/farm buildings from all over Austria reassembled in historic setting.\nLurgrotte, the most extensive cave system in Austria.\nLipizzanergest\u00fct Piber, Lipizzaner stud at Piber where the famous horses are bred.\nThe Steirische Weinstra\u00dfe is a wine-growing region south of Graz, also known as the \"Styrian Tuscany\".\nThermenregion, spa region east of Graz.\nRiegersburg Castle, a mighty fortress that was never taken.

In the outer districts buildings are predominantly of the architectural styles from the second half of the 20th century.\nIn 1965 the Grazer Schule (School of Graz) was founded. Several buildings around the universities are of this style, for example the green houses by Volker Giencke and the RESOWI center by G\u00fcnther Domenig.\nBefore Graz became the European Capital of Culture in 2003, several new projects were realized, such as the Stadthalle, the Kindermuseum (museum for children), the Helmut-List-Halle, the Kunsthaus and the Murinsel.\n\nTallest buildings\nBuildings in Graz which are at least 50m tall: \n\n\n=== Sports ===\nSK Sturm Graz is the main football club of the city, with three Austrian championships and five runner-up seasons. The Grazer AK also won an Austrian championship, but went into administration in 2007 and was excluded from the professional league system.\nIn ice hockey, the ATSE Graz was the Austrian Hockey League champion in 1975 and 1978. The EC Graz was runner-up in 1991\u201392, 1992\u201393 and 1993\u201394.

It's still facing referendum, meaning usually the end for many former olympic bids in Europe and North America since 1970 -century.\n\n\n=== Styriarte ===\nGraz hosts the annual festival of classical music Styriarte, founded in 1985 to tie conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt closer to his hometown. Events have been held at different venues in Graz and in the surrounding region.\n\n\n=== Dialect ===\nReferred to as Steirisch by locals, Graz belongs to the Austro-Bavarian region of dialects, more specifically a mix of Central Bavarian in the western part of Styria and Southern Bavarian in the eastern part. The Grazer ORF, the Graz subsidiary of Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, launched an initiative in 2008 called Scho wieda Steirisch g'redt in order to highlight the numerous dialects of Graz and Styria in general and to cultivate the pride many Styrians hold for their local culture. Two reasons for a melding of these dialects with Standard German: the influence of television and radio bringing Standard German into the home and the industrialization causing the disappearance of the single farmer since the farming communities are seen as the true keepers of dialect speaking.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nAn extensive public transport network makes Graz an easy city to navigate without a car. The city has a comprehensive bus network, complementing the Graz tram network consisting of eight lines. Four lines pass through the underground tram stop at the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof) and on to the city centre before branching out. Furthermore, there are seven night-time bus routes, although these run only at weekends and on evenings preceding public holidays.\nThe Schlossbergbahn, a funicular railway, and the Schlossberg lift, a vertical lift, link the city centre to the Schlossberg.\nFrom the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), regional trains link to most of Styria. Direct trains run to most major cities nearby including Vienna, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Maribor and Ljubljana in Slovenia, Zagreb in Croatia, Budapest in Hungary, Prague and Brno in the Czech Republic, Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland, as well as Munich, Stuttgart, Heidelberg, and Frankfurt in Germany. Trains for Vienna leave every hour. In recent years many railway stations within the city limits and in the suburbs have been rebuilt or modernised and are now part of the \"S-Bahn Graz\", a commuter train service connecting the city with its suburban area and towns nearby.\nGraz airport is located about 10 km (6 mi) south of the city centre and is accessible by bus, railway, and car. Direct destinations include Amsterdam, Berlin, D\u00fcsseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart, Istanbul, Vienna and Zurich.\n\n\n== Health ==\nIn Graz there are seven hospitals, several private hospitals and sanatoriums, as well as 44 pharmacies.\nThe University Hospital Graz (LKH-Universit\u00e4ts-Klinikum Graz) is located in eastern Graz and has 1,556 beds and 7,190 employees. The Regional Hospital Graz II (LKH Graz II) has two sites in Graz. The western site (LKH Graz II Standort West) is located in Eggenberg and has 280 beds and about 500 employees, the southern site (LKH Graz II Standort S\u00fcd) specializes in neurology and psychiatry and is located in Stra\u00dfgang with 880 beds and 1,100 employees.

Perpetually two emergency doctor's cars (NEF \u2013 Notarzteinsatzfahrzeug), two NAWs (Notarztwagen \u2013 ambulances staffed with a physician in addition to regular personnel) and about 30 RTWs (Rettungswagen \u2013 regular ambulances) are on standby. Furthermore, several non-emergency ambulances (KTW \u2013 Krankentransportwagen) and a Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) are operated by the Red Cross to transport non-emergency patients to and between hospitals. In addition to the Red Cross, the Labourers'-Samaritan-Alliance (Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund \u00d6sterreichs), the Austrian organisation of the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps (Malteser Hospitaldienst Austria) and the Green Cross (Gr\u00fcnes Kreuz) operate ambulances (KTW) for non-emergency patient transport. In addition to the cars, there's also the C12 air ambulance helicopter stationed at Graz airport, staffed with an emergency physician in addition to regular personnel.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nGraz is twinned with:\n\nOther forms of cooperation and city friendship similar to the twin city programmes\n Ni\u0161, Serbia\n Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nThe following are past and present notable residents of Graz.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Austria portal\nList of World Heritage Sites in Austria\nKastner & \u00d6hler\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"Graz: Stadtplanung und Stadtentwicklung (Rechnungshofbericht, 2006) in German\" (PDF). 2006.

        "wiki": "Graz ( GRAHTS, German: [\u0261\u0281a\u02d0ts] (listen); Slovene: Gradec) is the capital city of Styria and Austria's second-largest city after Vienna. As of 1 January 2019, Graz had a population of 328,276 (292,269 of whom had principal-residence status). In 2015, the population of the Graz larger urban zone (LUZ) stood at 633,168, based on principal-residence status. Graz has a long tradition as a seat of higher education. It has four colleges and four universities with more than 60,000 students. Its historic centre  (Altstadt) is one of the best-preserved city centres in Central Europe.For centuries, Graz was more important to Slovenes and Croats, both politically and culturally, than the capitals of Ljubljana, Slovenia and Zagreb, Croatia; it remains influential to this day. In 1999, the city's historic centre was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites and in 2010 the designation was expanded to include Eggenberg Palace (German: Schloss Eggenberg) on the western edge of the city. Graz was designated the Cultural Capital of Europe in 2003 and became a City of Culinary Delights in 2008.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name of the city, Graz, formerly spelled Gratz, most likely stems from the Slavic gradec, which means \"small castle\". Some archaeological finds point to the erection of a small castle by Alpine Slavic people, which over time became a heavily defended fortification. In literary Slovene and Croatian, gradec still means \"small castle\", forming a hypocoristic derivative of Proto-West-South Slavic *grad\u044cc\u044a, whichs descends via liquid metathesis from Common Slavic *gard\u044cc\u044a and via the Slavic third palatalisation from Proto-Slavic *gardiku, originally denoting \"small town, settlement\". The name thus follows the common South Slavic pattern for naming settlements as grad. The German name 'Graz' first appears in records in 1128.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGraz is situated on both sides of the Mur river in southeast Austria. It is about 200 km (120 mi) southwest of Vienna (Wien). The nearest larger urban centre is Maribor (Marburg) in Slovenia, which is about 50 km (31 mi) to the south. Graz is the state capital and largest city in Styria, a green and heavily forested region on the eastern edge of the Alps.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring municipalities ===\nThese towns and villages border Graz:\n\nto the north: Gratkorn, Stattegg, Weinitzen\nto the east: Kainbach bei Graz, Hart bei Graz, Raaba\nto the south: G\u00f6ssendorf, Feldkirchen bei Graz, Seiersberg\nto the west: Attendorf, Thal, Judendorf-Stra\u00dfengel\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nGraz is divided into 17 municipal districts (Stadtbezirke):\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement on the ground of the modern city of Graz dates back to the Copper Age. However, no historical continuity exists of a settlement before the Middle Ages.\nDuring the 12th century, dukes under Babenberg rule made the town into an important commercial center. Later, Graz came under the rule of the Habsburgs and, in 1281, gained special privileges from King Rudolph I.\nIn the 14th century, Graz became the city of residence of the Inner Austrian line of the Habsburgs. The royalty lived in the Schlossberg castle and from there ruled Styria, Carinthia, most of today's Slovenia, and parts of Italy (Carniola, Gorizia and Gradisca, Trieste).\nIn the 16th century, the city's design and planning were primarily controlled by Italian Renaissance architects and artists. One of the most famous buildings representative of this style is the Landhaus, designed by Domenico dell'Allio, and used by the local rulers as a governmental headquarters.\n\nThe University of Graz was founded by Archduke Karl II in 1585, it's the city's oldest university. For most of its existence, it was controlled by the Catholic church, and was closed in 1782 by Joseph II in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a lyceum where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-established as a university by Emperor Franz I, and was named 'Karl-Franzens Universit\u00e4t' or 'Charles-Francis University' in English. More than 30,000 students are currently enrolled at this university.\nThe astronomer Johannes Kepler lived in Graz for a short period. He worked as a math teacher and was a professor of mathematics at the University of Graz, but still found time to study astronomy. He left Graz for Prague when Lutherans were banned from the city.\nLudwig Boltzmann was Professor for Mathematical Physics from 1869 to 1890. During that time, Nikola Tesla studied electrical engineering at the Polytechnic in 1875. Nobel Laureate Otto Loewi taught at the University of Graz from 1909 until 1938. Ivo Andric, the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature Laureate obtained his doctorate at the University of Graz. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger was briefly chancellor of the University of Graz in 1936.\nGraz is centrally located within today's Bundesland (state) of Styria, or Steiermark in German. Mark is an old German word indicating a large area of land used as a defensive border, in which the peasantry is taught how to organize and fight in the case of an invasion. With a strategic location at the head of the open and fertile Mur valley, Graz was historically a target of invaders, such as the Hungarians under Matthias Corvinus in 1481, and the Ottoman Turks in 1529 and 1532. Apart from the Riegersburg Castle, the Schlossberg was the only fortification in the region that never fell to the Ottoman Turks. Graz is home to the region's provincial armory, which is the world's largest historical collection of late medieval and Renaissance weaponry. It has been preserved since 1551, and displays over 30,000 items.\nFrom the earlier part of the 15th century, Graz was the residence of the younger branch of the Habsburgs, which succeeded to the imperial throne in 1619 in the person of Emperor Ferdinand II, who moved the capital to Vienna. New fortifications were built on the Schlossberg at the end of the 16th century. Napoleon's army occupied Graz in 1797. In 1809, the city withstood another assault by the French army. During this attack, the commanding officer in the fortress was ordered to defend it with about 900 men against Napoleon's army of about 3,000. He successfully defended the Schlossberg against eight attacks, but they were forced to give up after the Grande Arm\u00e9e occupied Vienna and the Emperor ordered to surrender. Following the defeat of Austria by Napoleonic forces at the Battle of Wagram in 1809, the fortifications were demolished using explosives, as stipulated in the Peace of Sch\u00f6nbrunn of the same year. The belltower (Glockenturm) and the civic clock tower (Uhrturm), which is a leading tourist attraction and serves as a symbol for Graz, were spared after the citizens of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation.Archduke Karl II of Inner Austria had 20,000 Protestant books burned in the square of what is now a mental hospital, and succeeded in returning Styria to the authority of the Holy See. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was born in Graz in what is now the Stadtmuseum (city museum).\n\n\n== Population development ==\nThe more recent population figures do not give the whole picture as only people with principal-residence status are counted and people with secondary residence status are not. Most of the people with secondary residence status in Graz are students. At the end of 2016 there were 33,473 people with secondary residence status in Graz.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nOceanic climate is the type found in the city, but due to the 0 \u00b0C isotherm, the same occurs in a humid continental climate with based in K\u00f6ppen system (Cfb/Dfb borderline). Wladimir K\u00f6ppen himself was in town and conducted studies to see how the climate of the past influenced the Continental Drift theory. Due to its position southeast of the Alps, Graz is shielded from the prevailing westerly winds that bring weather fronts in from the North Atlantic to northwestern and central Europe. The weather in Graz is thus influenced by the Mediterranean, and it has more hours of sunshine per year than Vienna or Salzburg and also less wind or rain. Graz lies in a basin that is only open to the south, causing the climate to be warmer than would be expected at that latitude. Plants are found in Graz that normally grow much further south.\n\naverage temperatures: Graz Airport 8.7 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) / Karl-Franzens University 9.4 \u00b0C (49 \u00b0F)\naverage rainfall: 818 mm (32 in) with on average 92 days of rain (Karl Franzens University)\naverage hours of sunshine: 1,989 (Karl Franzens University)\n\n\n== Slovenes and Graz ==\nPolitically, culturally, scientifically and religiously, Graz was an important centre for all Slovenes, especially from the establishment of the University of Graz in 1586 until the establishment of University of Ljubljana in 1919. In 1574, the first Slovene Catholic book was published in Graz, and in 1592, Hieronymus Megiser published in Graz the book Dictionarium quatuor linguarum, the first multilingual dictionary of Slovene.The Styrian Slovenes did not consider Graz a German-speaking city, but their own, a place to study while living at their relatives' homes and to fulfill one's career ambitions. The student associations in Graz were a crucible of the Slovene identity, and the Slovene students in Graz were more nationally aware than some others. This led to fierce anti-Slovene efforts of German-speaking nationalists in Graz before and during World War II.Many Slovenian Styrians study there. Slovenes are among the professors at the Institute for Jazz in Graz. Numerous Slovenes have found employment there, while being formerly unemployed in Slovenia. For the Slovene culture, Graz remains permanently important due to its university and the Universalmuseum Joanneum archives containing numerous documents from the Slovenian Styria.A symposium on the relation of Graz and the Slovenes was held in Graz in 2010, at the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the first and oldest chair of Slovene. It was established at the Lyzeum of Graz in July 1811 on the initiative of Janez Nepomuk Primic. A collection of lectures on the topic was published. The Slovenian Post commemorated the anniversary with a stamp.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nFor the year that Graz was Cultural Capital of Europe, new structures were erected. The Graz Museum of Contemporary Art (German: Kunsthaus) was designed by Peter Cook and Colin Fournier and is situated next to the Mur river. The Island in the Mur is a floating platform made of steel. It was designed by American architect Vito Acconci and contains a caf\u00e9, an open-air theatre and a playground.\n\n\n=== Historic city centre ===\n\nThe historic centre was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999 due to the harmonious co-existence of typical buildings from different epochs and in different architectural styles. Situated in a cultural borderland between Central Europe, Italy and the Balkan States, Graz absorbed various influences from the neighbouring regions and thus received its exceptional townscape. Today the historic centre consists of over 1,000 buildings, their age ranging from Gothic to contemporary.\nThe most important sights in the historic centre are:\n\nTown Hall (Rathaus).\nThe Castle hill (German: Schlossberg), a hill dominating the historic centre (475 m (1,558.40 ft) high), site of a demolished fortress, with views over Graz.\nThe Clock Tower (Uhrturm) is a symbol of Graz, at the top of the Castle hill.\nThe New Gallery (Neue Galerie), a museum of art.\nThe Castle hill funicular (Schlossbergbahn), a funicular railway on the Castle hill's slope.\nThe seat of Styria's provincial parliament (Landhaus), a palace in Lombardic style. It is one of the most important examples of Renaissance architecture in Austria and was built by Italian architect Domenico dell'Allio between 1557 and 1565.\nThe Armoury (Landeszeughaus) is the largest of its kind in the world.\nThe Graz Opera House (Opernhaus), the principal venue for opera, ballet, and operetta performances. It is the 2nd largest opera house in Austria.\nThe Graz Theatre (Schauspielhaus), Graz's principal theatre for productions of plays.\nThe Cathedral (Dom), a rare monument of Gothic architecture. Once, there were many frescos on the outer walls; today, only a few remain, like the Landplagenbild (\"picture of plagues\") painted in 1485, presumably by Thomas von Villach. The three plagues it depicts are locusts, pestilence and the invasion of the Turks, all of them striking the town in 1480. It features the oldest painted view of Graz.\nThe mausoleum of Emperor Ferdinand II next to the cathedral, the most important building of Mannerism in Graz.

Several buildings around the universities are of this style, for example the green houses by Volker Giencke and the RESOWI center by G\u00fcnther Domenig.\nBefore Graz became the European Capital of Culture in 2003, several new projects were realized, such as the Stadthalle, the Kindermuseum (museum for children), the Helmut-List-Halle, the Kunsthaus and the Murinsel.\n\nTallest buildings\nBuildings in Graz which are at least 50m tall: \n\n\n=== Sports ===\nSK Sturm Graz is the main football club of the city, with three Austrian championships and five runner-up seasons.

The Grazer ORF, the Graz subsidiary of Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, launched an initiative in 2008 called Scho wieda Steirisch g'redt in order to highlight the numerous dialects of Graz and Styria in general and to cultivate the pride many Styrians hold for their local culture. Two reasons for a melding of these dialects with Standard German: the influence of television and radio bringing Standard German into the home and the industrialization causing the disappearance of the single farmer since the farming communities are seen as the true keepers of dialect speaking.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nAn extensive public transport network makes Graz an easy city to navigate without a car. The city has a comprehensive bus network, complementing the Graz tram network consisting of eight lines. Four lines pass through the underground tram stop at the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof) and on to the city centre before branching out. Furthermore, there are seven night-time bus routes, although these run only at weekends and on evenings preceding public holidays.\nThe Schlossbergbahn, a funicular railway, and the Schlossberg lift, a vertical lift, link the city centre to the Schlossberg.\nFrom the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), regional trains link to most of Styria. Direct trains run to most major cities nearby including Vienna, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Maribor and Ljubljana in Slovenia, Zagreb in Croatia, Budapest in Hungary, Prague and Brno in the Czech Republic, Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland, as well as Munich, Stuttgart, Heidelberg, and Frankfurt in Germany. Trains for Vienna leave every hour. In recent years many railway stations within the city limits and in the suburbs have been rebuilt or modernised and are now part of the \"S-Bahn Graz\", a commuter train service connecting the city with its suburban area and towns nearby.\nGraz airport is located about 10 km (6 mi) south of the city centre and is accessible by bus, railway, and car. Direct destinations include Amsterdam, Berlin, D\u00fcsseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart, Istanbul, Vienna and Zurich.\n\n\n== Health ==\nIn Graz there are seven hospitals, several private hospitals and sanatoriums, as well as 44 pharmacies.\nThe University Hospital Graz (LKH-Universit\u00e4ts-Klinikum Graz) is located in eastern Graz and has 1,556 beds and 7,190 employees.

Perpetually two emergency doctor's cars (NEF \u2013 Notarzteinsatzfahrzeug), two NAWs (Notarztwagen \u2013 ambulances staffed with a physician in addition to regular personnel) and about 30 RTWs (Rettungswagen \u2013 regular ambulances) are on standby. Furthermore, several non-emergency ambulances (KTW \u2013 Krankentransportwagen) and a Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) are operated by the Red Cross to transport non-emergency patients to and between hospitals. In addition to the Red Cross, the Labourers'-Samaritan-Alliance (Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund \u00d6sterreichs), the Austrian organisation of the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps (Malteser Hospitaldienst Austria) and the Green Cross (Gr\u00fcnes Kreuz) operate ambulances (KTW) for non-emergency patient transport. In addition to the cars, there's also the C12 air ambulance helicopter stationed at Graz airport, staffed with an emergency physician in addition to regular personnel.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nGraz is twinned with:\n\nOther forms of cooperation and city friendship similar to the twin city programmes\n Ni\u0161, Serbia\n Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nThe following are past and present notable residents of Graz.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Austria portal\nList of World Heritage Sites in Austria\nKastner & \u00d6hler\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"Graz: Stadtplanung und Stadtentwicklung (Rechnungshofbericht, 2006) in German\" (PDF). 2006.

          "We spent pretty much the whole day here although you do not have to as the tours are only an hour long and you can leave when you like. We did not take a tour as unfortunately they were in German only that day. This did not hinder our visit as we wandered around at our leisure",
          "We payed over 20 euros (10,5\u20ac/student) for the guided tour because we were genuinely interested in the history about the horses. Well, no one at the office told us that the tour is held in german by a man Who spoke 0 english... We even asked if we could get some information in",
          "Well - as keen riders, we would have liked to see more of the stallions and the mares with their foals a little closer. However, we understand that they need their peace too! We had a one-hour tour of the stud, saw the old stallions, mostly retired with one aged 40! Then mares",
          "After our visit of Vienna we decided to go to the Bundesgest\u00fct of the Spanische Hofreitschule. Being a horselover it is certainly a must when you are in the neighborhood of Graz. We stayed the whole day and could not get enough of being with these wonderful horses. However, I",

          "My two teen daughters love horses, and our short trip itinerary included Vienna (Spanish Riding School) and continued to Piber. We stayed in a guest house 300m from the Stud Farm for two nights. Upon arriving late afternoon we just walked in, patted Lipizzaners out in a paddock",
          "We went on a Saturday and there is no demonstration. We knew that and it was still a very interesting and enjoyable day out. The guided tour was informative and all the questions were answered. It is worth to take the tour. One of the highlights was seeing the foals jumping",
          "The Piber Stud Farm is dedicated to the breeding of the famous Lipizzaner Stallions, which perform at the Spanish Riding School in Vienna. 60,000 people visit here annually, where they meet the breeding mares, see the foals, and learn about the breeding process and how these",
          "We visited and took the guided tour of these studs of this horse riding school In Graz that is home of the oldest thoroughbred horse breed in Europe. We enjoyed the museum, and stud stables and learning about the history of the breed and petting the foals. Lipizzaner",
          "The training consisted of 2 horses riding around in circles & the tour was boring. The training was shorter than it was advertised and part of the tour consisted of a movie showing how the horses get new horse shoes. We did get to see the foles which was nice but that was",
          "Had a lovely day out here, wonderful to see the Lipizzaner foals with their mothers and older horses in their training. There is also a lot of history to learn too. It is very clean, staff are friendly (and speak English) and there are plenty of facilites such as a cafe. I",
          "As very horsey people and having seen the Spanish Riding School performance, behind the scenes tour and exercise to music in Vienna we felt we must finish our few days by hiring a car to go out to the Stud Farm at Piber. I know you shouldn't compare but having visited many stud",
          "We went on a trip from Graz to see the stables where horses are bred and prepared for the Vienna Spanish Riding School. The tour of the facilities was interesting and detailed. Above all, the many horses - stallions, mares and foals - were beautiful to watch. It was an enjoyable",
          "A visit here will make you aware of the famous Spanish Riding School horses. The tour is extremely informative, as it provides an insight to the breeding, training, lives and retirement of the horses. The tour is all inclusive and guided by extremely knowledgeable people. Also",
          "After visiting the Spanish Riding School in Vienna to watch the morning exercise and guided tour, I was excited by the brochure advertising the stud in Piber. We had a spare day so we hired a car and drove south to Korflach. The country side was gorgeous and the trip was a nice",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed this tour of the spanish riding school stud farm. We ended having a virtually private tour just myself my partner and my in-laws. The gentleman giving the guided tour was informative and friendly and we got to see the foals and their mothers having their",

          "After the boss nearly fainted with pleasure at the Spanish Riding School in Vienna 2 years ago, I arranged a visit to Piber near Graz for her birthday - which happened to co-incide with the Herbstparade. We took the train from Vienna and stayed in Koflach for a few days. The",
          "Horses were really beautiful and the place itself was too, however, I find the price too much for what we got to see. there was one cinema, ring where you could watch lessons if you made it in time (we didn't), three barns with six horses each and a barn with foals and foal",
          "We drove from Graz to the farm to see the Lipizzaner horses. This was a nice spring activity, as there were several goals to see, as well as year-long fillies to pet. The Stallions were beautiful and friendly. This was a nice way to see these beautiful animals, but non-horse",
          "You may think that a couple of white horses dancing to classical music is a tourist attraction, but visiting the stud farm is really an experience you should not miss when in the area. At the farm, you will mainly see female horses, male horses in retirement, young horses still",
          "We were there on a lovely and sunny day and could see the horses used in the Spanish Riding School. We had a guided tour in English and could see the stables, trainingring, visit the cute foals and the carrige museum. A nice shop with different things for people interested in",
          "Despite other reviewer comments, we found it quite easy to travel from Graz to Koflach and thence to Piber. The local train from Graz stops frequently, but stops are quick, and the train is quite comfortable (no first class, but lots of leg room anyway). It would be a long",
          "Wanted to take the grandchildren to see the horses in their various stages of maturity like my husband and I had seen in Slovenia. This place is not a patch on the one in Slovenia where you can see horses galore. Even the exercise to music wasn't what I'd hoped it would be, only",

          "Enjoyed our side trip to the see the magnificent horses. Only a few horses in the barn, the rest were out on the hillside fields that you could not see. Only did the audio tour. Beautiful church on the grounds.",
          "Lovely spot in Styria where the Lipizzaners are bred and raised for their first few years. The guided tours were not available in English for our visit, but the audio guides were an adequate substitute. We actually enjoyed the chance to peruse the designated stable tour area at",
          "This was a great experience for horse lovers. If horses aren't your thing, you probably wouldn't enjoy it as much. We visited in the middle of winter on a weekday, and we did not see any foals or yearlings. We saw and got to pet the group of pregnant mares, two barns of",
          "You don't get a lot in the winter. Not much is happening and the tour is not so long. To see the horses you must take a tour which is in German. Our guide seemed so passionate, so enthusiastic but we could not understand a word. The audio guide is helpful, but after a while",
          "If you are at all horsey then this is an absolute MUST. The sight of the Lippizaner Stallions in the home yard and the Mares with foals in the stables is sheer magic",
          "This attraction is more suitable for people who speak German. The introductory film did not have sub-titles in any language and I know we missed a lot of information about the farm. We did have an English speaking guide who gave us a very short tour of the barns where we saw",
          "This farm is beautiful! Our guide did speak very good English, but it was arranged by our tour company. Not sure if you can get an English speaker if you go on your own. Loved seeing the mares and foals. They are so cute! We saw a small portion of the morning training inside a",
          "From the perspective of two mature English speaking travellers this visit was a major disappointment. Having seen a performance of the Spanish Riding School in Vienna and purchased a program, this visit did not provide us with anything further. The two films shown are in German,",
          "Just beautiful - and we end up also with a contest that was amazing!!! The Lipizzaner Horses are beautiful - they are born grey and they grow into beautiful white stallions. A must see if you go in the area.",
          "We went here with high hopes. As a child I learnt to ride in Vienna under the instruction of someone from the riding school so always felt a connection. Firstly on entering the cost was very expensive especially relative to other attractions in Styria and what was on offer.",
          "The Spanish Riding School in Wienna gets their white horses (Lipizaner) from Piber. And this is also where the old horses go for retirement. It is an impressive and beautiful experience to go there. We've been there two times now. And we will sure be back soon. The foals - not",
          "(We were here the beginning of July, perfect timing to see the foals.) The Stud Farm is located in a beautiful area of Styria with rolling green hills and valleys and picturesque villages. We really enjoyed our horsey experience at Piber\u2014seeing and hearing the vocal stallions as",
          "We loved our couple of days in Piber where you could get up close and personal with the horses. BUT can anyone tell me the name of the hotel right next to the stables? I want to recommend it to friends but have lost the name? Please help if you can",
          "Great for horse lovers or anyone interested in the Spanish riding school. I would recommend going in Summer when all the foals are born, we actually didn't get to see any foals and it was really cold.",
          "I have loved Lipizzaner horses since I was a child, and had always wanted to visit the Spanish Riding School in Vienna. When we decided to visit Graz during our trip to Austria, I was determined to go to Piber - although I thought I would miss out as I got very sick with the",
          "I guess i'm getting jaded in my old age but to me , a horse is a horse is a horse and the Lippinzanners are another horse . Kids loved it . You can get up real close and touch horses . We were a bit miffed there were no horses in fields at all like my wife said she had seen in",
          "We had toured the stables in Vienna the previous day so we had a 50% off coupon (you need one per person). As others have said, the tours are in German. However, you can wander around on your own if you don't speak German. We had a great time there (bring a lunch as the",
          "If you are wanting to get a full experience of these amazing horses, then show up in the morning. We did not arrive until 1500 and all the horses were already in the stables. Still had to pay 12 euro per adult though. You don't have to be on an organized tour, and they are",
          "I planned my trip to Austria with a must see of the Lipizzaners. I made a side trip to Piber to see the birthplace of this tremendous breed. There was a very unfriendly supervisor at the stud farm's desk. She had a person at the farm that very minute who was American by",
          "If you like horses at all, you will love the stud farm at Piber. (If you have seen the Lipizzaner stallions perform at the Vienna Riding Academy, you will find it awesome!) This is a very interactive location, where you can see horses being trained, shod, exercised,and",
          "The Piber Stud farm is an experience not to be missed, if one has any affection for horses. We visited it in the Spring of 2003 - the entire area around it is lovely - verdant, green, forested. Our group was mostly Germans/Austrians, and the tourguide ensured that we {my"

        "wiki": "The Lurgrotte karst cave is the largest cave in the Eastern Alps of Styria, Austria. It is located about 16 km (9.9 mi) north of Graz and crosses the Tannenben karst region. The cave has two accessible entrances, one at the village of Semriach and the other at the village of Peggau. At the Semriach entrance, the Lur River sinks into the cave. At the Peggau entrance, the Schmelz River emerges from within the cave, flowing to the west and eventually joining the Mur River.\n\n\n== History ==\nArchaeologists have found material in and around the cave that indicates habitation since the Paleolithic era. One specimen, a reindeer bone with tool markings, has been radiocarbon dated to approximately 52,000 years ago.The cave was first scientifically explored by the Italian cave explorer Max Brunello on April 1, 1894. While the higher portions of the cave were known to locals, Brunello was the first to discover the lower portion of the cave. The next attempt to explore further provoked disaster.\nOn April 29, 1894, seven cavers entered the Lurgrotte, despite heavy rainfall. A flash flood occurred while they were inside, and they wound up trapped for ten days. Emperor Franz Joseph I approved a rescue effort, employing large numbers of workers, miners, and divers who bailed out the water and successfully rescued the trapped cavers.In February 1905, members of the Austrian Tourist Club surveyed 1,002 m (3,287 ft) of passages within the Lurgrotte.In the 1920s, the cave explorer Hermann Mayer worked with his father to develop the Peggauer section of the Lurgrotte for visitors. In addition, they tried to find a link between the Peggauer entry and Semriach entry. On November 26, 1924, the route was cleared by explosives, but it was not until 1935 that the first crossing was possible.On May 23, 1926, the pioneering female cave explorer Leopoldine Fuhrich fell approximately 20 m (66 ft) to her death while exploring Lurgrotte. There is a memorial plaque for her still inside the cave.On February 24, 1927, the city of Frohnleiten hosted an auction for the grotto, including a restaurant, two mansions, and 35,359 m2 (380,600 sq ft) of ground, in the interests of preserving the Lurgrotte as a domestic enterprise.  On July 8, 1927, the District Court of Frohnleiten held another auction of the Lurgrotte, which was eventually won by a wine-trader named Pezzi. Pezzi planned to turn the Lurgrotte into a show cave and construct railway through the cave.The first complete crossing of about 5 km (3.1 mi) long cave succeeded in 1935. In the following years the Lurgrotte was developed into a show cave, with infrastructure such as bridges, walkways, and lights added for visitors. From 1962 it was possible for visitors to wander through the entire cave, until 1975, when parts of the infrastructure were washed away in a powerful storm. Because the flooding recurs on a yearly basis, the full infrastructure has never been repaired.\n\n\n== Hydrology ==\n\nThe Lurgrotte is a complex, three-level cave which forms a drainage system for the entire Tanneben karst area. Because of its complexity, and the difficulty in exploring the cave's numerous underground channels, the cave's hydrology is poorly understood. It is known that the Lur River enters at the Semriach entry, and the Schmelz River exits from the Peggau side. When rainfall is heavy, excess water from the Lur system can overflow into the Schmelz system, so it is confirmed that there is a high-water connection between the two, although its location and extent are still unknown.Attempts to trace the outflow using dye have shown that the water from the Lur emerges in springs south of the cave, while the flow of the Schmelz appears to originate from sources north of the Lurgrotte.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nSince the flooding of 1975, it is no longer possible to cross through the caves from one side to another. Visitors can instead tour through a shortened area at each end of the cave. From Peggau, regular guided tours enter 1 km (0.62 mi) into the cave, although in the winter longer tours of up to 4 km (2.5 mi) are available by appointment.From Semriach, tourists have access to approximately 2 km (1.2 mi) of the cave, including its largest gallery, called the Big Dome or the Bear Grotto due to the cave bear bones that have been found within. At 120 m (390 ft) long, 80 m (260 ft) wide, and a 40 m (130 ft) tall, it is one of Central Europe's largest underground rooms.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBenischke, Ralf: Lurgrotte's commemorative publication 1894-1994 - on the occasion of the centenary of the cessation of cave explorers by floods and their salvation.

          "This is a good stop if you enjoy churches. The church is gothic in style and architecture. Once you get inside you will be met with a modern decor that lovers of European minimalist design will enjoy. It is a working church so try to visit at an hour when mass is not occurring."

          "Interesting detail is the Turk figure, which looks very small and far from the house almost inconspicuous. It is reminiscent of the siege of the city by the Ottomans in 1532. Related to it is also a legend, according \u2026",

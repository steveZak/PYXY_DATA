        "wiki": "The Paseo Los Pr\u00f3ceres (translatable into English as The Heroes' Walk) is a monument located in the Venezuelan city of Caracas, near Fort Tiuna and the Military Academy of the Bolivarian Army. On the promenade there are statues of the heroes of the War of Independence, as well as fountains, stairs, squares, roads and walls. Since 1993, the Paseo Los Pr\u00f3ceres and the entire annex system was declared a National Historic Landmark.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was inaugurated in 1956 by President Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez, calling it El Sistema de Nacionalidad (The System of Nationality) in honor of the independence struggles of Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela. It was created to represent the Venezuelan military institution on an urban scale, it is part of the System of Nationality which is made up of several elements linked by a large road and pedestrian axis that articulates the ceremonial complex structured by the great Courtyard of Honor as a highlight and receiver of the urban axis that begins in the University City of Caracas.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe monument is defined by two rows of lighting poles as virtual walls. Located on the perimeter of Fort Tiuna, the largest national military complex, it articulates with the Military Academy of Venezuela, the parade courtyard, the monoliths of heroes, an oval of fountains, gardens and baroque ornaments. Glasses, cups and other pieces that commemorate the Greek Hellenistic period as the statue of the god of the waters, Poseidon, complement the architectural complex. Deployed along a two-kilometer avenue, it has driveways and grandstands on the sides, while fountains, gardens, four monoliths and huge statues in honor of the independence heroes extend in the center. It's the stage of great military parades and other official acts.\nThe Monument to the Heroes is formed by four parallelepipeds: two vertical ones made of travertine marble and two horizontal ones in black marble, each with 30 meters/98 ft in length and a total weight of 300 tons/672.000 lb. On the horizontal walls there are bronze statues representing the heroes of independence: Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre, Rafael Urdaneta, Santiago Mari\u00f1o, Francisco de Miranda, Jos\u00e9 Antonio P\u00e1ez, Manuel Piar, Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Ribas, Luis Bri\u00f3n, Juan Bautista Arismendi and Jos\u00e9 Francisco Berm\u00fadez. In the monoliths the names of the Venezuelan heroes and the four battles that sealed the independence of the Bolivarian countries were carved: Ayacucho, Boyac\u00e1, Carabobo and Pichincha, also represented in high relief. The Paseo de los Pr\u00f3ceres, part of these emblematic blocks, is a wide avenue whose side stands are stands for military parades and official events.The monument is part of the System of the Nationality whose original function was to connect the Central University of Venezuela with the Military School. It was designed in Neoclassical style by Malaussena Avenue Los Pr\u00f3ceres, presided over by the monument dedicated to national heroes, intended to occupy, in the urban geography of Caracas, the place of the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es occupy in Paris.The Paseo Los ilustres (The illustrious' walk) is a large vehicular avenue with driveways and a pedestrian island in the middle, erected as a tribute to the illustrious children of the nation, is the point of exchange of civil and military population, moving the Circle of Forces to the side Armed, headquarters for social events of members of the military institution. On the other hand, the Paseo de los S\u00edmbolos (Walk of the Symbols) is defined by a sculptural set made in bronze, on a marble pedestal and a water mirror. Performed by Ernesto Maragall in 1957, it constitutes an allegory to the Venezuelan national symbols: the coat of arms, the flag and the national anthem. On the Paseo Los Precursores (The precursors' walk) there's a sculpture of an Indian who stands on his horse, made of bronze, in the middle of a platform and marble base guarded by two lions, also by Maragall. A commemorative obelisk, mosaic paths, as well as the symmetrical design of the complex, offer the place a face of serenity, while bas-reliefs made in 1957 by sculptor Hugo Daini can be seen on one of the walls of the column.Scattered among the succession of fountains, squares and paths that go from the Monument of the Precursors to that of the Pr\u00f3ceres are other sculptural pieces in the form of nymph figures, executed in artificial stone. On the walk you can see the murals that tell the history of Venezuela from the colonization.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "wiki": "The National Pantheon of Venezuela (Pante\u00f3n Nacional de Venezuela) is a final resting place for national heroes. \nThe Pantheon (Latin Pantheon, from Greek Pantheon, meaning \"Temple of all the Gods\") was created in the 1870s on the site of a ruined church on the northern edge of the old town of Caracas, Venezuela.\nThe entire central nave is dedicated to Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, with the altar's place taken by the hero's bronze sarcophagus, while lesser luminaries are relegated to the aisles. The national pantheon's vault is covered with 1930s paintings depicting scenes from Bol\u00edvar's life, and the huge crystal chandelier glittering overhead was installed in 1883 on the centennial of his birth. The Pantheon was reopened in 2013 after a 3 year long process of expansion and restoration.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== List of people who are buried at the Pantheon ==\nCecilio Acosta.

          "Excellent location, but the place is really boring. I have been to all the museums of Caracas and this is not really worth your visit. The Afroamerican Museum in San Bernardino (private) is way better than this. The art galleries are boring. People are nice and well-mannered.",

      "name": "El \u00c1vila National Park",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The \u00c1vila National Park, officially known as Waraira Repano National Park for its name indigenous Cariban name, protects part of the Cordillera de la Costa Central mountain range, in the coastal region of central-northern Venezuela. The area's highest elevation is Pico Naiguat\u00e1, at 2,765 meters (9,072 ft) above sea level.\n\n\n== Culture & traditions ==\nEl \u00c1vila is known as \"el pulm\u00f3n de la ciudad\", the lungs of the city, since it serves many different functions for residents of Caracas, the most basic of these being navigation: the peak of El \u00c1vila marks the north of the city. It is home to the longest cable car ride in the world, as well as activities like running, biking, rock climbing, camping, and zip-lining. El Hotel Humboldt as well as many restaurants, including La Chivera, Casa Pakea, El Jard\u00edn de Luna, Le Galipanier, Granja Natalia and Tarahumara, are all nestled in the mountain's hills. Every December, the \"Cruz de Navidad\" is illuminated, a large crucifix high up in the mountain that faces the city and can be seen from very far distances.\n\n\n=== Legend of Pacheco ===\nA common expression amongst Caracas city-dwellers to describe the change in seasons is \"Pacheco has arrived,\" which is a reference to the legend of Pacheco the flower-picker. He was known to be a resident of el Galip\u00e1n, a region in el \u00c1vila close to the coast that tended to mark the border between the coast's chilly weather and that of the hot, dry weather of the rest of the country. El Galip\u00e1n was home to some of the most beautiful, unique flowers in the country, and every December Pacheco would make the long trip down the mountain into the city to sell his harvest in the Plaza Bolivar in Caracas. His arrival was often accompanied by the cold December weather, and over time, the expression \"Pacheco has arrived\" came to mean that the weather is about to get colder.\n\n\n== History ==\nEl \u00c1vila was declared a park in 1958, fulfilling an interest in its protection that had been prevalent since the 19th century. With its creation came the protection of the forested mountains that surround Caracas, the capital of Venezuela. These mountains now serve as both a recreational area and as a buffer to pollution and urban expansion. El \u00c1vila has always been an important resource for the inhabitants of Caracas, who have used the area for a variety of activities, some of which have threatened its conservation. A hotel and a cable car, which climbs to the highest point at 2,135 meters (7,005 ft) above sea level and drops down the other side to the city of Macuto, were opened in 1956. After being out of service for 20 years, this cable car was reopened in February 2002.\n\n\n== Biodiversity ==\nThis park has a high diversity of fauna and flora. More than 100 butterfly species, approximately 120 mammal species, 20 amphibians, 30 reptiles and 500 bird species (36% of Venezuela avifauna) have been documented. Nine bird species are endemic to Venezuela and three threatened bird species live in this park; one of the most coloured bird specimen in this park is the *querrequerre* (Cyanocorax yncas). In addition, more than 1,800 plant species from diverse taxonomic groups can be observed. Several of these plants are endemic to the Cordillera de la Costa mountain range with some endemic to the park itself.\n\n\n== Vegetation ==\nThe vegetation is of mountain forest, with variations that is distributed according to the height. Between sea level and 200 or 300 meters (and even higher up in the orientation of relief) is the xeric forest, where prevail species like cuj\u00ed (Prosopis juliflora). Between 800\u20131500 m ombr\u00f3filo sub-evergreen forest is characterized by 2-3 arboreal strata and relatively dense undergrowth is located. Among the 1,200 - 3 tree storeys and undergrowth well developed - 2,200 masl ombr\u00f3filo evergreen forest with 2 stands. In these forests abundant species of the families of orchids, ferns, bromeliads, aroids, and have reported endemic species of the family Sapindaceae, Melastomataceae, Rubiaceae and Myrtaceae and arborescent ferns and palms (Ceroxylon ceriferum). These forests boast the only extant natural population of the critically endangered Venezuelan walnut tree (Juglans venezuelensis). Presents anthropogenic savannas where predominate species like melao capim (Melinis minutiflora), the bambusillo (Arthrostylidium venezuelae), yellow tara (Oyedaea verbesinoides) and incense (Espeletia neriifolia). In the upper regions of the Silla of Caracas and the Pico Naiguat\u00e1 is a characteristic vegetation of coastal bush subp\u00e1ramo, consisting of open shrub of 1\u20133 m tall with a herbaceous relatively well developed, being the most characteristic species incense or frailej\u00f3n tree (Libanothamnus nerufolius), Spanish flag (Castilleja fissifolia) and false frailej\u00f3n (Liabum megacephalum).\n\n\n== Threats ==\nEl \u00c1vila can be classified as vulnerable because there is a risk that the diverse threats it faces will increasingly erode its biodiversity unless in the near future constant monitoring occurs. The most immediate threats to the park, forest fires and illegal settlements, are located primarily near Caracas. However, the concentration of resources and vigilance in those areas closest to the city has resulted in more problems in the more isolated northern slope and eastern sector of El \u00c1vila. These areas suffer from a lack of signs, infrastructure and vigilance. Other threats include the presence of exotic plants, the Caracas Aerial Tramway, the Hotel Humboldt and poaching.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nEl \u00c1vila National Park is located along the central stretch of the Cordillera de la Costa, at 10\u00b0 32' latitude north and between 66\u00b0 12' and 67\u00b0 01' longitude west (see map). It covers the mountainous regions between the Caribbean Sea and the valleys of Caracas, Guatire, Guarenas and Barlovento. The park contains part of the following states: Vargas (northern slope), Capital District (southern and western slope) and Miranda (eastern slope).\n\nThe National Park is named for the Cerro El \u00c1vila (Mountain El \u00c1vila), usually just referred to as \"El \u00c1vila\", which reaches 2,740 meters (8,990 ft)  above sea level. This mountain rises north of the capital Caracas located in a narrow valley 950 meters (3,120 ft) above sea level and separates the city from the Caribbean Sea. The mountain is accessible by cable car (teleferico), by off-road vehicle, and on foot. In addition to the scenery, one may visit the hacienda, laboratory and mausoleum of Gottfried Knoche; a German-born doctor who was notorious for his experiments in mummification. They are accessible only by footpath.\nThe park follows a mountain range 80 kilometers (50 mi) long and approximately 16 km wide. It contains over 81,800 hectares (202,000 acres), encompassing a wide variety of ecosystems that vary along the altitude gradient from 120 to 2,765 meters (394 to 9,072 ft) above sea level at Naiguat\u00e1 peak. In the lower areas of the northern side, the vegetation is mainly xerophytes, represented by a variety of cacti, shrubs and spiny species. From 300 to 600 meters (980 to 1,970 ft), semi-deciduous forests dominate, whereas from 600 to 800 meters (2,000 to 2,600 ft) the seasonal semi-deciduous forests are common. From 800 to 1,500 meters (2,600 to 4,900 ft) above sea level on the northern slope and from 1,200 to 1,600 meters (3,900 to 5,200 ft) on the southern slope, the forests are mainly sub-mountainous evergreen forests. Due to the constant condensation by the cooling of the air masses and the decrease of atmospheric pressure, cloud forest dominates between 1,500 and 2,200 meters (4,900 and 7,200 ft) above sea level. Finally, the lack of water at 2,200 meters (7,200 ft) and higher permits only sub-p\u00e1ramo vegetation. Beautiful forests grow along the numerous watercourses that flow on either side of the mountain.\nThe temperatures vary widely on El \u00c1vila, with an average temperature of 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) in the lower sections of Caracas valley and 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) on Naiguat\u00e1 peak, where the lowest temperature ever recorded was 2 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F). The annual average rainfall fluctuates between 600 and 1,400 millimeters (24 and 55 in) and is influenced by orography, which explains why rain is more abundant on the northern slope where the mountain faces the trade winds.\n\n\n== Trails ==\nThere are plenty of trails in El \u00c1vila National Park for outdoor enthusiasts. From low-level routes to high technical complexity, there is a trail for everyone.\nThe most famous trails are: Los Venados, Sabas Nieves, El Vivero, Los Pinos, Papel\u00f3n, Rancho Grande, Cachimbo, Miguel Delgado, Lomas del Cu\u00f1o, El Para\u00edso, La Julia, Picacho, Piedra del Indio, Lagunazo, Pico Oriental, Pico Occidental, Cabeza de Elefante and Pico Naiguat\u00e1.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nTelef\u00e9rico de Caracas\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nParkswatch.org: Information about El \u00c1vila National Park\nSoundsandcolours.com: \"El \u00c1vila National Park: The Protective Lungs of Caracas\"",

        "wiki": "Venezuela (; American Spanish: [bene\u02c8swela] (listen)), officially the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (Spanish: Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela), is a country on the northern coast of South America, consisting of a continental landmass and many small islands and islets in the Caribbean Sea. It has a territorial extension of 916,445 km2 (353,841 sq mi) and the population of Venezuela was estimated at 28 million in 2019. The capital and largest urban agglomeration is the city of Caracas.\nThe continental territory is bordered on the north by the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, on the west by Colombia, Brazil on the south, Trinidad and Tobago to the north-east and on the east by Guyana. The Venezuelan government maintains a claim against Guyana to Guayana Esequiba. Venezuela is a federal presidential republic consisting of 23 states, the Capital District and federal dependencies covering Venezuela's offshore islands. Venezuela is among the most urbanized countries in Latin America; the vast majority of Venezuelans live in the cities of the north and in the capital.\nThe territory of Venezuela was colonized by Spain in 1522 amid resistance from indigenous peoples. In 1811, it became one of the first Spanish-American territories to declare independence from the Spanish as a department of the federal republic of Gran Colombia. It gained full sovereignty as a country in 1830. During the 19th century, Venezuela suffered political turmoil and autocracy, remaining dominated by regional military dictators until the mid-20th century. Since 1958, the country has had a series of democratic governments. Economic shocks in the 1980s and 1990s led to major political crises and widespread social unrest, including the deadly Caracazo riots of 1989, two attempted coups in 1992, and the impeachment of President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez for embezzlement of public funds in 1993. \nA collapse in confidence in the existing parties saw the 1998 election of former coup-involved career officer Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and the launch of the Bolivarian Revolution. The revolution began with a 1999 Constituent Assembly, where a new Constitution of Venezuela was imposed. This new constitution officially changed the name of the country to Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Ch\u00e1vez established populist social welfare policies bolstered by soaring oil prices, increasing social spending, temporarily and reducing economic inequality and poverty in the early years of the regime. In 2013, Ch\u00e1vez died and was succeeded by Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who was elected by a narrow majority in a widely disputed election. Maduro continued the populist policies, but with disastrous economic results which triggered another nationwide crisis that continues to this day.Venezuela is a developing country and ranks 96th on the Human Development Index. It has the world's largest known oil reserves and has been one of the world's leading exporters of oil. Previously, the country was an underdeveloped exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and cocoa, but oil quickly came to dominate exports and government revenues. The excesses and poor policies of the incumbent government led to the collapse of Venezuela's entire economy. The country struggles with record hyperinflation, shortages of basic goods, unemployment, poverty, disease, high child mortality, malnutrition, severe crime and corruption. These factors have precipitated the Venezuelan migrant crisis where more than three million people have fled the country. By 2017, Venezuela was declared to be in default regarding debt payments by credit rating agencies. The crisis in Venezuela has contributed to a rapidly deteriorating human rights situation, including increased abuses such as torture, arbitrary imprisonment, extrajudicial killings and attacks on human rights advocates, while Maduro has become increasingly described as an autocratic and dictatorial leader by foreign observers.\nVenezuela is a charter member of the UN, OAS, UNASUR, ALBA, Mercosur, LAIA and OEI.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nAccording to the most popular and accepted version, in 1499, an expedition led by Alonso de Ojeda visited the Venezuelan coast. The stilt houses in the area of Lake Maracaibo reminded the Italian navigator, Amerigo Vespucci, of the city of Venice, Italy, so he named the region Veneziola, or \"Little Venice\". The Spanish version of Veneziola is Venezuela.Mart\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez de Enciso, a member of the Vespucci and Ojeda crew, gave a different account. In his work Summa de geograf\u00eda, he states that the crew found indigenous people who called themselves the Veneciuela. Thus, the name \"Venezuela\" may have evolved from the native word.Previously, the official name was Estado de Venezuela (1830\u20131856), Rep\u00fablica de Venezuela (1856\u20131864), Estados Unidos de Venezuela (1864\u20131953), and again Rep\u00fablica de Venezuela (1953\u20131999).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Columbian history ===\n\nEvidence exists of human habitation in the area now known as Venezuela from about 15,000 years ago. Leaf-shaped tools from this period, together with chopping and plano-convex scraping implements, have been found exposed on the high riverine terraces of the Rio Pedregal in western Venezuela. Late Pleistocene hunting artifacts, including spear tips, have been found at a similar series of sites in northwestern Venezuela known as \"El Jobo\"; according to radiocarbon dating, these date from 13,000 to 7,000 BC.It is not known how many people lived in Venezuela before the Spanish conquest; it has been estimated at around one million. In addition to indigenous peoples known today, the population included historical groups such as the Kalina (Caribs), Auak\u00e9, Caquetio, Mariche, and Timoto\u2013Cuicas. The Timoto\u2013Cuica culture was the most complex society in Pre-Columbian Venezuela, with pre-planned permanent villages, surrounded by irrigated, terraced fields. They also stored water in tanks. Their houses were made primarily of stone and wood with thatched roofs. They were peaceful, for the most part, and depended on growing crops. Regional crops included potatoes and ullucos. They left behind works of art, particularly anthropomorphic ceramics, but no major monuments. They spun vegetable fibers to weave into textiles and mats for housing. They are credited with having invented the arepa, a staple in Venezuelan cuisine.After the conquest, the population dropped markedly, mainly through the spread of new infectious diseases from Europe. Two main north\u2013south axes of pre-Columbian population were present, who cultivated maize in the west and manioc in the east. Large parts of the llanos were cultivated through a combination of slash and burn and permanent settled agriculture.\n\n\n=== Colonization ===\n\nIn 1498, during his third voyage to the Americas, Christopher Columbus sailed near the Orinoco Delta and landed in the Gulf of Paria. Amazed by the great offshore current of freshwater which deflected his course eastward, Columbus expressed in a letter to Isabella and Ferdinand that he must have reached Heaven on Earth (terrestrial paradise):\n\nGreat signs are these of the Terrestrial Paradise, for the site conforms to the opinion of the holy and wise theologians whom I have mentioned. And likewise, the [other] signs conform very well, for I have never read or heard of such a large quantity of fresh water being inside and in such close proximity to salt water; the very mild temperateness also corroborates this; and if the water of which I speak does not proceed from Paradise then it is an even greater marvel, because I do not believe such a large and deep river has ever been known to exist in this world.\nSpain's colonization of mainland Venezuela started in 1522, establishing its first permanent South American settlement in the present-day city of Cuman\u00e1. In the 16th century, Venezuela was contracted as a concession by the King of Spain to the German Welser banking family (Klein-Venedig, 1528\u20131546). Native caciques (leaders) such as Guaicaipuro (c.\u20091530\u20131568) and Tamanaco (died 1573) attempted to resist Spanish incursions, but the newcomers ultimately subdued them; Tamanaco was put to death by order of Caracas' founder, Diego de Losada.In the 16th century, during the Spanish colonization, indigenous peoples such as many of the Mariches, themselves descendants of the Kalina, converted to Roman Catholicism. Some of the resisting tribes or leaders are commemorated in place names, including Caracas, Chacao and Los Teques. The early colonial settlements focused on the northern coast, but in the mid-18th century, the Spanish pushed farther inland along the Orinoco River. Here, the Ye'kuana (then known as the Makiritare) organized serious resistance in 1775 and 1776.Spain's eastern Venezuelan settlements were incorporated into New Andalusia Province. Administered by the Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo from the early 16th century, most of Venezuela became part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada in the early 18th century, and was then reorganized as an autonomous Captaincy General starting in 1777. The town of Caracas, founded in the central coastal region in 1567, was well-placed to become a key location, being near the coastal port of La Guaira whilst itself being located in a valley in a mountain range, providing defensive strength against pirates and a more fertile and healthy climate.\n\n\n=== Independence and 19th century ===\n\nAfter a series of unsuccessful uprisings, Venezuela, under the leadership of Francisco de Miranda, a Venezuelan marshal who had fought in the American Revolution and the French Revolution, declared independence as the First Republic of Venezuela on 5 July 1811. This began the Venezuelan War of Independence. A devastating earthquake that struck Caracas in 1812, together with the rebellion of the Venezuelan llaneros, helped bring down the republic. Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, new leader of the independentist forces, launched his Admirable Campaign in 1813 from New Granada, retaking most of the territory and being proclaimed as El Libertador (\"The Liberator\"). A second Venezuelan republic was proclaimed on 7 August 1813, but lasted only a few months before being crushed at the hands of royalist caudillo Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s Boves and his personal army of llaneros.The end of the French invasion of homeland Spain in 1814 allowed the preparation of a large expeditionary force to the American provinces under general Pablo Morillo, with the goal to regain the lost territory in Venezuela and New Granada. As the war reached a stalemate on 1817, Bol\u00edvar reestablished the Third Republic of Venezuela on the territory still controlled by the patriots, mainly in the Guayana and Los Llanos regions. This republic was short-lived as only two years later, during the Congress of Angostura of 1819, the union of Venezuela with New Granada was decreed to form the Republic of Gran Colombia. The war continued for some years, until full victory and sovereignty was attained after Bol\u00edvar, aided by Jos\u00e9 Antonio P\u00e1ez and Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre, won the Battle of Carabobo on 24 June 1821. On 24 July 1823, Jos\u00e9 Prudencio Padilla and Rafael Urdaneta helped seal Venezuelan independence with their victory in the Battle of Lake Maracaibo. New Granada's congress gave Bol\u00edvar control of the Granadian army; leading it, he liberated several countries and founded Gran Colombia.\n\nSucre, who won many battles for Bol\u00edvar, went on to liberate Ecuador and later become the second president of Bolivia. Venezuela remained part of Gran Colombia until 1830, when a rebellion led by P\u00e1ez allowed the proclamation of a newly independent Venezuela; P\u00e1ez became the first president of the new State of Venezuela. Between one-quarter and one-third of Venezuela's population was lost during these two decades of warfare (including perhaps one-half of the white population), which by 1830, was estimated at about 800,000.The colors of the Venezuelan flag are yellow, blue, and red: the yellow stands for land wealth, the blue for the sea that separates Venezuela from Spain, and the red for the blood shed by the heroes of independence.Slavery in Venezuela was abolished in 1854. Much of Venezuela's 19th-century history was characterized by political turmoil and dictatorial rule, including the Independence leader Jos\u00e9 Antonio P\u00e1ez, who gained the presidency three times and served a total of 11 years between 1830 and 1863. This culminated in the Federal War (1859\u20131863), a civil war in which hundreds of thousands died in a country with a population of not much more than a million people. In the latter half of the century, Antonio Guzm\u00e1n Blanco, another caudillo, served a total of 13 years between 1870 and 1887, with three other presidents interspersed.\n\nIn 1895, a longstanding dispute with Great Britain about the territory of Guayana Esequiba, which Britain claimed as part of British Guiana and Venezuela saw as Venezuelan territory, erupted into the Venezuela Crisis of 1895. The dispute became a diplomatic crisis when Venezuela's lobbyist, William L. Scruggs, sought to argue that British behavior over the issue violated the United States' Monroe Doctrine of 1823, and used his influence in Washington, D.C., to pursue the matter. Then, U.S. president Grover Cleveland adopted a broad interpretation of the doctrine that did not just simply forbid new European colonies, but declared an American interest in any matter within the hemisphere. Britain ultimately accepted arbitration, but in negotiations over its terms was able to persuade the U.S. on many of the details. A tribunal convened in Paris in 1898 to decide the issue and in 1899 awarded the bulk of the disputed territory to British Guiana.In 1899, Cipriano Castro, assisted by his friend Juan Vicente G\u00f3mez, seized power in Caracas, marching an army from his base in the Andean state of T\u00e1chira. Castro defaulted on Venezuela's considerable foreign debts and declined to pay compensation to foreigners caught up in Venezuela's civil wars. This led to the Venezuela Crisis of 1902\u20131903, in which Britain, Germany and Italy imposed a naval blockade of several months before international arbitration at the new Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague was agreed. In 1908, another dispute broke out with the Netherlands, which was resolved when Castro left for medical treatment in Germany and was promptly overthrown by Juan Vicente G\u00f3mez (1908\u20131935).\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nThe discovery of massive oil deposits in Lake Maracaibo during World War I proved to be pivotal for Venezuela and transformed the basis of its economy from a heavy dependence on agricultural exports. It prompted an economic boom that lasted into the 1980s; by 1935, Venezuela's per capita gross domestic product was Latin America's highest. G\u00f3mez benefited handsomely from this, as corruption thrived, but at the same time, the new source of income helped him centralize the Venezuelan state and develop its authority.\nHe remained the most powerful man in Venezuela until his death in 1935, although at times he ceded the presidency to others. The gomecista dictatorship (1935\u20131945) system largely continued under Eleazar L\u00f3pez Contreras, but from 1941, under Isa\u00edas Medina Angarita, was relaxed.  Angarita granted a range of reforms, including the legalization of all political parties. After World War II, immigration from Southern Europe (mainly from Spain, Italy, Portugal, and France) and poorer Latin American countries markedly diversified Venezuelan society.\n\nIn 1945, a civilian-military coup overthrew Medina Angarita and ushered in a three-year period of democratic rule (1945\u20131948) under the mass membership party Democratic Action, initially under R\u00f3mulo Betancourt, until R\u00f3mulo Gallegos won the 1947 Venezuelan presidential election (generally believed to be the first free and fair elections in Venezuela). Gallegos governed until overthrown by a military junta led by the triumvirate Luis Felipe Llovera P\u00e1ez, Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez, and Gallegos' Defense Minister, Carlos Delgado Chalbaud, in the 1948 Venezuelan coup d'\u00e9tat.\nThe most powerful man in the military junta (1948\u20131958) was P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez (though Chalbaud was its titular president) and was suspected of being behind the death in office of Chalbaud, who died in a bungled kidnapping in 1950. When the junta unexpectedly lost the election it held in 1952, it ignored the results and P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez was installed as president, where he remained until 1958. The expansion of the Venezuelan economy in this period was based on the indebtedness of the Venezuelan nation and that was one of the causes of the economic crisis in Venezuela in the 1960s, in which important projects such as the Urban Center El Recreo de Marcel Brauer on Avenida Casanova in Sabana Grande district were paralyzed.During the years of P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez's administration, the State intervened in areas of the economy that were traditionally carried out by private companies. The P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez government was characterized by its state capitalism and not by liberal capitalism. It was an antecedent of the populist and paternalistic economic regime of the later democratic regimes. The national private entrepreneurship increasingly had less space to grow and prosper. The State was the great capitalist in the Venezuela of P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez and was the largest national shareholder of major hotel chains such as Sheraton.In the government of P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez, Venezuela's debt grew more than 25 times and went from 175 million to more than 4,500 million bolivares in just 5 years (approximately 15 billion dollars in 2018). The malaise over the debts of Venezuela reached the barracks and the national business. P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez responded that: \"there is no debt, but commitments\". The Finance Minister failed to convince P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez to order the cancellation of debts. As of 14 January 1958, the Venezuelan business community decided to divorce itself completely from the regime, nine days before the collapse of the government. The military dictator P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez was forced out on 23 January 1958. In an effort to consolidate a young democracy, the three major political parties (Acci\u00f3n Democr\u00e1tica (AD), COPEI and Uni\u00f3n Republicana Democr\u00e1tica (URD), with the notable exception of the Communist Party of Venezuela) signed the Puntofijo Pact power-sharing agreement. The two first parties would dominate the political landscape for four decades.\n\nDuring the presidencies of R\u00f3mulo Ernesto Betancourt Bello (1959\u20131964, his second time) and Ra\u00fal Leoni Otero (1964\u20131969) in the 1960s, substantial guerilla movements occurred, including the Armed Forces of National Liberation and the Revolutionary Left Movement, which had split from AD in 1960. Most of these movements laid down their arms under Rafael Caldera's first presidency (1969\u20131974); Caldera had won the 1968 election for COPEI, being the first time a party other than Democratic Action took the presidency through a democratic election. The new democratic order had its antagonists. Betancourt suffered an attack planned by the Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo in 1960, and the leftists excluded from the Pact initiated an armed insurgency by organizing themselves in the Armed Forces of National Liberation, sponsored by the Communist Party and Fidel Castro. In 1962 they tried to destabilize the military corps, with failed revolts in Car\u00fapano and Puerto Cabello. At the same time, Betancourt promoted an international doctrine in which he only recognized elected governments by popular vote.As a result of the debt that Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez had left, an economic adjustment program was necessary in Venezuela. The Economic Recovery Plan of 1960 was formulated by Tom\u00e1s Enrique Carrillo Batalla. The construction industry was revitalized through the \"rediscount\" of the Central Bank of Venezuela. The Economic Recovery Plan fulfilled its objectives and in 1964, Venezuela was able to return to an anchored exchange rate, with free purchase and sale of foreign currency. This system lasted until the Venezuelan Black Friday of 1983, although the model was already running out at the end of the seventies. The consolidation of the democratic system and the dissipation of fears of political radicalization of the country contributed to normalize the demand for foreign currency, stabilizing the parallel exchange rate.\nFor much of the period between 1950 and 1973, the Venezuelan economy was characterized by its stability and sustained strength, factors that contributed decisively to being able to maintain a fixed exchange rate without major inconveniences. In the period of Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez (1974\u20131979, his first time as president), as a result of the Arab-Israeli war (the Yom Kippur war), the average price of a barrel of oil went from 3.71 to 10.53 dollars and continued to rise to exceed 29 dollars in 1981. The income of the public sector went from 18,960 million bolivars in 1973 to 45.564 million in 1974. The economic bonanza also had the characteristics of an economic bubble, but Venezuelans remember the \"Ta barato, dame dos\". The increased inflow of funds to savings and loan entities and mortgage banks allowed an increase in the mortgage loan portfolio, which also tripled. In general, Venezuela was a prosperous country in the governments of R\u00f3mulo Betancourt (1945 \u2013 c.\u20091948; 1959\u20131964), Rafael Caldera (1969\u20131974; 1994 \u2013 c.\u20091999) and Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez (1974\u20131979; 1989 \u2013 c.\u20091993). In 1975 the iron industry was nationalized and the following year the oil industry, creating Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA). Both Caldera and P\u00e9rez partially broke with the Betancourt Doctrine.\n\nThe election in 1973 of Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez coincided with an oil crisis, in which Venezuela's income exploded as oil prices soared; oil industries were nationalized in 1976. This led to massive increases in public spending, but also increases in external debts, which continued into the 1980s when the collapse of oil prices during the 1980s crippled the Venezuelan economy. As the government started to devalue the currency in February 1983 to face its financial obligations, Venezuelans' real standards of living fell dramatically. A number of failed economic policies and increasing corruption in government led to rising poverty and crime, worsening social indicators, and increased political instability.During the presidency of Luis Herrera Campins (1979\u20131984), important infrastructure works were completed, such as the Parque Central Complex (which became the largest housing complex and the tallest towers in Latin America), Teresa Carre\u00f1o Cultural Complex (the largest cultural center in South America at that time), the Br\u00edgido Iriarte Stadium and the United Nations Park. Most of these works had been previously planned. Until the mid-eighties, the Venezuelan economy showed a very positive behavior, characterized by the absence of internal or external imbalances, high economic growth, largely due to the sustained and very high gross fixed investment of those years, 10 under unemployment and great price stability. This translated into sustained increases in the average real wage and an improvement in the condition of life.\n\nThe bolivar was devalued in February 1983, unleashing a strong economic crisis, which hit investments in the most important financial centers of the Venezuelan capital, such as Sabana Grande. In the government of Jaime Lusinchi (1984\u20131989), an attempt was made to solve the problem. Unfortunately, the measures failed. After a long period of accelerated economic expansion that lasts for six decades (value of the stock of homes by families), an extreme higher value is reached towards 1982. From this historical value begins then a systematic fall that mounts to 26 hundred up to 2006, and that configures a genuine unique experience in contemporary economic life. However, the economic deactivation of the country had begun to show its first signs in 1978.In the 1980s, the Presidential Commission for State Reform (COPRE) emerged as a mechanism of political innovation. Venezuela was preparing for the decentralization of its political system and the diversification of its economy, reducing the large size of the State. The COPRE operated as an innovation mechanism, also by incorporating issues into the political agenda that were generally excluded from public deliberation by the main actors of the Venezuelan democratic system. The most discussed topics were incorporated into the public agenda: decentralization, political participation, municipalization, judicial oder reforms and the role of the State in a new economic strategy. Unfortunately, the social reality of the country made the changes difficult to apply.Economic crises in the 1980s and 1990s led to a political crisis in which hundreds died in the Caracazo riots of 1989 during the presidency of Carlos Andres P\u00e9rez (1989\u20131993, his second time), two attempted coups d'\u00e9tat in 1992 (February and November) by Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, and the impeachment of President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez (re-elected in 1988) for corruption in 1993 and the interim presidency of Ram\u00f3n Jos\u00e9 Vel\u00e1squez (1993\u20131994). Coup leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez was pardoned in March 1994 by president Rafael Caldera (1994\u20131999, his second time), with a clean slate and his political rights reinstated. This let him later get the presidency continuously from 1999 until his death in 2013, winning the elections of 1998, 2000, 2006 and 2012 and the presidential referendum of 2004, with the only exception in 2002 of Pedro Carmona Estanga as a two-day de facto government and Diosdado Cabello Rond\u00f3n as a few-hours interim president.\n\n\n=== Bolivarian government: 1999\u2013present ===\n\nThe Bolivarian Revolution refers to a left-wing populism social movement and political process in Venezuela led by Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who founded the Fifth Republic Movement in 1997 and the United Socialist Party of Venezuela in 2007. The \"Bolivarian Revolution\" is named after Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, an early 19th-century Venezuelan and Latin American revolutionary leader, prominent in the Spanish American wars of independence in achieving the independence of most of northern South America from Spanish rule. According to Ch\u00e1vez and other supporters, the \"Bolivarian Revolution\" seeks to build a mass movement to implement Bolivarianism\u2014popular democracy, economic independence, equitable distribution of revenues, and an end to political corruption\u2014in Venezuela. They interpret Bol\u00edvar's ideas from a populist perspective, using socialist rhetoric.\n\n\n==== Hugo Ch\u00e1vez: 1999\u20132013 ====\n\nA collapse in confidence in the existing parties led to Ch\u00e1vez being elected president in 1998 and the subsequent launch of a \"Bolivarian Revolution\", beginning with a 1999 Constituent Assembly to write a new Constitution of Venezuela. Ch\u00e1vez also initiated Bolivarian missions, programs aimed at helping the poor.In April 2002, Ch\u00e1vez was briefly ousted from power in the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'\u00e9tat attempt following popular demonstrations by his opponents, but he returned to power after two days as a result of demonstrations by poor Ch\u00e1vez supporters in Caracas and actions by the military.Ch\u00e1vez also remained in power after an all-out national strike that lasted from December 2002 to February 2003, including a strike/lockout in the state oil company PDVSA. The strike produced severe economic dislocation, with the country's GDP falling 27% during the first four months of 2003, and costing the oil industry $13.3 billion. Capital flight before and during the strike led to the reimposition of currency controls (which had been abolished in 1989), managed by the CADIVI agency. In the subsequent decade, the government was forced into several currency devaluations. These devaluations have done little to improve the situation of the Venezuelan people who rely on imported products or locally produced products that depend on imported inputs while dollar-denominated oil sales account for the vast majority of Venezuela's exports. According to Sebastian Boyd writing at Bloomberg News, the profits of the oil industry have been lost to \"social engineering\" and corruption, instead of investments needed to maintain oil production.Ch\u00e1vez survived several further political tests, including an August 2004 recall referendum. He was elected for another term in December 2006 and re-elected for a third term in October 2012. However, he was never sworn in for his third period, due to medical complications. Ch\u00e1vez died on 5 March 2013 after a nearly two-year fight with cancer. The presidential election that took place on Sunday, 14 April 2013, was the first since Ch\u00e1vez took office in 1999 in which his name did not appear on the ballot.\n\n\n==== Nicol\u00e1s Maduro: 2013\u2013present ====\n\nPoverty and inflation began to increase into the 2010s. Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was elected in 2013 after the death of Chavez. Chavez picked Maduro as his successor and appointed him vice president in 2013. Maduro was elected president in a shortened election in 2013 following Chavez's death.Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has been the president of Venezuela since 14 April 2013, after winning the second presidential election after Ch\u00e1vez's death, with 50.61% of the votes against the opposition's candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski who had 49.12% of the votes. The Democratic Unity Roundtable contested his election as fraud and as a violation of the constitution. An audit of 56% of the vote showed no discrepancies, and the Supreme Court of Venezuela ruled that under Venezuela's Constitution, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is the legitimate president and was invested as such by the Venezuelan National Assembly (Asamblea Nacional). Opposition leaders and some international media consider the government of Maduro to be a dictatorship. Beginning in February 2014, hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans have protested over high levels of criminal violence, corruption, hyperinflation, and chronic scarcity of basic goods due to policies of the federal government. Demonstrations and riots have left over 40 fatalities in the unrest between both Chavistas and opposition protesters, and has led to the arrest of opposition leaders including Leopoldo L\u00f3pez and Antonio Ledezma. Human rights groups have strongly condemned the arrest of Leopoldo L\u00f3pez.In the 2015 Venezuelan parliamentary election, the opposition gained a majority.Venezuela devalued its currency in February 2013 due to the rising shortages in the country, which included those of milk, flour, and other necessities. This led to an increase in malnutrition, especially among children. Venezuela's economy had become strongly dependent on the exportation of oil with Crude accounting for 86% of exports, and a high price per barrel to support social programs. Beginning in 2014 the price of oil plummeted from over $100/bbl to $40/bbl a year and a half later, this placed great pressure on the Venezuelan economy, which was no longer able to afford vast social programs. To counter the decrease in oil prices, the Venezuelan Government began taking more money from PDVSA, the state oil company, to meet budgets resulting in a lack of reinvestment in fields and employees. This has seen Venezuela's oil production decrease from its height of nearly 3 to 1 million barrels (480 to 160 thousand cubic metres) per day. In 2014, Venezuela entered an economic recession. In 2015, Venezuela had the world's highest inflation rate with the rate surpassing 100%, becoming the highest in the country's history. In 2017, Donald Trump's administration imposed more economic sanctions against Venezuela's state-owned oil company PDVSA and Venezuelan officials. Economic problems, as well as crime and corruption, were some of the main causes of the 2014\u2013present Venezuelan protests. Since 2015 nearly 2 million people have fled Venezuela.In January 2016, President Maduro decreed an \"economic emergency\" revealing the extent of the crisis and expanding his powers. In July 2016, Colombian border crossings were temporarily opened to allow Venezuelans to purchase food and basic household and health items in Colombia. In September 2016, a study published in the Spanish-language Diario Las Am\u00e9ricas indicated that 15% of Venezuelans are eating \"food waste discarded by commercial establishments\".\nClose to 200 riots had occurred in Venezuelan prisons by October 2016, according to Una Ventana a la Libertad, an advocacy group for better prison conditions. The father of an inmate at T\u00e1chira Detention Center in Caracas alleged that his son was cannibalized by other inmates during a month-long riot, a claim corroborated by an anonymous police source but denied by the Minister of Correctional Affairs.\n\nIn 2017, Venezuela experienced a constitutional crisis in the country. In March 2017, opposition leaders branded President Nicolas Maduro a dictator after the Maduro-aligned Supreme Tribunal, which had been overturning most National Assembly decisions since the opposition took control of the body, took over the functions of the assembly, pushing a lengthy political standoff to new heights. However, the Supreme Court quickly backed down and reversed its decision on 1 April 2017. A month later, President Maduro announced the 2017 Venezuelan Constituent Assembly election and on 30 August 2017, the 2017 Constituent National Assembly was elected into office and quickly stripped the National Assembly of its powers.\nIn December 2017, President Maduro declared that leading opposition parties will be barred from taking part in next year's presidential vote after they boycotted mayoral polls.Maduro won the 2018 election with 67.8% of the vote. The result was challenged by countries including Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, France and the United States who deemed it fraudulent and moved to recognize Juan Guaid\u00f3 as president. Other countries including Cuba, China, Russia, Turkey, and Iran have continued to recognize Maduro as president, although China, facing financial pressure over its position, has reportedly begun hedging its position by decreasing loans given, cancelling joint ventures, and signaling willingness to work with all parties. A Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman denied the reports, describing them as \"false information\".In January 2019 the Permanent Council of the Organization of American States (OAS) approved a resolution \"to not recognize the legitimacy of Nicolas Maduro's new term as of the 10th of January of 2019,\" while the United Nations General Assembly formally recognized the Maduro government as the only legitimate representative of Venezuela at the United Nations and in October 2019, Venezuela was elected to the United Nations Human Rights Council.In August 2019, United States President Donald Trump signed an executive order to impose a total economic embargo against Venezuela. Later, in March 2020, the Trump administration indicted Maduro and several Venezuelan officials with drug trafficking.In June 2020, a detailed report by Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights documented enforced disappearances in Venezuela, specifically those that occurred during the years 2018 and 2019. During the period, around 724 enforced disappearances of political detainees were reported. Venezuelan security forces have disappeared their victims, subjecting them to illegal interrogation processes accompanied by torture and cruel or inhuman treatment. Venezuela's Bolivarian regime has strategically used enforced disappearances to silence political opponents and other critical voices it deems a threat.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nVenezuela is located in the north of South America; geologically, its mainland rests on the South American Plate. It has a total area of 916,445 km2 (353,841 sq mi) and a land area of 882,050 km2 (340,560 sq mi), making Venezuela the 33rd largest country in the world. The territory it controls lies between latitudes 0\u00b0 and 13\u00b0N and longitudes 59\u00b0 and 74\u00b0W.\nShaped roughly like a triangle, the country has a 2,800 km (1,700 mi) coastline in the north, which includes numerous islands in the Caribbean and the northeast borders the northern Atlantic Ocean. Most observers describe Venezuela in terms of four fairly well defined topographical regions: the Maracaibo lowlands in the northwest, the northern mountains extending in a broad east\u2013west arc from the Colombian border along the northern Caribbean coast, the wide plains in central Venezuela, and the Guiana Highlands in the southeast.\nThe northern mountains are the extreme northeastern extensions of South America's Andes mountain range. Pico Bol\u00edvar, the nation's highest point at 4,979 m (16,335 ft), lies in this region. To the south, the dissected Guiana Highlands contain the northern fringes of the Amazon Basin and Angel Falls, the world's highest waterfall, as well as tepuis, large table-like mountains. The country's center is characterized by the llanos, which are extensive plains that stretch from the Colombian border in the far west to the Orinoco River delta in the east. The Orinoco, with its rich alluvial soils, binds the largest and most important river system of the country; it originates in one of the largest watersheds in Latin America. The Caron\u00ed and the Apure are other major rivers.\nVenezuela borders Colombia to the west, Guyana to the east, and Brazil to the south. Caribbean islands such as Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, Cura\u00e7ao, Aruba, and the Leeward Antilles lie near the Venezuelan coast. Venezuela has territorial disputes with Guyana, formerly United Kingdom, largely concerning the Essequibo area and with Colombia concerning the Gulf of Venezuela. In 1895, after years of diplomatic attempts to solve the border dispute, the dispute over the Essequibo River border flared up. It was submitted to a \"neutral\" commission (composed of British, American, and Russian representatives and without a direct Venezuelan representative), which in 1899 decided mostly against Venezuela's claim.Venezuela's most significant natural resources are petroleum and natural gas, iron ore, gold, and other minerals. It also has large areas of arable land and water.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nVenezuela is entirely located in the tropics over the Equator to around 12\u00b0 N. Its climate varies from humid low-elevation plains, where average annual temperatures range as high as 35 \u00b0C (95.0 \u00b0F), to glaciers and highlands (the p\u00e1ramos) with an average yearly temperature of 8 \u00b0C (46.4 \u00b0F). Annual rainfall varies from 430 mm (16.9 in) in the semiarid portions of the northwest to over 1,000 mm (39.4 in) in the Orinoco Delta of the far east and the Amazonian Jungle in the south. The precipitation level is lower in the period from August through April. These periods are referred to as hot-humid and cold-dry seasons. Another characteristic of the climate is this variation throughout the country by the existence of a mountain range called \"Cordillera de la Costa\" which crosses the country from east to west. The majority of the population lives in these mountains.The country falls into four horizontal temperature zones based primarily on elevation, having tropical, dry, temperate with dry winters, and polar (alpine tundra) climates, amongst others. In the tropical zone\u2014below 800 m (2,625 ft)\u2014temperatures are hot, with yearly averages ranging between 26 and 28 \u00b0C (78.8 and 82.4 \u00b0F). The temperate zone ranges between 800 and 2,000 m (2,625 and 6,562 ft) with averages from 12 to 25 \u00b0C (53.6 to 77.0 \u00b0F); many of Venezuela's cities, including the capital, lie in this region. Colder conditions with temperatures from 9 to 11 \u00b0C (48.2 to 51.8 \u00b0F) are found in the cool zone between 2,000 and 3,000 m (6,562 and 9,843 ft), especially in the Venezuelan Andes, where pastureland and permanent snowfield with yearly averages below 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F) cover land above 3,000 meters (9,843 ft) in the p\u00e1ramos.\n\nThe highest temperature recorded was 42 \u00b0C (108 \u00b0F) in Machiques, and the lowest temperature recorded was \u221211 \u00b0C (12 \u00b0F), it has been reported from an uninhabited high altitude at P\u00e1ramo de Piedras Blancas (M\u00e9rida state), even though no official reports exist, lower temperatures in the mountains of the Sierra Nevada de M\u00e9rida are known.\n\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\n\nVenezuela lies within the Neotropical realm; large portions of the country were originally covered by moist broadleaf forests. One of 17 megadiverse countries, Venezuela's habitats range from the Andes Mountains in the west to the Amazon Basin rainforest in the south, via extensive llanos plains and Caribbean coast in the center and the Orinoco River Delta in the east. They include xeric scrublands in the extreme northwest and coastal mangrove forests in the northeast. Its cloud forests and lowland rainforests are particularly rich.Animals of Venezuela are diverse and include manatees, three-toed sloth, two-toed sloth, Amazon river dolphins, and Orinoco Crocodiles, which have been reported to reach up to 6.6 m (22 ft) in length. Venezuela hosts a total of 1,417 bird species, 48 of which are endemic. Important birds include ibises, ospreys, kingfishers, and the yellow-orange Venezuelan troupial, the national bird. Notable mammals include the giant anteater, jaguar, and the capybara, the world's largest rodent. More than half of Venezuelan avian and mammalian species are found in the Amazonian forests south of the Orinoco.For the fungi, an account was provided by R.W.G. Dennis which has been digitized and the records made available on-line as part of the Cybertruffle Robigalia database. That database includes nearly 3,900 species of fungi recorded from Venezuela, but is far from complete, and the true total number of fungal species already known from Venezuela is likely higher, given the generally accepted estimate that only about 7% of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered.Among plants of Venezuela, over 25,000 species of orchids are found in the country's cloud forest and lowland rainforest ecosystems. These include the flor de mayo orchid (Cattleya mossiae), the national flower. Venezuela's national tree is the araguaney, whose characteristic lushness after the rainy season led novelist R\u00f3mulo Gallegos to name it \"[l]a primavera de oro de los araguaneyes\" (the golden spring of the araguaneyes). The tops of the tepuis are also home to several carnivorous plants including the marsh pitcher plant, Heliamphora, and the insectivorous bromeliad, Brocchinia reducta.\nVenezuela is among the top 20 countries in terms of endemism. Among its animals, 23% of reptilian and 50% of amphibian species are endemic. Although the available information is still very small, a first effort has been made to estimate the number of fungal species endemic to Venezuela: 1334 species of fungi have been tentatively identified as possible endemics of the country. Some 38% of the over 21,000 plant species known from Venezuela are unique to the country.\n\n\n=== Environment ===\n\nVenezuela is one of the 10 most biodiverse countries on the planet, yet it is one of the leaders of deforestation due to economic and political factors. Each year, roughly 287,600 hectares of forest are permanently destroyed and other areas are degraded by mining, oil extraction, and logging. Between 1990 and 2005, Venezuela officially lost 8.3% of its forest cover, which is about 4.3 million ha. In response, federal protections for critical habitat were implemented; for example, 20% to 33% of forested land is protected. The country's biosphere reserve is part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention. In 2003, 70% of the nation's land was under conservation management in over 200 protected areas, including 43 national parks. Venezuela's 43 national parks include Canaima National Park, Morrocoy National Park, and Mochima National Park. In the far south is a reserve for the country's Yanomami tribes. Covering 32,000 square miles (82,880 square kilometres), the area is off-limits to farmers, miners, and all non-Yanomami settlers.\nVenezuela was one of the few countries that did not enter an INDC at COP21. Many terrestrial ecosystems are considered endangered, specially the dry forest in the northern regions of the country and the coral reefs in the Caribbean coast.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nFollowing the fall of Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez in 1958, Venezuelan politics were dominated by the Third Way Christian democratic COPEI and the center-left social democratic Democratic Action (AD) parties; this two-party system was formalized by the puntofijismo arrangement. Economic crises in the 1980s and 1990s led to a political crisis which resulted in hundreds dead in the Caracazo riots of 1989, two attempted coups in 1992, and impeachment of President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez for corruption in 1993. A collapse in confidence in the existing parties saw the 1998 election of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who had led the first of the 1992 coup attempts, and the launch of a \"Bolivarian Revolution\", beginning with a 1999 Constituent Assembly to write a new Constitution of Venezuela.\nThe opposition's attempts to unseat Ch\u00e1vez included the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'\u00e9tat attempt, the Venezuelan general strike of 2002\u20132003, and the Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004, all of which failed. Ch\u00e1vez was re-elected in December 2006 but suffered a significant defeat in 2007 with the narrow rejection of the 2007 Venezuelan constitutional referendum, which had offered two packages of constitutional reforms aimed at deepening the Bolivarian Revolution.\nTwo major blocs of political parties are in Venezuela: the incumbent leftist bloc United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), its major allies Fatherland for All (PPT) and the Communist Party of Venezuela (PCV), and the opposition bloc grouped into the electoral coalition Mesa de la Unidad Democr\u00e1tica. This includes A New Era (UNT) together with allied parties Project Venezuela, Justice First, Movement for Socialism (MAS) and others. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the central figure of the Venezuelan political landscape since his election to the presidency in 1998 as a political outsider, died in office in early 2013, and was succeeded by Nicol\u00e1s Maduro (initially as interim president, before narrowly winning the 2013 Venezuelan presidential election).\nThe Venezuelan president is elected by a vote, with direct and universal suffrage, and is both head of state and head of government. The term of office is six years, and (as of 15 February 2009) a president may be re-elected an unlimited number of times. The president appoints the vice president and decides the size and composition of the cabinet and makes appointments to it with the involvement of the legislature. The president can ask the legislature to reconsider portions of laws he finds objectionable, but a simple parliamentary majority can override these objections.\nThe president may ask the National Assembly to pass an enabling act granting the ability to rule by decree in specified policy areas; this requires a two-thirds majority in the Assembly. Since 1959, six Venezuelan presidents have been granted such powers.\nThe unicameral Venezuelan parliament is the Asamblea Nacional (\"National Assembly\"). The number of members is variable \u2013 each state and the Capital district elect three representatives plus the result of dividing the state population by 1.1% of the total population of the country. Three seats are reserved for representatives of Venezuela's indigenous peoples. For the 2011\u20132016 period the number of seats is 165. All deputies serve five-year terms.\nThe voting age in Venezuela is 18 and older. Voting is not compulsory.The legal system of Venezuela belongs to the Continental Law tradition. The highest judicial body is the Supreme Tribunal of Justice or Tribunal Supremo de Justicia, whose magistrates are elected by parliament for a single two-year term. The National Electoral Council (Consejo Nacional Electoral, or CNE) is in charge of electoral processes; it is formed by five main directors elected by the National Assembly. Supreme Court president Luisa Estela Morales said in December 2009 that Venezuela had moved away from \"a rigid division of powers\" toward a system characterized by \"intense coordination\" between the branches of government. Morales clarified that each power must be independent adding that \"one thing is separation of powers and another one is division\".\n\n\n=== Suspension of constitutional rights ===\n\nThe 2015 parliamentary elections were held on 6 December 2015 to elect the 164 deputies and three indigenous representatives of the National Assembly. In 2014, a series of protest and demonstrations began in Venezuela, attributed to inflation, violence and shortages in Venezuela. The government has accused the protest of being motivated by fascists, opposition leaders, capitalism and foreign influence, despite being largely peaceful.President Maduro acknowledged PSUV defeat, but attributed the opposition's victory to an intensification of an economic war. Despite this, Maduro said \"I will stop by hook or by crook the opposition coming to power, whatever the costs, in any way\". In the following months, Maduro fulfilled his promise of preventing the democratically and constitutionally elected National Assembly from legislating. The first steps taken by PSUV and government were the substitution of the entire Supreme court a day after the Parliamentary Elections contrary to the Constitution of Venezuela, acclaimed as a fraud by the majority of the Venezuelan and international press. The Financial Times described the function of the Supreme Court in Venezuela as \"rubber stamping executive whims and vetoing legislation\". The PSUV government used this violation to suspend several elected opponents, ignoring again the Constitution of Venezuela. Maduro said that \"the Amnesty law (approved by the Parliament) will not be executed\" and asked the Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional before the law was known.On 16 January 2016, Maduro approved an unconstitutional economic emergency decree, relegating to his own figure the legislative and executive powers, while also holding judiciary power through the fraudulent designation of judges the day after the election on 6 December 2015. From these events, Maduro effectively controls all three branches of government. On 14 May 2016, constitutional guarantees were in fact suspended when Maduro decreed the extension of the economic emergency decree for another 60 days and declared a State of Emergency, which is a clear violation of the Constitution of Venezuela in the Article 338th: \"The approval of the extension of States of emergency corresponds to the National Assembly.\" Thus, constitutional rights in Venezuela are considered suspended in fact by many publications and public figures.On 14 May 2016, the Organization of American States was considering the application of the Inter-American Democratic Charter sanctions for non-compliance to its own constitution.\nIn March 2017, the Venezuelan Supreme Court took over law making powers from the National Assembly but reversed its decision the following day.\n\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n\nThroughout most of the 20th century, Venezuela maintained friendly relations with most Latin American and Western nations. Relations between Venezuela and the United States government worsened in 2002, after the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'\u00e9tat attempt during which the U.S. government recognized the short-lived interim presidency of Pedro Carmona. In 2015, Venezuela was declared a national security threat by U.S. president Barack Obama. Correspondingly, ties to various Latin American and Middle Eastern countries not allied to the U.S. have strengthened. For example, Palestinian foreign minister Riyad al-Maliki declared in 2015 that Venezuela was his country's \"most important ally\".Venezuela seeks alternative hemispheric integration via such proposals as the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas trade proposal and the newly launched Latin American television network teleSUR. Venezuela is one of five nations in the world\u2014along with Russia, Nicaragua, Nauru, and Syria\u2014to have recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Venezuela was a proponent of OAS's decision to adopt its Anti-Corruption Convention and is actively working in the Mercosur trade bloc to push increased trade and energy integration. Globally, it seeks a \"multi-polar\" world based on strengthened ties among undeveloped countries.\n\nOn 26 April 2017, Venezuela announced its intention to withdraw from the OAS. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodr\u00edguez said that President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro plans to publicly renounce Venezuela's membership on 27 April 2017. It will take two years for the country to formally leave. During this period, the country does not plan on participating in the OAS.Venezuela is involved in a long-standing disagreement about the control of the Guayana Esequiba area.\nVenezuela may suffer a deterioration of its power in international affairs if the global transition to renewable energy is completed. It is ranked 151 out of 156 countries in the index of Geopolitical Gains and Losses after energy transition (GeGaLo).\n\n\n=== Military ===\n\nThe Bolivarian National Armed Forces of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana, FANB) are the overall unified military forces of Venezuela. It includes over 320,150 men and women, under Article 328 of the Constitution, in 5 components of Ground, Sea and Air. The components of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces are: the Venezuelan Army, the Venezuelan Navy, the Venezuelan Air Force, the Venezuelan National Guard, and the Venezuelan National Militia.\nAs of 2008, a further 600,000 soldiers were incorporated into a new branch, known as the Armed Reserve. The president of Venezuela is the commander-in-chief of the national armed forces. The main roles of the armed forces are to defend the sovereign national territory of Venezuela, airspace, and islands, fight against drug trafficking, to search and rescue and, in the case of a natural disaster, civil protection. All male citizens of Venezuela have a constitutional duty to register for the military service at the age of 18, which is the age of majority in Venezuela.\n\n\n=== Law and crime ===\n\nIn Venezuela, a person is murdered every 21 minutes. Violent crimes have been so prevalent in Venezuela that the government no longer produces the crime data. In 2013, the homicide rate was approximately 79 per 100,000, one of the world's highest, having quadrupled in the past 15 years with over 200,000 people murdered. By 2015, it had risen to 90 per 100,000. The country's body count of the previous decade mimics that of the Iraq War and in some instances had more civilian deaths even though the country is at peacetime. The capital Caracas has one of the greatest homicide rates of any large city in the world, with 122 homicides per 100,000 residents. In 2008, polls indicated that crime was the number one concern of voters. Attempts at fighting crime such as Operation Liberation of the People were implemented to crack down on gang-controlled areas but, of reported criminal acts, less than 2% are prosecuted. In 2017, the Financial Times noted that some of the arms procured by the government over the previous two decades had been diverted to paramilitary civilian groups and criminal syndicates.Venezuela is especially dangerous for foreign travelers and investors who are visiting. The United States Department of State and the Government of Canada have warned foreign visitors that they may be subjected to robbery, kidnapping for a ransom or sale to terrorist organizations and murder, and that their own diplomatic travelers are required to travel in armored vehicles. The United Kingdom's Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised against all travel to Venezuela. Visitors have been murdered during robberies and criminals do not discriminate among their victims. Former Miss Venezuela 2004 winner M\u00f3nica Spear and her ex-husband were murdered and their 5-year-old daughter was shot while vacationing in Venezuela, and an elderly German tourist was murdered only a few weeks later.There are approximately 33 prisons holding about 50,000 inmates. They include; El Rodeo outside of Caracas, Yare Prison in the northern state of Miranda, and several others. Venezuela's prison system is heavily overcrowded; its facilities have capacity for only 14,000 prisoners.\n\n\n==== Corruption ====\n\nCorruption in Venezuela is high by world standards and was so for much of the 20th century. The discovery of oil had worsened political corruption, and by the late 1970s, Juan Pablo P\u00e9rez Alfonso's description of oil as \"the Devil's excrement\" had become a common expression in Venezuela. Venezuela has been ranked one of the most corrupt countries on the Corruption Perceptions Index since the survey started in 1995. The 2010 ranking placed Venezuela at number 164, out of 178 ranked countries in government transparency. By 2016, the rank had increased to 166 out of 178. Similarly, the World Justice Project ranked Venezuela 99th out of 99 countries surveyed in its 2014 Rule of Law Index.This corruption is shown with Venezuela's significant involvement in drug trafficking, with Colombian cocaine and other drugs transiting Venezuela towards the United States and Europe. In the period 2003 - 2008 Venezuelan authorities seized the fifth largest total quantity of cocaine in the world, behind Colombia, the United States, Spain and Panama. In 2006, the government's agency for combating illegal drug trade in Venezuela, ONA, was incorporated into the office of the vice-president of the country. However, many major government and military officials have been known for their involvement with drug trafficking; especially with the October 2013 incident of men from the Venezuelan National Guard placing 1.3 tons of cocaine on a Paris flight knowing they will not face charges.\n\n\n== Administrative Divisions ==\n\nVenezuela is divided into 23 states (estados), a capital district (distrito capital) corresponding to the city of Caracas, and the Federal Dependencies (Dependencias Federales, a special territory). Venezuela is further subdivided into 335 municipalities (municipios); these are subdivided into over one thousand parishes (parroquias). The states are grouped into nine administrative regions (regiones administrativas), which were established in 1969 by presidential decree.\nThe country can be further divided into ten geographical areas, some corresponding to climatic and biogeographical regions. In the north are the Venezuelan Andes and the Coro region, a mountainous tract in the northwest, holds several sierras and valleys. East of it are lowlands abutting Lake Maracaibo and the Gulf of Venezuela.\nThe Central Range runs parallel to the coast and includes the hills surrounding Caracas; the Eastern Range, separated from the Central Range by the Gulf of Cariaco, covers all of Sucre and northern Monagas. The Insular Region includes all of Venezuela's island possessions: Nueva Esparta and the various Federal Dependencies. The Orinoco Delta, which forms a triangle covering Delta Amacuro, projects northeast into the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\n=== Largest cities ===\n\n\n=== Largest metropolitan areas ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nVenezuela has a market-based mixed economy dominated by the petroleum sector, which accounts for roughly a third of GDP, around 80% of exports, and more than half of government revenues. Per capita GDP for 2016 was estimated to be US$15,100, ranking 109th in the world. Venezuela has the least expensive petrol in the world because the consumer price of petrol is heavily subsidized. The private sector controls two-thirds of Venezuela's economy.The Central Bank of Venezuela is responsible for developing monetary policy for the Venezuelan bol\u00edvar which is used as currency. The president of the Central Bank of Venezuela serves as the country's representative in the International Monetary Fund.  The U.S.-based conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, cited in The Wall Street Journal, claims Venezuela has the weakest property rights in the world, scoring only 5.0 on a scale of 100; expropriation without compensation is not uncommon.\nAs of 2011, more than 60% of Venezuela's international reserves was in gold, eight times more than the average for the region. Most of Venezuela's gold held abroad was located in London. On 25 November 2011, the first of US$11 billion of repatriated gold bullion arrived in Caracas; Ch\u00e1vez called the repatriation of gold a \"sovereign\" step that will help protect the country's foreign reserves from the turmoil in the U.S. and Europe. However government policies quickly spent down this returned gold and in 2013 the government was forced to add the dollar reserves of state owned companies to those of the national bank to reassure the international bond market.\n\nManufacturing contributed 17% of GDP in 2006. Venezuela manufactures and exports heavy industry products such as steel, aluminium and cement, with production concentrated around Ciudad Guayana, near the Guri Dam, one of the largest in the world and the provider of about three-quarters of Venezuela's electricity. Other notable manufacturing includes electronics and automobiles, as well as beverages, and foodstuffs. Agriculture in Venezuela accounts for approximately 3% of GDP, 10% of the labor force, and at least a quarter of Venezuela's land area. The country is not self-sufficient in most areas of agriculture. In 2012, total food consumption was over 26 million metric tonnes, a 94.8% increase from 2003.Since the discovery of oil in the early 20th century, Venezuela has been one of the world's leading exporters of oil, and it is a founding member of OPEC. Previously an underdeveloped exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and cocoa, oil quickly came to dominate exports and government revenues. The 1980s oil glut led to an external debt crisis and a long-running economic crisis, which saw inflation peak at 100% in 1996 and poverty rates rise to 66% in 1995 as (by 1998) per capita GDP fell to the same level as 1963, down a third from its 1978 peak. The 1990s also saw Venezuela experience a major banking crisis in 1994.\n\nThe recovery of oil prices after 2001 boosted the Venezuelan economy and facilitated social spending. With social programs such as the Bolivarian Missions, Venezuela initially made progress in social development in the 2000s, particularly in areas such as health, education, and poverty. Many of the social policies pursued by Ch\u00e1vez and his administration were jump-started by the Millennium Development Goals, eight goals that Venezuela and 188 other nations agreed to in September 2000. The sustainability of the Bolivarian Missions has been questioned due to the Bolivarian state's overspending on public works and because the Ch\u00e1vez government did not save funds for future economic hardships like other OPEC nations; with economic issues and poverty rising as a result of their policies in the 2010s. In 2003 the government of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez implemented currency controls after capital flight led to a devaluation of the currency. This led to the development of a parallel market of dollars in the subsequent years. The fallout of the 2008 global financial crisis saw a renewed economic downturn. Despite controversial data shared by the Venezuelan government showing that the country had halved malnutrition following one of the UN's Millennium Development Goals, shortages of staple goods began to occur in Venezuela and malnutrition began to increase.In early 2013, Venezuela devalued its currency due to growing shortages in the country. The shortages included, and still include, necessities such as toilet paper, milk, and flour. Fears rose so high due to the toilet paper shortage that the government occupied a toilet paper factory, and continued further plans to nationalize other industrial aspects like food distribution. Venezuela's bond ratings have also decreased multiple times in 2013 due to decisions by the president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. One of his decisions was to force stores and their warehouses to sell all of their products, which led to even more shortages in the future. In 2016, consumer prices in Venezuela increased 800% and the economy declined by 18.6%, entering an economic depression. Venezuela's outlook was deemed negative by most bond-rating services in 2017. For 2018 an inflation rate of 1,000,000 percent was projected, putting Venezuela in a similar situation to that in Germany in 1923 or Zimbabwe in the late 2000s.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism has been developed considerably in recent decades, particularly because of its favorable geographical position, the variety of landscapes, the richness of plant and wildlife, the artistic expressions and the privileged tropical climate of the country, which affords each region (especially the beaches) throughout the year.\nMargarita Island is one of the top tourist destinations for enjoyment and relaxation. It is an island with a modern infrastructure, bordered by beautiful beaches suitable for extreme sports, and features castles, fortresses and churches of great cultural value.\n\n\n=== Shortages ===\n\nShortages in Venezuela have been prevalent following the enactment of price controls and other policies during the economic policy of the Hugo Ch\u00e1vez government. Under the economic policy of the Nicol\u00e1s Maduro government, greater shortages occurred due to the Venezuelan government's policy of withholding United States dollars from importers with price controls.Shortages occur in regulated products, such as milk, various types of meat, coffee, rice, oil, flour, butter, and other goods including basic necessities like toilet paper, personal hygiene products, and even medicine. As a result of the shortages, Venezuelans must search for food, wait in lines for hours and sometimes settle without having certain products. Maduro's government has blamed the shortages on \"bourgeois criminals\" hoarding goods.A drought, combined with a lack of planning and maintenance, has caused a hydroelectricity shortage.  To deal with lack of power supply, in April 2016 the Maduro government announced rolling blackouts and reduced the government workweek to only Monday and Tuesday. A multi-university study found that, in 2016 alone, about 75% of Venezuelans lost weight due to hunger, with the average losing about 8.6 kg (19 lbs) due to the lack of food.By late-2016 and into 2017, Venezuelans had to search for food on a daily basis, occasionally resorting to eating wild fruit or garbage, wait in lines for hours and sometimes settle without having certain products. By early 2017, priests began telling Venezuelans to label their garbage so needy individuals could feed on their refuse. In March 2017, Venezuela, with the largest oil reserves in the world, began having shortages of gasoline in some regions with reports that fuel imports had begun.\n\n\n=== Petroleum and other resources ===\n\nVenezuela has the largest oil reserves, and the eighth largest natural gas reserves in the world. Compared to the preceding year another 40.4% in crude oil reserves were proven in 2010, allowing Venezuela to surpass Saudi Arabia as the country with the largest reserves of this type. The country's main petroleum deposits are located around and beneath Lake Maracaibo, the Gulf of Venezuela (both in Zulia), and in the Orinoco River basin (eastern Venezuela), where the country's largest reserve is located. Besides the largest conventional oil reserves and the second-largest natural gas reserves in the Western Hemisphere, Venezuela has non-conventional oil deposits (extra-heavy crude oil, bitumen and tar sands) approximately equal to the world's reserves of conventional oil. The electricity sector in Venezuela is one of the few to rely primarily on hydropower, and includes the Guri Dam, one of the largest in the world.\nIn the first half of the 20th century, U.S. oil companies were heavily involved in Venezuela, initially interested only in purchasing concessions. In 1943 a new government introduced a 50/50 split in profits between the government and the oil industry. In 1960, with a newly installed democratic government, Hydrocarbons Minister Juan Pablo P\u00e9rez Alfonso led the creation of OPEC, the consortium of oil-producing countries aiming to support the price of oil.In 1973, Venezuela voted to nationalize its oil industry outright, effective 1 January 1976, with Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA) taking over and presiding over a number of holding companies; in subsequent years, Venezuela built a vast refining and marketing system in the U.S. and Europe. In the 1990s PDVSA became more independent from the government and presided over an apertura (opening) in which it invited in foreign investment. Under Hugo Ch\u00e1vez a 2001 law placed limits on foreign investment.\nThe state oil company PDVSA played a key role in the December 2002 \u2013 February 2003 national strike which sought President Ch\u00e1vez' resignation. Managers and skilled highly paid technicians of PDVSA shut down the plants and left their posts, and by some reports sabotaged equipment, and petroleum production and refining by PDVSA almost ceased. Activities eventually were slowly restarted by returning and substitute oil workers. As a result of the strike, around 40% of the company's workforce (around 18,000 workers) were dismissed for \"dereliction of duty\" during the strike.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nVenezuela is connected to the world primarily via air (Venezuela's airports include the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar International Airport in Maiquet\u00eda, near Caracas and La Chinita International Airport near Maracaibo) and sea (with major sea ports at La Guaira, Maracaibo and Puerto Cabello). In the south and east the Amazon rainforest region has limited cross-border transport; in the west, there is a mountainous border of over 2,213 kilometres (1,375 mi) shared with Colombia. The Orinoco River is navigable by oceangoing vessels up to 400 kilometres (250 mi) inland, and connects the major industrial city of Ciudad Guayana to the Atlantic Ocean.\nVenezuela has a limited national railway system, which has no active rail connections to other countries. The government of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez tried to invest in expanding it, but Venezuela's rail project is on hold due to Venezuela not being able to pay the $7.5 billion and owing China Railway nearly $500 million.\nSeveral major cities have metro systems; the Caracas Metro has been operating since 1983. The Maracaibo Metro and Valencia Metro were opened more recently.\nVenezuela has a road network of nearly 100,000 kilometres (62,000 mi) in length, placing the country around 45th in the world; around a third of roads are paved.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nVenezuela is among the most urbanized countries in Latin America; the vast majority of Venezuelans live in the cities of the north, especially in the capital Caracas, which is also the largest city. About 93% of the population lives in urban areas in northern Venezuela; 73% live less than 100 kilometres (62 mi) from the coastline. Though almost half of Venezuela's land area lies south of the Orinoco, only 5% of Venezuelans live there. The largest and most important city south of the Orinoco is Ciudad Guayana, which is the sixth most populous conurbation. Other major cities include Barquisimeto, Valencia, Maracay, Maracaibo, Barcelona-Puerto La Cruz, M\u00e9rida and San Crist\u00f3bal.\nAccording to a 2014 study by sociologists of the Central University of Venezuela, over 1.5 million Venezuelans, or about 4% to 6% of the country's population, have left Venezuela since 1999 following the Bolivarian Revolution.\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\n\nThe people of Venezuela come from a variety of ancestries. It is estimated that the majority of the population is of mestizo, or mixed, ethnic ancestry.\nNevertheless, in the 2011 census, which Venezuelans were asked to identify themselves according to their customs and ancestry, the term mestizo was excluded from the answers. The majority claimed to be mestizo or white\u201451.6% and 43.6%, respectively. Practically half of the population claimed to be moreno, a term used throughout Ibero-America that in this case means \"dark-skinned\" or \"brown-skinned\", as opposed to having a lighter skin (this term connotes skin color or tone, rather than facial features or descent).\nEthnic minorities in Venezuela consist of groups that descend mainly from African or indigenous peoples; 2.8% identified themselves as \"black\" and 0.7% as afrodescendiente (Afro-descendant), 2.6% claimed to belong to indigenous peoples, and 1.2% answered \"other races\".Among indigenous people, 58% were Way\u00fau, 7% Warao, 5% Kari\u00f1a, 4% Pem\u00f3n, 3% Piaroa, 3% Jivi, 3% A\u00f1u, 3% Cuman\u00e1goto, 2% Yukpa, 2% Chaima and 1% Yanomami; the remaining 9% consisted of other indigenous nations.According to an autosomal DNA genetic study conducted in 2008 by the University of Bras\u00edlia (UNB), the composition of Venezuela's population is 60.60% of European contribution, 23% of indigenous contribution, and 16.30% of African contribution.\n\nDuring the colonial period and until after the Second World War, many of the European immigrants to Venezuela came from the Canary Islands, which had a significant cultural impact on the cuisine and customs of Venezuela. These influences on Venezuela have led to the nation being called the 8th island of the Canaries. With the start of oil exploitation in the early 20th century, companies from the United States began establishing operations in Venezuela, bringing with them U.S. citizens. Later, during and after the war, new waves of immigrants from other parts of Europe, the Middle East, and China began; many were encouraged by government-established immigration programs and lenient immigration policies. During the 20th century, Venezuela, along with the rest of Latin America, received millions of immigrants from Europe. This was especially true post-World War II, as a consequence of war-ridden Europe. During the 1970s, while experiencing an oil-export boom, Venezuela received millions of immigrants from Ecuador, Colombia, and the Dominican Republic. Due to the belief that this immigration influx depressed wages, some Venezuelans opposed European immigration. The Venezuelan government, however, were actively recruiting immigrants from Eastern Europe to fill a need for engineers. Millions of Colombians, as well as Middle Eastern and Haitian populations would continue immigrating to Venezuela into the early 21st century.According to the World Refugee Survey 2008, published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, Venezuela hosted a population of refugee and asylum seekers from Colombia numbering 252,200 in 2007, and 10,600 new asylum seekers entered Venezuela in 2007. Between 500,000 and one million illegal immigrants are estimated to be living in the country.The total indigenous population of the country is estimated at about 500 thousand people (2.8% of the total), distributed among 40 indigenous peoples. There are three uncontacted tribes living in Venezuela. The Constitution recognizes the multi-ethnic, pluri-cultural, and multilingual character of the country and includes a chapter devoted to indigenous peoples' rights, which opened up spaces for their political inclusion at national and local level in 1999.\nMost indigenous peoples are concentrated in eight states along Venezuela's borders with Brazil, Guyana, and Colombia, and the majority groups are the Wayuu (west), the Warao (east), the Yanomami (south), and the Pemon (southeast).\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nAlthough most residents are monolingual Spanish speakers, many languages are spoken in Venezuela. In addition to Spanish, the Constitution recognizes more than thirty indigenous languages, including Wayuu, Warao, Pem\u00f3n, and many others for the official use of the indigenous peoples, mostly with few speakers \u2013 less than 1% of the total population. Wayuu is the most spoken indigenous language with 170,000 speakers.Immigrants, in addition to Spanish, speak their own languages. Chinese (400,000), Portuguese (254,000), and Italian (200,000) are the most spoken languages in Venezuela after the official language of Spanish. Arabic is spoken by Lebanese and Syrian colonies on Isla de Margarita, Maracaibo, Punto Fijo, Puerto la Cruz, El Tigre, Maracay, and Caracas. Portuguese is spoken not only by the Portuguese community in Santa Elena de Uair\u00e9n but also by much of the population due to its proximity to Brazil. The German community speaks their native language, while the people of Colonia Tovar speak mostly an Alemannic dialect of German called alem\u00e1n coloniero.\nEnglish is the most widely used foreign language in demand and is spoken by many professionals, academics, and members of the upper and middle classes as a result of the oil exploration done by foreign companies, in addition to its acceptance as a lingua franca. Culturally, English is common in southern towns like El Callao, and the native English-speaking influence is evident in folk and calypso songs from the region. English was brought to Venezuela by Trinidadian and other British West Indies immigrants. A variety of Antillean Creole is spoken by a small community in El Callao and Paria. Italian language teaching is guaranteed by the presence of a consistent number of private Venezuelan schools and institutions, where Italian language courses and Italian literature are active. Other languages spoken by large communities in the country are Basque and Galician, among others.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nAccording to a 2011 poll (GIS XXI), 88% of the population is Christian, primarily Roman Catholic (71%), and the remaining 17% Protestant, primarily Evangelicals (in Latin America Protestants are usually called \"evangelicos\"). 8% of Venezuelans are irreligious (atheist 2% and agnostic and 6% indifferent). Almost 3% of the population follow another religion (1% of these people practice Santer\u00eda).There are small but influential Muslim, Buddhist, and Jewish communities. The Muslim community of more than 100,000 is concentrated among persons of Lebanese and Syrian descent living in Nueva Esparta State, Punto Fijo and the Caracas area. Buddhism in Venezuela is practiced by over 52,000 people. The Buddhist community is made up mainly of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean people. There are Buddhist centers in Caracas, Maracay, M\u00e9rida, Puerto Ord\u00e1z, San Felipe, and Valencia.\nThe Jewish community has shrunk in recent years due to rising antisemitism in Venezuela, with the population declining from 22,000 in 1999 to less than 7,000 in 2015.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe culture of Venezuela is a melting pot made up of three main groups: The Indigenous Venezuelans, the Africans, and the Spanish. The first two cultures were in turn differentiated according to their tribes. Acculturation and assimilation, typical of a cultural syncretism, led to the Venezuelan culture of the present day, which is similar in many ways to the culture of the rest of Latin America, but still has its own unique characteristics.\nThe indigenous and African influence is limited to a few words, food names, and place names. However, the Africans also brought in many musical influences, especially introduction of the drum. The Spanish influence predominantes due to the colonization process and the socioeconomic structure it created, and in particular came from the regions of Andalusia and Extremadura (the places of origin of most of the settlers in the Caribbean during the colonial era). Spanish influences can be seen in the country's architecture, music, religion, and language.\n\nSpanish influences can also be seen in the bullfights that take place in Venezuela, and in certain gastronomical features. Venezuela was also enriched by immigration streams of Indian and European origin in the 19th century, especially from France. Most recently, immigration from the United States, Spain, Italy, and Portugal has further enriched the already complex cultural mosaic (especially in large oil-producing cities).\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nCarlos Ra\u00fal Villanueva was the most important Venezuelan architect of the modern era; he designed the Central University of Venezuela, (a World Heritage Site) and its Aula Magna. Other notable architectural works include the Capitolio, the Baralt Theatre, the Teresa Carre\u00f1o Cultural Complex, and the General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nVenezuelan art was initially dominated by religious motifs. However, in the late 19th century, artists began emphasizing historical and heroic representations of the country's struggle for independence. This move was led by Mart\u00edn Tovar y Tovar. Modernism took over in the 20th century. Notable Venezuelan artists include Arturo Michelena, Crist\u00f3bal Rojas, Armando Rever\u00f3n, Manuel Cabr\u00e9; the kinetic artists Jes\u00fas Soto, Gego and Carlos Cruz-Diez; and contemporary artists such as Marisol and Yucef Merhi.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nVenezuelan literature originated soon after the Spanish conquest of the mostly pre-literate indigenous societies. It was originally dominated by Spanish influences.  Following the rise of political literature during the Venezuelan War of Independence, Venezuelan Romanticism, notably expounded by Juan Vicente Gonz\u00e1lez, emerged as the first important genre in the region. Although mainly focused on narrative writing, Venezuelan literature was advanced by poets such as Andr\u00e9s Eloy Blanco and Ferm\u00edn Toro.\nMajor writers and novelists include R\u00f3mulo Gallegos, Teresa de la Parra, Arturo Uslar Pietri, Adriano Gonz\u00e1lez Le\u00f3n, Miguel Otero Silva, and Mariano Pic\u00f3n Salas. The great poet and humanist Andr\u00e9s Bello was also an educator and intellectual (He was also a childhood tutor and mentor of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar). Others, such as Laureano Vallenilla Lanz and Jos\u00e9 Gil Fortoul, contributed to Venezuelan Positivism.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nThe indigenous musical styles of Venezuela are exemplified by groups like Un S\u00f3lo Pueblo and Serenata Guayanesa. The national musical instrument is the cuatro. Traditional musical styles and songs mainly emerged in and around the llanos region, including, \"Alma llanera\" (by Pedro El\u00edas Guti\u00e9rrez and Rafael Bol\u00edvar Coronado), \"Florentino y el diablo\" (by Alberto Arvelo Torrealba), \"Concierto en la llanura\" by Juan Vicente Torrealba, and \"Caballo viejo\" (by Sim\u00f3n D\u00edaz).\nThe Zulian gaita is also a very popular genre, generally performed during Christmas. The national dance is the joropo. Venezuela has always been a melting pot of cultures and this can be seen in the richness and variety of its musical styles and dances: calipso, bambuco, ful\u00eda, cantos de pilado de ma\u00edz, cantos de lavanderas, sebuc\u00e1n, and maremare. Teresa Carre\u00f1o was a world-famous 19th century piano virtuoso. Recently, great classical music performances have come out of Venezuela. The Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Youth Orchestra, under the leadership of its principal conductor Gustavo Dudamel and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Abreu, has hosted a number of excellent concerts in many European concert halls, most notably at the 2007 London Proms, and has received several honors. The orchestra is the pinnacle of El Sistema, a publicly financed, voluntary music education program now being emulated in other countries.\nIn the early 21st century, a movement known as \"Movida Ac\u00fastica Urbana\" featured musicians trying to save some national traditions, creating their own original songs but using traditional instruments. Some groups following this movement are Tambor Urbano, Los Sinverguenzas, C4Tr\u00edo, and Orozco Jam.Afro-Venezuelan musical traditions are most intimately related to the festivals of the \"black folk saints\" San Juan and St. Benedict the Moor. Specific songs are related to the different stages of their festivals and processions, when the saints start their yearly \"paseo\" \u2013 stroll \u2013 through the community to dance with their people.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nThe origins of baseball in Venezuela are unclear, although it is known that the sport was being played in the country by the late 19th century. In the early 20th century, North American immigrants who came to Venezuela to work in the nation's oil industry helped to popularize the sport in Venezuela. During the 1930s, baseball's popularity continued to rise in the country, leading to the foundation of the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League (LVBP) in 1945, and the sport would soon become the nation's most popular.The immense popularity of baseball in the country makes Venezuela a rarity among its South American neighbors\u2014association football is the dominant sport in the continent. However, football, as well as basketball, are among the more popular sports played in Venezuela. Venezuela hosted the 2012 Basketball World Olympic Qualifying Tournament and the 2013 FIBA Basketball Americas Championship, which took place in the Poliedro de Caracas.\n\nAlthough not as popular in Venezuela as the rest of South America, football, spearheaded by the Venezuela national football team is gaining popularity as well. The sport is also noted for having an increased focus during the World Cup. According to the CONMEBOL alphabetical rotation policy established in 2011, Venezuela is scheduled to host the Copa Am\u00e9rica every 40 years.Venezuela is also home to former Formula 1 driver, Pastor Maldonado. At the 2012 Spanish Grand Prix, he claimed his first pole and victory, and became the first and only Venezuelan to have done so in Formula 1 history. Maldonado has increased the reception of Formula 1 in Venezuela, helping to popularize the sport in the country.In the 2012 Summer Olympics, Venezuelan Rub\u00e9n Limardo won a gold medal in fencing.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nThe Venezuelan cuisine reflects the climatic contrasts and cultures that coexist in Venezuela. Among Venezuela's dishes are the hallaca, pabell\u00f3n criollo, arepas, empanadas, pisca andina, tarkar\u00ed de chivo, jalea de mango, patacones, and fried camiguanas.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe literacy rate of the adult population was already at 91.1% by 1998. In 2008, 95.2% of the adult population was literate. The net primary school enrollment rate was at 91% and the net secondary school enrollment rate was at 63% in 2005. Venezuela has a number of universities, of which the most prestigious are the Central University of Venezuela (UCV) founded in Caracas in 1721, the University of Zulia (LUZ) founded in 1891, the University of the Andes (ULA) founded in M\u00e9rida State in 1810, the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar University (USB) founded in Miranda State in 1967, and the University of the East (UDO) founded in Sucre State in 1958.\n\nCurrently, many Venezuelan graduates seek a future abroad because of the country's troubled economy and heavy crime rate. In a study titled \"Venezolana Community Abroad: A New Method of Exile\" by Thomas P\u00e1ez, Mercedes Vivas, and Juan Rafael Pulido of the Central University of Venezuela, over 1.35 million Venezuelan college graduates have left the country since the beginning of the Bolivarian Revolution. It is believed that nearly 12% of Venezuelans live abroad, with Ireland becoming a popular destination for students. According to Claudio Bifano, president of the Venezuelan Academy of Physical, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences, more than half of all medical graduates had left Venezuela in 2013.By 2018, over half of all Venezuelan children had dropped out of school, with 58% of students quitting nationwide while areas near bordering countries saw more than 80% of their students leave. Nationwide, about 93% of schools do not meet the minimum requirements to operate and 77% do not have utilities such as food, water or electricity.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nVenezuela has a national universal health care system. The current government has created a program to expand access to health care known as Misi\u00f3n Barrio Adentro, although its efficiency and work conditions have been criticized. It has been reported that many Misi\u00f3n Barrio Adentro clinics have been closed, and (as of December 2014) it is estimated that 80% of Barrio Adentro establishments in Venezuela are abandoned.Infant mortality in Venezuela was 19 deaths per 1,000 births for 2014 which was lower than the South American average (To compare: The U.S. figure was 6 deaths per 1,000 births in 2013 and the Canadian figure was 4.5 deaths per 1,000 live births). Child malnutrition (defined as stunting or wasting in children under the age of five) was 17%. Delta Amacuro and Amazonas had the nation's highest rates. According to the United Nations, 32% of Venezuelans lacked adequate sanitation, primarily those living in rural areas. Diseases ranging from diphtheria, plague, malaria, typhoid fever, yellow fever, cholera, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis D were present in the country. Obesity was prevalent in approximately 30% of the adult population in Venezuela.Venezuela had a total of 150 sewage treatment plants; however, 13% of the population lacked access to drinking water, but this number had been dropping.During the economic crisis observed under President Maduro's presidency, medical professionals were forced to perform outdated treatments on patients.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nIndex of Venezuela-related articles\nOutline of Venezuela\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nArticles\n\nBooks\n\nTalks and interviews\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nLast archived iteration of official government website, which appears to be down (in Spanish)\nChief of State and Cabinet Members\n\"Venezuela\".

        "wiki": "Parque del Este (\"East Park\"), officially Generalissimo Francisco de Miranda Park, in honor of the Venezuelan national hero, is a public recreation park located in the Sucre Municipality of Metropolitan Caracas in Venezuela. Opened in 1961, it is one of the most important of the city, with an area of 82 hectares (200 acres). The park was designed by Roberto Burle Marx and associates Fernando Tabora and John Stoddart.The park is located just outside the station Miranda (formerly East Park) Line 1 of the Caracas Metro. East Park is managed and supervised by the National Parks Institute (INPARQUES), an agency under the Ministry of Popular Power for the Environment.\nThe park combines three differently designed areas: the first is an open grass field with a gentle undulating topography, the second is a densely forested landscape with meandering pathways, while the third is a series of paved gardens with tiled murals and water works.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe park is located on part of the land of the ancient hacienda San Jose. (10 \u00b0 29'38 \"N - 66 \u00b0 50'8\" W) The hacienda still exists and is located between the existing park boundaries and the distributor Santa Cecilia, in front of the Caracas Museum of Transport. \nThe area was covered with forest vegetation composed primarily of old Bucares (Erythrina spp.) on which hung strands of Lagas Palo Beard (Tillandsia usneoides); in addition there were old coffee trees (Coffea arabica).\nThe park's inauguration took place under the government of President Romulo Betancourt on January 19, 1961 under the Decree No. 443 May 1960 and was designed by Brazilian landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx and associates Fernando Tabora and John Stoddart.When first opened the park was designed to receive about 6,000 visitors per month; in 2008 the park received 270,000 visitors a month.\n\n\n=== Official name ===\nPark East over its history has had the following official names. At the time of its inauguration in 1961 was called Park \"Romulo Gallegos\" and in 1983 was renamed Park \"Romulo Betancourt\" a memorial to that character until 2002, when its name changed to present name Park Generalissimo \"Francisco Miranda\" in honor of the Venezuelan national hero.\n\n\n=== Humboldt Planetarium ===\nHumboldt Planetarium started construction on 15 January 1959 under the direction of its designer the Venezuelan architect Carlos Guinand Sandoz (1917 - 1963) his inauguration took place on July 24, 1961, its facilities include a 20-meter dome and a Zeiss planetarium projector.\nIts mission is to establish the knowledge in astronomy and related sciences, and to make them available for all public. The planetarium wants to promote formal education in all scientific levels. \n\n\n=== Zoo ===\nThe park has a zoo with a wide variety of animals including jaguars, monkeys, squirrels, capybaras, ocelots, sloths, opossums, many kinds of birds: Caricare, many types of parrot, yellow-shouldered parrot, Tinamou, White heron, kind egret, Blue heron, gonzalito, blue and yellow macaw, scarlet macaw, Green macaw, North Guacharaca, Barn owls, helmeted curassow, king Zamuro (vulture), Red-billed toucan and reptiles including crocodiles and anacondas.\n\n\n=== Caravel of Christopher Columbus ===\nFor many years one of the attractions of the Parque del Este was the caravel of Columbus, a replica of the ship known as the Nao Santa Maria  was built in the city of Barcelona, Spain, and was purchased by the Corporacion Venezolana Development and brought to the country in 1967. The Children's Foundation donated it to the Parque del Este on 12 October 1971; inside there were allegorical figures of Columbus and the crew that accompanied him on his travels, as well as weapons, shields, flags, clothing, tools, navigational devices and more.\n\n\n=== Corvette Leander ===\nThe Nao Santa Maria operated until 2008 when by decree of the National Executive President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez was dismantled to make way for a replica of the cruiser Leander and a museum in honor of Francisco de Miranda project which has brought inclusive of a legal dispute.Considerations aside, the Nao Santa Maria suffered damage caused by years of government neglect, so the replication status at the time of decommissioning was serious. One of the reasons which led to their change by the corvette was the need to implement the rehabilitation plan of the park that had been created to receive about 6,00 people a month, but already was welcoming about 270,000, with consequent damage as a result.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAnita Berrizbeitia: Roberto Burle-Marx in Caracas.

        "wiki": "Maracaibo (; Spanish pronunciation: [ma\u027ea\u02c8kaj\u03b2o] (listen); Wayuu: Marakaaya) is a city and the municipal seat of Maracaibo Municipality in northwestern Venezuela, on the western shore of the strait that connects Lake Maracaibo to the Gulf of Venezuela. It is the second-largest city in Venezuela, after the national capital, Caracas, and the capital of the state of Zulia. The population of the city is approximately 2,658,355 with the metropolitan area estimated at 5,278,448 as of 2010.\nMaracaibo is nicknamed \"The Beloved Land of the Sun\" (Spanish: \"La Tierra del Sol Amada\"). \nMaracaibo is considered the economic center of the western part of Venezuela, owing to the petroleum industry that developed in the shores of Lake Maracaibo. It is sometimes known as \"The First City of Venezuela\", for being the first city in Venezuela to adopt various types of public services, including electricity, as well as for being located adjacent to shores of Lake Maracaibo, where the name of Venezuela allegedly originates.Early indigenous settlements around the area were of Arawak and Carib origin. Maracaibo\u2019s founding date is disputed. There were failed attempts to found the city\u2014in 1529, by Captain Ambrosio Ehinger, and in 1569, by Captain Alonso Pacheco. Founded in 1574 as Nueva Zamora de la Laguna de Maracaibo by Captain Captain Pedro Maldonado, the city became a transshipment point for inland settlements after Gibraltar, at the head of the lake, had been destroyed by pirates in 1669. It was not until the first decades of the 17th century that the first town was settled. Petroleum was discovered in 1917, leading to a large increase in population from migration.\nMaracaibo is served by La Chinita International Airport. The General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge connects Maracaibo with the rest of the country. The La Chiquinquir\u00e1 Church catholic church within the city.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name Maracaibo is said to come from the brave cacique (Indian chief) Mara, a young native who valiantly resisted the Spaniards and died fighting them. Legend says that when Mara fell, the Indians shouted \"Mara kay\u00f3!\" (Mara fell!), thus originating the city name --although it would be strange for them to shout in Spanish. Other historians say that the first name of this land in the local language was \"Maara-iwo\" meaning \"Place where serpents abound\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nThe first indigenous settlements were of Arawak and Carib origin. Around the main group were the A\u00f1u tribe who built rows of stilt houses all over the northern riviera of the Lake Maracaibo. The first Europeans arrived in 1499.\nThe city was founded three times: the first time was during the Klein-Venedig period (1528\u20131546), when the Welser bankers of Augsburg received a concession over Venezuela Province from Charles I. of Spain. In August 1529, the German Ambrosius Ehinger made his first expedition to Lake Maracaibo, which was bitterly opposed by the indigenous Coquivacoa. After winning a series of bloody battles, he founded the settlement on 8 September 1529. Ehinger named the settlement New Nuremberg (German: Neu-N\u00fcrnberg) and the lake after the valiant chieftain Mara of the Coquivacoa, who had died in the fighting. The city was renamed Maracaibo after the Spanish took possession. The lack of activity in the zone made Nikolaus Federmann evacuate the village in 1535 and move its population to Santa Marta near the then capital of Venezuela Province, Santa Ana de Coro.\nA second attempt by Captain Alonso Pacheco in 1569 suffered a brief setback when the city had to be evacuated in 1573 due to ferocious attacks by native local tribes. The European settlement returned a short while later, in 1574, however, for which it was re-founded by Captain Pedro Maldonado under Governor Diego de Mazariegos' command and assuming the name of Nueva Zamora de Maracaibo. \"Nueva Zamora\" comes from Mazariego's place of birth, Zamora, in Spain. Since its definite foundation, the town began to develop as a whole. It is based on the western side of Lake Maracaibo, the dominant feature of the oil-rich Maracaibo Basin. Favored by prevailing winds and a protected harbour, the city is located on the shores of the lake where the narrows, which eventually lead to the Gulf of Venezuela, first become pronounced.\n\n\n=== Pirates' attacks ===\nThe Dutch corsair Henrik de Gerard plundered Maracaibo in 1614, and in 1642 the city was attacked by the British pirate William Jackson. In 1667, l'Olonnais with a fleet of eight ships and a crew of six hundred pirates sacked Maracaibo and Gibraltar. En route, l'Olonnais crossed paths with a Spanish treasure ship, which he captured, along with its rich cargo of cacao, gemstones and more than 260,000 pieces of eight.\nIn March 1669, Henry Morgan sacked Maracaibo, which emptied when his fleet was first spied, and moved on to the Spanish settlement of Gibraltar on the inside of Lake Maracaibo in search of more treasure. A few weeks later, when he attempted to sail out of the lake, Morgan found an occupied fort blocking the inlet to the Caribbean, along with three Spanish ships. These were the Magdalena, the San Luis, and the Soledad. He destroyed the Magdalena and burned the San Luis by sending a dummy ship full of gunpowder to explode near them, after which the crew of the Soledad surrendered. By faking a landward attack on the fort, thereby convincing the Spanish governor to shift his cannon, he eluded their guns and escaped.In June 1678, Michel de Grammont French commander of six ships and 700 men captured Maracaibo then followed the plundering of several smaller towns as Gibraltar, penetrating as far inland as Trujillo.\n\n\n=== Venezuelan independence ===\nIn 1810, the province of Maracaibo did not join the First Republic of Venezuela and remained loyal to the Spanish crown. Maracaibo then held the seat of the Captaincy General of Venezuela.\nIn 1821, uprisings in favor of independence began to lead to warfare and hostility. The royalists, led by Francisco Tom\u00e1s Morales, fought with the patriots, led by Rafael Urdaneta, to take back control over the province in the Juana de \u00c1vila Battle, and Morales brought back Spanish rule in 1822 until he was defeated at the Battle of Lake Maracaibo on 24 July 1823, culminating Venezuela's struggle for independence.\n\n\n=== Isolation period ===\nFor about 390 years, Maracaibo remained isolated and separated from the rest of the country. Transportation was only possible across the lake by ferry or other marine transport.\nCars, buses, and lorries, with their constant flow of manufactured goods and agricultural product, depended on the ferry system between the city and the eastern shore with their roads to connect to the country's motorway system. Maracaibo and the Lake Maracaibo region's economy was more linked to Colombia than to eastern Venezuela due to the natural route available through Lake Maracaibo then leading to the sea.\nThis isolation was both a challenge and an advantage. The very nature of the city's location made for a population known for their independent thought and character. The history of this region is rife with stories about the creation of an independent and sovereign nation apart from Venezuela, a nation called La Rep\u00fablica Independiente del Zulia, which means The Independent Republic of Zulia, but this has never come to be.\nIn January 1903, as the naval blockade of Venezuela continued during the negotiations with presidente Cipriano Castro, the German warship SMS Panther attempted to enter Lake Maracaibo, which was a center of German commercial activity. On 17 January, it exchanged fire with the settlement of Fort San Carlos, but withdrew after half an hour, as shallow waters prevented it getting close enough to the fort to be effective. The Venezuelans claimed this as a victory, and in response the German commander sent the SMS Vineta, with heavier weapons, to set an example. On 21 January, the SMS Vineta bombarded the fort, setting fire to it and destroying it, with the death of 25 civilians in the nearby town.\nIn 1908, the Friesland, Gelderland and Jacob van Heemskerck\nwere sent to patrol the Venezuelan coast during the second Castro crisis. Friesland guarded the entry way to Maracaibo.\n\n\n=== Building of the bridge ===\n\nThe dictatorial regime of General Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez in the 1950s set as a goal the construction of a bridge connecting the two lake shores. Various bridge projects for the spanning of the Lake Maracaibo narrows near the city were in the works. The general's government had decided that this \"city of independent thought\" should be more \"connected\" to the rest of the country.\nProposals for a bridge design that included rail transport and tourist facilities were seriously considered. The fall of the P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez government on 23 January 1958, quickly led to a less elaborate design project that was approved and funded by a democratic and more conservative government.\nThe building of \"El Puente Sobre El Lago de Maracaibo \"General Rafael Urdaneta\"\u2014(General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge over Lake Maracaibo) named after the distinguished General hero of the War of Independence was opened to public traffic in 1962. The project was completed on schedule in 40 months.\nThis bridge construction project was a remarkable feat. Built under very difficult conditions, when completed, it became the longest prestressed concrete bridge in the world. The structure is in constant use and remains today as the most important link between Maracaibo, along with much of the state of Zulia, and the rest of Venezuela.\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\nMaracaibo has become a large metropolitan city, comprising two municipalities: to the north the municipality of Maracaibo and to the south the San Francisco municipality (established in 1995). In recent years, due to political/economic and cultural reasons, many have moved to Maracaibo from rural areas and other cities (including Caracas).\n\nIn the political arena, the citizens of Maracaibo (and most other cities and municipalities in Zulia state) have in recent years voted for a competitive political system in where the governor is from a certain political party and the mayor or mayors are from the opposite political party.\nMaracaibo also boasts one of the best universities in the country, the state university. La Universidad del Zulia (LUZ) is well renowned for its excellent law, medical and engineering schools as many other disciplines. Other universities and schools include Universidad Dr. Rafael Belloso Chac\u00edn (URBE) and Universidad Rafael Urdaneta, with one of the country's leading psychology schools.\nThe Diocese of Maracaibo (23 July 1965) was elevated to Archdiocese on 30 April 1966 by Pope Paulus VI. Maracaibo was visited by Pope John Paul II in 1985. Since November 2000, its Archbishop has been Ubaldo Ram\u00f3n Santana Sequera.\n\n\n==== Perspective ====\n\nFran\u00e7ois de Pons, an agent to the French government in Caracas, provides some historical insight into the people of Maracaibo in his travel journal (de Pons 1806). The following excerpts describe the local population of Maracaibo:\n\nThey perform coasting, or long voyages, with equal facility; and when all trade is suspended by the operations of war, they enter privateers. Bred up in the neighbourhood of the lake, they are mostly all expert swimmers and excellent divers. Their reputation stands equally high as soldiers. Those who do not enter into the sea service, form plantations, or assist in cultivating those that belong to their fathers. Nothing proves better their aptitude for this kind of occupation, than the immense flocks of cattle with which the savannas of Maracaybo  [sic] are covered.He also notes the appreciation of literature, the arts, education, and culture among the people of Maracaibo:\n\nBut what confers the greatest honour on the inhabitants of Maracaibo, is their application to literature; in which, notwithstanding the wretched state of public education, they make considerable progress....They likewise acquired the art of elocution, and of writing their mother tongue with the greatest purity; in a word, they possessed all the qualities that characterise men of letters.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nZulia\u00b4s main income comes from oil extraction and refining, agriculture (coffee, rice, maize, cassava, cocoa, sugar cane),\nlivestock production, and mining (clay, limestone, coal and sand).\n\n\n=== Medicine ===\nHuntington's disease prevalence worldwide is 5\u201310 cases per 100,000 persons. One of the highest incidences is in the isolated populations of the Lake Maracaibo region of Venezuela, where HD affects up to 700 per 100,000 persons.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nThe Maracaibo Municipality is currently divided into 18 parishes, which are\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMaracaibo is one of the hottest cities of Venezuela and all of South America as well. The rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta gives the city a semiarid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSh) attenuated only by the moderating influence of the lake; Maracaibo\u2019s average historical temperature is 29 \u00b0C (84.2 \u00b0F). In the past, the climate of the city, indeed all along the coast of Lake Maracaibo, was unhealthy due to the combination of high temperatures with high humidity. Today, control of plagues and the effects of urban development has largely eradicated these health problems. The registered high temperature of the city is 41 \u00b0C (105.8 \u00b0F), and the lowest is 18 \u00b0C (64.4 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\nSeveral universities are based in the city:\n\nUniversidad del Zulia - (LUZ)\nUniversidad Nacional Experimental de la Fuerza Armada UNEFA\nUniversidad Rafael Belloso Chac\u00edn - (URBE)\nUniversidad Rafael Urdaneta\nUniversidad Cat\u00f3lica Cecilio Acosta\nUniversidad Dr. Jos\u00e9 Gregorio Hern\u00e1ndez\nUniversidad Bolivariano de Venezuela sede Zulia\nUniversidad Nacional Abierta (UNA) Centro Local Zulia\n\n\n=== International schools ===\nEscuela Bella Vista (American school)\nColegio Alem\u00e1n de Maracaibo, formerly Colegio Alem\u00e1n del Zulia (German school)\n\n\n== Sports ==\nDue to the regionalistic nature of Marabinos, they strongly support their native teams. Maracaibo, and the rest of Zulia, are represented in baseball by the \u00c1guilas del Zulia, a Venezuelan winter league team that plays in the Liga Venezolana de B\u00e9isbol Profesional, and is based in the Estadio Luis Aparicio El Grande. The city's basketball team is Gaiteros del Zulia, which plays in the Liga Profesional de Baloncesto de Venezuela. Its home is the 5.000-people Pedro El\u00edas Belisario Aponte stadium. Other teams include the Uni\u00f3n Atl\u00e9tico Maracaibo and the Zulia FC in football, the Maracaibo Rugby Football Club and the Zulianos Rugby Club.\nIn the 2000 Little League World Series, the Sierrra Maestra Little League of Maracaibo, Venezuela defeated Bellaire Little League of Bellaire, Texas in the championship game of the 54th Little League World Series. The Coquivocoa Little League team from Maracaibo placed third in the 1974 Little League World Series.\nRugby in Venezuela was first played in Maracaibo, thanks to the influence of the English community based on the Zulia State\nTeam:\n\nBaseball: \u00c1guilas del Zulia BBC.\nBasketball: Gaiteros del Zulia\nSoccer: Uni\u00f3n Atl\u00e9tico Maracaibo, Zulia FC\nRugby: Maracaibo Rugby Football Club \"Oil Blacks\", Zulianos Rugby Club\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCulture in Maracaibo is very indigenous and unique, is recognized in every state and city in Venezuela, and is very influential with its gaitas, desserts, style, living, and customs. Most major houses of advertising in Venezuela acknowledge how opposite the culture of Maracaibo is from that of Caracas. Studies of both prove, for example, that Caracas' leading soft drink brand is Coke, while in Maracaibo it is Pepsi. This has made many brands create special localized advertising of their products (including several Pepsi commercials spoken by local celebrities).\nMarabinos are extremely proud of their city, their culture, and all of Zulia. They usually claim that Venezuela wouldn't be the country it actually is without Zulia. Rivalry with inhabitants of other regions is common, specially with Gochos (people of the Trujillo, M\u00e9rida and T\u00e1chira state) and Caraque\u00f1os (people of the city of Caracas).\nThe Gaita is a style of Venezuelan folk music from Maracaibo. According to Joan Corominas, it may come from gaits, the Gothic word for \"goat\", which is the skin generally used for the membrane of the furro instrument. Other instruments used in gaita include maracas, cuatro, charrasca and tambora (Venezuelan drum). Song themes range from humorous and love songs to protest songs.The style became popular throughout Venezuela in the 1960s, and it fused with other styles such as salsa and merengue in the 1970s. Famous gaita groups include Maracaibo 15, Gran Coquivacoa, Barrio Obrero, Cardenales del \u00c9xito, Koquimba, Melody Gaita, Guaco, Estrellas del Zulia, Saladillo, and many others.\n\n\n=== Museums, cultural centers and theaters ===\n\nMuseo de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo del estado Zulia (MACZUL)\nMuseo General Rafael Urdaneta\nMuseo Municipal de Artes Gr\u00e1ficas \"Balmiro Le\u00f3n\"\nCentro de Bellas Artes de Maracaibo\nCentro de Arte de Maracaibo \"L\u00eda Berm\u00fadez\"\nTeatro Baralt\nMuseo de la Gaita\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\nBiblioteca Publica del Zulia\nBiblioteca P\u00fablica \"Arturo Uslar Pietri\"\nBiblioteca \"Dr. Pedro Alciro Barboza de la Torre\"\nBiblioteca P\u00fablica \"Sim\u00f3n Palmar\"\nBiblioteca P\u00fablica \"Lu\u00eds Guillermo Pineda Belloso\" (De car\u00e1cter p\u00fablico, biling\u00fce y circulante)\nBiblioteca P\u00fablica Especializada \"Pedag\u00f3gica\"\nBiblioteca P\u00fablica Especializada \"SEDINI\"\nBiblioteca Privada \"Dr. Nectario Andrade Labarca\"\n\n\n== Notable natives ==\nBetty Cecilia Lugo - Philanthropist\nTeolindo Acosta - baseball player\nGustavo Aguado - musician, singer and leader of Guaco, Venezuela's most influential music band\nRicardo Aguirre - composer and singer\nDaniel Alvarado - singer and actor\nWilson \u00c1lvarez - Major League Baseball left-handed pitcher\nErnesto Aparicio - Major League Baseball baseball player, manager, and team owner\nLuis Aparicio - former shortstop in Major League Baseball and member of the Baseball Hall of Fame\nPedro Aranguren- militar\nEduardo Arcila Far\u00edas - journalist and historian\nRafael Maria Baralt - diplomat, writer, philologist, historian, first Latin American to occupy a chair at the 'Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola'\nHuascar Barradas - flutist\nRafael Belloso Chac\u00edn - physician\nLuis Barrera Linares - writer, academic, teacher of Universidad Simon Bolivar\nJos\u00e9 Bracho - baseball pitcher\nAntonio Bri\u00f1ez - first manager to win a National Amateur Baseball championship to Venezuela\nMar\u00eda Calca\u00f1o - poet\nJos\u00e9 Antonio Casanova - baseball player and manager of the Venezuelan team that won the gold medal in 1959 Panamerican Games\nAbel Castellano Jr. - jockey\nJavier Castellano- jockey Eclipse Award 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016.

        "wiki": "Caracas (, Spanish: [ka\u02c8\u027eakas]), officially Santiago de Le\u00f3n de Caracas, abbreviated as CCS, is the capital and largest city of Venezuela, and the center of the Metropolitan Region of Caracas (or Greater Caracas). Caracas is located along the Guaire River in the northern part of the country, within the Caracas Valley of the Venezuelan coastal mountain range (Cordillera de la Costa). The valley is close to the Caribbean Sea, separated from the coast by a steep 2,200-metre-high (7,200 ft) mountain range, Cerro El \u00c1vila; to the south there are more hills and mountains. The Metropolitan Region of Caracas has an estimated population of almost 5 million inhabitants.\nThe center of the city is still Catedral, located near Bol\u00edvar Square, though some consider the center to be Plaza Venezuela, located in the Los Caobos area. Businesses in the city include service companies, banks, and malls. Caracas has a largely service-based economy, apart from some industrial activity in its metropolitan area. The Caracas Stock Exchange and Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA) are headquartered in Caracas. PDVSA is the largest company in Venezuela. Caracas is also Venezuela's cultural capital, with many restaurants, theaters, museums, and shopping centers. Caracas has some of the tallest skyscrapers in Latin America, such as the Parque Central Towers. The Museum of Contemporary Art of Caracas is one of the most important in South America.Caracas has one of the highest per capita murder rates in the world, with 111.19 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBefore the city was founded in 1567, the valley of Caracas was populated by indigenous peoples. Francisco Fajardo, the son of a Spanish captain and a Guaiqueri cacica, who came from Margarita, began establishing settlements in the area of La Guaira and the Caracas valley between 1555 and 1560. Fajardo attempted to establish a plantation in the valley in 1562 after these unsuccessful coastal towns, but it did not last long: it was destroyed by natives of the region led by Terepaima and Guaicaipuro. Fajardo's 1560 settlement was known as Hato de San Francisco, and another attempt in 1561 by Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Su\u00e1rez was called Villa de San Francisco, and was also destroyed by the same native people. The eventual settlers of Caracas came from Coro, the German capital of their Klein-Venedig colony around the present-day coastal Colombia\u2013Venezuela border; from the 1540s, the colony had been de facto controlled by Spaniards. Moving eastward from Coro, groups of Spanish settlers founded inland towns including Barquisimeto and Valencia before reaching the Caracas valley.On 25 July 1567, Captain Diego de Losada laid the foundations of the city of Santiago de Le\u00f3n de Caracas. De Losada had been commissioned to capture the valley, and was successful by splitting the natives into different groups to work with, then fighting and defeating each of them. The town was the closest to the coast of these new settlements, and the colonists retained a native workforce, which allowed a trade network to develop between Caracas, the interior, and Margarita; the towns further inland produced ample cotton products and beeswax, and Margarita was a rich source of pearls. The Caracas valley had a good environment for both agricultural and arable farming, which contributed to the system of commerce but meant that the town's population was initially sparse, as it was only large enough to support a few farms.In 1577, Caracas became the capital of the Spanish Empire's Venezuela Province under the province's new governor, Juan de Pimentel (1576\u20131583). In the 1580s, Caraque\u00f1os started selling food to the Spanish soldiers in Cartagena, who often docked in the coastal city when collecting products from the empire in South America. Wheat was growing increasingly expensive in the Iberian Peninsula, and the Spanish profited from buying it from Caracas farmers. This cemented the city in the empire's trade circuit.During the 16th and 17th centuries, the coast of Venezuela was frequently raided by pirates. With the coastal mountains of the Central Range as a barrier, Caracas was relatively immune to such attacks, compared to other Caribbean coastal settlements, but in 1595 the Preston\u2013Somers expedition landed and around 200 English Privateers, including George Somers and Amyas Preston, crossed the mountains through a little-used pass while the town's defenders were guarding the more frequently used one. Encountering little resistance, the invaders sacked and set fire to the town after a failed ransom negotiation. The city managed to rebuild, using wheat profits and \"a lot of sacrifice\". In the 1620s, farmers in Caracas discovered that Cacao beans could be sold, first selling them to native people of Mexico and quickly growing across the Caribbean. The city became important in the Viceroyalty of New Spain, as well as moving from largely native slave labor to African slaves, the first of the Spanish colonies to become part of the slave trade. The city was successful and operated on cacao and slave trade until the 1650s, when an alhorra blight, the Mexican Inquisition of many of their Portuguese traders, and increased cacao production in Guayaquil greatly affected the market. This and the destructive 1641 earthquake put the city into decline, and they likely began illegally trading with the Dutch Empire, which Caraque\u00f1os later proved sympathetic to; by the 1670s, Caracas had a trading route through Cura\u00e7ao.In 1728, the Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas was founded by the king, and the cacao business grew in importance. Caracas was made one of the three provinces of Nueva Granada, corresponding to Venezuela, in 1739. Over the next three decades the Viceroyalty was variously split, with Caracas province becoming the Venezuela province and then the Captaincy General of Venezuela in 1777, with Caracas as the capital. Venezuela then attempted to become independent, first with the 1797 Gual and Espa\u00f1a conspiracy, based in Caracas, and then the successful 1811 Venezuelan Declaration of Independence. Caracas then came under worse luck: in 1812, an earthquake destroyed Caracas, a quarter of its population migrated in 1814, and the Venezuelan War of Independence continued until 24 June 1821, when Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar defeated royalists in the Battle of Carabobo. Urban reforms only took place towards the end of the 19th century, under Antonio Guzm\u00e1n Blanco: some landmarks were built, but the city remained distinctly colonial until the 1930s.\n\nCaracas grew in size, population, and economic importance during Venezuela's oil boom in the early 20th century. In the 1950s, the metropolitan area of Gran Caracas was developed, and the city began an intensive modernization program, funding public buildings, which continued throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. Cultural landmarks, like the University City of Caracas, designed by modernist architect Carlos Ra\u00fal Villanueva and declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2000; the Caracas Museum of Contemporary Art; and the Teresa Carre\u00f1o Cultural Complex were built, as well as the Caracas Metro and a developed downtown area. Urban development was rapid, leading to the growth of slums on the hillsides surrounding the new city. Much of the city development also fell into disrepair come the end of the 20th century, with the 1980s oil glut and political instability like the Caracazo, meaning maintenance can not be sustained. The economic and social problems persist throughout the capital and country, characterized as the Crisis in Venezuela. Caracas is the most violent city in the world.\n\n\n== Coat of arms ==\nThe coat of arms was adopted in 1591. Sim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar, an ancestor of Venezuelan liberator Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, had been named the first procurator general of the Venezuelan province in 1589. He served as the representative of Venezuela to the Spanish Crown, and vice versa. In 1591, de Bol\u00edvar introduced a petition to King Philip II for a coat of arms, which he granted by Royal Cedula on 4 September that year in San Lorenzo. The coat of arms represents the city's name with the red Santiago (St. James') cross. It originally depicted \"a brown bear rampant on a field of silver, holding between its paws a golden shell with the red cross of Santiago; and its seal is a crown with five golden points\". In the same act, the king declared Caracas as \"The Most Noble and Very Loyal City of Santiago de Le\u00f3n de Caracas\".The anthem of the city is the Marcha a Caracas, written by the composer Tiero Pezzuti de Matteis with the lyrics by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Sarabia and approved in 1984.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nCaracas is contained entirely within a valley of the Venezuelan Central Range, and is separated from the Caribbean coast by a roughly 15-kilometre (9 mi) expanse of El \u00c1vila National Park. The valley is relatively small and quite irregular, and the altitude varies from between 870 and 1,043 meters (2,854 and 3,422 ft) above sea level; the historic center lies at about 900 meters (3,000 feet) above sea level. This, along with the rapid population growth, has profoundly influenced the urban development of the city. The most elevated point of the Capital District, wherein the city is located, is the Pico El \u00c1vila, which rises to 2,159 meters (7,083 feet).The main body of water in Caracas is the Guaire River, which flows across the city and empties into the Tuy River, which is also fed by the El Valle and San Pedro rivers, in addition to numerous streams which descend from El \u00c1vila. The La Mariposa and Camatagua reservoirs provide water to the city. The city is occasionally subject to earthquakes \u2013 notably in 1641 and 1967.\nGeologically, Caracas was formed in the Late Cretaceous period, with much of the rest of the Caribbean, and sits on what is mostly metamorphic rock. Deformation of the land in this period formed the region.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Caracas has a mix of tropical savanna climate (Aw) with subtropical highland (Cwb) influences due to its altitude. Caracas is also intertropical, with precipitation that varies between 900 and 1,300 millimeters (35 and 51 inches) (annual), in the city proper, and up to 2,000 millimeters (79 inches) in some parts of the Mountain range. While Caracas is within the tropics, due to its altitude temperatures are generally not nearly as high as other tropical locations at sea level. The annual average temperature is approximately 23.8 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F), with the average of the coldest month (January) 22.8 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) and the average of the warmest month (July) 25.0 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F), which gives a small annual thermal amplitude of 2.2 \u00b0C (4.0 \u00b0F).In the months of December and January abundant fog may appear, in addition to a sudden nightly drop in temperature, until reaching 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F). This peculiar weather is known by the natives of Caracas as the Pacheco. In addition, nightly temperatures at any time of the year are much (14 to 20 \u00b0C) lower than daytime highs and usually do not remain above 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F), resulting in very pleasant evening temperatures. Hail storms appear in Caracas, although only on rare occasions. Electrical storms are much more frequent, especially between June and October, due to the city being in a closed valley and the orographic action of Cerro El \u00c1vila.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAccording to the population census of 2011 the Caracas proper (Distrito Capital) is over 1.9 million inhabitants, while that of the Metropolitan District of Caracas is estimated at 2.9 million as of 2011. The majority of the population is mixed-race, typically with varying degrees of European, African, Indigenous and occasional Asian ancestry. There is a noteworthy Afro-Venezuelan community. Additionally, the city has a large number of both European Venezuelans and Asian Venezuelans who descend from the massive influx of various immigrants Venezuela received from all across Eurasia during the 20th century; in particular are descendants of Spaniards, Portuguese, Italians, Chinese, Colombians, Germans, Syrians and Lebanese people. In 2020, the poorest 55% of the Caracas population lived on about a third of its land, in poorly-planned slums that are generally dangerous to live in and access.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\n\nVenezuela and its capital, Caracas, are reported to both have among the highest per capita murder rates in the world. Caracas is the city with the highest homicide rate in the world outside of a warzone, with a 2016 rate of around 120 murders per 100,000 people. Most murders and other violent crimes go unsolved, with estimates of the number of unresolved crimes as high as 98%. The U.S. Department of State and British Foreign and Commonwealth Office have issued travel warnings for Venezuela (especially Caracas) due to high rates of crime.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nBusinesses that are located in Caracas include service companies, banks, and malls, among others. It has a largely service-based economy, apart from some industrial activity in its metropolitan area. The Caracas Stock Exchange and Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA) are headquartered here. PDVSA, a state-run organization, is the largest company in Venezuela, and negotiates all the international agreements for the distribution and export of petroleum. When it existed, the airline Viasa had its headquarters in the Torre Viasa.Several international companies and embassies are located in El Rosal and Las Mercedes, in the Caracas area. The city also serves as a hub for communication and transportation infrastructure between the metropolitan area and the rest of the country. Important industries in Caracas include chemicals, textiles, leather, food, iron, and wood products. There are also rubber and cement factories. Its nominal GDP is US$70 billion and the GDP (PPP) per capita is US$24,000.A 2009 United Nations survey reported that the cost of living in Caracas was 89% of that of the survey's baseline city, New York. However, this statistic is based upon a fixed currency-exchange-rate of 2003 and might not be completely realistic, due to the elevated inflation rates of the last several years.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nIn 2013, the World Economic Forum evaluated countries in terms of how successful they were in advertising campaigns to attract foreign visitors. Out of the 140 countries evaluated, Venezuela came last. A major factor that has contributed to the lack of foreign visitors has been poor transport for tourists. Venezuela has limited railway systems and airlines. High crime rates and the negative attitude of the Venezuelan population towards tourism also contributed to the poor evaluation.In an attempt to attract more foreign visitors, the Venezuelan Ministry of Tourism invested in multiple hotel infrastructures. The largest hotel investment has been in the Hotel Alba Caracas. The cost for the general maintenance of the north and south towers of the hotel is approximately 231.5 million Venezuelan bolivars. Although the Venezuelan Ministry of Tourism has taken the initiative to recognize the importance of the tourism industry, the Venezuelan government has not placed the tourism industry as an economic priority. In 2013, the budget for the Ministry of Tourism was only 173.8 million bolivars, while the Ministry of the Youth received approximately 724.6 million bolivars. The tourism industry in Venezuela contributes approximately 3.8 percent of the country GDP. The World Economic Forum predicts Venezuela's GDP to rise to 4.2 percent by 2022.\n\n\n== Government ==\nOn 8 March 2000, the year after a new constitution was introduced in Venezuela, it was decreed in Gaceta Official N\u00b0 36,906 that the Metropolitan District of Caracas would be created and that some of the powers of the Libertador, Chacao, Baruta, Sucre, and El Hatillo municipalities would be delegated to the Alcald\u00eda Mayor, physically located in the large Libertador municipality, in the center of the city. The Metropolitan District of Caracas was suppressed on 20 December 2017 by the Constituent National Assembly of Venezuela.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCaracas is Venezuela's cultural capital, with many restaurants, theaters, museums, and shopping centers. The city is home to many immigrants from Spain, Italy, Portugal, the Middle East, Germany, China, and other Latin American countries.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nProfessional sports teams in the city include the football clubs Caracas F\u00fatbol Club, Deportivo Petare, Atl\u00e9tico Venezuela, SD Centro Italo Venezolano, Estrella Roja FC and Deportivo La Guaira. Deportivo Petare has reached the semi-finals of international tournaments, such as the Copa Libertadores, while the Caracas F\u00fatbol Club has reached the quarterfinals. Baseball teams Tiburones de La Guaira and Leones del Caracas play at University Stadium, with a capacity of nearly 26,000 spectators.The football stadiums in the city include the Olympic Stadium, home to Caracas F\u00fatbol Club and Deportivo La Guaira, with a capacity of 30,000 spectators, and the Br\u00edgido Iriarte Stadium, home to Atl\u00e9tico Venezuela, with a capacity of 12,000 spectators. In basketball, the Cocodrilos de Caracas play their games in the Poliedro de Caracas in the El Para\u00edso neighborhood.Caracas is the seat of the National Institute of Sports and of the Venezuelan Olympic Committee. The city hosted the 1983 Pan American Games.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Central University of Venezuela ===\n\nThe Central University of Venezuela (Universidad Central de Venezuela, UCV) is a public university founded in 1721: it is the oldest university in Venezuela. The university campus was designed by architect Carlos Ra\u00fal Villanueva and declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000.\n\n\n=== Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar University ===\n\nThe Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar University (Universidad Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, USB) is a public institution in Caracas that focuses on science and technology. Its motto is \"La Universidad de la Excelencia\" (\"University of Excellence\").\n\n\n=== Other universities ===\nAcademia Militar de Venezuela\nEscuela de Formaci\u00f3n de Oficiales de las Fuerzas Armadas de Cooperaci\u00f3n\nUniversidad Cat\u00f3lica Andr\u00e9s Bello\nUniversidad Nacional Experimental de la Gran Caracas\nUniversidad Metropolitana\nUniversidad Nacional Experimental de las Artes\nUniversidad Monte\u00e1vila\nUniversidad Nueva Esparta\nUniversidad Santa Maria\nUniversidad Alejandro de Humboldt\nUniversidad Nacional Experimental de las Fuerzas Armadas\nUniversidad Nacional Experimental Sim\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez\nUniversidad Bolivariana de Venezuela\nUniversidad Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Vargas\nUniversidad Pedag\u00f3gica Experimental Libertador\nUniversidad Experimental Polit\u00e9cnica Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre\n\n\n=== International schools ===\nBritish School of Caracas\nColegio Internacional de Caracas\nEscuela Campo Alegre\nInternational Christian School\nTomchei Tmimim\nLyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais de Caracas - Colegio Francia\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nThe Caracas Metro has been in operation since 27 March 1983. With 4 lines, 47 stations and about 10 more to be constructed. It covers a great part of the city and also has an integrated ticket system that combines the route of the Metro with those offered by the Metrob\u00fas, a bus service of the Caracas Metro. In 2010, the first segment of a new ariel cable car system opened, Metrocable which feeds into the larger metro system.\nBuses are the main means of mass transportation. There are two bus systems: the traditional system and the Metrob\u00fas. Other transportation services include the IFE train to and from the Tuy Valley cities of Charallave and C\u00faa; the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar International Airport, the biggest and most important in the country; the metro additional services Caracas Aerial Tramway and Los Teques Metro (connecting Caracas with the suburban city of Los Teques); and the Generalissimo Francisco de Miranda Air Base used by military aviation and government airplanes.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and Sister Cities ===\nCaracas is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities ===\nCaracas is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities from 12 October 1982 establishing brotherly relations with the following cities:\n\n\n== See also ==\nGreater Caracas\nLarge Cities Climate Leadership Group\nLa Silsa\nList of metropolitan areas of Venezuela\nCaracazo\nVenezuela 60-day state of emergency\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Caracas travel guide from Wikivoyage",

        "wiki": "Caracas (, Spanish: [ka\u02c8\u027eakas]), officially Santiago de Le\u00f3n de Caracas, abbreviated as CCS, is the capital and largest city of Venezuela, and the center of the Metropolitan Region of Caracas (or Greater Caracas). Caracas is located along the Guaire River in the northern part of the country, within the Caracas Valley of the Venezuelan coastal mountain range (Cordillera de la Costa). The valley is close to the Caribbean Sea, separated from the coast by a steep 2,200-metre-high (7,200 ft) mountain range, Cerro El \u00c1vila; to the south there are more hills and mountains. The Metropolitan Region of Caracas has an estimated population of almost 5 million inhabitants.\nThe center of the city is still Catedral, located near Bol\u00edvar Square, though some consider the center to be Plaza Venezuela, located in the Los Caobos area. Businesses in the city include service companies, banks, and malls. Caracas has a largely service-based economy, apart from some industrial activity in its metropolitan area. The Caracas Stock Exchange and Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA) are headquartered in Caracas. PDVSA is the largest company in Venezuela. Caracas is also Venezuela's cultural capital, with many restaurants, theaters, museums, and shopping centers. Caracas has some of the tallest skyscrapers in Latin America, such as the Parque Central Towers. The Museum of Contemporary Art of Caracas is one of the most important in South America.Caracas has one of the highest per capita murder rates in the world, with 111.19 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBefore the city was founded in 1567, the valley of Caracas was populated by indigenous peoples. Francisco Fajardo, the son of a Spanish captain and a Guaiqueri cacica, who came from Margarita, began establishing settlements in the area of La Guaira and the Caracas valley between 1555 and 1560. Fajardo attempted to establish a plantation in the valley in 1562 after these unsuccessful coastal towns, but it did not last long: it was destroyed by natives of the region led by Terepaima and Guaicaipuro. Fajardo's 1560 settlement was known as Hato de San Francisco, and another attempt in 1561 by Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Su\u00e1rez was called Villa de San Francisco, and was also destroyed by the same native people. The eventual settlers of Caracas came from Coro, the German capital of their Klein-Venedig colony around the present-day coastal Colombia\u2013Venezuela border; from the 1540s, the colony had been de facto controlled by Spaniards. Moving eastward from Coro, groups of Spanish settlers founded inland towns including Barquisimeto and Valencia before reaching the Caracas valley.On 25 July 1567, Captain Diego de Losada laid the foundations of the city of Santiago de Le\u00f3n de Caracas. De Losada had been commissioned to capture the valley, and was successful by splitting the natives into different groups to work with, then fighting and defeating each of them. The town was the closest to the coast of these new settlements, and the colonists retained a native workforce, which allowed a trade network to develop between Caracas, the interior, and Margarita; the towns further inland produced ample cotton products and beeswax, and Margarita was a rich source of pearls. The Caracas valley had a good environment for both agricultural and arable farming, which contributed to the system of commerce but meant that the town's population was initially sparse, as it was only large enough to support a few farms.In 1577, Caracas became the capital of the Spanish Empire's Venezuela Province under the province's new governor, Juan de Pimentel (1576\u20131583). In the 1580s, Caraque\u00f1os started selling food to the Spanish soldiers in Cartagena, who often docked in the coastal city when collecting products from the empire in South America. Wheat was growing increasingly expensive in the Iberian Peninsula, and the Spanish profited from buying it from Caracas farmers. This cemented the city in the empire's trade circuit.During the 16th and 17th centuries, the coast of Venezuela was frequently raided by pirates. With the coastal mountains of the Central Range as a barrier, Caracas was relatively immune to such attacks, compared to other Caribbean coastal settlements, but in 1595 the Preston\u2013Somers expedition landed and around 200 English Privateers, including George Somers and Amyas Preston, crossed the mountains through a little-used pass while the town's defenders were guarding the more frequently used one. Encountering little resistance, the invaders sacked and set fire to the town after a failed ransom negotiation. The city managed to rebuild, using wheat profits and \"a lot of sacrifice\". In the 1620s, farmers in Caracas discovered that Cacao beans could be sold, first selling them to native people of Mexico and quickly growing across the Caribbean. The city became important in the Viceroyalty of New Spain, as well as moving from largely native slave labor to African slaves, the first of the Spanish colonies to become part of the slave trade. The city was successful and operated on cacao and slave trade until the 1650s, when an alhorra blight, the Mexican Inquisition of many of their Portuguese traders, and increased cacao production in Guayaquil greatly affected the market. This and the destructive 1641 earthquake put the city into decline, and they likely began illegally trading with the Dutch Empire, which Caraque\u00f1os later proved sympathetic to; by the 1670s, Caracas had a trading route through Cura\u00e7ao.In 1728, the Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas was founded by the king, and the cacao business grew in importance. Caracas was made one of the three provinces of Nueva Granada, corresponding to Venezuela, in 1739. Over the next three decades the Viceroyalty was variously split, with Caracas province becoming the Venezuela province and then the Captaincy General of Venezuela in 1777, with Caracas as the capital. Venezuela then attempted to become independent, first with the 1797 Gual and Espa\u00f1a conspiracy, based in Caracas, and then the successful 1811 Venezuelan Declaration of Independence. Caracas then came under worse luck: in 1812, an earthquake destroyed Caracas, a quarter of its population migrated in 1814, and the Venezuelan War of Independence continued until 24 June 1821, when Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar defeated royalists in the Battle of Carabobo. Urban reforms only took place towards the end of the 19th century, under Antonio Guzm\u00e1n Blanco: some landmarks were built, but the city remained distinctly colonial until the 1930s.\n\nCaracas grew in size, population, and economic importance during Venezuela's oil boom in the early 20th century. In the 1950s, the metropolitan area of Gran Caracas was developed, and the city began an intensive modernization program, funding public buildings, which continued throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. Cultural landmarks, like the University City of Caracas, designed by modernist architect Carlos Ra\u00fal Villanueva and declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2000; the Caracas Museum of Contemporary Art; and the Teresa Carre\u00f1o Cultural Complex were built, as well as the Caracas Metro and a developed downtown area. Urban development was rapid, leading to the growth of slums on the hillsides surrounding the new city. Much of the city development also fell into disrepair come the end of the 20th century, with the 1980s oil glut and political instability like the Caracazo, meaning maintenance can not be sustained. The economic and social problems persist throughout the capital and country, characterized as the Crisis in Venezuela. Caracas is the most violent city in the world.\n\n\n== Coat of arms ==\nThe coat of arms was adopted in 1591. Sim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar, an ancestor of Venezuelan liberator Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, had been named the first procurator general of the Venezuelan province in 1589. He served as the representative of Venezuela to the Spanish Crown, and vice versa. In 1591, de Bol\u00edvar introduced a petition to King Philip II for a coat of arms, which he granted by Royal Cedula on 4 September that year in San Lorenzo. The coat of arms represents the city's name with the red Santiago (St. James') cross. It originally depicted \"a brown bear rampant on a field of silver, holding between its paws a golden shell with the red cross of Santiago; and its seal is a crown with five golden points\". In the same act, the king declared Caracas as \"The Most Noble and Very Loyal City of Santiago de Le\u00f3n de Caracas\".The anthem of the city is the Marcha a Caracas, written by the composer Tiero Pezzuti de Matteis with the lyrics by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Sarabia and approved in 1984.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nCaracas is contained entirely within a valley of the Venezuelan Central Range, and is separated from the Caribbean coast by a roughly 15-kilometre (9 mi) expanse of El \u00c1vila National Park. The valley is relatively small and quite irregular, and the altitude varies from between 870 and 1,043 meters (2,854 and 3,422 ft) above sea level; the historic center lies at about 900 meters (3,000 feet) above sea level. This, along with the rapid population growth, has profoundly influenced the urban development of the city. The most elevated point of the Capital District, wherein the city is located, is the Pico El \u00c1vila, which rises to 2,159 meters (7,083 feet).The main body of water in Caracas is the Guaire River, which flows across the city and empties into the Tuy River, which is also fed by the El Valle and San Pedro rivers, in addition to numerous streams which descend from El \u00c1vila. The La Mariposa and Camatagua reservoirs provide water to the city. The city is occasionally subject to earthquakes \u2013 notably in 1641 and 1967.\nGeologically, Caracas was formed in the Late Cretaceous period, with much of the rest of the Caribbean, and sits on what is mostly metamorphic rock. Deformation of the land in this period formed the region.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Caracas has a mix of tropical savanna climate (Aw) with subtropical highland (Cwb) influences due to its altitude. Caracas is also intertropical, with precipitation that varies between 900 and 1,300 millimeters (35 and 51 inches) (annual), in the city proper, and up to 2,000 millimeters (79 inches) in some parts of the Mountain range. While Caracas is within the tropics, due to its altitude temperatures are generally not nearly as high as other tropical locations at sea level. The annual average temperature is approximately 23.8 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F), with the average of the coldest month (January) 22.8 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) and the average of the warmest month (July) 25.0 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F), which gives a small annual thermal amplitude of 2.2 \u00b0C (4.0 \u00b0F).In the months of December and January abundant fog may appear, in addition to a sudden nightly drop in temperature, until reaching 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F). This peculiar weather is known by the natives of Caracas as the Pacheco. In addition, nightly temperatures at any time of the year are much (14 to 20 \u00b0C) lower than daytime highs and usually do not remain above 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F), resulting in very pleasant evening temperatures. Hail storms appear in Caracas, although only on rare occasions. Electrical storms are much more frequent, especially between June and October, due to the city being in a closed valley and the orographic action of Cerro El \u00c1vila.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAccording to the population census of 2011 the Caracas proper (Distrito Capital) is over 1.9 million inhabitants, while that of the Metropolitan District of Caracas is estimated at 2.9 million as of 2011. The majority of the population is mixed-race, typically with varying degrees of European, African, Indigenous and occasional Asian ancestry. There is a noteworthy Afro-Venezuelan community. Additionally, the city has a large number of both European Venezuelans and Asian Venezuelans who descend from the massive influx of various immigrants Venezuela received from all across Eurasia during the 20th century; in particular are descendants of Spaniards, Portuguese, Italians, Chinese, Colombians, Germans, Syrians and Lebanese people. In 2020, the poorest 55% of the Caracas population lived on about a third of its land, in poorly-planned slums that are generally dangerous to live in and access.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\n\nVenezuela and its capital, Caracas, are reported to both have among the highest per capita murder rates in the world. Caracas is the city with the highest homicide rate in the world outside of a warzone, with a 2016 rate of around 120 murders per 100,000 people. Most murders and other violent crimes go unsolved, with estimates of the number of unresolved crimes as high as 98%. The U.S. Department of State and British Foreign and Commonwealth Office have issued travel warnings for Venezuela (especially Caracas) due to high rates of crime.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nBusinesses that are located in Caracas include service companies, banks, and malls, among others. It has a largely service-based economy, apart from some industrial activity in its metropolitan area. The Caracas Stock Exchange and Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA) are headquartered here. PDVSA, a state-run organization, is the largest company in Venezuela, and negotiates all the international agreements for the distribution and export of petroleum. When it existed, the airline Viasa had its headquarters in the Torre Viasa.Several international companies and embassies are located in El Rosal and Las Mercedes, in the Caracas area. The city also serves as a hub for communication and transportation infrastructure between the metropolitan area and the rest of the country. Important industries in Caracas include chemicals, textiles, leather, food, iron, and wood products. There are also rubber and cement factories. Its nominal GDP is US$70 billion and the GDP (PPP) per capita is US$24,000.A 2009 United Nations survey reported that the cost of living in Caracas was 89% of that of the survey's baseline city, New York. However, this statistic is based upon a fixed currency-exchange-rate of 2003 and might not be completely realistic, due to the elevated inflation rates of the last several years.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nIn 2013, the World Economic Forum evaluated countries in terms of how successful they were in advertising campaigns to attract foreign visitors. Out of the 140 countries evaluated, Venezuela came last. A major factor that has contributed to the lack of foreign visitors has been poor transport for tourists. Venezuela has limited railway systems and airlines. High crime rates and the negative attitude of the Venezuelan population towards tourism also contributed to the poor evaluation.In an attempt to attract more foreign visitors, the Venezuelan Ministry of Tourism invested in multiple hotel infrastructures. The largest hotel investment has been in the Hotel Alba Caracas. The cost for the general maintenance of the north and south towers of the hotel is approximately 231.5 million Venezuelan bolivars. Although the Venezuelan Ministry of Tourism has taken the initiative to recognize the importance of the tourism industry, the Venezuelan government has not placed the tourism industry as an economic priority. In 2013, the budget for the Ministry of Tourism was only 173.8 million bolivars, while the Ministry of the Youth received approximately 724.6 million bolivars. The tourism industry in Venezuela contributes approximately 3.8 percent of the country GDP. The World Economic Forum predicts Venezuela's GDP to rise to 4.2 percent by 2022.\n\n\n== Government ==\nOn 8 March 2000, the year after a new constitution was introduced in Venezuela, it was decreed in Gaceta Official N\u00b0 36,906 that the Metropolitan District of Caracas would be created and that some of the powers of the Libertador, Chacao, Baruta, Sucre, and El Hatillo municipalities would be delegated to the Alcald\u00eda Mayor, physically located in the large Libertador municipality, in the center of the city. The Metropolitan District of Caracas was suppressed on 20 December 2017 by the Constituent National Assembly of Venezuela.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCaracas is Venezuela's cultural capital, with many restaurants, theaters, museums, and shopping centers. The city is home to many immigrants from Spain, Italy, Portugal, the Middle East, Germany, China, and other Latin American countries.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nProfessional sports teams in the city include the football clubs Caracas F\u00fatbol Club, Deportivo Petare, Atl\u00e9tico Venezuela, SD Centro Italo Venezolano, Estrella Roja FC and Deportivo La Guaira. Deportivo Petare has reached the semi-finals of international tournaments, such as the Copa Libertadores, while the Caracas F\u00fatbol Club has reached the quarterfinals. Baseball teams Tiburones de La Guaira and Leones del Caracas play at University Stadium, with a capacity of nearly 26,000 spectators.The football stadiums in the city include the Olympic Stadium, home to Caracas F\u00fatbol Club and Deportivo La Guaira, with a capacity of 30,000 spectators, and the Br\u00edgido Iriarte Stadium, home to Atl\u00e9tico Venezuela, with a capacity of 12,000 spectators. In basketball, the Cocodrilos de Caracas play their games in the Poliedro de Caracas in the El Para\u00edso neighborhood.Caracas is the seat of the National Institute of Sports and of the Venezuelan Olympic Committee. The city hosted the 1983 Pan American Games.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Central University of Venezuela ===\n\nThe Central University of Venezuela (Universidad Central de Venezuela, UCV) is a public university founded in 1721: it is the oldest university in Venezuela. The university campus was designed by architect Carlos Ra\u00fal Villanueva and declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000.\n\n\n=== Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar University ===\n\nThe Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar University (Universidad Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, USB) is a public institution in Caracas that focuses on science and technology. Its motto is \"La Universidad de la Excelencia\" (\"University of Excellence\").\n\n\n=== Other universities ===\nAcademia Militar de Venezuela\nEscuela de Formaci\u00f3n de Oficiales de las Fuerzas Armadas de Cooperaci\u00f3n\nUniversidad Cat\u00f3lica Andr\u00e9s Bello\nUniversidad Nacional Experimental de la Gran Caracas\nUniversidad Metropolitana\nUniversidad Nacional Experimental de las Artes\nUniversidad Monte\u00e1vila\nUniversidad Nueva Esparta\nUniversidad Santa Maria\nUniversidad Alejandro de Humboldt\nUniversidad Nacional Experimental de las Fuerzas Armadas\nUniversidad Nacional Experimental Sim\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez\nUniversidad Bolivariana de Venezuela\nUniversidad Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Vargas\nUniversidad Pedag\u00f3gica Experimental Libertador\nUniversidad Experimental Polit\u00e9cnica Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre\n\n\n=== International schools ===\nBritish School of Caracas\nColegio Internacional de Caracas\nEscuela Campo Alegre\nInternational Christian School\nTomchei Tmimim\nLyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais de Caracas - Colegio Francia\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nThe Caracas Metro has been in operation since 27 March 1983. With 4 lines, 47 stations and about 10 more to be constructed. It covers a great part of the city and also has an integrated ticket system that combines the route of the Metro with those offered by the Metrob\u00fas, a bus service of the Caracas Metro. In 2010, the first segment of a new ariel cable car system opened, Metrocable which feeds into the larger metro system.\nBuses are the main means of mass transportation. There are two bus systems: the traditional system and the Metrob\u00fas. Other transportation services include the IFE train to and from the Tuy Valley cities of Charallave and C\u00faa; the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar International Airport, the biggest and most important in the country; the metro additional services Caracas Aerial Tramway and Los Teques Metro (connecting Caracas with the suburban city of Los Teques); and the Generalissimo Francisco de Miranda Air Base used by military aviation and government airplanes.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and Sister Cities ===\nCaracas is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities ===\nCaracas is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities from 12 October 1982 establishing brotherly relations with the following cities:\n\n\n== See also ==\nGreater Caracas\nLarge Cities Climate Leadership Group\nLa Silsa\nList of metropolitan areas of Venezuela\nCaracazo\nVenezuela 60-day state of emergency\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Caracas travel guide from Wikivoyage",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Birthplace of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar (Spanish: Casa Natal del Libertador Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar) is a seventeenth-century house in the Venezuelan capital city Caracas where the hero of Venezuelan and Latin American independence, Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, was born. Now a significant tourist attraction, the building is located in a little street off the Plaza San Jacinto, a block east of the Plaza Bol\u00edvar.  It is one of only a few houses from the colonial era which survive in central Caracas.\nOne of the adjacent buildings serves as a Bolivarian museum (museo bolivariano). The birthplace and museum together present memorabilia connected with Bolivar and the Venezuelan War of Independence, along with weapons and furniture of that period.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe house on San Jacinto Street was completed in the 1640s. \nBolivar was born to Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda de la Concepci\u00f3n Palacios y Blanco and Coronel Don Juan Vicente Bol\u00edvar y Ponte in the bedroom here on 24 July 1783, and was the fourth child of the aristocratic couple of the Creole family who had migrated from Spain 200 years earlier. In 1806, the house was sold to a relation of Bol\u00edvar called Madriz.  The house remained in his family until 1876 when it was bought by President Antonio Guzm\u00e1n Blanco.  Guzm\u00e1n Blanco was an admirer of Bol\u00edvar, and erected his equestrian statue in the Plaza Bolivar.\nReconstruction of the house was ordered on October 28, 1916, with the purpose of preserving Venezuela's cultural heritage, and to honor its national hero, but it was not until 1920 when the house actually underwent reconstruction with added refinements.\nIt was inaugurated on 5 January 1921 on the anniversary of the Battle of Carabobo.\nThe building became a listed National Monument on 25 July 2002.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe single-storey building occupies a relatively narrow plot, 23 meters wide and 60 meters deep. It has wide corridors and courtyards and patios.\n\nThe reconstruction is Spanish Colonial in character, but the aim of the restorers was to enhance the building, rather than adopt criteria of strict authenticity. New materials were introduced; for example the facade facing the street has been refaced in stone, which is atypical of colonial-era houses in Venezuela. Other walls are whitewashed: the structure underneath is now made of brick, although it was probably made of adobe originally.\nAt the time of Bol\u00edvar's birth, the home was opulently furnished with mahogany chests and tables, upholstered chairs, decorated mirrors; damask curtains, gold cornices, and bright chandeliers. Period furniture and artifacts belonging to Bol\u00edvar can now be seen in the building. The house has a sequence of courtyards surrounded by corridors and rooms. In the main courtyard is the baptismal font used for Bol\u00edvar's baptism, originally located in Caracas Cathedral. The second courtyard serves as ventilation to the kitchen and other rooms, and includes a replica of a water fountain from the time of Bol\u00edvar. At the end of the house is a small pen-laundry and stable.\n\nAmong those which stand out are the main room, the bedroom (site where Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar was born) and the cabinet, which occupy the front body of the building. They are decorated with murals executed by the painter Tito Salas. These very large paintings by Salas depict Bol\u00edvar's heroic battles and scenes during his life. In one painting at the house, Salas depicts Bol\u00edvar on a white mountain with a white bearded man with angel wings. There are also paintings of his life scenes by Mart\u00edn Tovar y Tovar and Arturo Michelena, including his christening, wedding and death. There is also a tree in the backyard of the house, which is famous as it is said to be the location where Simon was taught by Rodr\u00edguez.Bolivar\u2019s  childhood mementos such as his library and personal records are also exhibited.\n\n\n== Other homes of Bol\u00edvar ==\n\n\n=== Venezuela ===\nDespite the Venezuelan authorities' assertion that Bol\u00edvar was born in Caracas, there have been claims that the much poorer town of San Mateo, Aragua, was in fact his true birthplace. The claims are based on the fact that Bol\u00edvar's mother had certainly been living at the San Mateo ranch shortly before his birth and that as a child, Bol\u00edvar spent much of his time there.There is also another family home of Bolivar which has historical importance. It was the venue where the independence movement was launched on 19 April 1810 after the freedom fighters had conspired to act during their first meeting at this home in 1818. Eventually, as result of this movement Venezuela got its independence from Spain, on 5 July 1815.\n\n\n=== Colombia ===\nQuinta de Bol\u00edvar\nQuinta de San Pedro Alejandrino\n\n\n== Gallerys ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website Red Museos Bolivarianos (Casa Natal-Museo Bolivariano) (in Spanish)",

A basilica is a church with certain privileges conferred on it by the Pope.\nNot all churches with \"basilica\" in their title actually have the ecclesiastical status, which can lead to confusion, since it is also an architectural term for a church-building style.\nIn the 18th century, the term took on a canonical sense, unrelated to this architectural style. Basilicas in this canonical sense are divided into major (\"greater\") and minor basilicas. Today only four, all in the Diocese of Rome, are classified as major basilicas: the major basilicas of St John Lateran, St Peter's, St Paul outside the Walls, and St Mary Major. The other canonical basilicas are minor basilicas.\nBy canon law no Catholic church can be honoured with the title of basilica unless by apostolic grant or from immemorial custom. The Basilica di San Nicola da Tolentino was the first minor basilica to be canonically created, in 1783. The 1917 Code of Canon Law officially recognised churches using the title of basilica from immemorial custom as having such a right to the title of minor basilica. Such churches are referred to as immemorial basilicas.\n\n\n== Basilicas in Asia ==\n\n\n== Basilicas in Africa ==\n\n\n== Basilicas in North and Central America and the Caribbean ==\n\n\n== Basilicas in South America ==\n\n\n== Basilicas in Australia and Oceania ==\n\n\n== Basilicas in Europe ==\n\n\n== Statistics ==\nAs of November 2019, there were 1,690 basilicas (four of them major; the rest minor) in the world.\n\n\n=== Countries with more than 100 basilicas ===\nItaly (573)\nFrance (168)\nSpain (123)\nPoland (105)\n\n\n=== Countries with between 10 and 100 basilicas ===\n\n\n=== Cities and municipalities with more than 10 basilicas ===\nRome (66)\nBuenos Aires (15)\nKrak\u00f3w (13)\nBologna (11)\nFlorence (11)\n\n\n=== Cities and municipalities with between five and 10 basilicas ===\nNaples (9)\nBarcelona (9)\nMilan (9)\nVenice (8)\nCologne (6)\nLima (6)\nMadrid (6)\nSantiago (6)\n\n\n=== Cities and municipalities with five basilicas ===\nJerusalem\nParis\nPiacenza\nGenoa\nTurin\n\n\n=== Cities and municipalities with four basilicas ===\n\n\n=== Cities and municipalities with three basilicas ===\n\n\n=== Cities and municipalities with two basilicas ===\n\n\n== Other basilicas ==\nThe following churches are often referred to as basilicas, but there does not appear to be evidence of their officially holding that status:\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of basilicas in Italy\nBasilicas of New Zealand\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nList of all Minor Basilicas from GCatholic\nList of all Basilicas in India from Notes on India\nBunson, Matthew, ed.

        "wiki": "Caracas (, Spanish: [ka\u02c8\u027eakas]), officially Santiago de Le\u00f3n de Caracas, abbreviated as CCS, is the capital and largest city of Venezuela, and the center of the Metropolitan Region of Caracas (or Greater Caracas). Caracas is located along the Guaire River in the northern part of the country, within the Caracas Valley of the Venezuelan coastal mountain range (Cordillera de la Costa). The valley is close to the Caribbean Sea, separated from the coast by a steep 2,200-metre-high (7,200 ft) mountain range, Cerro El \u00c1vila; to the south there are more hills and mountains. The Metropolitan Region of Caracas has an estimated population of almost 5 million inhabitants.\nThe center of the city is still Catedral, located near Bol\u00edvar Square, though some consider the center to be Plaza Venezuela, located in the Los Caobos area. Businesses in the city include service companies, banks, and malls. Caracas has a largely service-based economy, apart from some industrial activity in its metropolitan area. The Caracas Stock Exchange and Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA) are headquartered in Caracas. PDVSA is the largest company in Venezuela. Caracas is also Venezuela's cultural capital, with many restaurants, theaters, museums, and shopping centers. Caracas has some of the tallest skyscrapers in Latin America, such as the Parque Central Towers. The Museum of Contemporary Art of Caracas is one of the most important in South America.Caracas has one of the highest per capita murder rates in the world, with 111.19 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBefore the city was founded in 1567, the valley of Caracas was populated by indigenous peoples. Francisco Fajardo, the son of a Spanish captain and a Guaiqueri cacica, who came from Margarita, began establishing settlements in the area of La Guaira and the Caracas valley between 1555 and 1560. Fajardo attempted to establish a plantation in the valley in 1562 after these unsuccessful coastal towns, but it did not last long: it was destroyed by natives of the region led by Terepaima and Guaicaipuro. Fajardo's 1560 settlement was known as Hato de San Francisco, and another attempt in 1561 by Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Su\u00e1rez was called Villa de San Francisco, and was also destroyed by the same native people. The eventual settlers of Caracas came from Coro, the German capital of their Klein-Venedig colony around the present-day coastal Colombia\u2013Venezuela border; from the 1540s, the colony had been de facto controlled by Spaniards. Moving eastward from Coro, groups of Spanish settlers founded inland towns including Barquisimeto and Valencia before reaching the Caracas valley.On 25 July 1567, Captain Diego de Losada laid the foundations of the city of Santiago de Le\u00f3n de Caracas. De Losada had been commissioned to capture the valley, and was successful by splitting the natives into different groups to work with, then fighting and defeating each of them. The town was the closest to the coast of these new settlements, and the colonists retained a native workforce, which allowed a trade network to develop between Caracas, the interior, and Margarita; the towns further inland produced ample cotton products and beeswax, and Margarita was a rich source of pearls. The Caracas valley had a good environment for both agricultural and arable farming, which contributed to the system of commerce but meant that the town's population was initially sparse, as it was only large enough to support a few farms.In 1577, Caracas became the capital of the Spanish Empire's Venezuela Province under the province's new governor, Juan de Pimentel (1576\u20131583). In the 1580s, Caraque\u00f1os started selling food to the Spanish soldiers in Cartagena, who often docked in the coastal city when collecting products from the empire in South America. Wheat was growing increasingly expensive in the Iberian Peninsula, and the Spanish profited from buying it from Caracas farmers. This cemented the city in the empire's trade circuit.During the 16th and 17th centuries, the coast of Venezuela was frequently raided by pirates. With the coastal mountains of the Central Range as a barrier, Caracas was relatively immune to such attacks, compared to other Caribbean coastal settlements, but in 1595 the Preston\u2013Somers expedition landed and around 200 English Privateers, including George Somers and Amyas Preston, crossed the mountains through a little-used pass while the town's defenders were guarding the more frequently used one. Encountering little resistance, the invaders sacked and set fire to the town after a failed ransom negotiation. The city managed to rebuild, using wheat profits and \"a lot of sacrifice\". In the 1620s, farmers in Caracas discovered that Cacao beans could be sold, first selling them to native people of Mexico and quickly growing across the Caribbean. The city became important in the Viceroyalty of New Spain, as well as moving from largely native slave labor to African slaves, the first of the Spanish colonies to become part of the slave trade. The city was successful and operated on cacao and slave trade until the 1650s, when an alhorra blight, the Mexican Inquisition of many of their Portuguese traders, and increased cacao production in Guayaquil greatly affected the market. This and the destructive 1641 earthquake put the city into decline, and they likely began illegally trading with the Dutch Empire, which Caraque\u00f1os later proved sympathetic to; by the 1670s, Caracas had a trading route through Cura\u00e7ao.In 1728, the Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas was founded by the king, and the cacao business grew in importance. Caracas was made one of the three provinces of Nueva Granada, corresponding to Venezuela, in 1739. Over the next three decades the Viceroyalty was variously split, with Caracas province becoming the Venezuela province and then the Captaincy General of Venezuela in 1777, with Caracas as the capital. Venezuela then attempted to become independent, first with the 1797 Gual and Espa\u00f1a conspiracy, based in Caracas, and then the successful 1811 Venezuelan Declaration of Independence. Caracas then came under worse luck: in 1812, an earthquake destroyed Caracas, a quarter of its population migrated in 1814, and the Venezuelan War of Independence continued until 24 June 1821, when Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar defeated royalists in the Battle of Carabobo. Urban reforms only took place towards the end of the 19th century, under Antonio Guzm\u00e1n Blanco: some landmarks were built, but the city remained distinctly colonial until the 1930s.\n\nCaracas grew in size, population, and economic importance during Venezuela's oil boom in the early 20th century. In the 1950s, the metropolitan area of Gran Caracas was developed, and the city began an intensive modernization program, funding public buildings, which continued throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. Cultural landmarks, like the University City of Caracas, designed by modernist architect Carlos Ra\u00fal Villanueva and declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2000; the Caracas Museum of Contemporary Art; and the Teresa Carre\u00f1o Cultural Complex were built, as well as the Caracas Metro and a developed downtown area. Urban development was rapid, leading to the growth of slums on the hillsides surrounding the new city. Much of the city development also fell into disrepair come the end of the 20th century, with the 1980s oil glut and political instability like the Caracazo, meaning maintenance can not be sustained. The economic and social problems persist throughout the capital and country, characterized as the Crisis in Venezuela. Caracas is the most violent city in the world.\n\n\n== Coat of arms ==\nThe coat of arms was adopted in 1591. Sim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar, an ancestor of Venezuelan liberator Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, had been named the first procurator general of the Venezuelan province in 1589. He served as the representative of Venezuela to the Spanish Crown, and vice versa. In 1591, de Bol\u00edvar introduced a petition to King Philip II for a coat of arms, which he granted by Royal Cedula on 4 September that year in San Lorenzo. The coat of arms represents the city's name with the red Santiago (St. James') cross. It originally depicted \"a brown bear rampant on a field of silver, holding between its paws a golden shell with the red cross of Santiago; and its seal is a crown with five golden points\". In the same act, the king declared Caracas as \"The Most Noble and Very Loyal City of Santiago de Le\u00f3n de Caracas\".The anthem of the city is the Marcha a Caracas, written by the composer Tiero Pezzuti de Matteis with the lyrics by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Sarabia and approved in 1984.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nCaracas is contained entirely within a valley of the Venezuelan Central Range, and is separated from the Caribbean coast by a roughly 15-kilometre (9 mi) expanse of El \u00c1vila National Park. The valley is relatively small and quite irregular, and the altitude varies from between 870 and 1,043 meters (2,854 and 3,422 ft) above sea level; the historic center lies at about 900 meters (3,000 feet) above sea level. This, along with the rapid population growth, has profoundly influenced the urban development of the city. The most elevated point of the Capital District, wherein the city is located, is the Pico El \u00c1vila, which rises to 2,159 meters (7,083 feet).The main body of water in Caracas is the Guaire River, which flows across the city and empties into the Tuy River, which is also fed by the El Valle and San Pedro rivers, in addition to numerous streams which descend from El \u00c1vila. The La Mariposa and Camatagua reservoirs provide water to the city. The city is occasionally subject to earthquakes \u2013 notably in 1641 and 1967.\nGeologically, Caracas was formed in the Late Cretaceous period, with much of the rest of the Caribbean, and sits on what is mostly metamorphic rock. Deformation of the land in this period formed the region.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Caracas has a mix of tropical savanna climate (Aw) with subtropical highland (Cwb) influences due to its altitude. Caracas is also intertropical, with precipitation that varies between 900 and 1,300 millimeters (35 and 51 inches) (annual), in the city proper, and up to 2,000 millimeters (79 inches) in some parts of the Mountain range. While Caracas is within the tropics, due to its altitude temperatures are generally not nearly as high as other tropical locations at sea level. The annual average temperature is approximately 23.8 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F), with the average of the coldest month (January) 22.8 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) and the average of the warmest month (July) 25.0 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F), which gives a small annual thermal amplitude of 2.2 \u00b0C (4.0 \u00b0F).In the months of December and January abundant fog may appear, in addition to a sudden nightly drop in temperature, until reaching 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F). This peculiar weather is known by the natives of Caracas as the Pacheco. In addition, nightly temperatures at any time of the year are much (14 to 20 \u00b0C) lower than daytime highs and usually do not remain above 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F), resulting in very pleasant evening temperatures. Hail storms appear in Caracas, although only on rare occasions. Electrical storms are much more frequent, especially between June and October, due to the city being in a closed valley and the orographic action of Cerro El \u00c1vila.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAccording to the population census of 2011 the Caracas proper (Distrito Capital) is over 1.9 million inhabitants, while that of the Metropolitan District of Caracas is estimated at 2.9 million as of 2011. The majority of the population is mixed-race, typically with varying degrees of European, African, Indigenous and occasional Asian ancestry. There is a noteworthy Afro-Venezuelan community. Additionally, the city has a large number of both European Venezuelans and Asian Venezuelans who descend from the massive influx of various immigrants Venezuela received from all across Eurasia during the 20th century; in particular are descendants of Spaniards, Portuguese, Italians, Chinese, Colombians, Germans, Syrians and Lebanese people. In 2020, the poorest 55% of the Caracas population lived on about a third of its land, in poorly-planned slums that are generally dangerous to live in and access.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\n\nVenezuela and its capital, Caracas, are reported to both have among the highest per capita murder rates in the world. Caracas is the city with the highest homicide rate in the world outside of a warzone, with a 2016 rate of around 120 murders per 100,000 people. Most murders and other violent crimes go unsolved, with estimates of the number of unresolved crimes as high as 98%. The U.S. Department of State and British Foreign and Commonwealth Office have issued travel warnings for Venezuela (especially Caracas) due to high rates of crime.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nBusinesses that are located in Caracas include service companies, banks, and malls, among others. It has a largely service-based economy, apart from some industrial activity in its metropolitan area. The Caracas Stock Exchange and Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA) are headquartered here. PDVSA, a state-run organization, is the largest company in Venezuela, and negotiates all the international agreements for the distribution and export of petroleum. When it existed, the airline Viasa had its headquarters in the Torre Viasa.Several international companies and embassies are located in El Rosal and Las Mercedes, in the Caracas area. The city also serves as a hub for communication and transportation infrastructure between the metropolitan area and the rest of the country. Important industries in Caracas include chemicals, textiles, leather, food, iron, and wood products. There are also rubber and cement factories. Its nominal GDP is US$70 billion and the GDP (PPP) per capita is US$24,000.A 2009 United Nations survey reported that the cost of living in Caracas was 89% of that of the survey's baseline city, New York. However, this statistic is based upon a fixed currency-exchange-rate of 2003 and might not be completely realistic, due to the elevated inflation rates of the last several years.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nIn 2013, the World Economic Forum evaluated countries in terms of how successful they were in advertising campaigns to attract foreign visitors. Out of the 140 countries evaluated, Venezuela came last. A major factor that has contributed to the lack of foreign visitors has been poor transport for tourists. Venezuela has limited railway systems and airlines. High crime rates and the negative attitude of the Venezuelan population towards tourism also contributed to the poor evaluation.In an attempt to attract more foreign visitors, the Venezuelan Ministry of Tourism invested in multiple hotel infrastructures. The largest hotel investment has been in the Hotel Alba Caracas. The cost for the general maintenance of the north and south towers of the hotel is approximately 231.5 million Venezuelan bolivars. Although the Venezuelan Ministry of Tourism has taken the initiative to recognize the importance of the tourism industry, the Venezuelan government has not placed the tourism industry as an economic priority. In 2013, the budget for the Ministry of Tourism was only 173.8 million bolivars, while the Ministry of the Youth received approximately 724.6 million bolivars. The tourism industry in Venezuela contributes approximately 3.8 percent of the country GDP. The World Economic Forum predicts Venezuela's GDP to rise to 4.2 percent by 2022.\n\n\n== Government ==\nOn 8 March 2000, the year after a new constitution was introduced in Venezuela, it was decreed in Gaceta Official N\u00b0 36,906 that the Metropolitan District of Caracas would be created and that some of the powers of the Libertador, Chacao, Baruta, Sucre, and El Hatillo municipalities would be delegated to the Alcald\u00eda Mayor, physically located in the large Libertador municipality, in the center of the city. The Metropolitan District of Caracas was suppressed on 20 December 2017 by the Constituent National Assembly of Venezuela.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCaracas is Venezuela's cultural capital, with many restaurants, theaters, museums, and shopping centers. The city is home to many immigrants from Spain, Italy, Portugal, the Middle East, Germany, China, and other Latin American countries.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nProfessional sports teams in the city include the football clubs Caracas F\u00fatbol Club, Deportivo Petare, Atl\u00e9tico Venezuela, SD Centro Italo Venezolano, Estrella Roja FC and Deportivo La Guaira. Deportivo Petare has reached the semi-finals of international tournaments, such as the Copa Libertadores, while the Caracas F\u00fatbol Club has reached the quarterfinals. Baseball teams Tiburones de La Guaira and Leones del Caracas play at University Stadium, with a capacity of nearly 26,000 spectators.The football stadiums in the city include the Olympic Stadium, home to Caracas F\u00fatbol Club and Deportivo La Guaira, with a capacity of 30,000 spectators, and the Br\u00edgido Iriarte Stadium, home to Atl\u00e9tico Venezuela, with a capacity of 12,000 spectators.

The other 36 ha have been developed into a zoological park showcasing seven specific environments.As a result of the crisis in Venezuela, as of July 2017, the Caricuao Zoo was in severe decline. Budget cuts led to shortage of staff and animal feed, which in turn led to neglect and malnourishment. Many of the animals have died or were stolen. The zoo is down to 150 animals from the 700 housed in 2006. Attendance has also dropped due to lack of security and increase in robberies.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChorros de Milla Zoo\nParque del Este\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCaricuao Zoo",

The first Marian image Pontifically crowned was the painted image of La Madonna della Febbre (Madonna of Fever) on 27 May 1631 by Pope Urban VIII through the Vatican Chapter located at the Sacristy of Saint Peter's Basilica.\nThe prescription of the solemn rite to crown venerated images is embedded in the Ordo Coronandi Imaginem Beatae Mariae Virginis published by the Holy Office on 25 May 1981. Prior to 1989, papal bulls concerning the authorization of canonical coronations were handwritten on parchment. After 1989, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments began issuing the specific recognition to crown a religious image, spelling out its approved devotional title and authorizing Papal legate.

        "wiki": "The Sabana Grande district is divided into several middle class neighborhoods located in the Parroquia El Recreo of the Libertador Municipality, in the geographical center of the Metropolitan District of Caracas and owes its name to the old town of Sabana Grande.\n\n\n== History of Sabana Grande ==\n\n\n=== Foundation and early years ===\nOriginally, the area where today stands the commercial and financial sector Sabana Grande, was an agricultural town in which there were some coffee plantations, such as Hacienda Ibarra, which extended to the Central University of Venezuela and part of the neighborhoods Colinas de Bello Monte and Las Mercedes. At first, the town of Sabana Grande was connected to the agricultural community of Chacao.  Hacienda Ibarra was expropriated during the government of Isa\u00edas Medina Angarita to modernize the city and part of the previous house is still conserved in the campus of the Central University of Venezuela. The main house of this hacienda was located in Bello Monte of the financial district Sabana Grande, and this house no longer exists. The town of Sabana Grande was the communication route between Caracas to the large plantations (haciendas) located on the outskirts of the city.Although PDVSA La Estancia has done a research, they have no consensus on the date of foundation of Parroquia El Recreo. Some say that around 1852, the area was elevated to a foreign parish by the Caracas authorities, which served to overcome its status as a hamlet, given the significant number of inhabitants and buildings. Others say that, Parroquia El Recreo was created on November 22, 1864 and not in 1852. According to the historian Manuel Landaeta Rosales (1847-1920), El Recreo was founded on November 22, 1952 as a civil parish. Later, on February, 22, 1964, it was founded as an ecclesiastical parish.On November 4, 1870, the area was integrated into the city of Caracas by the Caracas authorities in the government of Antonio Guzm\u00e1n Blanco and was named \"The Immaculate Conception and San Jose del Recreo\" by the presbyter Jose Botel Peraza. Over time, Sabana Grande became a popular summer destination for college students and that's why the area was known as \"El Recreo\". Sabana Grande was definitively separated from Chacao when it was annexed as the eastern parish of Caracas.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nTowards the end of the 19th century, the Hippodrome of Sabana Grande (Las Delicias area), run by the Jockey Club of Caracas, operated in the area, and its executives included the prominent artist Arturo Michelena. This hippodrome was the first in Caracas and worked in the area until 1906 when the racecourse was moved to El Para\u00edso neighborhood.This important commercial district of Caracas also had the first two commercial centers of Caracas: The East Shopping Center (on Casanova Avenue) and The Gran Avenida, formerly known as Fifth Avenue Shopping Center. The first one is still open on \"Avenida Casanova\" and the second one was located at the exit of the Metro Plaza Venezuela, where the bus stop to San Antonio de Los Altos is located. The East Sabana Grande Shopping Center was built by the architect Diego Carbonell, with a ring of shops around a central parking lot separate from the street, which meant that some stores had double access.\n\n\n=== Caracas Metro ===\nIn the eighties, the construction of Sabana Grande station of Caracas Metro brought more people to the financial district of Sabana Grande. Since then, Sabana Grande became a place of mass recreation. The financial district of Sabana Grande has three metro stations: Plaza Venezuela, Sabana Grande and Chaca\u00edto. This district is the best covered by the Caracas Metro. The boulevard of Sabana Grande was built from the surroundings of \"La Previsora Tower\" to the Plaza Bri\u00f3n de Chaca\u00edto. The Plaza Bri\u00f3n de Chaca\u00edto was built according to the commercial and financial district of Sabana Grande, despite belonging to Chacao Municipality today. As a result of the problems of authority between the Caracas Metro and the Libertador Municipality, the Sabana Grande district lost maintenance and surveillance in the 1990s. In 1994, the Caracas Metro finally granted the administration of the Boulevard of Sabana Grande to the Libertador Municipality of Caracas.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBoulevard of Sabana Grande\nAltamira (Caracas)\nCity Market Shopping Mall\nEl Rosal, Caracas\nLas Mercedes (district in Caracas)\nLibertador Municipality\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nYoutube: Sabana Grande in 1987\nThe administrative division of the Libertador Municipality of Caracas (includes the zoning plans of the Sabana Grande district)\nSabana Grande Online \u2013 Listado de comercios, Im\u00e1genes y noticias acerca del boulevard\nBoulevard de Sabana Grande diagn\u00f3stico integral para su rehabilitaci\u00f3n\nProyecto de Rehabilitaci\u00f3n Integral Bulevar de Sabana Grande\nEl Nacional: Narran las historias m\u00ednimas de Sabana Grande Emyly Avenda\u00f1o. 24 de marzo de 2013\nYoutube: Antes y ahora en el Bulevar de Sabana Grande (Caracas \u2013 Venezuela)",

        "wiki": "Guatemala City (Spanish: Ciudad de Guatemala), locally known as Guatemala or Guate, officially Ciudad de Guatemala (art. 231 of the Political Constitution of the Republic of Guatemala) , is the capital and largest city of Guatemala, and the most populous urban area in Central America. The city is located in the south-central part of the country, nestled in a mountain valley called Valle de la Ermita (English: Hermitage Valley). It is estimated that its population is about 1 million. Guatemala City is also the capital of the Municipality of Guatemala and of the Guatemala Department.\nGuatemala City is the site of the Mayan city of Kaminaljuyu, founded around 1500 BC. Following the Spanish conquest, a new town was established, and in 1776 it was made capital of the Kingdom of Guatemala. In 1821, Guatemala City was the scene of the declaration of independence of Central America from Spain, after which it became the capital of the newly established United Provinces of Central America (later the Federal Republic of Central America). In 1847, Guatemala declared itself an independent republic, with Guatemala City as its capital. The city was almost completely destroyed by the 1917\u201318 earthquakes. Reconstructions following the earthquakes have resulted in a more modern architectural landscape.Today, Guatemala City is the political, cultural, and economic center of Guatemala. It is served by La Aurora International Airport.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nHuman settlement on the present site of Guatemala City began with the Maya who built a city at Kaminaljuyu. The Spanish colonists established a small town, which was made a capital city in 1775. At this period the Central Square with the Cathedral and Royal Palace were constructed. After Central American independence from Spain the city became the capital of the United Provinces of Central America in 1821.\nThe 19th century saw the construction of the monumental Carrera Theater in the 1850s, and the Presidential Palace in the 1890s. At this time the city was expanding around the 30 de junio Boulevard and elsewhere, displacing native settlements from the ancient site. Earthquakes in 1917\u20131918 destroyed many historic structures. Under Jorge Ubico in the 1930s a hippodrome and many new public buildings were constructed, although peripheral poor neighborhoods that formed after the 1917\u20131918 earthquakes continued to lack basic amenities.\nDuring the Guatemalan Civil War, terror attacks beginning with the burning of the Spanish Embassy in 1980 led to severe destruction and loss of life in the city. In May 2010 two disasters struck: the eruption of the Pacaya volcano, and two days later Tropical Storm Agatha.\n\n\n=== Contemporary history ===\n\nGuatemala City serves as the economic, governmental, and cultural epicenter of the nation of Guatemala. The city also functions as Guatemala's main transportation hub, hosting an international airport, La Aurora International Airport, and serving as the origination or end points for most of Guatemala's major highways. The city, with its robust economy, attracts hundreds of thousands of rural migrants from Guatemala's interior hinterlands and serves as the main entry point for most foreign immigrants seeking to settle in Guatemala.\nIn addition to a wide variety of restaurants, hotels, shops, and a modern BRT transport system (Transmetro), the city is home to many art galleries, theaters, sports venues and museums (including some fine collections of Pre-Columbian art) and provides a growing number of cultural offerings. Guatemala City not only possesses a history and culture unique to the Central American region, it also furnishes all the modern amenities of a world class city, ranging from an IMAX Theater to the \u00cdcaro film festival (Festival \u00cdcaro), where independent films produced in Guatemala and Central America are debuted.\n\n\n== Structure and growth ==\n\nGuatemala City is located in the mountainous highlands of the country, between the Pacific coastal plain to the south and the northern lowlands of the Peten region.\nThe city's metropolitan area has recently grown very rapidly and has absorbed most of the neighboring municipalities of Villa Nueva, San Miguel Petapa, Mixco, San Juan Sacatepequez, San Jos\u00e9 Pinula, Santa Catarina Pinula, Fraijanes, San Pedro Ayampuc, Amatitl\u00e1n, Villa Canales, Palencia and Chinautla forming what is now known as the Guatemala City Metropolitan Area.\nThe city is subdivided into 22 zones (\"Zonas\") designed by the urban engineering of Ra\u00fal Aguilar Batres, each one with its own streets (\"Calles\"). avenues (\"Avenidas\") and sometimes \"Diagonal\" Streets, making it pretty easy to find addresses in the city. Zones are numbered 1\u201325 with Zones 20, 22 and 23 not existing as they would have fallen in two other municipalities' territory. Addresses are assigned according to the street or avenue number, followed by a dash and the number of metres it is away from the intersection.For example, the INGUAT Office on \"7a Av. 1-17, Zona 4\" is a building which is located on Avenida 7, 17 meters away from the intersection with Calle 1, toward Calle 2 in zone 4.\n7a Av. 1-17, Zona 4; and 7a Av. 1-17, Zona 10, are two radically different addresses.\nShort streets/avenues do not get new sequenced number, for example, 6A Calle is a short street between 6a and 7a.\nSome \"avenidas\" or \"Calles\" have a name in addition to their number, if it is very wide, for example Avenida la Reforma is an avenue which separates Zone 9 and 10 and Calle Mont\u00fafar is Calle 12 in Zone 9.\nCalle 1 Avenida 1 Zona 1 is the center of every city in Guatemala.\nZone One is the Historic Center, (Centro Hist\u00f3rico), lying in the very heart of the city, the location of many important historic buildings including the Palacio Nacional de la Cultura (National Palace of Culture), the Metropolitan Cathedral, the National Congress, the Casa Presidencial (Presidential House), the National Library and Plaza de la Constituci\u00f3n (Constitution Plaza, old Central Park). Efforts to revitalize this important part of the city have been undertaken by the municipal government.\nBesides the parks, the city offers a portfolio of entertainment in the region, focused on the so-called Zona Viva and the Calzada Roosevelt as well as four degrees North. Casino activity is considerable, with several located in different parts of the Zona Viva. The area around the East market is being redeveloped.\nWithin the financial district are the tallest buildings in the country including: Club Premier, Tinttorento, Atlantis building, Atrium, Tikal Futura, Building of Finances, Towers Building Batteries, Torres Botticelli, Tadeus, building of the INTECAP, Royal Towers, Towers Geminis, Industrial Bank towers, Holiday Inn Hotel, Premier of the Americas, among many others to be used for offices, apartments etc. Also included are projects such as Zona Pradera and Interamerica's World Financial Center.\nOne of the most outstanding mayors was the engineer Martin Prado V\u00e9lez, who took over in 1949, and ruled the city during the reformist Presidents Juan Jos\u00e9 Ar\u00e9valo and Jacobo Arbenz Guzman, although he was not a member of the ruling party at the time and was elected due his well-known capabilities. Of cobanero origin, married with Marta Cobos, he studied at the University of San Carlos; under his tenure, among other modernist works of the city, infrastructure projects included El Incienso bridge, the construction of the Roosevelt Avenue, the main road axis from East to West of the city, the town hall building, and numerous road works which meant the widening of the colonial city, its order in the cardinal points and the generation of a ring road with the first cloverleaf interchange in the city.In an attempt to control the rapid growth of the city, the municipal government (Municipalidad de Guatemala) headed by longtime Mayor \u00c1lvaro Arz\u00fa, has implemented a plan to focus growth along important arterial roads and apply Transit-oriented development (TOD) characteristics. This plan denominated POT  (Plan de Ordenamiento Territorial) aims to allow taller building structures of mixed uses to be built next to large arterial roads and gradually decline in height and density moving away from such. It is also worth mentioning, that due to the airport being in the south of the city, height limits based on aeronautical considerations have been applied to the construction code. This limits the maximum height for a building, at 60 metres (200 feet) in Zone 10, up to 95 metres (312 feet) in Zone 1.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nDespite its location in the tropics, Guatemala City's relatively high altitude moderates average temperatures. The city has a tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen Aw) bordering on a subtropical highland climate (Cwb). Guatemala City is generally very warm, almost springlike, throughout the course of the year. It occasionally gets hot during the dry season, but not as hot and humid as in Central American cities at sea level. The hottest month is April. The rainy season extends from May to October, coinciding with the tropical storm and hurricane season in the western Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, while the dry season extends from November to April. The city can at times be windy, which also leads to lower ambient temperatures.\nThe average annual temperature ranges from 22 to 28 \u00b0C (71.6 to 82.4 \u00b0F) during the day, and 12 to 17 \u00b0C (53.6 to 62.6 \u00b0F) at night.\nAverage morning relative humidity: 82%, evening relative humidity: 58%.  Average dew point is 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Volcanic activity ===\nFour stratovolcanoes are visible from the city, two of them active. The nearest and most active is Pacaya, which at times erupts a considerable amount of ash. These volcanoes lie to the south of the Valle de la Ermita, providing a natural barrier between Guatemala City and the Pacific lowlands that define the southern regions of Guatemala. Agua, Fuego, Pacaya and Acatenango comprise a line of 33 stratovolcanoes that stretches across the breadth of Guatemala, from the Salvadorian border to the Mexican border.\n\n\n=== Earthquakes ===\n\nLying on the Ring of Fire, the Guatemalan highlands and the Valle de la Ermita are frequently shaken by large earthquakes.  The last large tremor to hit the Guatemala City region occurred in the 1976, on the Motagua Fault, a left-lateral strike-slip fault that forms the boundary between the Caribbean Plate and the North American Plate.  The 1976 event registered 7.5 on the moment magnitude scale.  Smaller, less severe tremors are frequently felt in Guatemala City and environs.\n\n\n=== Mudslides ===\nTorrential downpours, similar to the more famous monsoons, occur frequently in the Valle de la Ermita during the rainy season, leading to flash floods that sometimes inundate the city.  Due to these heavy rainfalls, some of the slums perched on the steep edges of the canyons that criss-cross the Valle de la Ermita are washed away and buried under mudslides, as in October 2005. Tropical waves, tropical storms and hurricanes sometimes strike the Guatemalan highlands, which also bring torrential rains to the Guatemala City region and trigger these deadly mudslides.\n\n\n=== Piping pseudokarst ===\n\nIn February 2007, a very large, deep circular hole with vertical walls opened in northeastern Guatemala City (14\u00b039\u20321.40\u2033N 90\u00b029\u203225\u2033W), killing five people. This sinkhole, which is classified by geologists as either a \"piping feature\" or \"piping pseudokarst\", was 100 metres (330 ft) deep, and apparently was created by fluid from a sewer eroding the loose volcanic ash, limestone, and other pyroclastic deposits that underlie Guatemala City. As a result, one thousand people were evacuated from the area.  This piping feature has since been mitigated by City Hall by providing proper maintenance to the sewerage collection system and plans to develop the site have been proposed. However, critics believe municipal authorities have neglected needed maintenance on the city's aging sewerage system, and have speculated that more dangerous piping features are likely to develop unless action is taken.3 years later the 2010 Guatemala City sinkhole arose.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIt is estimated that the population of Guatemala City proper is about 1 million, while its urban area is almost 3 million. The growth of the city's population has been robust since then, abetted by the mass migration of Guatemalans from the rural hinterlands to the largest and most vibrant regional economy in Guatemala.  The inhabitants of Guatemala City are incredibly diverse given the size of the city, with those of Spanish and Mestizo descent being the most numerous. Guatemala City also has sizable indigenous populations, divided among the 23 distinct Mayan groups present in Guatemala.  The numerous Mayan languages are now spoken in certain quarters of Guatemala City, making the city a linguistically rich area.  Foreigners and foreign immigrants comprise the final distinct group of Guatemala City inhabitants, representing a very small minority among the city's citizens.Due to mass migration from impoverished rural districts wracked with political instability, Guatemala City's population has exploded since the 1970s, severely straining the existing bureaucratic and physical infrastructure of the city. As a result, chronic traffic congestion, shortages of safe potable water in some areas of the city, and a sudden and prolonged surge in crime have become perennial problems. The infrastructure, although continuing to grow and improve in some areas, it is lagging in relation to the increasing population of those less fortunate. Guatemala City is not unique in facing and tackling problems all too common among rapidly expanding cities around the world.\n\n\n== Communications ==\nGuatemala City is headquarters to many communications and telecom companies, among them Tigo, Claro-Telgua, and Movistar-Telef\u00f3nica. These companies also offer cable television, internet services and telephone access. Due to Guatemala City's large and concentrated consumer base in comparison to the rest of the country, these telecom and communications companies provide most of their services and offerings within the confines of the city.  There are also seven local television channels, in addition to numerous international channels.  The international channels range from children's programming, like Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel, to more adult offerings, such as E! and HBO.  While international programming is dominated by entertainment from the United States, domestic programming is dominated by shows from Mexico.  Due to its small and relatively income-restricted domestic market, Guatemala City produces very little in the way of its own programming outside of local news and sports.\n\n\n== Economy and Finance ==\nGuatemala City, as the capital, is home to Guatemala's central bank, from which Guatemala's monetary and fiscal policies are formulated and promulgated.  Guatemala City is also headquarters to numerous regional private banks, among them CitiBank, Banco Agromercantil, Banco Promerica, Banco Industrial, Banco GyT Continental, Banco de Antigua, Banco Reformador, Banrural, Grupo Financiero de Occidente, BAC Credomatic, and Banco Internacional.  By far the richest and most powerful regional economy within Guatemala, Guatemala City is the largest market for goods and services, which provides the greatest number of investment opportunities for public and private investors in all of Guatemala.  Financing for these investments is provided by the regional private banks, as well as by foreign direct and capital investment, mostly from the United States.  Guatemala City's ample consumer base and sophisticated service sector is represented by the large department store chains present in the city, among them Siman, Hiper Paiz & Paiz (Walmart), Price Smart, ClubCo, Cemaco, Sears and Office Depot.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Places of interest by zones ==\nGuatemala City is divided into 22 zones in accordance with the urban layout plan designed by Ra\u00fal Aguilar Batres.  Each zone has its own streets and avenues, facilitating navigation within the city. Zones are numbered 1 through 25.  However, numbers 20, 22 and 23 have not been designated to zones, thus these zones do not exist within the city proper.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nRenovated and expanded, La Aurora International Airport lies to the south of the city center.  La Aurora serves as Guatemala's principal air hub.\nPublic transport is provided by buses and supplemented by a BRT system. The three main highways that bisect and serve Guatemala start in the city. (CA9 Transoceanic Highway - Puerto San Jose to Puerto Santo Tomas de Castilla-, CA1 Panamerican Highway - from the Mexican border to Salvadorian border - and to Peten.)  Construction of freeways and underpasses by the municipal government, the implementation of reversible lanes during peak rush-hour traffic, as well as the establishment of the Department of Metropolitan Transit Police (PMT), has helped improve traffic flow in the city.  Despite these municipal efforts, the Guatemala City metropolitan area still faces growing traffic congestion.\nA BRT (bus rapid transit) system called Transmetro, consisting of special-purpose lanes for high-capacity buses, began operating in 2007, and aimed to improve traffic flow in the city through the implementation of an efficient mass transit system. The system consists of five lines. It is expected to be expanded around 10 lines, with some over-capacity expected lines being considered for Light Metro or Heavy Metro.Traditional buses are now required to discharge passengers at transfer stations at the city's edge to board the Transmetro. This is being implemented as new Transmetro lines become established. In conjunction with the new mass transit implementation in the city, there is also a prepaid bus card system called Transurbano that is being implemented in the metro area to limit cash handling for the transportation system. A new fleet of buses tailored for this system has been purchased from a Brazilian firm.\nA light rail line known as Metro Riel is proposed.\n\n\n== Universities and schools ==\n\nGuatemala City is home to ten universities, among them the oldest institution of higher education in Central America, the University of San Carlos of Guatemala.  Founded in 1676, the Universidad de San Carlos is older than all North American universities except for Harvard University.\nThe other nine institutions of higher education to be found in Guatemala City include the Universidad Mariano G\u00e1lvez, the Universidad Panamericana, the Universidad Mesoamericana, the Universidad Rafael Landivar, the Universidad Francisco Marroqu\u00edn, the Universidad del Valle, the Universidad del Istmo, Universidad Galileo, Universidad da Vinci and the Universidad Rural.  Whereas these nine named universities are private, the Universidad de San Carlos remains the only public institution of higher learning.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nGuatemala City possesses several sportsgrounds and is home to many sports clubs. Football is the most popular sport, with CSD Municipal, Aurora F.C. and Comunicaciones being the main clubs. The Estadio Mateo Flores, located in the Zone 5 of the city, is the largest stadium in the country, followed in capacity by the Estadio Cementos Progreso, Estadio del Ej\u00e9rcito & Estadio El Tr\u00e9bol. An important multi-functional hall is the Domo Polideportivo de la CDAG.\nThe city has hosted several promotional functions and some international sports events: in 1950 it hosted the VI Central American and Caribbean Games, and in 2000 the FIFA Futsal World Championship. On 4 July 2007 the International Olympic Committee gathered in Guatemala City and voted Sochi to become the host for the 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics.  In April 2010, it hosted the XIVth Pan-American Mountain Bike Championships.Guatemala City hosted the 2008 edition of the CONCACAF Futsal Championship, played at the Domo Polideportivo from 2 to 8 June 2008.\n\n\n== Panoramic views of Guatemala City ==\n\n\n=== 1875 ===\n\n\n=== 2008 ===\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== International organizations with headquarters in Guatemala City ===\nCentral American Parliament\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2014 sister cities ===\nGuatemala City is twinned with:\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n Guatemala portal\n Geography portal\n2007 Guatemala earthquake\nLa Aurora International Airport\nList of places in Guatemala\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

      "name": "Caracas Cathedral",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Caracas Cathedral or Metropolitan Cathedral of Saint Anne is the seat of the Roman Catholic  Metropolitan archdiocese of Caracas, located on the Plaza Bol\u00edvar in Caracas, Venezuela. Its chapel of the Holy Trinity is the burial site of the parents and wife of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar. The Nuestra Senora de Venezuela y Santa Ana is a square (cuadra) situated between the cathedral and the central plaza, which is walled on three sides, but open to the east where it faces the cathedral.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe church originally built at this location in the mid-17th century was a mud-walled chapel and dedicated to St. James (Santiago). It was destroyed during the earthquake of 1641. The building has undergone rebuilding, restoration, or expansion on numerous occasions since. The first construction of the cathedral replacing the small church commenced in 1666 under Juan de Medina, and a bell tower was added. Construction was completed in 1674. The fa\u00e7ade, dating from 1771, is the work of Francisco Andr\u00e9s de Meneses. The building was again damaged in the earthquakes of 1766 and 1812. At 4 pm on Holy Thursday, 26 March 1812, an earthquake measuring 7.7 magnitude on the Richter scale struck Caracas. Worshippers had assembled in large numbers at the church when the earthquake struck. The cathedral crumbled, killing a few people and injuring many. The priests explained it as divine retribution for Francisco de Miranda's rebellion and the devout parishioners agreed with them even though Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar told the people not to panic as it was merely an earthquake.After the earthquake, one of its towers was damaged and later reduced in size. A frontispiece was constructed in the facade in 1866. The cathedral houses crypt chambers, the most notable of which is the Bol\u00edvars', as his parents and young bride are entombed here. Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar's remains were also entombed here from 1842 until 1876 when they were solemnly transferred to the Pante\u00f3n Nacional, five blocks to the north.  In 1932 and during the 1960s, restoration and modifications were made throughout the building. Juan Bautista Plaza served as the chapel master and organist until 1948. In 1974, the cathedral parish's marriage registry for the period 1615\u20131831 was published by the Instituto Venezolano de Genealogia.\n\n\n== Architecture and fittings ==\n\nThe structure is built from stone with a tile roof. Supported by 24 unadorned pillars, it measures 270 by 81 feet (82 m \u00d7 25 m). In 1812, it was noted that the brick steeple held the city's only public clock at the time.The Romanesque plan consists of five naves: a central one and two minor ones on each side which makes the interior look wide. The central nave is separated from the lateral ones by 32 octagonal columns with composite capitals, supporting round arches; the columns were refurbished in the late 19th century. The main altar and altarpiece are inside the presbytery, located at the end of the central nave. The altars are gilded  and the side chapels are elaborate in appearance. The prominent altar in the cathedral is of the Bol\u00edvar family which is prominently located at the centre, on the right aisle, which has a modern sculpture of Simon Bol\u00edvar titled \u201cEl Libertador\u201d (The Liberator). There is also a colourful altar at the backyard of the cathedral.The cathedral's organ was built in 1711 by the French immigrant, Claudio Febres. One of the baptismal fonts, which had been located at the cathedral and was used to baptize Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the liberator of Venezuela, is now located in the courtyard at the home of this birth. The sacral art in the cathedral contains among others The Resurrection by Rubens, the Presentation of the Virgin by Murillo, and the Last Supper, an unfinished work by the Venezuelan painter Arturo Michelena.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nNotable figures in the cathedral's history include the isle\u00f1o Manuel de Sosa Betancourt, who was its archdeacon. Carlos Herrera Mesones (1705\u20131761) was a canon and the cathedral's treasurer. Ambrosio de Carreno (1721\u2013c.1801) served as the maestro di capilla during the period of 1750 through 1774. Before his 1789 ordination, Jose de la Luz Urbano (1755\u20131810) served as the cathedral's organist. Jos\u00e9 Cayetano Carre\u00f1o (1774\u20131836) was the cathedral's organist from the age of 15 until his death. In 1796, Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Lamas was appointed first bassoon in the cathedral's orchestra, and his most famous piece, Popule Meus premiered in the cathedral in 1801. Pedro Palacios y Sojo (1739\u20131799), cleric and composer, became prelate of the cathedral in 1798.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nRaub, Kevin; Kluepfel, Brian; Masters, Tom; Lonely Planet (2010).

        "wiki": "Caracas (, Spanish: [ka\u02c8\u027eakas]), officially Santiago de Le\u00f3n de Caracas, abbreviated as CCS, is the capital and largest city of Venezuela, and the center of the Metropolitan Region of Caracas (or Greater Caracas). Caracas is located along the Guaire River in the northern part of the country, within the Caracas Valley of the Venezuelan coastal mountain range (Cordillera de la Costa). The valley is close to the Caribbean Sea, separated from the coast by a steep 2,200-metre-high (7,200 ft) mountain range, Cerro El \u00c1vila; to the south there are more hills and mountains. The Metropolitan Region of Caracas has an estimated population of almost 5 million inhabitants.\nThe center of the city is still Catedral, located near Bol\u00edvar Square, though some consider the center to be Plaza Venezuela, located in the Los Caobos area. Businesses in the city include service companies, banks, and malls. Caracas has a largely service-based economy, apart from some industrial activity in its metropolitan area. The Caracas Stock Exchange and Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA) are headquartered in Caracas. PDVSA is the largest company in Venezuela. Caracas is also Venezuela's cultural capital, with many restaurants, theaters, museums, and shopping centers. Caracas has some of the tallest skyscrapers in Latin America, such as the Parque Central Towers. The Museum of Contemporary Art of Caracas is one of the most important in South America.Caracas has one of the highest per capita murder rates in the world, with 111.19 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBefore the city was founded in 1567, the valley of Caracas was populated by indigenous peoples. Francisco Fajardo, the son of a Spanish captain and a Guaiqueri cacica, who came from Margarita, began establishing settlements in the area of La Guaira and the Caracas valley between 1555 and 1560. Fajardo attempted to establish a plantation in the valley in 1562 after these unsuccessful coastal towns, but it did not last long: it was destroyed by natives of the region led by Terepaima and Guaicaipuro. Fajardo's 1560 settlement was known as Hato de San Francisco, and another attempt in 1561 by Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Su\u00e1rez was called Villa de San Francisco, and was also destroyed by the same native people. The eventual settlers of Caracas came from Coro, the German capital of their Klein-Venedig colony around the present-day coastal Colombia\u2013Venezuela border; from the 1540s, the colony had been de facto controlled by Spaniards. Moving eastward from Coro, groups of Spanish settlers founded inland towns including Barquisimeto and Valencia before reaching the Caracas valley.On 25 July 1567, Captain Diego de Losada laid the foundations of the city of Santiago de Le\u00f3n de Caracas. De Losada had been commissioned to capture the valley, and was successful by splitting the natives into different groups to work with, then fighting and defeating each of them. The town was the closest to the coast of these new settlements, and the colonists retained a native workforce, which allowed a trade network to develop between Caracas, the interior, and Margarita; the towns further inland produced ample cotton products and beeswax, and Margarita was a rich source of pearls. The Caracas valley had a good environment for both agricultural and arable farming, which contributed to the system of commerce but meant that the town's population was initially sparse, as it was only large enough to support a few farms.In 1577, Caracas became the capital of the Spanish Empire's Venezuela Province under the province's new governor, Juan de Pimentel (1576\u20131583). In the 1580s, Caraque\u00f1os started selling food to the Spanish soldiers in Cartagena, who often docked in the coastal city when collecting products from the empire in South America. Wheat was growing increasingly expensive in the Iberian Peninsula, and the Spanish profited from buying it from Caracas farmers. This cemented the city in the empire's trade circuit.During the 16th and 17th centuries, the coast of Venezuela was frequently raided by pirates. With the coastal mountains of the Central Range as a barrier, Caracas was relatively immune to such attacks, compared to other Caribbean coastal settlements, but in 1595 the Preston\u2013Somers expedition landed and around 200 English Privateers, including George Somers and Amyas Preston, crossed the mountains through a little-used pass while the town's defenders were guarding the more frequently used one. Encountering little resistance, the invaders sacked and set fire to the town after a failed ransom negotiation. The city managed to rebuild, using wheat profits and \"a lot of sacrifice\". In the 1620s, farmers in Caracas discovered that Cacao beans could be sold, first selling them to native people of Mexico and quickly growing across the Caribbean. The city became important in the Viceroyalty of New Spain, as well as moving from largely native slave labor to African slaves, the first of the Spanish colonies to become part of the slave trade. The city was successful and operated on cacao and slave trade until the 1650s, when an alhorra blight, the Mexican Inquisition of many of their Portuguese traders, and increased cacao production in Guayaquil greatly affected the market. This and the destructive 1641 earthquake put the city into decline, and they likely began illegally trading with the Dutch Empire, which Caraque\u00f1os later proved sympathetic to; by the 1670s, Caracas had a trading route through Cura\u00e7ao.In 1728, the Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas was founded by the king, and the cacao business grew in importance. Caracas was made one of the three provinces of Nueva Granada, corresponding to Venezuela, in 1739. Over the next three decades the Viceroyalty was variously split, with Caracas province becoming the Venezuela province and then the Captaincy General of Venezuela in 1777, with Caracas as the capital. Venezuela then attempted to become independent, first with the 1797 Gual and Espa\u00f1a conspiracy, based in Caracas, and then the successful 1811 Venezuelan Declaration of Independence. Caracas then came under worse luck: in 1812, an earthquake destroyed Caracas, a quarter of its population migrated in 1814, and the Venezuelan War of Independence continued until 24 June 1821, when Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar defeated royalists in the Battle of Carabobo. Urban reforms only took place towards the end of the 19th century, under Antonio Guzm\u00e1n Blanco: some landmarks were built, but the city remained distinctly colonial until the 1930s.\n\nCaracas grew in size, population, and economic importance during Venezuela's oil boom in the early 20th century. In the 1950s, the metropolitan area of Gran Caracas was developed, and the city began an intensive modernization program, funding public buildings, which continued throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. Cultural landmarks, like the University City of Caracas, designed by modernist architect Carlos Ra\u00fal Villanueva and declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2000; the Caracas Museum of Contemporary Art; and the Teresa Carre\u00f1o Cultural Complex were built, as well as the Caracas Metro and a developed downtown area. Urban development was rapid, leading to the growth of slums on the hillsides surrounding the new city. Much of the city development also fell into disrepair come the end of the 20th century, with the 1980s oil glut and political instability like the Caracazo, meaning maintenance can not be sustained. The economic and social problems persist throughout the capital and country, characterized as the Crisis in Venezuela. Caracas is the most violent city in the world.\n\n\n== Coat of arms ==\nThe coat of arms was adopted in 1591. Sim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar, an ancestor of Venezuelan liberator Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, had been named the first procurator general of the Venezuelan province in 1589. He served as the representative of Venezuela to the Spanish Crown, and vice versa. In 1591, de Bol\u00edvar introduced a petition to King Philip II for a coat of arms, which he granted by Royal Cedula on 4 September that year in San Lorenzo. The coat of arms represents the city's name with the red Santiago (St. James') cross. It originally depicted \"a brown bear rampant on a field of silver, holding between its paws a golden shell with the red cross of Santiago; and its seal is a crown with five golden points\". In the same act, the king declared Caracas as \"The Most Noble and Very Loyal City of Santiago de Le\u00f3n de Caracas\".The anthem of the city is the Marcha a Caracas, written by the composer Tiero Pezzuti de Matteis with the lyrics by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Sarabia and approved in 1984.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nCaracas is contained entirely within a valley of the Venezuelan Central Range, and is separated from the Caribbean coast by a roughly 15-kilometre (9 mi) expanse of El \u00c1vila National Park. The valley is relatively small and quite irregular, and the altitude varies from between 870 and 1,043 meters (2,854 and 3,422 ft) above sea level; the historic center lies at about 900 meters (3,000 feet) above sea level. This, along with the rapid population growth, has profoundly influenced the urban development of the city. The most elevated point of the Capital District, wherein the city is located, is the Pico El \u00c1vila, which rises to 2,159 meters (7,083 feet).The main body of water in Caracas is the Guaire River, which flows across the city and empties into the Tuy River, which is also fed by the El Valle and San Pedro rivers, in addition to numerous streams which descend from El \u00c1vila. The La Mariposa and Camatagua reservoirs provide water to the city. The city is occasionally subject to earthquakes \u2013 notably in 1641 and 1967.\nGeologically, Caracas was formed in the Late Cretaceous period, with much of the rest of the Caribbean, and sits on what is mostly metamorphic rock. Deformation of the land in this period formed the region.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Caracas has a mix of tropical savanna climate (Aw) with subtropical highland (Cwb) influences due to its altitude. Caracas is also intertropical, with precipitation that varies between 900 and 1,300 millimeters (35 and 51 inches) (annual), in the city proper, and up to 2,000 millimeters (79 inches) in some parts of the Mountain range. While Caracas is within the tropics, due to its altitude temperatures are generally not nearly as high as other tropical locations at sea level. The annual average temperature is approximately 23.8 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F), with the average of the coldest month (January) 22.8 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) and the average of the warmest month (July) 25.0 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F), which gives a small annual thermal amplitude of 2.2 \u00b0C (4.0 \u00b0F).In the months of December and January abundant fog may appear, in addition to a sudden nightly drop in temperature, until reaching 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F). This peculiar weather is known by the natives of Caracas as the Pacheco. In addition, nightly temperatures at any time of the year are much (14 to 20 \u00b0C) lower than daytime highs and usually do not remain above 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F), resulting in very pleasant evening temperatures. Hail storms appear in Caracas, although only on rare occasions. Electrical storms are much more frequent, especially between June and October, due to the city being in a closed valley and the orographic action of Cerro El \u00c1vila.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAccording to the population census of 2011 the Caracas proper (Distrito Capital) is over 1.9 million inhabitants, while that of the Metropolitan District of Caracas is estimated at 2.9 million as of 2011. The majority of the population is mixed-race, typically with varying degrees of European, African, Indigenous and occasional Asian ancestry. There is a noteworthy Afro-Venezuelan community. Additionally, the city has a large number of both European Venezuelans and Asian Venezuelans who descend from the massive influx of various immigrants Venezuela received from all across Eurasia during the 20th century; in particular are descendants of Spaniards, Portuguese, Italians, Chinese, Colombians, Germans, Syrians and Lebanese people. In 2020, the poorest 55% of the Caracas population lived on about a third of its land, in poorly-planned slums that are generally dangerous to live in and access.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\n\nVenezuela and its capital, Caracas, are reported to both have among the highest per capita murder rates in the world. Caracas is the city with the highest homicide rate in the world outside of a warzone, with a 2016 rate of around 120 murders per 100,000 people. Most murders and other violent crimes go unsolved, with estimates of the number of unresolved crimes as high as 98%. The U.S. Department of State and British Foreign and Commonwealth Office have issued travel warnings for Venezuela (especially Caracas) due to high rates of crime.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nBusinesses that are located in Caracas include service companies, banks, and malls, among others. It has a largely service-based economy, apart from some industrial activity in its metropolitan area. The Caracas Stock Exchange and Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA) are headquartered here. PDVSA, a state-run organization, is the largest company in Venezuela, and negotiates all the international agreements for the distribution and export of petroleum. When it existed, the airline Viasa had its headquarters in the Torre Viasa.Several international companies and embassies are located in El Rosal and Las Mercedes, in the Caracas area. The city also serves as a hub for communication and transportation infrastructure between the metropolitan area and the rest of the country. Important industries in Caracas include chemicals, textiles, leather, food, iron, and wood products. There are also rubber and cement factories. Its nominal GDP is US$70 billion and the GDP (PPP) per capita is US$24,000.A 2009 United Nations survey reported that the cost of living in Caracas was 89% of that of the survey's baseline city, New York. However, this statistic is based upon a fixed currency-exchange-rate of 2003 and might not be completely realistic, due to the elevated inflation rates of the last several years.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nIn 2013, the World Economic Forum evaluated countries in terms of how successful they were in advertising campaigns to attract foreign visitors. Out of the 140 countries evaluated, Venezuela came last. A major factor that has contributed to the lack of foreign visitors has been poor transport for tourists. Venezuela has limited railway systems and airlines. High crime rates and the negative attitude of the Venezuelan population towards tourism also contributed to the poor evaluation.In an attempt to attract more foreign visitors, the Venezuelan Ministry of Tourism invested in multiple hotel infrastructures. The largest hotel investment has been in the Hotel Alba Caracas. The cost for the general maintenance of the north and south towers of the hotel is approximately 231.5 million Venezuelan bolivars. Although the Venezuelan Ministry of Tourism has taken the initiative to recognize the importance of the tourism industry, the Venezuelan government has not placed the tourism industry as an economic priority. In 2013, the budget for the Ministry of Tourism was only 173.8 million bolivars, while the Ministry of the Youth received approximately 724.6 million bolivars. The tourism industry in Venezuela contributes approximately 3.8 percent of the country GDP. The World Economic Forum predicts Venezuela's GDP to rise to 4.2 percent by 2022.\n\n\n== Government ==\nOn 8 March 2000, the year after a new constitution was introduced in Venezuela, it was decreed in Gaceta Official N\u00b0 36,906 that the Metropolitan District of Caracas would be created and that some of the powers of the Libertador, Chacao, Baruta, Sucre, and El Hatillo municipalities would be delegated to the Alcald\u00eda Mayor, physically located in the large Libertador municipality, in the center of the city. The Metropolitan District of Caracas was suppressed on 20 December 2017 by the Constituent National Assembly of Venezuela.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCaracas is Venezuela's cultural capital, with many restaurants, theaters, museums, and shopping centers.

Baseball teams Tiburones de La Guaira and Leones del Caracas play at University Stadium, with a capacity of nearly 26,000 spectators.The football stadiums in the city include the Olympic Stadium, home to Caracas F\u00fatbol Club and Deportivo La Guaira, with a capacity of 30,000 spectators, and the Br\u00edgido Iriarte Stadium, home to Atl\u00e9tico Venezuela, with a capacity of 12,000 spectators. In basketball, the Cocodrilos de Caracas play their games in the Poliedro de Caracas in the El Para\u00edso neighborhood.Caracas is the seat of the National Institute of Sports and of the Venezuelan Olympic Committee.

        "wiki": "Caracas (, Spanish: [ka\u02c8\u027eakas]), officially Santiago de Le\u00f3n de Caracas, abbreviated as CCS, is the capital and largest city of Venezuela, and the center of the Metropolitan Region of Caracas (or Greater Caracas). Caracas is located along the Guaire River in the northern part of the country, within the Caracas Valley of the Venezuelan coastal mountain range (Cordillera de la Costa). The valley is close to the Caribbean Sea, separated from the coast by a steep 2,200-metre-high (7,200 ft) mountain range, Cerro El \u00c1vila; to the south there are more hills and mountains. The Metropolitan Region of Caracas has an estimated population of almost 5 million inhabitants.\nThe center of the city is still Catedral, located near Bol\u00edvar Square, though some consider the center to be Plaza Venezuela, located in the Los Caobos area. Businesses in the city include service companies, banks, and malls. Caracas has a largely service-based economy, apart from some industrial activity in its metropolitan area. The Caracas Stock Exchange and Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA) are headquartered in Caracas. PDVSA is the largest company in Venezuela. Caracas is also Venezuela's cultural capital, with many restaurants, theaters, museums, and shopping centers. Caracas has some of the tallest skyscrapers in Latin America, such as the Parque Central Towers. The Museum of Contemporary Art of Caracas is one of the most important in South America.Caracas has one of the highest per capita murder rates in the world, with 111.19 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBefore the city was founded in 1567, the valley of Caracas was populated by indigenous peoples. Francisco Fajardo, the son of a Spanish captain and a Guaiqueri cacica, who came from Margarita, began establishing settlements in the area of La Guaira and the Caracas valley between 1555 and 1560. Fajardo attempted to establish a plantation in the valley in 1562 after these unsuccessful coastal towns, but it did not last long: it was destroyed by natives of the region led by Terepaima and Guaicaipuro. Fajardo's 1560 settlement was known as Hato de San Francisco, and another attempt in 1561 by Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Su\u00e1rez was called Villa de San Francisco, and was also destroyed by the same native people. The eventual settlers of Caracas came from Coro, the German capital of their Klein-Venedig colony around the present-day coastal Colombia\u2013Venezuela border; from the 1540s, the colony had been de facto controlled by Spaniards. Moving eastward from Coro, groups of Spanish settlers founded inland towns including Barquisimeto and Valencia before reaching the Caracas valley.On 25 July 1567, Captain Diego de Losada laid the foundations of the city of Santiago de Le\u00f3n de Caracas. De Losada had been commissioned to capture the valley, and was successful by splitting the natives into different groups to work with, then fighting and defeating each of them. The town was the closest to the coast of these new settlements, and the colonists retained a native workforce, which allowed a trade network to develop between Caracas, the interior, and Margarita; the towns further inland produced ample cotton products and beeswax, and Margarita was a rich source of pearls. The Caracas valley had a good environment for both agricultural and arable farming, which contributed to the system of commerce but meant that the town's population was initially sparse, as it was only large enough to support a few farms.In 1577, Caracas became the capital of the Spanish Empire's Venezuela Province under the province's new governor, Juan de Pimentel (1576\u20131583). In the 1580s, Caraque\u00f1os started selling food to the Spanish soldiers in Cartagena, who often docked in the coastal city when collecting products from the empire in South America. Wheat was growing increasingly expensive in the Iberian Peninsula, and the Spanish profited from buying it from Caracas farmers. This cemented the city in the empire's trade circuit.During the 16th and 17th centuries, the coast of Venezuela was frequently raided by pirates. With the coastal mountains of the Central Range as a barrier, Caracas was relatively immune to such attacks, compared to other Caribbean coastal settlements, but in 1595 the Preston\u2013Somers expedition landed and around 200 English Privateers, including George Somers and Amyas Preston, crossed the mountains through a little-used pass while the town's defenders were guarding the more frequently used one. Encountering little resistance, the invaders sacked and set fire to the town after a failed ransom negotiation. The city managed to rebuild, using wheat profits and \"a lot of sacrifice\". In the 1620s, farmers in Caracas discovered that Cacao beans could be sold, first selling them to native people of Mexico and quickly growing across the Caribbean. The city became important in the Viceroyalty of New Spain, as well as moving from largely native slave labor to African slaves, the first of the Spanish colonies to become part of the slave trade. The city was successful and operated on cacao and slave trade until the 1650s, when an alhorra blight, the Mexican Inquisition of many of their Portuguese traders, and increased cacao production in Guayaquil greatly affected the market. This and the destructive 1641 earthquake put the city into decline, and they likely began illegally trading with the Dutch Empire, which Caraque\u00f1os later proved sympathetic to; by the 1670s, Caracas had a trading route through Cura\u00e7ao.In 1728, the Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas was founded by the king, and the cacao business grew in importance. Caracas was made one of the three provinces of Nueva Granada, corresponding to Venezuela, in 1739. Over the next three decades the Viceroyalty was variously split, with Caracas province becoming the Venezuela province and then the Captaincy General of Venezuela in 1777, with Caracas as the capital. Venezuela then attempted to become independent, first with the 1797 Gual and Espa\u00f1a conspiracy, based in Caracas, and then the successful 1811 Venezuelan Declaration of Independence. Caracas then came under worse luck: in 1812, an earthquake destroyed Caracas, a quarter of its population migrated in 1814, and the Venezuelan War of Independence continued until 24 June 1821, when Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar defeated royalists in the Battle of Carabobo. Urban reforms only took place towards the end of the 19th century, under Antonio Guzm\u00e1n Blanco: some landmarks were built, but the city remained distinctly colonial until the 1930s.\n\nCaracas grew in size, population, and economic importance during Venezuela's oil boom in the early 20th century. In the 1950s, the metropolitan area of Gran Caracas was developed, and the city began an intensive modernization program, funding public buildings, which continued throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. Cultural landmarks, like the University City of Caracas, designed by modernist architect Carlos Ra\u00fal Villanueva and declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2000; the Caracas Museum of Contemporary Art; and the Teresa Carre\u00f1o Cultural Complex were built, as well as the Caracas Metro and a developed downtown area. Urban development was rapid, leading to the growth of slums on the hillsides surrounding the new city. Much of the city development also fell into disrepair come the end of the 20th century, with the 1980s oil glut and political instability like the Caracazo, meaning maintenance can not be sustained. The economic and social problems persist throughout the capital and country, characterized as the Crisis in Venezuela. Caracas is the most violent city in the world.\n\n\n== Coat of arms ==\nThe coat of arms was adopted in 1591. Sim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar, an ancestor of Venezuelan liberator Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, had been named the first procurator general of the Venezuelan province in 1589. He served as the representative of Venezuela to the Spanish Crown, and vice versa. In 1591, de Bol\u00edvar introduced a petition to King Philip II for a coat of arms, which he granted by Royal Cedula on 4 September that year in San Lorenzo. The coat of arms represents the city's name with the red Santiago (St. James') cross. It originally depicted \"a brown bear rampant on a field of silver, holding between its paws a golden shell with the red cross of Santiago; and its seal is a crown with five golden points\". In the same act, the king declared Caracas as \"The Most Noble and Very Loyal City of Santiago de Le\u00f3n de Caracas\".The anthem of the city is the Marcha a Caracas, written by the composer Tiero Pezzuti de Matteis with the lyrics by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Sarabia and approved in 1984.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nCaracas is contained entirely within a valley of the Venezuelan Central Range, and is separated from the Caribbean coast by a roughly 15-kilometre (9 mi) expanse of El \u00c1vila National Park. The valley is relatively small and quite irregular, and the altitude varies from between 870 and 1,043 meters (2,854 and 3,422 ft) above sea level; the historic center lies at about 900 meters (3,000 feet) above sea level. This, along with the rapid population growth, has profoundly influenced the urban development of the city. The most elevated point of the Capital District, wherein the city is located, is the Pico El \u00c1vila, which rises to 2,159 meters (7,083 feet).The main body of water in Caracas is the Guaire River, which flows across the city and empties into the Tuy River, which is also fed by the El Valle and San Pedro rivers, in addition to numerous streams which descend from El \u00c1vila. The La Mariposa and Camatagua reservoirs provide water to the city. The city is occasionally subject to earthquakes \u2013 notably in 1641 and 1967.\nGeologically, Caracas was formed in the Late Cretaceous period, with much of the rest of the Caribbean, and sits on what is mostly metamorphic rock. Deformation of the land in this period formed the region.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Caracas has a mix of tropical savanna climate (Aw) with subtropical highland (Cwb) influences due to its altitude. Caracas is also intertropical, with precipitation that varies between 900 and 1,300 millimeters (35 and 51 inches) (annual), in the city proper, and up to 2,000 millimeters (79 inches) in some parts of the Mountain range. While Caracas is within the tropics, due to its altitude temperatures are generally not nearly as high as other tropical locations at sea level. The annual average temperature is approximately 23.8 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F), with the average of the coldest month (January) 22.8 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) and the average of the warmest month (July) 25.0 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F), which gives a small annual thermal amplitude of 2.2 \u00b0C (4.0 \u00b0F).In the months of December and January abundant fog may appear, in addition to a sudden nightly drop in temperature, until reaching 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F). This peculiar weather is known by the natives of Caracas as the Pacheco. In addition, nightly temperatures at any time of the year are much (14 to 20 \u00b0C) lower than daytime highs and usually do not remain above 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F), resulting in very pleasant evening temperatures. Hail storms appear in Caracas, although only on rare occasions. Electrical storms are much more frequent, especially between June and October, due to the city being in a closed valley and the orographic action of Cerro El \u00c1vila.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAccording to the population census of 2011 the Caracas proper (Distrito Capital) is over 1.9 million inhabitants, while that of the Metropolitan District of Caracas is estimated at 2.9 million as of 2011. The majority of the population is mixed-race, typically with varying degrees of European, African, Indigenous and occasional Asian ancestry. There is a noteworthy Afro-Venezuelan community. Additionally, the city has a large number of both European Venezuelans and Asian Venezuelans who descend from the massive influx of various immigrants Venezuela received from all across Eurasia during the 20th century; in particular are descendants of Spaniards, Portuguese, Italians, Chinese, Colombians, Germans, Syrians and Lebanese people. In 2020, the poorest 55% of the Caracas population lived on about a third of its land, in poorly-planned slums that are generally dangerous to live in and access.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\n\nVenezuela and its capital, Caracas, are reported to both have among the highest per capita murder rates in the world. Caracas is the city with the highest homicide rate in the world outside of a warzone, with a 2016 rate of around 120 murders per 100,000 people. Most murders and other violent crimes go unsolved, with estimates of the number of unresolved crimes as high as 98%. The U.S. Department of State and British Foreign and Commonwealth Office have issued travel warnings for Venezuela (especially Caracas) due to high rates of crime.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nBusinesses that are located in Caracas include service companies, banks, and malls, among others. It has a largely service-based economy, apart from some industrial activity in its metropolitan area. The Caracas Stock Exchange and Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA) are headquartered here. PDVSA, a state-run organization, is the largest company in Venezuela, and negotiates all the international agreements for the distribution and export of petroleum. When it existed, the airline Viasa had its headquarters in the Torre Viasa.Several international companies and embassies are located in El Rosal and Las Mercedes, in the Caracas area. The city also serves as a hub for communication and transportation infrastructure between the metropolitan area and the rest of the country. Important industries in Caracas include chemicals, textiles, leather, food, iron, and wood products. There are also rubber and cement factories. Its nominal GDP is US$70 billion and the GDP (PPP) per capita is US$24,000.A 2009 United Nations survey reported that the cost of living in Caracas was 89% of that of the survey's baseline city, New York. However, this statistic is based upon a fixed currency-exchange-rate of 2003 and might not be completely realistic, due to the elevated inflation rates of the last several years.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nIn 2013, the World Economic Forum evaluated countries in terms of how successful they were in advertising campaigns to attract foreign visitors. Out of the 140 countries evaluated, Venezuela came last. A major factor that has contributed to the lack of foreign visitors has been poor transport for tourists. Venezuela has limited railway systems and airlines. High crime rates and the negative attitude of the Venezuelan population towards tourism also contributed to the poor evaluation.In an attempt to attract more foreign visitors, the Venezuelan Ministry of Tourism invested in multiple hotel infrastructures. The largest hotel investment has been in the Hotel Alba Caracas. The cost for the general maintenance of the north and south towers of the hotel is approximately 231.5 million Venezuelan bolivars. Although the Venezuelan Ministry of Tourism has taken the initiative to recognize the importance of the tourism industry, the Venezuelan government has not placed the tourism industry as an economic priority. In 2013, the budget for the Ministry of Tourism was only 173.8 million bolivars, while the Ministry of the Youth received approximately 724.6 million bolivars. The tourism industry in Venezuela contributes approximately 3.8 percent of the country GDP. The World Economic Forum predicts Venezuela's GDP to rise to 4.2 percent by 2022.\n\n\n== Government ==\nOn 8 March 2000, the year after a new constitution was introduced in Venezuela, it was decreed in Gaceta Official N\u00b0 36,906 that the Metropolitan District of Caracas would be created and that some of the powers of the Libertador, Chacao, Baruta, Sucre, and El Hatillo municipalities would be delegated to the Alcald\u00eda Mayor, physically located in the large Libertador municipality, in the center of the city. The Metropolitan District of Caracas was suppressed on 20 December 2017 by the Constituent National Assembly of Venezuela.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCaracas is Venezuela's cultural capital, with many restaurants, theaters, museums, and shopping centers.

        "wiki": "Caracas (, Spanish: [ka\u02c8\u027eakas]), officially Santiago de Le\u00f3n de Caracas, abbreviated as CCS, is the capital and largest city of Venezuela, and the center of the Metropolitan Region of Caracas (or Greater Caracas). Caracas is located along the Guaire River in the northern part of the country, within the Caracas Valley of the Venezuelan coastal mountain range (Cordillera de la Costa). The valley is close to the Caribbean Sea, separated from the coast by a steep 2,200-metre-high (7,200 ft) mountain range, Cerro El \u00c1vila; to the south there are more hills and mountains. The Metropolitan Region of Caracas has an estimated population of almost 5 million inhabitants.\nThe center of the city is still Catedral, located near Bol\u00edvar Square, though some consider the center to be Plaza Venezuela, located in the Los Caobos area. Businesses in the city include service companies, banks, and malls. Caracas has a largely service-based economy, apart from some industrial activity in its metropolitan area. The Caracas Stock Exchange and Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA) are headquartered in Caracas. PDVSA is the largest company in Venezuela. Caracas is also Venezuela's cultural capital, with many restaurants, theaters, museums, and shopping centers. Caracas has some of the tallest skyscrapers in Latin America, such as the Parque Central Towers. The Museum of Contemporary Art of Caracas is one of the most important in South America.Caracas has one of the highest per capita murder rates in the world, with 111.19 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBefore the city was founded in 1567, the valley of Caracas was populated by indigenous peoples. Francisco Fajardo, the son of a Spanish captain and a Guaiqueri cacica, who came from Margarita, began establishing settlements in the area of La Guaira and the Caracas valley between 1555 and 1560. Fajardo attempted to establish a plantation in the valley in 1562 after these unsuccessful coastal towns, but it did not last long: it was destroyed by natives of the region led by Terepaima and Guaicaipuro. Fajardo's 1560 settlement was known as Hato de San Francisco, and another attempt in 1561 by Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Su\u00e1rez was called Villa de San Francisco, and was also destroyed by the same native people. The eventual settlers of Caracas came from Coro, the German capital of their Klein-Venedig colony around the present-day coastal Colombia\u2013Venezuela border; from the 1540s, the colony had been de facto controlled by Spaniards. Moving eastward from Coro, groups of Spanish settlers founded inland towns including Barquisimeto and Valencia before reaching the Caracas valley.On 25 July 1567, Captain Diego de Losada laid the foundations of the city of Santiago de Le\u00f3n de Caracas. De Losada had been commissioned to capture the valley, and was successful by splitting the natives into different groups to work with, then fighting and defeating each of them. The town was the closest to the coast of these new settlements, and the colonists retained a native workforce, which allowed a trade network to develop between Caracas, the interior, and Margarita; the towns further inland produced ample cotton products and beeswax, and Margarita was a rich source of pearls. The Caracas valley had a good environment for both agricultural and arable farming, which contributed to the system of commerce but meant that the town's population was initially sparse, as it was only large enough to support a few farms.In 1577, Caracas became the capital of the Spanish Empire's Venezuela Province under the province's new governor, Juan de Pimentel (1576\u20131583). In the 1580s, Caraque\u00f1os started selling food to the Spanish soldiers in Cartagena, who often docked in the coastal city when collecting products from the empire in South America. Wheat was growing increasingly expensive in the Iberian Peninsula, and the Spanish profited from buying it from Caracas farmers. This cemented the city in the empire's trade circuit.During the 16th and 17th centuries, the coast of Venezuela was frequently raided by pirates. With the coastal mountains of the Central Range as a barrier, Caracas was relatively immune to such attacks, compared to other Caribbean coastal settlements, but in 1595 the Preston\u2013Somers expedition landed and around 200 English Privateers, including George Somers and Amyas Preston, crossed the mountains through a little-used pass while the town's defenders were guarding the more frequently used one. Encountering little resistance, the invaders sacked and set fire to the town after a failed ransom negotiation. The city managed to rebuild, using wheat profits and \"a lot of sacrifice\". In the 1620s, farmers in Caracas discovered that Cacao beans could be sold, first selling them to native people of Mexico and quickly growing across the Caribbean. The city became important in the Viceroyalty of New Spain, as well as moving from largely native slave labor to African slaves, the first of the Spanish colonies to become part of the slave trade. The city was successful and operated on cacao and slave trade until the 1650s, when an alhorra blight, the Mexican Inquisition of many of their Portuguese traders, and increased cacao production in Guayaquil greatly affected the market. This and the destructive 1641 earthquake put the city into decline, and they likely began illegally trading with the Dutch Empire, which Caraque\u00f1os later proved sympathetic to; by the 1670s, Caracas had a trading route through Cura\u00e7ao.In 1728, the Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas was founded by the king, and the cacao business grew in importance. Caracas was made one of the three provinces of Nueva Granada, corresponding to Venezuela, in 1739. Over the next three decades the Viceroyalty was variously split, with Caracas province becoming the Venezuela province and then the Captaincy General of Venezuela in 1777, with Caracas as the capital. Venezuela then attempted to become independent, first with the 1797 Gual and Espa\u00f1a conspiracy, based in Caracas, and then the successful 1811 Venezuelan Declaration of Independence. Caracas then came under worse luck: in 1812, an earthquake destroyed Caracas, a quarter of its population migrated in 1814, and the Venezuelan War of Independence continued until 24 June 1821, when Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar defeated royalists in the Battle of Carabobo. Urban reforms only took place towards the end of the 19th century, under Antonio Guzm\u00e1n Blanco: some landmarks were built, but the city remained distinctly colonial until the 1930s.\n\nCaracas grew in size, population, and economic importance during Venezuela's oil boom in the early 20th century. In the 1950s, the metropolitan area of Gran Caracas was developed, and the city began an intensive modernization program, funding public buildings, which continued throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. Cultural landmarks, like the University City of Caracas, designed by modernist architect Carlos Ra\u00fal Villanueva and declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2000; the Caracas Museum of Contemporary Art; and the Teresa Carre\u00f1o Cultural Complex were built, as well as the Caracas Metro and a developed downtown area. Urban development was rapid, leading to the growth of slums on the hillsides surrounding the new city. Much of the city development also fell into disrepair come the end of the 20th century, with the 1980s oil glut and political instability like the Caracazo, meaning maintenance can not be sustained. The economic and social problems persist throughout the capital and country, characterized as the Crisis in Venezuela. Caracas is the most violent city in the world.\n\n\n== Coat of arms ==\nThe coat of arms was adopted in 1591. Sim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar, an ancestor of Venezuelan liberator Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, had been named the first procurator general of the Venezuelan province in 1589. He served as the representative of Venezuela to the Spanish Crown, and vice versa. In 1591, de Bol\u00edvar introduced a petition to King Philip II for a coat of arms, which he granted by Royal Cedula on 4 September that year in San Lorenzo. The coat of arms represents the city's name with the red Santiago (St. James') cross. It originally depicted \"a brown bear rampant on a field of silver, holding between its paws a golden shell with the red cross of Santiago; and its seal is a crown with five golden points\". In the same act, the king declared Caracas as \"The Most Noble and Very Loyal City of Santiago de Le\u00f3n de Caracas\".The anthem of the city is the Marcha a Caracas, written by the composer Tiero Pezzuti de Matteis with the lyrics by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Sarabia and approved in 1984.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nCaracas is contained entirely within a valley of the Venezuelan Central Range, and is separated from the Caribbean coast by a roughly 15-kilometre (9 mi) expanse of El \u00c1vila National Park. The valley is relatively small and quite irregular, and the altitude varies from between 870 and 1,043 meters (2,854 and 3,422 ft) above sea level; the historic center lies at about 900 meters (3,000 feet) above sea level. This, along with the rapid population growth, has profoundly influenced the urban development of the city. The most elevated point of the Capital District, wherein the city is located, is the Pico El \u00c1vila, which rises to 2,159 meters (7,083 feet).The main body of water in Caracas is the Guaire River, which flows across the city and empties into the Tuy River, which is also fed by the El Valle and San Pedro rivers, in addition to numerous streams which descend from El \u00c1vila. The La Mariposa and Camatagua reservoirs provide water to the city. The city is occasionally subject to earthquakes \u2013 notably in 1641 and 1967.\nGeologically, Caracas was formed in the Late Cretaceous period, with much of the rest of the Caribbean, and sits on what is mostly metamorphic rock. Deformation of the land in this period formed the region.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Caracas has a mix of tropical savanna climate (Aw) with subtropical highland (Cwb) influences due to its altitude. Caracas is also intertropical, with precipitation that varies between 900 and 1,300 millimeters (35 and 51 inches) (annual), in the city proper, and up to 2,000 millimeters (79 inches) in some parts of the Mountain range. While Caracas is within the tropics, due to its altitude temperatures are generally not nearly as high as other tropical locations at sea level.

Finally in 1956 the first stone was laid; in 1963 was formally inaugurated and opened to the public, and since then has served as a religious temple of the Jewish community of Caracas.\nIn late January 2009, the synagogue was desecrated and vandalized by a criminal gang. The attack followed the escalated tensions between the Israeli and Venezuelan governments after the Gaza\u2013Israel conflict of 2008-09. Three former policeman and three civilians were found guilty and sentenced to 10 year of jail by the local justice department.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Caracas (, Spanish: [ka\u02c8\u027eakas]), officially Santiago de Le\u00f3n de Caracas, abbreviated as CCS, is the capital and largest city of Venezuela, and the center of the Metropolitan Region of Caracas (or Greater Caracas). Caracas is located along the Guaire River in the northern part of the country, within the Caracas Valley of the Venezuelan coastal mountain range (Cordillera de la Costa). The valley is close to the Caribbean Sea, separated from the coast by a steep 2,200-metre-high (7,200 ft) mountain range, Cerro El \u00c1vila; to the south there are more hills and mountains. The Metropolitan Region of Caracas has an estimated population of almost 5 million inhabitants.\nThe center of the city is still Catedral, located near Bol\u00edvar Square, though some consider the center to be Plaza Venezuela, located in the Los Caobos area. Businesses in the city include service companies, banks, and malls. Caracas has a largely service-based economy, apart from some industrial activity in its metropolitan area. The Caracas Stock Exchange and Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA) are headquartered in Caracas. PDVSA is the largest company in Venezuela. Caracas is also Venezuela's cultural capital, with many restaurants, theaters, museums, and shopping centers. Caracas has some of the tallest skyscrapers in Latin America, such as the Parque Central Towers. The Museum of Contemporary Art of Caracas is one of the most important in South America.Caracas has one of the highest per capita murder rates in the world, with 111.19 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBefore the city was founded in 1567, the valley of Caracas was populated by indigenous peoples. Francisco Fajardo, the son of a Spanish captain and a Guaiqueri cacica, who came from Margarita, began establishing settlements in the area of La Guaira and the Caracas valley between 1555 and 1560. Fajardo attempted to establish a plantation in the valley in 1562 after these unsuccessful coastal towns, but it did not last long: it was destroyed by natives of the region led by Terepaima and Guaicaipuro. Fajardo's 1560 settlement was known as Hato de San Francisco, and another attempt in 1561 by Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Su\u00e1rez was called Villa de San Francisco, and was also destroyed by the same native people. The eventual settlers of Caracas came from Coro, the German capital of their Klein-Venedig colony around the present-day coastal Colombia\u2013Venezuela border; from the 1540s, the colony had been de facto controlled by Spaniards. Moving eastward from Coro, groups of Spanish settlers founded inland towns including Barquisimeto and Valencia before reaching the Caracas valley.On 25 July 1567, Captain Diego de Losada laid the foundations of the city of Santiago de Le\u00f3n de Caracas. De Losada had been commissioned to capture the valley, and was successful by splitting the natives into different groups to work with, then fighting and defeating each of them. The town was the closest to the coast of these new settlements, and the colonists retained a native workforce, which allowed a trade network to develop between Caracas, the interior, and Margarita; the towns further inland produced ample cotton products and beeswax, and Margarita was a rich source of pearls. The Caracas valley had a good environment for both agricultural and arable farming, which contributed to the system of commerce but meant that the town's population was initially sparse, as it was only large enough to support a few farms.In 1577, Caracas became the capital of the Spanish Empire's Venezuela Province under the province's new governor, Juan de Pimentel (1576\u20131583). In the 1580s, Caraque\u00f1os started selling food to the Spanish soldiers in Cartagena, who often docked in the coastal city when collecting products from the empire in South America. Wheat was growing increasingly expensive in the Iberian Peninsula, and the Spanish profited from buying it from Caracas farmers. This cemented the city in the empire's trade circuit.During the 16th and 17th centuries, the coast of Venezuela was frequently raided by pirates. With the coastal mountains of the Central Range as a barrier, Caracas was relatively immune to such attacks, compared to other Caribbean coastal settlements, but in 1595 the Preston\u2013Somers expedition landed and around 200 English Privateers, including George Somers and Amyas Preston, crossed the mountains through a little-used pass while the town's defenders were guarding the more frequently used one. Encountering little resistance, the invaders sacked and set fire to the town after a failed ransom negotiation. The city managed to rebuild, using wheat profits and \"a lot of sacrifice\". In the 1620s, farmers in Caracas discovered that Cacao beans could be sold, first selling them to native people of Mexico and quickly growing across the Caribbean. The city became important in the Viceroyalty of New Spain, as well as moving from largely native slave labor to African slaves, the first of the Spanish colonies to become part of the slave trade. The city was successful and operated on cacao and slave trade until the 1650s, when an alhorra blight, the Mexican Inquisition of many of their Portuguese traders, and increased cacao production in Guayaquil greatly affected the market. This and the destructive 1641 earthquake put the city into decline, and they likely began illegally trading with the Dutch Empire, which Caraque\u00f1os later proved sympathetic to; by the 1670s, Caracas had a trading route through Cura\u00e7ao.In 1728, the Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas was founded by the king, and the cacao business grew in importance. Caracas was made one of the three provinces of Nueva Granada, corresponding to Venezuela, in 1739. Over the next three decades the Viceroyalty was variously split, with Caracas province becoming the Venezuela province and then the Captaincy General of Venezuela in 1777, with Caracas as the capital. Venezuela then attempted to become independent, first with the 1797 Gual and Espa\u00f1a conspiracy, based in Caracas, and then the successful 1811 Venezuelan Declaration of Independence. Caracas then came under worse luck: in 1812, an earthquake destroyed Caracas, a quarter of its population migrated in 1814, and the Venezuelan War of Independence continued until 24 June 1821, when Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar defeated royalists in the Battle of Carabobo. Urban reforms only took place towards the end of the 19th century, under Antonio Guzm\u00e1n Blanco: some landmarks were built, but the city remained distinctly colonial until the 1930s.\n\nCaracas grew in size, population, and economic importance during Venezuela's oil boom in the early 20th century. In the 1950s, the metropolitan area of Gran Caracas was developed, and the city began an intensive modernization program, funding public buildings, which continued throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. Cultural landmarks, like the University City of Caracas, designed by modernist architect Carlos Ra\u00fal Villanueva and declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2000; the Caracas Museum of Contemporary Art; and the Teresa Carre\u00f1o Cultural Complex were built, as well as the Caracas Metro and a developed downtown area. Urban development was rapid, leading to the growth of slums on the hillsides surrounding the new city. Much of the city development also fell into disrepair come the end of the 20th century, with the 1980s oil glut and political instability like the Caracazo, meaning maintenance can not be sustained. The economic and social problems persist throughout the capital and country, characterized as the Crisis in Venezuela. Caracas is the most violent city in the world.\n\n\n== Coat of arms ==\nThe coat of arms was adopted in 1591. Sim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar, an ancestor of Venezuelan liberator Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, had been named the first procurator general of the Venezuelan province in 1589. He served as the representative of Venezuela to the Spanish Crown, and vice versa. In 1591, de Bol\u00edvar introduced a petition to King Philip II for a coat of arms, which he granted by Royal Cedula on 4 September that year in San Lorenzo. The coat of arms represents the city's name with the red Santiago (St. James') cross. It originally depicted \"a brown bear rampant on a field of silver, holding between its paws a golden shell with the red cross of Santiago; and its seal is a crown with five golden points\". In the same act, the king declared Caracas as \"The Most Noble and Very Loyal City of Santiago de Le\u00f3n de Caracas\".The anthem of the city is the Marcha a Caracas, written by the composer Tiero Pezzuti de Matteis with the lyrics by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Sarabia and approved in 1984.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nCaracas is contained entirely within a valley of the Venezuelan Central Range, and is separated from the Caribbean coast by a roughly 15-kilometre (9 mi) expanse of El \u00c1vila National Park. The valley is relatively small and quite irregular, and the altitude varies from between 870 and 1,043 meters (2,854 and 3,422 ft) above sea level; the historic center lies at about 900 meters (3,000 feet) above sea level. This, along with the rapid population growth, has profoundly influenced the urban development of the city. The most elevated point of the Capital District, wherein the city is located, is the Pico El \u00c1vila, which rises to 2,159 meters (7,083 feet).The main body of water in Caracas is the Guaire River, which flows across the city and empties into the Tuy River, which is also fed by the El Valle and San Pedro rivers, in addition to numerous streams which descend from El \u00c1vila. The La Mariposa and Camatagua reservoirs provide water to the city. The city is occasionally subject to earthquakes \u2013 notably in 1641 and 1967.\nGeologically, Caracas was formed in the Late Cretaceous period, with much of the rest of the Caribbean, and sits on what is mostly metamorphic rock. Deformation of the land in this period formed the region.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Caracas has a mix of tropical savanna climate (Aw) with subtropical highland (Cwb) influences due to its altitude. Caracas is also intertropical, with precipitation that varies between 900 and 1,300 millimeters (35 and 51 inches) (annual), in the city proper, and up to 2,000 millimeters (79 inches) in some parts of the Mountain range. While Caracas is within the tropics, due to its altitude temperatures are generally not nearly as high as other tropical locations at sea level. The annual average temperature is approximately 23.8 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F), with the average of the coldest month (January) 22.8 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) and the average of the warmest month (July) 25.0 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F), which gives a small annual thermal amplitude of 2.2 \u00b0C (4.0 \u00b0F).In the months of December and January abundant fog may appear, in addition to a sudden nightly drop in temperature, until reaching 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F). This peculiar weather is known by the natives of Caracas as the Pacheco. In addition, nightly temperatures at any time of the year are much (14 to 20 \u00b0C) lower than daytime highs and usually do not remain above 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F), resulting in very pleasant evening temperatures. Hail storms appear in Caracas, although only on rare occasions. Electrical storms are much more frequent, especially between June and October, due to the city being in a closed valley and the orographic action of Cerro El \u00c1vila.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAccording to the population census of 2011 the Caracas proper (Distrito Capital) is over 1.9 million inhabitants, while that of the Metropolitan District of Caracas is estimated at 2.9 million as of 2011. The majority of the population is mixed-race, typically with varying degrees of European, African, Indigenous and occasional Asian ancestry. There is a noteworthy Afro-Venezuelan community. Additionally, the city has a large number of both European Venezuelans and Asian Venezuelans who descend from the massive influx of various immigrants Venezuela received from all across Eurasia during the 20th century; in particular are descendants of Spaniards, Portuguese, Italians, Chinese, Colombians, Germans, Syrians and Lebanese people. In 2020, the poorest 55% of the Caracas population lived on about a third of its land, in poorly-planned slums that are generally dangerous to live in and access.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\n\nVenezuela and its capital, Caracas, are reported to both have among the highest per capita murder rates in the world. Caracas is the city with the highest homicide rate in the world outside of a warzone, with a 2016 rate of around 120 murders per 100,000 people. Most murders and other violent crimes go unsolved, with estimates of the number of unresolved crimes as high as 98%. The U.S. Department of State and British Foreign and Commonwealth Office have issued travel warnings for Venezuela (especially Caracas) due to high rates of crime.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nBusinesses that are located in Caracas include service companies, banks, and malls, among others. It has a largely service-based economy, apart from some industrial activity in its metropolitan area. The Caracas Stock Exchange and Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA) are headquartered here. PDVSA, a state-run organization, is the largest company in Venezuela, and negotiates all the international agreements for the distribution and export of petroleum. When it existed, the airline Viasa had its headquarters in the Torre Viasa.Several international companies and embassies are located in El Rosal and Las Mercedes, in the Caracas area. The city also serves as a hub for communication and transportation infrastructure between the metropolitan area and the rest of the country. Important industries in Caracas include chemicals, textiles, leather, food, iron, and wood products. There are also rubber and cement factories. Its nominal GDP is US$70 billion and the GDP (PPP) per capita is US$24,000.A 2009 United Nations survey reported that the cost of living in Caracas was 89% of that of the survey's baseline city, New York. However, this statistic is based upon a fixed currency-exchange-rate of 2003 and might not be completely realistic, due to the elevated inflation rates of the last several years.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nIn 2013, the World Economic Forum evaluated countries in terms of how successful they were in advertising campaigns to attract foreign visitors. Out of the 140 countries evaluated, Venezuela came last. A major factor that has contributed to the lack of foreign visitors has been poor transport for tourists. Venezuela has limited railway systems and airlines. High crime rates and the negative attitude of the Venezuelan population towards tourism also contributed to the poor evaluation.In an attempt to attract more foreign visitors, the Venezuelan Ministry of Tourism invested in multiple hotel infrastructures. The largest hotel investment has been in the Hotel Alba Caracas. The cost for the general maintenance of the north and south towers of the hotel is approximately 231.5 million Venezuelan bolivars. Although the Venezuelan Ministry of Tourism has taken the initiative to recognize the importance of the tourism industry, the Venezuelan government has not placed the tourism industry as an economic priority. In 2013, the budget for the Ministry of Tourism was only 173.8 million bolivars, while the Ministry of the Youth received approximately 724.6 million bolivars. The tourism industry in Venezuela contributes approximately 3.8 percent of the country GDP. The World Economic Forum predicts Venezuela's GDP to rise to 4.2 percent by 2022.\n\n\n== Government ==\nOn 8 March 2000, the year after a new constitution was introduced in Venezuela, it was decreed in Gaceta Official N\u00b0 36,906 that the Metropolitan District of Caracas would be created and that some of the powers of the Libertador, Chacao, Baruta, Sucre, and El Hatillo municipalities would be delegated to the Alcald\u00eda Mayor, physically located in the large Libertador municipality, in the center of the city. The Metropolitan District of Caracas was suppressed on 20 December 2017 by the Constituent National Assembly of Venezuela.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCaracas is Venezuela's cultural capital, with many restaurants, theaters, museums, and shopping centers. The city is home to many immigrants from Spain, Italy, Portugal, the Middle East, Germany, China, and other Latin American countries.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nProfessional sports teams in the city include the football clubs Caracas F\u00fatbol Club, Deportivo Petare, Atl\u00e9tico Venezuela, SD Centro Italo Venezolano, Estrella Roja FC and Deportivo La Guaira. Deportivo Petare has reached the semi-finals of international tournaments, such as the Copa Libertadores, while the Caracas F\u00fatbol Club has reached the quarterfinals. Baseball teams Tiburones de La Guaira and Leones del Caracas play at University Stadium, with a capacity of nearly 26,000 spectators.The football stadiums in the city include the Olympic Stadium, home to Caracas F\u00fatbol Club and Deportivo La Guaira, with a capacity of 30,000 spectators, and the Br\u00edgido Iriarte Stadium, home to Atl\u00e9tico Venezuela, with a capacity of 12,000 spectators. In basketball, the Cocodrilos de Caracas play their games in the Poliedro de Caracas in the El Para\u00edso neighborhood.Caracas is the seat of the National Institute of Sports and of the Venezuelan Olympic Committee. The city hosted the 1983 Pan American Games.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Central University of Venezuela ===\n\nThe Central University of Venezuela (Universidad Central de Venezuela, UCV) is a public university founded in 1721: it is the oldest university in Venezuela. The university campus was designed by architect Carlos Ra\u00fal Villanueva and declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000.\n\n\n=== Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar University ===\n\nThe Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar University (Universidad Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, USB) is a public institution in Caracas that focuses on science and technology. Its motto is \"La Universidad de la Excelencia\" (\"University of Excellence\").\n\n\n=== Other universities ===\nAcademia Militar de Venezuela\nEscuela de Formaci\u00f3n de Oficiales de las Fuerzas Armadas de Cooperaci\u00f3n\nUniversidad Cat\u00f3lica Andr\u00e9s Bello\nUniversidad Nacional Experimental de la Gran Caracas\nUniversidad Metropolitana\nUniversidad Nacional Experimental de las Artes\nUniversidad Monte\u00e1vila\nUniversidad Nueva Esparta\nUniversidad Santa Maria\nUniversidad Alejandro de Humboldt\nUniversidad Nacional Experimental de las Fuerzas Armadas\nUniversidad Nacional Experimental Sim\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez\nUniversidad Bolivariana de Venezuela\nUniversidad Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Vargas\nUniversidad Pedag\u00f3gica Experimental Libertador\nUniversidad Experimental Polit\u00e9cnica Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre\n\n\n=== International schools ===\nBritish School of Caracas\nColegio Internacional de Caracas\nEscuela Campo Alegre\nInternational Christian School\nTomchei Tmimim\nLyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais de Caracas - Colegio Francia\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nThe Caracas Metro has been in operation since 27 March 1983. With 4 lines, 47 stations and about 10 more to be constructed. It covers a great part of the city and also has an integrated ticket system that combines the route of the Metro with those offered by the Metrob\u00fas, a bus service of the Caracas Metro. In 2010, the first segment of a new ariel cable car system opened, Metrocable which feeds into the larger metro system.\nBuses are the main means of mass transportation. There are two bus systems: the traditional system and the Metrob\u00fas. Other transportation services include the IFE train to and from the Tuy Valley cities of Charallave and C\u00faa; the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar International Airport, the biggest and most important in the country; the metro additional services Caracas Aerial Tramway and Los Teques Metro (connecting Caracas with the suburban city of Los Teques); and the Generalissimo Francisco de Miranda Air Base used by military aviation and government airplanes.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and Sister Cities ===\nCaracas is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities ===\nCaracas is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities from 12 October 1982 establishing brotherly relations with the following cities:\n\n\n== See also ==\nGreater Caracas\nLarge Cities Climate Leadership Group\nLa Silsa\nList of metropolitan areas of Venezuela\nCaracazo\nVenezuela 60-day state of emergency\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Caracas travel guide from Wikivoyage",

        "wiki": "The Teresa Carre\u00f1o Cultural Complex (Complejo Cultural Teresa Carre\u00f1o), also known as Teresa Carre\u00f1o Theater (Teatro Teresa Carre\u00f1o), is the most important theatre of Caracas and Venezuela, where performances include symphonic and popular concerts, opera, ballet and plays. It is the second largest theater in South America after the N\u00e9stor Kirchner Cultural Centre at Buenos Aires.\nThe theatre was built on a 22,000-square-metre (240,000 sq ft) lot and named after the Venezuelan pianist Teresa Carre\u00f1o. It is located in the cultural district of the city: Bellas Artes. It houses two concert halls: the Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Ribas and the R\u00edos Reyna (named after Pedro Antonio R\u00edos Reyna).\nThe following are resident performing arts groups:\n\nTeresa Carre\u00f1o Opera Choir\nTeresa Carre\u00f1o Ballet directed up to 2002 by choreographer Vicente Nebrada\nNational Philarmonic Orchestra of Venezuela.Its spaces are also shared by the National Theater Company of Venezuela and the Monte \u00c1vila Editores bookstore (Librer\u00edas del Sur).\nThe artistic director of the theater is the Venezuelan conductor Rodolfo Saglimbeni.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the 1970s, Pedro Antonio R\u00edos Reyna presented a plan to build a theatre to serve as the residence of the Venezuela Symphony Orchestra. The Sim\u00f3n Bolivar Center expanded the project so that the center would serve multiple uses.\nThe funds for construction were granted in September 1970, and the architects were Tom\u00e1s Lugo, Jes\u00fas Sandoval, and Dietrich Kunckel.\nThe theatre was inaugurated in two phases: the Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Ribas Hall in February 1976, followed by the R\u00edos Reyna Hall and the rest of the complex on 19 April 1983.\nThe center facilities have been expanded with two exhibition halls, one dedicated to the pianist Teresa Carre\u00f1o and another one to the composer Reynaldo Hahn.\n\n\n== Performance venues ==\n\nThe Teresa Carre\u00f1o Theatre is an architectonical and cultural masterpiece of Venezuela. It covers a surface of 22,586 m2 (243,110 sq ft) and has a completed area of over 80,000 m2 (860,000 sq ft).\nEnormous columns and hexagonal roofs in a harmonic overlaid position, integrate the majestic expression of joint architecture and pluralist nature, making it a unique theatre.\n\nThe R\u00edos Reyna Hall holds 2,400 people. It is the stage for symphonic and multi-genre concerts, operas, Broadway musicals, and the most important ballet company of the city.\nThe Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Ribas Hall was designed for symphonic and chamber music. Given its intimacy, it could be described as a studio space. It takes the form of a Greek semicircular theatre, a space of 507.5 square meters, a lobby of 160 square meters and capacity for 440 people. It was the official building of the Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar (Venezuela's youth orchestra) from 1976 until the opening of the Inter-American Center for Social Action through Music in 2007.\n\n\n== Artwork ==\nThe Theater has extraordinary decoration, with fine pieces of artwork.\n\nThere are some major master pieces from the Venezuelan sculptor Jes\u00fas Rafael Soto: white vibrant cubes on yellow projection (in the ceiling of the entrance of the R\u00edos Reyna Hall), vibrant Buckets on white and black progression (in the parking, in front of the Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Ribas Hall), vibrant Pyramids (acoustic ceiling of the Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Ribas Hall), black Scripture on white bottom and fire-resistant drop curtain (drop curtains of the R\u00edos Reyna Hall).\nPedro Basalo created the Bust of Teresa Carre\u00f1o located in Cellar 1 area.\nHarry Abend developed the Relief mural on inclined screens (in the troncopyramidal peak of the scene of the R\u00edos Reyna).\nThere are also major artists with  a presence in the Cultural Complex, such as Erling Oloe, Colette Dellozane, Jorge Pizzani and Vincenzo Gemito.\n\n\n== Teatro Teresa Carre\u00f1o Ballet ==\nIt is one of the stable organizations (alongside the Chorus) created from the start of the theatre in 1979. Its debut was in 1980, and since then it has played several important ballets such as The Nutcracker, Guaraira Repano, Swan Lake, Carmen, and others. It is currently composed of around 30 dancers from all over the country.\nIts current choreographer is Laura Fiorucci, and the main coordinator of the Ballet is Luis Penso.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of concert halls\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Teresa Carre\u00f1o Cultural Complex official site",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Central University of Venezuela (or Universidad Central de Venezuela, UCV, in Spanish) is a public university of Venezuela located in Caracas. It is widely held to be the highest ranking institution in the country, and it also ranks 18th in Latin America. Founded in 1721, it is the oldest university in Venezuela and one of the oldest in the Western Hemisphere.\nThe main university campus, Ciudad Universitaria de Caracas, was designed by architect Carlos Ra\u00fal Villanueva and it is considered a masterpiece of urban planning and was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2000.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe origin of the university goes back to Friar Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez de Acu\u00f1a (1620\u20131682), a Peruvian Bishop who studied theology at the Universidad de San Marcos and founded in 1673 the Seminary Saint Rose of Lima in Caracas named after the first Catholic Saint born in the Americas. In the following years, Friar Diego de Ba\u00f1os y Sotomayor broadened the scope of the seminary by creating the School and Seminary of Saint Rose of Lima in 1696. Yet, in spite of the creation of the seminar, students who wished to obtain a university degree had to travel great distances to attend universities located in Santo Domingo, Bogot\u00e1 or Mexico City. Given such harsh circumstances, the Rector of the Seminary, Francisco Mart\u00ednez de Porras and the people of Caracas requested the royal court in Madrid the creation of a university in Venezuela (then part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada). As a result, on 22 December 1721 Philip V of Spain signed in Lerma a Royal Decree that transformed the School-Seminary into the Universidad Real y Pontificia de Caracas. The Royal Decree was concurred by Pope Innocent XIII with a Papal bull in 1722. The university offered degrees in Philosophy, Theology, Canon law and Medicine. Until 1810, when the Seminary of Saint Bonaventura located in M\u00e9rida became the Universidad de Los Andes, the Universidad Real y Pontificia de Caracas was the only university existing in the country.\n\n\n=== Republican years ===\nUntil the end of the 18th century, the official papal and royal censorship on books was largely ignored in Venezuela, a situation which allowed the smuggling of the works by Rousseau, Voltaire, Diderot, Montesquieu, Locke, Helvetius, Grotius in the ships belonging to the Guipuzcoana Company.\nThe Royal constitution was displaced by the Republican Statutes proclaimed by Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar on 24 June 1827. The new statutes gave the institution a secular character and transferred the main authority to the Rector.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nOn December 1908, Juan Vicente G\u00f3mez came into power with a coup d'\u00e9tat against the government of Cipriano Castro. G\u00f3mez stayed in power until his death in 1935, and during this time the Dictator, having ambivalent feelings about the purpose of educating free minds when he could hire foreigners to exercise any technical requirements for the nation, decided to close the university from 1912 to 1922. When it reopened, the Rector Felipe Guevara Rojas had reorganized the traditional division of only a few schools, separating them into departments.\n1928 became a very important year for the university when a group of students, known as the Generation of 1928, organized events during the \"Students Week\" protesting the dictatorship which culminated in an attempt to overthrow G\u00f3mez on 7 April of that year. This group, which shared a common front against G\u00f3mez, was conformed by people like R\u00f3mulo Betancourt, Miguel Otero Silva, Juan Oropeza, Isaac Pardo and Rodolfo Quintero. Most of them were jailed after the events or went into exile without being able to finish their studies.\nThe university continued to be at the forefront of the democratization of the country when in 1936, then President Eleazar L\u00f3pez Contreras, ordered a decree suspending the Constitutional rights and declaring a general censorship of the press because the oil workers decided to start a strike (an unprecedented deed at the time). The Rector of the University, Francisco Antonio R\u00edsquez, led the protest that followed through the streets of Caracas against the policies of L\u00f3pez Contreras.\nBy 1942, the student population had been growing steadily for decades without any significant expansion of the University. Instead several schools, like Medicine, were moved to other buildings around the city. The administration of President Isa\u00edas Medina Angarita felt the need to move the university to a larger and more modern location where it could function as coherent whole. The government bought the Hacienda Ibarra and the responsibility of the main design was given to the architect Carlos Ra\u00fal Villanueva after a visit to the University City of Bogot\u00e1 convinced the authorities of the Ministry of Public Works that, in order to avoid constructing a group of heterogeneous buildings, the design should be under one architect.\n\nThe new campus was going to become a vast urban complex of about 200 hectares and included 40 buildings. Villanueva worked with 28 avant-garde artists of the time, from Venezuela and the rest of the world, to build what continues to be one of the most successful applications of Modern Architecture in Latin America. Villanueva's guiding principle was the creation of a space where art and architecture cohabited in harmony in a \"Synthesis of Arts\". Among some of the most important pieces present in the university are the 1953 Floating Clouds by Alexander Calder, murals by Victor Vasarely, Wifredo Lam, Fernand L\u00e9ger and sculptures by Jean Arp and Henri Laurens. The Ciudad Universitaria de Caracas was declared World Heritage by UNESCO, and it is the only modern university campus designed by a single architect to receive such high honor.\nIn 1958, after the fall of dictator Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez, a government commission established a new law for the universities. The new law came into place on 5 December, guaranteeing that faculty and students could work in an environment of freedom and tolerance. This very important legal foundation was however abused during the 1960s when guerrilla rebels, supported by Fidel Castro took refuge inside the university campus to escape prosecution from the government. This tense situation came to a stalemate in 1969 when students asking for a reform took over the university. On 3 October 1970, the administration of President Rafael Caldera ordered the university to be raided by the military and Rector Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Bianco was forced to resign. The university reopened in 1971 with a new Rector and a new plan for renovation.\nIn terms of the academic development of the modern university, the second half of the 20th century was a time when the Central University's faculty body benefited greatly from the influx of European immigrants. Many intellectuals settled in Venezuela after the end of the Spanish Civil War and World War II and found jobs at the university. Those scientists and humanists helped develop lines of research and teaching at the university and educated many of the present generation of faculty members.\n\n\n== Organization and degrees ==\nThe university is organized into 11 schools (Facultades) which are subdivided into 40 departments (Escuelas).\nAll schools offer undergraduate degrees at the level of Licenciatura (5 years) and graduate degrees at the level of master's degree (2 years) and PhD (3\u20134 years) from the Graduate School. The Graduate School, founded in 1941, offers 222 different specializations, 109 Master's degrees and 40 PhDs.\n\nArchitecture and Urban planning\nAgronomy\nDentistry\nEngineeringHumanities and EducationLaw and GovernmentMedicineSocial Sciences and EconomyPharmacy\nSciencesVeterinary\n\n\n== Research ranking ==\n\nThe Ranking Iberoamericano de Instituciones de Investigacion based on the Institute for Scientific Information ranked the Central University of Venezuela as the most productive research institution in the country and as the 20th most productive in Latin America.\nOther top 25 positions were reached in the following areas:\n\n8th in Law\n10th in Social Sciences\n12th in Psychology and Education\n15th in Physiology and Pharmacology\n16th in Philology and Philosophy\n16th in Food technology\n18th in Mathematics\n18th in Medicine\n21st in Plant and Animal Biology\n21st in History and Art\n22nd in Architecture and Civil Engineering\n22nd Molecular BiologyThe 2010 University Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP), ranked the UCV as the best university in Venezuela and 805th university in the world.\nThe 2016 QS World University Rankings placed the UCV as 18th overall in their Latin American Universities Ranking.\n\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n\n\n=== Humanists ===\nFrancisco de Miranda (1750\u20131816) General, political thinker; fought in the main three revolutionary wars of the 18th century, American, French and South American.\nAndr\u00e9s Bello (1781\u20131865) Poet, lawmaker, philosopher, educator and philologist.\nSylvia Constantinidis (1962) Pianist, composer, conductor, music educator, author, writer.

It was declared a national park on May 26, 1974 by Executive Order No. 113, Official Gazette No. 30408 on May 27, 1974.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe park extends across both terrestrial and aquatic areas of Golfo Triste. It contains an area of mangroves and numerous islets or cays among which are Borracho, Muerto, Sombrero, Sal, Las Animas and Peraza, among others. There are spectaculars white sand beaches on these cays; Mero, Paiclas, los Juanes, Playuela, Tucupido, Azul, Boca Seca and many more. The park's internal bays and mangroves, cays and islands sit in the relief of Chichiriviche hills, with elevations of 250 m.\nThe Declaration as a National Park or Protected Area means the following:\n\nDo not allow the alteration of each of the ecosystems that make up the Morrocoy National Park, such as: coral reefs and seagrass beds, keys, bass, halophytic, mangroves and coastal lagoons, savannas and deciduous forests. Thus conserving biodiversity and ecological balance of the park.\nEnsure natural migrations of animal species.\nRecovery of areas and ecosystems that have been impacted by man and ensure that these and all others remain in excellent conditions.\nEncourage and provide the best conditions to promote scientific research and environmental education.\nCreate and promote activities that promote tourism and recreation, as long as it keep the conservation of the entire ecosystem of Morrocoy National Park.\nPreserve all historic sites, and archeological spelunking in the park.\n\n\n== Access ==\n\nFrom Caracas, take the Central Regional Highway to past the dealer Guacara (approximately 140 km).

In the Mor\u00f3n dealer takes the highway Mor\u00f3n-Tucacas and after traveling 40 km it reach the entrance to the Morrocoy National Park.\n\n\n== Fauna ==\n\nThe park is inhabited by numerous species of birds, about 266, as report by Cuare Wildlife Refuge. Because Morrocoy National Park and Wildlife Refuge Cuare are located in the same geographic area, it is inferred that the park should be have a similar number. Some notable species are: the osprey; vulnerable species such as flamingo, palette heron, pelican; species of birds whose preferred habitat is the mangrove nesting and resting such as, Neotropic, Chusmita or white Garcita, the helmeted cockaded, the  amazona real parrot, the red scarlet ibis, pechiblanca heron (tricolored heron); and species with restricted distribution such as the frigatebird or earwig. Tues mangroves of Morrocoy Bay are excellent bird sanctuaries, especially on the island of P\u00e1jaros located in the central area of the park, which is covered with mangrove cay.\nThere are also many other types of animals living in the park. Marine reptiles include the various turtle species such as the green sea turtle, the hawksbill turtle, cardon turle, horned turtle as well as the coastal alligator, all considered by the red book as endangered. Among mammals are both marine mammals (dolphins, whales) that use the park as a refuge and the different species of land mammals which are located mainly in the Chichiriviche Hill, among which are the brocket deer and caramerudo deer, the anteater, the crab-eating fox, howler monkey, sloth, opossum, paca, agouti and peccary cinched. Fish breeding in the park are grouper, snapper, curbina, tarpon, snook, toadfish, school shark, sardines, mackerel, grunt, the barracuda, black pacu and various fish that inhabit the coral reefs . Shellfish species are the mangrove oyster, sea hares, quigua, 2 types of lobsters (Panulirus argus, Panulirus grettatus), blue and red crabs, and other species. There is also a diverse range of insects, although there is still information being gathered for the area.\nThe park's wildlife has suffered a major negative impact due to indiscriminate activities done by man, there has been a significant decline in coral species, which have been declining in recent years.\n\n\n== Flora ==\nThe flora corresponds to the area of tropical dry forest. The vegetation is quite varied and is closely associated with geomorphological positions, the most important subsets being: coast, coastal lagoons, marshes, saline shoals, keys, and shallow seabed. It ranges from evergreen plants, such as olives, to deciduous plants like naked Indian. Plants are adapted to high salinity soils as in the case of glass grass. Continuing toward the east slope of the Chichiriviche hill towards Mayorquina, xerophytic vegetation of the cactus family can be seen. Red mangrove, black mangrove, white mangrove, buttonwood mangrove, mangrove vegetation are the dominant vegetation and landscape of the National Park, and form a unit that preserves ecologically fragile balance of the coastline, in an area of approximately 4,500 ha. Among the underwater marine growth, a wide variety of algae, including seagrass, which is one of the favorite foods of the green turtle.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nThe warm tropical climate is influenced by the northeast trade winds, with low rates of precipitation. Temperature is relatively uniform throughout the year between 27 and 35 \u00b0C. In cold weather it can reach temperatures between 23-26 \u00b0C. The rainiest period extends from August to December, particularly in November and December.\n\n\n== Tourist activities ==\n\nMorrocoy National Park has a wide range of potential environmental and landscapes, coupled with extraordinary landscape scenarios that characterize each of the places that make up the park, rich in biodiversity and beauty.\nMorrocoy beaches are spectacular and numerous: Sombrero cay, Playuela, Playuelita, Alem\u00e1n cay, Mayorquina, Pescadores cay, Mero beach, Punta Brava, Boca Paicl\u00e1s, Boca Seca, los Juanes, Bajo Caim\u00e1n, Tucupido, Sal cay, borracho cay etc. Beneath the beaches corals and fish offer their best to divers. Nearby there are also three islets outside the area of the park (about 7 nautical miles or 13 kilometres from Tucacas) maintaining a status of Special Protection Area: Norte, Medio cay and Sur cay.\nAt 285m high, Chichiriviche Hill is the highest point in the park. It stands in high relief amid the surrounding coastal environment, of Tertiary-period coral origin, belonging to the geological formation called Capadare - Agua Linda. The Chichiriviche Hill, is the landscape less associated with coastal and marine nature that characterizes the Morrocoy National Park.\nWithin the Morrocoy National Park bulk flow of tourists from all over the national territory, who will enjoy the variety of beaches, some come to camp and others come with their boats. As a national park, is under the supervision of INPARQUES (National Parks Institute) who maintains order and control.\nWithin the park are various communities, towns, businesses, and inns.

Some inns for tourists are Posada La Esmeralda, Para\u00edso Azul, Las Trinitarias, El Solar de la Luna, etc...\nThere are also small marinas that make up the Association of Marine Sports of Golfo Triste, which is made up: Marina El Ancla, Marina Las Canoas, Marina Puerto del Medio, Marina Indunave, Marina Costa Azul, Marina Embarcadero Morrocoy, Marina Caribe, Marina La Cazanga and Marina La Cuevita.\nThe piers house associations of boatmen who are dedicated to the transport of tourists to the various beaches of Morrocoy. Las luisas, Morrocoy and Aguasalobre are the piers in the area.\nAlso small stalls of cocadas, empanadas, coconut water and local crafts can be found.\n\n\n== Los Juanes ==\nLos Juanes belongs to Morrocoy National Park. It is also known as \"La Piscina\" (The Pool) because it is not sand beach, so the only access is the sea, a natural low where vacationers are able to enjoy its warm blue waters, always in time to the music bearing get the yachts moored in the shelter. It has a lot of vendors selling among other things, sea delicacies and cuisine accompanied by deep blue waters, lobster, ceviches, seafood, barbecue, drinks and even desserts. These are part of the services that can be found in Los Juanes and in some cases have outlets. There are some ice cream vendors to enjoy a nice dessert after a delicious seafood meal.\nVisiting Los Juanes may be done via a private boat or a small fishing boat, which will come to an area surrounded by mangroves where boats are anchored to enjoy of the sea. These boats can be taken from the same Morrocoy park or piers of Tucacas town.\nLos Juanes has two islands ideal for snorkeling due to their underwater fauna living among corals of various colors, mangroves and  shallow waters. They have become probably the most original and popular sites of all Morrocoy National Park.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Parque Nacional Morrocoy at Wikimedia Commons",

        "wiki": "Tamanaco was a native Venezuelan chief, who as leader of the Mariches and Quiriquires tribes led (during part of the 16th century) the resistance against the Spanish conquest of Venezuelan territory in the central region of the country, specially in the Caracas valley. He is one of the most famous and best known Venezuelan Caciques (Spanish: Indian chief).\nThe city of Santiago de Le\u00f3n de Caracas, which had been founded in 1567 by Diego de Losada, was continuously harassed and the subject of raids conducted by the local tribes. In 1570 when Diego de Mazariegos took charge as governor of the province of Venezuela, he made it a priority to pacify the territories.\nFollowing the death of Guaicaipuro, Tamanaco had risen as the new leader of the Mariches and Quiriquires. By 1573 Tamanaco and his group of natives had become such a problem that reinforcements came from Spain and other Spanish islands in the Caribbean with the sole purpose of taking care of this matter.\nSoon after captain Pedro Alonso Galeas and lieutenant Francisco Calder\u00f3n joined their forces, they started on an expedition with the intention of engaging Tamanaco and his men; they were helped by Aricabacuto, another native Chief.  Upon learning of this expedition, Tamanaco prepared a fighting force made up of 300 warriors recruited among his tribes and with the help of men from the Teques and Arbaco tribes. It wasn't long before the two groups engaged each other in combat. However neither side came out victorious in their first fight.\nSoon after Tamanaco decided to attack Caracas and pursue the Spanish soldiers who retreated to the banks of the river Guaire. The Spanish lost and their commanding officer captain Hernando de la Cerda died in the fighting. However, as the battle seemed to be ending with Tamanaco's victory, a Spanish cavalry detachment came and surrounded the natives.\nTamanaco was apprehended alive and sentenced to death by hanging. However, Garc\u00ed Gonz\u00e1lez de Silva, in charge of Caracas' city hall \"did something\". Among the discussion a captain named Mendoza suggested an alternative: he proposed to let Tamanaco chose between hanging or fighting a trained-killer mastin dog named \"Friend,\" that Mendoza owned. All liked the idea and proposed it to Tamanaco. He accepted the challenge and is reported to have said \"the dog will die by my hands and then these cruel men will know what Tamanaco is capable of\" However, the fight was uneven and Tamanaco died of the injuries he suffered in his throat. The legend claims the dog so fiercely bit his neck that it detached it from his body. Some historians say that there is not enough evidence to confirm if it was one or several dogs that fought with Tamanaco. After his death, Tamanaco would become a legend among the natives who would call his name when going into battle.\nIn Venezuela there are a variety of works, neighborhoods and sites that are named after Tamanaco. Probably best known are the 'Hotel Tamanaco'[1] (Caracas' oldest 5-star hotel\u2014part of the Intercontinental chain), the 'Centro Ciudad Comercial Tamanaco' (a shopping mall), the 'Tamanaco Avenue' in Caracas, the 'Colinas del Tamanaco' residential area in Caracas, and the 'Tamanaco Dam'[2] in Guarico state among others. Gold coins for investment and collection are minted in Venezuela with Tamanaco's image.\nIn past years the former president of Venezuela, deceased Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, has often mentioned Tamanaco and other native chiefs in his speeches with the purpose of inspiring Venezuelans to resist what he calls American imperialists and interventionists policies directed towards Venezuela. Most notably he did it every year during the 12 October holiday, which after being renamed several years ago Dia de la Raza (previously America's Discovery day), was recently renamed as D\u00eda de la Resistencia Ind\u00edgena (Day of Indigenous Resistance).\n\n\n== External links ==\nTamanaco biography (in Spanish)\nTamanaco gold coins\nHotel Tamanaco in Caracas\nCCCT Tamanaco Shopping Mall Website",

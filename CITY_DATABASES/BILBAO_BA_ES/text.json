        "wiki": "The Plaza Nueva or Plaza Barria (New Square) of Bilbao is a monumental square of Neoclassical style built in 1821. Its name comes from the previously existing Plaza Vieja or Old Square in the place where the Ribera Market was built. The square is enclosed by arcaded buildings and accessed by arches known as cuevas (caves). \nThe main building was the site of the Biscay government, until a new palace was built in 1890. The place is now the site of Euskaltzaindia, the Basque language Royal Academy.\nThe arches host many traditional taverns and restaurants, some of the most ancient and typical of the city, and some gift and souvenir shops. \nEach Sunday, the square provides space for a traditional flea market where ancient books, coins, stamps, birds and flowers are sold. \nThe square is used often for folk demonstrations, festivals and concerts. The Grand Slam Masters Final, one of the strongest chess tournaments in the world, was held in a glass structure on Plaza Nueva in 2008 and 2009.\nSince 2008, the City Council acts as a free ISP providing free Internet access via Wi-Fi in the square.",

          "The main building on the square is occupied by the Royal Basque language Academy. Try to pronounce its name Euskaltzaindia in Basque and you will understand that this language should be taught by an entire Academy. The other functional purpose of the square is no less clever.",

          "Recently stumbled upon this square on a Sunday, when a second hand bookmarket was on. It\u2019s a roofed square with restaurants round the edges, feels a bit like a tourist trap, though it\u2019s probably bound to be \u201cthe real thing\u201d.",
          "This beautiful square found in a maze of gsthic streets is a real hidden gem. The arcitecture itself is stunning but what makes this square a real find is the myriad of little tapas bars lining its wall. You could eat for days.delicious.",
          "Plaza Nueva is a beautiful square in the Old Town, it has a great selection of restaurants and places to grab some tapas and watch the world go by.",
          "Have lunch here after you visit the Guggenheim Museum. Nicer atmosphere than the Museum Cafe. And sit outside--weather permitting. We enjoyed our food and the view.",
          "A varied range of pintxos awaits you. Can get very busy in the evenings as finding tables around the cafes and bars can get a little tricky. Very family friendly as children are playing in the square whilst the parents are relaxing. On Sundays the plaza converts into a market",
          "Lovely to see many people enjoying themselves and gathering over drinks and small bites in this beautiful and lively plaza. All the restaurants around offer plentiful of pintxos and so many varieties. Can't wait to go back soon..",
          "Frankly Bilbao has much better to offer. This is a delightful city but Plaza Nueva seems to cater mainly to tourists and the locals that have captured the tables. Do we really want to hear a band playing \"Walk the Line\"?! The previous night we had enjoyed pintxos at a place",
          "On a Sunday it was very quite but the buildings very impressive decided to go again during the next week and it was busy with cafes open and lots of tourist tours",
          "Our tour group spent a pleasant half hour here, sampling food from the many tapas bars, listening to live music, and learning about the history of Bilbao from our guides.",
          "A colourful, vibrant square with lots of fab restaurants. Great if you're looking for Pinxtos and a glass of something.",
          "We went there in the evening to explore the bars. It was superb. Very lively and friendly. Excellent food and lovely atmosphere.",
          "This is just lovely, me saying old town square sounds a bit drab, but its not..Far from it, its big bright and beautiful, perfect for a coffee, a glass of wine, some pintxos, had a most amazing one here.",
          "Great place on either a Sunday morning, maybe with a coffee and cake in bar Bilbao or at night in the ever increasing number of new bars serving lovely tapas",
          "Its at night that this little place comes alive, lined with little bars serving pinxtos (Basque word for tapas I think) and spilling out into the cloisters. Choose a couple of bites and a drink from each one and you'd be full and a bit merry by the time you were galf way round!",
          "The square itself is very nice and there are a lot of pintxos bares and restaurants, in Bilbao pintxo rules !! (\"pinchos\" consist of small slices of bread upon which an ingredient or mixture of ingredients is placed and fastened with a toothpick, and they are delicious !!). Do",
          "We first came here on a Tuesday morning and enjoyed the silent atmosphere with a lovely sunrise. It was magnificent a great start to dive into lovely and lively old Town.",
          "It is a less spectacular version of the Plaza Mayor in Madrid. It is worth seeing if you are in the area, but not worth a special trip by itself.",
          "This is where everyone meets, the little cafes with there finger sized rolls are great, the food is out of this world",
          "Sleepy in the day time/morning but wow at night really busy ,full of locals having a good time Lots of pintxos bars really friendly Loved it",
          "A great city break location. This is a lovely square in the heart of the beautiful old town, but they could do more with it. You could easily miss it and it has lots of potential.",
          "We didn't even know it was here until we walked home from Baster (see review) and made a wrong turn. Steeped I history, what a great open square. You can feel the history of Spain in this area...take the time to breeze past.",
          "Sat in the lovely square at a Restaurant called Victor Montes, great service and amazing food and local wine recommended by our waiter",
          "This is the place to eat a few Pintxos, have a drink and sit around the plaza to watch locals and tourists alike. Be aware that Bilbainos meet here before they head off to lunch or dinner, so most of the bars will closed at 22:00.",
          "This is a starting or ending point for any visit to the Old City (Casco Viejo). Save some time to stay there and enjoy one of the restaurants and its \"pintxos\", to live a local experience.",
          "After 24 years not much has changed in the Plaza Nueva hidden away in the Casco Viejo. Still full of happy locals enjoying tapas and drinks before a late dinner. The biggest change is the quality and variety of tapas which are astoundingly good. An essential evening visit",
          "If you want a great place to go to drink, eat amazing food, soak up the atmosphere and just people watch then this is the place. (though there are no shortages of amazing places for the wandering foodie to enjoy)",
          "We spent three days in Bilbao, and most of the evenings we sauntered through Plaza Nueva. We are tapas/pintxos at a few restaurant in the Plaza. A pleasant place for people watching over a wine of sangria.",
          "Lovely part enclosed square, lined with bars and restaurants. Great place to watch the world go by while enjoying the local pinchos ( tapas)",
          "Kept returning to this delightful square. Samples some Pinxtos on a walkout one warm evening. Returned, twice, for great lunch at Victor Montes No 8",
          "Arriving at plaza nueva is only half a surprise after having walked through the rest of Bilbao's old town but it is still an amazing place, where all types of pinchos can be tried in all the available restaurants. Really an amazing small square in the old town.",
          "As in many city's in Spain, the plaza Nueva is a beating heart for the city. Bars whit the best pintos in the word surrounds the square. Here you'll find choice for every taste and age. The square itself is a meeting place for everybody. Children from al nationalities",
          "Nice, interesting square with good restaurants and many pintxos spots. But the only crowded, noisy and giving the impression of being full of tourists, area in Bilbao. You must go, but can eat elsewhere",
          "We tried the pintxos in a couple of the cafes and they were delicious. Very relaxed and laid back, loved it.",
          "I used to come here to play with my little brother back in the 1950s when we stayed with the abuelos (grandparents) so it was with some emotion that I walked round for the first time in 35 years. There are a number of excellent restaurants, including Victor Montes.",
          "Gorgeous square with a dozen or so pintxo bars. Excellent at meal-times. We happen to go late lunch which is when it is slightly less busy but the very noisy street cleaning vaccum thing goes round and round about 4-5, so avoid if possible,",
          "After walking around, we wanted to grab some bites. We walked around and had a glass of wine or two at the various bars. Musicians were playing. The sun was shining. It was a grand day for people watching. The outdoor dining was great. Many people would bar hop as we did.",
          "This Plaza in the old part of Bilbao has numerous bars/cafes including the Ahoan which has comfortable chairs and good waiter service.. Food is available at many outlets quite reasonably priced and it is difficult to decide where to eat.",
          "We came here and had a pintxos or two in one of the restaurants and just took some time out to look at this beautiful square.",
          "A little reminiscent of Rome or Barcelona, this is a beautiful plaza with arches, like a cloister. There are quite a few cafes and bars here offering pintxos. Some of the bars look very old indeed with beautiful historic frontages.",
          "The gastronomy and the basque pintxos are so tasty in the Plaza Nueva. We had a incredible pintxos and wine tour with walkingBizkaia. Nice experience with a local guide, Macarena. Very helpful girl!",
          "Plaza Nueva is surrounded by a number of bars most of which offer great Pintxos and beers. I prefer the Pintxos at La Olla (but they don't have terrace seating) or Zaharra which had a great atmosphere. During the summer on Sunday's you can catch a local market here in the",
          "Apart from the Africans selling stuff who are pretty harmless. You should watch out for groups of young people performing juggling acts and such like. While you are watching the act their mates are pickpocketing.",
          "Bilbao is small so very walkable. This plaza in the beautiful old town is surrounded by Pintxos bars so makes a rather nice place to stop, relax and take in the lovely scenery.",
          "The Plaza Nueva is truly a square. Our walking tour of the old town ended there and we had lunch. There are alot of nice places to eat or drink around the perimeter of the square. During and after lunch its very relaxing to sit around and people watch. A very nice break in",
          "Popular square in the old part of town,(Casco Viejo) the locals go out there for their pintxos and drinks on Fridays and Saturdays. Often concerts and other activities. pleasant terraces to sit outside if the weather permits. Mind the Sunday evenings, the place is deserted!",
          "Is a small plaza visited by locals mainly, is a good place to pass by and to have some snacks and beers before you go to a serious place for lunch",
          "Modern tapas gastro bars available, do not miss them. excellent quality and service specially in Gure Toki",
          "Classic square with great architecture. Good place to stop for a drink mid afternoon or stop to read a book.",
          "A good place to stop for a drink after strolling round the old town. The surrounding buildings are interesting and the square is surrounded by cafes and bars. There is an area for kids to run around in the middle of the square - no traffic. Surprisingly the bar where we stopped",
          "Lovely place hidden away from main thoroughfare very quiet and relaxing great place to stop off for a drink and a snack. Great choice of bars and cafes seems to attract alot of locals so that's s good sign",
          "Best area in Viejo Casco to go for drinks with friends. There is one particularly famous place, I forget the name but the pintxos looked amazing.",
          "Go have a walk ... get some ice cream, follow the crowd and take a left turn to the plaza Nueva. Here you will find a place that is just perfect to eat, dine, sit, talk, enjoy the sun, enjoy life.. watch kids play football, hear people chat, order some food and try to get that",
          "This large square is a good place for a drink or a meal and is in a good location net to the old town.",
          "This is a lovely area with lots of old architecture and quaint side lanes with bars and shops to cater for all budgets. The cleanliness is very high and conducive for lovely strolling. This area has the best Pintxos in Bilbao with friendly service. A visit to Bilbao is",
          "When we were there, there were just loads of kids playing football, adults having a drink, people having dinner. Lovely place to sit and enjoy an evening.",
          "There are historical and new restaurants to try in this square. You can tell which ones are worth trying by the lines of people outside the establishments, but peek in to see the pintxhos for yourself before you venture in.",
          "A very pleasant square with lovely architecture. Bars and restaurants, A Lovely place to sit and have a cool beer whilst watching the World go by",
          "Hidden under the columns there are ten plus Pinxtos cafe's from average to superb. on the plaze itself you can enjoy the drinks and snacks in the sun\u2026 sadly some beggars are persistent and keep you alert. A favorite hang out for local families in the weekend",
          "Not a great feel in early summer, somewhat quiet and run down and a square that isn't great enough to hold its own alone. Some good bars but generally what you expect in a tourist area such as this, fine but not outstanding.",
          "Live place to visit. Lots of caf\u00e9s around the square. Great to visit in the sunshine. Wonderful architecture.",
          "it's one of the typical plaza in spain, not particularly big. just a gathering or resting place near busy streets. you can easily pass by when visiting. so it's not a destination to go, but can visit when \"by the way\".",
          "Wonderful place in the evening to pass the time people watching. Great selection of food and wine to chose from",
          "Pleasant but has none of the vibrancy of the San Sebastian Plaza de la constituci\u00f3n. Good range of restaurants and bars.",
          "Beautiful setting Nice restaurants and bars A bit more touristy for me Preferred the bars / small tavernas in the surrounding streets An enjoyable experience nonetheless particularly at sunset",
          "It is a big Square in the Casco Viejo, old part of the city with amazing bars where you can taste the wonderful \"pintxos\", Vasque tapas. In the afternoons, it is the meeting point for families and there is a market on Sundays, philately, numismatics and birds.The arquitecture is",
          "This enclosed small square offers a quiet haven from the bustle of the casco viejo. It is lined with bars and restaurants, with open air seating. Interesting architecture.",
          "Victors is one of the oldest bars in the square and one of the best Do go inside beautiful black and white tiles and fabulous pintox",
          "Not worth a special trip but stop by if you need a drink or snack. Would not go out of my way to return though.",
          "Far from the most beautiful or memorable of plazas that I've come across in Spain, but Plaza Nueva had a great atmosphere when I went on a Saturday afternoon, partly supported by the football fans in many of the bars and restaurants. The food was good and not outrageously",
          "This is a must in Bilbao. It is one of the main places in the Casco Viejo. There are great restaurants so you can visit it during lunch or dinner and enjoy the food.",
          "This is a sizeable square with many seating areas around to sit and eat your shop bought lunch. Many restaurants and restaurant seating areas around the square and also a few bars and all selling pintxos. Nice to walk around and take a few photos. Close to St. Nicolas Church and",
          "Admittedly it was pouring down when we visited Plaza Nueva. It's ok. Some overpriced pintxos places. Felt a bit touristy. Far nicer places to eat than here. Beware of earlyish closing in Bilbao in the off season.",
          "A beautiful and well used square in the old part of the city famous and rightly so for its many bars selling good wine and pinchos. If you are in Bilbao you need to find it on the map and go to enjoy the architecture and gastronomy.",
          "Perhaps it was because we were here on a Sunday in April but the plaza was not only too quiet but very run down looking. Lots of trash strewn around and a general sense of decay. Kinda sad. Maybe it picks up when the weather gets better and more people are out?",
          "This is a large plaza in the center of Casco Viejo. Great for people watching or to have a nightcap..children playing with soccer with Dads",
          "We returned here lots during the weekend, in the day when sunny it's a great people watching place - lots of great food and wine. In the evening it's more of the same with a fun atmosphere.",
          "On our way to Casco Viejo, we dropped by to see this place and to have a drink and snacks in one of the many cafes and restaurants lining the plaza. It was a cold and rainy day in February, so we had to sit inside one of the cafes, which looked warm and inviting, with arrays of",
          "Lovely place to stop and have a drink or meal while visiting the old town, but not quite on the same scale as similar squares in Madrid and Barcelona.",
          "If you are in Casco Viejo, don't miss bars in Plaza Nueva. Plaza itself is nice, but not very impressive, but if you are there at night time, you can find couple really good bars with interesting pintxos there - definitely worth trying!",
          "We were wandering the Old Town looking for a coffee and spot of lunch whilst waiting for the town to reopen in the afternoon when we stumbled across this place. Very cute lots of choice for food and drink....nice place to pass an hour or two.",
          "Spent a great evening here going around the pinxto bars surrounding the square, the setting was beautiful and it's worth visiting during the day just to sit out and watch the world go by.",
          "Some great bars in a lovely square ,some really good value e.g. Bottle of superb basque white wine and six pintxios only 15 euros . We went in winter but could imagine how great in the summer months sitting outside , although the experience of the throng of people inside takes",
          "It was very busy, best location, nice cold beer and fried calamanis. A lovely view too. Absolutely enjoyed it!",
          "We included here with the Casco Antiguo and commented about the range of pincho bars here and the open door policy regardless how cold it may be in the winter months. Enjoy the architectural delights of this well preserved, traffic-free square.",
          "The Plaza was hard to enjoy when there was a huge marque being erected that covered pretty much of the square.",
          "No decent restaurants just scummy little cafes and bars. Loads of litter and really loud, area a real dive. No decent shops or anything of interest",
          "Great atmosphere. Must see pintxos bars. Great architecture. Sunday morning has a small market (not happy about the caged birds though)",
          "Visited on a Friday evening , was some sort of entertainment on in the centre and really noisy and not at all entertaining . Not really worth visit , full of tapas bars , but everybody breaths on the food as it sits on the bars , not for me thanks . Not really worth a visit .",
          "I visited the square in the afternoon and evening, such a contrast. Very buzzy atmosphere and enjoy a pinxtos whilst drinking a rioja and watch the people go buy.",
          "We went to find some great Pintxos and you could find them in every corner. Since is so good you'll find s looooot of people, but I think that's part of the experience!",
          "Beautiful architecture and you can't avoid this place if you roam around the old neighborhood. But there is little to do, so it's just something to see in passing.",
          "Accidentally stumbled across this. We had a coffee in one of the street cafes and spent an hour people watching.",
          "the plaza is surrendered by restauranst and bars displaying their amazing tapas. It feels as like as there is a sort of competition for making the most creative ones. Beautiful place and incredible atmosphere",
          "Great choice of bars offering fantastic pintxos. Great varieties of Spanish wines. Some excellent local ones and my favourites from the Douro.",
          "There are tapas bars and restaurants all around the square, we visited here more than once both during the day and evening. Day, mainly families and evening couples in the main. We never saw large groups of people, Good place to chill and in the centre of the old town where you",
          "A lot of pintxos and a lot of ca\u00f1as! Thats the best way to describe the heart of Casco Viejo. Just go there and don't be afraid to try the amazing food available.",
          "It was fine, i wouldn't bother my self to make plaza nueva as a first visit list. A lot another place to visit. However some of tapas bar worthy to try.",

          "Many choices and alternatives are available at the restaurants around the plaza, for all tastes and all budgets. Lively till late hours.",
          "Great area to hangout and have a few drinks and eats. You have several places to choose from and they are all good. Definitely recommend.",
          "Not as good as most Plazas in Big Spanish cities. In the shade in the morning. Worth a very quick walk, not even the best plaza in the city",
          "We walked over on a Friday evening and the whole square was bustling with activity. There were kids playing and having fun. The whole plaza is surrounded by lots of cafe's and bars to be able to relax and enjoy this wonderful outdoor space.",
          "Interesting arcaded square. I didn't eat there, but it would be a great place to sit--like a smaller St. Mark's Square in Venice.",
          "Cheap wine, excellent pintxos, and an atmosphere that makes it seem like everyone knows everyone. Had a lovely time!",
          "This square bathes in sun light during the day and is surrounded by a beautiful peristyle. A great place to go for coffee or have lunch with your friends.",
          "Plaza Nueva is situated just behind Hotel Arenal in the old town of Bilbao. The arcades around the plaza is full of bars and restaurants, with a rather hectic nightlife (but not specially late). The plaza is filled with outdoor tables belonging to the different bars. Here you",

          "Full of bars and little shops I would have like to have stayed longer but there was no time on our tour. I imagine it would be great in the evening.",
          "This is such a lovely place to sit, relax with a drink and watch the world go by. There are plenty of restaurants to drink at so there will be something you like. Sometimes there are things going on the square. Worth a visit.",
          "A great spot to take a break and have lunch in a beautiful historic square. I really enjoyed my time here.",

          "Set in the north of the old town this is a good place to relax and watch the world go by. It\u2019s a walled square with a covered walkway around the inside edges off which many bars and cafes provide refreshment. Many have outdoor seating and some have window service out to the",
          "Right in the centre of the old town, an enclosed square packed full of bars and restaurants. On Friday and Saturday evenings packed full of people with the centre aura full of kids playing . Trawl the Pintxos bars or just sit outside a cafe/bar and people watch. Not the",
          "The remodeling and redirection of this old wine warehouse in the town center is both interesting and novelle. Multi usage by many was the goal and it has been achieved. Restaurant, gym, library, theater, exposition center. A redirection of an old asset gives vital new life.",
          "If you want to do as the locals do head to this square In the old town at night. The square is surrounded by bars and restaurants with indoor , undercover and outside seating. It's buzzing at night with local children playing in the middle of the square and people chatting,",

          "We came here every evening on our Bilbao stay because we liked it so much. Usually we try a number of areas but there is a great selection of bars and pintxos places around the edge of this plaza in the Casco Viejo (old town). To find it, you's probably need a map or Google",
          "Pretty buildings but not a place to sit and relax. Dogs and pigeons and kids running wild. We visited on a Thursday evening in August so perhaps it's a more relaxing place for a drink at other times. But during our visit the bars were overcrowded, the toilets were filthy (as was",
          "A must-see in Bilbao and a nice place to stay. Of course, after having put the Guggenheim museum on your bucketlist. The plaza has different smaller pubs where they serve excellent tapa's.",

          "A good example of the plazas of Spain. By day they are enjoyed by everyone at night they are crowded by Spaniards and tourists alike enjoying food, drink and conversation. There should be more of them worldwide",

          "There are tapas bars to get a drink and a bite to eat which are quite good. One of the nicest parts was watching the children playing in the square with parents and grandparents looking on. It was a nice change from the much more touristy Plazas in Madrid and Barcelona. I",

          "I didn't find anything particularly special about this plaza, but I also don't know much about it. It seemed like many other plazas I've seen in Spain and the food seemed a bit touristy.",
          "The building is of Neoclassicism, which if you know the era you would appreciate it. It is quit simple but very functional. It meets it's function when it was build then.",
          "Arrived early evening and the square was quite busy with lots of bars. Not as stunning as anticipated but nice nevertheless. Service was again, ok, but not as friendly as other bars in less of a tourist trap. Overall the old town is great, and plenty of places to go. Worth a",

          "We relaxed for a while before heading out to find food for teenage family (who weren't into eating pinchos). Would have been nice to stay and eat in the Plaza though as plenty of wonderful looking restaurants serving pinchos all around the perimeter.",
          "We drank and eat in 3 of the bars lining the square. The locals tend to sit and chat over a glass of wine whilst the kids play in the centre of the square. Plenty of things going on with a number of entertainers some god and some just a painful, but with so much choice in such a",
          "This is one of those quintessential old Spanish squares, surrounded by bars and restaurants, which all have tables and chairs outside. We got there about 7.30 in the evening,before the main dinner rush, and were sitting with glasses of wine, watching the local kids running",

          "Although we were only in Bilbao for 2 nights we must have eaten in 3 of the Pintxos bars around the square, on at least 5 occasions. What we really liked was the centre of the square was really being used by locals, with lots of kids playing watched by their families.",
          "What can you say? It's a typical plaza major with loads of nice bars and cheapish restaurants around the outside. When we were there we had some nice reggae music coming from the stage in the centre. We should have one of these in Manchester!",
          "It was an amazing experience. The visit to Plaza Nueva was a little short but intense for shopping secondhand pieces and to take a pair of \"tapas y ca\u00f1as\". They had few bars but the atmosphere was excellent coinciding with the gay pride!!!!",
          "The Plaza Nueva is near the Old Quarter and filled with shops, bars and restaurants. Bilbao is decidedly different from the two big cities we just visited - Madrid and Barcelona - but charming and much more laid back. We wandered around the Casco Viejo, then wandered in here",

          "Great place to chill out and do a bit of people watching. Plenty of bars with good value deals for a beer or wine with a selection of delicious pintxos",
          "some interesting facades and 2 disappointing museums on this square and the metro station. other than a caf\u00e9 there really is nothing much here to see",
          "Plaza Nueva is the central square with arcades in Casco Viejo. Coming from the 7 streets it's difficult to find, but from Calle Arenal it is only 100 meters away. It's more of a large courtyard, completely enclosed by buildings. On the ground floor of these buildings are many",

          "I have walked through the Plaza Nueva a few times and found it, as you would expect, fairly crowded with locals and tourists. The many bars there were buzzing and the pintxos served are OK however there may be better areas to visit for these. The architecture is interesting",
          "The architecture and structure is not as fascinating or detailed as most Spanish plazas. When we were there, yelling kids filled the square. There are pintxo establishments along the sides of the square, including one called Sorginzulo, that had a delicious fois and ox burger",

          "At the recommendation of a colleague, we opted for dinner here when we discovered that our first choice of restaurants was closed for the day. If you only have a passing familiarity with Pintxos, the restaurants and bars that ring this old plaza offer a graduate course worthy of",
          "It's nice place with a lots of things to see and do lots of activities and restaurants to chose. We liked the cleanses and good food and the security we had it's just was a bit far from where we were",

          "Wow! This place is fantastic morning, noon and night. During the day sip a cool smoothie or treat yourself to an amazing Oreo latte from the coffee shop in the corner, whilst sunning yourself and watching the local community have fun. At night drink red or white Basque wines and",

          "I specially advise people to go there on Sundays (approx. 10 am to 2 pm) to see the local market when they sell old books, coins, stamps and pets. It's also very funny to see all the kids and specially their parents trading cards... Dislikes? Bars here are usually more expensive.",
          "Lovely old square - 'new' in that it is nineteenth century while the streets around are rather older. Lots of great restaurants for lunch or dinner",
          "This is a great place to walk around, check out the menus being offered at all the restaurants, pick one, sit back, relax, and enjoy. Have a cold beer or a glass of wine while enjoying a meal or a great variety of pintxos. This is a great spot for people watching.",
          "This is the pleace to be for the best pinxtos of the town. It starts at about 13:00 h. Just swap from one bar to another, but end at Victor's. [a senior couple from amsterdam]",
          "Well worth a lunch time look and sample the tapas in the Victor Montes and others. The only problem throughout the old quarter is the beggars who have free range if you sit on an outside table",
          "Beautifull square with many arches and many many tapasbars. The most famous (and also most expensive) is Victor Montes, a very old cafe/restaurant. In the evening the square is full of locals and some tourists.",
          "I never visited when the markets were on, but we had coffee there on the morning of our departure and it was nothing compared to going at night, when the lights are on and the square is crowded with people are drinking wine and eating Pintxos. This was one of our most favourite",
          "Make your way here, loads of restaurants and Pinxto bars. We visited during the big week so the place was thronged with dancers and music and festivities which made it even better. Easy to find and great intro to the old town.",
          "Slightly tricky to find but this square is worth the hunt. Good bars and restaurants abound with music, laughter and chatter together with beautiful traditional Spanish architecture. Not particularly \"touristy\" either - hooray!!",
          "The rest of Spain calls them Tapas, but here they are called Pintxos, and the are superb. Great variety, wonderful combinations, lovingly prepared. My favourite was the Gilda. See if you can locate the Champion Gilda Bar, I did!",
          "There is a sameness to all the main 'Plaza's' across Spain, but this was a nice place to end up after walking through Bilbao's old town. Lots of choice of nice places serving beer and Pintxos.",

          "We ate in this beautiful square twice, and always seemed to end up back in it for a drink. The stunning architecture and lively atmosphere are not to be missed. It is dotted with bars and eateries but is slightly more pricey than the famous old town because of what you sit in.",
          "This square reminded me of the one in Vitoria. Cute caf\u00e9s around, children running around in the middle of it. Have a pintxo (or two) in one of the places around this square, they say that the best tasting pintxos in Bilbao can be found in there.",
          "Nice square, there is one in every town in Spain. We sat and had a coffee/glass of wine at one of the coffee shops. The touristic brochure recommended Victor but it opened quite late so we had a couple of tapas at the bar, which was ok, and then moved to SORGLNGULO in Plaza",

          "One must have done it once. But while sitting outside eating pinxos and dinking txacoli can become expensive. Beter is not to sit outside but inside around the bar and take the pinxos that one can see and pay immediately. Inside the inkfish was amazing for only 8 euro's.",

It was designed by French designer Philippe Starck in collaboration with Thibaut Mathieu and was opened to the public in stages between 18 May and 24 October 2010. The venue, labeled as a \"Culture and Leisure Centre\", consist of a cinema multiplex, a fitness centre, a library, showrooms, an auditorium, shops, and a restaurant. In March 2015 its name was officially changed to Azkuna Zentroa in tribute to the late mayor of Bilbao I\u00f1aki Azkuna.Originally a corn exchange (alh\u00f3ndiga in Spanish), it was designed by Basque architect Ricardo Bastida and inaugurated in 1909. However, in the 1970s, a new warehouse was planned and the Alh\u00f3ndiga was abandoned. Several projects were suggested, ranging from public housing, a museum of modern art, or even demolishing the entire building, but all were scrapped. Finally, in 1994 it was decided to renovate it and build a sports and culture centre. The Basque Government decided to declare the building \"Public Property of Cultural Interest\" in 1999.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in English, Spanish, and Basque)\nOfficial YouTube channel (in Spanish)\nelcorreo.com special about the Alh\u00f3ndiga (in Spanish)\nelcorreo.com special about the project (in Spanish)",

        "wiki": "The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao is a museum of modern and contemporary art designed by Canadian-American architect Frank Gehry, and located in Bilbao, Basque Country, Spain. The museum was inaugurated on 18 October 1997 by King Juan Carlos I of Spain, with an exhibition of 250 contemporary works of art. Built alongside the Nervion River, which runs through the city of Bilbao to the Cantabrian Sea, it is one of several museums belonging to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation and features permanent and visiting exhibits of works by Spanish and international artists. It is one of the longest museums in Spain.\nOne of the most admired works of contemporary architecture, the building has been hailed as a \"signal moment in the architectural culture\", because it represents \"one of those rare moments when critics, academics, and the general public were all completely united about something\", according to architectural critic Paul Goldberger. The museum was the building most frequently named as one of the  most important works completed since 1980 in the 2010 World Architecture Survey among architecture experts.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1991, the Basque government suggested to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation that it would fund a Guggenheim museum to be built in Bilbao's decrepit port area, once the city's main source of income. The Basque government agreed to cover the US$100 million construction cost, to create a US$50 million acquisitions fund, to pay a one-time US$20 million fee to the Guggenheim and to subsidize the museum's US$12 million annual budget. In exchange, the Foundation agreed to manage the institution, rotate parts of its permanent collection through the Bilbao museum and organize temporary exhibitions.The museum was built by Ferrovial, at a cost of US$89 million.  About 5,000 residents of Bilbao attended a preopening extravaganza outside the museum on the night preceding the official opening, featuring an outdoor light show and concerts. On 18 October 1997 the museum was opened by Juan Carlos I of Spain.\n\n\n== Building ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nThe Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation selected Frank Gehry as the architect, and its director, Thomas Krens, encouraged him to design something daring and innovative.  The curves on the exterior of the building were intended to appear random; the architect said that \"the randomness of the curves are designed to catch the light\". The interior \"is designed around a large, light-filled atrium with views of Bilbao's estuary and the surrounding hills of the Basque country\". The atrium, which Gehry nicknamed The Flower because of its shape, serves as the organizing center of the museum.When the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao opened to the public in 1997, it was immediately hailed as one of the world's most spectacular buildings in the style of Deconstructivism (although Gehry does not associate himself with that architectural movement), a masterpiece of the 20th century. Architect Philip Johnson described it as \"the greatest building of our time\", while critic Calvin Tomkins, in The New Yorker, characterized it as \"a fantastic dream ship of undulating form in a cloak of titanium,\" its brilliantly reflective panels also reminiscent of fish scales. Herbert Muschamp praised its \"mercurial brilliance\" in The New York Times Magazine.  The Independent calls the museum \"an astonishing architectural feat\".\n\nThe museum is seamlessly integrated into the urban context, unfolding its interconnecting shapes of stone, glass and titanium on a 32,500-square-meter (350,000 sq ft) site along the Nervi\u00f3n River in the ancient industrial heart of the city; while modest from street level, it is most impressive when viewed from the river. With a total 24,000 m2 (260,000 sq ft), of which 11,000 m2 (120,000 sq ft) are dedicated to exhibition space, it had more exhibition space than the three Guggenheim collections in New York and Venice combined at that time. The 11,000 m2 of exhibition space are distributed over nineteen galleries, ten of which follow a classic orthogonal plan that can be identified from the exterior by their stone finishes. The remaining nine galleries are irregularly shaped and can be identified from the outside by their swirling organic forms and titanium cladding.  The largest gallery measures 30 meters wide and 130 meters long (98 ft \u00d7 427 ft). In 2005, it housed Richard Serra's monumental installation The Matter of Time, which Robert Hughes dubbed \"courageous and sublime\".The building was constructed on time and budget, which is rare for architecture of this type. In an interview in Harvard Design Magazine, Gehry explained how he did it. First, he ensured that what he calls the \"organization of the artist\" prevailed during construction, to prevent political and business interests from interfering with the design. Second, he made sure he had a detailed and realistic cost estimate before proceeding. Third, he used computer visualizations produced by Rick Smith employing Dassault Systemes' CATIA V3 software and collaborated closely with the individual building trades to control costs during construction.\nKLM Royal Dutch Airlines donated $1,000,000 towards its construction.\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nThis museum is a colossal construction, which used more than 25,000 tons of concrete, or 10,000 cubic meters, that is why it requires deep and solid foundations. The foundation was laid on reinforced concrete piles driven into the bedrock at an average depth of 14 meters.The building is based in the clay of the bed of the nearby river \u201cRia de Bilbao\u201d; therefore, it was necessary to implant piles in large numbers, driven into the ground by many boring machines. In total, 665 pilings were driven to anchor the building to the ground.\n\n\n=== Cladding ===\nThe base of the building is covered with beige limestone from the Hu\u00e9scar quarries near Granada, cut from 5 cm thick slabs. The building is clear thanks to the walls, specially treated to protect the interior from the effects of the sun. The glass of the windows has also been treated to prevent light from damaging the exposed pieces.\nIt is clad in titanium plates, arranged in scales, on a galvanized steel structure. The Museum's exterior skin is made of 33,000 titanium plates, a material that has been used to replace copper or lead because of their toxicity. Many tests have been carried out with different materials to find one that would withstand heat and bad weather, while maintaining its character. It was during this research process that tests were started on titanium samples and the best treatment was found.\nIts lamination process is delicate and has to be done in places with high energy sources, that's why the laminated parts were made in Pittsburgh, in the United States, the rolling allowed to obtain titanium plates only 0.4mm thick, which is much thinner than if we had to use steel plates. Moreover, titanium is about half the weight of steel, indeed, the museum's titanium coating represents only 60 tons.\nDuring the conception, the pieces were designed to resist the bad weather, that is why a quilted rather than undulated shape was privileged, to resist the wind, and to avoid vibrations during storms.\nTitanium is a low-polluting material, and each part has been designed differently according to its orientation on the building, so they correspond perfectly with the curves desired by Frank Gehry.\n\n\n== Virtual Building ==\nIn the fall of 1993, architects at Gehry Partners began to utilize Dassault Systemes' CATIA software for the schematic design phase of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao to digitize and model the exterior of the Museum project. Essentially, this software calculates point by point the stresses to which materials are subjected, by generating a 3D model showing the different tensions and allowing the values of many structural elements of the museum to be calculated: the steel structure, titanium cladding or foundations, among others. It also helped to automate the cutting of materials such as stone or titanium plates.\nThe architects applied Master Modeling and Virtual Build Processes they learned from Rick Smith and his use of the same techniques on the Walt Disney Concert Hall during the previous two years. The success and global awareness of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao ushered in a new era of Virtual Building and was a catalyst for what would become popularly known as Building Information Modeling seven years later.\nPulitzer prize winning architectural critic Paul Goldberger shares the words of others that Bilbao \"could not have been constructed without CATIA\". He further relays that Bilbao \"was the first building for which CATIA played a role in almost every aspect of the design and construction process\".\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nThe museum notably houses \"large-scale, site-specific works and installations by contemporary artists\", such as Richard Serra's 100-meter-long (340 ft) Snake, and displays the work of Basque artists, \"as well as housing a selection of works\" from the Foundation's modern art collection.  In 1997, the museum opened with \"The Guggenheim Museums and the Art of This Century\", a 300-piece overview of 20th-century art from Cubism to new media art. Most pieces came from the Guggenheim's permanent collection, but the museum also acquired paintings by Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still and commissioned new works by Francesco Clemente, Anselm Kiefer, Jenny Holzer and Richard Serra.The exhibitions change often; the museum generally hosts thematic exhibitions, centered for example on Chinese or Russian art.  Traditional paintings and sculptures are a minority compared to installations and electronic forms.  The highlight of the collection, and its only permanent exhibit, is The Matter of Time (incorporating an earlier work, Snake), a series of weathering steel sculptures designed by Serra, which is housed in the 130-meter Arcelor Gallery (formerly known as the Fish Gallery but renamed in 2005 for the steel manufacturer that sponsored the project).  The collections usually highlight Avant-garde art, 20th century abstraction, and non-objective art.  When the museum announced the 2011 exhibition \"The Luminous Interval\", a show of artwork belonging to Greek businessman Dimitris Daskalopoulos, who is also a museum trustee, this met with criticism of, among other things, too much curatorial power for a serious benefactor. In 2005, Olivier Berggruen and Ingrid Pfeiffer curated a retrospective of Yves Klein.\nIn 2012 David Hockney's exhibition  drew over 290,000 visitors to the museum.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economic and media impact ==\nThe museum was opened as part of a revitalization effort for the city of Bilbao. Almost immediately after its opening, the Guggenheim Bilbao became a popular tourist attraction, drawing visitors from around the globe. In its first three years, almost 4 million tourists visited the museum, helping to generate about \u20ac500 million in economic activity. The regional council estimated that the money visitors spent on hotels, restaurants, shops and transport allowed it to collect \u20ac100 million in taxes, which more than paid for the building cost.\n\nThe building was featured in the 1999 James Bond film The World Is Not Enough in the pre-title sequence and the Tamil film Sivaji (2007), in which it is the setting for the music video of the song \"Style\", composed by A. R. Rahman.  Mariah Carey's music video \"Sweetheart\", directed by Hype Williams, shows singers Jermaine Dupri and Carey in various locations at the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nThe so-called \"Bilbao effect\" refers to how the museum transformed the city. The term, however, has also been employed by critics who have denounced the museum as a symbol of gentrification and cultural imperialism. The Wall Street Journal suggested that the Bilbao effect should be called the Bilbao anomaly, \"for the iconic chemistry between the design of building, its image and the public turns out to be rather rare.\"Art critic Brian O'Doherty was positive about approaching the building but criticized the museum's interior effect, saying \"[O]nce you get indoors things are a little different. Even the so-called site-specific works didn't look too happy to me. Most of the interior spaces are too vast.\" He went on to describe how works by Braque, Picasso and Rodchenko \"looked absurd\" and tiny on the museum's walls.\n\n\n== Management and 2007 embezzlement incident ==\nAccording to a report issued in 2007 by the Basque Court of Auditors, the museum paid more than US$27 million for the acquisition of art between 2002 and 2005, including Serra's The Matter of Time for the cavernous ground-floor gallery. After another audit in 2008 revealed that money was missing from accounts, the Foundation said that it filed a case against the director, Roberto Cearsolo Barrenetxea, \"for financial and accounting irregularities\", asserting that he had admitted diverting money from two companies that manage the Guggenheim Bilbao building and its art collection to his own account since 1998.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nWorld Architecture Survey\n12 Treasures of Spain\nGuggenheim family\nThe Globalized City, a publication doing case studies on the museum as a large scale development project\nList of Guggenheim Museums\n\n\n== References ==\n\nCuito, Aurora, Pons, Eugeni, Guggenheim, 2001.\nGuggenheim Bilbao, 2000, Connaissance des Arts (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Promotion Artistique) ; no. especial.\nSullivan, Edward J, Calvo Serraller, Francisco, Hunter, Sam, Forma eta figurazioa : Blake-Purnell bildumako maisu-lanak : [erakusketa, Guggenheim Bilbao Museoa], Museo Guggenheim Bilbao, 1998.\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nScholars on Bilbao - academic works that analyse Bilbao's urban regeneration\nGuggenheim Museum Bilbao - Project for Public Spaces Hall of Shame\nPictures of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao\nGuggenheim Museum in an artistic short movie\nBilbao.

          "The museum may not be a Prado or a Louvre but it is not too large as to b overwhelming. I visited it with my family and the exhibit they had at the time was quite awe inspiring. Don't forget to see the exhibits on the other wing of the building. The museum obviously provokes",
          "Really liked the way the art was organized so you weren't taking in the same style of art for several rooms. Appreciated not having to view a whole room of a certain style or certain painter. Found myself much more engaged than usual. Thought by the end of my wanderings I had",
          "The great thing about the Bilbao Fine Arts Museum is that it isn\u2019t the Guggenheim\u2014in terms of both the building and the contents. Both Bilbao residents and visitors alike get to enjoy two really great/unique museums and neither collection should be missed. The Bilbao Fine Arts",
          "Interesting way to organise art - alphabetically. A wonderful collection of a wide range of art, old and new, side by side. The Zuloaga exhibition was an added bonus. Just a short walk from the Guggenheim & definitely worth including in your itinerary.",
          "We went to the main exhibit which is free after 6pm. The art is organized by theme and not artist, style and time period. Liked it.",
          "The idea of showing Spanish works of art is very good but the really famous works of art are not shown here. Bilbao closes all of its shops and many of the restaurants so there really isnt much to visit. Visiting this museum is a good idea.",
          "The permanent collection is arranged by themes which make it quite different from most other museums.",
          "Some great pieces of super art here, along with some usual weird stuff. Enjoyed this more than Guggenheim though.",
          "Fabulous collection of work by mostly Spanish artists. Loved the way the permanent collection was organized alphabetically with each letter representing a theme, such as D for desire, F for friendship, J for Japon, W for war, etc. Interesting approach that provides an eclectic",
          "I stumbled across this lovely little gallery completely by accident, it was the only touristy thing I could find open on a Monday. It is not as illustrious as its big neighbour, The Guggenheim, but it is a really enjoyable little gallery to while away a couple of hours.",
          "Current ABC exhibit is a wonderful way to view art by theme. Also currently being shown is a comprehensive collection by Ignacio Zuloaga.",
          "Doesnt open on Tuesdays. Mostly 20th century art. From famous ones we have only seen El Greco and De Goya. Worth a visit I think if you have time, but NOT a must. The museum is fairly small. It has an awesome concept of A-Z which you will discover. The art is not organised in",
          "Get the dual ticket which gives you access to here and the guggenheim. Some amazing El greco paintings and really well laid out.",
          "First time limited time visit. Saw the \u2018The alphabet of the Bilbao Museum\u2019 exhibit. As a novice art viewer, I found this exhibit very informative. I recommend seeing this exhibit.",
          "Just head to the back to the Spanish painters. Lovely grouping. Otherwise nothing too unusual. The building is beautiful.",
          "The building is pretty boring compared with the Guggenheim. However the works it contains are interesting. I saw the ABC exhibit which had a wide variety of interesting art. Cafe is quite small. Some of the rooms were over-crowded. However I did visit on the Free Museum Day when",
          "After El Prado, the second best classic art museum in Spain, you can not miss Goya's 'aquafortes'. The permanente exhibition worths the visit but the temporary ones are usually even better",
          "A modern addition has been joined to the old fine arts museum, vastly increasing its exhibition space. The current exhibition - art objects from the museum's collection grouped thematically by alphabet - is both ingenious and interesting.",
          "The initiative was given to author Kirmen Uribe to create the ABC exhibition based on words referring to all the letters of the alphabet. He went through the museums collections of paintings, drawings, sculptures and miscellanous artefacts with open eyes and chose what to put on",
          "Lovely building not far from the park and centre. It looks small on the outside, but you will need around 1.5. - 2 hrs to see it all properly. The rooms are fairly light and airy and the art from different periods is grouped together in alphabetical fashion by subject, so",
          "Went to Guggenheim,waste of time! Came here much better.This is art not pretentious rubbish.Some famous names amongst them. Didn't feel we had wasted our time and money.",
          "Very pleasant gallery with an interesting 110th anniversary exhibition themed unconventionally by the alphabet. Some interesting choices, well hung. The audioguide meanders around topics eventually getting to the artworks on view. Very long-winded for a gallery that provides few",
          "There are some very nice sculptures here from Chillida, Larrea. The current exhibition is also interesting. Quite nice presentation. Worth to spend a couple of hours here.",
          "The A \u2013 Z alignment of the rooms is an interesting concept. The exhibits are well chosen and make your visit worthwhile. At \u20ac10 it is not overpriced.",
          "Nice that it is free under 25. The abc exhibit was an interesting way of showing the collection! The art on diaplay was varied and worth it. The audioguide is also quite nice.",
          "The permanent collection is now housed in the old building and is arranged rather eccentrically. However, there is loads of interesting stuff. Exhibitions of particular Basque emphasis in the new building. Good cafe, situated in a gorgeous park.",
          "This gallery has turned its back on the traditional chronological approach and organised its collection around alphabetic themes. This works well in some cases, such as portraits, when you can study the different styles side by side. Some, however, are a bit disappointing",
          "The curating is stunning. Each room is a letter of the alphabet (and somehow we get more than 26 in The Basque language) and has a name eg, death, rain, iron, dream. And in each room all types and ages of art and sculptures jostle with each other to tell their own story. It",
          "A nice museum with a good idea of showing the art A-Z, e.g. B=blue, so all Pictures and other art with blue etc.",
          "It\u2019s a good eclectic mix of various modern and old masters all with various connections back to the Basque region. The audio guide is very good.Open on a Sunday so good to combine with the Guggenheim Museum as it\u2019s walking distance.",
          "This is a fine building housing a fascinating array of paintings and sculptures from a number of previous centuries. I particularly liked the Manuel Losada 'Los Remeros' which reminded me of a painting by the French impressionist Caillebotte. You need to spend at least an hour",
          "A beautiful visit with a truly unique exhibition. The ABC Collection presents the paintings in a complete new context. More or less useless without an Audioguide, because the stories, why the paintings are attached to a letter and word are quite important to understand the 31",
          "The museum showed a selection of Art according to words in an alphabetical order: This allows for a completely new way of contemplating art!",
          "We expected a small museum and were very surprised to find a riveting exhibit of the alphabet and art related to the words beginning of each letter. We spent hours there !",
          "Well laid out and a slightly differnt take on most similar museums due to th mix f new andd old in th saame rooms",
          "On my visit there was an exhibition going through art from A to Z (including a few letters I am less familiar with such as ll, tz, etc). I've not seen an exhibition like that in my life and I found it a great way to present a range of works (rather than the usual by period or",
          "A must see Museum which houses a stunning collection of art. The Guggenheim is externally beautiful but this Museum matches it for it's Art collection",
          "I enjoyed the museum during the free 6-8pm window, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The selection of art was broad enough for visitors to identify with at least one piece there. The building and surrounding area is a work of art in and of itself. It's small, so you can get through",
          "We liked the idea of grouping art from different artists around one theme/word. Beautiful pieces of classic painting and some delightful modern pieces also. Certainly worth a visit! And the entrance hall... we are not even now sure about the scrap there... they may be",
          "This museum is within walking distance of other attractions and contains some really beautiful pieces of art. The rooms are categorised by a letter of the alphabet, the word starting with that letter is the main theme of the art found in that room. This makes it a little",
          "It seemed that half of this museum was closed undergoing renovation when I was there, but there is a good exhibition of some of their collection on there at present. They have some nice pieces of art, but one felt it was totally overshadowed by the Guggenheim, which is just up",
          "The original presentation of their collection by theme following the alphabet is phenomenal: some themes were mom, rain, colorful, war, all with surprising and extremely well done associations of old and contemporary pieces...amazing! With this presentation, We discover art we",
          "This is a spectacular place. Go and see for yourself. Very well curated. All in all a great place to look at art, consider the overall meaning and enjoy the surroundings.",
          "The idea of having rooms according to letters of the alphabet makes for strange curation, ie Room P for Portraits, M for mothers, etc.. I never knew when i was going to come across a Goya or a Gaugain. But an immense variety of wonderful tableaux, many by Basques artists",
          "We like the way the exhibit is organized by topics from A to Z. Good opportunity to learn more of the region",
          "These are the three not to be missed. We loved the Bellas Artes Museum - in particular because it is open on Mondays - and proved to be a worthy competitor to the Guggenheim. The \u00abalphabet\u00bb collection was fascinating -",
          "Bilbao Fine Arts Museum (Museo de Bellas Artes) is a compact, well curated museum that has a charming combination of international masters and local not-to-famous painters and sculptors. During our visit, the collection was exhibited in an ingenious way from A to Z with themed",
          "This is a lovely Museum with an eclectic and impressive Art collection. This Museum is one of the finest Art Museums in Spain. Mandatory for any lover of Fine Art.",
          "Lovely museum. Can be visited in less than two hours. Loved the exhibition set up by alphabet. Less crowded than the Guggenheim. But do visit both.",
          "Great modern as well as classical paintings. Exhibits rotate, so each visit has been totally different. Turned a corner and gasped at the sight of El Greco paintings. Totally recommend not missing this wonderful little treasure. Great gift shop, too!",
          "Well normally I frequent classic art museums such as Musee D'Orsay in Paris or the Louvre but recently I ventured into the Guggenheim Museum in San Sebastian. On display was a large range if works by Picasso and other well known modern including Monet and other French",
          "Choosing the alphabet based themes, then the paintings to match is very creative in itself. The museum is well laid out and a bargain with free loan of audio guide thrown in. As it is also open on a Monday, ideal place to go as the Guggenheim is closed.",
          "All of the exhibits were grouped according to theme (quiet, plants) and placed in rooms in Alphabetical order which was interesting; mainly by Spanish artists, just the right size-not too big, not too small. Great gift shop-they could print on canvas your choice of painting from",
          "Each room has a theme based on a word beginning with each letter of the alphabet. In combining various art styles with that theme in the same room, I found myself looking at EVERYTHING, rather than passing by art that inevitably becomes monotonous after you've visited room after",
          "The museum is much well know than the Guggenheim or some other art museums in Spain, and with reason. They have rather average collection of art, mostly by local artists, but a few pieces stick out and are worthwhile seeing. The museum recently reopened with a whole new concept.",
          "This is a more \"relaxed\" museum than the Guggenheim. I did not really expect much from it, but we were certainly surprised and amazed by what we saw here. This really is a must see if you want to enjoy Basque culture.",
          "This is a must see when visiting Bilbao. Incredible museum and art work that will take your breath away. The building it's self is increadable.",
          "Everyone comes for the Guggenheim, but this museum\u2019s exhibit around concepts from A to Z (all 31 Spanish letters) is easily among the most sophisticated exhibits my wife and I have ever seen. We spent 3 1/2 hours ( including a lovely pinxtos lunch) fully engrossed. The art work",
          "There isn't room to comment on the exhibits. The exhibition currently on display is the A B C of art. Taking each letter to illustrate a theme for the room, and then showing pictures of a subject that was appropriate to the theme. Worth the visit, no crowds,",
          "In Bilbao, there is nothing better to do before dinner than go to the Fine Arts Museum at 6 PM, when admission becomes free. The collection has fine paintings from the masters generally, and a large collection of the work of Basque artists. A must if you want to enjoy Basque",
          "So 99% of tourists come to Bilbao and see the Guggenheim and there\u2019s nowt wrong with that. I suspect the proportion of visitors to this lovely city who come to the Fine Arts Museum is a little lower and thank the lord for that. In any other mid sized city people would rave about",
          "We went during the free daily 6pm-8pm session and enjoyed a thoroughly interesting visit to the exhibition which only reopened the day before. We really enjoyed the alphabetic themed layout as it made us look at all sorts of art on one room. There is something for everyone",
          "On 6 October 2018 a new exhibition opened at Bilbao Fine Arts Museum. It will continue into the middle of 2019 and so should not be missed if you are visiting Bilbao. Having already visited the Guggenheim earlier in the day, it was a joy to enter this tranquil museum and to",
          "the exhibits were well laid out and easy to follow with the audio guide (after they sorted ours out) .Quality of exhibition was tremendous",
          "this is hard because next to the Guggenheim this is a 30 m tour to see great art but such you can see in most big cities around the globe. where as the Guggenheim is a place you should travel to now just to see and feel.",
          "Good value at 10 euros per person (with a free hardback book thrown in for good measure). Eclectic mix of styles with a couple of old masters (an El Greco and some stunning 15th and 16th century originals) with a smattering of Guaguin, Bacon and some nice modern sculpture. Good",
          "Interesting way of arranging the collection, but the collection doesn't really challenge and I should a bit 'samey' for want of a better word. As displayed it's not really fine arts as there is little sculpture and next to no photography. As another reviewer said, there isn't",
          "Even if you go just to see the architecture of the building, your trip will be worth it. The building design is incredibly impressive. The art work inside, just as much so. Great day trip into Bilbao to see the museum.",
          "The main attraction of the museum was billed as 110 exhibits to mark the 110 years since the museum was opened. There was a comprehensive audio guide to accompany this in English. Unfortunately I found many of the exhibits (mostly paintings) to be unexceptional. Most of the rest",
          "Wish I had read the website! Missed seeing this. The surrounding grounds are lovely, though. They have an outside display to help compensate would-be visitors.",
          "Oldest museum in Bilbao. Did you know it was the first council museum in Spain? The former El Prado museum manager is now running it. (His father was the previous manager)...",
          "Nice local fine art museum with a representation of a little bit of everything, generally from Spain, but also of the Basque Country.",
          "Great art museum with a nice (balanced) selection of art ranging from medieval icons to impressionists. Murillo, El Greco, Goya to Mary Cassatt so quite catholic (with small \u2018c\u2019) though what makes it special is the inclusion of relatively unknown Basque artists whose works are",
          "wonderful museum next to park; In shade of Guggnenheim Museum today u shoudn't miss this gem of Museum in the green.",
          "While the Guggenheim gets the plaudits, you should also take in the Fine Arts Museum. Its collection is world class and makes for a special visit. For the art lover, and art curious.",
          "I highly recommend this museum next to a big garden. Don\u2019t miss their 3rd floor where a 60 mins video show with lighting and sound effect on Hieronymus Bosch\u2019s last judgement day .... really cool. Expect 2-3 hours visit. We spent our last day here after check out our hotel,",
          "There were 110 items on display and the museum guide gave great background information. A great deal of thought went into setting up the exhibition. Well worth a visit if you like your art!",
          "Not heavily visited but has a great collection of painting and sculpture by Basque artists. It has special exhibitions so worth checking if anything special is on.",
          "If you have time and like more traditional art (Flemish), its worth dropping by. Its definitely smaller than the Guggenheim in scale. I personally prefer the Guggenheim given there is more modern art/variety.",
          "This museum is incredible. The works of art are arranged chronologically and the guidebook along with headset provide a great deal of information on the works. On the top floor there was an exhibit that shouldn\u2019t be missed-indescribable but it definitely sticks with you. I found",
          "Smaller and more traditional art gallery than the Guggenheim but lovely and has a nice little cafe near the park as well.",
          "Often shadowed by the nearby world famous Guggenheim Bilbao Museum, it\u2019s well worth a visit. Outstanding Flemish collection.",
          "The building is modern, good light and presents the collection in a good manner. The collection itself is not that impressive though and it is lacking a red thread.",
          "See what the Basque country has to offer. If you like art you won\u2019t be disappointed. Free between 18:00 to 20:00 daily.",
          "This is the \"other\" art museum in Bilbao set on the edge of a park near the Melia Hotel. The exhibition space was very well organised. The 110 years 100 works exhibition, which covers 13th century to the present and continues until mid-September, is well worth a trip",
          "Really good museum, impresive collection for a town of the size of Bilbao. Really well prepared also for kids.",
          "We were unlucky that a lot of the galleries were closed and being re modeled - But that in itself is a reason to beer unhappy, especially as the ticket office didn't say They did have a special exhibit of highlights, so I suppose we got to see the BEST OF But they weren't that",
          "The collection guides the visitor through the history of painting from early modern painting till now. Nice to see the representation of some Basque paintors as well. The museum is located in a beautiful building.",
          "If you are going to Bilbao this museum is well worth a visit. It has some of Spains finest art. I only spent two hours here and it is on my list to revisit next time I go to Bilbao",
          "One of Spains oldest and most Important museums. Different from Guggenheim and well worth a visit. 110 works for the 110 year anniversary showing a good selection of their collection",
          "This museum is often forgotten since most tourist think about Guggenheim, but it's really worth it. It has great classic art.",
          "Great museum. We spend 4 hours there. The 110 years exhibition was interresting, we learned about Spanish and Basque artists. The video exhibition at the topfloor is worth going for.",
          "Don't miss Nemesio Mogrobejo's sculptures. More than life like: they are beyond real. The museum put together the best 106 works of art they presently hold: giving you a chance to get an overview without getting overwhelmed (they hold >10,000 works of art!)",
          "Spent a morning here with my teenage daughter. Interesting mix of art styles, with many by famous artists. Some of the modern exhibits were a matter of personal taste, but did stimulate debate! There is a good caf\u00e9 on-site, and similar cafes in the very pleasant and well",
          "As an insular Brit I had not heard or seen any Basque artists. This gallery put that right! Currently celebrating 110 years with an exhibition that features 800 years of Basque art collecting. For me the late 19,th and early 20th century canvases were the ones most appreciated,",
          "What a wonderful alternative to the famous Designer Architecture Hotel. This museum has great artwork and special sculptures.Friendly personal . A good place to let the art in ! The shop is small but fine.",
          "Bilbao Fine Arts Museum located on Plaza Estacion de metro de Moyua is nice museum with a wide collection of fine arts displays inside. Entry fee to the museum is necessary but the exhibition thereat is amazing. Recommended.",
          "Just around the corner form the Guggenheim, with a much more varied collection. There's currently an amazing exhibition marking their anniversary with works from the 12th century to the present. It was quiet, peaceful and has a good selection of art books in the shop. If the",
          "Better (and more) exhibits than the Guggenheim ranging from the classical to modern laid out over the 3 floors. Definitely not as crowded as the Gugg and with a nice coffee shop.",
          "Do not let the Guggenheim museum overshadow the fine arts one. Here you can ser goyas and other masterpieces. The modern art part is not amazing.",
          "Come here rather than the pretentious Guggenheim. Some real art here that's lasted for hundreds of years and took real skills.",
          "We spent about 1.5 hours there due to time restraints. It is a very nice museum. Works by El Greco, Picasso and Goya were good. We were with a guide so we enjoyed it more.",
          "Enjoyed my visit to this gallery, buying a double ticket with the Guggenheim. There was a good collection of paintings by Basque and Spanish artists, I hadn't encountered before. I was amused that their Rembrandt 'exhibition' consisted of one painting, loaned by Dulwich Picture",
          "While by no means an expert, I really enjoyed a couple of hours wandering this fine museum. It consists of two distinct parts, very old and very modern.",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed my visit. I really wished that I had spent more time here as the exhibits were much more impressive than the Guggenheim. Also lovely building and surrounding park. Definitely recommend!",
          "Lovely museum with a good sized collection. Bright and airy, was not crowded. Would be a good 2 hour visit and located in a nice park to stroll around afterwards.",
          "This museum is in danger of being overshadowed by the Guggenheim but is in my view deeply impressive and should not be missed.",
          "We really enjoyed our morning the the Bilbao Fine Arts Museum which contained many memorable paintings and sculptures, including some El Greco's. The Goya exhibition was on which was excellent.",
          "Spent a very pleasant couple of hours in here to shelter from the rain. Low cost to get in at \u20ac9 and in my opinion they had a far better range of artwork than the Guggenheim next door. Loved the Rembrandt!",
          "We visited the museum in mid afternoon and were pleasantly surprised that the line was relative short which permitted us to stay longer and visit the numerous rooms exhibiting modern art work. The cream de la cram was a Goya exhibit that was being shown. The visit was enjoyable,",
          "This is excellent museum spread across a number of buildings and floors. Sometimes it is not clear how to navigate around, what is clear is the quality of the exhibits and the way they are displayed. The 110 year exhibition is very interesting with a free helpful guidebook",
          "Clearly, not as glamorous as the close by Guggenheim Museum but visits to Bilbao should include this Museum. The permanent collection features a Rembrandt, Paul Gaugin, the Spanish impressionist, Joaquin Sorolla, and countless others from numerous periods up to the present time.",
          "A lovely, tranquil building in the heart of Bilbao. Fine art nicely displayed. One Rembrandt, which I have to say stands out for its exquisite style and technique head and shoulders, in my opinion, above the many works by Goya. A pleasure to visit.",
          "We spent a morning here, the Goya exhibition was interesting with a wide range of his paintings on show. There is something to please everyone here and it is well worth a visit.",
          "Lovely museum with rather interesting collection of permanent exhibits and guest shows. Right now Goya and Rembrandt. If you are member of Guggenheim, you can receive discount on entrance. They used to have free Wednesdays, but I am not sure why it is not happening anymore.",
          "Bilbao is famous for The Guggenheim Museum, but has the Fine Arts Museum as well which has a fine collection of Spanish arts through the ages to the present day. The was an excellent Goya exhibition on with works on loan from across Spain. The museum is well laid out and well",
          "Went there for Goya temporary exhibition but enjoyed the permanent collection even more. The works of local artists from XIX-XX centuries are very interesting and unusual The museum is not big but very well organized and maintained, perfectly located in the city center, just few",
          "incredible pieces, lovely manageable museum, really worth the trip as it is not crowded, the extension is interesting and so is the gift shop",
          "Don\u2019t miss out on this gem. It has an amazingly good collection and it\u2019s central. You get a discount if you are Europeans",
          "We went in with moderate expectations but they were disappointed to be honest. So many of the paintings were alike and not of the greatest standard! We only visited because it was a Monday and the Guggenheim was closed, but it really wasn't worth the effort or the admission price",
          "This museum\u00b4s architechture is by far less spectacular than its almost-neighbour Guggenheim - but the exhibitions inside are much more interesting. This time the Goya-exhibition was on display and furthermore one \"guest painting\" by Rembrandt (The girl in the window). Good value",
          "Although our visit was limited to Goya and his contemporaries, we saw a well curated exhibit and also spent a bit of time among the paintings of classic Spanish art. The galleries are quiet and lend themselves to contemplation.",
          "The Guggenheim is the better building but this has the better art collection, especially if you like Spanish and Basque artists. It had a good exhibition of Arcimboldo when we visited. However, some rooms were closed, including rooms with Goya and Japanese prints. This made",
          "Important to visit for understood better the city of Bilbao old city of Basco Country . Today Bilbao is a cultural reference as medium city in Europe",
          "Interesting provincial museum in that it had many rooms of old representational art but many of rooms of 2oth century art too. I was well pleased that I was able to wander around the rooms of later art by myself as no-one seemed to want to make that transition. It was even more",
          "Much better art than its famous neighbour, but not in quite so spectacular a setting. Paintings from when art was skilful.",
          "Went to see the Goya paintings and there were some very famous paintings on display which were good to see close up, but the majority of the remainder and some other artists on display, with some exceptions like Eduardo Arroyo - Le retour des croisades; were not particularly to",
          "Not the best collection, to be honest, and one of the rooms (and there aren't that many) was closed. Quite dear for what's on display, in my opinion. Couple of lovely El Grecos saved it from a rating of 2.",
          "Situated at the head of the city park, a lovely place to spend an hour or two admiring some excellent exhibitions. The Rembrandt alone is worth the E9 entrance fee.",
          "Visited this to see the Goya exhibition which was definitely interesting to get a bit more insight into his work. There were also many others artists from the same era in the display so provided much context. Had a quick look around a couple of the other rooms storing the",
          "A must go to contrast yourself from the modernity of the Guggenheim museum. Spend at least two to three hours here. There are many fine masterpieces and we particularly liked the ones by Ignacio Zuloaga",
          "We only had time to visit the Goya exhibit. It was good but Goya was my least favorite artist in the exhibit.",
          "I don't know if I got out of the bed the wrong way but me and this museum didn't get on. I'd been pleasantly surprised by the Guggenheim and underwhelmed by this one",
          "A small museum with an impressive art collection that spands over several centuries from Goya to Picasso and contemporary. Loved the focus on basque artist.",
          "A famous Architect of the past century said: \" a museum is an Orphanage of Art Pieces which lost the place they were made for !!! This is a very good Gallery to see.",
          "It was a relief to see some pictures of recognisable things after a couple of hours in the Guggenheim. Lots of Goya and some cheerful naive Basque scenes. Sadly the Japanese prints were not on display when we visited. The cafe, which looks over a park, does good and",
          "I actually found this place better than the Guggenheim for art... some really interesting collections, I especially loved the collection by the Basque artists depicting local scenes. Well worth a visit. It is also free after 6pm.",
          "I enjoyed the art in the Museo de Bellas Artes far more than in the more renowned Guggenheim. The collection is very catholic but with much interesting 19th and 20th century Spanish and Basque art. The Eduardo Arroyo exhibition was excellent. Unfortunately when I visited some of",
          "I love this gallery for its interesting collection, sense of purpose and in my opinion so much better than the trendy Guggenheim. The collection features Spanish and Basque artists and a variety of styles and genre. It is not too big but well worth a visit.",
          "When one speaks about Bilbao one alwys refer to Guggenheim but do not neglect this less known museum. It's a good surprise: nice building, nice location (near a park) with a valuable collection. Good atmosphere, not overloaded. Especially the basque painters from the 19 to 20th",
          "If you do your homework, you might discover an excellent travelling exhibit here, or at the Guggenheim Museum. During our visit the exhibit \"Renoir: Intimacy\" was being presented. It was the first retrospective exhibition in Spain to be devoted to the French Impressionist",
          "The Fine Arts Museum is a little gem in the heart of Bilbao, just what is needed when it is raining outside. Some beautiful pieces, worth spending an afternoon to relax and enjoy what the museum has to offer. The Fine Arts Museum cafe is also worth a visit, with friendly",
          "I could happily spend hours here (and did). Bearing in mind that it has the Guggenheim on its doorstep and has to compete with some serious big hitters like The Prado, this is supper art gallery. I have a thing for medieval painting and the Museo de Belles Artes has some",
          "In and out within half an hour tells its own story, the least said the better, fine art is obviously totally lost on me. Save your entrance fee and buy yourself a coffee/brandy, far more rewarding.",
          "This is a must see museum if you are in Bilbao. I would even recommend this museum much more than the Guggenheim. The collection is really good and shows a wide spectrum of art based on paintings and sculptures. It has a free audio-guide for children.",
          "My experience is disappointment. BFAM is, unlike most museums an galleries, closed on Tuesdays. Stupid of us not check the opening hors before leaving Santander by bus. So, we walked on to Guggenheim for a re-visit. The road from Santander to Bilbao goes through scenery that one",
          "The Bilbao Fine Arts Museum is wonder experience! It is located next to a scenic park and has a lovely diverse collection of art starting with early Roman statues to some of the best of Basque and Spanish art! We started with the cafe at 10:00, and were very pleasantly",
          "We really loved this museum as it takes us from early art right up,to the current day,with fine painting and sculpture to see. The impressionist art was lovely as was the sculpture. The shop and cafe are nice too. An airy new wing houses the modern items. Excellent and worth a",
          "This museum houses a fine collection of art from different periods. As i am from Belgium i was proud to see different pieces of masters from my lovely city Antwerp. I loved the part of the museum with the more recent art. Don't forget to visit this museum, it's close to the",
          "It only takes an hour to stroll through. Lots of local artist, very nice paintings. I enjoyed the local works best.",
          "The Bilbao Fine Art Museum has an extensive collection of Basque art, as well as some wider Spanish and international art, and occasional loan pieces. Much of the modern art was good, but some of the slightly earlier regional art was, err well, less than inspiring. However it",
          "This art museum has fabulous range of Spanish and international artwork, from early pieces right through all periods to the modern day. The galleries are well presented and the museum is not too large as to overwhelm you but saying that don't underestimate the time you need",
          "This place being so close to the Guggenheim could have been overlooked, but it's definitely well-worth a visit for the many nice pieces of art it houses.",
          "The Fine Arts Museum has a fine collection of Spanish and international art. It is located in a lovely park. We were fortunate to see the amazing Alicia Koplowitz collection (now ended).",
          "Bilbao is not Guggenheim only. The Fine Arts museum is also worth a visit. A few minutes walk from the giant in titanium, it is made of an older building joined in the back by a modern one. The collection presents many of the Spanish classics (including Zurbaran, Murillo, El",
          "One of the best art museums I have been to. There is a large variety of all kinds of art that includes the greats such as Picasso and Goya. during my visit there was the Alicia Koplowitz exhibition- an incredible collection of paintings! It is always very nice to see visitors",
          "Recommended small collection, but browsing several art periods and including impressive masterpieces",
          "Weren't expecting to find such a rich and diverse paintings collection in Bilbao. It's definitely worth a visit.",
          "Lovely Museum. Particularly enjoyed the Modern Art gallery with works by Picasso, Giacommetti, Calder etc.",
          "Well laid out collection of select masters. The audio guide is a superb companion! Happy to see one van Gogh, Schiele, Modigliani etc.",
          "I've been to many museums in my life and this is one of the finest regional museums I've ever had the pleasure to attend. It is very proud of its 20th century Spanish art and seeing it was a wonderful overview of this region and genre's art. In addition the have everything from",
          "we were lucky to see the Alicia Koplowitz exhibition at Fine Arts Museum in Bilbao. ahead of great pieces, it was very well organized and made it much more interesting",
          "Great location near Gugg. Well worth at least half a day and then left feeling we would like to come again - ditto Bilbao as a whole. Senior Citizen discount and excellent audio guide. Very impressive one owner travelling collection when we went - widely advertised on local",
          "A nice surprise. Lots of modern art along side the old classics. Also lots of local artists are represented.",
          "This is a wonderful museum--really on the level of any of the great art museums you see in large European cities or beyond. It has a large, world class collection of Spanish art and often has really top notch special exhibitions--check out their website. And--a big plus--it is",
          "The art in the museum was wonderful. We had audio guides which made for an easy journey through all the galleries,",
          "Excellent collection of classic and some compatible modern art. We were surprised by the quality of art in this museum.",
          "Well set out, easy to navigate. Lots of traditional Spanish art. The building itself is rather lovely as well.",
          "The museum is close by the Guggenheim and costs 9 Euros for adults. While fairly small over 2 floors they managed to host a good selection of the world's great artists work - from Picasso, to Warhol and Mondrian, Freud and Bacon. You really need only about an hour to view",
          "We preferred to visit Museo de Belle Artes and not Guggenheim and we were not disappointed by both the temporary and permanent exhibitions. The museum mainly presents Spanish art with its most famous representatives in art history and has a dedicated room for Basque paintings",
          "Beautiful collection of paintings, but wasn't keen on the modern art section. Half price entry with a card from our hotel made it great value",
          "This art museum contains more classic art than the modern Guggenheim . Though not particularly large, it contains a variety of art genres. A new glass addition is attached to the original brick building. We particularly enjoyed the works by Van Gogh , Juan de la Cruz, Goya, and",
          "Spent a few hours here; enjoyed the Alicia Koplowitz temporary exhibition - as well as the permanent art collection. Took a break in the cafe, and enjoyed the outdoor seating area.",
          "There is some great art here and housed in a nice building. We were fortunate with our timing as there is an excellent exhibition there currently - mid October - don 't know how long it is there but worth checking their web site as I would have hated to miss it.",
          "A beautiful building especially built for being a museum. Exhibitions are interesting, but you have to be lucky to catch something very special ( altough tastes are different) We have seen the Aliscia Koplowitz collection which was very interesting showing a full coverage of",
          "It may come as a relief to find that Bilbao has had a proper fine arts museum since 1943. This collection is almost entirely Spanish featuring many of the country's great masters f/e Goya, El Greco & Murillo. There's some surly looking royals by Antonio Moro & Alonso Sanchez",
          "I must confess I don\u2019t know much about art history and I\u2019m sure this place is amazing if you like that sort of thing. There are some nice pieces inside but there are a lot of boring pieces too! The original museum building is very nice.",
          "I wish I could have spent longer here but an hour was all I could keep my 12 year interested. Some lovely paintings. Reasonable entry price. And we stopped for a drink & pintxos afterwards in the cafe.",
          "We enjoyed a couple of hours here when in Bilbao. I enjoyed seeing paintings by the likes of Van Gogh, Picasso, etc. Quite nicely laid out viewing areas.",
          "We realky enjoy visiting this great museum. It may not be world renowned or compare to El Prado but it gives you a great journey through Spanish art, Basque art and right the way through to some of the great modern art movements. Huge variety in this museum. Highlights are a",
          "This museum offers free entry to its permanent collection from 6pm to 8pm every night, so if like us, there was nothing in the temporary exhibits that interests you this is great way to see the art. You still have to pick up a 'free' ticket at the entrance to get in. Some nice",
          "great collection of fine art and well curated - liked the special exhibit, which hopefully will stay permanently as a donation...it was not clear. The non-exhibit area art was too weird for me.",
          "Really good art .It will take half a day to see.My family loved all the old art.lf you go to Bilbao you must see it!",
          "We had a bit of free time and found this museum close to our hotel so wandered in and were sorry we didn't have more than the two hours of idle time before our next engagement. It was only 7 euros entry fee for old people like us and more than worth it. Excellent collection.",
          "Alicia Koplowitz's art works are an amazing eclectic collection which is well worth the price of admission to the museum on its own. Tastefully arranged the collection is presented very well.",
          "There are some wonderful things in this museum. What struck me the most were their earliest works. These included a few really ancient things - a couple of pre-Christan era items including an amazing clay and glass vessel in the shape of a sheep, a tiny carved quartz medalion",
          "First of all. I'm a slow visiter (I like to pass a LOT of time in the places that I like). So for me, 2 hours of free visit (Every day from 6pm to 8pm) was not enough. I liked, as usual, the flamands, the impressionists, ans even some paintings of XV and XVI century. De",
          "If you have an interest in art. We only had a morning in Bilbao and so chose to go here rather than the Guggenheim.A very wide range of painting eras, right up to the modern day.",
          "There are two museums you have to go and see in Bilbao, the guggenheim and this one. The Fine Arts has an amazing modern art collection and i could easily have spent more time there. The temporary Renoir exhibition was fantastic too.",
          "I boo-booed here. I tried to take a photo of a painting. Naughty me. I think you could take a photo of the stuff not in the special exhibition, but my wrists had been firmly slapped by that point, so I didn't try. The art collection was not well known to me before I got",
          "Absolutely loved the Alice Koplowitz collection being shown at the moment - stunning. We saw much overlap to the Guggenheim, but at nearly half the cost. Gorgeous building too.",
          "There just was not enough time to absorb all the fantastic art! The building is light and airy with beautiful natural light. The layout was a little tricky for me... but I was overwhelmed at the extent of the collection. You definitely need a few hours here! Wonderful!",
          "The Guggenheim has the world renowned building and a fine collection of modern, modern art. Bellas Artes (Fine Art) has a great collection of modern art, particularly now with a fabulous 90 piece exhibit of Alicia Koplowitz AND it has an extraordinary collection of 300 years of",
          "I was surprised to see Warhol and Picasso here in addition to the over 10000 pieces of art starting from almost 100 years ago.",
          "A must if you want to see a wonderful range of old masters up to modern impressionists, before visiting, check what they have on show.",
          "The Fine Arts museum, we found, had an amazing collection of paintings. it is within easy walking distance of the Guggenheim.",
          "This is a must-see museum even if you are short on time while in Bilbao. While the Guggenheim may claim fame for its architecture, the Fine Arts Museum easily surpasses it with their remarkable collection of art spanning over 700 years. You could easily spend all day, if not",
          "We walked in the museum for over 5 hours, everything so beautiful and the time to look at it worth while. you have to keep alert to the tape on the floor, not allowed to cross the line. Beautiful work from the best artist history ever had.",
          "For \u20ac9 each this is well worth a visit. The art on display is world class. The environment is peaceful. Excellent museum with a lovely park / seating just outside so you can relax and watch the world go by.",
          "Wery beautiful building both outside and inside. The artwork was well put together and accopagnied with alot of information. Wery good service and food as well.",
          "Impressive modern arts museum that seems to exist somewhat in the shadow of the Guggenheim. That seems a bit unfair. The collection is great (lovely Barcelo's), and the building perhaps more pleasant for a museum (much clearer lay-out and great lighting).",
          "We've visited the Guggenheim before so opted this time for this art museum. It is free from 6 - 8 pm. It is stunning! The Spanish art running from the 11th to 20th centuries is incredibly beautiful. The striking colours and portraits should not be missed. Beautifully hung and",
          "Amazing museum free access between 5 pm to 6pm every day. Good location in center Bilbao. Good exgibition!",
          "For 9\u20ac this place is a great way to spend a few hours in Bilbao. Great local artists from many periods. Building is very impressive no benches to sit and enjoy the art.",
          "Rich museum, all periods, allow at least 4 hours if you like art. Only Alicia Koplowitz collection displays better art from XX cent. than Guggenheim. Stunning flamand, itallian and german early rennaissance...Spanish masters form all periods, incl. Oteiza and Chillida with",
          "I loved religious paintings especially El Greco and Murillion. They need to put more benches in halls...",
          "We had a mere 30 mins but Alicia Koplowitz's collection was well worth the entrance fee. Picasso, Gaugin, Van Gogh, Modigliani, Bourgeois, Warhol and many other iconic artists from the past century or so, with other luscious works from the past 300 years, plus a few other",
          "I was very impressed with all the mix of paintings this museum had to offer. My friend made a comment about not aging enough benches to seat to reflect and appreciate the art. I do recommend this museum",
          "An excellent art collection, and well presented; but don't get caught out as we were by the Museum closing earlier in the evening than the published time, for an unspecified 'special private event'.",
          "This could have been so much better. I found myself walking through with my interest not drawn to much. Apart from the Guggenheim, Bilbao was not of much interest even the old town was not as good as San Sebastian.",
          "The Museum offers a large collection of primarily Spanish (mostly Basque) artists and a very small number of international Masters in the XX/XXI c. section as well as Contemporary Spanish art in other rooms. There is much emphasis on religious (Paleo- and Neo-Christian)",
          "Has everything to offer from gothic sculptures to 20th pop art with classical art works from El Greco and Goya, contemporary works from Gauguin and Bacon and Basque art works from Oteiza and Chillida. The temporary exhibition \"Different trains\" from Steve Reich, Beatriz",
          "The Fine Arts probably offers better exhibitions than the Guggenheim - we saw a stunning and very extensive collection of art whilst there. It's very popular and there are long queues from mid-morning onwards, so I'd recommend going early. Disappointingly the gift shop was",
          "Very goos and interesting exhibitions, this time Van Gogh, Goya and Picasso, from late 1800 to early 2000, very good information and very good prices",
          "Tourists flock to the flashy Guggenheim but neglect the grand Museo Belles Artes, which houses a grand and comprehensive collection of Spanish art that is well worth a visit and is only a short walk from the Guggenheim see masterpieces of Zurbar\u00e1n, El Greco, Velasquez and",
          "We went here after visiting the famous Guggenheim museum the day before. This was just as good in a very different way. Not only are many of the paintings wonderful, they are also displayed in an easy to follow and non-overwhelming way. We fell in love with Bilbao and the may",
          "They have free entries one day a week till midday so good to take advantage of that, I was lucky as I went at the time by coincidence.",
          "Initially we were going to get a combo ticket with the Guggenheim, but the kind clerk there told us that this museum had a free day. You have to visit free stuff! We are not fans of modern art, so went through the new building fairly fast. However, they also have an older",
          "We were lucky enough to view the Alicia Koplowitz collection, that any human being can own this much art from the masters is insane, however it is gracious of her to share it with the world. Beyond her collection, the museum collection stands on its own merits and it is worth a",
          "Very close to the spectacularly modern Guggen; the humble \"Museo de Bellas Artes\" shows a small but highest quality collection from the medieval age to modern times. Seasonal expositions tend to be also top quality. The building is a composition of a XIX century red brick",
          "This is easy to find. If was full of beautiful art and sculpture. Took us about one hour to walk through. No crowds.",
          "Due to the combination ticket (with Guggenheim Museum), we entered to this museum. We saw outside the museum about several artist's exhibitions, which later turned out to be the future exhibitions. Nevertheless, the art exhibitions were nice to see. Very good time to enjoy and",
          "Is this the Guggeheim's little brother or a real competitor? I think the latter. If you are looking for Spanish art - up to and including modern works - this is an excellent choice. Like the \"other\" art museum it has an interesting architectural style but this time a graceful",
          "A great array of different works and its very absorbing. Allow rime to get around and feel yourself relaxing in these wonderful surroundings.",
          "Wide selection of art from all periods. Ancient to Renaissance to Modern. Free on Sunday Afternoons.",
          "I have now been twice to the Guggenheim Bilbao, once two years ago with my son and just a few weeks ago with my husband. Both times I arranged private tours through the museum. Both times we had an excellent tour. Both the permanent and the temporary exhibitions are worth",
          "Just go. So much artistic variety. I loved it. The permanent exhibition is amazing and the tenporary I saw was also very good. Don't miss it",
          "Excellent museum with a lot of wonderful masterpieces. Definitely worth a visit. My suggestion would be to go in the morning, it opens at 10am and there are no crowds at that hour. It feels great to be able to walk around all these art pieces and take your time to view them and",
          "Great displays, knowledgeable, friendly, helpful staff in a nice setting. We're no great art buffs but most things here were informative and enlightening. The history of art through the ages can be seen along with that of artists and locations. Well worth a visit.",
          "We had very little time in Bilbao but having heard about the Renoir Exhibit was checked it out and were not disappointed. It was all we had time to visit, except for the gift shop! Stepping out through the back door we found ourselves in a lovely park with available food and",
          "Interesting collection spanning from XVI century Flemish paintings and religious art to XXth century local artists depicting local life. There's also a section with modern paintings (some Picassos) and sculpture from Basque artists like Oteiza and Chillida. Besides, the museum",
          "Visit this museum along with the Guggenheim. Great into to regional northern Spanish and Basque artists. Sorella was amazing!!",
          "We went on Wednesday morning as free up to 3pm but this will change later this month to another day or different hours I think. Nice with some great art on show.",
          "This Museum came into being in 1945 when the previously established museums of Fine Arts and Modern Art merged. A further, more modern building was added in 1970 and this appears to be where the majority of the Modern Art is displayed. There was a joint entry ticket available",
          "This museum is smack in the middle of town and has predominantly paintings from Spain, since medieval times up unto today. No Goyas or Velasquez, as far as I can recall, but a good collection of lesser painters works. Less crowded than the Guggenheim and a nice place to reflect",
          "Enjoyed the visit very much!!! The paintings are very beatifull and gives you a glimpse of every style-religious paintings,middle ages ,ranaisasnse,barrok ets.Liked very much the Spanish artists!",
          "We spent a nice couple of hours wandering around, first there's lots of old religious paintings, then it slowly gets more modern and abstract. I'm not an art expert but enjoyed my visit.",
          "I preferred this museum to the Guggenheim while I was there, and I went to both. This museum has a lot of Spanish artists - one of the things I wanted to see while I was in Spain. I was not disappointed. There are some El Greco paintings here as well that are well worth",
          "Great museum. Air conditioned and has decent hours. Free entry. There is one Mary Cassatt, 1 Picasso, and 3 El Greco as well as many other regional artists",
          "The layout of this very modern building is splendid. The artists are varied. The paintings are from different eras. Wonderful. Most of the rooms have NO seating but at the ticket desk you can take a little folding chair with you. It's within walking distance from the Guggenheim",
          "Lovely museum showcasing Spanish fine art and temporary exhibitions. It was Renoir when I visited. If going to the nearby Guggenheim but the combined ticket for entry to both",
          "This museum is the typical unique work of Frank Gerry with good exterior art and stucture design. The interior art is minimal.",
          "Supposedly the 3rd largest museum in Spain, it has a huge collection of Spain artists (except Picasso, who only has one small print work in the museum), both back in 12th center and modern ones.",
          "This museum is a short distance from The Guggenhiem. You can buy a ticket that allows you to visit both at a reduced price - however there is free entry to this museum on Wednesday 10am to 3pm and on Sunday from 3pm to 8pm. The museum provides an audio guide and suggest a",
          "One of the best museums I have ever visited. Not too big, but packed with wonderful art dating from the Romanesque and Gothic to the present day, including El Greco, Goya, Murillo, Zorolla, Bacon, Hockney, Picasso, Braque, Gris and many other lesser known but really interesting",
          "The Guggenheim is obviously the museum destination in Bilbao. Not far away, at the edge of the nearby park is the Fine Arts Museum. The paintings and sculptures span from the Middle Ages to contemporary. This museum is definitely worth several hours of your time when in the",
          "A good selection of fine art from Renaissance period onwards. The Spanish painters are well represented of course. Goya and el Greco were my faves.",
          "It is not rated as one of the great art museums but it is well worth spending time looking at its collection. The audio guide was worthwhile and brought to life many of the art works",
          "Nice museum but the collection is a little third rate. They have maybe one of several artists, but probably minor works. Good way to spend a hour and a nice little cafe with traditionally unsmiling service. Instantly forgettable.",
          "For a 1-hour visit. The Renoir exhibition was great and worth the visit. Interesting building, mix of old & new architecture.",
          "Certainly a good collection of Basque and Northern Spain related art is on display with a Picasso, Tapi\u00e8s, Chillida, Bacon, Hockney, Sorilla, El Greco, Renoir etc thrown in. A mish mash of styles and artists. Nothing stood out apart from the Tapi\u00e8s and the Chillida. The",
          "The collection has wonderful Basque artists on show, like Eduardo Chillida. It is situated in a renovated building with a newer part attached to it. While I was there there was also a good show of August Renoir.",
          "It\u00b4s not the most popular museum in Bilbao but could be the best opti\u00f3n for people searching traditional european art",
          "This is one of the finest galleries I have visited (and I have visited major art galleries all over the world). We were fortunate that we caught the final day of a Renoir exhibition and were pleasantly surprised that we did not have to pay an extra charge to see it. The",
          "Just called in to get out of the rain after visiting the Guggenheim. Its free one day a week and so luckily we got in for free. We spent about 3 hours in here and thought the exhibits were of a really great quality in a great space.",
          "Did enjoy the walk through the gallery and at the same time visited the special Renoir paintings. Good focus on Spanish painters.",
          "Stopped here for a few hours on an unplanned visit, and very happily caught the last day of a Renoir exhibition. Take time, take a breath, love and remember what you see.",
          "Don\u2019t miss this gem.Especially works from15th through 17th centuries. Beautiful Zuburans, Murillos, some El Greco. We even saw a lovely exhibition of Renoir.",
          "Amazing art in Guggenheim (better than in NYC, imho. Lovely Renoir in Fine Arts. Make sure to take the silver and green \"street car\" behind Guggy to the Old Town. Lots to see there, too",
          "Overshadowed by the guggenhein this is not a priority. However the artistic range in this museun is completely different and for an art curious I think it is a worthy visit with some famous artists represented in the collection. The entrace fee was about 9 euros.",
          "It's not a big museum, but it does have a nice collection of Spanish medieval art and a large collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art.",
          "Located next to a nice park, the Fine Arts museum is a pleasant museum to stroll about anytime of day. I managed to get a free admission on a Sunday between 3-9pm. The Renoir exhibition was excellent. The permanent exhibition was also worth a quick look.",
          "Not the largest museum which makes it much more accessible to get to what you want to see, The full range from older church art to modern installations and a temporary exhibition of Renoir while we ere there that was fantastic. Well worth a visit",
          "Exhibits here ooze of quality. A pleasant change from the stuff in the Guggenheim. There was a touring Renoir Exhibition on when I visited. The originals of well over 100 of his masterpieces on view. Have seen so many prints of these works over the years....so nice to see the",
          "what a great museum. it is spacious and not too busy. it is also open until 8pm so can be done at the end of the day. at the moment a Renoir exhibition is well worth seeing and included in the ticket price",
          "Very good art museum with a lot of famous artists' art work displayed. There was 5 Euros ticket. You can walk to this place from Plaza Moyua.",
          "A nice afternoon spent viewing a collection of Renoir paintings from around the world. The permanent collection of art would be an interest to those that like religious and icon art of the early church period. Recommended for a nice couple of hours followed by coffee in the",
          "very very good. Easy going and beautiful art. Highlights of European art from all ages and a top floor with beautiful modern art.",
          "Without this temporary exhibition, presenting about 200 paintings of Renoir, the museum would deserved for lower rating. Thanks \"Itimacy\" of Renior, the value of collection is shifting to the prime league. Generaly, the museum is quiet and well organized place, worth visiting.",
          "Another brilliant museum that is totally different to Guggenheim but equally good. Much bigger than initially thought with fantastic displays. Special Renoir exhibition was a highlight",
          "Went on a Wednesday and admission was free. Special exhibit of Renoir was held. Small museum with high quality. Definition an hour or two well spent",
          "Don't miss this as over shadowed by the Guggenheim... fantastic tour through the history of art with many Spanish and Basque artists.. really interesting and well laid out then a great modern section too.... will go back when more time.. superb.",
          "Renoir exhibit was one of the best and most extensive I have seen. His big major works were not included, but an excellent view of his life's works. Well organized and excellent audio. Please note that you need not pay the excessive fee and get the catalog, you can pay the",
          "When visiting Bilbao everyone knows of the Guggenheim but for an art lover, it would be a shame if you did not visit this museum as it has a superb collection and when we visited there was a beautiful special Renoir exhibit. It was such an enjoyable afternoon. Highly recommend",
          "This museum is MUCH better than Guggenheim. I went there all the way from Serbia for Renoir exhibition as he is my favorite painter. I spent 3 hours just looking at Renoirs and then went to the rest of museum which is great! They have both modern/contemporary exhibits and old",
          "Really enjoyed the collection at this gallery. well curated, interesting with many local artists. well worth the time.",
          "We went to Bilbao specifically to see the Guggenhiem, but found out there was a special Renoir exhibit at the Bilbao Fine Arts Museum so we added that to our tour. The museum was beautiful, obviously much more traditional than the Guggenheim, and the Renoir exhibit was much",
          "Lovely museum with a fine exhibition, at present, of Renoir paintings. Well laid out and with good narrative provided.",
          "This museum has the has a good structure and hold contemporary art and fine art I happend to go on a monday when it wasn't busy they have RENOIR exhibit they have a good coffee shop downstairs and library sculptures and modern art very laid back and not overwhelmingly busy if",
          "This had an amazing Renoir exhibition when I visited. I also enjoyed the permanent exhibition. For my taste in art it was a better gallery than the Guggenheim. The gallery is also next to a beautiful park.",
          "An excellent museum with great works of art. I enjoyed the Renoir exhibition a lot. Reallt worth the visit. Bilbao is so much more than the Gugenheim.",
          "You're in Bilbao. You go to The Guggenheim. It's the law. It's fantastic. See review elsewhere. However, if you like your art as well as your bonkers architecture, then take time to go here as well. It has an extensive collection of interesting work from pre-historic carvings",
          "An easy to walk round art museum containing a good mix of Spanish and European art (there was a Renoir exhibition on as well)",
          "A pleasant exhibition with good descriptions of the paintings in the exhibition as well as information about the artist.",
          "I've come to Bilbao primarily to see the Guggenheim (tomorrow) but a friend suggested the Fine Arts Museum. Thinking the 2 might be too much, I parked it. When I checked into my hotel, the receptionist advised it was free between 3-8pm on Sunday. Not one to pass up a bargain,",
          "If it is art you want to see in Bilbao, this is the place to go (vs architecture at the Guggenheim). There is an extensive Renoir exhibition at the time of visit, which was well curated. The permanent collection was also quite solid.",
          "The Gug, of course, is the must-see art gallery of Bilbao, but please don't ignore Las Belles Artes. It has a much more varied collection that spans the centuries (some fine mediaeval crucifixes, for example), and a good selection of contemporary Spanish art too, as well as some",
          "This is a gem of a museum. It has a superb permanent art collection which is very well curated in an excellent building. There was a temporary Auguste Renoir Exhibition there which was worth a visit in itself. I was there on a Wednesday morning so entrance was free.Museum staff",
          "The museum collection is much more diverse that the Gugenheim and they have a great collection of Jacquin Sorrolla. We also enjoyed the special Renoir exhibition. It looks like it might be free on Wednesdays. Otherwise, the price is 9 Euro per person.",
          "We walked into this museum and were very surprised to see such number of wonderful works of art. Truly enjoyed this museum.",
          "this was very good at the time of our visit there was a Renoir exhibition but many other works of art from many different artists well worth the visit.",
          "We visited on a Sunday afternoon and found it was free from 3pm. A Renoir exhibit was on which we really enjoyed. The location and caf\u00e9 are good and the surrounding park is great for an afternoon stroll.",
          "This was a real find. We enjoyed the permanent collection of modern art and the commentary on the audioguide was very helpful. The Renoir exhibition had some unfamiliar works and was well curated and interesting. Good cafe too. The combined ticket with Guggenheim will save money",
          "An excellent museum if you are interested in art. Set in an area of parkland with a cafe nearby. There are some very good paintings by Renoir.",
          "Popped in on a very wet Sunday and, despite not being an art lover, spent a few hours in the museum A good variety of work and feels less pretentious than the Guggenheim",
          "In spite of the Guggenheim being the ex libris of the town, this museum is quite impressive and it has a really interesting collection. We were lucky that they had a temporary exhibition of Monets but the permament collection and the buildind deserve a classification of \u201cmust",
          "When I visited there was a wonderful Renoir exhibition. The own collection exists mainly of Spanish artists. Worthwhile the visit.",
          "What a local museum should be., Good paintings with a lot of variety and some famous names (inc Renoir) This is worth a look if you are in bilbao, close to the Guggenheim",
          "I really enjoyed the Renoir exposition and I found the permanent exposition varied. Great museum shop. Nice book of museum collection.",
          "Fabulous building with a great collection of works. Free admission to museum allowed us a fantastic opportunity to see the Renoir exhibition at close quarters! :-)",
          "Wednesdays from 10am are free entry, and when I went in February there was no queue at all. It's a well-kept museum with a nice, inexpensive cafe inside.",
          "Strange mix of great and slightly odd. Some downstairs sections resemble a local museum, with some stunning early Christian art mixed into an eclectic series of rooms. Upstairs the 20C and contemporary varied even more. Local artists mixed in with great a Gris and Picasso, and",
          "This museum has great pieces, but they are not arranged in chronological (and logical) order, so sometimes it is a bit messy to transit. The old and new building have been constructed harmoniously and I would recommend visiting it. If you are able to go on wednesday, it's free!",
          "Set in a pretty park, this museum packs a powerful punch. The Goya portraits in particular were a revelation. Well curated with a wide range of styles, periods and mediums. The thoughtful hanging (at eye level) and appropriate lighting, greatly enhanced my visit. The cafe and",
          "This museum hides a very well curated collection behind a modern facade. It is a pleasure to walk around the collection in a couple of hours and there is a cafeteria and bookshop on site. Free entry is available on Sundays after 3pm.",
          "I really enjoyed wandering around this museum. The collection includes a lot of religious art. There are two galleries for changing exhibitions but the permanent collection is why most people would visit.",
          "Old but renovated, the Museum of Fine Arts is a classic. The temporary exhibitions are interesting and they have a good collection of Basque art that is worth a visit.",
          "A lovely gallery to walk round. It's a lovely building with an extension linking the fine art gallery with the modern, so providing an excellent collection of art",
          "You never really know what to expect when you visit a museum in a small city. This museum was a delightful surprise. An inconic blend of 14th to 21st century art. Paintings, statuary and a pleasant outdoor space. We were fortunate to see an exhibit of art by Ortiz de Elgea.",
          "It's central and sober, but it's really beautiful and worth the visit. There's not as many people as Guggenheim so it's more pleasant.",
          "We visited this museum and was told that I would need my passport for identification to use my credit card regardless that it needed a secret pin number to be used.I challenged this even though the museum had periods of free entry and who would steal a credit card to use at a",
          "The title is a pun, or antithesis, of my review of the Guggenheim museum. This museum is modest in appearance but houses some of the best Spanish fine art we have seen. The collection is well structured so you can either follow the flow or go straight to your periods of",
          "A lovely building housing art from many eras although mainly older classical paintings and fewer contemporary. Audio description available. Few seats so you need to be up to a long walk.",
          "Well worth a visit - the art works/exhibits were excellent - there were picasso, warhol, gris, goya many famous artists. Loved it.",
          "The museum consists of two buildings, an older 'classic' style museum and a newer 'modern' looking building. It sits in a great setting. The art it contains spans a great many periods and styles, mostly focusing on Spanish artists. Very worthwhile even for those who know little",
          "This museum is not as well known as the Guggenheim and doesn't have the fabulous architecture but it has much better content. An excellent collection of works from all sorts of eras. Well worth going out of your way to visit.",
          "We came to Bilbao to visit the Guggenheim and see the Christmas market/old town here. We found other delights we hadn't heard about and this certainly is one of the best. Only spotted on the tourist map we found the content of this museum more suited to our taste with an",
          "Within walking distance from the Carlton Hotel you reach the Bilbao Fine Arts Museum which is a must in your visit to this beautiful city. A not so pretentious museum on the outside, it hides within its quarters a vast collection of works of art which includes as well as",
          "Somestimes this museum is overlooked in Bilbao because of the Guggenheim Museum. It it totally worth a visit. It is situated in the Park Do\u00f1a Casilda in the heart of Bilbao. Apart from the normal contents of the museum they now have some very interesting intinerary",
          "I loved this museum. It is small and highly curated with a focus on exceptional Spanish artists. I was entranced by the nativity figurines and the special exhibit was incredible. It was a few hours of quiet time, immersed in colour, on a grey day.",
          "The museum covers a wide period from Romaneque to modern times. There are a large number of small rooms. Much of the work is from artists with a Bilbao connection. There are some quite nice pieces, but also some that I would consider not really worthy of being in a museum.",
          "Another \"visit worthwhile\" in Bilbao is certainly the Fine Arts Museum. Not only do they exhibit Basque and Spanish artists, but amongst the many paintings and sculptures of old, modern and contemporary art, you will see paintings from Lucas Cranach, Goya, Mary Cassat, Paul",
          "We had rather a hurried visit because we were meeting a friend afterwards to visit the Guggenheim (we enjoyed this far more). Nevertheless, we discovered some wonderful works of art. I was parrticuarly taken with \u2019Two Girls in a Landscape\u2019 by Antonio Maria Esquivel (1806-1857),",
          "Great collection well worth a visit. Don't forget On Gernika, war and civitas on view at the top floor.",
          "You will have heard of the Guggenheim. You will have visited. You will come away with a mix of feelings the first time, depending on your comfort level with contemporary art. I confess to feeling inadequate and baffled. Then I walked into the Bilbao museum of fine art.",
          "Great mix of old and new. No queue to get into. It's a very modern, easy to navigate three level museum. A must see on your list of things to do in Bilbao. When you finish, take a stroll through the adjoining park, it's very pleasant.",
          "Went to this museum because the queues at the Guggenheim were massive. Much quieter here and enjoyed a few peaceful hours wandering round rather than being jostled at its more well know neighbour. Highly recommended.",
          "Worth a visit. Some interesting modern art. Good collection of old masters by painters I have never heard of.",
          "Found this an unwelcoming place as the staff is remarkably unhelpful and unfriendly. Compared to the sparkling Guggenheim where staff is so well- trained, the guardians of the place are grim and off-hand, issuing the tickets grudgingly and without providing brochures or any aid",
          "The art displayed was easy to see and find as per instruction. Staff were knowledgable and pleasant and ready to help. An excellent shop also on site had everything reproduced one would want. Also the coffee shop was in an excellent area.",
          "Basque art is very well represented and displayed in a beautifully designed space. There was an interesting major exhibition which was just closing. Very full of locals for the special exhibition the rest was almost empty.worth seeing if you are interested in Spanish art.",
          "fine gallery which is well laid out and full of great pictures. we liked this gallery more than the guggenheim. the history of art is explained and shown in easy to understand galleries. helpful staff.",
          "An amazing collection of Medieval art, Spanish Impressionists rarely seen outside Spain, a whole floor dedicated to Guernica 1937. Really worth a visit",
          "The Museum of Fine Art was on our list of places to visit. It's jam packed with interesting exhibits. The gardens are wonderful and add to the whole experience. There was a very interesting piece called \"the mouth\" by Vicente Ameztoy which was shocking but yet also alluring. I",
          "The Bilbao Fine Arts Museum is a first rank art museum a good representation of local Basque artists, much more interesting to us than the global high dollar value work in the Guggenheim. Definitely a treat for those who want to see the truly outstanding work done by Basque",
          "I am a lover of fine art, especially from the Renaissance through Port-Impressionism, and I was knocked out by the quality and depth of art represented by this museum, about which I knew nothing before I came to Bilbao. They have wonderful representation of the great Basque and",
          "Most interesting museum with a broad and rich portfolio of paintings and sculptures spanning over many centuries...plus a set of trial paintings of Picasso pre Guernica...",
          "A large and representative collection of Spanish art with a special focus on Basque artists and their works.",
          "After hearing many recommendations, we visited this outstanding Museum. Great selection of arts that were presented in a logical smooth flow. Layout was very well done.",
          "The best thing about our visit was the special exhibition of super realism, which was fascinating. The permanent collection is interesting but not outstanding unless one is particularly interested in Spanish artists. There is a cafe, but it is very small and does only a very",
          "When we visited there was an exhibition of life like people which was wonderful but I found the rest of the museum rather staid and unattractive. would check first what was being shown.",
          "If I'm honest, we passed through the first 12-15 rooms very quickly: old catholic art in particular is truly inspiring but of less interest to me than later works. That said, the El Greco work is beautiful, and the Durrio's are masterpieces. Worth a look",
          "I really enjoyed the Guggenheim, and this was much more of a traditional museum. I think most people spend 1-2 hours here, where I only spent 45 minutes and was ready to go. Keep in mind however, that I am not a huge art lover, but don't want to miss opportunities to say I",
          "This museum will be good to visit after Guggenheim museum to relax your art nature and remember some basics of art. Very interesting temporary exhibitions.",
          "Fabulous collection. Not to be missed. The collections here are many and each are well worth visiting",
          "The museum can truly be completed in about 90 minutes. It has a great selection of local artists, but for me the best was the special exhibit.",
          "We joined a ridiculously long line of about 45 minutes duration to get in to this museum/gallery on our last day in Bilbao. Turns out it was free entry that day and the whole adult population and their kids were up for a bit of culture! On admission, we quickly realised the",
          "The current exphosition of hyperrealism is very very good. The museum is big and is a must visit in bilbao.",
          "For once am thankful we were rained on as it gave us a chance to head indoor to a museum. The special exhibit on Hyperrealist Sculptures was amazing and worth a visit. We enjoyed the rest of the museum too, from renaissance to modern art. The marble lobbies are works of art",
          "We loved this museum and the impressive art collection that it has. Wednesday is also a free day. The setting is a bit dated, but the diversity of the art is impressive.",
          "Great lay out and easy to fine your way around. Hyper realism exhibition fascinating and thought provoking",
          "A wonderful art gallery, very well laid out. We hit the fascinating hyperrealist show, but the regular galleries are also really well stocked, often with artists that non-Spanish visitors may have been unaware of as well as the usual international figures. Plenty to see without",
          "I went to this specifically because they had an exhibition of Hyperrealist Sculpture, something that I've always wanted to see but never had chance before, and I wasn't disappointed. Not the biggest selection, but a really good cross-section of the genre. The remainder of the",
          "The Bilbao Museo de Bellas Artes is a small but well laid out museum that carries an interesting collection is Spanish Basque Artists besides other well known masters. During August and September a special exhibition of Hyperrealistic Sculptures was taking place which was",
          "The Museo de Las Bellas Artes was not as large as we were expecting and one floor seemed to be closed off when we went. There was a very interesting realist sculpture exhibition included in our ticket which was a highlight. The art from the 21st century was also very interesting",
          "A good varied collection of paintings/ sculputures were on display on 2 floor levels. The price paid was reasonable with a little discount included for the 2 students. We went on week day in the morning, it wasn't too busy so we could a little time taking in everything. The",
          "Spent a morning visiting the special exhibition and the rest of the collection. Loved the emphasis on Spanish/Bask artist, as you can see the rest elsewhere in the world. Not too big. You can buy a combined ticket with the Guggenheim museum.",
          "Bilbao is about the art, so after the Guggenheim, you must also go here. Arrive before 4 p.m. to avoid the crowds cueing up for the special exhibits. The audio guide expounds on some pieces in the permanent collection.",
          "We had selected this museum prior to our trip and actually liked it better than the Guggeneheim. Spent a fair bit of time here happily. Lovely exhibits, gorgeous pieces and a nice spot to sit outside as well to soak in the ambience. Well worth the visit.",
          "Most people travelling to Bilbao would find the Guggenheim hard to miss, partly due to the position but also the sheer spectacle of the container. Possibly not the case with the Musea de Bellas Artes do Bilbao. The building is tucked away at the edge of a park and has a rather",
          "We went to see the hyper-realism exhibition on one of their free admission Wednesdays and have never seen the like. Superb and quite disturbingly realistic. The surprise though, was how well laid out and what excellent quality work was in their permanent display areas. We passed",
          "We enjoyed this hidden gem of a museum. The museum had a great collection and we were able to share our audioguide Do not forget to go here - it is only a couple blocks from the Guggenheim",
          "I wasn't looking forward to another museum after spending so loooong at the goggen h. I was pleasantly surprised the exhibition on show was amazing. I really enjoyed it and would recommend this to everyone going to Bilbao",
          "A small hidden gem in the heart of Bilbao; most people just stuck for hours in the Guggenheim Museum and do not pay the proper attention at the Fine Arts Museum. It hosts some very important artwork mostly \u03bff Spanish artists. Its is rather easy to walk around in the museum and",
          "Such a mix of art, it has something for everyone. Great value for money as there's so much to see. I would highly recommended this museum!",
          "We both felt like Philistines as we had to admit that the words \"fine art\" almost put us off visiting but we were very glad we didn't let our prejudices get the better of us as the collection here is wide ranging with something for most art lovers regardless of preference. Most",
          "The current special exhibition about hyper realism is really great and a must if you are in town but we found the rest of the museum less interesting. Spanish classical painters. Not modern art. Surprising to find one small room with nice japanese art in middle of everything.",
          "A visit to an art museum very much depends on the exhibition at the time. Luckily the Fine Arts Museum in Bilbao had a truly fascinating exhibit of realistic life, featuring a good range of artists in the genre. We wouldn't consider ourselves aficionados at all - we're just",
          "This gem of a museum has over 30 rooms of exhibits from medieval to modern. There is something of interest in every room, with several masterpieces in many. The audio guides are really helpful. Entry is free on Wednesdays, which means it can get quite busy, especially if the",
          "Although i am not keen on fine arts, this was a pleasant visit. On Wednesday the museum is free for visitors and despite the short queue it is easy to finally enter the building. The temporarily exhibitions can be of interest!",
          "An excellent museum that should not be missed when visiting Bilbao. The Hyperrealism exhibit there when I visited was incredible. You can feel you are looking at real people. They also have a good permanent collection.",
          "The temporary exhibition on show at the moment is an absolute must see if you are visiting, it is included within the ticket price and the works are just fantastic. Very good value ticket price, i would chose this over the Guggenheim for value for money every time.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed hour and a half we spent at the Fine Arts museum. The collection, while not massive, is substantial, and is arranged throughout the museum in chronological order starting with bronze castings dating from 600 BC and going right through to modern abstract",
          "For such a small town they pack a huge museum punch! Great collection of modern to ancient art. The hyper realist show was possibly the best exhibition I've ever been to. Take the day to enjoy it, there is a nice cafe and bookshop too.",
          "Excellent exhibition on hyperrealistic human bodies at the moment. Reasonably priced and free on Wednesdays. Recommended.",
          "I was surprised to discover that the Guggenheim doesn't have the monopoly on art in Bilbao. This is a really good museum, too though a lot more traditional in a sense. We visited with young kids and I was a little disappointed that there wasn't any obvious effort to make the",
          "We visited it after visiting the Guggenheim museum. In a nutshell: the ticket costs half the price and the quantity of interesting art available is ten times larger.",
          "The day I was visiting there was very interesting collection of hyperrealistic human bodies, which was incredible.there are also local collection of paintings which is also very interesting.",
          "We did a bodyswerve round the Guggenheim and fetched up at this low slung building, which contains a permanent exhibition of largely Spanish art across the centuries. This was great, but even better was a temporary exhibition of Hyperrealist art, with realistic representations",
          "It was nice. It had some really great basque impressionist art and a history of art with representative selections.",
          "The museum had an interesting variety of paintings from the Middle Ages to contemporary art. It houses a wonderful collection of Spanish painters.",
          "If you like modern art be sure to take in the modern wing which has separate section and entrance. The collection in the modern section has many fine pieces, primarily by highly talented Spanish artists.",
          "Had an enjoyable enough time viewing the quality collection of art, especially enjoyed the works from local artists. The staff, however, left a lot to be desired! We were \"stalked\" by a security guard, we were talked about in Spanish by 2 female staff who came to relieve the",
          "This museum is the perfect example of a dashing art collection which will make you go back to rediscover its gems. The pieces range from those produced by European schools to Spanish masters and relatively unknown local artists. The museum has grown into modernity with a high",
          "We were very surprised to find out that Bilbao has it's own Fine Arts Museum - that has a history much longer than the Guggenheim. They have a treasure trove of paintings from many different centuries and we were blown away by the extent of the art collection.",
          "We enjoyed our visit to Fine Arts Museum, some wonderful paintings both old and new. Some very interesting sculptures. It was free on the Wednesday. We walked through a lovely park to get there.",
          "Just a few blocks from the Guggenheim is this fantastic museum with an excellent audio guide in English and many labels in English as well. The museum store has a wonderful collection of post cards of the works of art on display, something that is lacking at the Guggenheim.",
          "Not far from the Guggenheim in Bilbao is a very good collection of old master paintings including Goya, Velazquez, Zurbaran, El Greco and also more modern and contemporary art in the Bilbao Fine Arts Museum. A fine gallery with cafe and shop in a well maintained building",
          "Housed in a lovely building with a glass extension building. The ground floor rooms house the old masterpieces they are well worth wondering through. The audio system is good, I would recommend picking one up to take round with you, they give a good summary for many of the",
          "This museum has amazing curators and offers a really nice selection of art. Tours are available and entry is free on Wednesdays! It is very easily accessible by metro and borders a lovely park that has WiFi.",
          "If you like modern art and want to discover works from artists you may not have been exposed to before, come here...immediately! I really enjoyed walking through their galleries. This city is so much more than just the Guggenheim.",
          "I loved the art they had on displayed. Everything from gothic to baroque to contemporary. There was a lot to see but totally manageable. Highly recommend",
          "The works here are varied and good covering about 800 years of art with a understandably Spanish base. Inc religious illuminations to upto date abstract and contemporary art in all its modern guises. However, I don't know if it was just because it was very quiet but we where",
          "We visited the Bilbao Fine Arts Museum in the afternoon after having visited the Guggenheim. Being a Fine Arts Museum, you'll find classic arts expositions, but still with a modern art section. It has a lot of art from Basque region artists, but also some renamed ones (Picasso,",
          "All kind of art made before and after Christ. The majority of the art considers paintings. Interesting provided you appreciate art.",
          "Great collection. Very helpful museum shop staff. Acquaint yourself with Spanish artists you probably didn't know about. Go on Wednesday, it's free.",
          "Just a few minutes' walk from the crowded (and wonderful) Guggenheim, the nearly empty Museo de Bellas Artes is well worth a visit. It's really a pity that so many tourists come to see one great art museum and yet neglect another. It's a fine collection of Spanish and European",
          "This museum is much quieter than the Guggenheim and although it will appeal to a more traditional art interest there is also an excellent modern section. I found it interesting to see Basque artists who had worked in the Impressionist style but I appreciated the contemporary",
          "The special exhibition was included,and we bought a ticket that also enabled entry to the Gugenheim.A lovely park is near by. There are many interesting works here,representing a wide variety of international and Spanish artists from varied centuries and displays are well",
          "I am not one for fine art but when I was in Bilbao I went to see what it is was like. Really good selection of arts. If you like portrait art then this the place for you.",
          "This is a gem of a museum. El Greco paintings, an ancient Christian cross that looks moorish to a 19 th century provincial painter whose work reflects the people's lifestyles in Bilbao (masses of people's at festivals)",
          "We saw the building from the river walk, which is pretty spectacular. The building was novel at a time but now there are somewhat similar ones in many places. The building shows a need for cleaning and maintenance.",
          "A well laid out gallery and worth a visit. Went on a very quiet afternoon and greeted by a very disinterested member of staff on reception.( think we interrupted her chat with other staff!) this is not the first comment on staff so perhaps someone ought to address this! Cafe by",
          "It has to be said that I wouldn't have heard of a place called Bilbao if it wasn't for the Guggenheim which I travelled half way round the world to see (and it didn't disappoint). BUT it also meant I got to see this art museum too. What a find, this art gallery is apparently",
          "Enjoyed our visit but not overwhelmed by the paintings on display. The reviews we read encouraged us to visit suggesting that it was more worthwhile than the Guggenheim. Not so. However worth visiting if you have time. One disappointment was the lack of prints available for",
          "The paintings by Luis de Morales are fantastic. I enjoyed all the other art work too. The modern art on the third floor by an artist (I can't remember her name) born in the Basque region is a lot better than what you will see in the Guggenheim.",
          "Well I got a bit bored with the religious works.( By the way Virginilander 10 it was Morales who painted hundreds of maddonna and child.) I personally prefer 20th century art of which there were only a few galleries but it is definitely worth a visit and a must for all art",
          "This museum is nowadays in the shadow of the famous Guggenheim museum. But it is well worth a visit, away from the flashing Guggenheim",
          "Fantastic museum with a Great collection of Spanish and basque as well, But amazing also for modern art and palmyre pi\u00e8ces",
          "The museum is situated on the edge of a pleasant park in the new town area of Bilbao. The building is certainly no Guggenheim, however the space it gives to works of art is impressive. The works are curated in chronological order in a series of rooms over a couple of floors, so",
          "Whilst the art is interesting and the building lovely, the vibe from the staff is so negative. Everything seems like an effort. Didn't see one employee smile. So different from the warm and welcoming atmosphere of the Guggenheim.",

        "wiki": "The Zubizuri (Basque for \"white bridge\"), also called the Campo Volantin Bridge or Puente del Campo Volantin, is a tied arch footbridge across the Nervion River in Bilbao, Spain. Designed by architect Santiago Calatrava, the bridge links the Campo Volantin right bank and Uribitarte left bank of the river.\n\n\n== Description ==\nOpened in 1997, the bridge's unusual design consists of a curved walkway which is supported by steel suspension cables from an overhead arch. The structure of the bridge is painted white and the bridge deck consists of translucent glass bricks. Access ramps and stairways are located on both banks. \nThe Zubizuri offers pedestrians a convenient route from hotels to the nearby Bilbao Guggenheim Museum.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\n\n\n=== Published criticism ===\nSince its opening, it has been subjected to praise as a symbol of the new Bilbao and as a draw for tourism. Architectural professor Alexander Tzonis wrote:\n\"The intelligence, vitality, and originality of the bridge's curved configuration challenged the ordinariness and slow decline of the urban setting, bringing a message of hope and an invitation to imagine better conditions.\"\nHowever, other professionals have been more equivocal, bridge engineer Matthew Wells saying:\n\"Regrettably, the balance of light steel superstructure on the cantilevered abutment ends is strained, like a sculptural toy, and the bridge touches the ground uncomfortably.\"\n\n\n=== History since opening ===\nThe bridge has also been accused of impracticality: it is locally infamous for the glass bricks set into its floor, which can become slippery in the wet climate of the city.The original design connects the bridge on the left bank to the Uribitarte dock and not to the higher street Alameda Mazarredo.\nLocal authorities temporarily installed a further scaffolding footway joining the bridge and Mazarredo street, but removed it under protests from Calatrava.\n\nIn 2006, the local authorities authorized Arata Isozaki to erect a new footway from the bridge to the construction site of the Isozaki Atea towers. Calatrava responded in 2007 by suing Bilbao for the moral rights to the integrity of his creation (a part of the intellectual property under the Spanish copyright law), where a metal bar had been cut.\nThe mayor of Bilbao, I\u00f1aki Azkuna, with the support of his fellow councilors claimed that the rights of the owners (Bilbao) took precedence over the architect's rights. He also noted the slips and falls of bridge users, and the cost of replacing broken glass tiles (6,000 euros a year according to opposition speaker Antonio Basagoiti, 250,000 euros in ten years according to a municipal report).\nJurists and local architects have supported the position of the mayor, holding that the modifications do not affect Calatrava's rights.In November 2007, a judge agreed that there was damage to the creator's moral rights but favored the local council and allowed Isozaki's connection to remain. Calatrava announced his intention to appeal against the decision.\nIn March 2009, a higher court granted 30,000 euros to Calatrava as damages.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nZubizuri on bridge-info.org\nGoogle maps image of the footbridge showing the Guggenheim Bilbao Museum in the upper left corner.

          "Beautiful piece of structure with great views of Bilbao! The best thing is it had a ramp for people on crutches like me.",
          "This is a modern architectural wonder with its smooth lines and shape. Definitely appropriate as the next bridge up river from the Guggenheim. Worth the short walk between the two. The glass bricks are now mostly covered by a sure grip carpeting. This appears to prevent",
          "Light structure, magnifiscent arch. Signed by Santiago Calatrava, by night it's worth a visit!! Lights and reflections can make really nice photos",
          "Very photogenic bridge, very close to the Guggenheim. Walk over it in both directions to get the most of the bridge architecture. Little cafe on one side is nice to visit - also called the Zubi Zuri.",
          "White Bridge or Puente Zubizuri is a bridge located near Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, in the North part of Iberian Peninsula. This bridge was built by Santiago Calatraba and it is very modern and very-known. I recommend when you visit Guggenheim, cross this bridge. Very nice.",
          "Walked over this on our airbnb foodtour with adria. Loved hearing the history of the bridge. Looks pretty from afar but obviously is not as well maintained as other areas in bilbao when you cross over",
          "Beautiful walkway over the Nervi\u00f3n. Needs a little upkeep...the whites are getting a bit dingy and sadly but necessarily the glass surface now has a gray non-slip matting. Lovely at night and elegant design",
          "The outskirts of Bilbo remind more of the countryside, than a city. It is full of parks, big and small filled with trees. This bridhe stands as a modern element in the otherwise countryside of Bilbo.",
          "This bridge is quite an attraction in the city but I must say it is a controversial issue. The bridge was designed by the famous architect Santiago Catralava, but when it was built many defects appeared as many glass plates from the pavement just fell apart and even in winter,",
          "While I'm definitely not a connoisseur of bridges or a civil engineer, this bridge appealed to me not only due to its aesthetics, but also because of the story behind it. Aesthetics: it is very pretty and some great pictures were taken in the day and at night. Enjoyed the",
          "The architecture of this footbridge is striking and well worth a stroll to see it. The curved lines of the suspension bridge are in contrast to most other suspension bridges that I have seen. The fact that it is a footbridge only with no auto traffic means that one can",
          "The white bridge was close to our hotel and the normal means by which we crossed the river. I am probably a little cruel with my heading but there are many similar bridges around the world now. A popular crossover with a busker playing his guitar at the midpoint ands soft",
          "Bridge near the museum. Relaxing walk to other side to head to old town. Nice view of both sides of river from bridge.",
          "Quite stylish architecturally, but it\u2019s just a bridge. Footfall is heavy and the bridge is too narrow for the crowds.",
          "The steps either side of the bridge have handrails each side of the steps but if you run your hands along the rails the upright strutts catch the side of your hands which can be painful if caught unawares.",
          "More than a bridge, Zubi Zuri is an elegant river sculpture. A sculpture to walk on at different times during the day and to admire from different angles.",
          "This bridge looks great from a distance, but when you walk across it, you can see clearly how extraordinary the engineering is. Really worth a detour.",
          "This is an attractive and popular pedestrian bridge that crosses the Nervion River. It is accessible via steps or ramps. The views up and down the river are lovely.",
          "Not sure you would class this in the top things to see.... it\u2019s a bridge, you can walk over it and it\u2019s ok! Not sure what\u2019s good about it though?!?",
          "Designed by Calatrava arquitect soon encountered bilbao council disapproval as pavement was not finished according to Citys weather conditions.... people would fall down in its slipery floor... Arguments between architect and council lead to drastic measures from the council",
          "Unique bridge is easy to reach from other attractions. Nice walk across. Setting is picturesque with steep steps similar to Spanish steps in Rome, nearby.",
          "It's a pretty cool looking bridge with a nice overview of the river and city center at the top. When the wind blows the suspenders jiggle a bit :D",
          "A fun quick visit,with an interesting history. Try to make it part of Your Guggenheim visit. Nice views of surroundings and on the way from the Museum to the cable car up the mountain.",
          "Calatrava fan will love this Bridge; However it's not one of his biggest Projects it is absolut worth to visit it even it is situated nearby Guggenheim Museum nad not far from next tram Station.",
          "We walked on the bridge almost every day so it was very convenient for us, but it is also very modern and beautiful.",
          "it's a pity the glass construction isn't visible anymore. A nice bridge crossing the river ... always fun on a relaxing day in the city.",
          "Bilbao is such a walkable city. Take the path along the river and you\u2019ll notice this white bridge far in the distance. As you approach, you\u2019ll take in its beauty. I\u2019m far from being an expert in architecture or engineering, but I did appreciate the look of the modern bridge",
          "The bridge is very beautiful, with glass pathway. It's also a very nice walk along the river. There were benches along the way, so you can just sit down and enjoy the city. It's also handy for people who get tired easily.",
          "Living nearby, a very handy way to cross the river to walk to the funicular. Would have been nice to be able to cross on the glass floor, but perfectly easy to understand it became too slippery.",
          "The bridge was covered with filthy carpet to stop people slipping it was sodden from rain and rather gross",
          "This bridge was the closest one to our hotel so we used it regularly - very modern and nice illumination in the evening",

          "\"A bridge is a bridge is a bridge\", unless it is one of the multra-modern, high-tech creations that have been springing up around the world since the Millenium. This one is well worth a look if you're in the vicinity. If you're walking along the river-side when you get your",
          "There are many similar bridges worldwide, and anyone who saw any of them could easily recognize the artwork of this famous Spanish architect. This is a pedestrian curved bridge with glass floor (now carpeted due to slippery), which makes a great contrast to the city panorama.",
          "Walk along the river and you will find this excellent architectural bridge by Santiago Calatrava. It is an easy way to cross the river.",
          "Zubi Zuri or the White Bridge at Campo Volantin is nice bridge with some sort of odd design. It is a good experience to cross the bridge particularly during sunset which will definitely be photogenic. Recommended.",
          "Make a point of walking across this bridge when you are in Bilbao. The design is a bit funky and you can stop and take in the views and a welcome breeze in the knowledge it is traffic free.",
          "To see the river and take in the view of the area as you walk along the river. It\u2019s iconic because of the design and also the story behind it.",
          "It's a must to walk along Nervion river when visitng to Bilbao . A sunset walk will be nice for photography as the orange hues of the sunlight shines over buildings and river.",
          "The first thing I noticed about Bilbao as a whole was how green it was compared to other more southerly parts of the country. This is because there is much more rain in this part of the country. That being the case a glass walkway which would doubtless become slippy when wet",
          "So many negative comments but in keeping if looked at as an entry to the Guggenheim. Carpeted now and find that bit of its history interesting & amusing. Does look as though a new coat of paint would be a good idea. Somewhat sensual.",
          "You can get great views of Bilbao from this bridge and I recommend walking across it. The structure is geometric and eye catching and the architecture you can see from the bridge is wonderful.",
          "This is a visually interesting bridge that contrasts with the city around it and makes for great pictures.",
          "This is a modern, elegantly designed curving bridge that links the Abando area with the funicular. Its quite an engineering marvel, worth a photo or two",
          "An incredible curving bridge designed by the master Spanish architect/engineer Santiago Calatrava, with the horizontal curve held up by the suspension wires from the single arc that spans the river, all painted white, hence its name. A perfect foil to Frank Gehry's Guggenheim",
          "For a while we thought this was the Vizcaya Bridge (hanging bridge), after a all, it is supported by cables and when you are on it, you fell it moving. It is a peatonal bridge crossing over the river in Bilbao. Great photos opportunity from the bridge.",
          "I like the look of this tied-arch pedestrian bridge that spans the Nervon River. Its concrete and white-steel modern construction makes it a standout as one of the connectors between the river\u2019s right and left banks. Zubizuri crosses the water very close to the area where we",
          "When you cross this bridge take your time to admire the fascinating arcitecture, with the white arc and its wires carrying the bridge deck!",

          "Walk across this lovely bridge en route to the riverbank and old town. Perfect. It is easy underfoot and affords lovely views of the river and old buildings.",
          "It's a nice bridge that brings you from the Guggenheim to the Casco Viejo. But it's a pity they have to put carpet on the glass. The guide book said it was special at night, but that's not what i thought about it.",
          "Zubi Zuri is attractive by day, when you can see the Guggenheim tower behind it, but is possibly best seen by night. It also serves as a useful link to walk between the Guggenhem and the Old Town.",
          "all Bilbao situated along the river with bridges. Zubi Zuri is very close to Guggenheim museum, so you canot miss it.",
          "Lovely pedestrian bridge. Great link for hotels on Campo Volantin to the main city. Used by walkers, dogs, cyclists and skateboarders",
          "interesting looking bridge and well located to cross the river to get to the Guggenheim and some of the business district buildings",
          "Take this sight in as part of a great walk along the river. It's close to the Guggenheim Museum and to the old part of the city.",
          "A remarkable design for a pedestrian bridge. Worth taking a walk along the river and crossing the bridge between the Old City and the funicular to the view.",
          "It is a pretty bridge over the river - nice to look at while passing or to walk over but it is only a bridge.",
          "This is one of those quirky bowstring bridges, a cross between a bow and a harp. The walkway describes a horizonal curve. This is the same architect who designed Bilbao's Airport Terminal. The ramps and steps on each bank are parallel to the river. The bridge itself is graceful,",
          "As a structural engineer I thought that the designer showed interesting concept. Unfortunately the history of the slippery deck, problems and ultimate solution left a poor reputation of the designers.",
          "We walked across this pedestrian bridge on a slightly wet day, it's a shame they have had to put down a carpet over the glass floor. It is quite open at the sides too. Gets you from A to B!",
          "Right enough, it is impressive and the easiest way to get from the Guggenheim to the funicular, but I don't think, if I was compiling my \"top ten bridges I have ever walked over\", it would make the cut. But it is there, so do it.",
          "The bridge looks pretty but on wet and windy days it's dangerous. In fact the City Council had to put down some non-slip material on the actual main part of the bridge to stop people from slipping and falling on wet and windy days. The architect is Santiago Calatrava and all his",

          "Prominently visible from the Guggenheim, this bridge is both form and function in its being architecturally and artistically impressive. While we happened to cross it going to the funicular, I doubt we would have gone out of our way to view it.",
          "This is a truly beautiful bridge with wide promenades on both sides of the river. We could see this from our hotel.",
          "This was a really easy way to get across the river in a slightly unique way. It's just one of the ways that Bilbao makes itself a very nice place to spend time as a tourist.",
          "This bridge in its original form and creative idea is absolutely fabulous and beautiful. unfortunately due to the slippy surface of glass the city high commission has placed an appalling black rubber bandaid over the entire walking surface ???. This blots out the lights from",

          "Bilbao is blessed with so many bridges, with this one being slightly more interesting than all the others.",
          "A flashy destination for tourists, especially those interested in modern architecture that is at the same time wonderfully functional, linking the two sides of the river by an easily accessible pedestrian only footbridge. The architectural grandeur is quite spectacular and the",
          "A friend told me that it had been Even more spectacular before when the bridge flooring was made of plexiglass with lights lightening up the bridge. Had to cover it with a plastic carpet to avlid accidents when the rain made it slippery.",

          "This is a pedestrian bridge to add to the other bridges in the city. We made a point of walking all the bridges. It is a busy bridge and obviously a work of architecture to visit and photograph. Suggestion for this would be to walk away from the bridge on the west side of it and",
          "Spectacular example of modern architecture close to Guggenheim museum. Clean lines and white color, worth walking on across the river to enjoy the view and shoot a couple of great photos, and after it just land on one of the many benches nearby to enjoy the view with a bit of",

          "Cool footbridge but it's a footbridge. Just happens to be real close to the Guggenheim so good views",
          "One of many bridges in the area and the most ornate close to the Guggenheim Museum. Similar in style to the one over the Thames and not as good as the Tynes Millennium bridge ( I'm biased obviously) but a very pleasing shape and a nice spot to stop on the way to or from the main",
          "It is nice moden bridge, just for pedestrians. There is soft artificial surface on the top, so ideal for runners. And it offers some views on gallery on the bank of the river.",
          "Opened in 1997 this unusually curved footbridge, that is supported by steel cables hanging from an overhead arch, is both visually attractive and functional in that it provides, as most good bridges across rivers do, a right of passage, in this particular case, from the left to",
          "All the bridges along this section of the river are different and really interesting. The white bridge is the standout and one that draws you and encourages you to walk over it. View from the bridge are great too.",
          "It's a strange experience strolling over this bridge, because the surface you're walking on is cushioned and very quiet. It also has very interesting architecture, worth a wander!",
          "It's a bridge. Quite a good-looking one. Very handy for getting from one side of a river to the other, thereby fulfilling the primary purpose of a bridge. I would not go out of my way to visit it but, if in Bilbao and needing to get across the river, it is high on my list of",

          "nice bridge by calatrava, which name means white in basque, but very nice are also the two towers on the bank in which the bridge seems to disappear, this was originally not the case. The architet asked for 3 mio of compensation, he was only awarded 30,000",

          "When we approached this bridge, we thought nothing of it. We walked across it, took photos, came down the other side, and thought that it was quite a simple structure. Then we stood a little distance away, and took time to gaze at the bridge to let it sink in. The more we",

          "This may have been revolutionary when it was built but it is rather mundane today. I am not sure whether it suffers from heavy use or poor construction or poor design but the material is badly cracking in many locations.",

          "Zubizuri is marked on the tourist maps and it is worthy of that, being a spectacular addition to the riverscape. It may not be universally liked by architects but it does reflect the resurrection of the declining industrial setting into an attractive place. With steps and ramps",
          "This suspension bridge by Calatrave provides an elegant crossing point for pedestrians and bicyclists. The deck has some translucent portions, but does not pose too much of a vertiginous experience, even though the suspension seems to be in motion. At night, the bridge is",

          "A beautiful and ingenious foot and bicycle bridge opened in in 1997 and now serving the busy city of Bilbao and competing for attention with the Guggenheim. This is the best way to get from the Guggenheim to the old casco of Bilbao and go and savor the tapas that this area of",

          "The bridge as itself is not that special. Probably the architecture is why people visit the bridge. As far as I know, the floor used to be made of glass, but nowadays it is covered with a carpet. But, if you are visiting Guggenheim, this bridge is quite close so go ahead and",
          "Bilbao is full of interesting architecture and this includes the bridges which are plentiful and provide access to the town on both sides of the river. The bridges allow for walking along well-made paths which pass by many interesting features of the town.",

          "The bridge was close to our hotel the Hotel Conde Duque Bilbao. The bridge is lovely for a walk you get a real feel for the shape of the river. It's a lovely sightseeing walk along the river. Guggenheim Museum to the old town.",
          "Used the bridge to go over to catch the funicular.Read about its history and a shame the glass floor didn't work out.",
          "This bridge is convenient if you wish to walk around the two sides of the river, and visit the nearby museums and parks. Good spot for some pics from the riverside and the landscape around Bilbao. A few cafes are also in the area below the bridge.",
          "It's not worth hunting out for its own sake, but is a good footbridge for crossing the river and exploring the other bank if walking from the old town to the Guggenheim.",
          "We took this bridge most days across the river to downtown...there was a guy playing along to a backing track..either trumpet or clarinet, quite moving at 9h00 am. The bridge is like a sail in the wind...not sure if that is the theme but if felt like that.",
          "One of the coolest walking bridges anywhere - walk over it on the way to the Guggenheim or just along the river. Very stylish, almost artwork itself!",
          "During a walk through the river, going to Gugenheim museum, you can see and cross a good piece of architecture. The floor maybe surprises you",
          "You should really see Bilbao by foot, and don't miss to have a stroll by this architecturally awesome bridge. We passed by both in the day and even better, later at night, and in the evening there are very few people here and you can take really cool selfies :)",
          "Crossed this bridge a few times. It's design is eye-catching and it is visible from the Guggenheim Museum. The footpath over the bridge is carpeted and there is s clear view all the way up and down the river.",
          "Nothing much to say about this bridge except that it is easy to walk on, and very impressive to look at! Also, it is very conveniently located and ties the two sides of the city together.",
          "In Bilbao, you have to cross the river to see some of the sights, and this White Bridge is just a very pretty crossing. No great marvel, but it is an interesting structure,so different than most of the bridges in the city",
          "You don't have to cross the river on this bridge. In fact you will see it best when you walk past it on either side of the river. Bang in the centre and near the Guggenheim is this very beautifully designed foot bridge which is best seen from walking under it.",
          "It gets you from one side of the river to the other in some style. It has a very nice cushioned walkway which is kind to the feet after a day walking round town. However I would not like to pull a heavy suitcase across it. It adds to the pleasant ambience of Bilbao but would not",
          "This attractive bridge can be seen from many vantage points and is becoming something of an icon for Bilbao. Very attractive architecturally and a useful crossing point. A busy spot on the river!",
          "An interesting structure. Similar to the one in Dublin that crosses the liffey. Really dont know why they ask travellers to review the experience of crossing over it. There are so many other interesting things to review in Bilbao.",
          "Modern pedestrian bridge near Guggenheim museum. It connects the center of the town with the great attraction of the Artxanda Funicular. We took pictures over the Nervion river, the new buildings and the wide staircases to the center of town. It has easy ramps for wheel chairs",
          "Lovely bridge unusual design and great point to cross the river. Has a black mat on it so very quiet no foot steps to be heard as you cross it. Stands out in a great way",
          "We crossed this bridge every day during our visit to Bilbao and each time we marveled at its beautiful architecture. One must photograph Zubizuri from different vantage points to truly appreciate the twists of the structure.",
          "This is a modern pedestrian bridge but is not exceptional, there are many similar modern bridges in cities all over the world.",
          "This gorgeous pedestrian bridge is in the shape of a sail and it moves with grace. It is particularly beautiful to walk over or look at at night. It is illuminated and sits over the Bilbao River. All the bridges in Bilbao have something distinctive about them but this is",
          "Modern and accessible with good views of the river. Something a little different that complements the architecture of the Guggenheim.",
          "The design looks simple with neat lines and cables which sets it apart from traditional structures. It is really a good engineering structure that blends so well with the surrounding especially the Ria river. The floor is well laid with artificial nonslip turf and cleanliness is",
          "Walking along the promenade from guggenheim to the white bridge to old town - worth the visit. Great on a sunny day. Plenty of trees to offer shade if hot.",
          "Bilbao is Beautiful!!! The river walk past the Museums, bridges, parks, and shopping is a must do! The Zubi Zuri is just another beautiful reminder of how special this city really is. Don't miss it at night.",
          "This bridge isn't something you need to seek out, because it's in the center of everything and serves an important function of letting you cross from one bank to the other. But I am a Calatrava fan, so snap a picture as you make your way.",
          "A very nice piece of architecture that blends very well in the ''futuristic'' decor on both sides of the river . Great views when you cross it ! Try it ! I have posted a picture of a bridge we saw a week later in Newcastle , England as a comparaison .",
          "Interesting irregular design, with ramps and steps at either end so that anyone can gain access. Once on the bridge itself, the floor is carpeted in nonslip AstroTurf, which is strange to walk on.",
          "Provided you can appreciate the architecture of bridges and buildings the zubizuri is worth a visit.",
          "Walked along the river to and from the Guggenheim museum and crossed on this very modern and impressive bridge. Great views from here along the river.",
          "Interesting design and worth a stroll. Really useful if you want to get to the other side of the river! Check out the two tall buildings astride it on the city side.",
          "You can walk to this bridge that connects two different parts of Bilbao. It's only for walking, no cars go by. It's architectre is pretty cool so you can enjoy getting closer.",
          "Walk down the River from the main centre towards the Guggenheim museum and you will come across this stylish footbridge. In clean polished metal and soft springy floor and big white rails looking like a sail from afar this bridge is a must crossing point. Tram stop Uribitarte on",
          "The bridge is beautiful and the story of the battles between the courts, the architect, and the injured Bilbaons even better. Approach with caution in a rainy day.",
          "We had a lovely sunny day and the walk across the was impressive with views in all directions of the beautiful city and its surrounding hills",
          "Nice bridge , nor really a place to spend lots of time. But it's a nice place to pass /cross on the way to the Gugenheim. Apparently the glass bottomed bridge had lots of people slipping on it after it rained , so they had to carpet the bridge. Furthermore the architect sued",
          "During my stay in Bilbao I had to cross the river every time from and to my hotel. This modern bridge has uplifted Bilbao's image as much as the Guggenheim close by. It is worth walking the bridge and to take some pictures. On a curious note, the bridge had to be covered with a",
          "I love a city built around a river - and Bilbao is a wonderful example - with the White bridge adding a pleasing contribution to the experience.",
          "A wonderful architecture in a unique setting - very stylish and cool designed - there is Even a tartanway on the Bridge to go over it - very convenient",
          "We stayed just across the road from the bridge and great for getting to tram station and over the river to bus station. Used every day. They have a lift on the other side to take you to the higher levels.",
          "I was born in Bilbao ... so many years ago! I certainly can evaluate the huge change of this city. Is not only about the Guggenheim, is a set of well done changes that allow Bilbao to look clean, modern and revitalise. Well done to the government of that city, my birthplace city!",
          "You can't miss this bridge if you're walking to the Guggenheim along the river. It looks great in the daytime and at night (lit up from underneath). Use it to cross over to the Guggenheim side of the river, or head over to the opposite bank for the nearby funicular station.",
          "I saw the bridge as I pulled up to my hotel and didn't initially realise what it was. I crossed it into town twice before I learnt and didn't find it particularly special?",
          "We came to the white pedestrian bridge whilst strolling around Bilbao. This bridge is very new in design and just a short walk from the Guggenheim museum.You can get some lovely photos from this bridge and it is quite a low bridge compared to some that cross the river in Bilbao.",
          "The bridge is a little up-river from the Guggenheim Museum, and there are some nice views back to the museum once you get across. The bridge in isolation is of an interesting design, but I don't think worth a trip in its own right. However if you want to do a little walking tour",
          "The design of this suspension bridge is somewhat interesting. It is for pedestrians and bikes only. It is a lower climb over the river then the bridge that is by the Guggenheim museum.",
          "Worth crossing this bridge to get back into city from fenicular visit. It crosses river near to Guggenheim",
          "Dont know what the fuss is about with this bridge. Dont loose any sleep if you miss it. Only good thing is crossing the river with ease",
          "Its a small bridge across a small river, so not that much to see, but if you are in the area, take a look and cross the bridge",
          "I have visited Bilbao in the past, just so that I could walk across this bridge and experience the Guggenheim Museum. I highly recommend, making this bridge walk part of your daily routine while staying in Bilbao. This way you will get the whole experience, including the two",
          "Unless you are really really into bridges , hey it's just a bridge. I tried to get excited but alas it did not happen. Oh well I'm sure someone loves it",
          "Crossed the carpet bridge to get the Guggenheim. Great design with the curve and loved the idea it had a glass floor...that was a danger hence the carpet!",
          "Yet another piece of beautiful architecture on the river. You pass it on the way to the Gugenhiem , so take a stroll over it as you go along the river bank.",
          "The design of this bridge is really unique. definitely worth a wander along the river to see it. The bridge is stunning.",
          "Gorgeous contemporary bridge that blends into the historical background. It's a beautiful experience to walk across.",
          "It\u00b4s funny how you get excited when something looks spectacular and is fuctional at the same time. This bridge somehow makes you feel good crossing the river maybe because it looks modern and has an antigliding surface!",
          "This is an interesting bridge and I am sure you will have your own opinion. The bridge dates back to 1997 connecting both banks across the river Nervion. We walked across the bridge on our way back along the river from the Old Town to the Guggenheim Museum.",
          "Loved this bridge to look at. Good views both ways down the river. Great design and for foot passengers only.",
          "Beautiful bridge elegancy, simple, modern just a minutes from Casco Viejo. Dont missing this side river, especially on evening time.",
          "Once a trend setter for Bilbao it just goes to show how the city has gone from strength to strength sine my visit over 15 years ago. It still looks ok but tired, my how things can change.",
          "I would not go our of my way just to see this bridge. Seems like it had originally been made of transparent glass and covered by a black \"rug\" to prevent slipping.",
          "What came first....the Guggenheim or the Zubi Zuri?....I don't know, but the Zubi Zuri not only spans the Nervion River but beautifully ties together a larger architectural set piece. It artfully connects opposing riverside promenades, views of the river,a large minimalist stone",
          "Very interesting bridge over the River Bilbao. It is near the Guggenheim museum and is interesting to look at from both sides of the river.",
          "Hi tech design reflecting new age Bilbao.Walking on it will make you marvel how a piece of infrastructure can become art and engage the pedestrian.",
          "A masterpiece by Architect Santiago Calatrava. Well fit in the surrounding urban tissue, connecting the two rives with a fine, light structure without any bulk interruption. Another architectural jewel in Bilbao besides Guggenheim museum!",
          "Crossed this bridge a few times visiting the city. Totally modern. Beautifully designed. Perfectly located to provide great views of the river. Saw a couple have their wedding photo's taken here, quite picturesque.",
          "What a nice pedestrian bridge! Beautiful and functional. Always in use. Safe, regardless the time of day or night. Easy access with stairs or ramps. Location is perfect to get to major attractions and transportation on both sides. Take some photos!",
          "The easy, peaceful stroll along the riverside from the Guggenheim brings one to this pleasant looking bridge.",
          "A nice, walking bridge across the Rio Bilbao, located about half way between the Guggenheim and the old town (if following the river). Easy and with good views. Dropoff on far side of short bridge walk is near the Funicalar, which is very well marked.",
          "Together with the Guggenheim Museum, the Cultural Center and Concert House and the Maritime Museum, the White Bridge is one of the features at the Bilbao River which contribute to the impression that this is now a modern, thriving city. A very photogenic bridge, it is too!",
          "The design of this really beautiful pedestrian bridge is by Santiago Calatrava. Close to Guggenheim museum it provides excellent place to take pictures. The bridge uses white concrete and steel, hence the name. Over the Nervion river, it connects Campo Volant\u00edn Boulevard with",
          "I must admit that I simply cannot be objective in this review. Do cross the bridge (careful if it has rained!) the views to the Guggenheim museum are great and you can take good photos, but if you are short of time and only in a blitz viit to Bilbao you can skip the visit.",
          "It is worth walking across it to see the view from the bridge. It is a pedestrian bridge and many people travel on it every day.",
          "Fun to walk across this pedestrian bridge. Good views of the Guggengeim from the bridge. Then a nice walk along the river on the other side.",
          "I really enjoyed walking across Zubi Zuri designed by world famous architect Santiago Calatrava. The bridge spanned across the river connecting the city and providing a nice visual as well as access for bicyclists and pedestrians.",
          "It's really just another foot bridge - it does provide nice views of the river and building landscape. We came across the bridge while taking a walk along the riverbank prominade (on our way to the Guggenheim museum).",
          "A very neat curved and suspended design this path across the river is a popular is a mix of practicality and design taken to excess. With steps and ramps on either end this is fully accessible and the 'carpet' style walkway makes it safe in both wet and dry conditions. And if",
          "Being from Newcastle, we had to see what is very like our own millennium bridge. Nice views along the river, and easy to access the funicular from here too",
          "Zubi Zuri bridge is nice foot over Bridger over the river near mesume...you will love the view from the bridge...and I liked its structure also...overall you can hav s nice walk over the bridge...",
          "Walk across the bridge or sit by and watch the people and river. A great bridge! Bridge is close by to other attractions so plan with your Guggenheim day.. All in walking distance",
          "Our guide arranged a trip across the river in our tour bus and it was really neat. An unusual suspension bridge with great views on a short trip across the river. Nice walking areas promenades on both sides. You can go across on foot or in a vehicle.",
          "The bridge is nice but it looks very similar to a few of other Caltrava's buildings. The bridge had design problems so the city of Bilbao had to fix it. Calatrava didn't like what the city did with the bridge (fixing it without him) so he is suing the city now.",
          "Another great example of the amazing architecture in Bilbao. A great place to view everything along the river.",
          "A significant and serious bit of practical architecture. Enjoy the perspective from a distance and then see how everything changes as you cross it, especially when approaching from the east.",
          "This bridge was only a block or so away from my hotel and may getting to the Guggenheim a breeze. Great place to people watch kayaking or walking along the river.",
          "A beautiful piece of architecture designed by Santiago Calatrava, the White Bridge offers a wonderful pedestrian crossing of the Nervion River in Bilbao. From afar it also adds to the views of the city. From underneath the curves and structure are also iconic of Calatrava's work.",
          "Very useful landmark for locating our hotel. Great platform for watching the Aste Nagusia fireworks in August although it gets crowded. The river that runs around three sides of Bilbao offers tranqil and pleasant views.",
          "If you stay on the opposite side of bilbao riverbank it will be a pleasure to cross everyday the Calatrava bridge",
          "Yes it's a bridge. Yes it is white (although it could do with a clean). Sometime you may walk across it because it is very central. So why not be a good tourist and take a photo or three.",
          "Very unusual structure. Definitely take a walk across the bridge and take pictures from different angles.",
          "Eye-catching and stylish Calatrava bridge, every tourist will cross it anyway. Good photo opportunities.",
          "As the bridge is situated very well, most visitors will cross the river this way. It is a walking bridge, no other transport allowed. The view over the river to both the old centre and the Guggenheim direction is very nice, and worth a picture ( as is the bridge itself).",
          "A lovley bridge forming part of our frequent walks along the river in Bilbao just enjoying the city. Lots of bridges to choose from and always the Guggenheim to pique your interest, looking different at ever hour of every day as the light changes.",
          "An interesting piece of Bridge architecture close to the Guggenheim. Not worth a visit on its own but it does add to this vibrant city.",
          "I loved looking at the Zubi Zuri from far and close up. I was lucky enough to stay at a hotel just feet from it and crossed it to take the tram and to walk to \"El Gugen\". I loved Bilbao. . . how modern and all the old parts. ZubiZuri is the funkiest bridge ever. Kids love",
          "It is a bridge. It is white. We walked across it to get to the other side. The river walk is lovely - on both sides.",
          "Calatrava built Zubi Zuri, and the best view of it is up close because of the pitch the cables. I walked across this bridge for a month to get to the metro, and It is a good place to look up and down the river. If you are interested in architecture or design, the bridge is a",
          "Our hotel was right beside this bridge which is very impressive as bridges go. We walked across it several times a day. Great spot for taking pictures and there's a great view of the Guggenheim.",
          "We were fortunate to have an apartment just 200 meters away from this bridge. We walked across it several times a day. Beautiful for pictures and a great view of the Guggenheim Museum.",
          "its white..... and its a bridge..... pretty much sums this one up. what else can i say? oh, its over some water.",
          "Nice bridge, looks way better from outside that from when walking on it. It seemed a bit run down - somewhat dirty and dusty.",
          "A great link into the commercial centre and access to walk along the river. Great for photos and access to the Guggenheim museum.",
          "The bridge is designed by the world famous architect Satiago Calatrava, but is not one of his better and most beautiful bridges - though wearing it all his typical characteristics: the harp-shaped structure, the dazzling white color and the slender dimensions ...",
          "This was excellent, I was walking across this with my wife and kids and the police were covering up a cadaver- in broad daylight! I was too spooked to take a selfie, though.",
          "This was a very nice bridge right across from the Gugg. We happened to cross it twice, and the second time offered more photo opportunities as there was no one on it :)",
          "It is nice to see a modern bridge in the middle of the historic city, it is a pedestrian bridge with a nice twist.",
          "\"Crazy\" Calatrava. :-) He made a bridge of glass and steal, then people started falling down during rainy days so the original idea of floating above the river had to be changed - they covered it with some anti slippery material and now it's only a curved bridge.",
          "Typical Calatrava architecture, matches real nice with the modern surrounding buildings. Unfortunately ugly black kind of carpet has been put on the glass floor of the bridge",
          "I enjoyed walking and admiring the bridge. It's beautiful. It was specifically designed for the city of Bilbao.",
          "A beautiful modern bridge, the Zubi zuri is a lovely thing to see. Be careful when crossing if wet as it can get quite slippery and I have seen many people taking a tumble while crossing it.",
          "This is a beautiful pedestrian bridge, but it resembles Calatrava's other bridges so strongly that I instantly knew it was one of his. Similar design elements to Sundial Bridge in Redding (California), even including the glass blocks in the deck. Having said that, it's a",
          "Calatrava at his best! Even though his design is now predictable, there is still a certain freshness each time I see another of his masterpiece bridges. They are just so huggable and approachable. Of course, it helps that they are all pedestrian bridges, so you can almost become",
          "This is a typical Calatrava shape. It provides a pedestrian crossing at a convenient point , especially for those who want to use the Artxanda funicular on the north bank of the river. If you have time, try to visit at night, as the illumination is very appealing.",
          "Wandering along the river promenade towards the Guggenheim Museum from the Casco Viejo we got our first glimpse of Zubi Zuri (White Bridge). Design in 1997 as a pedestrian bridge, it crosses the River Nervion. It is very elegant, white, access to the bridge is via a set of",
          "Such a beautiful city for a stroll around ... There is lots to see and do but a meander along the river bank on a Sunday morning is quite tranquil . The Zubi Zuri spans the river and is quite majestic in its form. Music can be heard from the odd busker on the bridge and it",
          "We walked from the bus station instead of taking the tram to the Guggenheim.You pick up the new, San Mames football stadium the congress and music venue and a lovely waterfront walk.Before or after the Guggenheim cross here to see the best of the museums architecture.",
          "Beautifully designed and constructed pedestrian bridge across the Nervion River. Close to the Guggenheim museum and once you cross it and walk along the other shore you get a very good view of the complete Guggenheim.",
          "The bridge is quite beautiful and you will see it when walking anywhere near the Guggenheim. Take the time to walk across it as the views are quite amazing especially at night. Take your camera!",
          "Hardly worth a detour. But, when I passed by on my way to the Guggenheim, I was captivated. I cannot, for the life of me, figure how the forces are captured and directed in such a way as to allow the structure to stand. Clearly they have bee, but it baffled at least this mortal.",
          "For a small city, Bilbao does public spaces right. This bridge is unique and a great asset to the riverfront. A walk across is a must for an afternoon walk.",
          "We stayed at Hotel Miro and used this bridge to cross the river to head to the old town. Quite a nice modern bridge and okay for wheelchair access too.",
          "A masterful piece of design, well worth trekking over both day and night! Not only a beautiful thing but a well used transport route by the locals. Make a point in crossing at night.",
          "Stunning sight when you first see it, of course a bridge is functional so not always appreciated. Until recently it had a full glass floor which must have been amazing in the sun , sadly not functional in winter. So now it has a 'carpet'!!! You will find yourself crossing it",
          "This pedestrian bridge has an unusual design. I rate it Very Good not only for its architecture but because it is a pleasant way to cross the river (we stayed on the north side) and it offers good views of the Guggenheim Museum. There have been issues with the glass panels of",
          "We had visited the old cit and wanted to go to the Guggenheim Museum. We had to use the bridge to cross the river. It is a nicely designed little bridge.",
          "The ZubiZuri is an impressive arch bridge over the Nervi\u00f3n River, accessible only to pedestrians and cyclistst. The bridge was opened in 1997 and is also called the white bridge. The bridge is located near the twin towers \"Torre Isozaki Atea\". From the bridge it is a very short",
          "It's a bridge across the River Nervion, it's painted white and it bounces a bit; what else is there to know? Take care in the rain as the glass panels are quite slippery.",
          "What can I say except it's another boring bridge in Bilbao! Nothing special and not worth making the effort to see it",
          "What should I say - it's just a modern bridge. There are not enough words to fill the 100 required characters :-)",
          "There is not much to say really apart from it looks good and we walked over it on our way to the funicular . A stunning design .",
          "Zubi Zuri is a great landmark for at least two purposes. Go over the bridge and you'll find a good contemporary restaurant named by the bridge. If you turn left from the brigde and right from the next corner you'll arrive to the Plaza Funicular which is the starting point of the",
          "I hadn't realised this was considered as an attraction until i seen it feaured in TA's list. On reflection I guess it has architectural merits and i can appreciate that some thought had gone in to its modern design but I wouldn't have necessarily used it were it not directly",
          "Nice architectural piece and especially because it is meant for pedestrians only. Offers good views of the river and surrounding areas.",
          "This is a beautiful modern pedestrian bridge that is part of the relaxing and interesting walk between the Guggenheim museum and the old town. There are great views in either direction. It is worth lingering to take then in.",
          "Take your time on your approach, it looks fabulous from any angle but once you set foot on the bridge the off-centre design and simplicity of it will hopefully make you stop and look. It is beautiful, so look up, down, take it all in!",
          "When in Bilbao, one should certainly take a walk on this bridge, not only for the nice views but also because it feels almost like walking on \"cushions\" :-)",
          "This unique pedestrian bridge with its unusual design is aesthetically pleasing to the eye as it is white,sleek and stylish!!! Its walkway curves,like the meandering Nervion river,linking the right bank and left bank of the river.The floor of this tied-arch footbridge is unusual",
          "Love this bridge, I don't like heights and this didn't bother me. Very modern and fun to walk over to the other side of the river.",
          "Great aesthetics but I don't think Calatrava, this world-wide famous architect, will be doing anything more in Bilbao, ever! Both his bridge and his airport were a fiasco in therms of usability...",
          "A beautiful work by the famous architect Santiago Calatrava. Great fews of the city from here. Within walking distance of the Guggenheim museum",
          "We walked over this bridge several times during our stay in Bilbao. Weither it be walking to the guggenheim museum or just to do some shopping we always found ourselves crossing here. The modern design is provoking to the senses while its cool design fits perfectly in this artsy",
          "Sounds daft to say that, but it is there in your face tempting you after you have walked past the Guggenheim museum. Striking archetecture",
          "Its worthwhile to pay a visit to this bridge, it is very nice. Access ramps and stairways are located on both banks and it offers pedestrians a convenient route from hotels to the nearby Bilbao Guggenheim Museum. The bridge is designed by architect Santiago Calatrava opened",
          "just love the way the bridge curved and dropped away loved the design and my daily route to work! it delivered you to the centre of town where you could go in any direction",
          "The bridge looks lovely and is in keeping with the modernist feel to Bilbao's architecture. I gather that the surface was initially of glass but so many people slipped and fell in wet weather that they carpeted over the glass at a cost almost equal to the original commission!",
          "We parked high up in a residential area of Bilbao and walked down. Whilst walking along the river we crossed this bridge which I thought was very pleasant. We have a few similar to this in the UK. A nice quirky piece of architecture in a great location.",

          "I enjoyed the sweeping curves that reflect the course of the river, the curve of the surrounding hillsides and the class of the Guggenheim. I can also understand why the architect was so miffed about a later addition of a link bridge over to the adjacen office blocks.",

It is on the right bank of the Nervion River, next to Casco Viejo. Its built area of 10,000 square metres (110,000 sq ft) makes it the biggest covered market in Europe. Inside it, there are stalls that sell different products, mostly fresh produce. There are fish markets, butchers and green grocers. There is also a part of the market for the local farmers' products. \n\n\n== Location ==\nThe Ribera Market is on Ribera St., on the bank of the Nervion River. On the site of the old grand square. Next to it is the Church of San Ant\u00f3n. The Ribera St. is between the banks of the river and the buildings of the Old Town, also known as the \"Siete Calles\" in Spanish or \"Zazpi kaleak\" in Basque that is the main commercial area of the city. The narrow gauge Euskotren train station is 3 minutes from the market.\n\n\n== More information ==\nIt was recognized in 1990 as the most complete municipal food market by the Guinness Book of Records. It is the largest in terms of traders and stalls and the biggest covered market as regards space in the whole of Europe, with a surface area of 10,000 square metres. Refurbishment work began mid-2009 aimed at renewing its structure, stalls and services to remain a reference for shoppers in the 21st century. More than 60 merchants provide customers with produce: meat, fruit, shellfish, cheeses, cooked meats, frozen food, mushrooms and fungi.\n\n\n== External links ==\nMercado de La Ribera",

          "And old market revisited for eating and buying food. I found it too busy, noisy and confusing but it can be fun to eat there. I always like going around though.",
          "We had low expectations because we thought this was a meat/fish/veg market perhaps with the odd cafe. We were delighted to find a stylish and elegant food court with around 8 separate counters offering the most appealing pintxos and pastries. They had coffees and alcohol on",
          "Although there are some mixed reviews, the market is well worth a visit if in Bilbao. There\u2019s a great selection of fresh food (we bought fruit and nuts before heading out for a day trip) and the food hall is a perfect stop for breakfast with several places offering different",

          "Fantastic food market much on the lines of the English Market in Cork. All sorts of fish, meat - even pigs ears, cheeses spices and lots more. There was also a large restaurant with numerous stalls. It was very handy to walk to from the old town or a tram stopped at the front",
          "Lovely local market with great choice for meat, veg and fish lovers. Tried a few pintxos, cod was not to my taste, but pork skewer v nice. Perfect place to watch peeps go by and handy with kids to mull about.",
          "Regrettably I have to report my 1st robbery from a client in 24 years travel here in the whole of Northern Spain from the Pyrenees to the Atlantic Coast. BEWARE take extra care entering/exiting the market where you may be distracted by the huge stained glass window or the",
          "Great place to start the day - breakfast pinchos and coffee by the river. Friendly service, great atmosphere.",
          "After the Guggenheim, we came down here to check out the old town area. The market is nice if you want a one stop shop for food variety. But there are so many great bars serving food every where around you, it seems a pity to spend your time in one place. Food was good.",
          "By view I mean the view on food and ingredients. It's a market with a food hall (self-service). Really nice for a quick bite.",

          "Get there before 8.00. Get a table and enjoy the amazing choice of street food and drink on offer. Take a fork as not all pl ces provide cutlery or paper napkins.",
          "So so so disappointed - a handful of places to eat in a dark environment - the offering was quite repetitive. All felt very grubby :(",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed the craziness of a Saturday lunchtime with a drink and pintxos. You have to be on the ball to get a seat at a table, and then it's just a matter of working out what to choose. We managed 4 pintxos, a beer & a glass of white wine for under \u20ac13, but could have",

          "We went to the market for lunch, rather than to view the market goods. We had pintxos from several different restaurants there. They were all great. They were also huge. If you compare pintxos with pintxos or tapas from other parts of Spain's markets this one wins in my",
          "I enjoy \u201cThe Market\u201d! Take pictures of beautiful pintxos. Txerri Duck had the best kabobs. It seemed to take longer to get, but when my kabob came, it was wonderful and more extras than I expected. Salad, bread and fries. Very nice.",

          "I\u2019ve been to many markets in Europe, and this was one of the least compelling. Located indoors, it has a more sterile feel to the others I\u2019ve visited. When I arrived, it wasn\u2019t particularly crowded and, unless you\u2019re there to buy something specific, there\u2019s not much to see.",
          "What a fabulous market right on the banks of the river. It's on two floors. The ground floor has the most amazing stands offering tapas of so many different varieties. Plus some awesome desserts and sweet foods. In addition they offer great beers wines from Spain. The floor",
          "La Ribera is impressive due to its size and elegant renovation. I happen to love the old markets of Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia, but La Ribera is clean, elegant and swanky. The food hall downstairs is great but not quite the level of the Lisbon Time Out Market.",
          "NB: the market is open only until 2:30 M-Th during the summer. (Friday it stays open later.) The stained glass windows looked fascinating. We missed so much, but the food court is excellent and we spent a long time here eating, drinking both beers and coffees and just relaxing",
          "Went here for an evening event where we could try almost all of the food/drink shops in the market. The food there was excellent, whatever I tried was really good and they also had good Spanish wine for drinking. It is definitely a great place to visit if You want to try out",
          "In search for breakfast, we found this gorgeous market along the river. It's been around for a long time but inside it is modern and clean. Several shops offer Tapas in the morning, and they were most delicious! My favorite, and first time experience, was the deep-fried slice of",

          "A must visit for food lovers, open most the day daily, fresh, reasonably priced with plenty of choice for most. Unfortunately Pintxos are not made with vegetarian or vegans in mind and we found this across the Basque Country- the vegetarian options which even when you ask and",

          "If you had not had the experience of eating in a market in Spain, the Ribera Market is well worth the visit. If you are familiar with this custom and have been to La Boqueria in Barcelona or the Mercado de San Miguel in Madrid, the Ribera will pale in comparison but still I",
          "Great place to wander around. The food hall is sensational and a must. The food is great and looks stunning.",

          "Visited the market during my stay in Bilbao. Since the weather was a little cold for my taste, found the market which was perfect. Smaller than the San Miguel in Spain, but well stocked and ample tables to seat. My only critic is that there is not enough personnel to clean the",
          "I'd heard how wonderful this market it. It IS very good and large, but not as big as I'd expect. Traditional patisseries and charcuteries, seafood and produce stands and many bars for pinxtos, beer and cafe. But we were in and out in less than an hour. Compared with markets in",
          "I usually go to the local markets to find a fishmonger or oyster bar but could not find the latter. There was a shop in the food court that had wines and oysters but the guy wasn't very welcoming so didn't bother. Good selection of meats, fish, crustaceans as well as jamon,",
          "The market is definitely worth a visit to not only browse the huge selection of fresh food stalls but also try some local, authentic pintxos. Although we felt the actual market lacked the atmosphere of some of the other markets we\u2019ve seen in Europe (eg Florence, Porto, Venice,",
          "This food court on the upper level of the market is open even on Sunday when the market is closed. This is a good option for solo travelers who don't want to wait until 8 pm for restaurants to open. Plus, there are a lot of choices, so you can sample the Basque cuisine with a",
          "We were impressed with the dining opportunities at the market. Lots of different stalls selling a range of drinks and food snacks for a couple of euros each. Plenty of spaces to sit both in and outside. Nice for a quick lunch to sample some Basque cuisine. Only downside is that",
          "We loved it! The choice of food is absolutely delicious and so very versatile! There is an enclosed section on the ground floor where you can eat. On weekdays the Foodcourt isn't anywhere as busy as Madrid's one, which is a bonus. You can easily find a spot and enjoy! Pintxos",
          "If you have been to and enjoyed the Mercado San Miguel, you will enjoy this place. You collect tapas/pintxos / drinks from a number of vendors and share common eating areas. The food is very good and means you don\u2019t have to bar hop. The building is a beautifully renovated Art",
          "The is a very large market with fresh meats, fruits, veggies and loads of fish. There is an area to eat as well for tapas or a glass of wine etc. worth going to. Highlight of our tour",

          "Old market halls have become such gourmet venues that most customers were lunching upstairs in the busy food court and sunny terrace. The variety of pintxos, small bites gathered on a piece of bread was the best I have seen in Spain. The building with fine stained glass windows",
          "Half of the market is vendors selling fresh meat and produce. The other half is the Spanish equivalent of a food court, with vendors selling pintxos (small plates), paella, baked goods, etc., and tables for seating. Next door is San Anton church - well worth a visit.",

          "A great place to visit. Lots of different kinds of produce - fish, meats and all different types of eggs and cheeses. At the top there are lots of places to eat the lovely pinxtos and grab a drink. Where else could you see 2 chaps drinking beer at 10 a.m.? There was also an",

          "Timing is everything and would check when the markets are in full swing - There are pintxos and bars within but then again they are everywhere on the streets too - so really no need to go inside for them. Compared to Madrid & Barcelona markets these were unimpressive",
          "Impossible to enjoy eating a nice meal and enjoying the view because the place is crowded and very noisy inside! Plenty of choices but very difficult to find a place to sit down",
          "Not only a vibrant marketplace but also a fun and buzzy place to stop for a glass of wine and a snack.",
          "The market is split between the raw ingredient retailers. ( upstairs and half of the downstairs) and the pintxos sellers in half of the lower floor. Take a walk looking at the amazing meat, fish, fungi, cheese, fruit and vegetables on offer and then squeeze into the pintxos",
          "... but there are better in Europe and for that in Spain. The produce is still first class but the actually site as tourist attraction lacks a vibe. Markets of Barcelona, Madrid Valencia are better experience",
          "Enjoyed the hustle and bustle of the fish market , meats and vegetables however the main attraction being the numerous pinxtos ( tapas) on offer you can enjoy with a small beer or sangria. Snacks can be very more-ish and the bill can tot up considerably but you do get a chance",
          "A busy, noisy fun hub of pintxo bars in the old Ribero Market. So much to chose from. Tram stops right at the entrance.",
          "We actually managed to miss it in full swing with half-day closings but the food court on the first floor is fab. Varied, reasonably priced and a few stalls doing a fixed price special menu.",
          "Stumbled across this place whilst walking in the drizzling rain of Bilbao. Nice range of market stalls offering a variety of fresh produce. Some amazing butchers with what seem like half sides of cows for sale! Nice food hall downstairs which has several places to choose from.",
          "Ended our tour of Bilbao at the market for some food and we were let down. It is a great idea to have various pintxos bars and a central area to eat but you can get much better food and better price around Bilbao bars. They need to do something different to make it better than",
          "The market had a fascinating range of foods, mainly fish and meat, The eating area downstairs had a range of outlets for every taste. You may find cheaper food elsewhere but you are spoilt for choice.",
          "We came upon it by accident whilst walking around the old town. A nice piece of architecture. It\u2019s a large, cavernous space. The 2 storeys we walked around had some interesting types of local food. It wasn\u2019t really busy when we were there, late morning on a Wednesday, but well",
          "We went twice to have pintxo for lunch. We chose different things from different places. The olive stall was amazing and it's all so cheap.",
          "This is a typical updated market with meats, seafood, veggies, breads, and lots of pintxos stalls available for snacking. Recommend that you go there when you are a little hungry for some pintxos. There are multiple levels so take your time.",
          "We visited with four kids from 14-7 and it was open even when the rest of the market was closed. Lots of pintxos for Newton\u2019s to try. We all left full which was a triumph for a family with some very fussy eaters. The staff at the bar were very friendly and gave the kids sweets",
          "A beautiful old market building with lots of fresh fish and meat to look at. There's also a part where you can eat many different goodies.",
          "The fresh food on sale in the market looks excellent and you can pick up some of the local delicacies to take home. The food hall upstairs has a great variety of pintxos and other Spanish foods as well as wine, beers and cocktails. Don\u2019t make the mistake we made and go to the",
          "Most Spanish cities offer a great food market and Bilbao is no different. The market is situated right beside the river and you can eat outside in good weather. The actual area for eating and drinking is not that big so go early in the day or midweek if you want a quieter",
          "I love to see all the fresh produce for sale - like an art gallery of food. Lovely terrace overlooking the river to kick back and relax with some pinxtos and a glass of chilled white.",
          "We visited at the end of the day. From a shop / market perspective, very few of the shops were opened, only about 1 out of each 7-8. The food section was opened and had about 8-9 stalls along the seating area. But... there are two issues with this place. First is a major",
          "Beautiful building by the river and amazing market to visit selection to see of fresh fish i was impress plenty of cured meat , and yummy spanish foods las tapas to eat and nice atmosphere. easy to reach by tram",
          "Fresh produce in a beautiful building. Each stall specialises in a produce eg meat, chicken even just olives or eggs. Fabulous. We had our own apartment so enjoyed going to the market to buy fresh produce. Stall holders very friendly and happy to help. Quite cheap as well.",
          "We wondered whether to go there. It was Saturday night and they said it was only open till 15:00. What a surprise! A food court is open till late night. Along with a great atmosphere, you can find there a variety of tapas (local name: pintxos), and drinks. Do not miss the",
          "This is a very good set-up. Common ground where one can go, buy different pinchos from different bars, and sit in down and enjoy a longer lunch, which the 4 of us did.",
          "Market with Great small restaurants and a few shops. Great place for eating or relaxing with a drink near the river.",
          "We were in Bilbao for the weekend, and hadn't booked breakfast at the hotel so we took a walk through the market and found some very good places for coffee/breakfast, at reasonable prices and with quite a good, busy atmosphere. The market itself has typical food stalls, some of",
          "Okay not terrible but fial to understand how the other reviews ate it so highly. A bit anteseptic inside like a second rate airport lounge.",
          "Great pintxos, amazing views and good prices! La Ribera Market is one of the most beautiful places in Bilbao and it's a \"must see\".",
          "The market is mainly full of food stalls - fish, meat, vegetables, fruit, sweetmeats, etc. Fascinating to see the variety of produce on sale. There are also bars and food outlets, with tables to sit at, eat, drink and relax. Right beside the river and a good place to visit.",
          "We loved this place if nothing more for the bars at one end, you can easily spend a relaxed evening, or breakfast in this place as we did. the Breakfast options are amazing so much to offer and so so so cheap. We spent and eveingin in there as well enjoying the tapas and Gin,",
          "We came upon La Ribera Market by chance whilst enjoying a stroll round the Bilbao's old town. The market itself was closed, fortunately the food court was open. It has an amazing collection of booths selling an incredible array of Pintxos, not only do they look great they taste",
          "Get there early to see a fantastic selection of fresh food. Nice eating area on first floor but nothing special. There are more relaxing open air eating places in the old town do try them.",
          "We found this place just by chance on our first afternoon. The building is bright and spacious. Each of the stalls had fantastic Pintxos. We settled in the front by the window with River view and enjoyed the most delicious food and typical Vasco\u2019s wine Txakoli",
          "We started our visit by browsing the stalls for fresh produce (which looked extremely good), canned and bottled foodstuffs, and others selling fresh-caught fish. Following that we descended to the food court where there several stalls selling pinxtos (hot and cold), ceviche and",
          "Maybe if you are going to buy your grosery or fruits is OK but if you want to try something typical from Bilbao... Not many options, actually one of the places sell pizza?? I think that is better if you go to a local bar, will be cheaper also",
          "This place is quite astonishing with all its fishmongers and vegetable stands...... one floor is dedicated to food, one can stop for an hour, and enjoy hundreds of types of pintxos ( the equivalent of tapas iin Spain) here we are in the center of Basque country in Spain,",
          "We visited on a Saturday afternoon after hopping off our bus tour. Sadly we were too late to visit the actual market but the food hall is a must visit. A great place to people watch whilst enjoying the vast variety of pinxtos on offer washed down with a glass or two a Rioja. If",
          "There is a traditional market here and also a food court with several suppliers offering, pintxos, paella, pizza, and much more. We came here for pintxos and drinks twice and were not disappointed. The food court area didn\u2019t shut down for siesta and remains open after 8pm when",
          "The small market is full of Spanish cuisine wonders and the best part is eating at the pitxos bars inside the market. But don't wait to come late, otherwise you will not find a place!",
          "One floor of this old (covered) market is devoted to food - one Pintxos (tapas) bar after another with an amazing selection of food and wine. Lots of seating area too, so you don't have to stand up and eat!",
          "This is supposed to be the second largest fresh market in Europe and it could very well be. It is full of fresh meats, fish, and vegetables as well as other things. The \"shops\" are amazing and you will see some fresh fish that you have ever seen before. In addition, the",
          "a good choice for a quick bite, a glass of wine, a coffee or a martini cocktail. Lots of pintxos, my favourite meal in Bilbao:) the market worth a visit also for its design.",
          "This was a stop we chose on the Hop On Hop Off and I'm glad we did. Just wandering through the array of Pintxos and drinks and lounge like seating was an experience. Even if you're not hungry just stop by and try something. The (food) market itself has a pretty strong fish odor",
          "Huge market full of interesting hustle and bustle. Interesting cuts of meat and all kinds of fish to be seen. Lots of fruits and vegetables, too. My favourite, though, was the stained glass windows, some featuring birds. Near the river. Closes early afternoon, so visit in",
          "Great place to have a look around and maybe purchase a foodie item or two. This is a very modern food market in a very old hall. Wonderful food displays.",
          "The bulk of the market is unprepared fresh foods like seafood, meat and vegatables. A section of it is filled with various Pincho spots. Well worth a walk around!",
          "La Ribera Market is the most turistical market in Bilbao, a city located in the north part of Iberian Peninsula. It is a market, where you can shop all food you need (local and foreign) and also here you can go to eat some tapas, montaditos or some other typical dishes of Bilbao",
          "Nice market. Very clean. The food part has several options to eat, all in one place. The few we tried were good.",
          "Mainly raw food items like butchers or fish mongers. A few veggie/fruit stands. The pintxos hall was quite nice to have a bunch of different bars in one location. Not what we expected for Europe\u2019s largest covered market.",
          "NIce market - great location in the old town, not too many stalls - and overcrowded pintxos places - difficult to find a pace to sit...",
          "Beautiful stain glass on each side of market place. Although market was closed when we were there the pinto places abound with great food and drink. We especially liked the Cava and Spanish Chardonnay",
          "Well worth a visit to join local shoppers find their bargains in the traditional market place. Make sure you visit the upper floor which gets even more authentic. Lots of local produce",
          "Went to this place for breakfast . cafe and coffee bar on 1fl. colorful atmosphere with Pinxo display around. crowed around noon. old town and tram stop is oppsite this market",
          "Good range of pinxtos available from a number of outlets. Busy and vibrant place. Nice place to graze and have a few bites at different stands. Worth a visit.",
          "I lived in Spain and I have been to bilbao many times. However this year was my first time finding the market. It has a good selection of bars to choose from for drinks and pinchxos. This is great for groups, friends and couples to start of their tour of Bilbao. Especially in",
          "I visited here with my grandma a couple of weeks ago. The market is really nice if you\u2019re looking for food or pinxtos but for those looking for non-food type stalls this isn\u2019t the market for you. I probably should have looked it up before hand as I was expecting a large market",
          "Interesting building just outside the old town There are butchers , vegetable and fruits sellers and also seafood Market is clean with 2 levels . There are escalators and lifts . Worthwhile a visit",
          "The upper story is dedicated to a market filled with fish, raw meat, and produce while half of the lower story has numerous cafe/ tapas restaurants to get your fix of \u201cPintxos\u201d (bite size or small plates of traditional foods).",
          "A very large indoor market. There is also an impressive multi-bar section with mouth-watering pintxos. Popular and busy at lunchtime.",
          "Many of the vendors were closed, particularly fish. There was an array of meat processed and raw, but clientele were thin on the ground. Maybe because it was Monday morning. Not worth a visit.",
          "Having visited Madrid & Barcelona, we had high expectations of the market. Perhaps as we visited on a Wednesday impacted our experience, but almost half of the vendors were closed. As a foodie I love to see the variety of foods on offer, but with so few vendors open, this was",
          "As a market, La Ribera is small (despite its reputation) and nothing special. I'm told people enjoy the pintxos and night life but we only ate there for an early breakfast and sere not overly impressed. There are better things to do in Bilbao.",
          "Traditional food market recently renewed with an area of gastro-bars on the first floor, open to a terrace over the river. Historical building once in the Guinness Book housing dozens of vegetables, fruit, meat, fish and seafood stalls. Crowded with local shoppers on saturdays",
          "Wonderful to have a building still used after so many years. Nicely remodeled space with many many meat and fish/seafood stands. As a tourist, great to wander but unless you plan on cooking back at your \u201chome\u201d, there won\u2019t be much to purchase.",
          "We stayed in Bilbao for 5 days and did enjoy this very nice and modern market that des no more than 5 minute walk from our appt. The tapa restaurants on the second floor are worth the retour.",
          "Great choice and value for eating tapas with reasonable prices and busy at weekends with Basque singers on a Sunday.",
          "The building is nice with beautiful stained glass windows. Went on a Monday late morning. Many fresh food vendor stalls were closed. Underwhelmed compared to other European cities we\u2019ve visited. Maybe the problem was that it was a Monday. Great assortment of pintxos bars with",
          "Saturday is the day to visit here and watch the locals enjoy themselves Great choice of food and drinks Super cocktails and OK prices Great place to spend a couple of hours",
          "We went to the Market because we like to eat on the earlier side. We could get pinxtos at 8 pm. They had a large selection of food and drinks but it was tight to find table and chairs to go with the table I found. Getting there on the early side or late is good timing as it was",
          "This covered market is housed in beautiful building is so clean and everything looks so appetising. On the ground floor there are a choice of stalls serving the local pinchos Witte a variety of delicious toppings",
          "After reading this is the biggest indoor market in Europe i was expecting great things...only to be let down. We have visited many indoor markets & this is the worst. Very few stalls & half empty! What probably gives it the \"biggest\" title is the floor full of tapas & snack bars.",
          "Bustling market in the old town. Have a mooch around the market before going to the food hall. Great pinxos especially the crispy belly pork type kebab! Loads of choice for all tastes",
          "It is worth going to just to look at the food. The restaurant area is a must stop and have some food and at least a beer.",
          "We stopped in for some pintxos and local taxoli wine for an easy light dinner. Service is fast and friendly and all the gastropubs have their specialties. Can easily sample fresh market goods for a reasonable price. Not to be missed.",
          "Made me wish I was self catering! The freshest sea food and any cut of meat you could want. The pintos were fascinating in their variety, tried two which were delicious, but partner had trouble eating the one built up as a tower, do you dismantle it or get it all over the face?",
          "Great place to go for a few hours and gorge yourself on a fantastic array of pintxos and wines. Good market for local produce too",
          "We visited on a Saturday morning, in autumn. The fish, meat etc. was amazing - but the fruit and vegetables were beyond amazing. Beautifully laid out, a real feast for the eyes.",
          "Lovely little food market in Bilbao where you can sample traditional Spanish food . Seemed very popular with locals and tourists a like. You can have paella-fish or chicken , fresh fish is on display.",
          "This market is part food-court, part food market. The former was very crowded and noisy, but certainly good for lunch if you like being with people. The latter was absolutely fascinating, with an abundance of seafood, meat, vegetables, bread and pastries presented in a way that",
          "What a great market! Beautiful inside and outside, pretty organized and the colors and food inside are yummy! Go and enjoy!",
          "Opened a couple of years ago in one half of the old market, it\u2019s a great place to try pintxos - each concession serves something a bit different with seating in the middle, so you can try food from several places without moving around",
          "The building is worth visiting but the market itself lacked the atmosphere and bustle of other markets that we have visited in Spain.",
          "nice place where you can find good restaurants or where you can buy meet, fruits.... just sometimes a lot of tourists here .....",
          "Returned a number of times while staying in Bilbao. Easy to try out different Pintoxs .staff friendly and helpful.outdoor seating if the sun is shining",
          "We missed the morning market as we arrived only in the afternoon. The 'eat & drink' section was open so we had drinks. The tables and floor were dirty, spilled drinks, dirty glasses etc. Not very nice.",
          "Good place , fish and food market , nice tapas bars on one side of it . Close to Old City district .",
          "Loved this place. There is a large seating area surrounded by bars selling a huge variety of drinks and pintxos. Highly recommend this place.",
          "This is a huge market that has 2 main components: one for buying raw products if you wanted to take them home and cook with them (meat, fish, veggies, also some clothing stores), and then a food hall with tons of pintxo bars. All of the food we had from the pintxo places was",
          "Apart from fresh food stalls, the right wing on the first floor is a great place to eat pintxos with a glass of \"txakoli\" wine.",
          "This is a market hall with a great variety of fish, meat, fruits and vegetables. The price are very moderate, compared to the place where we live. We enjoyed strolling through the busy isles. Full tour takes about an hour.",
          "Nice place to browse all the fresh food,meat and fish but we most enjoyed the bar area with lots of pinxto bars and some great cocktails",
          "It's claimed to be largest 3-storey covered market in Europe. It has only 2 floors. It's large, not larger than Budapest or Riga's markets. It has couple of cafeterias, few typical fruit-meat-fish counters. Nothing exceptional. Bilbao offers better attractions. Visit recommended",
          "The market is over two levels, and appears clean and full of life. The produce is varied and fresh. The toilets are clean, and the restaurant is large and inviting. Well worth a detour from the old town.",
          "As everywhere else in Spain, always a moment of joy and culinary pleasure to go to this kind of Mercado. Learned a few new things. Service in the eateries was stressed, but who cares when finally sitting in front of the plate and the grapes in the glass...",
          "local fish, meat, ... market; Visiting this market will give u a wide range of the local fish, crabs, mussels, meats as rabbits,... Tip: Get your self bites of pintxos at the enclosed foodcourt or if u are lucky and can cook at your acommodation try fish or lobster :)",
          "I happened to drop by at dinner time and found that there are many pintxo (Basque tapas) bars inside the market. You can order different types of finger-food like \"pintxos\" from different vendors and take a seat with a view of the River. It is a great place to stop by when",
          "We went for a look around on our first day. A very pretty building and lots of produce. We ended up staying for lunch in the food area and great sized portions. Very friendly stall holders. On the second night which was a Sunday we noticed the doors open and revisited as warned",
          "Stopped off here for a glass of vino and some pinxtos on a Saturday afternoon and it was lovely. Food amazing. Wine cheap. Not that big and just a few places to eat but with of variety. Definitely worth a visit!!",
          "Was in the old town and decided to head to the market to pick up some local produce. First level has quite a few stalls serving a good selection of local pintxos and if you need a coffee/quick lunch. On the second level, we took the opportunity to pick up some local cheese and",
          "you can find the best quality of food and really nice places to eat some pinchos , fresh fish and seafood the best meat and great vegetables everything u look for cooking u can find here",
          "Extremely well kept building, with nice restaurants (all serving the local tapas) inside. Prices are a bit high, but quality seems good.",
          "Usually there is a square in the centre of the city for farmers market. Here we have a special building ancient enough for sightseeing (some mosaic, architectural notes) and for food shoping. Located in the ancient part of Bilbao you can at once visit the market and see all the",
          "If you are getting an early start and need coffee and pastries this market has food stalls, plenty of seating and opens before many of the little shops.",
          "The food market itself was pretty functional, whilst always interesting o visit these places for local foods and produce there wasn't as much variety or interest as some I have visited such as in Barcelona, Santiago de Compostela or Borough Market for example. However, on the",
          "Excellent for a good choice of ponchos under one roof. Market functional but not as impressive as Barcelona Boqueria.",
          "The market opens in the evening and there's a good selection of pintxos.. from tradditional to Pizza slices. There's sweet treats as well as savoury. You can buy 6+ and a drink from \u20ac7. It's ideal way of tasting food. We went after 10.30pm after peak time to avoid all the",
          "I have given this a 4 mainly because of the amazing food court area that serves incredible Pintxos, snacks, cakes and drinks. Make this a destination for brunch or lunch as part of your trip. The rest of the market is just an average indoor market that sells pretty much only",
          "We enjoyed a fantastic evening here, sampling different pinxtos from various bars. The food court style layout allows different members of the group to eat from different bars simultaneously. Labels on food and plenty of seating - both helpful for those trying to get to grips",
          "nothing is better than to stop at this market and have plate of pinxos with glass of wine or beer and watch the night river life, enjoy the terrace and listen the slowing city life and reflection of the sunset in the windows across. Great Bilbao experience.",
          "It looks like a mini shopping mall but inside is a treat for a snack or a long drink with amazing choice of pintox n a view of the river! Bit pricey compared to local bars but....",
          "After our first visit we knew this would be our breakfast spot for the week. It only opens in the morning so make sure you get in there early. Great choice of food and the people working there were so welcoming and happy. We loved the food they served and we even managed a",
          "This market has food stalls in the lower levels and pintxos bars on the top floor. There is also a more formal restaurant on site. This is a good place to try your hand at experiencing your first pintxos. Take your plate, grab a beer or a sangria and head outside to the outdoor",
          "If we had been self catering then here is where to buy your supplies. Great for eating out and just soaking up the atmosphere as well.",
          "Completely modern and clean refurbished with all fresh goods you might expect in a food market. Even the pintxo-department is worth a visit and a stop to sit down, have a glass and some pintxos.",
          "This is supposedly on off the largest covered markets in Europe. On the first floor lots of places to eat pintxos. The sellers were mostly butchers and fish mongers. The building is very nice. I would say it is worth a walkthrough. Lacks some of the character of other local",
          "Every city has his marketplace. Ribera is the market in Bilbao ... Nice for a walk or a little snack, but not to compare with markets in other citys.",
          "This is traditional restored market with shops selling fresh produce. It also has an area with a variety of pinxto bars with a common seating area.You can stroll from one to the other and buy what you fancy. We enjoyed a jug of Sangria with paella and some pinxtos. A good place",
          "Well worth seeing if only to rekindle your belief in the benefits of cooking from fresh. So good to see proper ingredients being bought for everyday normal use. That is the way they live. One KFC in town, that we saw, and almost invisible. This place shows why real food is so",
          "Compared to this visitor's former experience, a great place for seeing a wide selection of marine food, among them fish. Interesting to see that so many parts of animals are used, too. There are cafes in the building, so no need to leave hungry.",
          "We also like to visit food markets in European cities for their architecture and displays of local produce. This one is situated on the river front and is a nice walk from the centre of Bilbao. However, the food was okay and the place felt very average - with lots of youngsters",
          "We visited on Saturday morning and had a fun time looking at the fabulous fresh food and then enjoying a coffee in the lovely food court area with lots of little cafes and pintxos bars!",
          "If self catering and near by it was useful to stock up on some goodies but would not make a special visit unless you like to see 2 floors of a good selection of different foods - not that beautiful a building. There was also a section with some good food bars to eat but we",
          "By day the market is worth a look - those fish stalls are a wonder to behold! They are making good use of the lower floors as a social space selling pintxos and other food making this a buzzy place for an evening visit. Glass of decent Rioja t 1.7 euros overlooking the",
          "Our guide told us that this was the biggest food market in Spain. Sorry but I must disagree, this two floor building was ok, with fresh fish and meat for sale, but there was not much else for tourists to sample, compared to Barcelona and Madrid. I had told the young lady I was",
          "Mercado de la Ribera is not like La Boqueria in Barcelona. On the first and second floor, there are stalls that sell fish and meat which are cool to see, but overall only locals would be shopping there. This Mercado shines in the many pintxo stalls and pintxo restaurants that",
          "I had the opportunity to visit Bilbao, and I wanted to take full advantage of all it has to offer. I was able to stop at La Ribera Market on my walking tour. I was impressed with the setting, the ease with which individuals with physical challenges are accommodated as well as",
          "We stopped off here during our cruise and we managed to discover this place randomly. We had a party of around 14 people and there is an area with high benches for social eating. Once we had a table, we set off in various directions sampling various pintxos, sangria (best I",
          "Not to be mistaken with a real market. Some nice varieties of pintxos are offered but it doesn\u2019t have the atmosphere of a bar",
          "Had pinchos here today for lunch. We visited the downstairs a market before which was also excellent. There is an excellent seating area where you can base yourself and then go and chose your pinchos. Lots of places to chose here and all excellent. Great atmosphere and great",
          "Great Pintxos to pair with sangria all together with affordable prices. Clean environment and the food is simple one of the best Catalunya gastronomy experiences.",
          "The Mercado de la Ribera / Bodegon Ribera is a famous, historic covered market built beside the River Nervion. Allegedly it's the largest in Europe and is a huge, attractive stone, iron & glass 'art deco' concoction. With fish on the first level, meat above, and fruit / veg on",
          "We visited a similar market in Lisbon which was far better, however there was a good choice of pintxos on offer, a little dearer than the local bars though",
          "The market part of La Ribera is great - fresh produce, seafood, and meats. However, the best part is the restaurant stalls, with coffee and a wide variety of pintxos. A great place for breakfast and lunch, to watch people walking by the river.",
          "Reputed to be the largest indoor single building market in Spain. In terms of food to eat there or fresh fruit and veg. to take home it would be hard to fault, there is something for everyone. We particularily wanted to see this renovated building, because Bilbao =",
          "Just follow the river from the Arriaga theater and you'll bump on this renovated market place. The lower section is a fancy restaurant, but you aren't for that in Bilbao. You're there for pintxos, the regions specialty, and the ground floor offers a huge array of it. More than",
          "Not the biggest market we have visited in Spain. It had a selection of all food types. Breakfast pintxos selection was good at two of the outlets, you could sit outside and view the river. Most stall holder were friendly bar one who shouted at me for picking up a peach that I",
          "Reading the reviews, I was excited to visit the market. However, I was let down - the hype about the number of stalls, etc. is quite exaggerated. We ate pintxos and pastries, and got mixed service depending on the stall. The toilets were NOT in good states at all (both male",
          "An upmarket market where locals shop and where tourists can see all the amazing food available in this region. Sit down and have a vermouth, a pintxos or just wander around oogling at the beautiful stalls and the produce on offer. Must do in Bilbao",
          "Worth visiting just to see the stunning array of finely-crafted pintxos on display; all at very reasonable prices. I guess all the stalls are competing with each other. For a non-Spanish-speaking tourist, it's also a good place to sample things without having to worry about",
          "Good Food and Drink (everything ) Try to various tapas and drink Guiness. Day and ninght to saturday.In and outside. (not cheap, but good)",
          "This market is fantastic. We visited without much intention to buy stuff and were staggered by the variety, quality and price of the food on offer. There is a food court and bars there too, which offer proper fresh Basque produce (not terrible western fast food). The meat and",
          "First - if you want to eat here get in early. The food and drink are good and fresh. The market is a typical food market usually seen in the streets of a town but here held within a purpose built closed building. Well worth visiting just to see how fresh everything is.",
          "Nice market with a lot of restaurants, cheap and chic, sit at the veranda outside and enjoy a gin tonic in the sub",
          "As said, a two story building with not special architectural nor historical interest located by the Nervion river where some of the famous 7 calles end. The local food market sells fresh goods of good quality, but the bars area is made for touristic purposes and I\u2019ve heard that",
          "The market LA RIBERA is a fine location for shopping fresh food and all kind for a good meal.The little bars for food and drinks are very yummy! Perfect location to sit down, have a drink and eat one or two of the fine little Tappas. Sweets and coffee at its best ! What a view",
          "We walked into the centre on our first morning and when we started looking for somewhere to eat, we were a little overwhelmed in a new city. However as we were wandering around the old town, quite close to the market an old local guy guy told us we should visit. And so we did.",
          "La Ribera Market at Calle de la Ribera is a modern market in town. It is fully air-conditioned with separate storeys of shopstalls neatly displayed internally. It is clean and bright with excellent choice for selling products from fresh food to food court downstairs.",
          "The market is an excellent location to see and buy local produce. Wide range of fresh fish, meats, cheeses and vegetables. The various stall owners are also extremely helpful. So, even after a late night of \"Pintxos\" and \"Txakoli\", make an effort to get up to visit soon after",
          "What a find, excellent choices all round from fish to meats to cheeses, tremendous range to suit all palates.",
          "Lovely place to sample local wines and taste pintxos. It can be difficult to find somewhere to sit so perhaps don't go at peak times. Food was delicious. It can also take time for tables to be cleared away. The only thing we didn't like was the black pudding sausage which was",
          "Great food and wine, excellent atmosphere. Well priced. I visited on a Sunday and it was packed. Go for a small bite or lunch, really nice.",

          "Popped into the market spontaneously to avoid the rain but enjoyed walking around all the fresh food, fish, and meat stalls. Plenty of locals doing their shopping too! Good spot of a coffee, too!",
          "Great market with a good choice of bars serving ponchos. Good atmosphere and a very good range of fresh fish and meats. We love looking around local markets and this one did not disappoint. It\u2019s also under cover if it\u2019s raining, which it does quite a bit in Bilbao!",

          "This imposing building by the river is definitely worth a visit. It houses a very impressive food market selling all kinds of fresh vegetables, meat & fish. The sights and smells really challenge your senses but it was interesting to see the local people throng to buy fines cuts",
          "I arrived Bilbao noon on a Saturday and Tourism office recommended I come before they close at 2-2:30. I found interesting stalls for fish, meat, sausages, fruit and vegetables, mushrooms and peppers, cheese, eggs, and wine. Also an area selling pinxtos that looked and smelled",
          "Had an amazing time in here. Beer and bits of octopus what's not to like. Locals are very friendly if you speak in Basque or very slowly in English.",
          "Yes it's a bit different to the UK but not much. The whole market is full of butchers and fishmongers. Took 10 minutes to see the lot.",
          "Visited this food market twice while attending the European rugby finals in May 2018. Found so many pintxos (tapas) bars offering fabulous food and wonderful wines, including the local txakiol\u00ec, white wine. All the bars were selling wonderful fresh food, fabulous local drinks",

          "We found La Ribera after waking up at 13:30 after traveling for 24 hrs. It was perfect and exactly what we needed. We wandered the food stalls in the market before settling on a few things and grabbing a glass of local wine. There are options here for everyone: I had a delicious",

          "We really had fun, wandering through this huge covered market (110,000 square feet) at the edge of the Nervion River. Stalls fill three levels, featuring beautifully presented fresh food from the area, including produce, fish, cheese, meat and seafood. Myriad shoppers interacted",
          "Colorful, busy and fun! This market has spots to taste a wide variety of \"pintxos\" (Basque tapas). And a wonderful place for those who love local markets for exploring local ingredients. Bustling and a great spot for a couple of hours.",
          "Great place to spend a rainy afternoon eating pintxos and drinking wine. Lovely atmosphere, very convivial and fun. Highly recommend!",
          "Beautiful stained glass, clean bathrooms, great vendors selling lovely produce, fish and meats. If you are taking photographs, this is a must-do. If you just enjoy seeing food in its most elemental form, ditto. Finally, La Ribera Market is a lot of fun.",

          "Very High quality food for very cheap price, so pleasant to sit and eat and drink at your ease, inside or out in the sun.",
          "Great tapas and a good range of vegetarian food. A lot of the bars have signs in English explaining what the dishes are. A lot of the staff also speak English and are able to explain the dishes.",

          "We love coming here and seeing all the wonderful fresh produce for sale, why can't we have markets like this in the UK. Too many supermarkets!! The restaurants here are wonderful particularly the ones serving pintxos.",
          "Visited many markets in Spain and this one is good but not the best I've seen for meat, fish, veg etc. What is the best though is the quality of the pinxtos. Great value. Could stay for hours moving from one stall to another.",
          "Good place to see the hustle and bustle of Bilbao but a little too chaotic and pintxos a little underwhelming",
          "Recently refurbished and you can see the buildings across the road reflected in the new glazing. We were there on a Saturday afternoon when the food part of the market on the top floor is closed, but the lower area had stalls selling a huge variety of pintxos, along with",
          "The fresh produce on sale here is amazing. There is also a great food court which sells amazing local food and drinks. It is open breakfast lunch and dinner well worth a visit very family friendly.",

          "Walked there on a rainy cold day. Expected it to be bigger with maybe more variety. Mainly fish and meat. Olives,cheese and vegetables on a couple of stalls. Bar ,cafe restaurant area nice selection, so best to time you visit to have lunch there. Can get tram outside that takes",
          "This gives a great insight in to how people from Bilbao shop with several fresh fish counters and butchers. There is also a great range of cafes close by with a multitude of pinchos for sale. Recommended, although not for the squeamish as there are some seriously ugly fish and",
          "Was disappointed with the food here. Food had been sitting out and some stalls didn't even heat up the food once you made a purchase, which made the food unpalatable. We only went because we heard good reviews. Disappointing.",
          "We happened upon this market while looking for something else. Welcome surprise. It would be an excellent place to pick up fresh food if you were self catering. As we were not we enjoyed the food and wine in the seated area. Nice to sit outside if you got a nice day. Bathrooms",
          "This used to be the old market place of Bilbao. It has been restored to a very good standard and it is exactly that/ market place, where you can buy fresh cheese , fish, meat, fruit and veg, etc. it has few nice places where you can order a drink and tapas, sit on the terrace",
          "The food outlets were open on the Sunday morning but nothing else. Had some delicious pintxo and a coffee. Nice little place to stop off. The stained glass window at the entrance was a particular highlight.",
          "Cadiz market much more interesting, St Miguel in Madrid more upscale, Platea better with diverse shops.",

          "Visited about 2pm and quite a lot of the stalls were in the process of tidying up and finishing for the morning, having opened up at 8am. However there was still a wide variety of food with stall selling many local delicacies, such as ham, sausage, chorizo, and cheeses. Yes it",
          "i enjoy a market, but although the building is modern and fresh, it makes the market a bit too clinical for me. Very samey and a locals market, as the queues for the fish and meat counters had many housewives getting their fare. not much variety either, fish , meat, and veg.",
          "Very beautiful place and a nice spot to eat pintxos. I recommend to arrive early if it is a large group",

          "The place was busy, loud and full of life, as you expect any open market to be! At lunchtime, there was a great selection of tapas and different foods to choose from. It was really great. The toilets were a bit seedy, but otherwise, this was a great place to get food.",
          "Fantastic pintxo bars on the ground floor and lovely fish meat and vegetable stalls upstairs. I wish I could have filled a suitcase with produce to bring home",
          "We bought ( 50% cheaper than at home) very tasteful cheese and some beef. Beel in Basque region is fat but delicious!! The market is not flooded with tourists like in barcelona.",
          "There are a ton of tapas to be had at the back hot food section. They all look super delicious. I think the quality is so good because they can source their material right next door.",
          "We visited to see all the food stalls, it is a place of drama, chatter and is busy. Seeing all the foods is a treat. Ground floor has loads of food stalls with tapas and wines etc. Massive choice and all fresh. Great for a lunch or brunch. Many cheeses, meats, fish, so much to",
          "It's nice to take a visit and look at all the food and taste some. But i have seen much nicer places like this in Valencia, Barcelona and Madrid.",
          "It is always interesting to se a farmers market. This market had lots of fresh seafood, fish, lamb, beef. A lot of local cheeses were available as well. One end was all market and the other end had food booths.",
          "Good selection of eateries on the ground floor plus food stalls but im not sure who would buy food here. It seems more targeted at tourists than locals.",

          "We returned several times to partake of coffee and superb croissants in the morning (and to look around and buy produce from the stalls) and to taste the most exquisite pintxos in the late afternoon/ early evening. OMG, what an assault on the senses this place is! It offers the",

          "This is a great little market with different stalls offering a range of pinchos and great wines. We stopped off here on two separate occasions to plug the hunger gap and to enjoy the pinchos on offer. We loved that it was right along the river. It's great for some people",
          "We have visited many of these food markets in Spanish cities and whilst not as good as our favourite in Madrid this place is really worth visiting. It gets very busy in both the shopping area and in the tapas/pintxos bars . There is a great variety of traditional basque food at",
          "We went on a Saturday, and the place was bursting to the seams. The fast food area was full of people too, enjoying coffee, beer, and everything else available. A must see for tourists.",
          "This is a large market, full of life and sights and sounds of a typical food market. Busy on a Saturday morning when we visited after breakfast and strolling to top of the old town. Beautiful stained glass windows, worth a stop to take several photographs. A clean, inviting",

          "Definitely worth the visit! Good tapas and affordable prices. Don\u2019t get there too late (ater noon) since it gets rather difficult to get a table and you will have to experience the place standing (ok for young couples, not if you are with elderly people).",

          "When you visit La Ribera you could be mistaken if you see it as one of the best fish markets in Europe or a flower market or a gastro plaza with loads of good places to eat and drink. The local city dwellers make the most of all three. So good are the markets that the place is",
          "I went La Ribera market this morning and if you are looking for a bustling local market you will be sorely disappointed. It is set in a lovely early 20th century building but inside it's been transformed into a collection of upmarket cafes selling pinxtos and pastries with a",

          "Wonderful (and cheap!) pintxos and a glass of local wine on the riverside terras: there is no greater way to start a holiday! Check out the many stands with produce, and don't forget to pick up some snacks.",
          "If you have been to the Bocceria in Barcelona or the Market in Florence then you will be disappointed with this market. If this is the first European market that you have visited then you may be more impressed. Mixture of eating places and meat/fish/vegetable outlets. We had",
          "This is a lovely market to visit - even if just as a Tourist. The fish and shellfish stands are clean and beautifully displayed - saw things I had never seen before. Lots of cheese and cured meat and of course all the fresh produce- both meat and veg. Remember siesta time",

          "Beautiful closed market place on the banks of Nervion river in Bilbao. Even if you are only a tourist and will not cook during your stay, you will feel the pulse of the city here and can taste the local produce first hand. The place itself is very clean and stalls leave enough",

          "This place operates like a food hall and is very popular with the locals. The food is excellent and the drink is of a reasonable price IMO. It's a busy noisy place and there's outside seating on the terrace overlooking the river. Two large TV screens were showing the local",
          "It is really worth walking round the market first thing in the morning to see the food on the slab. We were sorry not to be self catering when we saw the variety. The downside is that some tapas are expensive - a bit of a tourist trap.",
          "Not only is it worth the journey to admire all shapes and sizes of fruit, veg, fish, meat etc. but the eating area is a must. Several cafes here all serving a wonderful amount of tapas and if you are lucky enough to find a table you can take it outside to a seating area on a",
          "Beautifully restored and now very modern functional market. I wish I had a place like this to shop every weekend, as the locals seem to. Interesting place to walk around (without shopping) and some great places for lunch or breakfast.",

          "We stumbled across this market whilst wandering aimlessly around Bilboa. Walking through the door you get bombarded by the amazing scene of colour, noise, smell. We wandered around and stopped for a couple of glasses of wine and some Tapas including Barnacles!",
          "We visited several times on our stay. A real foodie experience topped off by great pintxos & txakoli. Beautiful building by the river.",
          "After coming from Barcelona where the city market was absolutely overwhelming, this market was a little scarce by way of purveyors. It has one of everything, but make sure the tapas you try are fresh. We got there late and the fried tapas were oily and tasted old. . . So get",
          "We were blown away by this building, so sympathetically restored, still functional but modernised and very clean. The stained glass windows are beautiful. The market food all looked enticing, and the bars and cafes were serving wonderful snacks.",
          "It is by far one of my favourite spots in Bilbao. Even though it gets crowded, I really like grabbing a bite and a glass of cooled txakoli. The prices are fair and the food served in pretty nice.",

          "We identified this ahead of our visit, and enjoyed it thoroughly. As visitors to Spain, it gave us an excellent insight to Spanish fresh food, and the passion of the owner-operator market vendors. Food tasting (and wine) is a major reason for coming to Spain, and we found it",
          "Visiting this market is nothing but pure joy. Fresh produce and food, polite and patient vendors give a good idea about everyday life of the locals.",
          "Just down on the river the market is housed in a new building on the edge of the old town. As all markets are, this one is very interesting, we love to see how things should be done athome instead of everyone buying their food at the big supermarkets. Fresh, quality food",
          "Oh my gosh...my eyeballs popped out seeing all these delicious 'pinchos' (finger food...basically). Didn't know what to eat first and where \ud83d\ude15. Anyway, mercados are always nice to visit. Not only delicious but the presentation. A 'work of art'. Art doesn't only have to be on",
          "Very fresh food , esp fish, meat and vegetables and a large place to wine and dine. Nice food. We loved the place",
          "A beautiful market by any standard. The food on display was of an extremely high quality & variety & everything was spotlessly clean. The food stalls on the ground floor provide wonderful food & drink. It is not primarily a tourist attraction as in some other cities.",
          "We went for lunch and managed to get a table relatively quickly in the open food court style area. Pintxo was okay but not great and you can certainly get better in Bilbao. Still it was cheap and worth a visit. Would probably be better in the summer when sitting outside along",
          "Went first thing with my partner to explore and it is a beautiful building to walk around. We didn't spend much time, but did enjoy some coffee and pastries/pinxos at some cafes/kiosks on the first floor. Food was good and fresh, with plenty of places to sit. A decent number of",
          "The old market has been transformed in a kind of mixture of food market and small food bars. it is vivid, lots of locals there too, and very nice pinxtos and other small bites. You could stay there till closing time... Mind to ask for a crianza wine instead of a red wine.",
          "If you want to see this market in full swing, avoid it during August when most of the vendors are on vacation. Food court area is the place to go. If you want to try out pintxos but are not sure how to go about it in the many city bars, this is a good place to practice. Order",
          "The numerous fresh meat and fish vendors, while obviously a staple for the locals, provide an enjoyable area for the tourists to pass through. It was the food purveyors that provided the real culinary appeal of the Mercado. On the main floor you will find at least two-dozen",
          "Loved it purchased some fruits very nice place by the river. Nice eateries. Beautiful floor and stained glass",

          "We didn't realise that you could also eat in the market. We found a great place to have pinxtos and wine and it was really buzzing. Would definitely recommend and wished we had found this place sooner!",
          "Not even markets across Scandinavia are so sterile and souless like this one in Bilbao. And this is Spain. You expect a lot of buzz. Well, not at Mercado de la Ribera. Not worth visiting.",
          "On a walking tour of the city, we went in the market. It is filled with lovely stained glass. There are stalls for buying anything you could possibly want if you have a way to cook or for picnics. The market is along the river, so there are nice views from the outside. It's",
          "The building is more interesting than the market itself. Lovely windows. Go up to the second floor for a good look. On the first floor you can sample some local fare with the option of taking a table outside.",
          "A safe haven to take a rest after long walk, pick up the tapas you like and sit down, drink a beer or wine. Really clean and well organised.",
          "This market is full of different traders, with lots of different things on offer. It looks modern but still has a community feel.",
          "We popped in just wondering what the building was and so glad we did. The market itself was closed but the snack bars were open and the place was buzzing. We had several pintxos (Basque Tapas) and some beer, all bars have different types. Definitely worth a visit!",
          "Gorgeous building located near the old town. Great market to grab some tapas and chill. Head to Cervecer\u00eda Arambarri for some great croquettas and jam\u00f3n",
          "The Ribera is easily reached via Bilbao's tram system. It's a stunning building with a stained glass roof - it's worth visiting just to see the windows! The produce on sale is astonishing, so this is a must see for foodies. About a quarter of the building is home to lots of",
          "We love city markets and visit as many as we can while on vacation. Some markets have excellent eat-in counters, such as the Time Out market in Lisbon. Some offer wide varieties of olive oils and spices to purchase (Valencia, Barcelona). This is not one of those markets. Lovely",
          "Great 2 story market to especially check out the bounty of seafood this area has to offer. Be sure to visit the 2nd floor too where you can find vendors of fruit, vegetable, bread, ham and cheese and more. The market also host a Pinxto food court. The Pinxto/tapas places are",
          "it is to see seafood !! and ham and Tapas restaurant. All look just delicious. The Tapas places are open until 11pm so plenty of time to try more then one vendor. Best the Tram has it's stop directly in front ( Ribera ). We bought some Iberico ham to bring home, all gone in one",
          "Not much going on when we visited. Seriously renovated, but become a bit characterless in the process. Still great place to get pintxos, a wine and have a long chat.",
          "Be sure you have a good amount of cash, to buy food and drink from a few different sellers and get to taste a bit of everything. It's affordable, but most cannot break big bills.",
          "Called in here mid-afternoon for lunch on a recent trip to Bilbao. It's similar to lots of other gastro-markets of this type that can be found in many cities now in Spain and Portugal, if a little smaller. You have the main seating area in the centre and lots of eating and",
          "Experience the newly renovated Ribera Market. If you are a food lover, this is a VERY good place to see, smell and feel the vegetables, meat and fish. Be sure to have some tapas in one of the tapas bars before shopping your dinner ;-). Low activities on sundays and mondays ( and",
          "Probably the best place for seafood tapas in Bilbao city .... Take the time to go there and enjoy a relaxing moment.",
          "Very disappointing as a market. However, downstairs there are tapas resaurants that are excellent. Would go for that.",
          "An interesting building, well located in the old center. During our lunch visit, it was very busy and hectic to get some food. For Pintxos lovers, a must go.",
          "It's dubbed as largest indoor market in Europe but didn't seems to be in my opinion. Lots of fish and meats but not so many choices for tourists pintxo eats.",
          "The market is on 2 levels. Situated next to a river bank, the building itself looks very well constructed, with beautiful stained glass around it. It is a very clean and well-ventilated facility, with everything you could desire for in a market - seafood, meat, vegetables,",
          "A food court is the best way to describe this but there is lots on offer and it is very glitzy. we ate there twice",
          "Lovely market (the fish section was closed when we visited as it was a Monday). Great area to sit and enjoy a glass of wine and pintxos!",
          "This is a very nicely restored old market building located on the banks of the Nervion River at the edge of the Casco Viejo (old town centre). It is home to a variety of fish, meat, cheese and fruit and vegetable stalls as well as a large section packed with some superb tapas",
          "If you're in the Casco Viejo in the morning (before noon) you should definitely take a look at the market. Local people go there to buy their fresh fish, meat, cheese. Lots of different stands with all kinds of products. There's also a bar on sound level with nice views to the",
          "Just when we thought we may have had enough of pinxtos we entered la Ribera market. Slightly more expensive than many we had sampled. Approx 1.8-2 versus 2 euro elsewhere. It is definitely worth the extra! It had an extremely vibrant atmosphere with a selection of bars and food",
          "Lovely building. Great market - lovely to see all the great Spanish food on display. Not everything is cheap but the quality is great.",
          "Well worth a visit for the pintxos bars, as there's a really nice seating area, and displays of delicious looking pintxos. We stopped for a morning coffee and pintxo at Arambarr which is the biggest of the bars, but the others all looked great too. It was so nice we went back",
          "It's a nice market but the energy dies down when the farmers market closes. Get there in the morning for more choices and more fun",
          "The building sits on the side of the river and houses the fresh food market for the locals. If you like wandering around looking at all the different produce when you visit somewhere then this is for you. On the other side of the building are the restaurants serving pintxos.",
          "This large covered market is located on the river bordering on the Casco Viejo (old city). It has clearly been renovated within the last few years as it was reasonably well laid out, had good looking market stall shop fronts and was pretty clean. At one end of the building",
          "Looks appealing from the outside and could have great potential, however it is a bit out of the way and does not have the same feel as the laneways across the road. We had no idea what the building was, so some signage would not go astray. It looks like the shops and food",
          "It was great to escape the heat to Ribera market.Lot of places where to pick some wine and pintxos and enjoy.Be hungry when you go.",
          "A very diverse market, we bought our ham here to take home. (Not cheap, but very good.....) The fish market is especially busy, but as we were staying in a hotel we didn't need it. Worth a visit and especially as its bang opposite the medieval quarter, the 'seven streets' which",
          "Coming from Cork city it's difficult to find a market as superb as ours. The Ribera market is clean, perfectly laid out, perfectly presented. If I was a resident of the city I would love the hygiene and perfection. As a tourist I admire it but I wouldn't be rushing back to see",
          "We went to the market just after visiting get the old town. We had tapas and a drink and we're entertained by live music,a lovely way to have lunch.",
          "We enjoyed seeing the variety of produce on sale. You could enjoy a pleasant tasty lunch and admire the beautiful decorative windows at the same time. Outside is magnificant view of the river and attractive, colourful houses on the other side.",
          "Having your lunch, eating fresh seafood tapas at very reasonable price, this place it!!! Also I bought my belo belota jambon on the 2nd floor where the price is almost half of that of corte ingles.",
          "When we travel, we like to go to the open market of the city that we are staying. La Ribera is large and clean, it is also more modern and does offer a number of cafe options. It did not have the old feel to it that the market of Valencia has though.",
          "The market is in two halves: one half deals with raw meat, fish and cheese. The other is tapas bars. The market is used by the locals and is not just the preserve of the curious tourists. I bough genuine \"Ibercio\" sliced ham, and a cheaper ham from Teruel. Also olives and",
          "Highly recommend a visit to this market, even if you just want to take a look. If you are staying in an apartment, buy your groceries here for your holidays! If not, go there and get some bread, cheese, jamon etc and have a pic-nic on one of the benches outside. There are also a",
          "A good variety of foods are for sale, but the real delight is the food court where you can get cheap pintxos and drinks, mix with the locals, and listen to a band.",
          "Worth a visit, great food and drink and a fantastic friendly vibe. We ate there and visited the market upstairs too. Would recommend and go again.",
          "We went to look at the food in the market which was great, however the true delight were all the pantxos for sale. Truly amazing, I wish we had been hungrier. We went around 11.30am so it was quiet, but still great. A definite on a trip to Bilbao.",
          "This is just a market used by the local folks and is nothing special for the tourist. Toilets were pretty bad.",
          "A food lovers heaven visiting this grand market in the old town part of Bilbao. Fresh fish, veg, meat etc are displayed neatly for the locals to purchase. Worth a visit on the outskirts of the old town.",
          "you can enjoy the famous Pintxos of Bilbao with a wide variety, only problem is the place smell fish a lot",
          "This place offers a variety of different restaurants and bars in one location. It is a good alternative to the several pintxos restaurants (which most of them are good as well) and offers good quality food and drinks at affordable prices. You can enjoy the view at the river on",
          "A huge and fascinating \"farmers'\" market. Live music outside and another group in the food plaza, where there is an endless variety of tapas, hot dishes, snacks, beer, wine, at least one full bar, and a wonderful variety of non-alcoholic drinks; so you can plan a visit around",
          "As this building is adjacent to the edge of warren of narrow streets that make up the old town it is worth taking a look inside. Two floors of traders selling mostly fish and meats with the noise and activity you would expect from a local market. The building is modern and",
          "We were looking forward to visiting this market, mistakenly thinking it would be like the one in Barcelona. Unfortunately it has been modernised and in doing so has lost any charm that it probably had. There weren't that many stands open and it felt very businesslike.",
          "walking through casco viejo this wonderful market on the river houses the market in Bilbao. There are places to get pinxtos; the version of tapas in Basque country, as well as fresh food, cheese, wine, fish, etc. Worth a visit. But check the hours because like most of Spain",
          "It is located in nicely renovated hall. The market is definately a must in Bilbao. Look at hundreds of snacks, take some of them + glass of bear or wine and sit outside overlooking the river and breath fresh air. Good place for relax during visiting / sightseing of Bilbao.",
          "The choice is amazing - eat and have a glass wine and move to the next stand....some places have seats. Great meat and seafood to purchase and take home for cooking.",
          "We'd been recommended this by a few people, and left underwhelmed and glad that we hadn't gone out of our way to visit. Good working market, but nothing exceptional.",
          "We visited this market at lunchtime to view all the fantastic fish and fruit and veg stalls, but also to have lunch in the centre, we were not disappointed, the food was excellent, and we were treated to fantastic live music too.",
          "Located next to the river, La Ribera market is a pleasant and wonderful place to sit around and enjoy your pintxos. A great selection of pintxos to choose from all day. In addition, there is a morning market for fresh produce.",

          "I went to Bilbao a few days on vacation with my wife and we found there a great varieties of marisco -squid, clambs, octopus, shrimps, fish...- all very fresh and good price too. Also the meat you buy there is portioned at the moment, and people also give you nice cooking tips",
          "Came across this indoor market while exploring Bilbao old town. Very big but seemed to be full of cafes and not so much a traditional market.",
          "Lots of interesting meats and fish on sale. Saw a pig foetus and the biggest steak I ever saw. Loads of nice places to eat. Go",
          "You can see from the local public that this is NOT a tourist trap. The food products for sale had very good value for money. Much better than San Sebastian.",
          "We came in here on a rainy Sunday lunchtime. Unfortunately the produce market was closed (which you would expect ) but the eateries were mainly open. A very good choice is to be had. A fantastic place to eat, with really high quality ingredients. Seafood obviously a speciality.",
          "Go there for best street food in Bilbao. Cod, octopus and crab are always nice with a glass of white.",
          "a very nice place for quick or slow food. they offer all the local specialities, very good tastes at reasonable rates. Try all the pinxos with fish, meat, vegetables! traditional atmosphere and when the weather is good sit in the tables outside with river view!",
          "I gave this a 3 star average score mainly because as much as we loved this market only half of the stores/stalls were open and we visited on two separate occasions a Friday afternoon and a Wednesday. The food stalls that were open offered an amazing array of Tapas. There was a",
          "A very local market and a nice place to have dinner. The place has open terraces with nice restaurants. Also the location of the market is quite different - on the river like a huge boat.",
          "We expected more from this market given the fact that this is a large building with 2 floors. However, there are bars which serve some great pintchos at reasonable prices! One bar even served Belgian beer on tap. We have been at some pintchos bars in San Sebastian and Bilbao and",
          "Market not the largest or most interesting in Spain. Two floors with mainly meats and seafood, perhaps there is more once the harvests come in. Worth visiting since on the edge of old town and the Tapas was some of the best and most resonable we have had.",
          "One great thing to do in ANY Spanish city is visit their food markets - they really give you a taste of the city. This one is housed in a simply beautiful building and as usual with Spanish markets, the food on display is simply divine. Nice cafe area with a variety of pintxos",
          "Very disappointing, there may have been a lot of stalls at one point but I think those days have gone. Lacks a real market atmosphere.",
          "Allways great to visit a local market with excellent foodstuff on sale. The basque country is the best.",
          "Such a great place to walk around. All the fresh produce, meat fish and vegetables but the best part was the bar and tapis area. Everything was 2 euros for the plate and the variety was amazing. We had red wine, at a euro per glass, with our lunch! Very civilised? Don't miss",
          "Fresh and excellent pintxos and sangria too. A real treat with Piparra peppers! Enjoy the market but don't miss this little stop.",
          "This place may be the largest market, but it is only partially occupied. Some locals do shop here--good to pick up market produce but not that exciting to visit.",
          "Great place to have lunch and not too crowded either. The pinxtos were excellent as well as the wine choices.",
          "Even if prices here are a bit higher than the normal pintxos bar, the quality is outstanding and the atmosphere very pleasant.",
          "It is amazing, particularly for us from UK, to see so much fresh produce on display. It is not as big as some other markets but still plenty to sample and take back. Lots of opportunities to eat and drink while there too.",

          "I visited the Ribera Market last month while I was in the city and I have to say it was a great experience. A market full of fresh goods, fish, meats and fruits! Well worth my time. I was amazed by how beautiful and yummy everything looked in there. I had lunch and also bought",
          "Spent at least 2 hours here just looking at all the fresh produce available. The stalls were amazing fresh fish and seafood amazing. The stall selling pork had everything but the oink for sale. Also a fantastic food hall with so much choice at lunchtime it was unbelievable. We",
          "The market itself is interesting but a bit clinical compared to the one in Barcelona, for example. Beautifully stained glass windows at the top but it's been refurbished and that has removed some of the character. The bar and snack area is really well worth a visit - plenty",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Santiago de Compostela Cathedral (Spanish and Galician: Catedral de Santiago de Compostela) is part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santiago de Compostela and is an integral component of the Santiago de Compostela World Heritage Site in Galicia, Spain. The cathedral is the reputed burial place of Saint James the Great, the apostle of Jesus Christ. It is also one of the only three known churches in the world built over the tomb of an apostle of Jesus, the other two being St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City and St. Thomas Cathedral Basilica, Chennai in India. \nThe cathedral has historically been a place of pilgrimage on the Way of St. James since the Early Middle Ages and marks the traditional end of the pilgrimage route. The building is a Romanesque structure, with later Gothic and Baroque additions.\n\n\n== History ==\nAccording to legend, the apostle Saint James the Great brought Christianity to the Iberian Peninsula. According to legend, this tomb was rediscovered in 814 AD by the hermit Pelagius, after he witnessed strange lights in the night sky. Bishop Theodomirus of Iria recognized this as a miracle and informed king Alfonso II of Asturias and Galicia (791\u2013842). The king ordered the construction of a chapel on the site. Legend has it that the king was the first pilgrim to this shrine. This was followed by the first church in 829 AD and then in 899 AD by a pre-Romanesque church, ordered by king Alfonso III of Le\u00f3n, which caused the gradual development of this major place of pilgrimage.In 997 the early church was reduced to ashes by Al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir (938\u20131002), army commander of the caliph of C\u00f3rdoba. The Al-Andalus commander was accompanied on his raid by his vassal Christian lords, who received a share of the loot, while St James' tomb and relics were left undisturbed. The gates and the bells, carried by local Christian captives to C\u00f3rdoba, were added to the Aljama Mosque. When C\u00f3rdoba was taken by king Ferdinand III of Castile in 1236, these same gates and bells were then transported by Muslim captives to Toledo, to be inserted in the Cathedral of Saint Mary of Toledo.\nConstruction of the present cathedral began in 1075 under the reign of Alfonso VI of Castile (1040\u20131109) and the patronage of bishop Diego Pel\u00e1ez. It was built according to the same plan as the monastic brick church of Saint Sernin in Toulouse, probably the greatest Romanesque edifice in France. It was built mostly in granite. Construction was halted several times and, according to the Liber Sancti Iacobi, the last stone was laid in 1122. But by then, the construction of the cathedral was certainly not finished. The cathedral was consecrated in 1211 in the presence of king Alfonso IX of Leon.According to the Codex Calixtinus the architects were \"Bernard the elder, a wonderful master\", his assistant Robertus Galperinus, and, later possibly, \"Esteban, master of the cathedral works\". In the last stage \"Bernard, the younger\" was finishing the building, while Galperinus was in charge of the coordination. He also constructed a monumental fountain in front of the north portal in 1122.\nThe city became an episcopal see in 1075 and the church its cathedral.  Due to its growing importance as a place of pilgrimage, it was raised to an archiepiscopal see by pope Urban II in 1100. A university was added in 1495.\nThe cathedral was expanded and embellished with additions in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.\n\n\n== Exterior of the cathedral ==\n\nEach of the fa\u00e7ades along with their adjoining squares constitute a large urban square. The Baroque fa\u00e7ade of the Praza do Obradoiro square was completed by Fernando de Casas Novoa in 1740. Also in baroque style is the Acibechar\u00eda fa\u00e7ade by Ferro Caaveiro and Fern\u00e1ndez Sarela, later modified by Ventura Rodr\u00edguez. The Pratar\u00edas fa\u00e7ade, built by the Master Esteban in 1103, and most importantly the P\u00f3rtico da Gloria, an early work of Romanesque sculpture, were completed by Master Mateo in 1188.\n\n\n=== P\u00f3rtico da Gloria ===\n\nThe P\u00f3rtico da Gloria (\"Portico of the Glory\" in Galician) of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela is a Romanesque portico by Master Mateo and his workshop commissioned by King Ferdinand II of Le\u00f3n. To commemorate its completion in 1188, the date was carved on a stone and set in the cathedral, and the lintels were placed on the portico. Finalising the complete three-piece set took until 1211, when the temple was consecrated in the presence of King Alfonso IX of Le\u00f3n.The portico has three round arches that correspond to the three naves of the church, supported by thick piers with pilasters. The central arch, twice as wide as the other two, has a tympanum and is divided by a central column\u2014a mullion\u2014containing a depiction of Saint James. Vertically, the lower part is formed by the bases of the columns, decorated with fantastic animals, the middle portion consists of columns adorned with statues of the Apostles, and the upper part supports the base of the arches crowning the three doors. The sculpture is intended to serve as an iconographic representation of various symbols derived from the Book of Revelation and books of the Old Testament.\n\n\n==== Tympanum ====\nThe arrangement of the tympanum is based on the description of Christ that John the Evangelist makes in Revelation (Chapter 1 v 1 to 18). In the centre, the Pantocrator is shown, with the image of Christ in Majesty, displaying in his hands and feet the wounds of crucifixion. Surrounding Christ is the tetramorph with the figures of the four Evangelists with their attributes: left, top St. John and the eagle and below St. Luke with the ox; on the right above, St. Matthew on the hood of the tax collector and below St. Mark and the lion.On both sides of the evangelists, behind Mark and Luke, are four angels on each side with the instruments of the Passion of Christ. Some are, without touching them directly, the cross and crown of thorns (left) and lance and four nails (right), another the column in which he was whipped and the jar through which Pontius Pilate proclaimed his innocence. Above the heads of these angels, two large groups of souls of the blessed, forty in all. In the archivolt of the central tympanum are seated the elders of the Apocalypse, each holding a musical instrument, as if preparing a concert in honor of God.\n\n\n==== Mullion ====\n\nIn the mullion, the figure of Saint James is seated with a pilgrim's staff, as a patron of the basilica. St. James appears with a scroll which contains written Misit me Dominus (the Lord sent me). The column just above his head with a capital which represents the temptations of Christ. On three of its sides, facing the inside of the temple, two kneeling angels pray. At the foot of the saint is another capital with the figures of the Holy Trinity. Under the Apostle is a representation of the tree of Jesse, the name given to the family tree of Jesus Christ from Jesse, father of King David; this is the first time that this subject is represented in religious iconography in the Iberian Peninsula. The column rests on a base where there is a figure with beard to his chest (perhaps an image of Noah) and two lions. At the foot of the central column at the top inside, looking towards the main altar of the cathedral, is the kneeling figure of the Master Mateo himself, holding a sign on which is written Architectus. This image is popularly known as Santo dos Croques from the ancient tradition of students hitting their heads against the figure for wisdom, a tradition that was adopted later by pilgrims, although steps are being taken to limit access, to stem deterioration from which the work has suffered.\n\n\n==== Jambs ====\nIn the columns of the central door and two side doors, the apostles are represented, as well as prophets and other figures with their iconographic attributes. All are topped with its own capital which represents different animals and human heads with leaf motifs. The names of all the figures are on the books or scrolls held in their hands.\nThe four pillars of the portico are based on strong foundations which represent various groups of animals and human heads with beards. For some historians, these figures are images of demons and symbolize the weight of glory (the portico in this case) crushing sin. Other sources give an apocalyptic interpretation, with wars, famine and death (represented by the beasts) with situations that can only be saved by human intelligence (the heads of older men).\n\n\n==== Side doors ====\n\nThe arch of the right door represents the Last Judgment. The double archivolt is divided into two equal parts by two heads. Some authors identify these heads with the figures of archangel Michael and Christ. For others, they are Christ-Judge and an angel or may indicate God the Father and God the Son. To the right of these heads, Hell is represented with figures of monsters (demons) that drag and torture the souls of the damned. On the left is Heaven with the elect, with figures of angels with children symbolizing the saved souls.The arch of the left door depicts scenes from the Old Testament, with the righteous awaiting the arrival of the Savior. In the center of the first archivolt is God the Creator who blesses the pilgrim and holds the Book of Eternal Truth; to his right are Adam (naked), Abraham (with the index raised), and Jacob. With them are two figures that could be Noah (new father of humanity saved through the Flood) and Esau or Isaac and Judah. To the left of God are Eve, Moses, Aaron, King David and Solomon. In the second archivolt, the top, ten small figures represent the twelve tribes of Israel.\n\n\n=== Fa\u00e7ade of the Obradoiro ===\n\nThe Obradoiro square in front of the fa\u00e7ade alludes to the workshop (obradoiro, in Galician) of stonemasons who worked on the square during the construction of the cathedral. In order to protect the P\u00f3rtico da Gloria from deterioration caused by weather, this fa\u00e7ade and towers have had several reforms since the 16th century. In the 18th century it was decided to build the current Baroque fa\u00e7ade, designed by Fernando de Casas Novoa. It has large glazed windows that illuminate the ancient Romanesque fa\u00e7ade, located between the towers of the Bells and of the Ratchet. In the middle of the central body is St. James and one level below his two disciples Athanasius and Theodore, all dressed as pilgrims. In between, the urn (representing the found tomb) and the star (representing the lights Hermit Pelagius saw) between angels and clouds. The tower on the right depicts Mary Salome, mother of St. James, and the tower on the left depicts his father Zebedee. The balustrade on the left side depicts St. Susanna and St. John and the one on the right depicts St. Barbara and James the Less.A stair allows entrance to the fa\u00e7ade. The stair was made in the 17th century by Gin\u00e9s Mart\u00ednez and it is of Renaissance style inspired by Giacomo Vignola of Palazzo Farnese. It is diamond-shaped with two ramps that surround the entrance to the old 12th century Romanesque crypt of the Master Mateo, popularly called the \"Old Cathedral\".Between the existing plane of the fa\u00e7ade of the Obradoiro and the old Romanesque portal (P\u00f3rtico da Gloria) there is a covered narthex.\nThis fa\u00e7ade has become a symbol of the cathedral and the city of Santiago de Compostela. As such, it is the engraving on the back of the Spanish euro coins of 1, 2 and 5 cents.\n\n\n=== South fa\u00e7ade or das Pratar\u00edas ===\n\nThe fa\u00e7ade of the Silverware (Pratar\u00edas in Galician) is the southern fa\u00e7ade of the transept of the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela; it is the only Romanesque fa\u00e7ade that is preserved in the cathedral. It was built between 1103 and 1117 and elements from other parts of the cathedral have been added in subsequent years. The square is bound by the cathedral and cloister on two sides. Next to the cathedral is the Casa do Cabido.\nIt has two entrance doors in degradation with archivolts and historical tympanums. The archivolts are attached over eleven columns, three are of white marble (middle and corners) and the rest of granite. In the center are the figures of twelve prophets and the Apostles on the sideline. On the tympanums is a large frieze separated from the upper body by a strip supported by grotesque corbels; on this floor are two windows decorated with Romanesque archivolts.In the central frieze is Christ, with various characters and scenes. On the right six figures belong to the choir of Master Mateo that were placed in the late 19th century. The original provision of the iconographic elements was invalidated since in the 18th century numerous images were introduced recovered from the dismantled Acibechar\u00eda facade. A central medallion shows the Eternal Father (or Transfiguration) with open hands and on the top surface there are four angels with trumpets heralding the Final Judgment.In the tympanum of the left door is Christ tempted by a group of demons. To the right is a half-dressed woman with a skull in her hands, which could be Eve or the adulterous woman. This figure is not praying on her knees but is sitting on two lions. The jambs are Saint Andrew and Moses. In the left abutment, the Biblical King David seated on his throne with his legs crossed, translucent through the thin fabric of his clothes, and playing what appears to be a rebec, personifies the triumph over evil and is an outstanding Romanesque work, sculpted by Master Esteban. The creation of Adam and Christ's blessing is also shown. Many of these figures come from the Romanesque fa\u00e7ade of the north or do Para\u00edso (current fa\u00e7ade of the Acibechar\u00eda) and were placed on this fa\u00e7ade in the 18th century.\nIn the tympanum of the right door there are several scenes from the Passion of Christ and the Adoration of the Magi. In one of the jambs is the inscription commemorating the laying of the stone: ERA / IC / XVI / V IDUS / JULLII  Registration follows the Roman calendar, according to the computation of the Spanish era, corresponding to July 11, 1078. An image, unidentified, of a fox eating a rabbit and, against this, a badly dressed woman with an animal in her lap. Supported on the wall of the tower Berenguela appear other images representing the creation of Eve, Christ on a throne, and the Binding of Isaac.\n\n\n=== North fa\u00e7ade or da Acibechar\u00eda ===\n\nThe fa\u00e7ade \"da Acibechar\u00eda\" (Galician name derived from the jet gemstone) is in the Praza da Inmaculada or Acibechar\u00eda, draining the last section of urban roads: French, Primitive, Northern and English through the old gate Franx\u00edgena or Paradise door. The Romanesque portal was built in 1122 by Bernardo, treasurer of the temple. This portal was demolished after suffering a fire in 1758; some sculptural pieces that were saved were placed on the fa\u00e7ade das Pratar\u00edas. The new fa\u00e7ade was designed in Baroque style by Lucas Ferro Caaveiro and finished by Domingo Lois Monteagudo and Clemente Fern\u00e1ndez Sarela in the neoclassical style in 1769, although it retained some traces of the baroque.At the top of the fa\u00e7ade is an 18th-century statue of St. James, with two kings in prayer at his feet: Alfonso III of Asturias and Ordo\u00f1o II of Le\u00f3n. In the centre is the statue of Faith.\n\n\n=== East fa\u00e7ade or da Quintana ===\n\nThe fa\u00e7ade of the cathedral that overlooks the Quintana Square has two gates: the Porta Real (royal gate) and the Porta Santa (holy gate). The construction of the Porta Real, baroque, was begun under the direction of Jos\u00e9 de Vega y Verdugo and by Jos\u00e9 de la Pe\u00f1a de Toro in 1666, and was completed by Domingo de Andrade in 1700, who built some of the columns that span two floors of windows, a balustrade with large pinnacles, and an aedicula with an equestrian statue of Saint James (now disappeared), well adorned with decorative fruit clusters and large-scale military trophies. The kings of Spain entered the cathedral through this door, hence its name, and the royal coat of arms on its lintel.The so-called Holy Door (Porta Santa) or Door of Forgiveness (Porta do Perd\u00f3n) is the closest to the steps. It is usually closed with a fence and opened only in Jubilee Years (years when St James's Day, 25 July, falls on a Sunday). It was one of the seven lesser gates and was dedicated to St. Pelagius (whose monastery is just opposite). On this door niches contain the image of James, with his disciples Athanasius and Theodore at his side. On the bottom and sides of the door were placed twenty-four figures of prophets and apostles (including St. James) coming from the old stone choir of Master Mateo. Inside this door through a small courtyard is the true Holy Door, which enters into the ambulatory of the apse of the church.\n\n\n=== Bell Towers ===\n\nThe early towers in the main fa\u00e7ade of the cathedral were Romanesque (current fa\u00e7ade of the Obradoiro). They are called the Torre das Camp\u00e1s, which is situated on the side of the Epistle (right) and Torre da Carraca, to the side of the Gospel (left). The two have a height of between 75 and 80 metres.The first part of the tower was built in the 12th century, but in the 15th century several modifications were made and King Louis XI of France donated in 1483 the two largest of the thirteen bells.Due to a tilt that was detected in its structure between the 16th and 17th centuries, the towers had to be reinforced with buttresses, between 1667 and 1670. The towers housing the bells were made by Jos\u00e9 de la Pe\u00f1a de Toro (1614\u20131676) in a baroque style, and completed by Domingo de Andrade. The architecture of the towers has a great effect in perspective with its vertical lines and the sequencing of its floors.\n\n\n=== North Tower or da Carraca ===\n\nIt is located to the left of the fa\u00e7ade del Obradoiro, and was built \u2013 like its partner \u2013 on the opposite side of an earlier tower of the Romanesque period. It was designed by Fernando de Casas Novoa in 1738, imitating the bell towers by Pe\u00f1a de Toro and Domingo de Andrade in the 17th century: baroque decorations adorned all kinds of ornamentation that provided a unifying architecture across the fa\u00e7ade.\n\n\n=== Clock Tower, Torre da Trindade or Berenguela ===\n\nThe Clock Tower, also called Torre da Trindade or, Berenguela, is at the intersection of the Pratar\u00edas square and the Quintana square. Traditionally, construction was thought to begin in 1316, at the request of Archbishop Rodrigo de Padr\u00f3n as a defence tower. After his death his successor, Archbishop B\u00e9renger de Landore, continued work on it, though these dates are questioned by some authors. When he became main master of the cathedral, Domingo de Andrade continued with its construction and between 1676 and 1680 raised it two floors higher; the use of various structures achieved a harmonious and ornamental design, with a pyramid-shaped crown and a lantern as a final element, with four light bulbs permanently lit. It rises to seventy-five metres.In 1833 a clock was placed on each side of the tower by Andr\u00e9s Antelo, commissioned by the Archbishop Rafael de V\u00e9lez. As part of its mechanism it has two bells, one, at the hour, called Berenguela, and a smaller one marking the quarter hours. These two were cast in 1729 by G\u00fcemes Sampedro. Berenguela has a diameter of 255 cm and a height of 215 cm, weighing approximately 9,600 kilos, and the smaller weighs 1,839 kilos with diameter 147 cm and height 150 cm. Both original bells cracked, forcing their replacement. The current replicas were cast in Asten (Netherlands) by the Eijsbouts house in 1989 and were placed in the cathedral in February 1990.\n\n\n== Interior ==\nThe cathedral is 97 m long and 22 m high. It preserves its original, barrel-vaulted, cruciform, Romanesque interior. It consists of a nave, two lateral aisles, a wide transept, and a choir with radiating chapels. Compared with many other important churches, the interior of this cathedral gives a first impression of austerity until one enters further and sees the magnificent organ and the exuberance of the choir. It is the largest Romanesque church in Spain and one of the largest in Europe.\n\n\n=== The P\u00f3rtico da Gloria ===\n\nThe 12th-century Portico da Gloria, behind the western fa\u00e7ade, is in the narthex of the west portal. It is a remain from the Romanesque period, a masterwork of Romanesque sculpture built between 1168 and 1188 by Master Mateo at the request of king Ferdinand II of Le\u00f3n. The vigorous naturalism of the figures in this triple portal is an expression of an art form, varied in its details, workmanship and polychromy (of which faint traces of colour remain). The shafts, tympana and archivolts of the three doorways which open onto the nave and the two aisles are a mass of strong and vibrant sculpture representing the Last Judgment.\nThe central tympanum gives an image of Christ in Majesty as Judge and Redeemer, showing His wounds in His feet and hands, accompanied by the tetramorph. He is surrounded on both sides by a retinue of angels carrying the symbols of the Passion. In the archivolt are represented the 24 Elders of the Apocalypse, who are playing musical instruments.\n\nThe column statues represent the apostles with their attribute, along with prophets and Old Testament figures with their name on a book or parchment. These were all polychromed. The faint smile of the prophet Daniel as he looks at the angel of Reims is especially noteworthy.\n\nThe middle pier represents Saint James, his face conveying an ecstatic serenity. The text scroll in his hand shows the words Misit me Dominus (the Lord sent me). Below him is the Tree of Jesse (the lineage leading to Christ), while above is a representation of the Trinity. It is customary for the pilgrims to touch the left foot of this statue, signifying that they have reached their destination. So many pilgrims have laid their hands on the pillar to rest, that a groove has been worn in the stone.\nThe lateral portals are dedicated to the Jews on the left and to the unbelievers on the right.\nThe right tympanum is divided into three parts and is dedicated to the theme of salvation. In the centre are Christ and St Michael, flanked by Hell (represented by demons) and Heaven (represented by children). Purgatory is shown on the side. The left tympanum shows scenes from the Old Testament.\nDemons are represented at the bottom of the p\u00f3rtico, signifying that Glory crushes sin.\n\nBehind the portico stands the statue of Maestro Mateo, the master architect and sculptor put in charge of the cathedral building programme in the 12th century by Fernando II. It is said that whoever butts their head three times against the statue will be given a portion of Mateo's genius and perhaps enhanced memory. There was formerly a long line of visitors waiting to touch their head against the statue, but it is now blocked off because an indentation started to develop from the repeated contact.\nThe sculptures in this portico were a reference point for Galician sculpture until the 15th century.\n\n\n=== The nave ===\nThe barrel-vaulted nave and the groin-vaulted aisles consist of eleven bays, while the wide transept consists of six bays. Every clustered pier is flanked by semi-columns, three of which carry the cross vaults of the side aisles and the truss of the arched vaults, while the fourth reaches to the spring of the vault. Lit galleries run, at a remarkable height, above the side aisles around the church.\nThe choir is covered by three bays and surrounded with an ambulatory and five radiating chapels. The vault of the apse is pierced by round windows, forming a clerestory. The choir displays a surprising exuberance in this Romanesque setting. An enormous baldachin, with a sumptuous decorated statue of Saint James from the 13th century, rises above the main altar. The pilgrims can kiss the saint's mantle via a narrow passage behind the altar.\nIn the choir aisle the beautiful lattice work and the vault of the Mondragon chapel (1521) stand out. The radiating chapels constitute a museum of paintings, retables, reliquaries and sculptures, accumulated throughout the centuries. In the Chapel of the Reliquary (Galician: Capela do Relicario) is a gold crucifix, dated 874, containing an alleged piece of the True Cross.\n\n\n=== Crypt ===\n\nThe crypt, below the main altar, shows the substructure of the 9th-century church. This was the final destination of the pilgrims. The crypt houses the relics of Saint James and two of his disciples: Saint Theodorus and Saint Athanasius. The silver reliquary (by Jos\u00e9 Losada, 1886) was put in the crypt at the end of the 19th century, after authentication of the relics by Pope Leo XIII in 1884.\nThroughout the course of time, the burial place of the saint had been almost forgotten. Because of regular Dutch and English incursions, the relics had been transferred in 1589 from their place under the main altar to a safer place. They were rediscovered in January 1879.\n\n\n=== Botafumeiro ===\n\nA dome above the crossing contains the pulley mechanism to swing the \"Botafumeiro\", which is a famous thurible found in this church. It was created by the goldsmith Jos\u00e9 Losada in 1851. The Santiago de Compostela Botafumeiro is the largest censer in the world, weighing 80 kilograms (180 lb) and measuring 1.60 metres (5.2 ft) in height. It is normally on exhibition in the library of the cathedral, but during certain important religious holidays it is attached to the pulley mechanism, filled with 40 kilograms (88 lb) of charcoal and incense. In the Jubilee Years (whenever St James's Day falls on a Sunday) the Botafumeiro is also used in all the Pilgrims' Masses. Eight red-robed tiraboleiros pull the ropes and bring it into a swinging motion almost to the roof of the transept, reaching speeds of 80 kilometres per hour (50 mph) and dispensing thick clouds of incense.\n\n\n== Other burials ==\nAlfonso Daniel Rodr\u00edguez Castelao, at the Pante\u00f3n de Galegos Ilustres (\"Pantheon of Illustrious Galicians\"), Bonaval\nFructuosus of Braga\nRosal\u00eda de Castro\nFernando P\u00e9rez de Traba\nFerdinand II of Le\u00f3n\nAlfonso IX of Le\u00f3n\nPedro Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro\nGaspar de \u00c1valos de la Cueva\n\n\n== Old images ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nAsturian architecture\nCatholic Church in Spain\nSantiago de Compostela\n12 Treasures of Spain\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\u00c1lvarez Mart\u00ednez, Rosario (2002). \"Music Iconography of Romanesque Sculpture in the Light of Sculptors' Work Procedures: The Jaca Cathedral, Las Plater\u00edas in Santiago de Compostela, and San Isidoro de Le\u00f3n\".

          "The cathedral is being renovated but the exterior has detailed carvings and you can still view parts of the interior. You can line up to \"hug\" St James, although be patient-or visit early- as the lines can be lengthy. Don't forget the wonderful Cathedral museum which is",

          "From the outside this is a truly magnificent building and the square outside was full of pilgrims at the end of their trek to the cathedral. That whole thing is an experience in itself. Sadly for us most of the interior was cloaked in polythene sheeting as major restoration",

          "We stayed for 3 nights. The old city is beautiful, the architecture is something to behold. The cathedral is vast and very ornate. This is also the city where the Camino de Santiago ends. We saw thousands of walkers finishing their hike. Families reunited, singing, clapping and",
          "Saw the cathedral from the exterior only...and at night. It was just jaw-dropping to see the detail on the cathedral and how massive it is. I wish I was there during the day to go inside. The exterior did have some scaffolding for renovations. Which must be done to preserve",
          "You would expect a building of the international importance of the cathedral to receive 5 stars, and normally it would, but most of the interior is covered in scaffolding, so as an experience it is very disappointing. The outside is magnificent and you can still see one",
          "Apart from the renovations lots of people lined up to look at the cathedral. I enjoyed it. People were climbing the stairs to look behind the statue of St James.",
          "I gave this a 5 in spite of the fact that it was under construction. I had visited it the year before, and I loved it. It is a special place, and I would recommend it (except when it's under construction).",
          "This is an amazing cathedral. It totally sucks that it's under construction right now but it's incredible anyways. I can't lie: it impressed me more than the Notre Dame. It's really gorgeous and huge but without the gross pompousness of the Vatican. I usually don't like",
          "What can I say, it\u2019s a beautiful Cathedral, very old and very historic. But the most beautiful part of the trek to Santiago de Compostela is the journey, and not the destination. Still, the cathedral is worth seeing and worth visiting.",
          "The Cathedral is under renovation but visit is allowed for tourists. We managed to visit and pray to St James. We were very lucky after 6 days if Camino we made it to Santiago de Compostela.",
          "This highlight of many a visit to Santiago is under major restoration as the roof needed fixing to stop water damage. You can still visit the tomb of St James and visit the Porte de Gloria (for a charge). Apparently the work is due to finish in 2021.",
          "After 800 kilometres, Santiago Cathedral was a complete disappointment purely as the renovation internally has shut off virtually everything. Maybe staged work would have made the pilgrim's experience a bit more worthwhile,?!! As it is, cranes around exterior, nothing left to",
          "Alas the Cathedral was going through a renovation. Fortunately the outside had been done and the architecture eas bold and imposing. Inside there was scaffolding and plastic sheets not much could be seen of the altar. The little I did see I did not enjoy. All the gold and wealth",
          "Stopped here after completing our pilgrimage. The outside has been recently restored but they are now working on the inside. You can still enter from the back side of the building and line up to pay homage to St. James and see a little of the cathedral. They don't allow large",

          "Even though we couldn\u2019t hear mass or see much because the church is completely under construction you can visit the crypt and hug the St James statue which is a tradition. I\u2019m sure once finished it will be beautiful!",
          "The City and the square are wonderful. If not a pilgrim it is very interesting to see and speak to some. The are major renovations going on inside and you weave around the scaffolding which is encased in plastic safety netting, hindering your concept of the building as a whole.",
          "The Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela is a historically and architecturally significant site, but now (fall 2019) is not a good time for a visit. The cathedral is undergoing a multi-year restoration and conservation project and, as a result, the interior is almost completely",

          "The baroque facade is great. It was recently restored. Unfortunately there is very little to see inside as it is going through a major restoration project that will hopefully be completed by end 2020. This is optimistic . Inside it's all scaffolding, wrapping sheets. Even the",
          "Very impressive on the outside and ancillary areas such as the library, but the interior of the main cathedral was shrouded in plastic sheeting and scaffolding so we were disappointed that we could not see the cathedral in all its pomp. The work is likely to continue into 2020",
          "Since our last visit here the front exterior of the Catherdral has been extensively cleaned (& it was badly needed) & what a difference it makes! It's now 100% better than it was & the facinating detail in the stonework is now visible. The light at different times of the day &",

          "The exterior of this cathedral is quite magnificent & it is fascinating to watch the stone changed colour during the day from morning to sunset. The only sadness is that there is major renovation work going on both inside & out at the moment.",
          "They\u2019re currently working on the inside of the cathedral so as you can see from some of the photos there is some construction work on the go. The outside of the building looks amazing. This is my view is a must see item.",
          "The cathedral is an incredible building with its impressive baroque facade and is the culmination for some of a long journey along the Camino to reach Santiago. At the moment it\u2019s best viewed from the outside only as there is major restoration work going on for holy year in",

          "A must see if you are in the area. If you are a pilgrim, you already know what to expect. If you do not know what I am talking about, do a web search for Camino de Santiago. The cathedral itself is beautiful and ornate. An impressive building on an impressive square. However,",
          "A group of friends completed the El Camino walk in Santiago. After 100 miles walked, Santiago was a welcoming city with its many churches and travelers from around the world. The countryside was wonderful and the locals friendly. The cathedral plaza was now home to a greater",
          "Outside of the cathedral was magnificent. The walk through the three levels of the museum to get into the was great. The cathedral is completely under reconstruction on the inside. The lines are long to put your arms around St. James and to see the silver casket with St. James",
          "After walking the Camino, and arriving at the cathedral plaza,stay awhile in the plaza and savour the moment. Dont rush to get the certificate. The cathedral is getting refurbished,but one can still wander inside and hug the statue of Saint James and pay respect to his",

          "We spent a few days in the city and found it to be a treasure in so many ways. Religion aside, (mostly catholic city), it has essentially been at least around since 44 AD. So you need a few days to explore. Let's make it clear that it's not easy to walk around, hills ,stairs",

          "Very beautiful and powerful The architecture and history where overwhelming. The Square abutting an historic university is magnificent",
          "People have come here for seversl centuries just to see or enter what many Christians believe to be either the second or third most sacred religious site in Christianity. I am an atheist, so I prefer not to go into detail here. I really like the rest of the city as well.",
          "Walking into the plaza I was stunned at the size of the cathedral, with so many people gathered after completing their way, quite moving",
          "Santiago de Compostela is lovely, but the key attraction - the cathedral - is a mess. I am surprised that it is still open to the public. Much of the interior is covered in scaffolding and cannot be seen. Much is closed off and the workers are busy making noise. If you had come",
          "Monstrous but amazing. Very impressive. Pity it\u2019s being renovated, so not much to see inside. But the tomb is still there to be viewed. Pilgrims with backpacks and sticks.",
          "We took a wander around the Cathedral which was beautiful- the bits we could see (as it is being renovated so there was a lot of scaffolding and hoarding up). Very ornate within. Will be wonderful once the renovations are complete, but it was worth a visit just for the taster.",
          "We went here as a family and he building is very beautiful. Although as of August 2019 there were lots of building works going on and access was limited. Lots of big queues to see the apostle. The square at the front was busy and energetic lots of very nice restaurants around",
          "Great to finally reach the Cathedral after the long trek from Porto...however, sad that it was all encased in renovation drapes and covering...will need to come back another time to see it in all its glory",
          "Finishing the Camino by walking into this square is truly amazing. The joy & exhilaration of the walk you've just completed culminates to euphoria as you enter this beautiful square. Sadly the inside of this cathedral is currently under extensive construction & restoration so",
          "As we walked nearer the Cathedral I was trying to imagine what it would look like. The streets were narrow and busy and even though we had seen the twin spires from a distance we could not see them now. And then with a few steps forward we were in this amazing square of",

          "The big claim is that it is the repository of the body of St James (San Tiago). It isn't. There is no proof anywhere that these bones belong to Saint James, and a number of books have been written on the subject, including one by Tracy Saunders, a local writer. But what of",
          "If only we were aware that this beautiful cathedral was under construction - our fault I guess. All we can say is that we will return once all the works are complete. Outside are nearly finished. There is scaffolding still to the side. Inside is completely under renovation",
          "Despite the construction indoors, we loved our visit here. The church is gorgeous and it culminated our Camino just beautifully.",
          "Lots of history, superb for both religious and non religious visits. Always a great pleasure to come back",
          "Stunning sight at the end of our 110km Camino. Although the cathedral is under construction, you can still enter parts of it. Definitely a must see in Santiago!",
          "Under reconstruction inside . So you do not see all. Architecture is super nice and old . The 10 minutes line to see the statue of Jacob.",
          "Beautiful Cathedral at an enormous plaza surrounded from middle ages buildings. Outside hundreds of pilgrimages at the end of the Camino de Santiago. The interior is majestic and worth a visit.",
          "I did not walk the pilgrimage road but it was great to see people celebrating when they arrived. The cathedral has a museum attached. The statue and tomb of St. James are of course highlights of going through the cathedral.",
          "Even though renovations are being done the place inside and out is awe inspiring. Well worth the visit",
          "We were able to see this beautiful medieval cathedral on a recent tour of northern Spain. It is the goal of those pilgrims travelling the Camino. It was very moving to watch pilgrims at the end of their journey. The best time for photos is early morning when it is less crowded.",
          "Inside out it is a superb view and experience. Watch people arriving in the square or go inside to see the majestic architecture! Definitely worth seeing!",
          "To see such glorious architecture and storied splendour written about throughout the ages at the end of my pilgrimage was a spiritual experience. A shame that mass was unavailable to attend within the walls this year. But the exploration of the museum was informative and to be",

          "This is a beautiful and spiritual place. A must see, however the inside of the church is being renovated. We were very lucky and went into see the cathedral on a Saturday afternoon and only waited 15 minutes to lay our hands on the St James statue. We also got to see the",
          "Beautiful cathedral with impressive construction details, both outside and inside. Excellent for christians believers.",
          "We got to visit the Cathedral at the end of our Camino. It was a moving moment to hug the statue of St. James at the altar, and then prayer before his relics. We could only see s little of the Cathedral as the was draped with tarps because of the renovation. What we saw was",
          "It was with disappointment that there was restoration work being done inside the cathedral. There was scaffolding and shrouds everywhere. One cohort really get a feeling of what it was like. It seemed quite small, obviously we weren\u2019t able to go to a service in the cathedral.",
          "It is under construction yet it is worth the effort to go there and see the cathedral. There is a nice bookstore at the end.",
          "Certainly was a big walking day to explore the insights of the \"Way of St. James\"..and exciting watching the return of the pilgrims return to the Plaza after their inspirational travels. Beautiful and stunning location with all aspects of culture. Renovations under way what",
          "After walking 500 miles to get here, we wanted some quiet time in the cathedral. This did not seem possible at first but then we were walking by one evening after mass, and noticed almost no one inside! We went in and had a lovely hour seeing and touching everything, almost",
          "Absolutely beautiful cathedral at the end of your Camino. Nostalgic and with mixed feelings, cannot believe the walking came to an end. Beautiful building. Crowded and you need to go back early in the morning for great photo.",
          "The Cathedral is under renovation, but it is so impressive, both inside and outside, that it causes emotions and considerations about the role of the catholic church in the last 2000 years. without this Cathedral, there would be no Santiago Compostela",
          "As a pilgrim walking the Camino, arriving in front of the Cathedral de Santiago de Compostela is quite emotional. Entering the plaza and turning to view the exterior is breathtaking. We wandered through the cathedral and even with the restoration work in progress there was still",

          "This Cathedral is absolutely stunning. You can sit and admire the architecture from the outside. The inside is currently under renovation and the botafumeiro is not in operation. You can visit the bust and grave of St. James. The bishop\u2019s house and museum can be visited for a",
          "After my camino this was a good visit. Although they were busy restorating the place , It was still worth while",

          "IMO, the Cathedral De Santiago de Compostela is what it is all about in Santiago. My wife and I have visited the Cathedral twice now......the first time the outside was covered in scaffolding....the second time the inside was covered in scaffolding. Both times, we didn't see the",
          "I should have checked. The interior is a building site at the moment. The exterior is sublime/ridiculous as we all know.",
          "What a treat to find that after many years of restoration work, both spires of Santiago's cathedral were once again free of scaffolding. The facade facing Plaza del Obradoiro is brilliantly clean and every detail is clearly visible. The Cathedral of Santiago is distinct from",

          "Like all the hyper-inflated displays of Catholic wealth from the Middle Ages, this cathedral is a sight...when they're not performing maintenance and cleaning, as they were when I was here. Nearly everything of interest was shrouded in scaffolding and plastic wrap. I'm sure it's",
          "This is truly a must see, if for no other reason than the swinging of the bottofumeiri. The schedule is rather sporatic and iffy, but after finishing the Camino it must be seen.",
          "This brings you really back into time, unbelievable that men could build this so long ago. Under restauration currently but still worth a visit.",
          "This cathedral is beautiful from the outside. Unfortunately at the moment it is undergoing restoration to be finished in the Holy Year 2021 so although I knew there would be no roof tour and that it was being restored what I did not expect was the total building site inside.",

          "Arrived Tuesday noon. The cathedral is magnificent from tbe outside, even with some cranes and renovation works. From the inside - it's a different story. Most of everything inside is hidden. You can only go to the crypt and watch from distance the coffin with the remains of St.",

          "The interior of the cathedral is currently undergoing extensive renovation work. Unless you enjoy visiting building sights don't bother. Stunning architecture on the outside very dissapointing inside, you simply cannot see much due to dust sheets and scaffolding. Unfortunately",
          "Having done six years of various stages of the Camino de Santiago the entry to the Square is always breathtaking. Majestic cathedral and other buildings with pilgrims from all over the world meeting and hugging. A truly heart touching moment. If you haven't done it - you should",
          "On arriving in Santiago de Compostela at 12:30 on the Tuesday we completed our 85-mile/7-day walk from Baiona, we visited this cathedral first thing. We were hot and tired, but this is an awe-inspiring church, both from the outside and the inside. Unfortunately, it was still",
          "This was our second time cycling along the Way of St. James, this time on the Portuguese way. The Cathedral is a total must, and, in our first pilgrimage, we were in total awe when we finally arrived there in June 2013. We attended the Holy Mass and saw the amazing",
          "It's a cathedral wonder.I recommend visiting the Portico de la Gloria. I recommend to see the museum and also see the roofs of the cathedral. It is also very interesting to visit the Plaza del Obradoiro and the surroundings of the cathedral.",
          "One of the most important cathedrals of the Catholicism, and a great mixture of several architectonic styles, romanesque, gothic and baroque. The Cathedral is located in one of the most amazing squares of Galicia, Obradoiro square, with great buildings all around.",
          "If you\u2019re on Camino words are not enough to describe the cathedral. You will understand and see for yourself. If you\u2019re just visiting, it\u2019s definitely a must in Santiago.",
          "It has a jumble of tall spires that rise above the surrounding buildings. It was built over seven centuries starting in 1075 and you can see the different architectural styles . Much of the interior still was under renovation so you could not see its true beauty and from all",
          "Everything is being renovated. The statues are gone. The whole place is cluttered with scaffolding and work tarps. There\u2019s hardly anything to see and the areas open to the public are restricted. What a waste!",

          "We finally reached Santiago de Compostela with sound of the bagpipe played at the entrance to the compound of the cathedral. There was no scaffolding at the front of the cathedral, but it was still closed for interior renovations. The building is beautiful and full of history.",
          "The Cathedral is glorious \u2014 all that and a bag of chips. It\u2019s well worth the line to see the medieval arches (all gold and gilt) and the crypt downstairs. Highly recommend!",
          "Although under construction, it is still one of the most beautiful cathedrals in the world. Saint James' bones are buried here and it is a worshipers haven.",
          "An architectonic and cultural jewel that it\u2019s worth the visit. Unfortunately, it was under repairs in the inside this time, but we still could hug Santiago and hopefuly, if the tradition works, we will be able to come and hug him again.",
          "The cathedral is beautiful from the outside or the inside. If you were walking a long way to get there, then the effect is doubled.",
          "Visiting Santiago de compestela in conjunction with a walk . The cathedral is undergoing renovations so we probably didn\u2019t see it in all its glory . However the history and stubbing artefacts were wonderful to see .",
          "The openess of the Plaza makes you feel full of joy, many prople coming from the pilgrimage roads are singing, waving, resting, chating, gazing to the Amazing cathedral or people passing by.",
          "Unfortunately when we visited the Cathedral it was being renovated so we weren\u2019t able to appreciate it in its normal state. We were told it was closed but you can go in a side entrance and see parts of the church including St James statue that sits above the alter. You can also",
          "There are very many artifacts to delight one's curiosity and of course it's an essential stop on any Pilgrims' list so not a surprise that it was very busy with visitors. Unfortunately much was not visible because of maintenance work going on but good that it is being cared for",
          "It is worth making the time to visit the Cathedral Museum. It is informative and contains many original artefacts. From the upper level there is also a view of the Plaza and the surrounding roof tops. Note, the roof tours are popular and need to be booked in advance",
          "Very impressive even if interior works are ongoing. We allowed 44 minutes for our visit which is the minimum time.",

          "Just the exterior us enough to pull this place to 5/5 It's NOT just another European church - it's up there with K\u00f6ln, Reims, Notre D\u00e2me Huge plaza that really does it justice - please come check it out",

          "This Cathedral is breathtaking from the outside. It is a shrine for St James the apostle and pilgrims have been coming here for centuries. Note inside is under major construction so really takes away from the whole experience. There is a crypt which houses the remains of St",
          "Only able to visit the tomb of st James of compostela and go to a Spanish mass in a side chapel. So Spiritually enriching. However if you are interested in the internal architecture and the main altar you will be very disappointed this year. Most areas blocked off and covered in",
          "Impressive from the outside but unfortunately inside is under rebuilding so that was disappointing. Mass was held elsewhere for pilgrims so you need to research and plan ahead.",
          "Very impressive structure, beautiful inside, a must visit including attending mass. Priests greet everyone informing countries present.",
          "After years of having its front closed for stones front cleaning, Santiago de Compostela's Cathedral shows magnificent. The only drawback during my mid-April visit was the partial closing due to ceilings restoration in one of the wings. Please visitors beware that during Easter",
          "I will say we did not walk the pilgrimaged trail, unless you count from our hotel to the cathedral a pilgrimaged. We are not religious folks, but we do enjoy visiting these fantastic buildings dedicated to faith. This was the first of many churches on this trip. One can not",
          "Arrived as pilgrims but due to renovation no mass or botafumeiro for 2 yrs. Go early or late in day to avoid lines. Little chapel at back has services still.",
          "Once the work is finished (2021) it will be wonderful no doubt. Masses of elaborate gold everywhere. At the moment not a lot to see other than alleged tomb of St James",
          "What a wonderful construction the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia Spain is, As you walk through the main square towards the main entrance you can see the surrounding building that were build for the Pilgrims to rest and recuperate after their long pilgrimage to",
          "The majority of the Cathedral is undergoing restoration so you cannot access the nave or most of the side chapels. The altar too is enclosed in scaffolding, but you can see enough to realise the magnificent of the building and you can access both the Saint at the high altar",
          "While the cathedral is indeed magnificent in terms of size and opulence, it currently is undergoing an extensive interior renovation. Still, you get the picture. There is a terrific cathedral museum attached. There are beautiful stone carvings, statuary, tapestries, all",
          "we'd been in spain for a week and had already seen our share of cathedrals, it was rainy, and evening when we arrived. We'd driven from Plasencia, a beautiful 5h drive, so by the time we got settled we walked into SDC from our hotel and it was dark and the cathedral was closed,",
          "Fabulous historic cathedral,such magnificent architecture and just a delight to visit! A must see for all visiting!",

          "So this was visited at the end of the Camino, it's a beautiful building that has been separated into several different parts which you can go and see. It doesn't cost anything to be admitted to the main church, though donations are encouraged, and you do have to pay for the",
          "The cathedral itself is amazing! Beautiful fa\u00e7ade and rich history! Should not miss it. That said, we booked a guided tour of the Portico of Glory and cathedral museum online. The explanations in the cathedral museum are all in Spanish not English. We were advised",
          "Unfortunately the place is under total renovation - as it looks like for a long time to go - pity they didn't do it in stages and leave a few marbles free to see",
          "From the outside the cathedral is impressive. Beautifully designed and decorated, it promises an event when you enter. Unfortunately this is not the case, and it's not the enormous restoration works that cause this (works that have been ongoing apparently for ages). It's just",
          "This is a main pilgrimage site for people from all over the world \u2013 a lot of people standing outside the building came from the Camino de Santiago. The inside is beautiful and covered in gold, and there is a statue of a saint that you can go up an hug. I\u2019m not Catholic so I\u2019m",
          "A beautiful Roman Catholic cathedral with a very decorative fa\u00e7ade and interior and legend has it that is the burial home of the relics of Saint James the Great (aka the Apostle Santiago, one of the 12 apostles). The latter is the reason for it being a major pilgrimage",
          "During a business trip I tool the time to visit the cathedral. It was raining young dogs and I was complete wet, but i'm glad that I did the visit. The cathedral is very impressive and beautiful. Unfortunately main parts were under construction. But know I have an idea why so",
          "The final destination for many pilgrimage, you can visit this cathedral via car, bike, bus, or walking. Either way, you get to see an architectural wonder both inside and outside. The church is huge and the views from inside are amazing. Walking around the inside and outside,",
          "I am not talking about faith or the pilgrimage walks but we found the cathedral one of the ugliest and most uninspiring churches we\u2019ve seen. Maybe it can look better when not under renovation, but not much.",
          "This is our second Camino, and we were able to attend the pilgrims mass both times, and being lucky to witness the botafumeiro take flight. The cathedral is big and beautiful both inside and out, the craftsmanship was superb. The inside of the Cathedral will be under",

          "A must visit to the museum and cathedral. Multiple walking accesses throughout the streets of Santiago.",
          "Brilliant architecture 11th/12th century cathedral absolutely stunning from the outside. Inside smaller than I thought it would be and not as grand, but when you think when it was built it understandable. Said to be the resting place of one of the 12 apostles and it\u2019s a nice",

          "One can only imagine the awe that pilgrims on the Camino would have felt when they arrived at this cathedral. From the outside it is impressive as is the medieval square and the surrounding streets. We arrived when the nativity scenes had been constructed and the inside of the",
          "On a rainy day in December, we were just two of around 20 visitors that had made the journey to see the cathedral which meant we could take our time as explore unhindered by crowds of tourists.

          "Arriving at the Cathedral in a tour form our cruise we discover first hand the importance this place has in the Catholic World, the amount of pilgrims that walked for days to get here is amazing, you only have to see their faces when they enter the Square it\u00b4s humbling and in",
          "This is the end point for the camino. If you can get there for the midday service, i highly recommend! I have never seen a service like that! The cathedral is beautiful and always full of new people And the town is quaint and great for a day wondering arounf the streets.",

          "Besides the cathedral where you can embrace the holy James, the museum is very interesting with many exhibits from the history of the church. Besides the museum, there is an exhibition on Master Mateo, who was a medieval architect and sculptor. The old town is smaller than we",

          "an amazing building with centuries of history. you do have to abide by the rule of using no flash. Fortunate enough to witness the swinging of the inscene burner",
          "The Cathedral is actually very difficult to find on your own if driving a rental car. Streets are narrow and plenty of traffic Should be good to visit with a group bus tour The Cathedral is very pretty and famous for having the huge incense hanging in the center of the church",

          "We have traveled and seen many cathedrals. This one tops our list. Besides being breathtaking it had a very spiritual special type of feel to it. For once although filled with tourists it did not feel touristy at all. Highly recommend Santiago de Compostela",
          "We just loved this cathedral. It is huge and we came for the pilgrims mass after our walk on the Camino trail. Enjoyed being part of the mass very much.",
          "The town itself is intriguing to walk around, physically attractive, and tokens of the Camino de Santiago in all the little shops. Happy but exhausted pilgrims gather in the main square. But if you get the chance to attend a mass in the cathedral - even as a non Christian - it",
          "Many kms and then the end. A must it's \"Portico de la gloria\", the symbol of this cathedral, something ancient written in marble and stone, a great opera. I thank that in the period that i was there it was open, there is a long queue but it's worth the visit.",

          "Amazing place, stunning historical building well worth a visit. If you happen to be there when they have a mass with the thurible in full swing, its worth going. But remember it is a mass, its ok to be there as a non catholic, but treat it with respect.",
          "Santiago de Compostela Cathedral is the ending point of the 790 KM Camino de Santiago from Saint Jean Pied de Port of France. I started my pilgrimage from Saint Jean Pied de Port and 31 day camino ended at Santiago de Compostela... Lots of pilgrims were at the plaza in front of",
          "Although we had not done the Camino, we attended the Pilgrim's Mass at noon. It was a moving and uplifting experience even though we could not understand the Spanish service. The thurible was in use at the end of the service. The building itself is worth viewing especially the",
          "What an awe inspiring place this must be for those finishing their pilgrimage. The organ, the botafumeiro, the vastness of the cathedral. If you have a change to go to a mass where the botafumeiro is due to swing- make sure to stay.",
          "Lovely interior and if you are fortunate enough to see the Botafumeiro 'In full swing' it is a pleasure to behold, filling its insence into the Cathedral. Saint James (Santiago) tomb also in the Crypt. Many beautiful features. Very old a must see.",
          "This is the bittersweet ending to the pilgrimage and in peak times the amount of people can be a bit overwhelming. I was in a tour group which gave insight of the history and enabled us to sit and prepare for mass, Eva our guide, with Fresco tours made the end of our camino an",
          "This monumental church is at best to be wonder from the Plaza Obrador. The new baroque fassade is so detailed and complex and covers the former portico de la gloria (in repairs). The normal access is from the portico de las platerias which has some of the romanesque style.",
          "A pilgrimage ends ..... and you must go to the service at the Cathedral in Santiago de Compostella, whether you are there for religious, spiritual or your personal journey on the Pilgrims' Trail. Great atmosphere and a wonderful display seeing the incense burner swing so high",
          "A large solid and not particularly attractive structure. Certainly worth see but it's not a wow, take your breath away sight but the streets and courtyards that surround it are interesting. .",
          "I thought the cathedral was stunningly beautiful. Would highly recommend anyone to come and visit. The square is a great place to stop and see all the tourists gathered.",
          "We walked a section of the camino and finished in Santiago. The Cathedral and the square facing it is an absolutely stunning place. We sat there for an hour with our bags just taking it all in. As the weather was very poor upon our arrival, we never got to do the rooftop tour",
          "The Pilgrim Walk from Sarria was a challenging experience. And followed by proudly presenting my worn Pilgrim Passport to obtain a Certificate given to those who walked the distance. Lastly attending the Pilgrims' Mass in Compostela, and the experience of seeing the Botafumeiro.",
          "Beautiful city lots to do and see,beautiful churches.great restaurants Lovely parks and much more. Enjoy the street musicians also",
          "This is a massive cathedral. It was packed to full capacity around mass time. It does not have much stained glass as we later saw in Leon and Avila. It is inspiring to see all the hikers who have competed the Camino. We intend to watch The Way again..",
          "Even though we were there in October, everything about this place was jam-packed. Usually, in any other cathedral we've visited, there is somewhere quiet that you can sit, contemplate, and have a good look at a quiet pace. This was, on two visits, standing room only, and",
          "Although the facade was still under renovation when I visited, it remains an impressive piece of architecture even for those who are not religiously motivated.",
          "Beautiful and serene, but a bit chaotic with the refurbishings. We are not religious but enjoyed walking around, visiting the tomb of the Apostel, the various chapels and so on. Entrance is free but you can donate. We also took the rooftop tour (12\u20ac per person without",
          "This cathedral is huge and impressive. Add to that it\u2019s amazing significance as the end spot for pilgrimages by thousands of people from across the world and this makes it a very special place you must see. If possible attend at least part of the daily pilgrims mass at noon,",
          "This is a must see if you are in the area. It is a well preserved and cared for Cathedral with elaborate yet simple design. It is huge and you can spend a day exploring the whole complex. This is where the pilgrims journey to aongl the \"WAY\"",
          "We went to the Pilgrims' Mass here after walking the Camino. The Cathedral was packed and the service was deeply moving. The cathedral is beautiful.",
          "Magnifiient building both inside and out very tourist oriented town but interesting, plenty of places to eat with a very good selection",
          "We went to noon mass at the Cathedral. The nun singing had a beautiful voice. The only disappointment for me was not having the thurible swung with incense. The organ is magnificent.",
          "Finished 5 days of sarria-santiago walk with my best friend and reached the cathedral before noon. We are surprised how the crowd gathered in the center of the cathedral. Thousands of Pilgrims who devote their time effort and energy to do the camino. Truly a wonderful experience",
          "For Catholics around the world, a pilgrimage to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, where apostle James is buried, is in the aspirational to-do-list. We are very grateful we did it this year. The Cathedral is impressive, specially if you attend a pilgrim\u2019s Mass.",
          "The cathedral is a must see whether you walk the Camino or not. It's so beautiful. The most memorable event is the huge incense (ball?) that is swung across the cathedral at the end of mass. It's amazing! p.s. it's best to not bring a backpack - my friend was denied entry.",
          "After 165 KM walking on the Camino you come to the end-for me the most meaningful was attending the blessing in the Cathedral and visiting the tomb of St. James. Also the Mass was a total mind blower, again, this has been done since the 9th century. How many experiences does",
          "We drove from Porto Portugal almost 3 hours. it was well worth it. We met a number of pilgrims that made the journey. One man travelled 790km by himself. We saw others with bandages on their feet from the journey. You could feel the energy. The cathedral was beautiful and",
          "Beautiful cathedral, friendly staff at pilgrim office Easy access to cathedral for mass and viewing Well organised queuing system, entrance and exit well marshalled. Lots of visitors utilised this Cathedral on a daily basis.",
          "A magnificent alter and cathedral in general. Make sure to see the relics of St James. The walk around the back of the alter to @ hug the saint\u201d is worth it even if just for a totally different perspective . Go to a mass to see the incense swing \ud83d\udc4d",
          "As you walk through the old streets towards the cathedral you get odd glimpses of it , but when you emerge into the squares around it and get the full view , it is mightily impressive, even allowing for the scaffolding at the front",
          "We made quite a journey to visit and found the city uninteresting and the cathedral not as impressive as Salamanca or say York will not bother to go again.",
          "With my \u2018Compostela\u2019 certificate in hand, it is time to explore Santiago de Compostela\u2019s magnificent Old Town. Wonderfull\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1",
          "I can\u2019t say enough about visiting this beautiful cathedral. Having visited as a teenage girl I didn\u2019t get much other than the majestic beauty. This time around, soaking up the atmosphere, seeing those on their Camino pit stop, legs aching, stretching, enjoying a meal in one of",
          "The front of the cathedral is spectacular at all different times of day and the nighttime illumination is beautiful.",
          "If you've just completed your Camino, the Cathedral is a must. In fact, whether or not you are Catholic, the daily Pilgrim Mass is most worthy of your attending. Be sure to visit the crypt beneath the high altar to see the crypt containing the remains of St. James.",
          "The Pilgrim Masses are very crowded but outside those times it is much quieter. The organ was played at the shorter Mass",
          "Admittedly I was disappointed by my experience at the Cathedral. There were so many people walking around, talking, taking pictures, lined up to \"hug the statue,\" announcements with pejorative tones, a very boring sermon, and a noon pilgrim mass that, in my opinion, lacked soul",
          "Surprised it was so well kept. The cathedral overlooks the main town square. There is a hotel nearby that has a beautiful rooftop view and great coffee.",
          "A wonderful experience. The history, architecture, beauty and overall was overwhelming Exploring the buildings, walking and touching the surroundings was great. Getting to know more about St James and the monarchy was fascinating A Must See!!",
          "The highlight of my visit to Santiago de Compostela and, for that matter, of our 27-day trip was the botafumeiro, or the swinging of the urn, with the smell of incense amid the chanting of the priests in the altar. The botafumeiro doesn\u2019t happen all the time, only when there is",
          "The external and internal architecture of this cathedral were amazing. Although I found the baroque high alter very ornate for my taste. With the huge Santiago del Abrazo presiding over the main alter of the basilica. The internal organ structure was also an impressive",
          "Is a beautiful medieval/baroque church, and you should visit it even if you are not catholic. If you decide to come to Santiago, then you already know what this place stands for.",
          "Each of the facades of the Cathedral are fascinating and each is totally different. The South facade (and entrance) off the Plaza de Platerias is the most impressive. The interior has much renovation work going on, especially above the altar and the Portico de la Gloria, which",
          "Amazing piece of architecture. The details are unbelievable. Also take a look inside. The artwork is as you would expect it.",
          "This one was on my bucket list to celebrate Mass with the pilgrims from \"The Way\" The Cathedral of St James was magnificent.",
          "We haven\u2019t seen \u201cPortico...\u201d as it is still hidden, but the cathedral (free visit) is impressive; we took the chance to hug Santiago\u2019s statue :) but haven\u2019t visited the crypt. We also visited the museum of the cathedral (6 euro) and it was a good decision as we succeeded to see",
          "The cathedral dominates the skyline of Santiago. Worth a visit to the Parque Alameda to watch the sunset over the cathedral.",
          "No fee for entry but you are likely to stand in a line which moves quickly. Entry is on the side. No one enters the front of the cathedral. Inside, you can take as much time as you would like, including another line to walk behind the altar and view the crypt of St. James.",
          "The cathedral is a moving experience. For those of you who have seen the film \u201cThe Way\u201d and expected to go into the cathedral via the Glory Gates and lay your hand on the stone pillar worn away by millions of pilgrims, this is not the case. The cathedral needs to be preserved",
          "Regardless of whether or not you are Catholic, this mass is a spiritual and mystical experience. I would highly recommend it.",
          "It was amazing finishing the camino here and admiring the beautiful cathedral, watching other pilgrims arrive",
          "Beautiful cathedral worth a visit. Be aware that there is a 3 hour line up to see the portico. Many shops and restaurants surrounding cathedral are same same and costly. Go further away to get better value for money.",
          "The cathedral is awesome. I can't visit the portico due the waiting time is closed to 5 hrs. But inside the cathedral offered a lots a history. We can take pictures ( no flash). I recommend this place you can't leaves the city without view this history site.",
          "We booked the rooftop tour appreciating it would be in Spanish only but still looking forward to this as the spiritual highlight of our month\u2019s journey round northern Spain. Sadly the only time the non-Spanish speakers were addressed during the visit was when being threatened",
          "We nearly did not attend a service, but trust me, it is a must attend to end your Camino on a high. The cathedral on its own is beautiful with so much history. The service was also beautiful and will leave you with a good everlasting memory of your Camino.",
          "I do not know what I was thinking! The roof top tour sounded like such a good idea and if you have the constitution of a mountain goat (as nearly all of my fellow visitors seemed to have) then this is an incredible opportunity to get up close and personal with the Cathedral,",
          "What an amazing experience the cathedral Was full of people , amazing voices singing the pendulum being swung by the monks . Truly special event .",
          "The rooftop tour is fabulous well worth the money. Unfortunately the guide only spoke Spanish but the views from the various positions were stunning",
          "A must-see for all, especially Catholics (as it is the resting place of Apostle Saint James the Great)",
          "Fabulous building, great ambiance. The tour on the rooftops gives additional information about the different styles and periods. Unfortunately, also a major tourist attraction, which involves lines, steep prices and time slots.",
          "The Cathedral is a magnificent temple. The pilgrims who completed the Camino de Santiago rejoice in front of the Cathedral which gives it a special feeling.",
          "A visit to Santiago de Compostela is not complete without going to this cathedral. The massive cathedral dominates the square at the terminus of the Camino de Santiago so there are pilgrims everywhere. It is beautiful on the exterior and interior. The bones of St. James are",
          "I strongly recommend if you are in Santiago de Compostela. It's a wonderful cathedral, a place full of history",
          "The outside of this massive cathedral is truly awe-inspiring. Some areas are are original and some have been updated, but it is all very old. The interior is not as grand as some other cathedrals, but is notable for its size, the gold altar area and the many side chapels. Saint",
          "Simple. Everything you\u2019ve seen on tv but full of emotion.to be honest there are grander Cathedrals - Burgos being one of them but it\u2019s Home after a very long and painful walk. Don\u2019t miss it",
          "This cathedral was built to house the relics of St James the Apostle. The church is very ornate and the altar is gold or silver in appearance with a large statue of St James that pilgrims can walk up from behind the altar and give him a hug. This is the end place for pilgrims on",
          "The highlight of a day trip to Santiago de Compostela, as nothing can prepare you for the experience of seeing/hearing the soaring height of the cathedral and it's bells, all people in the square, pilgrims and tourists alike, makes you feel small and appreciate this",
          "Beautiful in everything. We were there when mass was celebrated, and the botumafeiro was swung through the cathedral. Very impressive! Nearby entirely wheelchair accessible, via the shop.",
          "I sure this will be a beautiful visage once all the scaffolding is down, but still an emotional experience after 500 miles of walking.",

          "Being the final stop on my camino I was very emotional when I visited. It is open all day until 9 pm although they restrict movement during masses. The relics of St. James are there to be seen (in a silver box) and you can go up the stairs behind the altar and hug the main",
          "Fabulous - don\u2019t miss it! This was indeed a welcome sight - at first seeing from miles away approaching Santiago on foot from the south. The cathedral appears to be an interesting blend of Romanesque, Gothic and Baroque. The nave and sanctuary were awe-inspiring. After walking",

          "The pilgrims service in the cathedral is really special and should not be missed by any pilgrims. The cathedral is lovely and is a very active place of worship. The facade is fabulous and very ornate. Even if you are not a pilgrim, it is a church worth visiting.",

I found a melting pot of emotions from all the many reasons why this city and cathedral attracts people it was so",
          "My friend and I visited the cathedral during late afternoon, there were no queues to get in and we were able to walk round at our leisure. Photography without flash is possible in most areas. We then had booked a combination tour for the following morning to visit the museum",
          "One for your heart and senses to imbibe! The outer appearance of the cathedral is, presently, a little tarnished/obscured by the renovation works scaffolding but the sense of awe remains despite this. Internally is a wow with the Portico da Gloria, the crypt (where the relics",

          "We had a quick look at the cathedral when taking a walk round the city centre sites. There was no queue to get in and entrance was free. Clearly the architecture is very impressive but we found it to be very dark and uninviting inside and overly ornate....certainly not beautiful",
          "This Cathedral is utterly magnificent. Our tour group was fortunate to attend the Pilgrim's Mass complete with the Botafumiero, the enormous incense censer which is swung back and forth at the end of Mass. Confession was available before the service in several languages",
          "I'll be very happy when the restoration work is complete and the cathedral is fully visible. Inside work will restrict access and views, but it's worth it to take the rooftop tour! Pilgrim mass gets very crowded, especially when a tour group pays for the botafumiero. There are",

          "While not the most beautiful or interesting cathedral in Europe (or even of the Camino), the sense of euphoria you get here is unparalleled. This is the endpoint of the Camino de Santiago, and it was exciting simply because we walked about 500 miles to get here. When you arrive",
          "This is by far one of the oldest and most respected destinations in the world, and as such, it commends millions every year who visit it looking for answers to their prayers. I was truely amazed by its structure. Its well worth the visit.",

          "Amazing place that is unavoidable if in Santiago. The focal point of the whole place. I'm not remotely religious but the sheer size and grandeur of the whole complex was impressive.",
          "Aside from the Vatican, this was an amazing place of worship. For travelers, there is a lot of history here and I would recommend you do your own research. Make sure you go up the main altar from the stairway in the back.",
          "I sneaked into the cathedral early evening when the queues had gone, but I was not impressed. It is full of over-ornate and ugly side chapels and, as a non-Catholic, I find the emphasis on relics of dead saints rather creepy. My advice would be, if you can't find a quiet time to",

          "We parked (campervan) on the outskirts of the city next to a coach park and took a 2euro bus ride in to this small city - the roads are narrow in the centre. The cathedral was a magnificent building - it was good to see some medieval gothic architecture in place of the deluge of",

          "When we arrived, the line to get into the cathedral was very long - it took 50 minutes. You cannot have your large backpack with you, so you might as well come back after you've checked into your hotel. It was very busy inside and only places on the floor to sit, so just be",

        "wiki": "The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao is a museum of modern and contemporary art designed by Canadian-American architect Frank Gehry, and located in Bilbao, Basque Country, Spain. The museum was inaugurated on 18 October 1997 by King Juan Carlos I of Spain, with an exhibition of 250 contemporary works of art. Built alongside the Nervion River, which runs through the city of Bilbao to the Cantabrian Sea, it is one of several museums belonging to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation and features permanent and visiting exhibits of works by Spanish and international artists. It is one of the longest museums in Spain.\nOne of the most admired works of contemporary architecture, the building has been hailed as a \"signal moment in the architectural culture\", because it represents \"one of those rare moments when critics, academics, and the general public were all completely united about something\", according to architectural critic Paul Goldberger. The museum was the building most frequently named as one of the  most important works completed since 1980 in the 2010 World Architecture Survey among architecture experts.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1991, the Basque government suggested to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation that it would fund a Guggenheim museum to be built in Bilbao's decrepit port area, once the city's main source of income. The Basque government agreed to cover the US$100 million construction cost, to create a US$50 million acquisitions fund, to pay a one-time US$20 million fee to the Guggenheim and to subsidize the museum's US$12 million annual budget. In exchange, the Foundation agreed to manage the institution, rotate parts of its permanent collection through the Bilbao museum and organize temporary exhibitions.The museum was built by Ferrovial, at a cost of US$89 million.  About 5,000 residents of Bilbao attended a preopening extravaganza outside the museum on the night preceding the official opening, featuring an outdoor light show and concerts. On 18 October 1997 the museum was opened by Juan Carlos I of Spain.\n\n\n== Building ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nThe Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation selected Frank Gehry as the architect, and its director, Thomas Krens, encouraged him to design something daring and innovative.  The curves on the exterior of the building were intended to appear random; the architect said that \"the randomness of the curves are designed to catch the light\". The interior \"is designed around a large, light-filled atrium with views of Bilbao's estuary and the surrounding hills of the Basque country\". The atrium, which Gehry nicknamed The Flower because of its shape, serves as the organizing center of the museum.When the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao opened to the public in 1997, it was immediately hailed as one of the world's most spectacular buildings in the style of Deconstructivism (although Gehry does not associate himself with that architectural movement), a masterpiece of the 20th century. Architect Philip Johnson described it as \"the greatest building of our time\", while critic Calvin Tomkins, in The New Yorker, characterized it as \"a fantastic dream ship of undulating form in a cloak of titanium,\" its brilliantly reflective panels also reminiscent of fish scales. Herbert Muschamp praised its \"mercurial brilliance\" in The New York Times Magazine.  The Independent calls the museum \"an astonishing architectural feat\".\n\nThe museum is seamlessly integrated into the urban context, unfolding its interconnecting shapes of stone, glass and titanium on a 32,500-square-meter (350,000 sq ft) site along the Nervi\u00f3n River in the ancient industrial heart of the city; while modest from street level, it is most impressive when viewed from the river. With a total 24,000 m2 (260,000 sq ft), of which 11,000 m2 (120,000 sq ft) are dedicated to exhibition space, it had more exhibition space than the three Guggenheim collections in New York and Venice combined at that time. The 11,000 m2 of exhibition space are distributed over nineteen galleries, ten of which follow a classic orthogonal plan that can be identified from the exterior by their stone finishes. The remaining nine galleries are irregularly shaped and can be identified from the outside by their swirling organic forms and titanium cladding.  The largest gallery measures 30 meters wide and 130 meters long (98 ft \u00d7 427 ft). In 2005, it housed Richard Serra's monumental installation The Matter of Time, which Robert Hughes dubbed \"courageous and sublime\".The building was constructed on time and budget, which is rare for architecture of this type. In an interview in Harvard Design Magazine, Gehry explained how he did it. First, he ensured that what he calls the \"organization of the artist\" prevailed during construction, to prevent political and business interests from interfering with the design. Second, he made sure he had a detailed and realistic cost estimate before proceeding. Third, he used computer visualizations produced by Rick Smith employing Dassault Systemes' CATIA V3 software and collaborated closely with the individual building trades to control costs during construction.\nKLM Royal Dutch Airlines donated $1,000,000 towards its construction.\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nThis museum is a colossal construction, which used more than 25,000 tons of concrete, or 10,000 cubic meters, that is why it requires deep and solid foundations. The foundation was laid on reinforced concrete piles driven into the bedrock at an average depth of 14 meters.The building is based in the clay of the bed of the nearby river \u201cRia de Bilbao\u201d; therefore, it was necessary to implant piles in large numbers, driven into the ground by many boring machines. In total, 665 pilings were driven to anchor the building to the ground.\n\n\n=== Cladding ===\nThe base of the building is covered with beige limestone from the Hu\u00e9scar quarries near Granada, cut from 5 cm thick slabs. The building is clear thanks to the walls, specially treated to protect the interior from the effects of the sun. The glass of the windows has also been treated to prevent light from damaging the exposed pieces.\nIt is clad in titanium plates, arranged in scales, on a galvanized steel structure. The Museum's exterior skin is made of 33,000 titanium plates, a material that has been used to replace copper or lead because of their toxicity. Many tests have been carried out with different materials to find one that would withstand heat and bad weather, while maintaining its character. It was during this research process that tests were started on titanium samples and the best treatment was found.\nIts lamination process is delicate and has to be done in places with high energy sources, that's why the laminated parts were made in Pittsburgh, in the United States, the rolling allowed to obtain titanium plates only 0.4mm thick, which is much thinner than if we had to use steel plates. Moreover, titanium is about half the weight of steel, indeed, the museum's titanium coating represents only 60 tons.\nDuring the conception, the pieces were designed to resist the bad weather, that is why a quilted rather than undulated shape was privileged, to resist the wind, and to avoid vibrations during storms.\nTitanium is a low-polluting material, and each part has been designed differently according to its orientation on the building, so they correspond perfectly with the curves desired by Frank Gehry.\n\n\n== Virtual Building ==\nIn the fall of 1993, architects at Gehry Partners began to utilize Dassault Systemes' CATIA software for the schematic design phase of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao to digitize and model the exterior of the Museum project. Essentially, this software calculates point by point the stresses to which materials are subjected, by generating a 3D model showing the different tensions and allowing the values of many structural elements of the museum to be calculated: the steel structure, titanium cladding or foundations, among others. It also helped to automate the cutting of materials such as stone or titanium plates.\nThe architects applied Master Modeling and Virtual Build Processes they learned from Rick Smith and his use of the same techniques on the Walt Disney Concert Hall during the previous two years. The success and global awareness of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao ushered in a new era of Virtual Building and was a catalyst for what would become popularly known as Building Information Modeling seven years later.\nPulitzer prize winning architectural critic Paul Goldberger shares the words of others that Bilbao \"could not have been constructed without CATIA\". He further relays that Bilbao \"was the first building for which CATIA played a role in almost every aspect of the design and construction process\".\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nThe museum notably houses \"large-scale, site-specific works and installations by contemporary artists\", such as Richard Serra's 100-meter-long (340 ft) Snake, and displays the work of Basque artists, \"as well as housing a selection of works\" from the Foundation's modern art collection.  In 1997, the museum opened with \"The Guggenheim Museums and the Art of This Century\", a 300-piece overview of 20th-century art from Cubism to new media art. Most pieces came from the Guggenheim's permanent collection, but the museum also acquired paintings by Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still and commissioned new works by Francesco Clemente, Anselm Kiefer, Jenny Holzer and Richard Serra.The exhibitions change often; the museum generally hosts thematic exhibitions, centered for example on Chinese or Russian art.  Traditional paintings and sculptures are a minority compared to installations and electronic forms.  The highlight of the collection, and its only permanent exhibit, is The Matter of Time (incorporating an earlier work, Snake), a series of weathering steel sculptures designed by Serra, which is housed in the 130-meter Arcelor Gallery (formerly known as the Fish Gallery but renamed in 2005 for the steel manufacturer that sponsored the project).  The collections usually highlight Avant-garde art, 20th century abstraction, and non-objective art.  When the museum announced the 2011 exhibition \"The Luminous Interval\", a show of artwork belonging to Greek businessman Dimitris Daskalopoulos, who is also a museum trustee, this met with criticism of, among other things, too much curatorial power for a serious benefactor. In 2005, Olivier Berggruen and Ingrid Pfeiffer curated a retrospective of Yves Klein.\nIn 2012 David Hockney's exhibition  drew over 290,000 visitors to the museum.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economic and media impact ==\nThe museum was opened as part of a revitalization effort for the city of Bilbao. Almost immediately after its opening, the Guggenheim Bilbao became a popular tourist attraction, drawing visitors from around the globe. In its first three years, almost 4 million tourists visited the museum, helping to generate about \u20ac500 million in economic activity. The regional council estimated that the money visitors spent on hotels, restaurants, shops and transport allowed it to collect \u20ac100 million in taxes, which more than paid for the building cost.\n\nThe building was featured in the 1999 James Bond film The World Is Not Enough in the pre-title sequence and the Tamil film Sivaji (2007), in which it is the setting for the music video of the song \"Style\", composed by A. R. Rahman.  Mariah Carey's music video \"Sweetheart\", directed by Hype Williams, shows singers Jermaine Dupri and Carey in various locations at the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nThe so-called \"Bilbao effect\" refers to how the museum transformed the city. The term, however, has also been employed by critics who have denounced the museum as a symbol of gentrification and cultural imperialism. The Wall Street Journal suggested that the Bilbao effect should be called the Bilbao anomaly, \"for the iconic chemistry between the design of building, its image and the public turns out to be rather rare.\"Art critic Brian O'Doherty was positive about approaching the building but criticized the museum's interior effect, saying \"[O]nce you get indoors things are a little different. Even the so-called site-specific works didn't look too happy to me. Most of the interior spaces are too vast.\" He went on to describe how works by Braque, Picasso and Rodchenko \"looked absurd\" and tiny on the museum's walls.\n\n\n== Management and 2007 embezzlement incident ==\nAccording to a report issued in 2007 by the Basque Court of Auditors, the museum paid more than US$27 million for the acquisition of art between 2002 and 2005, including Serra's The Matter of Time for the cavernous ground-floor gallery. After another audit in 2008 revealed that money was missing from accounts, the Foundation said that it filed a case against the director, Roberto Cearsolo Barrenetxea, \"for financial and accounting irregularities\", asserting that he had admitted diverting money from two companies that manage the Guggenheim Bilbao building and its art collection to his own account since 1998.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nWorld Architecture Survey\n12 Treasures of Spain\nGuggenheim family\nThe Globalized City, a publication doing case studies on the museum as a large scale development project\nList of Guggenheim Museums\n\n\n== References ==\n\nCuito, Aurora, Pons, Eugeni, Guggenheim, 2001.\nGuggenheim Bilbao, 2000, Connaissance des Arts (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Promotion Artistique) ; no. especial.\nSullivan, Edward J, Calvo Serraller, Francisco, Hunter, Sam, Forma eta figurazioa : Blake-Purnell bildumako maisu-lanak : [erakusketa, Guggenheim Bilbao Museoa], Museo Guggenheim Bilbao, 1998.\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nScholars on Bilbao - academic works that analyse Bilbao's urban regeneration\nGuggenheim Museum Bilbao - Project for Public Spaces Hall of Shame\nPictures of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao\nGuggenheim Museum in an artistic short movie\nBilbao.

          "This museum contains more modern art from the 21st century. Occasionally, you may see some art from an older period. Personally, I like classical art, impressionism, romanticism, cubism, neoclassical, and other art types from the Middle Ages to the revolutionary",
          "Very nice museum, not only outside but an outstanding experience inside. 4d experience, movies, sculptures, paintings (Van Gogh, Picasso, Renoir, Cesanne, Andy Warhol...)",
          "Building: 5 stars. Exhibits: 3.5. I was here about twenty years ago or so when it first opened and even though I've seen my fair share of Frank Gehry buildings since then, you never forget your first. It is such a gorgeous building. When it first opened, it seemed to be",
          "This is a big draw in Bilbao, so I should tread carefully, but I personally found that actually a lot could be seen by just going around the outside bits for free. This was echoed by others who went there, and several people said the exhibits inside were a bit too niche.",
          "This visit was really unforgettable experience. We liked every moment of the visit. Personally, I'm very sorry that we didn't have even more time. Definitely, we should come here back again.",
          "We were only really interested in the building itself and were blown away by the architecture. We spent an hour or so walking around and taking it all in - well worth the trip and worth a revisiting in a few years or so. We did buy tickets in advance for the museum but it was",

          "Amazing building with a wonderful river walk that goes along the entire river into the downtown. The art fits the building style and the gallery sizes and light.",
          "After just wrapped up the Barcelona portion of our trip and all of the Gaudi delights, we were yet again blown away by the talent of Frank Gehry and the incredible Guggenheim. The structure itself is beyond words. A visual masterpiece at every twist and turn, in every light and",
          "The Gugenheim is a big museum where you can easely bring a day of strolling around without having seen everything. We went in on a rainy day. To bad they don\u2019t have enough room to store wet coats. That is a missed opportunity.",
          "Suprisingly good. Enjoyed the variety offered by the museum. Is listed in the top 500 places to visit by Lonely Planet. Note closed on Mondays.",

          "More than I expected, one of the great attractions of Bilbao and Now I want to See other Guggenheim museums!",
          "Enjoyed my trip to the Guggenheim in Bilbao. This is easily somewhere you can explore alone at your own pace or together with friends. Be sure to pick up a map of the 3 floors as to not miss the smaller exhibits.",
          "The Guggenheim caught my fancy after reading about it in Dan Brown\u2019s The Origin. The museum was everything we expected and more. Frank Gehry\u2019s architecture and design is mind blowing and the art outside from well known artists were unique. Inside the museum were very interesting",
          "Perhaps the best thing about the Guggenheim is the building itself. It is stunning in a nondescript kind of way. The large sculptures around the outside and the VAST Richard Serra sculpture on the ground floor are the highlights. Other than a few impressionist paintings the rest",
          "The museum building is an attraction in its own right, There are a number of galleries set over a few floors each one completlly different from the next. There is anaudio guide to explain the main exhibits and dont miss the art outside like the puppy and spider. The best views",
          "The Guggenheim Bilbao is a name of itself. Well known and respected. And it boasts a daring architecture that is world renowned. All that however is not reflected in its collection. Admitted, it largely depends on the temporary exhibitions, but since they take up a large area of",

          "We stoped here for a quick visit before driving to San Sebasti\u00e1n. It is a fun building to look at, and the artwork surrounding the building is equally fun to se. The huge spider is truly enormous. Great to get a picture with people under it so you se the size. If you are in the",
          "It is worth visiting just to see the amazing building and interior architecture. The exhibits weren't that exciting, but just walking around the building was such a pleasure. One also has to walk around the outside to see the pieces out there. Plus, you should walk along the",

          "Amazing inside and outside. Delightful huge Jeff Koons puppy, covered with flowers, greets you at the entrance. Huge gallery spaces allow monumental masterpieces to breathe (our favorite 2 pieces were Anselm Kiefer's). The only negative is that you are not allowed to",
          "We went to Bilbao mainly to visit Guggenheim Museum. We are glad that we saw it. It is extraordinary from in- and outside. Being inside the museum you\u2019ll be surprised how big it is. They had great exhibitions, one visiting and the permanent ones.",
          "Awful awful art, packed with people pretending the art was wonderful so they wont't feel like fools. There was only one truly interesting work on display. The museum felt like an overflow for the parent museum",

          "The outside of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao is astonishing with unique architecture! Inside having walked through the three stories and various exhibition areas I was a bit disappointed. It is a famous museum and surely it could present more, perhaps visiting presentations.",
          "The inside is pretentious and boring. 2 hours of my life that I won\u2019t get back. Outside however, Puppy, Maman, Fog, Tulips and of course the architecture of the building are amazing.",
          "Was very disappointed in the Guggenheim. Was expecting world-class exhibits as well as world-class amenities and above-average assistance. None were the case. There are many museums in the world whose collections of this type far surpass the Guggenheim and whose staff show",
          "If you are in the area then a visit to see the museum is a must just for the architecture alone.The price is very reasonable and includes an audio guide. I wasn't overly impressed with some of the art exhibits, but art is subjective, isn't it. Regardless, an enjoyable day.",

          "The building is great but it is not an art gallery. There wasn\u2019t a single thing in there ( possibly the Rothko) that I found beautiful or inspiring. Go to Belles Artes",
          "I really love my visit here not for the art work but for the building and the exterior sculptures. The building captures attention from all angles. On a cloudy day, the metal takes on a silvery hue while on a sunny day, it gleams golden. The giant puppy made of fresh flowers",
          "The building is beautiful, is a master piece, inside is as beautiful as it is on the outside. Modern art is complex however when I read more about the artist and the work that is showing you will understand better, the puppy was in the grooming when I came, so I will need to",

I have read a lot of negative comments about the art and how \u201ca child could do it\u201d but the point is a child didn\u2019t. Did I like every work? No, but I don\u2019t like every work in the",
          "Had a free day and went to the museum. The entrance fee was reduced as they had the second floor closed for new exhibitions. Worth walking around outside as well as inside. There are elevators, escalators or stairs.",
          "If there was a six star category for unique places in the world, this would in that category easily. We took the bus in and as we crossed the river we got goosebumps. We walked the entire building before going in, snapped a lot of photos and gasped in wonder. You might think I",
          "My wife and I visited the famous museum. Neither of us are really into modern art, so not fair to rank it, but loved the building and exterior. It is a marvel and impressive. We took photos inside and out, and from distances like the nearby bridge and on the top of the city",
          "Great building. Great attractions outside around the building. Pleasant surrounding by river. Nice area. Lovely cafe outside too",
          "The building is as amazing up close as it looks in all the photos. Inside, depending on your taste, the art lacked something. There were a couple of good temporary exhibitions when we were there but the sign-posting was dreadful which made it difficult to know what was where.",
          "Hard to miss and clearly a world class piece of architecture, this was my main reason for coming to Bilbao at all. The architecture is stunning, mind blowing, gorgeous. However, I thought the building does better from the outside than inside. I was disappointed that the museum",
          "Of course the outside is stunning. But don't go just to admire the building, sculptures, and Puppy. Inside is a very nice array of modern art. That is a manageable amount to see in about 2-3 hours. Be sure to pick up an audio guide which is free with admission (ask for it when",
          "Its Well worth a visit, although 2nd floor was closed i think. The smoke along the river was cool. The light shows are very good also. The spider is really cool outside too",
          "The building itself is the most beautiful piece of the collection. There are a number a attractive pieces in and around the museum, but I found the collection limited.",
          "This is a great piece of architecture and if in Bilbao you should visit. The best part is the outside but it is worth paying the 17 euro entrance fee if only to see the inside and stand on the terrace. The Art is not to everyones taste, certainly not ours as much of it is very",
          "Fantastic building. Really impressive. Steep entrance price which is not worth it for the quality of modern art on display. Tate Modern or the Saachi collection have far superior modern art for no entrance fee.",
          "The museum is absolutely grand, beautiful and work observing. However, once inside, you will be left with a bit of \"meh.\" Nothing great to see inside, just glance and shoot photos from outside then continue your stroll.",
          "Really impressive building with beautiful walkways. Inside very modern, but uncomfortably warm. Worth a visit I suppose, but just not for me.",
          "Loved visiting this iconic building and seeing some great modern art. The visiting exhibitions weren\u2019t amazing but I loved the permanent ones. The cafe was also surprisingly good and cheap for a museum. The art outside is great but it was also worth going inside. Unfortunately",
          "When in Bilbao , it\u2019s a must place to visit , the rating will depend on ones perception of modern art . To me , it was very much like Tate Modern , full of \u201c so called art \u201c , many of the pieces looked similar to what a nursery school child would produce . The one room was",
          "This is a must-see in Bilbao. That said, the building almost overwhelms the art, and the collection is actually quite small.",
          "Not my thing to be honest but the building is amazing and some of the exhibitions are interesting so well worth visiting.",
          "I was not aware that Level 2 was closed, which served to significantly limit the collection on display. This was disappointing. Perhaps a drop in price to reflect a reduction in gallery space open to the public .",
          "The exterior of the building and the outside exhibits were excellent. For me personally I found the interior and permanent exibits a little disappointing. It was all very samey with little variation in the permanent exhibits. Glad I have been but have no desire to return",
          "We were excited to come to Bilboa just to see this gallery. The architecture didn't disappoint, but most of the art inside was a waste of time for us.",
          "If you like the bizarre, you will like it here. Some stuff that everyone might like, but mostly for the connoisseurs and fancy folk.",
          "I gave it 5 stars for the building, it is magnificent to behold. For us from Southern California, and particularly within an 30 mile radius of Los Angeles. We have Walt Disney Hall. Very similar in style. But so different in purpose. We subscribe to the LA Philharmonic, and",
          "l really don't know what others were looking at here who rated it, but basically the entire collection is a bizarre collection of trash from other galleries. We've been to countless major public and private collections/galleries across the world over the years and this place was",

          "Well, I have a creative side and I quite enjoyed this....80%. U gotta come when in Bilboa or you just miss out. We just turned up,10am and paid on the door. Free to leave bags and coats and you get audio which tells you the stuff the artist has worked at to produce what your",
          "The statues and the outside are absolutely stunning, the exhibits inside are fascinating. Cafeteria food is also excellent",
          "Spectacular building, housing a collection that\u2019s too avante garde for my taste. Richard Serra\u2019s monumental steel \u201cMatter of Time\u201d is awesome, and we enjoyed seeing the well-known pieces around the perimeter, such as Jeff Koons\u2019s huge \u201cPuppy\u201d covered in flowers, and Louise",
          "We really planned a stop in Bilbao only f\u00f6r this famous, gorgious museum. It is wonderful. Fantastic architecture (how is it possible to even dream of something similar?) beautyful and surprising collections! Do not forget to taste the Cafe's unforgettable pintxos (like tapas in",
          "Highlight is the building itself - Gehry at his magical best, watch how the external walls meld into the interior. The dThe rest of the collection is not to sneeze at either. Don't miss this museum, but I don't think anyone who comes to Bilbao does.",
          "The building is the main event with the titanium skin Only 10 euro entry Lovely riverside area out back Art wasn\u2019t great it thAt much Second floor closed It\u2019s for stuff on loan Well worth seeing",
          "The complex of the museum from outside and inside is absolutely astonishing and is a crown jewel of Bilbao. That\u2019s why you will feel pain and disappointment with exhibits and art selection. Look for an architectural beauty and do not waist your time with \u201cpseudo art\u201d.",
          "One of the best museums in the world! I could have spent the whole day there. So many interesting artists! Do not forget to go outside as well, plenty to see there too. Take your time and go around the building itself if you think it costs too much. But the fee is absolutely",
          "At \u20ac10 per adult I was pleasantly surprised at this place. I\u2019m not a huge art fan but the gallery is varied and the audio guide keeps things interesting. The building itself is a marvel, and the outdoor elements such as the massive spider, the tulips and fog are interesting. We",
          "Beautiful building, art work is unique. They change some of the displays on a 4 month cycle. Really a must stop for this town.",
          "The Guggenheim is the crown jewel of Bilbao. If you only see one place while here, then this extroidinary art museum is it. The building is as much of an exhibit as the artwork within.",
          "We've been before and will go again... This Frank Gehry creation is simply breathtaking in its imagination and staggering beauty. It must have been both an inspiration and a nightmare for the engineers that had to build and realise this piece of sheer genius. If you go, you must",
          "Loved everything about our visit here. It\u2019s clear the museum was designed with the visitor experience in mind. Indoors and out - a must do when you visit Spain.",
          "Visited this museum as I had a bit of time at hand. To be honest I am not a big lover of modern art. So went in with low expectations. But was blown away by a couple of art exhibits. Would strongly recommend to visit when you are in bilbao. Wouldn't miss it.",
          "The building which can be seen from quite a distance away is most impressive and inviting. The sculptures of the spider outside and the different colour flowers are wonderful and wets your appetite for what awaits inside. However, once inside things go downhill. There are",
          "The location is very cool, in a super clean Bilbao at the river front. The outside and inside structure is amazing and super cool. When you get to the art, there is some interesting stuff, such as the wikileaks inspired art, but overall i wasn't impressed by it.",
          "Visiting the Guggenheim was our main reason for going to Bilbao. We booked tickets on-line in advance to ensure we did not have to queue, although it seemed that access was not a problem (mid-afternoon, early Sept.). We were expecting the building to be striking - but it was",
          "Location, location, location and amazing Architecture combined with a very relaxing outdoor plaza for drinks and pinxtos. I found the art in particular to be less than inspiring",
          "Not a great fan of contemporary art. Came mainly to see the building itself which is iconic and didn\u2019t disappoint. The outside exhibits were a bonus. I arrived as it opened and so only short queue even though I didn\u2019t have an advance ticket. You get a free audio unit which",
          "This is an impressive looking building, worth a visit if only to view it from the outside. Access is from the road side, not the river side, with lots of stairs to get to the entrance if you approach from the river. There are some good exhibits, particularly the heavy metal",
          "I liked absolutely everything in this museum.The avant-garde paintings,the interactive events but a monument to the ARTS it\u2019s the building per se!!!Dont miss it !!!",
          "Not too fond of modern arts but did find a few things we liked. Just to see the structure is worth the price.",
          "Our highly anticipated visit turned out to be a great disappointment. Albeit modern art museums are a different animal, this was a big disappointment. The building is magnificent and a drive by would suffice. If you are a fan of architecture you may have a different opinion but",
          "The joy of this museum is the building and surrounds and not the artwork. That seems to detract from the internal architecture. Go for a walk around and take it in from many angles, including the nearby traffic bridge",
          "Great experience. Excellent all round. Spend time at it though. Not expensive either. Highly recommend",
          "The ticket is too overpriced and the art pieces inside are too boring. You\u2019ll be able to cover the entire museum in an hour though I took 5 hours to go over everything. Just see from outside.",
          "Well worth a visit - get there early to avoid queues. The building itself is stunning - it's worth just walking around the outside.",
          "I was looking forward to this part of the trip for a long time. The museum did not disappoint. The architecture was amazing. And the art was a close second. we were lucky it was a gorgeous day.Well worth allocating a half day. Spend the rest of the day in the old town.",
          "This museum is for those who like modern art. For me it was okay. The price for adults is very expensive. You do get free audio so you can listen to a more detailed description of the arts. The biggest plus is the dog flower statue in the front. The architecture of the museum",
          "Even if you\u2019re not a fan of the truly amazing art housed at the Guggenheim Museum - Bilbao (both temporary and permanent installations), everyone should experience the museum itself. The architecture, it\u2019s materials, and the \u201cspace\u201d is worth the price of admission. There is no",
          "It's an interesting building We probably didn't spend enough time exploring the building itself as we were busy touring the city. So much to see along the river, It really is a highlight of their river scene and if you're into modern art you can also pay to go into the",

          "I'm not a typical museum type of guy, but I really enjoyed my visit to the Guggenheim museum in Bilbao. the architecture is breathtakingly beautiful. On the outside, you can already see that this is something very special. Once you are in the atrium you get deep respect for the",
          "This is a really unique and exciting building but the contents were rather exotic modern art which generally did not meet my personal tastes. There wer a few items that were well created and displayed, e.g. the beautiful shiny large and colourful tulips placed near well located",
          "A very strange building with very strange exhibits! Too expensive, they should have paid me to enter.",
          "Wonderful: worth traveling around the world to see. Don't bother reading the four star reviews, if you can't appreciate it in all it's splendor it's not for you. Juxtaposed to the old architecture of the township and along the river: it's stunning.",
          "Visited the museum but unless you are a huge modern art fan, the building and its architecture is what\u2019s interesting. The audio guide is free because it goes on and on about the artists\u2019 vision but says little. Being from Los Angeles, I had a feeling I\u2019d see similarities to",
          "My third visit in almost 20 years and yes, I agree, it's the building that is the best part. But there is some interesting art inside, just don't expect the Louvre. There were some fascinating iron sculptures on the ground floor that are a mathematical wonder if you stop to",
          "There a very few iconic buildings in the world but this is one of them. Absolutely stunning from every angle. Wonderful",
          "This has to be one of the finest ultra modern buildings in Europe. The design is awe inspiring with the titanium outer skin like fish scales gleaming in the sun. Everywhere you look inside and outside the building there is a quirky design to catch the eye and your camera. I also",
          "After arriving there, we were told that the 2nd floor was closed because an installation was underway for a new exhibit. The cost was reduced to \u20ac10, but we were very underwhelmed by the insides of this work of art. I might even say that it would be ok to not even enter the",
          "It\u2019s definitely one of the most popular tourism attraction objects in Bilbao. We enjoyed the architecture over some art installations.",
          "The Guggenheim Museum is a piece of art, an architectural monument but as a museum it is relatively poor. Just the Richard Serra installation is really amazing. Why? Well the museum is a sculpture with lots of curves, windows etc. but all of that is not at all wanted in a",
          "The best thing of this museum is the outside. If you do spend ya 13 Euro to go in the next best thing U will c is the exit sign on the way out.",
          "The Guggenheim is a sight to behold. Take the time to walk around the building to marvel at it, as well as the surrounding sculptures. The exhibits inside are interesting as well, and at the time of our visit the top floor was occupied by Picasso's works. The audio guide",
          "Wonderful way to spend a couple of hours walking around viewing the exhibits and the building itself.",
          "One of the reasons we left for Bilbao was the Guggenheim, as I reckon quite a few others do. An it was really the museum's architecture itself that made it worth while, both on the inside and the outside. To be honest, the art inside is just bits and pieces of paintings, the",
          "No matter what I think about the collection off art, the building itself is already magnificent. Outsite and inside the walls, construction, shapes and light is playing with every angle and time. It's art wrapped in art. The collection itself isnt that big but they have some",
          "We visited the museum on a rainy day. The exhibits were great but for me it was all about the building itself. Highly recommend",
          "Fantastic building - really enjoyed ground floor exhibitions - metal sculpture and LED display Second floor temporary exhibition space was closed but third floor had good selection of art",
          "The building was more beautiful than I had been led to believe and contained many wonderful works of art",
          "We loved this museum. It is such an Ultimate designers vision! The shape of the building, the materials used; the unexpected views and look outs on every Floor via balcony\u2019s, windows in- and outside.... and of course we also loved the exhibitions (although they were just",

          "just awesome \ud83e\udd70 it loooks like it is, just astonishing...the staff of the bistro is nice an friendly :)",
          "The architecture of the Guggenheim Museum is a true masterpiece, but wait there are many more masterpieces inside. All fabulous and beautifully presented.",
          "I would definitely suggest if you visit Bilbao to attend this museum. Centered on three floors, it\u2019s very spacious and has some awesome works to look at. Be advised that you cannot take pictures inside of the museum.",
          "Very surprised at the entry cost. As seniors it cost us \u20ac12.60 total for entry. The internal structure is just as impressive as the exterior. The mix of exhibits provide for everyone's taste. Although the Richard Serra \"Matter of Time\" I found the most impressive even though at",
          "This is nearly a case of the building overpowering the artwork inside. The art, the main reason of going there, is stunning. But the admittance price is worth it just for the building alone. Breathtaking, striking, your eyes just wander everywhere. Simply amazing!!",
          "Beautiful! The architecture is breathtaking an the Serra exhibit kept us enthralled for hours. Snacks at the bar were also good and the outdoor seating made the day special.",
          "even if your not into art the museum is outstanding - one of a kind inside. Worth booking online first to save some time queing.",
          "Small museum with interesting exhibitions. I just don\u2019t understand why visitors are not allowed to take pictures. There are much nicer and bigger museums around the world such as the Louvre in Paris and the Metropolitan Museum in New York where visitors are allowed to take",
          "The building is amazing but was expecting more in terms of content. What they had was great, with some good Picasso\u2019s, Van goths and the odd Monet but was expecting more",
          "A beautiful & interesting place. Bilbao is now a clean beautiful city with man places of interest. Wonderful shopping also",
          "We rearranged our trip to Bilbao to make sure to visit the Guggenheim Museum. Not only was it spectacular from the outside, but the inside architecture was just stunning. The exhibits were great as well. Definitely glad we made the time for the visit. We were lucky enough to",
          "One of the main reasons for visiting Bilbao, what an amazing building in the centre of the city. A great selection of exhibits to see. The audio tour was easy to use and interesting arts to see. Great building inside and out! Well worth a visit!",
          "It's an obvious thing to say but in Bilbao this is a must see place. Spectacular both outside and in, and something for everyone. Personally I loved the Richard Serra exhibition and found some of the modern \"paintings\" on the top floor amusingly bad, but there will be",
          "This is a museum that you shall not miss. Nice to walk both around on around the museum (outside) and inside.",
          "Even if your not an art addict, a visit is worth ... the architecture from inside is as spectacular as from the outside",
          "The building is fantastic and worth visiting for the architecture alone. The outside installations are interesting and there is plenty of stimulating modern art to see inside (of course!). Entry price was fairly reasonable, I thought : \u20ac16 for an adult, \u20ac9 for a senior (over",
          "At the margin of Bilbao s river, one can find this impressive building. Inside it is possible to watch painting and sculpture exhibitions but anyway outside some outstanding exhibitions, probably the best is the building itself.",

          "What a spectacular place. We visited it on Sunday, bought our tickets online so no queue, straight to audio guide. The building on itself is a wonderful experience. You need to go into the labyrinth! We were lucky enough to see \u201cfrom Van Gogh to Picasso\u201d and \u201cAlberto",
          "The place is always amazing and the current exhibitions (\"Giacometti\" and \"From Van Gogh to Picasso\") are outstanding",

          "Have wanted to see the Guggenheim here in Bilbao for many years and finally made it. Bought tickets ahead of time, which I think would be mandatory during busy times. The ticket gives you a specific time to visit. The building itself is a work of art by Frank Gehry, a Canadian",
          "We traveled to Bilbao just to see this museum. It certainly lived up to our expectations. It is not a huge museum, but it is arranged so beautifully. The architecture of the building is unlike anything have ever seen. Worth the trip! Don\u2019t miss this museum - it is one of the",

          "Seeing is believing and no trip to Bilbao is complete these days without a visit to the Guggenheim and Puppy. In our case, on this trip we only just got into the lobby - but spent an hour walking aropund the exterior and admiring it all. Definately have to come back for longer",
          "This was on my bucket list and I am so glad I came. Not sure I understood all conceptional art but it does provoke thought. NOT to be missed.",
          "Never tired of looking at this building in every conceivable light. From the height of the red bridge and from underneath the giant spider, every view has a completely different perspective. Quite simply one of the most stunning buildings I've ever seen.",
          "The Guggenheim is a worthwhile place to spend a day in Bilbao. The space occupied by the museum is full of interesting and some interactive art. The exterior is also full of art and the building itself worthy of time spent looking at it from all sides. The cost of the museum is",
          "Actually I was waiting for mores exhibitions, I just saw 1 and the typical that they have based in the museum. I think that maybe they can use the amazing structure and place that they have to do more things related to art",
          "Enjoying art in a work of art. Frank Gehry's mesmerising building is the perfect setting for thought-provoking modern art and masterpieces from Spain's Picasso to Van Gogh. There were excellent temporary exhibitions on but even if all that was on display was a packed of crisps",
          "If the architecture isn\u2019t enough to attract you, the art inside should. Absolutely gorgeous museum, I traveled to Spain just to see this.",
          "The architecture alone of the building and surrounding area is worth a visit yet the permanent internal steel exhibit is beyond comprehension. Must not miss this outstanding museum.",
          "Bilbao would not be Bilbao without the Gugenheim. We visited for a day on the way to San Sebastian and did not regret a moment of that decision. The old city was our starter and La Vina Pintxos our desert but the main course was definitely The Gugenheim; stunning in photos and",
          "This is a gem of Bilbao and definitely warrants a 2-3 hour stay. There was no need to pre-book as you have to with so many other global museums and audio guides are included in the price of the ticket. Well worth a visit.",
          "The Guggenheim Bilbao is a work of art that houses works of art. The Frank Gehry designed building is actually a work of sculpture. I especially like the titanium sheets which remind me of scales on a fish. Inside are some of the most memorable pieces of modern art. On this",
          "The building is quite the eye catcher. Unfortunately i was not really taken with the exhibits. Truly though, i\u2019m not really a lover of modern art, and tagged along with my husband as the weather was cold. Some fun interactive items, but i felt underwhelmed by the whole",
          "I have wanted to visit for years. Building is impressive, permanent collection is interesting but overall the museum is smaller than i thought it would be.",
          "We're not great fans of modern art, but felt we ought to have a proper taste and where better to do that than here. We spent some time exploring outside, it looks like the Sydney Opera House on L.S.D. Inside it is just as amazing, Personally I enjoyed the building itself",
          "A lot of people said how great this place is, so we went in Jan 2019. Paid 16 Euro to see the exhibits on three floors. Visited the cafe. The exhibits were a bit let down. It was not bad, but this museum is no comparison to other great museums in other European cities. I",
          "This is a fantastic museum! You need to check it while in Bilbao. All the permanent collections and installations are impressive. If you are a fan of modern art, make this visit a priority!",
          "It was my first visit to the Guggenheim Museum of Bilbao. It was incredible. Every part has its own architectural details. several galleries with different subjects were not boring. I love that building the best. I've had taken several photos and videos from that. And I've spent",
          "Even if you are not into contemporary art, it is worth going to see it. The building itself is a work of art by famous architect Frank Gehry. A delight even if you don\u2019t go in and just walk all the way around the Museum and enjoy the sculptures and interactive art pieces. Great",
          "The Guggenheim museum is so inspiring. Recommendable to 100%. We were lucky to see the Alberto Giacometti retrospective but would return again at an other occasion as it is well organised and also outside worth a visit.",
          "This building is STUNNING! If you love architecture, going and seeing the building alone will be plenty excitement. It is even more amazing on the interior, it showcases large scale art so well, you can really appreciate the art in that space. I loved this place so much I bought",
          "Even if you\u2019re not into \u2018art\u2019 in the typical sense, this building is awe inspiring in its own right. Very much worth a visit and a superb subject if you\u2019re into doing some architectural photography. Inside there is an exhibition covering the drawings and plans of the",
          "From the inside & the outside, the Guggenheim Musuem is fantastic. The walk outside offers you a view on great art pieces and the building. Inside, the Richard Serra masterpiece is stunning, others are great too. A must see for any art lover.",
          "An amazing building both inside and out with 3 floors of unusual exhibits. The matter of time by Richard Serra; sculptures and paintings by Alberto Giacometti plus some other masterpieces from Van Gogh and museum collections. It would take at least 3 hours to view most of",
          "You can't get a bad angle of this museum. It is beautiful no matter where you look. Amazing and obscure collection. Didn't care too much for the sexist sculpture artist they had who's name I didn't bother noting (I think a temp exhibition). The best part is you are not",
          "What a stunning building. It really is a must see, and the exhibitions it contains are well put together, but the temporary ones do vary so check what is on at the time of your visit. The collections are small, but powerful (especially the Thannhaiser bequest). If you like",
          "This museum is a jewel! every hour of the day, the sun plays with the titanium plates , and from dawn till sunset and even later at night, the building look a different way than the hour before!!! At the blue hour, 15 minutes after sunset, it's total magic!!!! I love this",
          "We visited on a Sunday afternoon and found no queues. Staff were very helpful. Coat and bag check was free and the audio guide was also included in the price. The museum is vast and boy did my feet hurt from walking. The exhibits are huge too from the fabulous Jeff koons Puppy",
          "I enjoyed the building and sculptural art outside even more than the art collection. It is breathtaking. Consider crossing the river to see it from that side.",
          "Walking around this amazing structure is really something rather brilliant. The way the light dances across every inch is so fascinating. If you're a photographer you'll want to shoot this beauty!",
          "This is a unique building and the contents are superb too. Make sure you remember to walk around the building and immerse yourself in the Koons and Kapoor sculptures.",
          "Yes, the building is unique and thus worth visiting during low season (e.g. January) when there are no bus loads of fellow tourists swarming around. It was a real pleasure to stroll through almost empty galleries and spaces, enjoying the spectacular architecture and some nice",
          "Our third time visiting and have never been disappointed, always something to stimulate your mind whilst having some favourites from earlier visits.",
          "We're either art snobs or just don't get art, but it didn't do it for us. We took the shuttle bus from the cruise port, easy peasy. The outside sculptures contributed to the 2 star rating. Loved these. Puppy was the best! Momma was a bit creepy as intended. Once you get inside",
          "Has to be one of the most iconic buildings in the world but the highlight is the 'Puppy', the very big flower sculpture at the front, superb and some tho0ught provoking exhibits and art too.",
          "A stunning building by Gehry... worth the visit inside and outside. Take time, walk around the building to look at the structure, the sculptures outside... and wait for some show ( the frog...;) and lightings )",
          "The Guggenheim is a fantastic building and I highly recommend spending some time walking around the outside of the entire building. Even though I was underwhelmed by a majority of the exhibitions inside the Guggenheim I would still recommend going inside. They have a fantastic",
          "Modern museum with modern and huge arts and sculptures. The famous artists paints has shown there too.",
          "No doubt you've seen many photos of this beautifully Frank Gehry designed building. I have some more to add to the Trip Advisor collection. When we were there just this past late September, we had the privilege of taking a private tour from the outside and inside. You must",
          "Even if you aren\u2019t the biggest fan of art, just don\u2019t miss the visit to Guggenheim museum in Bilbao. Great building with amazing space and art. To top it off a coffee in museums bar&bistro on the terrace enjoying the sun. Great time...",
          "The Guggenheim Museum is the principal point of interest in Bilbao. And its building represents a sight itself being a significant architectural work constructed in the end of the 20th century. The museum houses its exhibitions on three floors; it doesn't have the scale of the",
          "Worth the time to see this amazing architectural building from inside! Plus all the permanent and non expositions.",
          "Travelled to Bilbao especially to see the Guggenheim Museum and what a whow the architecture is - it gleams in the sunshine and is surrounded by amazing sculptures like \"Maman\" and Koons \"puppy\". I was lucky there were two really stunning exhibitions on too and I spent some",
          "This museum is a must see while in Bilbao. It creates the visual image of a ship from the outside with a beautiful reflecting pool and sculptures which are all part of the experience. On the other side of the building is a giant dog made from live plants and flowers. As a",
          "What a wonderful building! Loved every inch of it. Do not miss Fujiko Nakaya \u201cF.O.G\u201d sculpture. Just sit and relax, enjoying the beautiful fog embracing the outside environment. And for the kids, there is a quizz for them to make the visit more fun.",
          "Splendid museum worth seeing for its architecture as well as the exhibits inside. Get there early as queues build up quickly. Cafe does an excellent breakfast for 8 euros",
          "From the outside, this magnificent building captures your eye and lures you in. The architecture of this museum is unbelievable, with great features outside. The entrance fee is \u20ac16 but a fast moving queue. With such a large museum, who gets hundreds of thousands of guests a",
          "Its architecture is now famous the world over. A daring project at its inception that now draws crowds from all over. Well managed with excellent exhibitions, if you\u2019re in the area you can\u2019t not go. If you return, there\u2019s something new to see ...",
          "An architectural masterpiece from outside and inside with great art pieces. Great place to be creatively inspired. Personally appreciated it more than Guggenheim in New York.",
          "I can finally tick this magnificent museum off my bucket list. I was surprised to realise the museum, designed by Canadian architect Frank Gehry, was about to celebrate it\u2019s 20th anniversary. This titanium clad building literally shines in the sunshine. There are changing",
          "This gallery was the reason for my Bilbao trip and I was not disappointed. It was amazing and the building is worth seeing alone inside and outside. The collection of art is stunning international current and themed. Go!",
          "Takes only 3-4 hours to complete the whole building, unless you read every single description for every display. Enjoyed the large interactive art.",
          "I really like modern art. Let em start there. That said,a bunch of old telephones strung together is not art. A macaroni necklace is more art than that. There are not a lot of exhibits inside the museum and some of the paintings look like that canvas I had in the garage that I",
          "Visited this monumental work of art and architecture. Two words. Architecture effects. Not just affects. Family and child friendly.",
          "The collection is smaller than I expected, but has some gems. It's worth the admission just to see the building from the inside.",
          "We have passed through Bilb\u00e3o on many occasions, but never managed to get here before. It's great. Fabulous building, and an eclectic mix of modern art. I did not like all of it, but some pieces moved me to tears. So, make up your own mind, but don't miss it!",
          "If you are in Bilbao you must visit this fantastic museum. Even if you aren\u2019t into art the building is a must see from inside and out. This place reminds me a bit of the Tate galleries where you can walk in and around some of the pieces. Make sure you see the spider and time",
          "As an artist I really enjoyed being able to see in person works that I was only able to study in books. Works by Rothko, Anselm Keifer, and the whimsical \"Puppy\" sculpture by Jeff Koons to name a few. Amazing and worth a visit.",
          "Better than anticipated. Fabulous architecture and the inside contents better than we had been led to believe - perhaps we were lucky to catch a Giacometti exhibition. Jeff Coons tulips make a splash and the atmospheric fog that appears around the outside of the building every",
          "The Museum is beautiful....the building itself. The bulk of the contents are either strange, crap posing as art, or a mixture of both. Thankfully there was a temporary exhibition of Impressionist art like Van Gogh, Picasso, Degas, Renoir, etc. Those were of course excellent.",
          "Some amazing pieces especially on the ground. The maze of large Iron sculptures was staggering. Cafe also a much needed place to rest feet and feed!",
          "Guggenheim Museum is, probably, the most important building in Bilbao, a city located in the north part of the Iberian Peninsula. This buildins is very modern and here there are one of the bests and well-known museums of Contemporanean Art, in Spain. It is the most important",
          "If you are visiting Bilbao you would be mad not to go. Studying the outside can keep you busy fro an hour or so and inside there are lots of very interesting installations. Some are interactive and some are just immense.",
          "The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao is located on the river in Bilbao. It is an extraordinary building and is a work of art unto itself - in fact, the building outdoes the art. The sculptures outside are great, especially the Louise Bourgeois Spider and the bridge far above. The",

          "Great museum, nicely located by the Nervion River. Outstanding modern architecture and nice collections of paintngs by Picasso, Monet, Van Gogh and other great artists. Don't miss it when in Bilbao. I stronglt recommend it!",
          "Before coming here, I wasn't a big fan of Modern Art. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love architecture, and Frank Gehry is one of my all-time favourites. I just didn't get abstract art and the idea behind it. Now that I've seen some of it up close, and had an excellent",
          "Great great great Amazing building and collection. Allow time to see this incredible site inside and outside",
          "Speechless and overwhelmed. I love the place. One of a kind. I was a bit lost, at first. First it\u2019s a bit difficult to find your way in this Museum. But once you have made it...",

          "I am not a fan of modern contemporary art ,but I was curious to see the masterpiece of deconstructivism of Frank Gehry . In my opinion the building in itself is the star of the city , mind -boggling array of curves ,it seemed to me like a flower or maybe a strange ship .The",
          "Amazing museum. From the time you get there. The art begins before you enter the building. Give it enough time to take everything in.",
          "If anywhere in this region how can you not visit the Guggenheim museum. It is a must!! The Koons flower dog is quite the presence",
          "Very interesting building with lots of shapes & curves. The art galleries in the building were a lot smaller than I expected compared to the Tate London on St Ives for instance there is no comparison. All the major works are on the top floor. A couple of hours is ample to",
          "Brilliant inside and out.When we visited it was quite quiet so we enjoyed wandering around and taking in all there is to see,which is loads",
          "but the Guggenheim itself is the star. Awe inspiring! I would like to be given the job of organising the staff on the coat check desk but otherwise it was a wonderful visit.",
          "This museum can take all day. With its cures and surprises at every corner. Make sure you spend time outside to wonder at the building itself.",
          "What more can one say but don\u2019t miss this !! This is truly a great museum and the art exhibits and permanent collections are stunning.",
          "Amazing museum with great and very interesting collections. I wish it was bigger so I could spend more time there ! Might be a bit expensive but still totally worth it !",
          "The building is beautiful, no doubt about that. In my opinion, it\u2019s not an absolute must to visit the museum - extremely crowded, makes the exibitions hard to enjoy, also depending what\u2019s on. and expensive to visit if travelling with family. The entrance area of the building,",
          "This is a must for everyone......not just architecture or art lovers. A spectacular design from the outside but also spectacular exhibition spaces on the inside. And not too big! Everything is breathtaking but the Joan Vasconcelos woven and knitted sculpture spanning three",
          "If art/ other exhibitions are something you enjoy you will enjoy this venue. A spectacular building on the riverside in the wonderful city of Bilbao.",
          "This museum was on our list of things to see and destinations In Spain. As we walked through the City, we could feel the excitement in the streets as we approached this famous museum. There was so much going on around the museum, the building as well as all of the pieces of art",
          "What an amazing building and a chance to see some fantastic art in a one off venue. The Picasso and Giacometti collection is so good and not busy this time of the year. We found it best to get our tickets at the venue and they include the use of an audio guide for a large number",
          "Cannot visit Bilbao without going to the Guggenheim, the building itself is a work of art for goodness sake. Numerous galleries over 3 floors all full accessible with audio guides if needed. Take the time to see the sculptures on the outside of the building whilst you are there.",
          "My second visit in 3 years. Because of the rotating collection I felt it was worth another trip. I appreciate the museum now offers audio device with ticket to get more detail on some of the art. The value of the museum however remains the building exterior and the outside",
          "Whitney in NYC, Vuitton in Paris, MassMoca, renovated MOMA, and Guggenheim Bilbao. All great but Guggenheim Bilboa very special to navigate from within and appreciate from either side of river. Best place to appreciate Richard Serra. Keifers also interesting but Mass Moca",
          "Nice place but as usual in Spain, foreigners and even more French people are not welcome! Good exposition but unfriendly and very cold welcome!",
          "Was able to take an entire afternoon and make my way slowly through the many exhibits on display. Some of the most impressive pieces of art I've had the privilege of seeing. Plus it was very affordable, and every entry purchase came with an audio guide.",
          "A must see if you travel to the Basque Country. Plan to catch the light the way you want it because of the way it is situated in the valley. Then consider visiting the Rioja wineries designed by Frank Gehry too.",
          "The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao is a museum of modern and contemporary art designed by Canadian-American architect Frank Gehry is simple the Best! Not to be missed is Jeff Koons, Guggenheim Puppy and the Fog Sculpture de Fujiko Nakaya Colorful Tulips by Jeff Koons.",
          "I've been itching to visit the Guggenheim since it opened to such fanfare more than 20 years ago! And does it ever live up to its billing! We spent a whole day there and came back a second just to eat in the restaurant and walk around the outside. It made me such a Frank Gehry",
          "mix of modern and classical art at leisurely pace. 16 euros per adult. we had a chance to see some of pieces by Van Gogh, Monet, Manet, Rousseau. great experience.",
          "Loved it! The architecture is breathtaking! Calcullate at least 1.5 - 2 hours for insinde and 1 hour to circle it from outside! Also food and service at the Bistro was excellent!",
          "An exciting building extremely well set on its location. The outside experience is almost as good as the inside. The interior lobby spaces are brilliant and well defined to handle large crowds. I found the galleries in general a disappointment. The rooms themselves were dull",
          "The Guggenheim museum was brilliant, apart from the building looking fantastic and the giant spider outside, the inside was great as it was interactive in many ways. My three year old boy thought it was brilliant and didn\u2019t want to leave. Easy to go round with a toddler and",
          "This is an iconic building worth a journey. The art is a matter of taste and may not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea. The number of works on display was fewer than we expected. The best exhibit is the building. Prices were typical for the experience and the cafe was great and",
          "What else? A must do in Bilboa. Picasso, Manet, Van Gogh, Renoir, Monet, Matisse, Rousseau, Cezanne & Giacometti..., to name a few! Advance online ticket purchase is suggested. It\u2019s relatively small, so 2-3 hours is sufficient. There are audio guides available w/ online advance",
          "One of the floors was closed during our visit, but despite that, the collection was diverse, tactile, fun and inspiring. Several installations were interactive, which made it that much more interesting. Add to all that, the city views are great too. Get there as early as",
          "This was on my bucket list and now one of my favourite galleries and spaces. Excellently curated, curiously laid out and beautiful views inside and out and let\u2019s not forget a giant dog in flowers gracing the forcourt. Loved the eclectic art and excellent descriptions. Not too",
          "Absolutely amazing, Definitely the museum that defines the city. Marvellous buiding, excellent exhibits. I was lucky enough to see the Vasconcelos exhibits the day I visited the museum.",
          "This is an indoor and outdoor experience and you really have to do both. The building design and construction is so interesting and cool. An incredible puppy, poppys, fog and more and then you enter the building and are just blown away. By the way, they have a wonderful gift",
          "I have wanted to see the Guggenheim in Bilbao for such a long time and it was worth the wait. The building itself is spectacular. Not a straight line in sight and lots of little nooks and crannies to explore. We walked over the footbridge and managed to get some brilliant views",
          "The Guggenheim is what brought us to Bilbao. Gehry buildings abound in the world and we have seen many. Both the outdoor space and indoor space are wonderful with fun things to see. The cafe was excellent and no need to enter the museum to use it.",
          "Stunning, I was unsure as I thought it would just be another museum but it was fantastic so much to do and see and interactive pieces too! Stunning building",
          "If you're in Bilbao, you simply must visit the Guggenheim. Actually, if you ARE in Bilbao, you have probably come to visit the museum . And it really is worth going. One of the world's most iconic buildings, full of brilliant modern art. We were lucky enough to catch Joanna",
          "I'm not much into art...frankly, I was more impressed by the architecture of the building than the art inside. Much of it was modern art, which may have just been bad timing on my part, but I would have preferred more historical paintings and sculptures. Art fanatics likely",
          "Much has been written about this famous art gallery in central Bilbao. We were lucky this time as several top class exhibits included a wonderful collection featuring works by van Gogh to Picasso drawn from the Thannhauser legacy. This collection includes works by household",
          "This Museum is awesome on both the outside and the inside! One of Architect Frank O. Gehry's Masterpieces. and the collection inside is impressive too!",
          "Stunning building; beautiful art. Do the audio tour. We spent about three absolutely enjoyable hours here, and would have returned if we had more time in Bilbao. Amazing collection and breathtaking views from every level.",
          "Totally worth going ... we did audio tour I think it was worthwhile. The cafe was very good too and I thought the prices were reasonable for a museum cafe",
          "Everyone go to Bilbao cause this museum.The story of this city was inspired to many place in the world.Art and attitide change everything.Great place to take time around this place.Space and envirionment is nice.But this building is no lighting at night.",
          "We visited Guggenheim museum in October and it was absolutely amazing. There was scaffolding all around Puppy as they were trimming and watering plants. But other than that our visit was fantastic. Very nice staff (although quite stressed in the cloak room) and the exhibits",
          "I am not a museum lover but the Guggenheim is one I would revisit if I had the opportunity. We spent a lot of time walking on the outside of the Guggenheim because the architecture is so unique. Once inside we were enchanted by the exhibits on display. Everything is \"over the",
          "A fantastic museum to visit while in Bilbao with great exhibitions. Great architecture a real must see when in Bilbao.",
          "We visited Bilbao chiefly to see this museum and it was definitely worth the transport hassles we had (we were travelling by train and crossed over the border into Spain on the west coast of France). This building made the trip worthwhile, it must rank in the list of top amazing",
          "We visited the Guggenheim on a Sunday morning and spent almost three hours visiting the various floors. There were three exhibitions, the highlight and my favourite being the Joanna Vasconcelos exhibition on the ground floor. The other two exhibitions were Chagall 1911-1919, and",
          "The building was as impressive as expected. The exhibitions a real mix - even our teenagers who generally avoid modern art enjoyed several of them. Trip spoiled but unpleasant security staff.",
          "As many people say, the iconic building is fantastic and eclipses the art collection. It is however a must for any visitor to Bilbao. It can get crowded so go early or late.",
          "Don't miss the Guggenheim if you are in Bilbao! We spent about 3+hours with our 2 kids (5 and 7yr olds) excluding our lunch break. You can buy your ticket, start your visit, get your lunch outside and return to the museum... just dont forget to get a tag from security. We were",
          "We hiked the Basque region of France and Spain before going to Bilbao to tour the Guggenheim. It was fantastic. The museum is an architectural masterpiece and the displays are interesting and in some cases, mind bending. We were going to spend a few hours there on our way to",
          "Obviously the building itself is phenomenal, but I was excited to discover the artwork of Joana Vasconsuelos. I\u2019m the type that doesn\u2019t pay that much attention to those audio accompanying descriptions or sometimes hurries through certain exhibits, but I was mesmerized by her",
          "The recent novel ORIGIN starts out at this museum. The book got me curious. Fortunately it was a stop on our recent cruise. Amazing place, a do not miss museum. Be sure to visit the giant spider outside and marvel at the building inside. Whether you enjoy modern art or not, this",
          "Amazing building, really a Frank Gerry's master piece even though the exhibitions inside are not so much of worth",
          "The building alone is worth the trip, the plus is what\u2019s inside. Some very unusual exhibits are displayed there, as well as some really unusual outdoor exhibits as well. They have an extensive MARC Chagall exhibit as well.",
          "The Guggenheim was so interesting. As a person who isn\u2019t super into modern art, I thought the exhibits were incredible and it sparked an interest in me. There are a few exhibits outside along the river and if you time it right you can see the fog. In addition to my visit to",
          "Cool place to spend time with colleague kids. We ride metro subway. Easy to access to entrance. Since Aug.was vacation time, museum was too busy to enjoy.",
          "Brilliant but book online to avoid queueing! You also need to set aside a full day to see all the exhibitions and walk the perimeter.",
          "I had booked this particular trip because of a controversial Chinese exhibit, which was later apparently censored. Inside of the museum is OK, free headset, but really the attraction is the building itself. From the outside, you can see the spider and puppy statues and the",
          "Saw the Guggenheim posters around Bilbao with a .Venetian mask on them which looked intriguing.As we gad vusited the museum twice before we decided to go just to see the visiting exhibition- and if course \" Puppy\" the huge flower-covered dog! The Vasconsuelos exhibit was",
          "We pre-paid for our tickets only to discover that the day we would have gone was very busy. The friendly staff let us change the date of our tickets with no price change. If you like modern art its a wonderful museum (its not very big at all and you can get round it in about",
          "The Guggenheim in Bilbao is my favourite. This stunning piece of architecture by the amazing Frank Gehry always houses the most interesting exhibitions and I have revisited many times over the years.",
          "I think this is my new favourite museum. Give yourself the whole day, get the audio guide, enjoy. Oh, and do make time for the lunch in the bar area too. Fantastic.",
          "The building itself of course is the best artwork. It has interesting works surrounding the building. There is an excellent audio guide. The highlights for me, were Richard Serra\u2019s giant iron torqued ellipses, The Chagall expo and Joana Vasconcelos. Essential to visit when in",
          "Don\u2019t miss this elaborately designed learning museum. Go early, save wristband and come back later. Discover the outside as well. Go top to bottom and plan for three hours.",
          "Collection of the museum (or whatever they exhibit from permanent collection) is just the right amount to get a good feel for 20th century contemporary art but what really was amazing is the temporary exhibutions and their content. i was blown away by the 3 exhibitions",
          "Not excellent but nice This is it I do not anything to add I really don't have anything else I hope this is enough",
          "The Guggenheim-Bilbao\u2019s collection of paintings and sculpture is worthy of its magnificent architecture. The Frank Gehry building seems interwoven with the art collection itself. Even the act of moving through the museum from hall to hall is an artistic experience.",
          "Impressive building. We booked our tickets and audio tour online which I would recommend to avoid the queues . It\u2019s well worth the visit as even if art is not your thing there is something for everyone",
          "Everyone who visits Bilbao has to go at the museum.Not extremely big, you have to spend 2-3 hours.The standard exhibition very nice.",
          "It\u00b4s absolutly an amazing and beautiful building from the outside, the arquitecthure is unique, and inside is also so interesting for all. You can\u00b4t miss it.",
          "Ok absolutly loved it !!!! The perment collection is very interesting and the exhibit that was visiting was from the Artist Joana Vasconcelos. It is there until November 11th. If you are close by you should go. If you are visiting you should go. The sculptures outside are great.",
          "I was intending to only view the building from the outside as we only have 2 days in Bilbao. However, as the weather was bad we reluctantly decided to queue and pay the entrance fee - about \u00a315. Book online in advance is best as it avoids about 30 minutes queuing time. Once",
          "These people think on a different level than the people I know. This is truly on the cutting edge of art, science and architecture. Everything looks really impressive but much of it has to be explained to this farm boy.",
          "Not the only reason to visit Bilbao, but one of the best. The building itself is worth a visist, one of the most relevant masterpieces of contemporary architecture in the world surrounded by some others. Wonderful permanent and temporary modern art exhibitions.",
          "Guggenheim museum is a building that changed the destiny of the city of Bilbao. And we can say no more. The architecture is fantastic, you can sit somewhere and just look at it. The fountain, the fire sometimes, the bridge nearby, and dog statue - each side is enriched. The",
          "When seeing this building for the first time, you realize what a true artist and visionary can create. Greatness! A modern day wonder of the world. Frank O. Gehry has designed some of the most iconic, beautiful and unconventional buildings in the world. The Guggenheim in Bilbao,",

          "The amazing Frank Gehry gallery is the most extraordinary piece of sculpture you can walk through, be sure to go to the huge gallery of the commissioned steel shapes to see the extraordinary geometry that makes it all work. At once monumental and gravity defying.",
          "The most special building (in&out) that I have ever seen. If you have time, visit the museum inside. The building and the exhibitions are great.",
          "The building is stunning, commanding an impressive riverside location and presenting many fascinating outdoor exhibits - like the F.O.G and Jeff Koons' puppy' But once inside I was underwhelmed. The building's layout makes navigation difficult and i thought the signage as poor.",
          "Interesting building next to the river in a beautiful city. We enjoyed the exposition of Joana Vasconcelos\u2019 art work. Plus the impressive work of Serra. The museum bistro/bar offered some nice sandwiches. The waiting time in line took quite a while. There were too many visitors",
          "The most stunning building. It is worth a visit just to look at it. We only saw the permanent collection but that is worth the entrance money by itself. We only went to Bilbao for the Guggenheim and it was worth it.",
          "you read about this museum and you always wonder if they are exagerating. they are not, it is a work of are inside and out. the displays are out of this world and the outside is breathtaking to see. plan to spend hours walking through the various exhibits, look up as well.",
          "Bilbao is a fantastic city for a 2-3 day break. Even if it was not, it is worth visiting just for the Guggenheim. The building is fantastic and the exhibition - permanent or not - is marvellous. An absolute must.",
          "Great museum and just a spectacular from the outside. One thing you must do is buy the tickets online. We bought them the day before and when we arrived, we could bypass the huge long queue. When you book online you have to say what time you are going. We had booked for 2 PM",
          "Well just don\u2019t skip this opportunity. Even if you don\u2019t enjoy art tour around the outside for free. You cannot fail to be impressed by the building. If you like contemporary art then it\u2019s worth the entrance fee. Excellent Chagall exhibition. Also catch the local Basque art",
          "both inside and out this venue is worth the trip. expect to spend at least two hours or more just to get round it inside and out at a glance. very imaginative and creative and a wonderful setting for people watching and eating as well",
          "You can't really say that you visted Bilbao without a trip to the Guggenheim...even a walk around the museum itself. There is a lot to see in the museum and a good few interactive pieces so you'd need between 2-3 hrs to complete the full tour. The main highlight for me was the",
          "The outside of the museum is as much of an attraction as is the inside with Puppy, Mama and the big rooster outside",
          "Let\u2019s face it - this is a fugly museum, especially the Koons \u00ab art piece \u00bb in front. For some reason people seem to like it. Oh well.",

I had just been in the Reine Sofia and it is ten times more interesting.",

          "Incredible architecture! The colours of the building changes with the weather. Inside however, the art collection was a bit of a disappointment: thin but beautifully exhibited. Would\u2019ve been nice to be warned, at the ticket booth, about one complete floor being closed...",
          "It is a must visit place when you\u2019re in this city although you\u2019re not an art fan. There are enough things to see outside of this museum and the way for a walk along the river is really nice. The exhibition was 10\u20ac including audio guide so \u2026",
          "Interesting architecture and modern art exhibits. Not my cup of tea but when in Bilbao it is a must. 3.5 stars",
          "The Richard Serra installation is worth the ticket price alone. The building is gorgeous. The paintings are not too shabby either. Van Gogh and some great German watercolors.",
          "Beautiful architecture in Bilbao. Nice to walk outside the museum and take pictures of the sculpture filled surroundings. Don't forget to take souvenir photos of the puppy and the spider.",
          "The building is fantastic and gets the stars-the art inside, very disappointing! Second floor closed, third floor partially closed and what is open is dismal. There are so many past & current talented artists in the world and they display \u2026",
          "Amazing museum in a simple friendly city. The exterior design is phenomenal but is just the first step in experiencing the interior collection. Don't miss it if in Bilbao",
          "A magnificent architectural building just in the center of Bilbao. Definitely worth the visit of the art exhibitions inside, where not only you can admire the arts of famous artists, but you can also admire the building from other perspectives. The ticket for adults cost 17\u20ac  and you can have the audio guide for free as well.",
          "Extraordinary, vast museum with some of the best works in contemporary art. A must see, Prepare to spend a few hours rejoicing in outstanding architecture, sculpture, painting, and film.\nCons: I found only two (2) exhibits by female artists.",
          "A must stop in Bilbao. Striking exhibitions for both art lovers and the common man alike. Fun for children and food for thought for the grown-ups. The architecture itself is worth a visit and the different exhibitions are small enough that \u2026",
          "The afternoon (near 6pm) is a great time to visit it because a vapour is released from the bottom of the building",
          "An architectural marvel. Situated on the banks of the Estuary of Bilbao, this place is a must visit for all tourists. The seamless architecture both inside and outside of the museum is a nexus ot both engineering and design. The museum has \u2026",
          "Exceeded my expectations especially because I usually don't get modern art. The displays here really made the art work shine. Some of the pieces were emotionally quite powerful.",
          "Well worth the entrance fee. The building is worth a visit even if you don't care for the art! Stunning architecture. Good guides make it all the more understandable and the concept behind the building, how it was built, why titanium was used are all succinctly explained. Too much to take in with just one visit. We'll be back!",
          "Architectural design of Guggenheim Museum is extraordinary both inside and outside. It's definitely the first building that prominently pops up in Bilbao. \n\nTake a very good look at everything inside this museum, because they are made by or \u2026",
          "I was completely mesmerized by Gehry's building. Every angle is a photo opportunity, and yet, the galleries are not overwhelmed by the architecture. The art is allowed to speak for itself. A magnificent statement of modern artistic endeavor.",
          "Wonderful place for everybody, it is a must in your trip to Bilbao. I have been twice and it is always different",
          "We stopped off en route to San Sebastian simply because it was the Guggenheim. It didn't disappoint. The external architecture was brilliant and a true testimony to the US architect Frank Gehry. If you are passing through Bilbao it is a must see.\nThe surrounding river side gardens are pleasant and add to the overall experience",
          "Not enough variation of art to be enticing for a mix of people. The building and the spider were the highlight for us. Still glad we went and yes the building is a work of art being built with so many curves it messes with your sense of balance",
          "The outside look is fantastic. Roomy and spacy. But the content inside needs to be richer.",
          "Regarded as one of the most spectacular buildings in the world, and a Masterpiece of Architecture in 20th century, Guggenheim Museum is the home to Modern and Contemporary arts. Its unique exterior built with Titanium panels is reflecting attractive metallic glamour. A Must visit Site.",
          "I was taken with the way the contemporary exhibits seemed to complement the architecture of the building itself.",
          "I'm not a fan of modern art, but the place is great. Arrive early to enjoy a quiet surrounding, book online to skip the line, finish the visit at the coffee to recharge your battery... We spent 2:30 hours. Wheel chair access everywhere.",
          "Speechless museum, impossible to describe, incredible experience: just go and feel.",
          "You just have to go inside and explore!  Content as impressive as outfit! Unforgettable experience.",
          "Beautiful place, very huge inside with an incredible architecture. There are some temporary shows which are amazing! Suggested",
          "Incredible architecture, it is a must see... At least from the outside if you are not a museum people like me, kids can play outside, there is a nice open fountain for them to get wet, a big playground and a place for a cold beer. Nice \u2026",
          "Good exhibition. Excellent architecture. Best seen from the outside. Great street artists surround the building. All worth watching.",
          "Didn't go inside but the external facade and surrounding infrastructure is great to see.\nWe particularly enjoyed this at night.\n\nWould recommend coming as you will fit in some Tapas/Pinxtos while you're in Bilbao.\n\nPlease like my review \ud83d\udc4d",
          "We spent 3 hours there. Headsets/ audio excellent way to get explanations of exhibits. Plenty to see. Space to enjoy exhibits. The building is amazing.",
          "In a continent fill of museums, this isn't best example of a museum. The architecture is superb but the art lets it down",
          "Loved it! Absolutely stellar intrinsic and extrinsic design, great shapes and lines, fabulous choice of the exhibitions. Worth the visit and must me on your bucket list if you enjoy contemporary art.",
          "Great Museum, it is not only about what you see, there is a lot of meaning behind the scenes and that makes it special! Not all will find your enthusiasm, but it is a current cross section of art. ...and cool building too!",
          "Not many artworks and of them not very good, just literally a couple of interesting bits. Expensive for a mostly vacuous space literally and otherwise.",
          "An excellent museum that is, in my view, more impressive than the Guggenheim in NYC.",
          "Lovely building. Contains very well spaced obscure art. Nice gift shop. Adults \u20ac10. Seniors \u20ac6. Free audio guide is an option.",
          "It's like so many monuments: the outside is spectacular, no need to visit \"inside\".\nThe architecture seen from the outside is really very spectacular. We also visited the inside and I was really disappointed. Not only by the architecture but also by the art displayed. Best of all was the \"Gerhard Richter\" exhibition.",
          "Amazing architecture,very unique and impressive. Very dissapointed with art selection. Not much to see or admire. Worth being there once.  Lots of empty space and no exposition that would invite me to be back",
          "Great building, architectonic gem, however in comparison with other famous museums, exhibitions are relatively week.",
          "The building itself is impressive, but it is a bit of a mismatch with the city. The exhibitions are unimpressive.",
          "Incredible building, born not engineered. Like a bionic creature evolving from the deep. Inspired, and ever changing with perspective and time of day.",
          "Exterior and interior design definitely better than expositions inside. First floor expositions were perfect but fotography exposition on second floor was  strongly not objective and have not to much correlation with reality. One the third floor room of Kieffer was excellent and others less interesting.",
          "Amazing! Children enjoyed the audio handsets and looking for the numbers. There are a couple of children audios, but would be great if there were more. Staff really helpful and friendly.",
          "Def worth a visit while in Bilbao \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude00 \u20ac15 pp",
          "The building is extraordinary! Truly Ghery's masterpiece.\nWhat's inside is... iconoclastic. \nThis very modern view of art is not for the ordinary museum goer. Especially if you're with young children, you may wish to focus on the fun photo ops outside.",
          "Spectacular architecture, amazing contemporary art exhibits in spacious areas on three floors of the museum.",
          "The time of my visit they were showing dog day afternoon true story brilliant",
          "This is my highlight of how an impressive building can be a compete disappointment on the inside. Huge spaces allocated by pointless sculptures and printouts of entirely ordinary photos.\nDon't waste your time and money and go inside.",
          "Like all Modern Art Museums your experience will depend on what exhibitions are running.  On our visit an entire floor was closed.  Modern Art is also very like Marmite; you either love it or hate it.",
          "The building structure was impressive, but definitely seemed like it had seen better days.  The exhibits were okay. All-in-all I would visit it once but I don't feel the need to go back.  Others I spoke to who had been to the Guggenheum, Bilbao seemed similarly underwhelmed.",
          "So I am not a fan of modern art so I was quite sceptical about going in. \nI am still sceptical about modern art. But some of the installations, especially Richard Serra work, impressed me.",
          "Amazing museum. I did like the exhibitions inside, but the outside is amazing. You need to visit it during the day and come back after the sunset. The museum gains a different identity at nught with the light. A must visit for sure!",
          "Good place for the Contemporary Art. But strangely they don't allow taking photos inside!!! Here in Paris, all museums, contemporary and classical, are much more advanced, flexible and tolerant about taking photos.",
          "A great way to spend a morning is roaming the galleries. The range of different forms of art is amazing. Recommend that everyone gets the audio guide because it adds so much to the enjoyment. It must also be remembered that some items are outside, whether the puppy out front or the wonderful spider on the river side.",
          "The museum is amazing - both the building and the expos. But super strict \u00ab no photo \u00bb policy and staff who is always behind your back kind of distorts the experience.",
          "The building itself is a magnificent work of art! From the inside, you can see how all these different materials work together to form\nThe structure of the Guggenheim. Jenny Holzer\u2019s work is delightful. Full with sociopolitical commentary, \u2026",
          "You really have to see this building to believe it \u2014 no photograph has ever done justice to this symphony of shapes, so alive that they seem ready to take wing. American architect Frank Gehry used blocks of limestone and undulating sheets \u2026",
          "Must visit! Incredible architecture. The outside of the museum is the best for me.",
          "A cultural icon of Spain, this museum has breathtaking architecture on the outside an inside, however the exhibitions are lacking anything special, of you only want to experience the exhibits there are better museums  peppered around Bilbao. Still an essential attraction to visit in Bilbao",
          "Really worth visiting when in Bilbao! You can easily spend hour or more exploring the building inside and out!",
          "Great building, nice cafe, and there's art there too. How much you like the art will, of course, vary from person to person. I liked about half of it. Some was annoying, which I hear is a good thing, but some I found uninteresting.",
          "Amazing design, perfect layout for Richard Serra's works.  Very well curated.  I very much appreciated the limited collection, but plenty of depth.  It allowed one to absorb each artist more completely, to contemplate their work without being jolted from one to another incessantly.",
          "Fantastic! That's all I can say. Your eyes have a feast right out side the building with the flower dog, the spider, and some weird flowers. Inside is different kind of art. I can't say it was all my cup of tea, but I did appreciate it and enjoyed the conversations that were going on about them.",
          "Temple of Art and masterpiece of human civilization. I would include it in the miracles of the contemporary world",
          "Amazing works both in the permanent collection and in the temporary exhibits. The audio guide is really well done. It explains the works in a plain manner and sometimes includes the voices of the artists themselves talking about their creations. Definitely one of the highlights of our trip to Basque Country.",
          "Except the customer service in the shop. The women were more interested in talking to each other than attending to the guests",
          "Wonderful museum. Outdoor spaces are also marvelous. Great views from the windows and 2nd floor",
          "If you want to have fun; try to make pictures. In many areas it's not alowed to make pictures. Its a nice museum for young people and adults. Very nice architecture also!",
          "Amazing architecture. You must visit once in your life.",
          "A great place to visit.. not just the collections but the grounds.. sit by the river.. dine across the way and watch the diverse people visiting the area..",
          "Astonishing from the outside, but somehow messy and boring inside...",
          "Haven't been inside (do not like modern art), but was very much impressed by the outside: absolutely wonderful material, luminous at every weather, even by cloudy sky. Puppy is the most important part of the city life. Very stilish hotel building behind the museum",
          "If you love contemporary art, you must visit here. Architects and outside arts (Jeff Koons, Louise Bourgeois, etc) are amazing. Their permanent collection has less number of arts than expected and compared to Guggenheim in Venetia but it\u2019s worth seeing such as Basquiat, Andy Warhol .",
          "A superb museum.  Lots to see and lots to think about as well.  Some of the art left a bit too be desired but overall we thoroughly enjoyed it. Loved Bilbao as well!",
          "Loved the Guggenheim from the outside, great building, loved the flower dog. Didn't get the art at all and as for the film, terrible. \u20ac10 entry fee, expensive. I do not feel the need to return.",
          "The building is beautiful and the cafes were good. Did not enjoy the exhibits much maybe I just didn't get them. The staff were generally quite rude and unwelcoming, I even saw one guy shooing people rather than talking to them I could see \u2026",
          "I really had high expectations for this museum having seen its counterpart in New York. The building is five stars as is the cute puppy outside, for the exhibits inside one star. One of the most disappointing exhibitions I have seen Europe. Suggest you take a walk around the building, have a look at the puppy and move on.",
          "Our second visit. First time it was wonderful. This time the architecture is still jaw dropping, but not the same impact the second time around. But we found the displays were not inspiring. Perhaps our lack of appreciation of certain genres - but we loveld the first visit so cannot be complete Philistines!",
          "Mesmerizing museum. The building is the core of its part of the city, surrounded by the Bilbao River, a huge park and the entrance to the city center. The architecture is incredible and there is an interesting collection of sculptures in \u2026",
          "Feels churlish to say it, but the best thing about the Guggenheim Bilbao is the building, which is truly spectacular - like a living, breathing thing. It\u2019s worth visiting just to stand in the atrium and feel the same awe you get in great \u2026",
          "Masterpiece by Ar. Frank Gehry. The play of light and built form in the central atrium is a one of its kind experience",
          "The museum itself is amazing when it comes to its architectural value, its relevance to bask development and its importance to the city. I was really looking forward to seeing great displays within it.\nBut... Except for the steel plate art \u2026",
          "Outstanding architecture! Only went outside as it was the best part. Every hour they release steam from a pond.  Very fun",
          "A rally great experience! I throughly enjoyed every part of it! Was not to badly priced with such amazing pieces of art work!",
          "Lots to see from some big names in the art world. Be aware though that some of the exhibitions are adult themed (one contained themes about waterboarding), which I get what the artists are trying to achieve,  but not for children. A good \u2026",
          "I hadn\u2019t planned on visiting this museum because I generally don\u2019t like modern art museums. It\u2019s worth visiting just to see the outside art and architecture- it\u2019s a genuinely astoundingly beautiful structure.  The art collection is not my cup of tea but I don\u2019t regret the 2-3 hours I spent there.",
          "Outside of the museum is incredible. Inside the art is cool too. :) words can't describe it, definitely a must see.",
          "A must see if you are going to Bilbao. Impressive from the outside and thought-provoking on the inside. The architechture of the museum and the sculptures surrounding it are impressive, but so are the expositions it holds. Definitely recommended.",
          "Really spectacular museum. I normally do not have much patience for museums, but the architecture and diversity of exhibitions kept me going for many hours. Highly recommended.\nPrice was \u20ac17 on 2019-06-12",
          "Cool building, not a huge amount to see inside but worth a visit.",
          "Tour de force (tour de farce?) architecture, somewhat weak curation of art.",
          "Stunning building. Really amazing to look at. Really a beautiful piece of architecture. The museum is brilliant too.",
          "Fabulous building and outside sculptures even if you never venture inside - although you will miss some amazing modern sculptures and paintings if you don't.  Highly recommend.",
          "Didn't have all the artists I wanted to see on display for some reason. And you can't take photos, even if your flash is turned off. Food prices were reasonable.",
          "Excellent. The permanent Richard Serra exhibition is amazing!",
          "Architecture even better in person than photos",
          "Audioguides are too descriptive. They describe in a very detailed way what is on the picture instead of giving a context about the artwork and the artist. Apart from that the museum is a lot of fun",
          "Great day to wander around and see the art and the building",
          "This is a fantastic museum. The building itself is a work of art.",
          "Both the exhibits inside the museum, as well as the building itself holding it, are excellent and well worth a visit.",
          "Building is so cool   Art is a bit too organized. No pictures allowed, kind of old school    I like arts in musuem of fine arts better",
          "What a great place to visit. No trip to Bilbao is complete without seeing some of the crazy things at the Guggenheim. Do It!!!!!",
          "Only visited to see the outside,  but enjoyed looking at all angles of the building and seeing how it reflected light.  There are great views from the nearby bridge",
          "This was a great place to visit. My son loved the video show. The building itself is beautiful, and worth a walk around . It also has a great playground outside it..",
          "Thank goodness for Frank Gehry as the building and the outside art was the only thing I liked about the Guggenheim in Bilbao.  The whole second floor was dedicated to anti-American and anti-men rhetoric.  The first floor has very expensive \u2026",
          "Architecture is Great!  Don\u2019t go inside, especially with children!  What some may call creativity is pretty sick stuff!  Sad to see El Greco there amongst the junk. Worth walking around the outside. I hope they can find some real artists to fill the voids someday.",
          "As museums go, it's not particularly large. It's possible to see everything in under 2 hours. Personally, I found that the actual building and architecture was my favorite artwork. Overall though, this is a very neat museum and if you're anywhere in northern Spain you should stop by here.",
          "The building itself is very beautiful. The items inside might require a special mindset and some time to understand. Visiting such museum can be a good starter for long and deep conversations, it can be a bit boring and tiring at the same time.",
          "What a great museum.  I am not a huge fan of modern art, but this museum did help me appreciate it more. The museum itself has magnificent architecture.  You can easily spend 30 minutes just walking around the exterior of the museum \u2026",
          "This building is a ruin of the future and appropriately treated as an elaborate urinal. I prefer a beach or forest. It is an artifact of Nihilism.  The main exhibit is space, nothingness. \nI entered on two occasions. The first time on 30 \u2026",
          "Was not too crowded on the day so enough time and space to discover the pieces of art",
          "An essential place to visit in Bilbao. The building itself is the main subject, but they do have very interesting exhibtions sometimes too. This is a building to experience rather than 'see' , well worth the visit.",
          "Everyone will have their own opinion of the art on display but there is little doubt that architecturally the building is stunning and the use of the internal space beautiful. It remains a justifiable highlight of Bilbao.",
          "One of the most amazing architectural building I have seen  more people taking photos of building outside than in.  Loved it",
          "Loved the design and some of the exhibitions.  They could do more to make it more interactive for kids.  The Audio tours are world class.",
          "So much to see! Not your regular art gallery. Sotos interactive exhibits were my favourite.",
          "What a fabulous place, worth every penny. Go an visit, it's a must. Could spend a full day there if you have the time. Not suitable for unsupervised children as they are very strict about going too near all the  exhibitions",
          "It\u2019s famous so no detailed review needed. But even if you\u2019re not that into art, still a great experience. For me, the building made it.",
          "A must see in Bilbao. It's beautiful. The art is amazing. We took wonderful pictures. It was definitely worth the visit.",
          "Must see in Bilbao.  Outstanding permanent exhibition of Richard Serra's and other select artists' fine works complemented by periodic exhibitions of top notch contemporary artists.  Warrants even a visit for merely seeing the building and grounds to appreciate the architectural achievement.",
          "A must see if you come to Bilbao. The architecture is stunning and the exhibitions are absolutely...modern in their concept. Sometimes disturbing, often amazing...not to be missed.",
          "We went with kids and they had enjoy it. Good examples of art...",
          "Famous museum in Bilbao designed by the American architect Frank Gehry. It is about a half hour walk from the city centre. The exhibits change regularly so even if you've visited it before a second visit shouldn't disappoint. There are giant art pieces outside the museum, including a spider, which are very impressive.",
          "Astonishing place.  If the contents don't get you, the building probably will.  The exhibits aren't as way out as you may find in MOMA or Tate Modern and that's perhaps why this place works.   Allow at least 2-3 hours to get what you can \u2026",
          "5 stars is not enough. Beautiful, Astounding and truly Magnificent.  It will blow you away. The site in the center of Bilbao with Ancient and Modern is a feeling of being in a dream",
          "For those who love contemporary art it's a must visit. However, the museum's architecture is a masterpiece in itself & will not disappoint.  Lovely visit that leaves a visitor with plenty to think about through it's multitude of concepts shown at the exhibition. Highly recommend.",
          "The design and outside sculptures are superb the puppy, spider, tulips and the silver spheres. Plus the visual display eg fog flames and laser display are also stunning especially at night. The  exhibits inside are not so spectacular. I \u2026",
          "Soto exhibit is stunning. This is one of my favorite museums in all of Europe.",
          "The building itselt is stunning. But we really didn't like the exposition. Modern art ok, but this was just too much for our taste \ud83d\ude0a",
          "In front and back of the building there are beautiful arts created by Jeff Koons. \u2018Puppy\u2019 was covered with lots of flowers which was so pretty. There are many interesting intense subjects of arts. Definitely worth visiting.",
          "If two massive wobbled granite plates that look like wood best describe your perception of time, this is the place for you! If not, stay away. There are way too many stairs, it's boring and way too expensive considering what it is and there \u2026",
          "If you are near or in Bilbao you should not miss this world class museum.",
          "This is a long way for a Southerner from Tallahassee, even one that has lived in New York for two decades and been to the Met and many of the other art museums of the city. It did not disappoint.",
          "Never been inside (yet), but it is very big. 4 floors with a lot to see. The environment around the museum is beautiful. Its the main attraction point in Bilbao. Give it a shot !",
          "Amazing. Not to be missed if you are in Bilbao. The exhibitions were inspiring (Holzer, Kiefer...) but the masterpiece is obviously the building itself. Impressive from the in- and the outside with very different impressions during the day - we went there twice to appreciate it. Wonderful place!",
          "Amazing architecture inside and outside! Will take some shots at sunset and share them on my Instagram soon.\nIG: giuseppecannavoo",
          "A special place to visit and must for anyone visiting Bilbao. You don\u2019t need to be an architect or artist to appreciate this spectacular building. Good value to visit, even the cafe if not a rip off which some places like this can take advantage of. \nA building you will never forget.",
          "I really enjoyed the visit. The building is an art piece in itself. Although I am not a big fan of modern art I enjoyed every minute of it.",
          "Such a beautiful and inspiring building, a great place to visit, special views. Beautiful paintings with nice explications and stories.",
          "The architecture of the building itself and surroundings are really beautiful. Take a sweater if you want to go inside, the aircondition is strong. If you are with kids let them play outside in the fountains or green grass rather than take them inside. This museum and art itself are for adults.",
          "This place will totally blow your mind. The building itself is a piece of art. Andy Warhol's Marilyn Monroe is housed in this museum in permanent collection. Remember that this is a very contemporary art museum and has works from 20th century until the current day.",
          "Some of the best and thought provoking works of our time. Well worth it.",
          "Excellent structure for fresh flowers and vines. Beautifully done. Very popular with tourists and families.",
          "Didnt like it waste of time and money",
          "Saw the Strokes last night. Pretty epic show. Parker is jamming out to them in the shower now. That parker is quite the dude. Everett is grabbing lunch with a friend and Michelle is packing. I'm laying in bed.",
          "If you like modern museums  this is the place for .About a 100yds west a very nice little cafe ,nice red wine cheap toasties.",
          "The building is as amazing as any of the art works inside",
          "Amaizing architecture of building, interisting exibitions, I liked that visit. In the evening lights it also look amaizing around outside.",
          "Great place to visit with family. They also have complimentary jacket and bags storage for everyone",
          "Very magic place, unreal architecture and amazing colours that reflects on the buildings like sky, clouds! We didn't visit inside the Museum as we have been told that the externals are better than what is actually exhibited! Worth the visit!",
          "Great building architecture made from titanium. It's a modern arts musem inside",
          "The outside was amazing and architecturally incredible. When we went inside, it was much less interesting.  The 2nd floor main exhibit was under construction and the other exhibits were interesting but not compelling. Also the inside architure  wasn't nearly as interesting as the outside.",
          "Stunning architecture and some wholly original art pieces, with many interesting exhibitions on inside. It's a must see spot for anyone visiting the city of Bilbao.",
          "Great installations and cross section of art offerings. Well worth it.",
          "A very impressive structure that will leave you in awe.",
          "Best museum ever seen if you like contemporary art",
          "We visited this museum as part of our gala dinner for ESRA2019 event in Bilbao \nAt night it is really interesting, the architecture, the lighting, this special characteristic and this first time experience for me \u201c night at the museum \u201c was truely beyond expectations \nIt made my stay in Bilbao unforgettable \nHighly recommended",
          "Impressive and disorienting - in a positive way. Exhausted after 2 hours (10am-noon).  By itself worth the trip to Bilbao.",
          "Exceeded expectations. The Richard Serra permanent exhibit is breathtaking.",
          "Wow. World class. 3 stories, 3 expositions easy to absorb, yet rich with content and curation.",
          "Real architectural wonder, thanks to Mr Gherry for this piece of architectural art!",
          "Such a wonderful masterpiece of architecture, a stand alone wonder. If you will look at it you will feel amazed by just outside structure. All other arts and crafts are really amazing. As you will start with entrance a big puppy made out of \u2026",
          "I did liked the exhibitions but the personal can be a bit rude and you can\u2019t take photos to anything not even the funny exhibitions",
          "Absolutely loved it! It's a great place to visit at least once and it suits single travelers and families with kids.",
          "The building is exceptional, the exhibitions were quite bland. Not as impressive as one might expect from such a famous museum. Furthermore, they could improve their organization in dealing with crowds. Staff did their very best to compensate for that.",
          "One of the largest attractions in bilbao, the guggenheim museum. The most spectacular part of the museum and the largest piece of art is the building itself. A beautiful monument. The museum inside has a large collection of modern art, huge \u2026",
          "For making the best Fotos from the building,cross the bridge south wall along the riverside take the escalator for the red bridge and walk back to the museum. You should do it not later than 10 am. You won't regret this walk \ud83d\ude0f",
          "wonderful museum a lot of special art but is not for free it cost 10 $ and there is a discount for students",
          "The architecture of the museum is marvelous and the grand sculptures is worth the entry. The collections inside is nothing out of your ordinary museum sadly, but I still recommend to visit to experience this masterpiece of a building!",
          "I'm not a major museum fan, but the architecture and exhibits in this museum captivated my imagination, and helped me get close to creative genius (Gehry's archi and Richard Ferris installation in particular, blew my hair back. I'm now in \u2026",
          "Bilbao!  Who knew?  I was pleasantly surprised at the town.  Please enjoy!",
          "Amazing museum",
          "Amazing building, easily spend a whole day here",
          "Great building from outside, interesting exhibitions inside. \nImpressed by current Thomas Struth exhibition",
          "Amazing architecture, not so impressive collections.",
          "The outside is nice.\nThe inside is ok.\nThe food was good,\nit was part of a conference.",
          "A must visit in Bilbao, both the inside and exterior are impressive.",
          "Loved this place. Gerhard ritcher's morning painting was great. The outside structures were good as well. Good balance of exhibits",
          "One of the installations is from Andy Warhol, it's about masses and the massification of wishes, so who am I to differentiate from everybody with a low judgement? :)\nGreat assembly of art, where the spectator should also remove the audio guide and submerge in the artists' work. Magnificent mix of art and life",
          "Everything was sparking clean. Beautiful sculptures outside are a must see. The architectural design of the building is stunning",
          "The architecture was fascinating. Every view from a different angle offered another possibility to associate the form of the building with another object. The curves within the building just gave it such an interesting dynamic which \u2026",
          "Amazing architecture. Beautiful surroundings.",
          "What else can be said from one of the most magnificent buildings of the late 90s, one that transformed the whole city and made it much more enjoyable and beautiful in order for tourist and locals to enjoy its river promenade and essentially \u2026",
          "A wonderful modern museum where you can hang around for many days always finding out stunning, exquisite details you'll never forget!",
          "Amazing building, art works underwhelming. Expensive. Suggest take photos from outside and don\u2019t go in.",
          "Interesting artwork from different exhibitors. Beautiful building, and the translator describing all the artist works is fabulous.",
          "Worth a visit. Mixture of modern and traditional styles.",
          "Dramatic iconic building. Good cafe and bistro. Can't say much for Jenny Holzer exhibition- very pretentious. More a political statement than actual art.",
          "If you like contemporary art, this is your place.",
          "My photography will do the talking. I was looking forward to seeing the place and I was not disappointed.",
          "An amazing jewel of architecture in the heart of bizkaia county. Amazing piece of architecture to wonder around and enjoy by the nervion river",
          "Surely a significant spot in Europe for arts lovers. Unique and appealing architecture, good organization. The items in the exhibitions are... Well modern art therefore much dependent on individual preferences and perception.",
          "Just brilliant,so much to see and do for both young and old",
          "Very eclectic! Not for everyone. Very economical and friendly staff.",
          "It's freaking Amazing \ud83d\ude0d",
          "A fun place with amazing architecture",
          "Unique architectural art. The art inside is not worth the entry fee. Better go to the quaint Fine Arts Museum. Especially the Zuloaga exhibit. Bilbao has other art centres.",
          "Amazing experience!  Definitely a must when in the region.  The building is an absolute surprise  and delight!  Admiring it is alone worth the visit!  Every corner and edge is unique and filled with delight.\n\nThe cherry on the cake is the \u2026",
          "Great museum. Some really interesting paintings / pieces.",
          "This amazing building is an artwork in itself. The permanent pieces are well worth exploring.  Not for people who don't appreciate modern art.",
          "Some will say this museum is small.  I disagree as it allows for taking the time to enjoy the exhibits.  Plus the architecture alone makes it worth seeing.",
          "Spectacular architecture but the actual exhibits I find are very hit or miss depending on your views on art. It costs 17 euro to enter which includes an audio guide. It seems as though over half of the museum consists of temporary exhibits which can either be spectacular or pretenscious",
          "A must see on your trip to northern Spain. Basque Country. The museum celebrates the local culture as well as featuring many modern installations.",
          "Contemporary art, beautiful. Of you are into this at, then this is a must see. Inspiring challenging, mind blowing and thoughtful.",
          "Really outstanding architecture masterpiece.  Sadly the arts housed within the museum is not as memorable and underwhelming.",
          "Spooked by a giant spider, got lost in a maze \n\n10/10",
          "I was incredibly disappointed when I visited the museum in Spain. There was NOTHING worth seeing. Two really sketchy exhibits that were a joke and besides the building itself, not much to see. A few pieces of pottery  and a room with some sketches. The museum should consider acquiring some art work.",
          "stunning building b\u00f2th jnside and out. Some of the art is excellent...some not so. Gets very busy in summer so booking ahead of time saves joining a big queue.",
          "Interesting temporary exhibitions on display. Gorgeous from the outside",
          "Lovely building. Lots of empty space though.",
          "Sadly, I was only able to see the outside grounds. However just the sight from any point is a delight. I checked the ticket windows and was surprised to find reasonably ticket prices when I was expecting much higher. A treat for the eye and a different cultural boost.",
          "Excellent: beautiful building, impressive exhibits, but a bit disappointing because two major galleries were closed today.",
          "I remember the reaction of me and my friends the first time we saw the museum ! It was like this \ud83d\ude2e ! Amazing, huge and very well conceived in the space of the city near the bridge and the river. Love this museum! Visited it two times in summer and winter",
          "Incredible architecture..... don\u2019t waste ten euro going inside.",
          "This was not my cup of tea.\nModern version of Emperor's New Clothes.\nUgly things that nobody dare say that they are ugly.\nThe building is more worth seeing than the things inside.",
          "Half of exposition is closed. Completely closed 2nd floor. Richter, Rotko is out of display. No signs or warnigs about it.  Building is a masterpiece. Museum experience is terrible. Starting with ticket check-in. Lady just grabbed and yanked my arm. My purse was to big. But museum staff don't know how to use words.",
          "Fantastic exposition and amazing building! We enjoyed with our kids (10, 15 and 17).",
          "Even though I am not specially interested in modern Art I normaly find something  interesting in every museum. Not here. It is not allowed to take pictures inside the museum, but in fact there is nothing you want to photpgraph.The only \u2026",
          "The archetecture of the building is amazing, but the Art is not my cup of tea.",
          "Fantastic building and museum. And I'm not even that interested in art. :-)",
          "Amazing beauty that the titanium giant brings to the eyes.  Amazing how everything works in perfect order.The ticket is expensive but worth the inside  visit",
          "Looks better in real life. A must see for anyone that loves architecture.",
          "Whilst perhaps the most obvious place to visit in Bilbao, there is much to see and do in and around the museum which you\u2019ll likely not expect.  The exterior is visually striking and was an immediate draw for our young children with \u2026",
          "Nice place nice city one must visit to this city..",
          "Great building but disapointing inside one floor 2 was closed and very limited modern art to view. Still a must do in Bilbao",
          "This is my third visit: Amazing building, worth the visit alone.  Love the permanent exhibits, but haven't enjoyed the temporary expositions as much as on my first visit 5 years ago.",
          "It's a beautiful building a work of art even. The experience in side is nice, but I feel you really have to love modern art to appreciate it. A year or two ago I went in for free and even then I felt cheated. That said I went at other times and felt the art was breathtaking.",
          "Very nice and impressive. Building and art!",
          "An interesting museum especially the displays of more famous artists on the 3rd floor and the giant steel sculptures on the ground floor.  But much of the fun in the Guggenheim is seeing the building itself from both inside and out\nIf you \u2026",
          "Astounding building with a fantastic variety of permanent exhibits, masterpieces, and temporary exhibitions. Highly recommend David Serra's installation on the ground floor.",
          "Spectacular,  interesting. The exterior much better than the interior.",
          "Charming, great balance among art, architecture and atmosphere!",
          "Beautiful building.  Collection not so much.  The building is the thing.",
          "Really nice museum but check whose exhibition is on at the moment. Everytime I go it seems like a complete different museum except for the permanent stuff. The building itself is worth a trip.",
          "Incredible museum, one of the best of Spain",
          "Let yourself be enchanted by a fantastic world of modern art. It's amazing. It's an adventure. My favorite is the big metal spider in front of the museum.",
          "I like the building the best. Have a good look outside. Had a pleasant lunch in the cafe. Cafeteria was \u20ac30 for menu of the day!",
          "SUCH a beautiful structure. Visiting during the day and also sunset time. View on the bridge is best for photos.\n\nInside was also wonderful, and worth a few hours!",
          "Extremely well kept museum with great American artist really enjoyed all the exhibits and the different types of art that was broadcast.  Don\u2019t skip this place if you are coming to Bilbao.",
          "It's only a bad thing you can't take photos. Building is nice, art too.",
          "The building itself is magnificent but the inside is lacking in content.",
          "Amazing building! Excellent lay out of galleries and exhibits, some are important, but not all of them so great.",
          "Fantastic building. The architecture by Frank Gehry certainly wins out over most of the art inside. Bourgeois's giant spider \"Maman\" and Jeff Koons' tulips and flower bedecked \"Puppy\" outside are memorable, however.",
          "Really loved the building which came up to expectations and the position on the waterfront.  However, art is in the eye of the beholder!!",
          "Great artwork and architecture. Interesting exhibitions and a beautiful building. Worth a visit!",
          "Amazing architecture. However, having been to many museums globally, the exhibits felt lackluster and without sparks of modern inspiration. Guggenheim Bilbao needs Marie Kondo.",
          "Very disappointed, half of the exhibits were closed so how they can still charge for entry when this is the case I don\u2019t know.  The building is spectacular but even the exhibits that were open I found lacklustre and quite boring!",
          "I visited for the fist time when I was 12. Now I am 25 and I can tell you that you appreciate more things when youre older. Its a family friendly space, wheelchair accessible, with elevators, the a/c is nice. Security very tight but nice. \u2026",
          "Wow wow wow... Both inside and out. Simply stunning. The building actually physically effects you. The exhibitions are a bonus!",
          "Great museum! Lovely building nice artwork",
          "Interesting museum of different kinds of art",
          "No trip to Bilbao can be complete without a visit to the Guggenheim Museum. What an amazing place - a work of art housing works of art! Absolutely unmissable!",
          "Brilliant building - some great exhibitions!",
          "Great architecture and a beautiful place on a sunny day outside as well.",
          "17 eur is overpriced taken the expositions. Building is much better than anything inside unfortunately.\nLast but not least, not allowing to take pictures of works of art is so outdated for a contemporary museum, guys wake up!!! Instagram, social media and just remembering what one saw!",
          "Best modern art museum ever! Really amazing to see, it's definitely a bucket list item to check off.",
          "My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day has been ruined. Some \"art\" works looked like paint messes made by 2 year olds. There were slashed canvasses, nothing on them but a slash, and the accompanying explanations did nothing to add to \u2026",
          "This a one of a must-see in Bilbao in term of art. The price is around 18 euros but if you're eligible for discount, then price could be half. Audioguide is already included in ticket. Inside, there are numerous exhibitions of printings, \u2026",
          "If you're in Bilbao, you're already going here. You'd be crazy not to! The design is unique and there is plenty to do and see even from the outside. The permanent exhibitions are amazing and the temporary exhibitions keep things fresh (I've \u2026",
          "At my time of visit the building was more interesting than the art and displays itself.",
          "Amazing for museum enthusiasts and regular patrons alike. The current Jenny Holzer exhibit is breathtaking!",
          "Museum was quite expensive and, for the price, there are far better places to see.  However, it IS a major attraction and there are a few things worth seeing inside.  The price is 16\u20ac per person and there are 3 floors of things to see.  However, content on each floor is minimal and you will be done rather quickly.",
          "Inside not impessive a lot of modern art but honestly not for me.\nArchitecture of building is special and Nice. Ik would not go in again outside part is th\u00e9 best",
          "Unfortunately I didn't have time to go inside, but just the outside already worth's it. Beautiful architecture from the Canadian Frank Gehry",
          "Just the architecture itself is amazing. This is like Meka for everyone interested / related to contemporary art.",
          "Incredible architecture! The art inside the museum varies from interesting to questionable.",
          "Beautiful and astonishing! Definitely must-be for anyone visiting Bilbao. Creative and funny. Let's you spend at least two hours wandering around great pieces of art made by fantastic and passionate artists. Surely a nice place to start or end any trip!",
          "Great building from outside with views on inside; didn't view the collections as didn't have time.",
          "Worth a visit even if all modern art is not your thing!",
          "As stunning in real life as you imagine it would be. Not as spectacular from the inside but 100% worth a visit",
          "What a fabulous building this is. The centre of Bilbao is lovely and clean with great restaurants (especially good are the Pinxtos). If you are looking for a city break Bilbao will NOT dissapoint and a visit to the Guggenheim is a must!",
          "Great visit...busy as you would expect. Worth buying a ticket in advance online to avoid very long que ue.",
          "So-so exhibits but \u00fcber rude staff.",
          "Building lovely but contents poor",
          "Fantastic architecture, with some great artists. However authoritarian staff were rude and patronising, detracting from what may otherwise have been a pleasant experience.",
          "Permanent collection on view is quite small, and the building is not that impressive. If you're lucky there's an interesting temporary exhibition, but for us there wasn't (the Giacometti show on the second floor was recently closed). The no-photography policy is stupid.",
          "If you come with small children, the playground next to it is also great to spend the afternoon! And dont miss out the ice cream in front of it!",
          "The building was incredible however the artwork left me wondering what was the big deal. Probably just me",
          "Unique experience, celebration of art, culture, design and architecture. Must see. And has a superb bistro for lunch.",
          "A must see when you are interested in contemporary art",
          "Well folks. If you're traveling through, do yourself a favor and check out this fantastic piece of architecture! Frank Gehry is someone who pushes the boundaries with regards to materiality, form, and of course (lack of) function! Although \u2026",
          "Museum in the front and absolutely astonishing... great use of space, hundreds of photos taken outside but not so sure if I was equally impressed inside. One floor out of use due to exhibition changes, not told when buying tickets but got a \u2026",
          "A very nice place and building to visit. The entrance is not that expansive and although not all the modern art makes sens to me, in most rooms there is some written text to explain the basic ideas of the artist. The only downside is that \u2026",
          "Interesting building, worth a visit, still prefer old style museums",
          "Excellent Museum with a wonderful art collection. Worth a look just for the architecture.",
          "The building itself is the best part of the museum",
          "Very interesting building, well worth the visit and excellent value at 10 euros",
          "Incredible museum, no words for it. You may think that it's only worth having a look at it from the outside, but you'd be completely wrong. Inside, there are numerous exhibitions which will blow your mind",
          "The building is a masterpiece. You have to visit it even if you do not like the art. Tickets are quite expensive. There are two restaurants inside and both offer Basque dishes.",
          "Second visit. A phenomenal place. The building and grounds are works of art. Their bistro has a nice selection of pinxos.",
          "Very nice. Takes about 3 hours or more to see all",
          "The shape outside is amazing and the collections change from time to time",
          "Outside building was amazing. \n\nThe so called exhibitions were absolutely terrible. If you want to be exposed to leftwing propaganda and amatuer drawings then go. Otherwise  Save your money look from the outside. Very very disappointing",
          "Magnificant building, inside and out. Only \u20ac10 for adult ticket.",
          "Absolutely breathtaking, loved the museum. I visited this place couple of years ago when they had audio/visual exhibition as well as the art gems.  Really interesting place, I enjoyed it and would recommend it. I'mIgoing back this year and really looking forward to seeing it again.",
          "Beautiful from the outside, enter only if you are an art lover",
          "I'll rate it five stars just for the exterior. Make sure to check out the mural painting under the bridge next to it as well!",
          "Both of the Guggenheim museums are very interesting and always have very impactful exhibits. There were some very intense exhibits and it was definitely very emotional but so worth the visit.",
          "I will definitely visit it again",
          "Interesting architecture. Lots going on inside and outside. Puppy looks great. Not sure about the spider. Didn't have time to explore inside much.",
          "It's an awesome museum, If you are around Bilbao, I strongly suggest to visit it",
          "Absolutely must see when you be in Bilbao. This place is awesome \ud83d\ude0e",
          "Beautiful museum! You don't even need to go inside to enjoy the experience.",
          "Awesome museum. We loved the architecture and big expositions. Smaller than we thought.",
          "It's a really pretty and different museum (really impressive from the outside)",
          "The iron work of Serra was stunning, the Morandi was boring, the Fontana was a purile joke repeated excessively. The puppy could make you laugh and hopefully, you will find something that will make you cry. For me it was the other Kiefer.",
          "The building is great and inspring but the artworks inside are just... too much modern. Very hard to grasp.",
          "As great as it's reputation",
          "Nice building and walk while limited number of art to see",
          "Never been inside but what a sight to see from outside. I love it cause of Dan Brown's novel titled Origin. I also love Bilbao, Spain",
          "Great (I mean amazing) space, top class modern artists. Perhaps I'm spoilt by the Tate in London but maybe not all the works are their greatest. But the building (and the works in the surrounding outside spaces) are knockout so make up for any of my carping criticism. Go there and enjoy!",
          "A fabulous building definitely worth visiting. Although a little sad to see the sparsity of artwork inside",
          "It's just awesome. The buildings are out of the world",
          "Beautiful structure.  The exhibits we saw were just amazing.  The special Jenny Holzer exhibition is a must see. Apparently,  American gate keepers are too fragile to view the truth. This work needs desperately to travel to the US.",
          "Amazing museum in Bilbao by the river. Inside of the museum there are many exhibitions as well as at garden of the museum. Enjoy the garden and the park around it. You can arrive there by taking the tram from the central bus station (the airport buses are heading to bus station as well).",
          "Outside more beautiful than the inside",
          "Outside & inside. Amazing building & art exhibition",
          "Well worth a visit if you're in the area. Breathtaking architecture and some really interesting installations. Free cloakroom and friendly staff.",
          "Amazing! Great artwork and well laid out. I do think that the artwork was very spread out, each gallery was a bit of a distance to the next one.",
          "A must when in Bilbao. Buy your ticket a day ahead or on internet and skip the long lines. Just the building inside and out is worthwhile. Permanent exhibition of Richard Serra's huge sculpture is impressive.  Exhibitions from the \u2026",
          "Great building which is per se the main reason to visit it. The exhibitions are only an extra...",
          "Amazing art and architecture but it\u2019s a shame it had to be in such a boring city",
          "Great museum with lots to see, worth the cost, even though it\u2019s a bit expensive, be careful not to take phots of the art, they get annoyed by that even though all of the art (copies) are available at the shop and on the internet, \n\nThe titanium cladding looked quite impressive and the building itself is quite unique",
          "Hello Guggenheim Bilbao Museum, \n\nthank you so much for today's visit (21.7.19) which never take place due to your \u201eclever\u201c security.\n\nI\u2019m doing the Camino and I\u2019m walking barefoot. Actually, I've been walking barefoot for 9 years, let\u2019s \u2026",

          "Nice architecture, but exhibition were not very interesting as we expected a bit more for the high entrance fee.",
          "Just amazing. Even in my sleep deprived state there was art for every taste and the audio guide was so easy to follow. Free cloakroom for baggage.",
          "If you like modern/contemporary arts then it is s must",
          "Is a big museum with not much to see",
          "You need local guide for effective tour",
          "It's big and shiny with enough inside to cater for a range of tastes. Come at the wrong (late morning?) time and you can be caught out by the queue so plan carefully",
          "You either love modern or you don't. Or... You are open to it. I loved the Guggenheim Bilbao. Beautiful building,  great art, take an audio guide, its free and in many langages, it explains everything. Check the temporary exhibitions as \u2026",
          "Extremely beautiful location, very interesting building, polite personnel.",
          "The building is truly breathtaking and a piece of art by itself. The collection however was a big let-down.",
          "Good place to visit for connoisseurs of contemporary art.",
          "The construction is impressive both from the outside and in. The artwork outside as well. The artwork inside I'm not an expert on but I was bored numb",
          "The Guggenheim alone makes Bibao worth the visit, let alone everything else in this great city.",
          "This museum is more about the architecture than the contents. The building and setting is the star. The actual art displays while worth seeing while you are there don't expect anything outstanding.",
          "The building itself is really a one of a kind building. Inside or outside, no matter where you look, you'll always see something different. The expositions themselves were nice and positioned nicely inside the building. The building itself \u2026",
          "The exterior is nice but the interior is really a waste of time",
          "I enjoyed the building as much as the exhibits, some thought provoking artwork. You can easily spend hours in here so there\u2019s  a cafe & restaurant that you can go to for some refreshments.",
          "It catches the eye when you're nearby and you look at the building and the surrounding sculptures. It is a masterpiece of architecture, a must see place. The exhibits are really unique but for those who like contemporary art.",
          "Breakthrough architecture capable of changing negative society habits and urban planning, converting Bilbao in one of the most interesting Spanish cities for travelers, habitants, and tourists. The museum art contents are varied, with different possibilities to see an array of artists. Brilliant museum!",
          ".Quite an experience.  The outside of the building was spectacular. The inside wasn't what we expected. Some parts of the exibition more interesting than others!!",
          "It's ok but I thought that there would be a lot more of famous modern art",
          "Very fine works of art displayed in proper light. I was on tour with my family and was able to view all three floors. A great place to take the family and get exposed to art. Although I don't agree that all of the works displayed were art.",
          "Amazing building and beautiful environment. Great restaurant inside",
          "Stunning architecture and modern art. Really worth it - inside and outside. Kids under 12 don't pay.",
          "Views from any angle, night or day, are unique",
          "Great! Love the work from Serra over there, a truly impressive experience.",
          "Please spend your time and money visiting the Bilbao Fine Art Museum\n\nOr the Copy museum",
          "Wonderful space. Loved it.",
          "Building is nice. A few pieces of artwork too, but the majority is quite underwhelming. Go to el Prado.",
          "Modern art is a strange thing. Those who admire it will probably like the museum, but for me it was boring. The outside of the museum is super interesting though",
          "I went here mainly for the architecture not the art.\nIt is definitely a part of Bilbao not to be missed. Some of the art was good as well.",
          "Beautyfull museum with stunning expositions in a very interesting town with a magnificent old quarter. Be sure to also visit the Museo de Bellas Artes which is nearby.",
          "How can anyone not be impressed with this Frank Geary designed masterpiece that put Bilbao on the map as a must see destination. \n\nThe galleries are well laid out, plenty of signage through out the building. It is not as strange inside as \u2026",
          "3/5 stars if you go inside... Otherwise 5/5.",
          "One of the best museums I have ever been in... it\u2019s like walking into a sculpture. Beautiful architecture and beautiful works within. Highly recommended! \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Well it's a must visit, not much to explain but to appreciate the architecture outside. Be sure to walk along the river to appreciate the bridge by \nSantiago Calatrava as well.",
          "Cool exhibitions when we visited.",
          "The building looks good from a distance, but when you get there it is not structural but a facade. I wouldn't have wanted any of the exhibits at home. One was intriguing: The artist laid a 3 metre square canvas on the floor, poured paint \u2026",
          "It's a nice big museum with a lot of modern art",
          "I love visiting this musseum.  The exhibitions vary. The best one I've seen was a Kandinsky exhibition - so many different styles of art disciplines. It's a littlle bit expensive. The small shop has a good range of lovely cards and books. Recommended. Building from outside is the best, so you can get the gest for free. ;P",
          "You can get dizzy but still fun",
          "Such a great experience, outside and inside. Architecture of the museum is of course amazing, spider and flower dog so cute. We made a thousand photos and enjoyed so much. There is a nice exhibit and what to see as well. This is a highlight of bilbao city, but the city is quite charming, colofur and lovely. Totally worth visiting.",
          "For me this museum looks abit overhyped. The sortounding atea is really nice, the building inside and outside is really interesting. There was a permanent exhibition at the ground floor, i just really did not understand why they call this \u2026",
          "Fanatically political, expressive and creative. The space and architecture of the building, sculptures and water experience surround is all part of the cultural and educational experience. This is no fuddy duddy museum. A must visit ! Thank you !",
          "Stunning piece of architecture. Loved it but not enough time to explore everything",
          "One of the greatest architectural designs and construction feats of the modern world. This creation of motion, solidity, and wonder is both a canvas and the artistic expression on it drawing on the revealing and suggestive.  The building \u2026",
          "Outside of this building is  breathtakingly beautiful...inside was empty and  suffocating.",
          "Superb architecture and then there's the art!",

          "Big museum, can spend a good one hour or 2 here.",

          "Museum building is wonderful. The exhibitions are somewhat dissapointing.\nHowever if you are into 20th century modern art....... may be.",
          "A superb experience inside and out! When you go, remember to start your visit on the third floor and work your way down, then it makes more sense. And keep an eye out for all the great art pieces in the street around the museum and the blocks surrounding it! A very inspirational place!",
          "Great museum with phenomenal art around the world. Outside has a beautiful walk way were you can see the sculptures and river. Walk up stairs for a great view of the whole museum.",
          "2nd visit. First was amazing. Such a great building. Current exhibitions are fairly tedious, or are not my cup of tea but the built is superb.",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed visit. Buy tickets online to avoid queues. Note that the lift currently only goes between top and bottom floor due to a floor being closed off.",
          "Love the environment. Perfect place to spend quality time alone...",
          "This place is cool and definitely worth a visit if you are ever in Bilbao.",
          "The best art piece you will see  is the building itself. A contenporary architecture's masterpiece.",
          "The building is incredible and we were so happy that they had some installments on the outside as well as a nice gift shop (huge range of English books re. Modern art)...\n\nAs travelers we couldn't afford the entry fee to go in, 16\u20ac/adult :/ \u2026",
          "Amazing museum. Stunning architecture and thought-provoking exhibitions.",
          "Always have enjoyed the art of the building and the very political work currently on exhibit!",
          "Amazing design and out of this world art. Worth walking along the river gazing at the magnificent designs.",
          "Beautiful building and a must see. It\u2019s a great to approach it from the old town (seven streets), alongside the river with its diverse bridges. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to say anything about the exhibitions, as it depends on your preference of art \u2026",
          "I loved this museum ! The exhibits were great but the most famous part is The Matter of Time, and that's for a reason ! A unique and I incredible experience in my opinion",

          "Architectural piece of art! Ingenious, great design and amazing construction.",
          "Even in peak season the gallery managed to stay uncongested and free flowing so all exhibits could be appreciated unrushed. Found the audio guide overly verbose and pretentious.",
          "An amazing experience for all family. It was not too crowded queue for a weekday but always better & quicker to have online ticket scanned from your phone by staff... All pieces were interesting to see, but we had a lot of fun seeing the \u2026",
          "Great place, just to see outside, and walk all along the bilbao ria. I wouldn't go inside unless there is an exhibition that you really want to see. Very expensive and to be honest the building and surrounding area are the best things",
          "Impressive architecture, and impressive art! A must see!",
          "Wow, where do I begin? The architecture of Frank Gehry is simply breath taking. And the artwork outside. Read about Bilbao before going. Check on the Puppy!",

          "Great place to visit!",
          "Located in Bilbao, the largest urban area in Basque Country, the Guggenheim is not to be missed. Frank Gehry\u2019s famous design is astounding and ahead of its time, and what\u2019s inside is a fittingly modern 100,000 square feet of exhibit space. \u2026",
          "Well at the time of our visit there was only 2 floors with exhibitions so not so many to see. It's an amazing building from outside and is well worth a visit. If you are going to visit make sure that the exhibitions are all in as it's quite pricy for its permanent collections only.",
          "A little bit weird museum)",
          "A truly amazing building.  We went during the day but it is worth returning after dusk to see the building and surrounding sculptures lit by the lights.\nVery good value and the audio guides are excellent.  Could have spent longer there, so much to see.  Loved Joanna Vasconcellos works.  Definitely want to go back.",
          "This is a great place to rethink and view things from different angles.",

        "wiki": "The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao is a museum of modern and contemporary art designed by Canadian-American architect Frank Gehry, and located in Bilbao, Basque Country, Spain. The museum was inaugurated on 18 October 1997 by King Juan Carlos I of Spain, with an exhibition of 250 contemporary works of art. Built alongside the Nervion River, which runs through the city of Bilbao to the Cantabrian Sea, it is one of several museums belonging to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation and features permanent and visiting exhibits of works by Spanish and international artists. It is one of the longest museums in Spain.\nOne of the most admired works of contemporary architecture, the building has been hailed as a \"signal moment in the architectural culture\", because it represents \"one of those rare moments when critics, academics, and the general public were all completely united about something\", according to architectural critic Paul Goldberger. The museum was the building most frequently named as one of the  most important works completed since 1980 in the 2010 World Architecture Survey among architecture experts.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1991, the Basque government suggested to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation that it would fund a Guggenheim museum to be built in Bilbao's decrepit port area, once the city's main source of income. The Basque government agreed to cover the US$100 million construction cost, to create a US$50 million acquisitions fund, to pay a one-time US$20 million fee to the Guggenheim and to subsidize the museum's US$12 million annual budget. In exchange, the Foundation agreed to manage the institution, rotate parts of its permanent collection through the Bilbao museum and organize temporary exhibitions.The museum was built by Ferrovial, at a cost of US$89 million.  About 5,000 residents of Bilbao attended a preopening extravaganza outside the museum on the night preceding the official opening, featuring an outdoor light show and concerts. On 18 October 1997 the museum was opened by Juan Carlos I of Spain.\n\n\n== Building ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nThe Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation selected Frank Gehry as the architect, and its director, Thomas Krens, encouraged him to design something daring and innovative.  The curves on the exterior of the building were intended to appear random; the architect said that \"the randomness of the curves are designed to catch the light\". The interior \"is designed around a large, light-filled atrium with views of Bilbao's estuary and the surrounding hills of the Basque country\". The atrium, which Gehry nicknamed The Flower because of its shape, serves as the organizing center of the museum.When the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao opened to the public in 1997, it was immediately hailed as one of the world's most spectacular buildings in the style of Deconstructivism (although Gehry does not associate himself with that architectural movement), a masterpiece of the 20th century. Architect Philip Johnson described it as \"the greatest building of our time\", while critic Calvin Tomkins, in The New Yorker, characterized it as \"a fantastic dream ship of undulating form in a cloak of titanium,\" its brilliantly reflective panels also reminiscent of fish scales. Herbert Muschamp praised its \"mercurial brilliance\" in The New York Times Magazine.  The Independent calls the museum \"an astonishing architectural feat\".\n\nThe museum is seamlessly integrated into the urban context, unfolding its interconnecting shapes of stone, glass and titanium on a 32,500-square-meter (350,000 sq ft) site along the Nervi\u00f3n River in the ancient industrial heart of the city; while modest from street level, it is most impressive when viewed from the river. With a total 24,000 m2 (260,000 sq ft), of which 11,000 m2 (120,000 sq ft) are dedicated to exhibition space, it had more exhibition space than the three Guggenheim collections in New York and Venice combined at that time. The 11,000 m2 of exhibition space are distributed over nineteen galleries, ten of which follow a classic orthogonal plan that can be identified from the exterior by their stone finishes. The remaining nine galleries are irregularly shaped and can be identified from the outside by their swirling organic forms and titanium cladding.  The largest gallery measures 30 meters wide and 130 meters long (98 ft \u00d7 427 ft). In 2005, it housed Richard Serra's monumental installation The Matter of Time, which Robert Hughes dubbed \"courageous and sublime\".The building was constructed on time and budget, which is rare for architecture of this type. In an interview in Harvard Design Magazine, Gehry explained how he did it. First, he ensured that what he calls the \"organization of the artist\" prevailed during construction, to prevent political and business interests from interfering with the design. Second, he made sure he had a detailed and realistic cost estimate before proceeding. Third, he used computer visualizations produced by Rick Smith employing Dassault Systemes' CATIA V3 software and collaborated closely with the individual building trades to control costs during construction.\nKLM Royal Dutch Airlines donated $1,000,000 towards its construction.\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nThis museum is a colossal construction, which used more than 25,000 tons of concrete, or 10,000 cubic meters, that is why it requires deep and solid foundations. The foundation was laid on reinforced concrete piles driven into the bedrock at an average depth of 14 meters.The building is based in the clay of the bed of the nearby river \u201cRia de Bilbao\u201d; therefore, it was necessary to implant piles in large numbers, driven into the ground by many boring machines. In total, 665 pilings were driven to anchor the building to the ground.\n\n\n=== Cladding ===\nThe base of the building is covered with beige limestone from the Hu\u00e9scar quarries near Granada, cut from 5 cm thick slabs. The building is clear thanks to the walls, specially treated to protect the interior from the effects of the sun. The glass of the windows has also been treated to prevent light from damaging the exposed pieces.\nIt is clad in titanium plates, arranged in scales, on a galvanized steel structure. The Museum's exterior skin is made of 33,000 titanium plates, a material that has been used to replace copper or lead because of their toxicity. Many tests have been carried out with different materials to find one that would withstand heat and bad weather, while maintaining its character. It was during this research process that tests were started on titanium samples and the best treatment was found.\nIts lamination process is delicate and has to be done in places with high energy sources, that's why the laminated parts were made in Pittsburgh, in the United States, the rolling allowed to obtain titanium plates only 0.4mm thick, which is much thinner than if we had to use steel plates. Moreover, titanium is about half the weight of steel, indeed, the museum's titanium coating represents only 60 tons.\nDuring the conception, the pieces were designed to resist the bad weather, that is why a quilted rather than undulated shape was privileged, to resist the wind, and to avoid vibrations during storms.\nTitanium is a low-polluting material, and each part has been designed differently according to its orientation on the building, so they correspond perfectly with the curves desired by Frank Gehry.\n\n\n== Virtual Building ==\nIn the fall of 1993, architects at Gehry Partners began to utilize Dassault Systemes' CATIA software for the schematic design phase of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao to digitize and model the exterior of the Museum project. Essentially, this software calculates point by point the stresses to which materials are subjected, by generating a 3D model showing the different tensions and allowing the values of many structural elements of the museum to be calculated: the steel structure, titanium cladding or foundations, among others. It also helped to automate the cutting of materials such as stone or titanium plates.\nThe architects applied Master Modeling and Virtual Build Processes they learned from Rick Smith and his use of the same techniques on the Walt Disney Concert Hall during the previous two years. The success and global awareness of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao ushered in a new era of Virtual Building and was a catalyst for what would become popularly known as Building Information Modeling seven years later.\nPulitzer prize winning architectural critic Paul Goldberger shares the words of others that Bilbao \"could not have been constructed without CATIA\". He further relays that Bilbao \"was the first building for which CATIA played a role in almost every aspect of the design and construction process\".\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nThe museum notably houses \"large-scale, site-specific works and installations by contemporary artists\", such as Richard Serra's 100-meter-long (340 ft) Snake, and displays the work of Basque artists, \"as well as housing a selection of works\" from the Foundation's modern art collection.  In 1997, the museum opened with \"The Guggenheim Museums and the Art of This Century\", a 300-piece overview of 20th-century art from Cubism to new media art. Most pieces came from the Guggenheim's permanent collection, but the museum also acquired paintings by Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still and commissioned new works by Francesco Clemente, Anselm Kiefer, Jenny Holzer and Richard Serra.The exhibitions change often; the museum generally hosts thematic exhibitions, centered for example on Chinese or Russian art.  Traditional paintings and sculptures are a minority compared to installations and electronic forms.  The highlight of the collection, and its only permanent exhibit, is The Matter of Time (incorporating an earlier work, Snake), a series of weathering steel sculptures designed by Serra, which is housed in the 130-meter Arcelor Gallery (formerly known as the Fish Gallery but renamed in 2005 for the steel manufacturer that sponsored the project).  The collections usually highlight Avant-garde art, 20th century abstraction, and non-objective art.  When the museum announced the 2011 exhibition \"The Luminous Interval\", a show of artwork belonging to Greek businessman Dimitris Daskalopoulos, who is also a museum trustee, this met with criticism of, among other things, too much curatorial power for a serious benefactor. In 2005, Olivier Berggruen and Ingrid Pfeiffer curated a retrospective of Yves Klein.\nIn 2012 David Hockney's exhibition  drew over 290,000 visitors to the museum.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economic and media impact ==\nThe museum was opened as part of a revitalization effort for the city of Bilbao. Almost immediately after its opening, the Guggenheim Bilbao became a popular tourist attraction, drawing visitors from around the globe. In its first three years, almost 4 million tourists visited the museum, helping to generate about \u20ac500 million in economic activity. The regional council estimated that the money visitors spent on hotels, restaurants, shops and transport allowed it to collect \u20ac100 million in taxes, which more than paid for the building cost.\n\nThe building was featured in the 1999 James Bond film The World Is Not Enough in the pre-title sequence and the Tamil film Sivaji (2007), in which it is the setting for the music video of the song \"Style\", composed by A. R. Rahman.  Mariah Carey's music video \"Sweetheart\", directed by Hype Williams, shows singers Jermaine Dupri and Carey in various locations at the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nThe so-called \"Bilbao effect\" refers to how the museum transformed the city. The term, however, has also been employed by critics who have denounced the museum as a symbol of gentrification and cultural imperialism. The Wall Street Journal suggested that the Bilbao effect should be called the Bilbao anomaly, \"for the iconic chemistry between the design of building, its image and the public turns out to be rather rare.\"Art critic Brian O'Doherty was positive about approaching the building but criticized the museum's interior effect, saying \"[O]nce you get indoors things are a little different. Even the so-called site-specific works didn't look too happy to me. Most of the interior spaces are too vast.\" He went on to describe how works by Braque, Picasso and Rodchenko \"looked absurd\" and tiny on the museum's walls.\n\n\n== Management and 2007 embezzlement incident ==\nAccording to a report issued in 2007 by the Basque Court of Auditors, the museum paid more than US$27 million for the acquisition of art between 2002 and 2005, including Serra's The Matter of Time for the cavernous ground-floor gallery. After another audit in 2008 revealed that money was missing from accounts, the Foundation said that it filed a case against the director, Roberto Cearsolo Barrenetxea, \"for financial and accounting irregularities\", asserting that he had admitted diverting money from two companies that manage the Guggenheim Bilbao building and its art collection to his own account since 1998.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nWorld Architecture Survey\n12 Treasures of Spain\nGuggenheim family\nThe Globalized City, a publication doing case studies on the museum as a large scale development project\nList of Guggenheim Museums\n\n\n== References ==\n\nCuito, Aurora, Pons, Eugeni, Guggenheim, 2001.\nGuggenheim Bilbao, 2000, Connaissance des Arts (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Promotion Artistique) ; no. especial.\nSullivan, Edward J, Calvo Serraller, Francisco, Hunter, Sam, Forma eta figurazioa : Blake-Purnell bildumako maisu-lanak : [erakusketa, Guggenheim Bilbao Museoa], Museo Guggenheim Bilbao, 1998.\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nScholars on Bilbao - academic works that analyse Bilbao's urban regeneration\nGuggenheim Museum Bilbao - Project for Public Spaces Hall of Shame\nPictures of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao\nGuggenheim Museum in an artistic short movie\nBilbao.

          "Never a fan of anything Jeff Koons, a vastly overrated self-promoting poseur, has done, the Puppy is just plain silly. The sculptures by Louise Bourgeois and Anish Kapoor are far more interesting.",
          "It's totally worth it. Plus, you're sure to be in the neighborhood to visit the Guggenheim. Puppy form/outline covered in live flowering plants.",
          "A huge puppy created by Jeff Koons, who also has the sculpture, \"Tulips,\" also on the museum grounds. We were there in July and Puppy was decked out in an assortment of colorful flowers. It is huge and everyone clamorous to get their photo taken in front of it. We saw them",
          "This is a living statue is made out of flowers and it is in front the the Guggenheim Museum, they change the plants 2 times a year. I have never seen anything like this before.",
          "i don't know who dreamded this up, but its a wonderufl original concept. our 5 yr old son really loved the puppy. we spent the entire day in the Guggenheim area. mostly at the nearby playground. The puppy was a capstone to a nice day spent at the Guggenheim museum.",
          "You have to see the giant puppy plant display when in Bilbao. As you approach the Gugghenheim it's the biggest thing you see out there other than the museum. Bright pops of colour from this living plant mascot. And did I say...it's HUGE!!!",
          "Well your flowerplants home maybe looks Nice but this beat most everyone! Colorful, high, nice and ofcource you need to take photos!",
          "A puppy is a puppy, but this is a very nice one. Just \"above\" Guggenheim Museum. A symbol of this special city.",
          "Beautiful and colorful flower arrangement that is much bigger than I expected. Our small children loved this more than the Guggenheim museum. I would like to see how it has been built. Lovely!",
          "This famous \"Dog\"sits in front of the Guggenheim museum. Its the most photographed dog in the world? Maybe.... But its a must see!",
          "Situated in front of the Guggenhein museum, very colorfull and perfect for taling a selfie \ud83d\ude0a. The object fits the rest of the museum and is a good start for visiting the Guggeheim museum.",
          "The puppy is located on the Guggenheim property. It's basically a walk by and picture opportunity. It's made up of living flowers. If anyone's seen any of Jeff Koon's other living sculptures, you'll enjoy it. It's a pretty juxtaposition to the modern museum. It's free.",
          "A really cool art work definitely worth stopping by at - which you would almost certainly do anyway as it's outside the Guggenheim!",
          "It\u2019s a great big flower dog, outside the museum. I took my selfie and moved on. Are there really not any more memorable places to visit?",
          "The flowers are real. The puppy is not. Nevertheless, it's a beautiful sight to behold, even for Cherry Wonderdog.",
          "What an amazing sight to behold. You really have to see it to get the full experience. It is huge and absolutely beautiful. We saw it in the summer, so the colors just popped all over. We enjoyed walking around outside the musuem to see the other sculptures. A MUST SEE!",
          "One thing I notice in the Basque region is that people love their dogs and that dogs are happy, free and well behaved. Puppy to me is both homage to the indisputable and unlimited love of dogs, but also flowers and joy. I could sit and gaze lovingly at Puppy for hours and in",
          "I did not know that \"there was a puppy,\" and so I was so delighted. See it both up close and from far away to appreciate.",
          "Jeff Koons 'Puppy' has become one of the icons of the regeneration of Bilbao, standing guard to the entrance of the Guggenheim Museum. The 43 ft high West Highland Terrier is created using a variety of colourful flowers and plants, creating a unique topiary sculpture. Enjoy,",
          "It is a classic picture opportunity. It was extremely colorful and who knew so many birds called puppy home. When you think Guggenheim this is what you picture.",
          "A spectacular piece of art with a huge selection of flowers. The birds and bees were also in awe! A must see sculpture near the entrance to the Guggenheim.",
          "What a great little spot to stop and take some fun pictures. We didn't have time to visit the museum, so we just had fun wandering around the Guggenheim grounds. Love it!",
          "If you are in Bilbao and do not take the time to see the Puppy you are making a big mistake. Live flowers make up the Puppy's \"fur.\" I have no idea how they maintain it and make it look so good, but I appreciate the fact that they do and it exists.",
          "I first learned of 'Puppy' when I read Dan Brown's book, 'Origin'. He described this endearing sculpture as a bear. When I visited the Guggenheim Museum where it sits outside, I heard people refer to it as 'Puppy'. I conclude that the people of Bilbao know best so I am happy to",
          "I came across this puppy during my early morning walks in Bilbao. I was amazed to see this huge thing which when I saw it had flowers. What an amazing feat. And I love it how the locals call it as Poo-Pi. Super-cute, you have not seen Bilbao if you did not get stand in",
          "Definitely worth a visit, the puppy invites you into the Guggenheim. It\u2019s huge and you can\u2019t miss it. We n line with the Jeff Koons\u2019 flowers, it\u2019s fresh and fun and a great landmark",
          "Hey -it\u2019s free, it\u2019s pretty, you can take nice photos around it. Flowers, dogs, people watching. Did I mention free?",
          "Right by the Guggenheim, the puppy sculpture has become an iconic emblem of Bilbao. Very colourful. Photographic favourite",
          "This statue is in front of teh Gugenheim and is now a landmark in this city. Well taken care of. Worth many photographs",
          "I think they\u2019ve always got a flower display out there, really a treat due to the wonderful colors. Back drop isn\u2019t bad either...",
          "Wonderful site, bright colours and different flowers beautifully displayed.Set out side the Guggenheim Museum, this is a work of art.",
          "No need to buy a ticket to the Guggenheim; just stop outside and visit puppy. Huge, cheery and well-trained!",
          "\u2018The puppy\u2019 is a true artwork, by Jeff Koons, and a great first impression of what the Guggenheim has to offer. This statue is free to visit, since it stands in front of the museum. Trying to snap a picture without people on it is a challenge, since it is a very photogenic spot.",
          "Iconic statue. Very Impressive. Was hard to get a good photo as there are lots of people trying to do the same.",
          "Got to see this attraction today. Very impressed with size and colorful flowers. Nice to see the Puppy in person.",
          "Great Flower Puppy! Loads of colorful flowers are integrated into the piece. We took pics here to show our family. It guards the entrance to the Guggenheim museum! Wonderful!",
          "Worth seeing but be warned it is closed with scaffolding on it for 10 days twice a year - May and October for re-planting. It was closed 12-22 may 2019.",
          "We lost to see Puppy in Bilbao as it is under renovation twice a year so in may and october you may see only tarpaulin. We were dissapointed.",
          "Twice a year the large dog sculpture by Jeff Koons in front of the Guggenheim needs a change of coat. The flowers attached to the elaborate metal mesh are real and watered by a complicated built in system. It takes 20 persons 9 days to change and secure all the flower pots on",
          "An adoreable little/big puppy just outside the Guggenheim museum. A truely Amazing piece of work. Just stop and admire.",
          "Really quite interesting, and just outside the Guggenheim and you can't miss it. Everyone seems to want their picture taken in front or beside the puppy which is a great photo op and gives you great perspective on big it really is.",
          "This is definitely one of the nicest exhibits at the Guggenheim museum. Assuming I went on an ordinary day, they were busy removing the deadheads from the flowers and replacing others, to keep it looking pristine. A brilliant photo opportunity.",
          "On a recetn visit to Northern SPain we decided to visit Bilbao on the way back home via Bilbao airport. The floral arrangement shaped like a puppy outside the Guggenheim museumm is a sight to behold. It is original and very beautiful and worth going to see.",
          "The flowers you see will depend on the season. Look for how they keep them looking so fresh. It is big and everybody likes to have their photo taken with it.",
          "Sat close to the museum this large, flowery dog stands out from a distance. Pretty cool and well maintained. Nice to look at but not something to spend lots of time looking at.",
          "Lovely flowers in the shape of a dog. Well, I'm more of a cat-woman myself, but it's pretty to look at.",
          "Very close to the Guggenheim so difficult to miss. Absolutely fantastic! The puppy is basically a giant living statue! Even birds seem to have nested amongst the flowers!",
          "We had not read about Jeff Koons' Puppy in the guidebook, so it was great fun to come across it by chance when we were heading into the Guggenheim Museum. The Puppy was covered in colorful flowers at the time we visited. It's really huge and one can't help but break into a",
          "Huge and amazing sculpture overlooking the Guggenheim, full of beautiful living flowering plants. Never seen anything quite like it. Great picture opportunities here.",
          "Everyone who sees it seems to want their photo with this rather large puppy. The puppy changes with seasons because it is covered with flowers. When in Bilbao, take a look.",
          "Jeff Koon\u2019s puppy is a stunning piece of modern art. It\u2019s massive and - so I understand - has a different look according to the seasons. What a wonderful, whimsical art work.",
          "This meant to be ephemeral object is still outside the Guggenheim apparently due to popular requests. It looked freshly planted when we saw it.",
          "Jeff Koons designed this piece of art to make the viewer feel happy, and for me it does exactly that. A giant dog made of beautifully coloured flowers, this work is impossible not to love and understand. What makes it extra special is that the flowers are very real, so the puppy",
          "Visited in Summer. Huge puppy in full colorful bloom in front of musuem. For sure an attraction for many.",
          "As long as you are at the Guggenheim you have to see this puppy covered with flowers. Beautiful seeing",
          "This shouldn't be your reason for visiting the Guggenheim, but it's an amusing distraction for a few minutes. As a photographic subject you'll probably have to wait for all the possible combination of tourists to have their photograph taken in front of it. So boring.",
          "At first, I thought this was a bear, until I heard the tour guide of a group of tourists say that it was a puppy. It is a giant green - that eventually becomes flowery - statue \"gurading\" the Guggenheim, and very instagrammable. You should at least see this puppy when you visit",
          "The \u2018puppy\u2019 stands outside the Guggenheim, so it attracts a lot of attention. From some angles it\u2019s quite difficult to identify as a puppy but as vertical gardens go, it\u2019s still an impressive sight.",
          "I equate this whimsical giant sculpture of a puppy covered in flowering plants with the Guggenheim In Bilbao as much as I do Frank Gehry, the museum\u2019s architect. The 43-feet-tall West Highland Terrier displays thousands and thousands of multicolored blooms as it appears to stand",
          "It's an enormous flowery dog so can't really justify giving it a 5. It's right outside the Guggenheim and a great photo opportunity, but that's about it."

          "We walked through the park on our way to the old town. It was a gray and drizzly morning, but somehow it did not matter. The park still had a certain charm and beauty. I could imagine how more beautiful it is on a bright sunny day. We were almost the only people wandering in the",

        "wiki": "The Artxanda Funicular (Basque: Artxandako Funikularra; Spanish: Funicular de Artxanda) is a funicular railway in the city of Bilbao in Spain's Basque Country. It links downtown Bilbao with the recreational area at the summit of the nearby Artxanda Mountain, which has a park, several restaurants, a hotel, a sports complex, and offers panoramic views of the city.\n\n\n== History ==\nA Cable railway to the top of the Artxanda mountain was first proposed in 1901, but not built due to lack of finance. The current funicular was opened in 1915. During the Spanish Civil War the funicular was damaged by bombing, but reopened in 1938. The funicular closed in 1976 after an accident that injured several employees of the operating company, and did not reopen again until April 1983. The line was closed again in August of the same year, as a result of flood damage, and did not reopen until November.\n\n\n== Operation ==\nThe Bilbao departure point of the funicular is just north of Zubizuri bridge, on the right bank of the River Nervion, within walking distance of the Guggenheim Museum. Services run every 15 minutes throughout the day. Tickets can be bought at the stations, or the Barik card can be used.In 2005 the total number of passengers carried by the Artxanda Funicular was 453,000, a 5% increase on the previous year. The funicular is run by the Funicular de Artxanda S.A., a company wholly owned by the Municipality of Bilbao.\n\n\n== Technical parameters ==\nThe funicular has the following technical parameters:\nLength: 770.34 meters\nHeight: 226.49 meters\nMaximum steepness: 44,98 %\nCapacity: 70 people per car\nTrip time: 3 minutes\nMaximum speed: 5 metres per second\nConfiguration: Single track with passing loop\nTraction: Electricity\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArtxanda Funicular web site (in English)",

          "Whether you go up at the start of your visit to Bilbao to get your bearings or at the end to reminisce, you will enjoy the spectacular views of the old and new towns, the river and the Guggenheim, the airport and the football stadium from the 360 degree garden viewing areas",
          "Had a great time riding on the funicular for great views of Bilbao. The cars and stations were clean and bright. My wife was reluctant to go at first (a little scared), but really enjoyed it.",
          "Worth a visit especially if you enjoy funiculars and views. It\u2019s only \u20ac4.30 for a return ticket so well worth it but once you reach the top there\u2019s not much to do apart from admire the view and return.",
          "We had one day in Bilbao and Artxanda was top of my list. Google maps threw me right off and we had sort of given up on the idea of it, until we strolled to the Guggenheim and saw a sign for the funicular. We followed it and thank god we did. Absolutely gorgeous views from the",
          "The Funicular de Artxanda itself is quite boring and does not offer such great experience as it is typically crowded in the carts. However, the top of Mount Artxanda is amazing and offers great views of Bilbao! The funicular is just a very convenient way to access the Mountain",
          "The views from the top are quite spectacular however there is nothing else to do at the top, even getting a drink was not easy!",
          "Definitely take this funicular to access stunning views of the city from a panoramic viewing point. Option to buy single ticket and walk down steep path to enjoy the beautiful views. Path is quite slippy at times with gravel underfoot. Had a glass of wine at cafe on top of hill.",
          "This is a great way to see Bilbao from the top of the hills surrounding the city. It's also a lot of fun, traveling up the side of the hills before topping out at the summit. A nice park at the top to walk around, and the breathtaking scene from the viewing points. Not",
          "This funicular is incredibly long and steep with fabulous view of the city at top. Quite a feat to build this at the time, over 100 years ago. This is a real bargain so don't miss it Was disappointed the restaurant wasn't open but then it's off season.",
          "A great opportunity to see Bilbao from the top of a mountain. The service runs every 15 mins , which in colder months is enough. Since our last visit the prices have risen considerably it\u2019s now \u20ac4.30 return , it was less than \u20ac1 a year ago. There is a restaurant and a small",
          "Very few people take the trip to the top of the mountain to get a great view of Bilbao, which is a pity. The park is easy to walk around and very peaceful. Highly recommended. The funicular itself is no different than those in Rio or Bergen, though.",
          "We went up just before sunset. The park is a brilliant place to watch the city shift from practical day to social night. Inexpensive. Follow the sigs, it's not easy to stumble on accidentally. There's a small, very tasty, family run bar on the corner of the square at the bottom,",
          "We had to ask for directions to the funicular but it was well worth the trouble. We used our Barik transport cards which makes it cheaper. The view is very good and you can walk back down the mountain if your feeling energetic.",
          "It\u2019s pretty good value at just over \u20ac3 and the views are very good when you get there but there is nothing much else there other than a restaurant",
          "this funicular brings you to the mountain looking down on the city of bilboa , and at \u20ac3.60 return it a very cheap way to see the city .",
          "Views of Bilbao amazing on Mount Artxanda. Take this transportation to reach the downtown of Bilbao.",
          "The funicular was conveniently located behind our hotel and we took the opportunity to go up and get gorgeous views of Bilbao. Highly recommended!",
          "the funicular runs regularly and is located a few minutes walk from the river. The views of Bilbao are spectacular and allows you to see all the main city buildings form a different perpective. If you buy the public transport tourist card the funicular fare is included",
          "The journey up and down the Funicular was fun. Great views of a lovely city, well worth the cheap return fare. Lovely park area at the top, lots of benches to sit on. We spent about an hour at the top taking in the views.",
          "Interesting and quick way to get to the top and catch some nice panoramic views of Bilbao. At Artxanda there is a memorial to the victims of the civil war and a small park where one can spend some time when the weather is good. However, when it's raining it becomes less",
          "This lovely old funicular takes you up over the city . There are lovely gardens up top though we didn\u2019t find a place for coffee. The views are on four sides which makes the layout of the city comprehensble.",
          "A pleasant walk along the riverside until you reach the signs for the funicular, pay your \u20ac3/5 single/return (I think) and then a three minute ride to the top. Great 180\u00b0 views of the city and a park area to relax or exercise in. The area can be accessed by road for cars and",
          "This is a short funicular - and very good value with a travelcard, but the views at the top are amazing and there's a few places for a bite to eat too. Well worth a visit!",
          "Only a three minute ride to the top, runs every 15 minutes so not a long wait at all. Worth the \u20ac2 single trip and then about a 45 minute walk down the mountain, or it\u2019s \u20ac3.60 return. Worth the price either way",
          "This short and steep funicular ride is excellent value-the views of Bilbao from the top are brilliant, especially in sunny weather. There is a park at the top but, as other reviewers have commented, it would be nice if there was a cafe/restaurant overlooking those great views!",
          "The funicular is easy to get to and use, and the staff were very helpful. The ride itself is quite steep. There is a lovely park at the top with views across Bilbao.",
          "The place was just a walking distance from our hotel whic is the Barcelo Bilbao Nervoin. We ride on a train going up to Artxanda. The place was so amazing, quiet and the weather is slightly cold since it is already sunset. You can stay there long just sitting and walking and",
          "Take a trip on the funicular -- up, up, up the hill to a park overlooking Bilbao. The ride is fun and the views are spectacular. Cheap thrills!",
          "Really nice little funicular ride But not a lot to do at the top after you\u2019ve seen the lookout point, unless you want to go trail walking (we love that but weren\u2019t able to) They are missing a trick here but in another way we love that Bilbao is so under developed as it feels",
          "The ride is pleasant and not too long It is easily accessible from casco viejo The view is very nice I agree with others they are missing a cafe up there to enjoy",
          "Yes, the views over the city and to the surrounding hills are, as you would expect, really nice, but the lack of facilities and activities when you get to the top kind of means there's not really anything to do (how long can you look at the tops of buildings?). There are a",
          "The view is spectacular and really highlights the city built around the river. Beautiful vista and a pretty quick trip.",
          "Well worth a trip up, think it cost 3.60 for a return trip, lovely park at the top with a fantastic view of the city. We spent an hour or so watching the sun go down behind the mountains and all the city lights come on. Beautiful.",
          "You get a great view from Bilbao city and surroundings when you\u2019re up in Artxanda. The trip there with the funicular takes 3 minutes and it costs 2\u20ac. It goes every 15 minutes. Really worth a visit.",
          "My hotel was at the top of this funicular railway, and this made it much easier to get into town. There\u2019s a viewing platform at the top with views of the city, but otherwise probably not anything much worth visiting at the top. The bottom spits you out very near one of the",
          "Took a while to find the entrance as googl maps actually sends you way up in the mountains! Great value at \u20ac3.60 for a return journey. Arrived at 8am and there was no queue and only 3 other passengers.",
          "Cheap enough and a decent view of Bilbao from the top but it is crying out for a nice refreshment area at the summit where you could enjoy a cool beer or a nice glass of wine while taking in the view.",
          "Easy to find. Pay cash or card \u20ac3.60 return for adults. Short 5 minute trip but busy standing in warm cars. Views at the top well worth it. We walked about a bit further but nothing open (Monday in September). Return easy to get every 15 minutes up 7am to 10pm). Some bars and",
          "The funicular entrance was not easy to find. Even though it was very close to the Hotel Nervion. Round trip ride is 3.50euris for a good view of Bilbao- spotting Guggenheim, River, old town, bridges...etc. looking at the pictures believe it was a casino o the past. Wish there\u2019s",
          "The train goes every 15 mins and can take maybe 50 people each go. At the top there are fabulous views of Bilbao and the word Bilbo repeated along a promenade. It is quite striking. In most other cities somebody would have opened a cafe at the top but there is a park for kids",
          "Excellent value at \u20ac3.60 return. I went in on a Saturday morning and there was no queue although when I came back down it was getting busy with the local families going up with picnics. There was a beautiful clear blue sky and so could see the old town, mountains and Guggenheim",
          "If you have a spare half hour take the trip up for the spectacular views of the city you won't be disappointed. Trains depart in both directions every 15 minutes and there is a nice park at the top to relax in and take in the views.",
          "Worth a visit. Excellent views of Bilbao. Good walking tracks from the top. Park nearby to rest and enjoy the scenery.",
          "I arrived in Bilbao on a public holiday, but the funicular was running, so I took a trip to the top. It seems to run every 15 minutes and a return ticket was about E3.80 I think. Nice views when you get to the top, I think you can walk further up the hill also, I did not.",
          "Even if you don't like cable cars (like me), this is doable - as it just runs up a track. Very steep climb up the mountain though. But it is worth it, for the stunning views all over Bilbao and neighborouring countryside once you are at the top.",
          "It is worth the ride to go up and get a better view of the city! It was just a short ride up, and there's a nice park to walk around while you enjoy the view of the city.",
          "Nice ride up the hill to get great views of the city Nice park at the top to walk around but its all about the views Definately a must do in Bilbao",
          "This is a must if you visit Bilbao! Situated in the street over the river to the Guggenheim this is easy to find and a short walk. For \u20ac3.50 return journey (which is great value) you can take the Funicular to the top which then offers amazing views of the city and a great photo",
          "It costs only \u20ac3.60 for a return ticket on this lovely little funicular to a great little park and viewpoint over the city of Bilbao. It's a great way to start a day's exploration.",
          "3.50 euro round trip in July 2019. Absolutely worthwhile. Lots of areas to sit so bring snacks or lunch. The views are phenomenal from the top. Highly recommend.",
          "You won't get these views of Bilbao from anywhere so i would definitely recommend this. The funicular experience itself is fun - it's a short but very steep climb and well worth the money.",
          "You must use this funicular. It\u2019s in a street opposite the Gugenheim museum from the other part of the river and you go up the hill from where you can admire the whole city and take amazing pictures. The weather must be clear when you decide to go up there.",
          "If you are in Bilbao this is a must do, takes you to the top of the mountain with excellent views over the city! Great opportunity tot take pictures with the \"Bilbao\" sign",
          "Over a 100 years old is this steep ride upon the mountains, resulting in a great view over the city of Bilbao. Nice park on top offers various walking routes. When waiting in line to go up, a spanish man thought h\u00e8 didn't have to wait and walked along the line with his 2",
          "This was worth the visit. There are lovely views at the top. It's a bit quiet once you get there but it gives a great panoramic view of the city.",
          "Found our way to this after learning of it fro ma tour guide. The bottom station is situated over the river and behind in the area to the rear of the town hall. Its all really easy to get to from any bridge along the river, with most having signposts. We walked from the stadium",
          "Great day out with great views. It\u2019s possible to purchase your tickets on line for specific times. If you don\u2019t, be prepared for a long wait.",
          "One thing to note is that the entrance to the Funicular is near the Matiko station, not up the hill as our Google map indicated (Google maps might fix this!). A fast 3.6 euro ride and return and the park at the top is lovely with spectacular views! There is a moving plaque",
          "A very cheap way to get a great view of Bilbao - around \u20ac3 for a return ticket. It takes 3 minutes to get to the top, and you can take your bike with you.",
          "It's fairly easy to take the #19 bus to the tram terminal, then the tram to the top. Great views from the top and a mini amusement park complete with a boat ride in the water for the kids. At least two bars and a restaurant, but high prices. Can do a lot of walking and climbing",
          "Easy to find with tourist signs pointing you in the right direction. Very cheap too and not the usual tourist rip off. Once you get your ticket [or the Bilbao pass], scan it at the turnstile and away you go. Not many seats but it is only a short hop to the top where you are",
          "Take a trip up the mountain for an excellent view of the city and surrounding area. The park at the top is nothing special, but pleasant enough.",
          "Although we had a little trouble finding the entrance, the discovery was part of the journey. Who doesn't love a good funicular ride? I sure do! Our 12 year old daughter enjoyed it too. The view of the city from the top was pretty spectacular. I'd say this is an essential",
          "Good option to get to a beautiful place and enjoy the amazing views of the city. I recomend it. There is a good place to walk.",
          "A quick ride up to a stunning view from the top of the funicular...You can see all round Bilbio from the top nice walks around and about too.If you walk to the right of the finicukar you come to a lovely restaurant that serves food all day. Snacks and main meals.",
          "Short walk after crossing the foot bridge, very reasonable fee with a great view from the top. It runs every 15 minutes on the hour.",
          "We rode to the top (\u20ac3.60) and only spent a short time there enjoying the extensive views over this lovely City and it\u2019s surroundings. Worth it for the views & experience, but it won\u2019t occupy a lot of your time.",
          "From the top, an impressive view of bailbao appears. The only problem is that there is not a place to eat once you get there. Some of teh restaurants were closed, and others were distant.",
          "Wasn't sure what to expect. Beautiful view from the top where you can see all the attractions of the city. Nicely shaded viewing platform area too.",
          "A must to do in Bilbao as the views from the park at the top are amazing. Make sure you go when the weather is good.",
          "Three minute ride available about every 15 mins some seating available. Great views await at the top and there are a few bars and restaurants but we took a picnic on this occasion.",
          "We\u2019ve been on other funicular rides in other cities, like Lisbon, but still took the short ride on this one. We used our Barik cards to access the funicular & waited in the queue to enter the little cabs. It was full, tourists & locals too using this energy saving mode of",
          "It\u2019s easy to cross the river from the Guggenheim on the spectacular pedestrian bridge to get to the entrance of the funicular. A smooth ride to the top gives an excellent view of the whole town and access to a park where locals and visitors alike enjoy the area. As you exit the",
          "We walked there which is over a bridge across the river then a couple of streets in you will find the cave like entrance, the tickets are cheap for a quick journey up and great views of the city. It was very windy when we went. You can also get there by the red hop on hop off",
          "Ride the funicular de Artxanda high above Bilbao for excellent views of the city below. Great for seeing city layout and beautiful Guggenheim Museum.",
          "The funicular railway is an easy stroll from the centre of town, or from the Guggenheim. The trip to the summit is a short one (barely three minutes) and the height is only some 250 metres, though it seems much higher than this when you are up there. The train/cars don't have",
          "Went up the funicular it\u2019s only a 3 minute journey to the top but has greats views of all of Bilbao including the Guggenheim. If you want to walk down you can get which takes about 30 minutes but be aware quite a gradient decline. One tip is that there is a really good",
          "Worth an hour of your time for sure. Maybe take 30 minutes at the top for savouring the views. There is a very nice (but expensive) restaurant 5 minutes walk to the right from the exit at the top. Make sure to use the Bilbao travel card for the journeys up and down as makes a",
          "This funicular was great. The views from above were picturesque and you can see all over the city and beyond. Price was really cheap. Definitely worth going to in Bilbao",
          "Great service, not expensive and great to see Bilbao\u2019s panorama. They run often. Bilbao panorama is great to see. I was told they added the rails with Bilbao letters all around recently-not to my liking as it spoils the nature around. Also, if you are a wheelchair user, because",
          "Great value trip to enjoy views over Bilbao from the hilltop. The paniramic views allow you to pick out all the main buildings and areas of the city.",
          "Great value trip up the steep hill from where you can see the spread out town on one side and the airport on the other. Lots of local families up there so clearly its not juts a tourist attraction! Well worth a trip",
          "I do love travelling on a funicular. Sometimes you get great views, sometimes you get interesting tracks or cars. But at the end of it, you know there will be amazing views at the top! This one has a pretty cool looking car. Slanted to fit the mountain side. Not much in the",
          "We took the funicular de Artxanda-Santo to see the view of Bilbao I had been here on many occasions and took my 4friends to show them the spectacular view! We walked around the gardens then sat on the terrace tif a lovely restaurant and had some pinxitos and a few wee drinks in",
          "The views of Bilbao from the top of the hill are spectacular! We were fortunate enough to have had a beautiful sunny day!!!",
          "We took the train up to the park at the top. The views of Bilbao are fantastic. Nice for a quiet walk. There are restaurants at the top, but we just went for the views.",
          "We arrived in Bilbao late afternoon and went for a stroll along the river . We came across signs to the funicular which closes late around 10 pm , and decided it would be a nice trip up . The return fee is 3.2 Euros but we purchased a Barik card for 3euro and topped it up with",
          "Nice trip up to a spectacular view across \"La Concha\". Enjoy the view on one side to the untamed Altlantic, on the other to San Sebastian's main beach.",
          "Worth a visit up the hill to catch the view of Bilbao. Was not the best day weather wise for us so didn\u2019t stay long at the top. Probably worth a wee picnic up there but with all the lovely pintxos in the bars in Bilbao will be hard to do.",
          "We visited here on the first day after breakfast in a local cafe, not much to see going up but once there you can see all of Bilbao, nice bar at the top to try before heading back down.",
          "A short, but lovely journey up to a park and restaurants on one of the hills above Bilbao. And what a view! What a breathtaking location the city enjoys. We didn\u2019t have to wait for the journey, so the funicular seems to run up and down regularly. All seats face forward and",
          "An experiance to not miss. A breathtaking journey to the top of the hill every 15 minutes. Price 3.60 \u20ac for a return ticket.",
          "Took our tribe of four kids up for some fresh air and a new perspective on Bilbao. Great views, and they enjoyed the ride up and back down.",
          "No doubt it's a nice view from above. BUt there isn't much more to it, unless you want to have a picnic or walk back down ( or you walk up and take the funi down). If you consider going up there, why not do it on the day you arrive. You get an overview and don't lose too much of",
          "Great view of the whole city \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc easily accessible it\u2019s a great cafe at the top for a coffee before heading back down. Great value for money",
          "The only way to see the magnificent presence of the city in the valley! The funicular serves every 15 minutes and is easy to use! We recomend the visit for the views!",
          "We took the funicular to the top off the hillside for the view of Bilbao. It\u2019s well worth the visit. Views are spectacular and the cafe bar at the top is nice reward...",
          "This little funicular railway is a fun trip if you are staying in Bilbao. Very cheap and it only takes a few minutes to get to the top. Super views over the city. Horrid public toilets. There are some restaurants at the top but we didn\u2019t try any of them so can\u2019t provide a",
          "This is a fun thing to do. Wonderful views from the top which give a good prespective of the layout of Bilbao",
          "You will get to the top of the hill just in 3 minutes, running every 15 mins. If the weather is good, you can expect beautiful views and take photos of yourself and the sign Bilbao.",
          "Used our travel card to go up - great views from the top. Lots of people took picnics - we walked towards san roke- odd area with a lot of what looked like derelict buildings - but found a restaurant in a corner that was nice - worth a visit up the funicular just for the views.",
          "Loved using this ingenious Funicular. It arrives every 15 minutes and is completely comfortable, quite and quick.",
          "It takes you to Artxanda Mountain where to could enjoy amazing views of the city and the whole Ibaizabal valley.",
          "It's worth going up as the view from the top over the whole city is spectacular, but don't be fooled by the promise of restaurants and shops at the top. Yes there are some eating places but it's all rather run-down and decrepitat the top, so you won't stay long.",
          "The funiclar takes visitors to a park which has amazing views of the city ( great for orientation) lovely walks and a great restaurant. There is also a memorial to those lost in the Spanish Civil War... a reminder that things were not always so beautiful here.",
          "Spectacular and Cheap 3,6 euro Nice views all around. Toilets though were not se Clean and had no paper",
          "Nice short trip to the top. If it's not too hazy you can see all of the city and you can take some time to relax a in the park. There are some walks, which we didn't do.",
          "If you always wondered what they were talking about in To Catch A Thief now is your chance to find out!",
          "This was excellent the 7 euros return trip gives amazing views over the city. The train is quick and easy takes about 5 mins.",
          "you can walk easily to the Funicular which takes you uphill in no time where you can catch beautiful views over Bilbao you can go for a little walk, there's a park on the left when you exit",
          "It really is just part of the public transport system in Bilbao but that doesn't make it any less entertaining. For less than 3 euros you've got a return ticket that brings you up the mountain from which you can enjoy the view. Can recommend. Dogs are allowed in a special",
          "Need to take this ride up to the top of the city. Cool park with places to eat and art to see. Get a view of the entire city!",
          "What a fun way to enjoy a stunning view of the Bilbao. It takes only 5 minutes to get to the top but Kids love it!",
          "Well worth the ride up the funicular as the view over Bilbao is terrific. Runs every 15 mins so no delays",
          "This funicular train was built around 1915, the short 3 minute journey takes you to Mt Artxanda. There\u2019s a lovely trail, huge red signs saying Bilbao and fabulous views over the city.",
          "The funicular was on my \u2018to do\u2019 list in Bilbao. Such an attraction brings out the inner child in everyone. A few euros for return trip. There was a lovely view from the top of Bilbao. No waiting time today but I imagine there\u2019s one in the busy season. Prams and bikes accomodated",
          "The funicular is only 20minutes walk from the Guggenheim museum. The fare is under 2 euros for a one way trip that last a couple of minutes.",
          "For a city that so little to offer the tourist, the funicular needs a revamp - the views on the way up/down are bit derelict, other than a view of the city the top has nothing to offer. The ticket staff seem ignorant and just didn't like tourists... Given this is usually listed",
          "Its a bit of a walk uphill to find the lower station, but worth doing. A fun ride up and a possibly walk down if you wanted. Park at the top with a view. Did not find a cafe, but we probably did not explore enough.",
          "I went to the funicular on a foggy day and couldn\u2019t see anything. I decided to go back in the next day and was so glad I did. The view was breathtaking. Sub\u00ed por el funicular en un d\u00eda nublado y no vi nada. Decid\u00ed volver al d\u00eda siguiente que hizo sol y vali\u00f3 la pena. La",
          "We really enjoyed the view and the train to the top. The price was very good as well. However the train and queue were slow, compared with similar trains on e.g. ski holiday.",
          "This is as nice little ride. It won't take long, but you can take some nice pictures of the city with the Guggenheim and so on",
          "The actual funicular is great and very exciting for my three year old. When you get to the top the views are spectacular, especially as we went in January and all the mountain tops in the distance were snow capped. It is very punctual and feels well maintained. When you get",
          "It\u2019s a great trip up the hillside with spectacular views over Bilbao. \u20ac3.25 for a round trip. The funicular leaves every 15 mins. Apparently there was an ice rink at the top back in the day!",
          "Very quick to get to the top and a fair price, lovely restaurants to go at the top and the view was just stunning and they have a good photo op with Bilbao signs",
          "Loved this. Fabulous views. Recommended. \u20ac3.25 return ticket. Well worth it. An easy addition to our trip.",
          "We rode the funicular during mid September, 2018. Round trip ticket is a bargain. We stood in the front (most downhill) compartment for the best views. Views from the overlook at the top are even better. The short walk on the nearby streets to the old sanctuary to the east",
          "Got views across Bilbao even on a cloudy day. Very popular with local families on Sunday. Very cheap to use - about 3.75 euros return & walks to do at the top. Take a picnic.",
          "A must visit when in Bilbao. Great views of the city, places to have food or a drink and a fun ride on the funicular up and down!!",
          "A Sunday when there is a massive sponsored walk taking place from the top is possibly not the best time to take the funicular. However we went up at about 10.30 and managed to avoid the queues. The cost of a return journey is 3.25 Euro but you can pay less if your intention is",
          "Or if you buy the Bilbao Pass, definitely go up the funicular. Doesn't take long and the view gives you an idea of the layout and size of Bilbao as well as landmarks in miniature. Not expensive but without the Pass, we probably would have skipped it.",
          "Taking you high up to park overlooking the city, this is a very enjoyable journey. The park and the view are very worthwhile. And, it is a funicular! You know how I love these. - Sadly, the casino is long gone. I can only imagine how much fun it was. \u20ac6.00 - roundtrips for 2",
          "Whatever you do, don't stay on the platform viewing platform - if you travel up at the front of the carriage, when you get off there isn't the sign that is outside all the doors further up, advising you to leave the platform immediately. If you stay on the the platform (well.",
          "The funicular takes people from the city to the top of the mountain where there is an expansive view of the city and the valley. Worth a diversion for the view.",
          "This is a fun ride, easy to mount if traveling with children or elderly folks. There is a beautiful view of the city below, a nice park for strolling and seats for just relaxing. Take some time to out of your busy day and enjoy Bilbao in the sky.",
          "This historic funicular railway runs every 15 minutes and whisks you from the Bilbao riverside to a green hilltop in just a couple of minutes. The return trip costs just \u20ac3.25 per person and gives you a stunning view over the city. Too bad the cafe/restaurant at the top is so",
          "We purchased the 1 day tourist pass for 10 euros & the funicular was included so took the opportunity to go up and see the amazing views over Bilbao and its surrounds. Definitely worth doing!",
          "friendly staff, easy travel only problem was lack of signageat the top to the cafes. Great views of city and it showed the different architecture of buildings and the different eras.",
          "The terminal is easy walking distance from the Guggenheim and old town-we had to wait a few minutes in the queue to get our turn. The views from the top of the mountain are wonderful-not just Bilbao and its suburns and river below you, but also the surrounding mountains and the",
          "The best way to see the vast city from the top of the line , looking down upon the town , not expensive and well worth the visit",
          "A quick trip up the side of the mountain. There is a quaint park at the top with a spectacular view of the city. If you are takjng pictures, time your visit to agree with the sun...so you are not looking into it.",
          "So cheap to do, easy to find and the view from the top is beautiful. Take a picnic if you have time and the weather is good - a lovely place to relax and take in the City from above",
          "Take the funicular to get a great view over the city of Bilbao! Well worth the \u20ac3.25 round trip. Would recommend.",
          "The receptionist recommended it, and she was so right. We went there to enjoy the sunset, and the views of the city were simply stunning. You could watch Bilbao and its river, full of lights, and surrounded by mountains. It was really great. Going up is also quite cheap, less",
          "The no 72 bus takes you to the entrance. It\u2019s a cheap and quick ride to the top. Worth the view of the city and it\u2019s a nice cool place on a hot day",
          "Short walk from Zibizuri bridge. Return ticket \u20ac3.25. Splendid views all over Bilbao resting in a tight valley.",
          "You can use your Bilbao transport card to ride the funicular. The views from the top are amazing (although they could do with doing a bit of tree pruning.) Lovely, well laid out park.",
          "This was the first activity we did after arrival in Bilbao and it was a great choice. We walked along the river, following signs to the Funicular then, for a very modest charge, got round trip tickets. The view from the top was gorgeous and we were able to identify many",
          "An enjoyable experience to get a panoramic view of the city. It would have been nice to find a coffee shop at the top but nevertheless we enjoyed the good views.",
          "This is a cheap and worthwhile activity that helps you understand the context of Bilbao. Everyone loves a funicular! There is a park at the top from which you have a fabulous view. You can see why Bilbao is where it is - a river plain in the midst of beautiful mountains. Open",
          "The trains depart every 15 min. It is totally worth it, for the amazing views over the city. Also on top of the hill there are a couple of restaurants .",
          "A great way to get to the top of the hill. From here you get great views of Bilbao. The ride to the top only takes 10 minutes and you get good views are you ascend.",
          "An easy stroll to the base station. Frequent trains. Coffee etc at the top. Marvellous views of a great city.",
          "when you go up, you have a very nice view over Bilbao when there are no clouds....., friendly staff and service is good,",
          "We took a ride up the funicular for 6.50 for two adults. At the top there is a good view point of the city. We went towards the end of our trip and could see how much of the city we walked.",
          "Cheap - just over three euros return. Frequent timetable. Really great views over Bilbao and its wonderful river. Not much else up at the top.",
          "Escape the heat of the day and travel up to the park at the top to see the panorama of Bilbao laid out below. A few minutes walk to a couple of restaurants, perfect to relax and chill!",
          "Close to Zuni Zuri bridge. Short ride to top of mountain. Views of city. Not much to see up there other than the views.",
          "Wow,worth it just to see Bilbao from above,so quiet at the top,a lovely hour well spent,on decent a few nice little pinxto bars and bus 72 takes you all the way back to town for 1.30 euro",
          "The funicular is very well maintained and appropriately priced. The view from the top seemed good, but there was no proper viewing point so I had to walk down a hill and cross a fairly busy road (to a side without a footpath) to obtain the best view. Even then tree branches and",
          "Recently went there; just another tram only this one is going up. Looks to be in good shape. Train ride takes about 10 minutes; there are some nice viewpoints up there, no cafe or whatsoever.",
          "Well worth a trip to the top for the view, the closest Cafe was not easily accessible by wheelchair when you finally find it",
          "Took this little train on a sunny afternoon and were thrilled with the amazing views of the city and surrounding areas.",
          "Not really much to see after taking in the view which is spectacular. We had hoped to have a coffee but couldn't find anywhere so after a stroll around we took the funicular back down.",
          "A nice quick trip up the mountain to see the city below including the Guggenheim. The view gives you a good sense of how condensed the city is. Be sure to find the large metal finger print structure and the story behind it along the walkway.The tram ran every 15 minutes.",
          "One way to enjoy Bilbao landscape is by taking this Funicular. It is so easy to access, not so far from the city centre. It was raining when I was there, but still, I can enjoy the city landscape, view to the river and the city. I believe if it is not raining, walking around",
          "Good value for a nice view of the city. It was a bit hazy when we went in the late afternoon, but the view was still worth the trip. The park at the top was a pleasant place to sit and enjoy the drinks and snacks that we brought with us.",
          "Prices where a bit higher then indicated in our guide book - still not too expensive. The view from the top is very nice and for sure worth the trip. The funicular had a bad smell and was quite crowded. Might be better if they go a bit more often.",
          "Well worth the low cost fare, and I certainly wouldn't consider walking either up or down! Lovely views and we visited a superb restaurant, will review that another time. Here for a few days, may well come for a repeat visit next week.",
          "Cheap and easy way to occupy the kids while catching a spectacular view of the city. It runs frequently and when you get to the top, there's also a small playground and cafe. If you have more time to spare, you can take a stroll uphill to the church.",
          "We walked it from the Portugalese Cercanias Station over the Vizcaya transporter bridge and then along the promenade past the palatial villas of early 20th century merchants and entrepreneurs. We took the metro back to town and were saved a daunting climb up the steep hill by",

          "Trains run every 15 mins and take 5 mins to get to the top. Great view of the city from there. Cheep and Cheerful way to spend a morning or afternoon.",
          "On one side there are fantastic views and a little park. The other side has a little restaurant, parking and a picnic area where there isn\u2019t anything to see. You may feel that you want to stay up there to make the most of it but after 15-20 minutes you\u2019re done. It\u2019s nice/ok",
          "The Funicular is a short trip giving an excellent view of the complete city of Bilbao with the surrounding hills. Well worth doing. Buy a return ticket.",
          "Quick fun trip to have great views over the city. Great open air swimming pool at the top if the sun is out and the mood takes you.",
          "First piece of advice is to get a Barik card as you can use this everywhere, on all forms of transport in and around Bilbao. It works out much cheaper and it is easy to use, just like the old Oyster cards in London. The trip up is pleasant and you get some good views. Our",
          "A very novel (and quick way) it get above the city, nice park at the top with cafe and lots of benches. Great views over the city and lots of photo opportunities, very reasonable price.",

          "Old style funicular that takes you up one of the hills surrounding Bilbao. The ride is short and goes frequently. There is a small green park at the top. The views of the city the river are the reason to go. Worth the hour it takes",
          "The reason I do not give it better score is that I had expected better view from the funicular itself, but the view from the top is very Nice. There is a Nice garden. But I had expected to find a cafe or something With the view, but we did not see any on the top.",
          "Less than 4 euros for a return trip, it's worth every penny for the high vantage point over Bilbao. You can see the whole city laid out for you. A lovely park too to rest in.",
          "after walking a day in the city, this funicular was a nice moment to repose a moment. On the top you have a nice view on the city.",
          "You cannot spell Funicular without f-u-n. The views up top are extraordinary, with the Guggenheim and waterfront below, and the coastal range on the horizon. The car holds a few dozen people so the queue may seem to stall and get too long during the few minutes when the",
          "3.60 euros for a return ticket and regular service every 15 minutes ticket office was slow but that may have been down to language difficulties with some of the customers. getting in the queue early gives you a better chance of getting a seat - we had people standing both",
          "On a lovely sunny day we got the funicular to the top, enjoyed the view and walked back down to the city. To the right of the top station and down the road a few hundred meters there is a quiet track that leads you back down the hill, traffic free.",
          "We took the little train to go up. The price is much higher than what I looked up online. The view was very nice, though they were painting the 'Bilbao' letters, so we had to stay behind the fence. This was not very nice, and we didn't receive any warning before coming up. You",
          "It is an unusual thing to do, but highly recommended A ten minute walk from the Guggenhim Bilbao is a city, and most Peuple will be there on a city break, zoo all the more reason to do something a bit different and to get above the city. Cool, green, refreshing, pleasant",
          "Included on the Bizcaya Card, travel for free to the top, get the overview over the city and surroundings. There is also a nice park area for relaxing, having a picnic is a good alternative. Monday is not a good day for restaurants nearby, as they are often closed. There is",
          "We enjoyed our trip on the funicular - it was good value and there were some lovely views at the top, although you wouldn't need to spend too long there as the restaurants in Bilbao centre are nicer.",
          "A great view of the city and the surrounding hills gives you a real perspective of Bilboa. Well worth the stroll from the old town or Guggenheim. Tip - return tickets are \u20ac3.75 but pay only \u20ac0.58 each way if you use the barik (contactless ticket you can also use on the metro,",
          "good views and photo opportunities at the top. It was a bit of cloudy day but still worth going- take a picnic no where really for lunch.",
          "Great views on a clear day. Worth spending a few hours doing this. Take a picnic to the top. It\u2019s about \u20ac3 each return for an adult. Walking distance from the Guggenheim.",
          "Easy to find this modern little railway (the one in San Sebastian is very rickety in comparison) Regular service every 15 mins all day. At 6.50 euros return for 2 of us it made getting up to the park more comfortable. Those views from the top - WOW!",
          "Easy to use ticketing system, and frequent journeys to the top. At the top there are beautiful views of Bilbao.",
          "We opted to get off at the Funicular stop of the hop-on hop-off bus. \u20ac3.25 return ticket took us the the top of the hill overlooking majority of Bilbao in the tourist sense. Pleasant walk from the funicular near a tree-lined park area which gives one a panoramic view from the",
          "Sometimes you need to get away from the buildings and just enjoy the surrounding countryside. A trip on the funicular is well worth the walk. You have a great view of Bilbao and you can get a great idea of where everything is",
          "If you are planning to go to Artxanda, which you should even just for the wonderful views of Bilbao, take the funicular. It's quick, 3 minutes, and fun to do something different.",

          "Great ride up to beautiful vistas of Bilbao. Breath of fresh air from congestion of the city. And way cool tbat from park at top you can see the river that runs through Bilbao just below AND the Atlantic Ocean off into the distance. Cooler air and grass at top would make great",
          "The funicular is SO hoot in the carriages. I could not believe the heat and with 12 people in each carriage it was not pleasant. Luckily its a short journey to the top so its worth it. The views are stunning as you look down on the city. Take your tome to stroll around the",
          "It\u2019s worth the walk to take the funicular up to Artxanda and view this very compact city from above. There is a pleasant walk around and many photo opportunities whilst up there. Facilities and resturant at top great place for a picnic.",
          "this incline is charming and a good time for families, couples and kids. its cheap and the view is stunning at the top. there is a grocery at the bottom of the hill that servces fresh juice that is out the this world and inexpensive too. healthy and beautiful market but its",
          "I like to get acquainted with a new city from an elevated position to see its layout, so visiting this viewpoint was on our must do list. The funicular starting point is close to the White Zubi Zuri bridge, two streets inland from the river on a small square. The return ticket",
          "a need to visit for a great view over Bilbao! The Train is very special, so this is definitely a must-see in Bilbao, preferred at sunny weather",
          "No idea how this was built in 1915. Amazing engineering. A great thing to do when in Bilbao. Even on a cloudy day we loved our trip to the top",
          "For E3.25 for a return ticket and an hour of your time, this is well worth doing just to see the views. If, like us, your experience of Bilbao is limited to the bit between the old town and the Guggenheim, then you will be amazed how much more there is. Ony problem was the",
          "Near the river and Zubizuri, you would hardly believe that there is a train that takes you in very few minutes to the top of the hill, with fantastic views of the city and the mouth of the river to the sea.",
          "This Funicular is well signposted from the river. The ride is used by the locals and only takes a few minutes. Once at the top there is a short walk to get wonderful views of the Guggenheim Museum and up the river to the hills beyond. Well worth the few Euros it cost.",
          "For just a few euros take the train up and enjoy spectacular views across Bilbao. We took a picnic up and sat enjoying the view and atmosphere. There is a restaurant a short walk to the right of where you disembarked. A must see view of a great city.",
          "We got meat and cheese at the local deli and rode up to the most incredible view of the city. A nice shady park close for a picnic. A great experience.",
          "The funicular is well worth riding to the top - even if the weather is on the wet side. THe views are good over the city. When we visited they were working on the railing so most views were behind temporary fencing. Also nothing up top was open so after a quick look and some",

          "We took the round trip for E 3.75 it only takes a few minutes each way. Views across the city are expansive, although it was a little misty when we got there. There area number of municipal buildings at the top and a main road (with a bus setvice) goes over the top also.",

          "After visiting Gugghenheim area you can cross the Calatrava white bridge and look fir this conveyance station nearby. Get your ticket and enjoy a short ride to one of the hills surrounding Bilbao. There are green areas and a few nice restaurants over there, just like the one",
          "I had been to Bilbao, briefly, a long time ago and apart from San Mames (the old one) and the Guggenheim I didn't know too much about the city, but on our first evening we went to the Sir Winston Churchill English pub. Here we were given a lot of tourist help from the bar staff",
          "Get to the top and the views are amazing. You really get a sense of Bilbao and the geography of the place. The gardens are peaceful and it's just a lovely place to walk around for a short while. There's nothing much but the garden so don't expect it but nice all the same if you",
          "This funicular was only \u20ac1.90 return last October and now \u20ac3.25. Still cheap in relative terms. Lovely views out over Bilbao from the top.",
          "Just a stones throw away from the centre, you can take the funicular to the top and view Bilbao and the surrounding area. Such fantastic views of all the sights of the city. Such a relaxing place. Remember to take rain wear as the weather can change in a blink! But the good",
          "After a walk through the back streets of Bilbao, we find the Funicular. I love these old yet modernised pieces of engineering. The ride was fantastic, slowly going our way up to the viewing area of Bilbao, we kind of look in reverse. Fun and very much a bargin. Also once you get",
          "It's a short journey up to the top of the funicular to get an amazing view of the city - play Spot Your Hotel or Look there's the Guggenheim. Only takes a few minutes and there's a sweet little park at the top. If you fancy getting up a bit higher, walk about 1km following signs",

          "To get a real overview of Bilbao take a ride up in the funicular railway. The ride is easy and comfortable in modern carriages and you can\u2019t get a better view of the city and it\u2019s surrounds, unless you took a helicopter! It is worth doing.",
          "Stumbled on the railways whilst walking around Bilbao - worth the trip to the top to see the views over the city for only a few Euro's",
          "Only 3.50 Euro for a return ticket but well worth the visit. Stunning views from the top, although could be a little more enterprising with the cafeterias.",
          "When we went, I think it was about 3.5\u20ac per person for the round-trip ride. The park and fountain at the top are well maintained, and the view was beautiful at sunset. A must do!",

          "Well worth heading up on the funicular and a return trip is slightly cheaper. Good views though there is a bit of building work going on but you can still take some good photos. We took a picnic and if you wander round there are some picnic tables around. Also a few nice",

          "After walking round the outside of the Guggenheim, it is a short walk down the river and over the Zubizuri bridge. The funicular runs from a block away from the river and is a good way to get the scale and geography of the city. Depends on the weather as to how good the view",
          "Its well worth the small fee to take the funicular up to the hilltop and enjoy some great views of Bilbao. Probably the building that stands out most is the huge San Mames stadium, which is on the edge of the city centre area",
          "A must visit for rail enthusiasts and sightseers as the view from the top is excellent. A cheap return ticket enables you to spend time at the top where there are several restaurants, none open when we went though. From here you can look down on the Guggenheim Museum from the",

          "We bought 2 BilbaoCards at the airport and arrived to the top of the funicular by car. This way we could park for free and get to the city with our BBcards with the funicular for free. It was quite a good combination later throughout our busy day as we used metro, buses, tram",
          "Nice little trip and worth the effort to find. The cafe at the top is ok if you can see it, but the views across Bilbao are fantastic. Don't forget to look for the airport!",
          "Really easy to take this funicular and pretty quick to the top of this hill, with great views over Bilbao. We actually then chose to walk down via google maps which was easy (about 3km) and good exercise! my calf muscles felt it the next day but we enjoyed this way back down.",

          "We were staying in a hotel about 2km from the funicular station in Artxanda and, being reluctant to take our car into the city, used the funicular for the very practical purpose of getting down into Bilbao. Parking is easy and free close to the station, trains run every 15",

          "I love these Funiculars! When you\u2019re in Bilbao it is something you definitely should do as you have the best view over the whole city. Also the sunset in combination with the view of the city is amazing and worth the few Euros for using the Funicular.",

          "We parked in the quite large area near the top of the funicular and for 3.25 Euros each we got a return ticket. It gave us a great day out and a long enjoyable ride.",

          "If in Bilbao you must do this one the vertical rise over the slope is impressive. Quick journey to the top for a great view of Bilbao. There is a lot oof information and display of the history and construction ut alas no english translation but you get the picture so to",
          "Seems to be retaining the funicular just for the tourists, but not really worth it. Just a park up there, and nothing else.",
          "We took the Funicular twice during our stay the first being a wet miserable day for something to do so it was a quick trip up & down due to poor visability but on our last day the sun was out so we decided to repeat the experience and so pleased we did what fantastic views you",
          "fortunately the lady at the tourism office hinted that the funicular is something exiting ..and it really is ...the best view of the city of Bilbao ...even the Atlantic can be seen from up there ...but the nicest thing is the view down on this beautiful city squeezed in a small",

          "This is a fun trip to the top of the ridge overlooking Bilbao. Great views from the top. We chose to walk down and picked up a section of the Camino de Santiago into town. Great walk to the east.",
          "Took the Funicular on a rainy day in Bilbao. It's really cheap to do and a fun experience. The views, although good, would be much better on a clear day. Because of the weather we just did a quick up and down and didn't really explore beyond the view point.",
          "Tienes que subir al funicular ,es una visita obligada y tendr\u00e1s una estupenda vista de toda la ciudad. You have to get on the funicular, it's a forced visit and you'll have a great view the whole city.",

          "We popped up the Funicular on a drizzly Sunday morning. It was a cheap and easy way to get some lovely views of the town. However the top was disappointing. There really isn't much there and the buildings that are there are run down, full of graffiti and desolate. It was all in",

          "This is situated not too far from the town centre and the walk to it is flat and easy. The actually ride takes approx 5-10 mins with a good view at the top of Bilbao. It's good for a walk when you reach the top and even for a picnic if you fancy",

          "Great views. Cheap. No lines. Walk down. It is fun. Great views. Worth the effort. Great views. Inexpensive",
          "This is definitely worth a trip across the river from the Guggenheim to view the city, river and surrounding hills. It was very cheap, but I was a bit confused because I seemed to need to buy a ticket up and a separate ticket back down. There was some kind of hermitage about",
          "For 95 cents ride the hundred years old funicular railway. At the top the area is a bit run down but it has some great views, a roller skate park (free) and a large outdoor pool! 3 or 3 good restaurants are within a short walk. We walked to San Roque church (waste of time -",

          "After crossing the bridge at the Guggenheim, it\u2019s a short walk to the funicular. The \u20ac 0.95 ticket for a one-way ride is a bargain for the 3-minute trip up to the top of the hill. From the hilltop, we were presented with great city views enjoyed from a small park. Round trip",
          "Pleasant experience, panoramic photos, park with benches, small area for children for rollerskating. Possibility for walk around",
          "For a cheap ticket price to use the cable car up to the top... the views are breathtaking of Bilbao. And there is also a little park there too to take advantage of and have a picnic or to simply sit and enjoy the view",

          "We took the funicualar to the park at the top of town and had amazing views of the Guggenheim and Bilbao.",
          "Cheap to board with amazing views of the city at the top. Not so much to do once you get off, unless you're prepared to walk, but well worth it for the views alone.",
          "A rewarding trip with the funicular railway up the steep slope to the summit of Artxanda to enjoy a nice view over the city and the wild mountains beyond. The trip itself with the funicular creaking and moaning its way up the hill was worth the visit and bonus in summer it\u2019s",
          "A quick trip up the funicular to view the city, unfortunately in the rain but just about clear enough at the top to see. Very cheap, 95c each way for adults 38c for kids.",

          "The grand entrance was near our hotel and intrepid friends urged us to accompany them up the mountain. The funicular is modern and less scary than some, but quite steep, offering amazing views as it rapidly climbed the hillside. We marveled at the 360 degree views from city to",
          "An incredible cheap and fun ride to the top of the world to see the best panoramic views of Bilbao. A must do whilst visiting. Lovely park at the top.",
          "The Artxanda funicular is a touch of early 20th-century ingenuity and glamour. I'd never been on a funicular train before, so this was just a little bit exciting, and worthwhile for the fascinating views. There are plenty of notes, photos and items from its history, and",
          "The Tourists Bus has a stop at this site. The Funicular costs a few euros. An hour is enough to take pictures and get down to the Tourist Bus stop to continue you tour. We enjoyed the site very much.",

          "Great little throwback attraction. Modernized cars silly but probably safer. View from the top good and the walk down exceptional.",
          "In contrast to San Sebastian's funicular (which was old, at least my age), this funicular was new and modern (a few years old) and rose up quickly and efficiently. Once we got out we saw a panoramic view of the Bilbao. we spent some time visiting in the garden which contain",
          "The Artxanda is worth a visit. From the top you have a great view on whole Bilbao. Also some nice parks, a swimming pool and some recreational areas. A round trip with the funicular only costs 0,95 \u20ac. That's worth it for sure. Maybe, also walk from the peak to the next hill, Mt",

          "We were lucky enough to be able to take the Funicular the last day in Bilbao because it had stopped raining! The view is spectacular from above and you can't beat the fare price 2 Euros !",
          "At less than 1 of them there Euro things you'd be totally insane to miss out on this. The ride is less than 3 minutes and so, you may think, the views can't be that good but you'd be wrong they are fantastic! Buy a ticket get on board and float silently (ish) up the hill side,",

          "Just a few minutes walk from Hotel Miro brought us to a quick ride up the hill and provided tremendous views of the city. The funicular was inexpensive, clean, relatively new, and easy. As you head up the hill, the city opens up behind you, and just ahead is a beautiful park",

          "It was a little tricky to find and we walked the wrong way! The easiest way (from the Guggenheim) would have been over a footbridge called the White Bridge (Zubi Zuri). It was worth the trek... the air at the top os fresh and cool and the views over the city fromthe park at the",
          "For a very small fee this has to be a must do. Couldn't understand why there were no queues because I would not have missed this. Not clearly signposted, it is three streets from Barcelo Bilbao Nevion Hotel, which is on the river. The clear views over the city were first",

          "A fairly fast system to climb to the top of the mountain. The price seems a bit excessive for the route it is, but it is the best way to go up. If you buy the round trip together the amount is a little lower. \u2026",

        "wiki": "The Basilica of Bego\u00f1a (or Bas\u00edlica de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Bego\u00f1a in Spanish) is a basilica in Bilbao, in Spain, dedicated to the patron saint of Biscay, the Virgin Bego\u00f1a.\nThe current parish priest is Jes\u00fas Francisco de Garitaonandia.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe basilica started life in the 16th century, designed by Sancho Mart\u00ednez de Arego. It has three naves, to which the addition of vaults was completed in the 17th century in construction work that took a century, having started in 1511. During the time of this work, the Gothic style began to show Renaissance influence, and the arched mid-16th century main entrance reflects the transitional style of the Spanish architect Gil de Honta\u00f1\u00f3n. The remainder of the building remains purely Gothic in style.\nDuring the 19th century, the basilica was damaged as a result of it forming part of Bilbao's city wall. The Carlist General Tom\u00e1s de Zumalac\u00e1rregui was fatally injured near the basilica. The current tower and part of the exterior were designed by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Basterra and built between 1902 and 1907.\n\nOn 16 August 1942, an incident between Falangists and Carlists resulted in several grenades exploding near the church.  Accounts differ on number of injuries and whether any were killed, but the incident highlighted dangerous rifts between Spanish nationalist factions and prompted a restructuring of Franco's government.  A prominent Falangist, Juan Jos\u00e9 Dom\u00ednguez, was controversially sentenced to death and executed by firing squad as a punishment for the incident.Work was carried out to correct the damage, however, and from September 1993 to June 1994, extensive cleaning and restoration work was carried out on the stone and the clock face and bells were repaired. The clock tower houses 24 bells, with the heaviest weighing a tonne, and were built in Sumiswald, Switzerland. The history of the clock tower dates back to 1922, and currently, seven different melodies can be produced.\n\n\n== La Salve and the basilica ==\nThe \"La Salve\" (Spanish for \"salute\" or \"Hail Mary\") quarter of Bilbao is so named because it is the first point where sailors returning up the river Nervi\u00f3n, which passes through the city, were able to see the basilica's steeple. As a result, they would start to pray to the Virgin Bego\u00f1a here, thanking her for having looked after them during their time at sea.\n\n\n== Festivities and celebrations ==\nThe major festivals take place every 15 August (Assumption of Mary), and 11 October, the saint day of Bego\u00f1a. Midnight mass is celebrated on these occasions, with pilgrimages taking place as locals and visitors go to worship.\nAccording to the basilica's website, many sailors still remember the significance of the building, with \"Virgen de Bego\u00f1a\" or \"Bego\u00f1a\" being popular names among fleets.\nThe basilica is open to the public from Monday to Friday, 9:30am to 1:30pm and 4:30pm to 8:30pm.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBasilica website (best viewed in Spanish or Basque)",

          "After schlepping up the inordinate amount of steps from the old town to the Basilica it was disappointing to find that it was closed. Although our guide book told us that one could ask the warden to let one in by knocking on the door, this was not in fact correct. Please",

          "1st its very hard to find, along the river but under the concert hall. 2nd It's NOT a maritime museum but rather one about Bilbao's riverfront, history and shipping. 3rd it could have been so much better with some signage as to the direction of the exhibits. Not worth it.",
          "This museum is a quirky collection of items associated with ship building, the role of the estuary, and various things nautical. It is a fairly new museum located right on the estuary which adds to the ambiance.",
          "We visited this museum during a short holiday in Bilbao. As far as museums go it is not large or amazingly glamorous but it is very well set up and a lot of the visual-audio information is extremely well done. There is a small theatre at the beginning of the exhibition, you",
          "For the money I felt we were a little short changed. Two well presented floors with interesting artefacts. Boards with translations and some good audio visual stuff. It whet the appetite but we ended up wanting more.",

          "It's Ok - I quite liked all the displays made of Playmobil, but I guess that was aimed more at the children. I'd heard that there were external exhibits, but when we there (early April) there wasn't. Maybe we were out of season, but it was a little disappointing. Even my",
          "We only decided to go to the Maritime Museum because it was raining! As it happens the rain was a very good thing. The museum was brilliant. For some strange reason I have been to many maritime museums in Spain and this one was certainly one of the best. The first thing I did",

The Bilbao metropolitan area has 1,037,847 inhabitants, making it one of the most populous metropolitan areas in northern Spain; with a population of 875,552 the comarca of Greater Bilbao is the fifth-largest urban area in Spain. Bilbao is also the main urban area in what is defined as the Greater Basque region.\nBilbao is situated in the north-central part of Spain, some 16 kilometres (10 mi) south of the Bay of Biscay, where the economic social development is located, where the estuary of Bilbao is formed. Its main urban core is surrounded by two small mountain ranges with an average elevation of 400 metres (1,300 ft). Its climate is shaped by the Bay of Biscay low-pressure systems and mild air, moderating summer temperatures by Iberian standards, with low sunshine and high rainfall. The annual temperature range is low for its latitude.\nAfter its foundation in the early 14th century by Diego L\u00f3pez V de Haro, head of the powerful Haro family, Bilbao was a commercial hub of the Basque Country that enjoyed significant importance in Green Spain. This was due to its port activity based on the export of iron extracted from the Biscayan quarries. Throughout the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth, Bilbao experienced heavy industrialisation, making it the centre of the second-most industrialised region of Spain, behind Barcelona. At the same time an extraordinary population explosion prompted the annexation of several adjacent municipalities. Nowadays, Bilbao is a vigorous service city that is experiencing an ongoing social, economic, and aesthetic revitalisation process, started by the iconic Bilbao Guggenheim Museum, and continued by infrastructure investments, such as the airport terminal, the rapid transit system, the tram line, the Azkuna Zentroa, and the currently under development Abandoibarra and Zorrozaurre renewal projects.Bilbao is also home to football club Athletic Club de Bilbao, a significant symbol for Basque nationalism due to its promotion of only Basque players and one of the most successful clubs in Spanish football history.\nOn 19 May 2010, the city of Bilbao was recognised with the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize, awarded by the city state of Singapore, in collaboration with the Swedish Nobel Academy. Considered the Nobel Prize for urbanism, it was handed out on 29 June 2010. On 7 January 2013, its mayor, I\u00f1aki Azkuna, received the 2012 World Mayor Prize awarded every two years by the British foundation The City Mayors Foundation, in recognition of the urban transformation experienced by the Biscayan capital since the 1990s. On 8 November 2017, Bilbao was chosen the Best European City 2018 at The Urbanism Awards 2018, awarded by the international organisation The Academy of Urbanism.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe official name of the town is Bilbao, as known in most languages of the world. Euskaltzaindia, the official regulatory institution of the Basque language, has agreed that between the two possible names existing in Basque, Bilbao and Bilbo, the historical name is Bilbo, while Bilbao is the official name. Although the term Bilbo does not appear in old documents, in the play The Merry Wives of Windsor by William Shakespeare, there is a reference to swords presumably made of Biscayan iron which he calls \"bilboes\", suggesting that it is a word used since at least the sixteenth century.There is no consensus among historians about the origin of the name. Generally accepted accounts state that prior to the 12th century the independent rulers of the territory, named Lords of Zubialdea, were also known as Lords of Bilbao la Vieja (\"Old Bilbao\"). The symbols of their patrimony are the tower and church used in the shield of Bilbao to this day. One possible origin was suggested by the engineer Evaristo de Churruca. He said that it was a Basque custom to name a place after its location. For Bilbao this would be the result of the union of the Basque words for river and cove: Bil-Ibaia-Bao. The historian Jos\u00e9 Tussel G\u00f3mez argues that it is just a natural evolution of the Spanish words bello vado, beautiful river crossing. On the other hand, according to the writer Esteban Calle Iturrino, the name derives from the two settlements that existed on both banks of the estuary, rather than from the estuary itself. The first, where the present Casco Viejo is located, would be called billa, which means stacking in Basque, after the configuration of the buildings. The second, on the left bank, where now Bilbao La Vieja is located, would be called vaho, Spanish for mist or steam. From the union of these two derives the name Bilbao, which was also written as Bilvao and Biluao, as documented in its municipal charter.\nAn -ao ending is also present in nearby Sestao and Ugao, that could be explained from Basque aho, \"mouth\".\n\n\n=== Demonym ===\nThe demonym is \"bilba\u00edno, -a\", although the popular pronunciation bilbaino/a (sic) is also frequent. In euskera it is bilbotar, which is sometimes also used in Spanish, generally within the Basque Country. \nThe village is affectionately known by its inhabitants as the botxo meaning  hole, since it is surrounded by mountains. The nickname \"botxero\" is derived from this nickname. Another nickname that Bilbao receives is that of \"chimbos\", which comes from birds that were hunted in large numbers in these places during the 19th century.The titles, the flag and the coat of arms are Bilbao's traditional symbols and belong to its historic patrimony, being used in formal acts, for the identification and decoration of specific places or for the validation of documents.\n\nTitlesBilbao holds the historic category of borough (villa), with the titles of \"Very noble and very loyal and unbeaten\" (\"Muy Noble y Muy Leal e Invicta\"). It was the Catholic Monarchs who awarded the title \"Noble borough\" (\"Noble Villa\") on 20 September 1475. Philip III of Spain, via a letter in 1603 awarded the borough the titles of \"Very noble and very loyal\". After the Siege of Bilbao, during the First Carlist War, on 25 December 1836, the title of \"Unbeaten\" was added.\nCoat of arms\nThe coat of arms is emblazoned as follows:\n\nIn a silver field a bridge with two eyes, added to the church of San Ant\u00f3n of its color and to its sinister two sable wolves walking and in stick, on waves of azure and silver.\nFlagThe flag that represents it is white with a red block, in a ratio of three parts long by two wide. The colors red and white are the historical ones of the villa.\nThe Royal Order of 30 July 1845 determined the maritime password for the population. This was defined as a white flag with an upper red die next to the pod. The die should be square and the length of its side should equal half of the pod. Previously, at least since 1511, the banner that the  Bilbao Consulate  was wearing was white with a red Cross of Burgundy. The relationship of the town with the mercantile and marine activities was always very strong coming to share headquarters. In 1603 the new consistorial house is inaugurated and in it the headquarters of the city council and of the referred one  Bilbao Consulate  are located. The intimate relationship made the flag of the Consulate was related as a flag of the town by citizenship.\nThe definition of the maritime flag in 1845 was assumed by the population, who accepted it as their own, and so did the city council. At the inauguration of the Bilbao-Miranda de Ebro railway line, it was already used as a symbol of the town's representation, being permanently adopted in 1895 although no resolution has been adopted for this purpose.Although it has always been assumed by the municipal institution and citizenship, at the beginning of the 20th century it was discussed in a municipal plenary session about the determination of a flag for the town. There was talk about \"the use of the crimson color of the Lordship of Biscay, or of the cross of Saint Andrew\" but without reaching any resolution to the effect.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-history ===\nRemains of an ancient settlement were found on the top of Mount Malmas\u00edn, dating from around the 3rd or 2nd century BC. Burial sites were also found on mounts Avril and Artxanda, dated 6,000 years old. Some authors identify the old settlement of Bilbao as Amanun Portus, cited by Pliny the Elder, or with Flaviobriga, by Ptolemy.\n\n\n=== Medieval Bilbao ===\n\nAncient walls, which date from around the 11th century, have been discovered below the Church of San Ant\u00f3n. Bilbao was one of the first towns founded in the fourteenth century, during a period in which approximately three-quarters of the Biscayan cities were developed, among them Portugalete in 1323, Ondarroa in 1327, Lekeitio in 1335, and Mungia and Larrabetzu in 1376. Diego L\u00f3pez V de Haro, then third Lord of Biscay, founded Bilbao through a municipal charter dated in Valladolid on 15 June 1300 and confirmed by King Ferdinand IV of Castile in Burgos, on 4 January 1301. Diego L\u00f3pez established the new town on the right bank of the Nervi\u00f3n river, on the grounds of the elizate of Bego\u00f1a and granted it the fuero of Logro\u00f1o, a compilation of rights and privileges that would prove fundamental to its later development.In 1310 Mar\u00eda D\u00edaz I de Haro, niece of Diego L\u00f3pez V and Lady of Biscay, grants a new municipal charter to the city, which extends its commercial privileges even further, transforming the city in a mandatory stop for all the trade coming from Castile towards the sea. This second charter established that the road from Ordu\u00f1a to Bermeo, at the time the most important trade route in the lordship, had to traverse the San Ant\u00f3n Bridge in Bilbao instead of the pass in Etxebarri, as it did until then. This strengthened the position of Bilbao as a trading post, in detriment of Bermeo, city which until then had acted as the main port of the territory. In addition, Bilbao was granted exclusive rights to all trade between the city and Las Arenas. In 1372, John I of Castile strengthened even more the city's position by naming Bilbao a free port and granting it special privileges concerning the trade of iron. This caused Bilbao to become an important port, particularly due to its trade with Flanders and Great Britain.\nIn 1443 the Church of Saint Anthony the Great was enshrined, having been built in the place of an old alc\u00e1zar. Still today the church is one of the oldest extant buildings of the city. On 5 September 1483, the Queen Isabella I of Castile traveled to Bilbao to swear fealty to the fueros of Biscay. Her husband, Ferdinand II of Aragon had already done so in 1476 in Gernika.\n\n\n=== Modern age ===\n\nOn 21 June 1511, Queen Joanna of Castile ordered the creation of the Consulate of the Sea of Bilbao. This would become the most influential institution of the borough for centuries, and would claim jurisdiction over the estuary, improving its infrastructure. Under the Consulate's control, the port of Bilbao became one of the most important of the kingdom. The first printing-press was brought to the town in 1577. Here in 1596, the first book in the Basque language was edited, entitled Doctrina Christiana en Romance y Bascuence by Dr. Betolaza.In 1602 Bilbao was made the capital of Biscay, a title previously held by Bermeo. Around 1631, the city was the scenario of a series of revolts against the increased taxation on salt, which had been ordered by the Crown, an event locally known as the \"Machinada of the salt\". The revolt ended with the execution of several of its leaders. The city had seen a continuous increase of its wealth, especially after the discovery of extensive iron deposits in the surrounding mountains, and by the end of the century it managed to overcome the economic crises that affected the rest of the kingdom, thanks in part to the increased trading of wool (which now used the port of Bilbao instead of the one in Santander), and to the iron ore and its commerce with England and the Netherlands.\n\n\n=== Contemporary Bilbao ===\n\n\n==== Napoleonic invasion and Carlist wars ====\n\nThe French invasion of Spain saw the occupation of several Basque cities, but Bilbao was not among them. The first open uprising against Napoleonic rule took place on 6 August 1808, a month after the Battle of Bail\u00e9n. French troops sieged and sacked the city, alongside the neighbouring towns of Deusto and Bego\u00f1a on 16 August. Beginning on February 1810, the city was under the command of Pierre Thouvenot, general of the French army and Baron of the Empire, who had become the head of the Military Government of Vizcaya, which included the three Basque provinces. Thouvenot intended to move forward with the plan of total annexation of the Basque provinces into France, but the Peninsular War and ultimately the Battle of Vitoria made those plans impossible.\n\nThe Basque Country was one of the main sites of battles during the First Carlist War, a civil war between supporters of the Spanish regent Maria Christina, known as liberals, and those of the late king's brother Carlos of Borb\u00f3n, known as Carlists. The Carlists were particularly focused on capturing Bilbao, a liberal and economic bastion in northern Spain. The Carlist general Tom\u00e1s de Zumalac\u00e1rregui tried to take the city during the Siege of Bilbao of 1835, but he was wounded during a battle near Bego\u00f1a and died some time after in the town of Zegama. The next year, the city resisted a second siege during which the liberal general Baldomero Espartero defeated the Carlists in the Battle of Luchana. The city was untouched by the Second Carlist War, which took place mostly in Catalonia, but was again an important scenario during the Third Carlist War; in April 1874 the city suffered a third siege which lasted two months.Despite the warfare, Bilbao prospered during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, when it rose as the economic centre of the Basque Country. It was during this time that the railway first arrived to the city and the Bank of Bilbao (which later would go on to become the BBVA) was founded, as well as the Bilbao Stock Exchange. Steelmaking industries flourished with the creation of many new factories, including the Santa Ana de Bolueta and the Altos Hornos de Vizcaya in 1902. The city was modernised with new avenues and walkways, as well as with new modern buildings such as the City Hall building, the Basurto Hospital and the Arriaga Theatre. The population increased dramatically, from 11,000 in 1880 to 80,000 in 1900. Social movements also arose, notably Basque nationalism under Sabino Arana, which in the subsequent decades would grow to become the Basque Nationalist Party.\n\n\n==== Civil war and Francoist dictatorship ====\n\nThe Spanish Civil War started in Bilbao with a number of small uprisings suppressed by the Republican forces. On 31 August 1936, the city suffered its first bombing, with a series of air bombs dropped by Nationalist airplanes. In September, the Nationalists distributed pamphlets threatening further bombing if the city did not give up, which finally took place on 25 September when German planes, in coordination with Francoist forces, dropped at least a hundred bombs on the city. In May 1937, the Nationalist army besieged the town. The battle lasted until 19 June of that year, when Lieutenant Colonel Putz was ordered to destroy all bridges over the estuary, and the troops of the 5th Brigade took the borough from the mountains Malmasin, Pagasarri, and Arnotegi.With the war over, Bilbao returned to its industrial development, accompanied by a steady population growth. In the 1940s, the city was rebuilt, starting with the bridges and by 1948, the first commercial flight took off from the local airport. Over the next decade, there was a revival of the iron industry, which became a strategic industrial sector in Spain, as a consequence of the economic model promoted by the Francoism. The city received migrants from other Spanish regions looking to work in the iron industry. The demand for housing outstripped supply, and workers built slums on the hillsides. It was in this context that the first social movements arose and the strike of the Euskalduna shipyard in 1947 was the first one to take place during the Francoist dictatorship. In this environment of social repression, on 31 July 1959 the terrorist organisation ETA was created as an excision of the Basque nationalist movements. During the decade of 1960 the city was the scenario of several urban projects, with the creation of new neighbourhoods like Otxarkoaga and the motorway to the French border. In June 1968 the public university first arrived to the city with the establishment of the University of Bilbao, which later would be integrated into the University of the Basque Country.\n\n\n==== Democracy and urban renewal ====\n\nAfter the end of Francoist Spain and the establishment of a constitutional monarchy, in a process known in Spain as the transition, Bilbao was able to hold democratic elections again. This time Basque nationalists rose to power. With the approval of the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country in 1979, Vitoria-Gasteiz was elected the seat of the government and therefore the de facto capital of the Basque Autonomous Community, although Bilbao was larger and more powerful economically. In the 1980s, several factors such as labor demands and the arrival of cheap labor from abroad led to a devastating industrial crisis.On 26 August 1983 during the celebration of the local festivities known as Aste Nagusia, the estuary overflowed up to five metres in some areas due to the continuous raining, killing two persons and causing important destructions in the city's infrastructure, with a total economic cost that reached 60,000 million pesetas (around 360 million Euro)Since the mid-1990s, Bilbao has been in a process of deindustrialization and transition to a service economy, supported by investment in infrastructure and urban renewal, starting with the opening of the Bilbao Guggenheim Museum (the so-called Guggenheim effect), and continuing with the Euskalduna Conference Centre and Concert Hall, Santiago Calatrava's Zubizuri, the metro network by Norman Foster, the tram, the Iberdrola Tower and the Zorrozaurre development plan, among others. Many officially supported associations such as Bilbao Metr\u00f3poli-30 and Bilbao R\u00eda 2000 were created to monitor these projects.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nBilbao is located near the northern edge of the Iberian Peninsula, about 16 kilometres (10 mi) from the Bay of Biscay. It covers an area of 40.65 square kilometres (15.70 sq mi), of which 17.35 square kilometres (6.70 sq mi) are urban and the remaining 23.30 square kilometres (9.00 sq mi) consist of the surrounding mountains. The official average altitude is 19 metres (62 ft), although there are measurements between 6 metres (20 ft) and 32 metres (105 ft). It is also the core of the comarca of Greater Bilbao. It is surrounded by the municipalities of Derio, Etxebarri, Galdakao, Loiu, Sondika, and Zamudio to the north; Arrigorriaga and Basauri to the west; Alonsotegi to the south; and Barakaldo and Erandio to the east.\nBilbao is located on the Basque threshold, the range between the larger Cantabrian Mountains and the Pyrenees. The soil is predominantly composed of mesozoic materials (limestone, sandstone, and marl) sedimented over a primitive paleozoic base. The relief of the province is dominated by NW-SE and WNW-ESE oriented folds. The main fold is the anticline of Bilbao which runs from the municipality of Elorrio to Galdames. Inside Bilbao there are two secondary folds, one in the northeast, composed of Mounts Artxanda, Avril, Banderas, Pikota, San Bernab\u00e9, and Cabras; and other in the south, composed of Mounts Kobetas, Restaleku, Pagasarri and Arraiz. The highest point in the municipality is Mount Ganeta, of 689 metres (2,260 ft), followed by Mount Pagasarri, of 673 metres (2,208 ft), both on the border with Alonsotegi.\n\n\n=== Hydrology ===\n\nThe main river system of Bilbao is also the hydrological artery of Biscay. The rivers Nervi\u00f3n and Ibaizabal converge in Basauri and form an estuary named variously \"estuary of Bilbao\", \"of the Nervi\u00f3n\", \"of the Ibaizabal\", or \"of the Nervi\u00f3n-Ibaizabal\". The estuary runs for 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) and with a low flow (with an average of 25 m3 (883 cu ft) per second). Its main tributary is the river Cadagua, which rises in the Mena valley and has a basin of 642 square kilometres (248 sq mi), mostly lying in the neighboring province of Burgos. This river is also the natural border between Bilbao and Barakaldo.\nThe river has frequently suffered from human intervention, as seen in the dredging of its bottom, the building of docks on both banks and especially in the Deusto canal, an artificial waterway dug between 1950 and 1968 in the district of Deusto as a lateral canal, with the aim of facilitating navigation, sparing ships from the natural curves of the estuary. The project was stopped with 400 metres (1,300 ft) left to complete, and it was decided to leave it as a dock. However, in 2007, a plan was approved to continue the canal and form the island of Zorrozaurre. This human intervention has also brought negative results in the quality of the water, after decades of toxic waste dumping causing a situation of anoxia (lack of oxygen), which almost eliminated the entire fauna and flora. However, in recent years this situation is being reversed, thanks to a dumping ban and natural regeneration. now it is possible to observe algae, tonguefishes, crabs, and seabirds, as well as occasional bathers in the summer months.The estuary is also a natural border for several neighbourhoods and districts within the borough. Entering the municipality from the west it separates the districts of Bego\u00f1a and Ibaiondo, then Abando and Uribarri and lastly Deusto and Basurto-Zorroza.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nIts proximity to the Bay of Biscay gives Bilbao an oceanic climate (Cfb), with precipitation occurring throughout the year and without a well-defined dry summer. Precipitation is abundant, and given the latitude and atmospheric dynamics, rainy days represent 45% and cloudy days 40% of the annual total. The rainiest season is between October and April, November being the wettest. Snow is not frequent in Bilbao, although it is possible to see snow on the top of the surrounding mountains. Sleet is more frequent, about 10 days per year, mainly in the winter months. Bilbao is nearest to the subtropical boundary of all the Atlantic coastal cities in the country with an August daily mean of 20.9 \u00b0C (69.6 \u00b0F). There is also a drying trend in summer with only around 50 millimetres (2.0 in) of rainfall in July \u2013 but not dry enough to be considered Mediterranean.\nThe proximity of the ocean also means that the two best defined seasons (summer and winter) remain mild, with low intensity thermal oscillations. Average maximum temperatures vary between 25 and 26 \u00b0C (77.0 and 78.8 \u00b0F) in the summer months, while the average minimum in winter is between 6 and 7 \u00b0C (42.8 and 44.6 \u00b0F).\nExtreme record observations in Bilbao are 42.2 \u00b0C (108.0 \u00b0F) maximum (on 13 August 2003) and  \u22128.6 \u00b0C (16.5 \u00b0F) minimum (on 3 February 1963). The maximum precipitation in a day was 225.6 mm (9 in) on 26 August 1983 when severe flooding was caused by the Nervi\u00f3n river.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAccording to the Basque Statistics Office, the population of Bilbao is 342,397 people as of 2017, distributed on a land area of 40.59 km2 (16 sq mi), making Bilbao the largest city by population of the Basque Autonomous Community and of the Basque Country as a whole. Bilbao makes the main component of the Bilbao metropolitan area, with a population of 1,037,847 people.\nThe first credible data on the population of Bilbao are post-1550. It is known that in 1530 Biscay had approximately 65,000 inhabitants, a number that could have been reduced by plagues that struck the city in 1517, 1530, 1564\u201368, and 1597\u20131601, the last being especially devastating. This trend for periodic reverses in population growth was maintained until the nineteenth century. Since then, Bilbao has experienced an exponential growth in population thanks to industrialisation. After a peak of 433,115 inhabitants in 1982, the municipalities of the Txorierri valley were removed from Bilbao, with the corresponding loss of their population.Spanish is the most spoken language in the city, followed by the vernacular Basque language. According to the city government of Bilbao, at least 51% of the population can speak \"some Basque\", while 29% consider themselves to be fluent.\n\n\n=== Migration ===\nOut of the 355,731 people residing in Bilbao in 2009, only 114,220 (32.1%) were born inside the municipality. Of the remainder, 114,908 were born in other Biscayan towns, while 9,545 were born in the other two Basque provinces; 85,789 came from the rest of Spain (mainly Castile-Le\u00f3n and Galicia), and 33,537 were foreigners. There are 127 different nationalities registered in Bilbao, although 60 of them represent fewer than 10 people each. The largest foreign communities are Bolivians and Colombians, with 4,879 and 3,730 respectively. Other nationalities with more than 1,000 inhabitants are Romanians (2,248), Moroccans (2,058), Ecuadorians (1,832), Chinese (1,390), Brazilians (1,273) and Paraguayans, with 1,204.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nThe city of Bilbao is the capital of the province of Biscay and as such it is home of the administrative entities that pertain to the provincial administration, both from the autonomous and central governments. Settled in the city are the provincial delegations of the different departments of the Basque autonomous government, each coordinated by a representative. In addition, the Government of Spain has the official Government Subdelegation in the city.\n\n\n=== Municipal government ===\n\nBilbao is a municipality and has a mayor-council government system. The municipal government is elected for four-year terms by universal suffrage and it is divided into two branches, executive and legislative. The legislative side consists of a municipal plenum composed of 29 councillors. These councillors represent the different political parties elected in the local elections, for which can vote all residents registered in the city who are citizens of Spain or of any member state of the European Union. The executive branch is composed of the mayor and a board of governors. The number of members of the board cannot be more than a third the number of members of the legislative plenum and the mayor can appoint them at his or her own discretion.Since 1892 the seat of the government has been the Bilbao City Hall, located on the centric Ernesto Erkoreka plaza and by the Estuary of Bilbao. It is the fourth city hall building to have been used since the year 1300. The first three city halls were located by the San Ant\u00f3n Church but were destroyed due to floodings. The current building was designed by the Spanish architect Joaqu\u00edn Rucoba in Baroque style and was built in the former site of the San Agust\u00edn Monastery, which was destroyed during the First Carlist War. Since the Spanish transition to democracy, the city has been governed by the Basque Nationalist Party, often with support of the Socialist Party of the Basque Country. I\u00f1aki Azkuna served as mayor from 1999 until his passing in 2014, when he was replaced by Ibon Areso. Azkuna was awarded the World Mayor prize in 2012. Since the 2019 municipal election, the councillors of the plenum have the following political distribution: 14 seats for the Basque Nationalist Party, 5 seats for the Socialist Party of the Basque Country, 4 seats for the EH Bildu coalition, 3 seats for Udalberri and 3 seats for the People's Party. The mayor is Juan Mari Aburto, chosen with 19 votes from the Basque Nationalist Party and the Socialist party.\nIn 2008 and 2010, Bilbao won the Municipal Transparency Prize, awarded by the Spanish division of Transparency International. In 2009 it came second, after Sant Cugat del Vall\u00e9s.\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nThe municipality is divided into eight districts (Basque: barrutia) which are further subdivided into 34 neighbourhoods (Basque: auzoa). Most of the districts and neighbourhoods were former independent municipalities and elizates that were eventually annexed into the city. Originally, the city of Bilbao comprised the Old Town and some houses on the left side of the estuary, today known as Bilbao la Vieja. The first expansion included the annexation of the elizate of Bego\u00f1a and the river side of Uribarri. In the 19th century the merge of Abando into the city brought along small neighbourhoods of farm houses and hamlets that were clustered close to the former municipality's town hall and the Mount Cobetas, such as Errekalde and Basurto. Starting in the 20th century it started annexing the elizates on the right bank of the river, including Bego\u00f1a and Deusto. In the decade of 1960 as an effort to stop the increasing problem of slums, new neighbourhoods were created from the ground up, among them Otxarkoaga and Txurdinaga, which were joined together as a new district, Otxarkoaga-Txurdinaga in the decade of 1990.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe Bilbao metropolitan area comprises about 47% of the total population of the Basque autonomous community, out of which a 15% is registered in the municipality of Bilbao. The comarca of Greater Bilbao, in which the city occupies a central position, has a GDP per capita of \u20ac30,860, higher than the Spanish and European Union averages. The Bilbao metropolitan area has a nominal GDP amounting to $36,9 billion. Bilbao has been the economic centre of the Basque autonomous community since the original establishment of the Consulate of the Sea in the city in the 16th century, mostly thanks to the commerce in Castilian products on the town's port. It was in the 19th century when the city experimented its biggest economic development, mainly based on the exploitation of the nearby iron mines and siderurgy, both of which promoted maritime traffic and port activity and eventually the development of a very important shipbuilding industry.\n\n\n=== Banking ===\n\nBanking became an important sector with the establishment of the Bank of Bilbao (Spanish: Banco de Bilbao) in 1857 and the Bank of Biscay (Spanish: Banco de Vizcaya) in 1901. These two entities merged in 1988 creating the BBV, which finally merged with Argentaria bank in 1999, creating the current multinational corporation, the BBVA. The savings banks that were established locally, the Municipal Savings Bank of Bilbao (Spanish: Caja de Ahorros Municipal de Bilbao) in 1907 and the Provincial Savings Bank of Biscay (Spanish: Caja de Ahorros Provincial de Vizcaya) in 1921, would merge in 1990 to form the Bilbao Bizkaia Kutxa (BBK), which would marge again in 2012 with other Basque financial entities (Kutxa and Caja Vital Kutxa) to form Kutxabank. There is also the Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Navigation of Bilbao and the Stock Exchange Market of Bilbao, founded in 1890.\n\n\n=== Port ===\n\nThe historical port was located in what is today an area called the Arenal, a few steps from the old city, until the late 20th century. In 1902, an exterior port was built at the mouth of the estuary, in the coastal municipality of Santurtzi. Further extensions to the outer port, which became called \"the super-port\", led to the final move of the city portuary facilities in the 1970s, finally replacing the docks in the centre of the city, with the exception of those located in the neighbourhood of Zorrotza, still active.The port of Bilbao is a first-class commercial port and is among the top five of Spain. Over 200 regular maritime services link Bilbao with 500 ports worldwide. At the close of 2009 cargo movements amounted to 31.6 million tonnes, Russia, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries being the main markets. In the first semester of 2008, it received over 67,000 passengers and 2,770 ships. This activity contributed 419 million euros to the Basque GDP and maintains almost 10,000 jobs.\n\n\n=== Mining and ironworks ===\nIron is the main and most abundant raw material found in Biscay, and its extraction has been legally regulated since 1526. Mining was the main primary activity in Bilbao and the minerals, of great quality, were exported to all over Europe. It was not until the second half of the nineteenth century that an ironworks industry was developed, benefiting from the resources and the city's good communication links. In the 20th century, both Spanish and European capitals imported around 90% of the iron from Biscay. Although World War I made Bilbao one of the main ironworks powers, a subsequent crisis prompted a decline in the activity.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nThe first notion of Bilbao as a tourist destination came with the inauguration of the railway between Bilbao and the coastal neighbourhood of Las Arenas, in the municipality of Getxo in 1872. The connection made Bilbao a minor beach destination.The real tourist surge though would come much later with the inauguration of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in 1997. Thereafter tourist arrivals registered a continued upward trend, reaching over 932,000 visitors in 2018. The trend was exponential considering that in 1995, Bilbao only counted 25,000 tourists. Bilbao also hosts 31% of the total Basque Country visitors, being the top destination of this autonomous community, outranking San Sebasti\u00e1n. The majority of tourists are domestic visitors, coming from Madrid and Catalonia. International travellers are predominantly French, crossing the border just to the east. The others arrive from the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy. Tourism generates about 300 million euros yearly for the Biscayan GDP. Bilbao also draws business tourism, having been equipped with facilities like the Euskalduna Conference Centre and Concert Hall, and the Bilbao Exhibition Centre, in nearby Barakaldo.\n\n\n=== Stock exchange ===\nPlans to create a stock exchange market in Bilbao began in the early 19th century, even though it would not be realized until 21 July 1890. Bilbao's institution is one of the country's four regional stock exchanges, joining Barcelona, Madrid, and Valencia as Spain's commercial centres. It is owned by Bolsas y Mercados Espa\u00f1oles. The Bilbao Stock Exchange is considered a secondary market.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Urban planning ===\n\nIn its beginnings, Bilbao only had three streets (Somera, Artecalle, and Tender\u00eda) surrounded by walls located where Ronda street now stands. Inside this enclosure, there was a small hermitage dedicated to the Apostle Saint James (the current St. James' Cathedral), which pilgrims visited on their way to Santiago de Compostela. In the fifteenth century, four more streets were built, forming the original Zazpikaleak or \"Seven Streets\". In 1571, after several floods and a major fire in 1569, the walls were demolished in order to allow the expansion of the town.In 1861, engineer Amado L\u00e1zaro projected an ensanche inside the then-municipality of Abando with wide avenues and regular buildings, that included the hygienists ideas of the time. The project was mostly based on Barcelona's Eixample, designed by Ildefons Cerd\u00e0. However, the project was dropped by the City Council after considering it \"utopian and excessive\" because of its high cost, though of great quality. Furthermore, L\u00e1zaro had calculated the demographic growth of the town was based on the previous three centuries, a provision that eventually would not conform to reality.The next large urban change in Bilbao would come in 1876, when the capital annexed (in several stages) the neighbouring municipality of Abando. The new ensanche project was planned by a team made of architect Severino de Ach\u00facarro and engineers Pablo de Alzola (elected Mayor that same year), and Ernesto de Hoffmeyer. Unlike L\u00e1zaro's, this project was significantly smaller, compassing 1.58 km2 (0.61 sq mi) against the original 2.54 km2 (0.98 sq mi). It also featured a not so strict grid pattern, a park to separate the industrial and residential areas and the Gran V\u00eda de Don Diego L\u00f3pez de Haro, the main thoroughfare, where many relevant buildings were located, such as the Biscay provincial government hall or the BBVA Tower. By the end of the 1890s, this widening was half completed and already filled, so a new extension was planned by Federico Ugalde.By 1925, the municipalities of Deusto and Bego\u00f1a, as well as part of Erandio were annexed, and in 1940, the remaining part of Erandio became part of Bilbao. The last annexation took place in 1966, with the municipalities of Loiu, Sondika, Derio, and Zamudio. This made Bilbao larger than ever, with 107 km2 (41 sq mi). However, all these municipalities, with the exception of Deusto and Bego\u00f1a regained their independence on 1 January 1983.On 18 May 2010, the government of Singapore awarded Bilbao the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize, at the World Cities Summit 2010. It is considered the Pritzker of urbanism.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nBilbao's buildings display a variety of architectural styles, ranging from gothic, Art Deco, Art Nouveau, Neo-Gothic and contemporary architecture. The Old Town features many of the oldest buildings in the city, as the St. James' Cathedral or the Church of San Ant\u00f3n, included in the borough's coat of arms. Most of the Old Town is a pedestrian zone during the day. Nearby is one of the most important religious temples of Biscay, the Basilica of Bego\u00f1a, dedicated to the patron saint of the province, Our Lady of Bego\u00f1a.\nSeventeen bridges span the banks of the estuary inside the town's boundaries. Among the most interesting ones are the Zubizuri (Basque for \"white bridge\"), a pedestrian footbridge designed by Santiago Calatrava opened in 1997, and the Princes of Spain Bridge, also known as \"La Salve\", a suspension bridge opened in 1972 and redesigned by French conceptual artist Daniel Buren in 2007. The Deusto Bridge is a bascule bridge opened in 1936 and modelled after the Michigan Avenue Bridge, in Chicago. Between 1890 and 1893 the first transporter bridge (\"Puente Colgante\") in the world on the Nervion river, between Portugalete and Getxo, was built by Alberto Palacio (architect and engineer) together with his brother Silvestre.\nSince the deindustrialization process started in the 1990s, many of the former industrial areas are being transformed into modern public and private spaces designed by several of the world's most renowned architects and artists. The main example is the Guggenheim Museum, located in what was an old dock and wood warehouse. The building, designed by Frank Gehry and inaugurated in October 1997, is considered among architecture experts as one of the most important structures of the last 30 years, and a masterpiece by itself. The museum houses part of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation modern art collection. Another example is the Azkuna Zentroa, a wine warehouse built in 1909 and completely redesigned in 2010 by French designer Philippe Starck into a multi-purpose venue that consists of a cinema multiplex, a fitness centre, a library, and a restaurant, among other spaces. The Abandoibarra area is also being renovated, and it features not only the Guggenheim Museum, but also Arata Isozaki's tower complex, the Euskalduna Conference Centre and Concert Hall and the Iberdrola Tower, designed by Argentine architect C\u00e9sar Pelli which is, since its completion in 2011, the Basque Country's tallest skyscraper, 165 metres (541 ft) high. Zorrozaurre is the next area to be redeveloped, following a 2007 master plan designed by Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. This peninsula was transformed into a 500,000 m2 (5,400,000 sq ft) island and will feature residential and commercial buildings, as well as the new BBK seat.\n\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\n\nAs of 2010, Bilbao has 18 public parks inside its limits, totalling 200 ha (490 acres) of green spaces. Furthermore its green belt has a total area of 1,025 ha (2,530 acres), of which 119 ha (290 acres) are urbanized. The largest parks are Mount Cobetas, of 18.5 ha (46 acres), and Larreagaburu, of 12 ha (30 acres), both located on the outskirts.The Do\u00f1a Casilda Iturrizar park is located in the district of Abando, near the town centre and covers an area of 8.5 ha (21 acres). It is named after a local benefactress who donated the grounds to the borough. It is an English-style garden designed by Ricardo Bastida and opened to the public in 1907. It features a dancing water fountain surrounded by a pergola, and a pond with many species of ducks, geese and swans, which gives the park the alternate name of \"Ducks' Park\", as known locally. In recent years, it was expanded to be connected with the Abandoibarra area. In Ibaiondo, the Etxeberria Park was built in the 1980s in the place where a steel mill previously stood. The original chimney was maintained as a homage of its industrial past. It covers an area of 18.9 ha (47 acres), on a sloped terrain that overlooks the Old Town. Other relevant public spaces inside the city include the Europa Park, the Miribilla Park, or the Memorial Walkway, a 3 km (1.9 mi) long walkway, with 12 m (39 ft) high lamps, located in the left bank of the estuary and that connects the main sights.Mount Artxanda is easily accessible from the town centre by a funicular. There is a recreational area at the summit, with restaurants, a sports complex and a balcony with panoramic views. In the south, Mount Pagasarri receives hundreds of hikers every weekend since the 1870s, who seek its natural wonders. Its environment is officially protected since 2007.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nBilbao was appointed a \"City of Design\" by UNESCO in 2014 and has been part of the Creative Cities Network since then.\n\n\n=== Theaters ===\n\nThe main hall of the city is the Arriaga Theater, reopened in 1985 as a municipal venue with a varied repertoire that includes dancing, opera, live music and theatre. Also very active are the Campos El\u00edseos Theater and the Euskalduna Concert Hall. Other important venues include La Fundici\u00f3n, dedicated to contemporary dances and theatre; the Pabell\u00f3n 6, the Sala BBK and the Azkuna Zentroa.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nBilbao has more than a dozen museums covering a range of fields including art, science, and sport, which have played a central role in Bilbao being named one of the most creative cities in the world.The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, part of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, was inaugurated on 19 October 1997 and is work of the Canadian architect Frank Gehry. The museum's permanent collection is centered in the visual arts of the second half of the 20th century and the present, with relevant artworks from Richard Serra and Jeff Koons, although including as well temporary exhibitions with a more varied nature, like Russian art or engravings from Albrecht D\u00fcrer.Another important museum is the Bilbao Fine Arts Museum, first established in 1908 and housing a notable collection of Spanish and European work from the 12th century to present times. The collection from before the 20th century is centered mainly around Spanish and Flemish artists such as El Greco, Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n, Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo, Francisco Goya and Anthony van Dyck. The museum also holds one of the best collections of Basque art, with works from the 19th century to present times. It has an eye-catching collection of Avant-garde art, from the Post-Impressionism of Paul Gauguin to Pop art and the expressionism of Francis Bacon.\nThe Basque Museum showcases Basque archaeology and ethnography, and holds frequent exhibitions in the area of Basque history. The museum building itself is part of the heritage listing Conjunto hist\u00f3rico. The city also has several specialised museums, like the Maritime Museum Estuary of Bilbao (Bilboko Itsasadarra Itsas Museoa), located next to the Estuary of Bilbao, which holds ships and other collection related to the region's fishing and shipbuilding culture, being particularly relevant the Carola crane, last remaining element of the Euskalduna shipyard that existed where the museum now stands.\nOther relevant museums are the Biscayan Archeological Museum (Arkeologi Museoa) which holds important collections related to the region's prehistory, and the Diocesan Museum of Religious Art (Eleiz Museoa), both located in the Casco Viejo quarter.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nThe Euskalduna Concert Hall is home to frequent musical performances and it is home of the Bilbao Symphony Orchestra (Bilbao Orkestra Sinfonikoa) and the opera season programmed by the ABAO (Bilbao Association of Friends of the Opera). The Arriaga Theater is frequently the host of numerous musical events, other notable stages include the Philharmonic Society of Bilbao (chamber music) and Bilborock (pop and rock music). The city hosts many different musical festivities, often funded by the city hall. Due to its scope, it is especially relevant the Bilbao BBK Live festival, which has been celebrated every year since 2006 and focuses on Basque, Spanish and international pop and rock music. Since the opening of the new San Mam\u00e9s Stadium in 2013, it has been often used as an open-air concert venue, the first ever concert being one from the American band Guns N'Roses in 2017. Other relevant music festivals include the Bilbao Distrito Jazz and the Bilbao Ars Sacrum, the latter dedicated to religious music.\nBilbao is the birthplace of famous composer Juan Cris\u00f3stomo Arriaga, who lived his formative years in the city before moving to Paris at age 15. Also native from Bilbao were the soprano singer Josefa Cruz de Gassier and Natividad \u00c1lvarez, nicknamed Nati, la bilbainita (Spanish for \"Nati, the little one from Bilbao\") a dancer and castanets player who achieved national fame in the early 20th century. Also relevant is the Bilbao Choir Society (Bilboko Koral Elkartea), established in 1866. Important musical bands coming from the city include rock band Fito & Fitipaldis, Basque folk band Oskorri and folk-pop band Mocedades.\nBilbao hosted the 2018 MTV Europe Music Awards.\n\n\n=== Festivals and events ===\n\nBilbao hosts several regular festivals and events. The most relevant is the Big Week of the city (Aste Nagusia), celebrated annually since 1978 and lasting nine days. It is the city's main festival, attracting over 1,500,000 people every year. The festivities begin on the first Saturday before 22 August, and during those nine days the city hall organises a series of cultural events of diverse kind, including concerts, stage plays, Basque rural sports and bullfighting, as well as nightly firework displays. The festivities begin with the chupinazo or txupinazo, which is the launch of a small rocket, and the reading of a proclamation by the festivities' herald. The central point of the festivities is the place around the txosnas, where the different konpartsak are reunited, organised by neighbourhood associations as well as cultural, social and political groups. The symbol of the festivities is Marijaia, a large doll which is burned during the last day of celebrations.\nBeyond the main festivities of the Aste Nagusia, the city also celebrates some minor festivities, many of them religious in nature, such as Saint Agatha on 5 February, the celebrations of Our Lady of Bego\u00f1a on 11 October, the Day of Thomas the Apostle on 21 December and the Christmas festivities, centered around the figure of Olentzero. There are also festivities in the different neighbourhoods and districts which are celebrated locally, such as the Fiestas del Carmen in Santutxu and Indautxu, Fiestas Santiago in Bilbao la Vieja, Fiestas San Ignacio in San Inazio and Fiestas San Roque in Arxtanda and Larraskitu.\nThe city also hosts the International Festival of Documentary and Short Film under the commercial name of Zinebi. It was first held in 1959 under the name International Festival of Ibero-American and Filipino Documentary Film of Bilbao, with the goal of being complementary to the San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival. Since 1981 it is organised by the city hall and takes place in the Arriaga Theatre. Bilbao is also the host of the SAIL in Festival, a yearly event centered exclusively around sailing, which brings together international representatives of this sport.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nTraditional Bilbao dishes are centered around products from the sea and the estuary, such as eels and cod. For the most part Bilbao shares its original gastronomy with that of the province of Biscay, including dishes such as bacalao al pil pil (cod fish cooked with olive oil, garlic and guindilla peppers), bacalao a la vizca\u00edna (salted cod with Biscayan sauce, mostly made of choricero peppers and onions), merluza en salsa verde (hake fish with green sauce), chipirones en su tinta (squid served with its own ink), morros a la vizca\u00edna (beef snouts with Biscayan sauce), revuelto de perretxikos (scrambled eggs with mushrooms) and desserts such as canutillos de Bilbao (puff pastries filled with custard or chocolate), Pantxineta (puff pastries filled with custard and almonds), rice cakes and bollos de mantequilla (butter buns).\nBilbao, as other Basque cities, is known for a variety of appetizers and snacks, being prominent among them the pintxos, which are typically eaten in bars and that consist of small slices of bread on top of which is placed an ingredient or mixture of ingredients, generally of many different types and usually including elements typical of Basque cuisine. Other snacks include rabas (fried or battered calamari rings, usually served with lemon slices), Spanish omelette (omelette made with eggs and potatoes, sometimes including onions and peppers), txampis (stuffed mushrooms), tri\u00e1ngulos (Bilbao-style sandwiches), gildas (one or more olives, a guindilla pepper and an anchovy joined together with a toothpick).\nIn what refers to beverages, typical from the region is the txakoli, a white wine usually drunk as an ap\u00e9ritif. Biscayan txakoli (Bizkaiko Txakolina) is a protected Denominaci\u00f3n de origen for the white wine produced in the province of Biscay and it is usually served in Bilbao. Also typical are cider, patxaran (sloe-flavoured liqueur) and Rioja wine.\nThere are many restaurants and bars who serve these dishes and beverages, especially around the Casco Viejo quarter. Txokos are also a very popular institution in Bilbao, as in other Basque cities and towns. Bilbao, and the province of Biscay as a whole, is one of the spanish cities with a greater number of recognized restaurants by the gastronomic guides, among them several Michelin-starred restaurants.\n\n\n=== Language ===\nThe Spanish language is the most used language of the city, followed by the Basque language, which is vernacular to the region. The presence of Basque in the city is less prominent than in other municipalities of the region, such as Bermeo or Lekeitio. In 1986, the bilingual Basque-speaking population represented about 28% of the total. However, the number of Basque speakers has experienced a continuous increase since, reaching a number of 37% in 2001. More than half of the Basque speakers were younger than 30 and lived in the districts of Deusto, Bego\u00f1a and Abando.According to the data from the 2016 census, the population older than 2 years old registered in the municipality of Bilbao who speaks fluently represents 29% of the total population, while those who can speak it with difficulty represent around 19.95% of the total. Finally, those who cannot speak or understand the language represent the remaining 51.06% of the census.",

        "wiki": "The Bizkaia Delegation Palace is an eclectic mansion in the Ensanche area of Bilbao, Spain. It's the seat of the executive branch of Government of Biscay, the legislative assembly meets in Gernika. The Biscay Palace of the Foral Deputation (also known as simply The Foral Palace), located at 25 Gran V\u00eda, Bilbao, is a free-standing rectangular building, of solid and majestic appearance. Designed by the architect Luis Aladr\u00e9n Mendivil, it is considered \u201ca pinnacle work of Alfonsine eclecticism\u201d in Vizcaya.\nIt was built between 1890 and 1900 by the Gran V\u00eda de Don Diego L\u00f3pez de Haro avenue.\nIt bears resemblance to projected buildings at the end of the 19th century in its eclectic style, which is made self-evident in the use of elements of diverse historical styles and in, moreover, a great preoccupation with the composition of the facades in an ornamental way. The building consists of a basement, mezzanine, two floors, an attic, and a rooftop terrace.\nThe main fa\u00e7ade on Gran V\u00eda street stands out when one observes the advanced body from the line of the fa\u00e7ade, which includes a covered entrance over which there are a balcony and a coat of arms. Inside, the main staircase distributes and organizes the annexes.\nThe ornamental riches grow as much on the exterior as the interior, for example, chair cushions knit with diamonds, where there are numerous works of art surrounded by lush furniture and pictorial ornamentation on the walls and ceilings.\nIt bears mentioning the so-called 'Throne Room', which houses two painted murals by Jos\u00e9 Echenaguisa Errazquin (1844-1912), a painter of international success born in Fuenterrab\u00eda, a border town in Gipuzkoa province in the Basque Country. These murals, \u201cJuramento de los Fueros\u201d (Swearing of the Foros) and \u201cPacificacion de o\u00f1acinos y gamboinos\u201d (Peacemaking between the O\u00f1azes and the Gamboinos), are often reproduced in textbooks and history books that discuss the Basque Country.\nThere are diverse pieces of art conserved in the Palace, like a pair of jars gifted by Eugenia de Montijo, wife of Napoleon III of France.\nAcross the street on its back, there is the Library of Biscay.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Bilbao (, also US: , Spanish: [bil\u02c8\u03b2ao]; Basque: Bilbo [bil\u03b2o]) is a city in northern Spain, the largest city in the province of Biscay and in the Basque Country as a whole. It is also the largest city proper in northern Spain. Bilbao is the tenth largest city in Spain, with a population of 345,141 as of 2015. The Bilbao metropolitan area has 1,037,847 inhabitants, making it one of the most populous metropolitan areas in northern Spain; with a population of 875,552 the comarca of Greater Bilbao is the fifth-largest urban area in Spain. Bilbao is also the main urban area in what is defined as the Greater Basque region.\nBilbao is situated in the north-central part of Spain, some 16 kilometres (10 mi) south of the Bay of Biscay, where the economic social development is located, where the estuary of Bilbao is formed. Its main urban core is surrounded by two small mountain ranges with an average elevation of 400 metres (1,300 ft). Its climate is shaped by the Bay of Biscay low-pressure systems and mild air, moderating summer temperatures by Iberian standards, with low sunshine and high rainfall. The annual temperature range is low for its latitude.\nAfter its foundation in the early 14th century by Diego L\u00f3pez V de Haro, head of the powerful Haro family, Bilbao was a commercial hub of the Basque Country that enjoyed significant importance in Green Spain. This was due to its port activity based on the export of iron extracted from the Biscayan quarries. Throughout the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth, Bilbao experienced heavy industrialisation, making it the centre of the second-most industrialised region of Spain, behind Barcelona. At the same time an extraordinary population explosion prompted the annexation of several adjacent municipalities. Nowadays, Bilbao is a vigorous service city that is experiencing an ongoing social, economic, and aesthetic revitalisation process, started by the iconic Bilbao Guggenheim Museum, and continued by infrastructure investments, such as the airport terminal, the rapid transit system, the tram line, the Azkuna Zentroa, and the currently under development Abandoibarra and Zorrozaurre renewal projects.Bilbao is also home to football club Athletic Club de Bilbao, a significant symbol for Basque nationalism due to its promotion of only Basque players and one of the most successful clubs in Spanish football history.\nOn 19 May 2010, the city of Bilbao was recognised with the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize, awarded by the city state of Singapore, in collaboration with the Swedish Nobel Academy. Considered the Nobel Prize for urbanism, it was handed out on 29 June 2010. On 7 January 2013, its mayor, I\u00f1aki Azkuna, received the 2012 World Mayor Prize awarded every two years by the British foundation The City Mayors Foundation, in recognition of the urban transformation experienced by the Biscayan capital since the 1990s. On 8 November 2017, Bilbao was chosen the Best European City 2018 at The Urbanism Awards 2018, awarded by the international organisation The Academy of Urbanism.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe official name of the town is Bilbao, as known in most languages of the world. Euskaltzaindia, the official regulatory institution of the Basque language, has agreed that between the two possible names existing in Basque, Bilbao and Bilbo, the historical name is Bilbo, while Bilbao is the official name. Although the term Bilbo does not appear in old documents, in the play The Merry Wives of Windsor by William Shakespeare, there is a reference to swords presumably made of Biscayan iron which he calls \"bilboes\", suggesting that it is a word used since at least the sixteenth century.There is no consensus among historians about the origin of the name. Generally accepted accounts state that prior to the 12th century the independent rulers of the territory, named Lords of Zubialdea, were also known as Lords of Bilbao la Vieja (\"Old Bilbao\"). The symbols of their patrimony are the tower and church used in the shield of Bilbao to this day. One possible origin was suggested by the engineer Evaristo de Churruca. He said that it was a Basque custom to name a place after its location. For Bilbao this would be the result of the union of the Basque words for river and cove: Bil-Ibaia-Bao. The historian Jos\u00e9 Tussel G\u00f3mez argues that it is just a natural evolution of the Spanish words bello vado, beautiful river crossing. On the other hand, according to the writer Esteban Calle Iturrino, the name derives from the two settlements that existed on both banks of the estuary, rather than from the estuary itself. The first, where the present Casco Viejo is located, would be called billa, which means stacking in Basque, after the configuration of the buildings. The second, on the left bank, where now Bilbao La Vieja is located, would be called vaho, Spanish for mist or steam. From the union of these two derives the name Bilbao, which was also written as Bilvao and Biluao, as documented in its municipal charter.\nAn -ao ending is also present in nearby Sestao and Ugao, that could be explained from Basque aho, \"mouth\".\n\n\n=== Demonym ===\nThe demonym is \"bilba\u00edno, -a\", although the popular pronunciation bilbaino/a (sic) is also frequent. In euskera it is bilbotar, which is sometimes also used in Spanish, generally within the Basque Country. \nThe village is affectionately known by its inhabitants as the botxo meaning  hole, since it is surrounded by mountains. The nickname \"botxero\" is derived from this nickname. Another nickname that Bilbao receives is that of \"chimbos\", which comes from birds that were hunted in large numbers in these places during the 19th century.The titles, the flag and the coat of arms are Bilbao's traditional symbols and belong to its historic patrimony, being used in formal acts, for the identification and decoration of specific places or for the validation of documents.\n\nTitlesBilbao holds the historic category of borough (villa), with the titles of \"Very noble and very loyal and unbeaten\" (\"Muy Noble y Muy Leal e Invicta\"). It was the Catholic Monarchs who awarded the title \"Noble borough\" (\"Noble Villa\") on 20 September 1475. Philip III of Spain, via a letter in 1603 awarded the borough the titles of \"Very noble and very loyal\". After the Siege of Bilbao, during the First Carlist War, on 25 December 1836, the title of \"Unbeaten\" was added.\nCoat of arms\nThe coat of arms is emblazoned as follows:\n\nIn a silver field a bridge with two eyes, added to the church of San Ant\u00f3n of its color and to its sinister two sable wolves walking and in stick, on waves of azure and silver.\nFlagThe flag that represents it is white with a red block, in a ratio of three parts long by two wide. The colors red and white are the historical ones of the villa.\nThe Royal Order of 30 July 1845 determined the maritime password for the population. This was defined as a white flag with an upper red die next to the pod. The die should be square and the length of its side should equal half of the pod. Previously, at least since 1511, the banner that the  Bilbao Consulate  was wearing was white with a red Cross of Burgundy. The relationship of the town with the mercantile and marine activities was always very strong coming to share headquarters. In 1603 the new consistorial house is inaugurated and in it the headquarters of the city council and of the referred one  Bilbao Consulate  are located. The intimate relationship made the flag of the Consulate was related as a flag of the town by citizenship.\nThe definition of the maritime flag in 1845 was assumed by the population, who accepted it as their own, and so did the city council. At the inauguration of the Bilbao-Miranda de Ebro railway line, it was already used as a symbol of the town's representation, being permanently adopted in 1895 although no resolution has been adopted for this purpose.Although it has always been assumed by the municipal institution and citizenship, at the beginning of the 20th century it was discussed in a municipal plenary session about the determination of a flag for the town. There was talk about \"the use of the crimson color of the Lordship of Biscay, or of the cross of Saint Andrew\" but without reaching any resolution to the effect.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-history ===\nRemains of an ancient settlement were found on the top of Mount Malmas\u00edn, dating from around the 3rd or 2nd century BC. Burial sites were also found on mounts Avril and Artxanda, dated 6,000 years old. Some authors identify the old settlement of Bilbao as Amanun Portus, cited by Pliny the Elder, or with Flaviobriga, by Ptolemy.\n\n\n=== Medieval Bilbao ===\n\nAncient walls, which date from around the 11th century, have been discovered below the Church of San Ant\u00f3n. Bilbao was one of the first towns founded in the fourteenth century, during a period in which approximately three-quarters of the Biscayan cities were developed, among them Portugalete in 1323, Ondarroa in 1327, Lekeitio in 1335, and Mungia and Larrabetzu in 1376. Diego L\u00f3pez V de Haro, then third Lord of Biscay, founded Bilbao through a municipal charter dated in Valladolid on 15 June 1300 and confirmed by King Ferdinand IV of Castile in Burgos, on 4 January 1301. Diego L\u00f3pez established the new town on the right bank of the Nervi\u00f3n river, on the grounds of the elizate of Bego\u00f1a and granted it the fuero of Logro\u00f1o, a compilation of rights and privileges that would prove fundamental to its later development.In 1310 Mar\u00eda D\u00edaz I de Haro, niece of Diego L\u00f3pez V and Lady of Biscay, grants a new municipal charter to the city, which extends its commercial privileges even further, transforming the city in a mandatory stop for all the trade coming from Castile towards the sea. This second charter established that the road from Ordu\u00f1a to Bermeo, at the time the most important trade route in the lordship, had to traverse the San Ant\u00f3n Bridge in Bilbao instead of the pass in Etxebarri, as it did until then. This strengthened the position of Bilbao as a trading post, in detriment of Bermeo, city which until then had acted as the main port of the territory. In addition, Bilbao was granted exclusive rights to all trade between the city and Las Arenas. In 1372, John I of Castile strengthened even more the city's position by naming Bilbao a free port and granting it special privileges concerning the trade of iron. This caused Bilbao to become an important port, particularly due to its trade with Flanders and Great Britain.\nIn 1443 the Church of Saint Anthony the Great was enshrined, having been built in the place of an old alc\u00e1zar. Still today the church is one of the oldest extant buildings of the city. On 5 September 1483, the Queen Isabella I of Castile traveled to Bilbao to swear fealty to the fueros of Biscay. Her husband, Ferdinand II of Aragon had already done so in 1476 in Gernika.\n\n\n=== Modern age ===\n\nOn 21 June 1511, Queen Joanna of Castile ordered the creation of the Consulate of the Sea of Bilbao. This would become the most influential institution of the borough for centuries, and would claim jurisdiction over the estuary, improving its infrastructure. Under the Consulate's control, the port of Bilbao became one of the most important of the kingdom. The first printing-press was brought to the town in 1577. Here in 1596, the first book in the Basque language was edited, entitled Doctrina Christiana en Romance y Bascuence by Dr. Betolaza.In 1602 Bilbao was made the capital of Biscay, a title previously held by Bermeo. Around 1631, the city was the scenario of a series of revolts against the increased taxation on salt, which had been ordered by the Crown, an event locally known as the \"Machinada of the salt\". The revolt ended with the execution of several of its leaders. The city had seen a continuous increase of its wealth, especially after the discovery of extensive iron deposits in the surrounding mountains, and by the end of the century it managed to overcome the economic crises that affected the rest of the kingdom, thanks in part to the increased trading of wool (which now used the port of Bilbao instead of the one in Santander), and to the iron ore and its commerce with England and the Netherlands.\n\n\n=== Contemporary Bilbao ===\n\n\n==== Napoleonic invasion and Carlist wars ====\n\nThe French invasion of Spain saw the occupation of several Basque cities, but Bilbao was not among them. The first open uprising against Napoleonic rule took place on 6 August 1808, a month after the Battle of Bail\u00e9n. French troops sieged and sacked the city, alongside the neighbouring towns of Deusto and Bego\u00f1a on 16 August. Beginning on February 1810, the city was under the command of Pierre Thouvenot, general of the French army and Baron of the Empire, who had become the head of the Military Government of Vizcaya, which included the three Basque provinces. Thouvenot intended to move forward with the plan of total annexation of the Basque provinces into France, but the Peninsular War and ultimately the Battle of Vitoria made those plans impossible.\n\nThe Basque Country was one of the main sites of battles during the First Carlist War, a civil war between supporters of the Spanish regent Maria Christina, known as liberals, and those of the late king's brother Carlos of Borb\u00f3n, known as Carlists. The Carlists were particularly focused on capturing Bilbao, a liberal and economic bastion in northern Spain. The Carlist general Tom\u00e1s de Zumalac\u00e1rregui tried to take the city during the Siege of Bilbao of 1835, but he was wounded during a battle near Bego\u00f1a and died some time after in the town of Zegama. The next year, the city resisted a second siege during which the liberal general Baldomero Espartero defeated the Carlists in the Battle of Luchana. The city was untouched by the Second Carlist War, which took place mostly in Catalonia, but was again an important scenario during the Third Carlist War; in April 1874 the city suffered a third siege which lasted two months.Despite the warfare, Bilbao prospered during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, when it rose as the economic centre of the Basque Country. It was during this time that the railway first arrived to the city and the Bank of Bilbao (which later would go on to become the BBVA) was founded, as well as the Bilbao Stock Exchange. Steelmaking industries flourished with the creation of many new factories, including the Santa Ana de Bolueta and the Altos Hornos de Vizcaya in 1902. The city was modernised with new avenues and walkways, as well as with new modern buildings such as the City Hall building, the Basurto Hospital and the Arriaga Theatre. The population increased dramatically, from 11,000 in 1880 to 80,000 in 1900. Social movements also arose, notably Basque nationalism under Sabino Arana, which in the subsequent decades would grow to become the Basque Nationalist Party.\n\n\n==== Civil war and Francoist dictatorship ====\n\nThe Spanish Civil War started in Bilbao with a number of small uprisings suppressed by the Republican forces. On 31 August 1936, the city suffered its first bombing, with a series of air bombs dropped by Nationalist airplanes. In September, the Nationalists distributed pamphlets threatening further bombing if the city did not give up, which finally took place on 25 September when German planes, in coordination with Francoist forces, dropped at least a hundred bombs on the city. In May 1937, the Nationalist army besieged the town. The battle lasted until 19 June of that year, when Lieutenant Colonel Putz was ordered to destroy all bridges over the estuary, and the troops of the 5th Brigade took the borough from the mountains Malmasin, Pagasarri, and Arnotegi.With the war over, Bilbao returned to its industrial development, accompanied by a steady population growth. In the 1940s, the city was rebuilt, starting with the bridges and by 1948, the first commercial flight took off from the local airport. Over the next decade, there was a revival of the iron industry, which became a strategic industrial sector in Spain, as a consequence of the economic model promoted by the Francoism. The city received migrants from other Spanish regions looking to work in the iron industry. The demand for housing outstripped supply, and workers built slums on the hillsides. It was in this context that the first social movements arose and the strike of the Euskalduna shipyard in 1947 was the first one to take place during the Francoist dictatorship. In this environment of social repression, on 31 July 1959 the terrorist organisation ETA was created as an excision of the Basque nationalist movements. During the decade of 1960 the city was the scenario of several urban projects, with the creation of new neighbourhoods like Otxarkoaga and the motorway to the French border. In June 1968 the public university first arrived to the city with the establishment of the University of Bilbao, which later would be integrated into the University of the Basque Country.\n\n\n==== Democracy and urban renewal ====\n\nAfter the end of Francoist Spain and the establishment of a constitutional monarchy, in a process known in Spain as the transition, Bilbao was able to hold democratic elections again. This time Basque nationalists rose to power. With the approval of the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country in 1979, Vitoria-Gasteiz was elected the seat of the government and therefore the de facto capital of the Basque Autonomous Community, although Bilbao was larger and more powerful economically. In the 1980s, several factors such as labor demands and the arrival of cheap labor from abroad led to a devastating industrial crisis.On 26 August 1983 during the celebration of the local festivities known as Aste Nagusia, the estuary overflowed up to five metres in some areas due to the continuous raining, killing two persons and causing important destructions in the city's infrastructure, with a total economic cost that reached 60,000 million pesetas (around 360 million Euro)Since the mid-1990s, Bilbao has been in a process of deindustrialization and transition to a service economy, supported by investment in infrastructure and urban renewal, starting with the opening of the Bilbao Guggenheim Museum (the so-called Guggenheim effect), and continuing with the Euskalduna Conference Centre and Concert Hall, Santiago Calatrava's Zubizuri, the metro network by Norman Foster, the tram, the Iberdrola Tower and the Zorrozaurre development plan, among others. Many officially supported associations such as Bilbao Metr\u00f3poli-30 and Bilbao R\u00eda 2000 were created to monitor these projects.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nBilbao is located near the northern edge of the Iberian Peninsula, about 16 kilometres (10 mi) from the Bay of Biscay. It covers an area of 40.65 square kilometres (15.70 sq mi), of which 17.35 square kilometres (6.70 sq mi) are urban and the remaining 23.30 square kilometres (9.00 sq mi) consist of the surrounding mountains. The official average altitude is 19 metres (62 ft), although there are measurements between 6 metres (20 ft) and 32 metres (105 ft). It is also the core of the comarca of Greater Bilbao. It is surrounded by the municipalities of Derio, Etxebarri, Galdakao, Loiu, Sondika, and Zamudio to the north; Arrigorriaga and Basauri to the west; Alonsotegi to the south; and Barakaldo and Erandio to the east.\nBilbao is located on the Basque threshold, the range between the larger Cantabrian Mountains and the Pyrenees. The soil is predominantly composed of mesozoic materials (limestone, sandstone, and marl) sedimented over a primitive paleozoic base. The relief of the province is dominated by NW-SE and WNW-ESE oriented folds. The main fold is the anticline of Bilbao which runs from the municipality of Elorrio to Galdames. Inside Bilbao there are two secondary folds, one in the northeast, composed of Mounts Artxanda, Avril, Banderas, Pikota, San Bernab\u00e9, and Cabras; and other in the south, composed of Mounts Kobetas, Restaleku, Pagasarri and Arraiz. The highest point in the municipality is Mount Ganeta, of 689 metres (2,260 ft), followed by Mount Pagasarri, of 673 metres (2,208 ft), both on the border with Alonsotegi.\n\n\n=== Hydrology ===\n\nThe main river system of Bilbao is also the hydrological artery of Biscay. The rivers Nervi\u00f3n and Ibaizabal converge in Basauri and form an estuary named variously \"estuary of Bilbao\", \"of the Nervi\u00f3n\", \"of the Ibaizabal\", or \"of the Nervi\u00f3n-Ibaizabal\". The estuary runs for 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) and with a low flow (with an average of 25 m3 (883 cu ft) per second). Its main tributary is the river Cadagua, which rises in the Mena valley and has a basin of 642 square kilometres (248 sq mi), mostly lying in the neighboring province of Burgos. This river is also the natural border between Bilbao and Barakaldo.\nThe river has frequently suffered from human intervention, as seen in the dredging of its bottom, the building of docks on both banks and especially in the Deusto canal, an artificial waterway dug between 1950 and 1968 in the district of Deusto as a lateral canal, with the aim of facilitating navigation, sparing ships from the natural curves of the estuary. The project was stopped with 400 metres (1,300 ft) left to complete, and it was decided to leave it as a dock. However, in 2007, a plan was approved to continue the canal and form the island of Zorrozaurre. This human intervention has also brought negative results in the quality of the water, after decades of toxic waste dumping causing a situation of anoxia (lack of oxygen), which almost eliminated the entire fauna and flora. However, in recent years this situation is being reversed, thanks to a dumping ban and natural regeneration. now it is possible to observe algae, tonguefishes, crabs, and seabirds, as well as occasional bathers in the summer months.The estuary is also a natural border for several neighbourhoods and districts within the borough. Entering the municipality from the west it separates the districts of Bego\u00f1a and Ibaiondo, then Abando and Uribarri and lastly Deusto and Basurto-Zorroza.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nIts proximity to the Bay of Biscay gives Bilbao an oceanic climate (Cfb), with precipitation occurring throughout the year and without a well-defined dry summer. Precipitation is abundant, and given the latitude and atmospheric dynamics, rainy days represent 45% and cloudy days 40% of the annual total. The rainiest season is between October and April, November being the wettest. Snow is not frequent in Bilbao, although it is possible to see snow on the top of the surrounding mountains. Sleet is more frequent, about 10 days per year, mainly in the winter months. Bilbao is nearest to the subtropical boundary of all the Atlantic coastal cities in the country with an August daily mean of 20.9 \u00b0C (69.6 \u00b0F). There is also a drying trend in summer with only around 50 millimetres (2.0 in) of rainfall in July \u2013 but not dry enough to be considered Mediterranean.\nThe proximity of the ocean also means that the two best defined seasons (summer and winter) remain mild, with low intensity thermal oscillations. Average maximum temperatures vary between 25 and 26 \u00b0C (77.0 and 78.8 \u00b0F) in the summer months, while the average minimum in winter is between 6 and 7 \u00b0C (42.8 and 44.6 \u00b0F).\nExtreme record observations in Bilbao are 42.2 \u00b0C (108.0 \u00b0F) maximum (on 13 August 2003) and  \u22128.6 \u00b0C (16.5 \u00b0F) minimum (on 3 February 1963). The maximum precipitation in a day was 225.6 mm (9 in) on 26 August 1983 when severe flooding was caused by the Nervi\u00f3n river.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAccording to the Basque Statistics Office, the population of Bilbao is 342,397 people as of 2017, distributed on a land area of 40.59 km2 (16 sq mi), making Bilbao the largest city by population of the Basque Autonomous Community and of the Basque Country as a whole. Bilbao makes the main component of the Bilbao metropolitan area, with a population of 1,037,847 people.\nThe first credible data on the population of Bilbao are post-1550. It is known that in 1530 Biscay had approximately 65,000 inhabitants, a number that could have been reduced by plagues that struck the city in 1517, 1530, 1564\u201368, and 1597\u20131601, the last being especially devastating. This trend for periodic reverses in population growth was maintained until the nineteenth century. Since then, Bilbao has experienced an exponential growth in population thanks to industrialisation. After a peak of 433,115 inhabitants in 1982, the municipalities of the Txorierri valley were removed from Bilbao, with the corresponding loss of their population.Spanish is the most spoken language in the city, followed by the vernacular Basque language. According to the city government of Bilbao, at least 51% of the population can speak \"some Basque\", while 29% consider themselves to be fluent.\n\n\n=== Migration ===\nOut of the 355,731 people residing in Bilbao in 2009, only 114,220 (32.1%) were born inside the municipality. Of the remainder, 114,908 were born in other Biscayan towns, while 9,545 were born in the other two Basque provinces; 85,789 came from the rest of Spain (mainly Castile-Le\u00f3n and Galicia), and 33,537 were foreigners. There are 127 different nationalities registered in Bilbao, although 60 of them represent fewer than 10 people each. The largest foreign communities are Bolivians and Colombians, with 4,879 and 3,730 respectively. Other nationalities with more than 1,000 inhabitants are Romanians (2,248), Moroccans (2,058), Ecuadorians (1,832), Chinese (1,390), Brazilians (1,273) and Paraguayans, with 1,204.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nThe city of Bilbao is the capital of the province of Biscay and as such it is home of the administrative entities that pertain to the provincial administration, both from the autonomous and central governments. Settled in the city are the provincial delegations of the different departments of the Basque autonomous government, each coordinated by a representative. In addition, the Government of Spain has the official Government Subdelegation in the city.\n\n\n=== Municipal government ===\n\nBilbao is a municipality and has a mayor-council government system. The municipal government is elected for four-year terms by universal suffrage and it is divided into two branches, executive and legislative. The legislative side consists of a municipal plenum composed of 29 councillors. These councillors represent the different political parties elected in the local elections, for which can vote all residents registered in the city who are citizens of Spain or of any member state of the European Union. The executive branch is composed of the mayor and a board of governors. The number of members of the board cannot be more than a third the number of members of the legislative plenum and the mayor can appoint them at his or her own discretion.Since 1892 the seat of the government has been the Bilbao City Hall, located on the centric Ernesto Erkoreka plaza and by the Estuary of Bilbao. It is the fourth city hall building to have been used since the year 1300. The first three city halls were located by the San Ant\u00f3n Church but were destroyed due to floodings. The current building was designed by the Spanish architect Joaqu\u00edn Rucoba in Baroque style and was built in the former site of the San Agust\u00edn Monastery, which was destroyed during the First Carlist War. Since the Spanish transition to democracy, the city has been governed by the Basque Nationalist Party, often with support of the Socialist Party of the Basque Country. I\u00f1aki Azkuna served as mayor from 1999 until his passing in 2014, when he was replaced by Ibon Areso. Azkuna was awarded the World Mayor prize in 2012. Since the 2019 municipal election, the councillors of the plenum have the following political distribution: 14 seats for the Basque Nationalist Party, 5 seats for the Socialist Party of the Basque Country, 4 seats for the EH Bildu coalition, 3 seats for Udalberri and 3 seats for the People's Party. The mayor is Juan Mari Aburto, chosen with 19 votes from the Basque Nationalist Party and the Socialist party.\nIn 2008 and 2010, Bilbao won the Municipal Transparency Prize, awarded by the Spanish division of Transparency International. In 2009 it came second, after Sant Cugat del Vall\u00e9s.\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nThe municipality is divided into eight districts (Basque: barrutia) which are further subdivided into 34 neighbourhoods (Basque: auzoa). Most of the districts and neighbourhoods were former independent municipalities and elizates that were eventually annexed into the city. Originally, the city of Bilbao comprised the Old Town and some houses on the left side of the estuary, today known as Bilbao la Vieja. The first expansion included the annexation of the elizate of Bego\u00f1a and the river side of Uribarri. In the 19th century the merge of Abando into the city brought along small neighbourhoods of farm houses and hamlets that were clustered close to the former municipality's town hall and the Mount Cobetas, such as Errekalde and Basurto. Starting in the 20th century it started annexing the elizates on the right bank of the river, including Bego\u00f1a and Deusto. In the decade of 1960 as an effort to stop the increasing problem of slums, new neighbourhoods were created from the ground up, among them Otxarkoaga and Txurdinaga, which were joined together as a new district, Otxarkoaga-Txurdinaga in the decade of 1990.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe Bilbao metropolitan area comprises about 47% of the total population of the Basque autonomous community, out of which a 15% is registered in the municipality of Bilbao. The comarca of Greater Bilbao, in which the city occupies a central position, has a GDP per capita of \u20ac30,860, higher than the Spanish and European Union averages. The Bilbao metropolitan area has a nominal GDP amounting to $36,9 billion. Bilbao has been the economic centre of the Basque autonomous community since the original establishment of the Consulate of the Sea in the city in the 16th century, mostly thanks to the commerce in Castilian products on the town's port. It was in the 19th century when the city experimented its biggest economic development, mainly based on the exploitation of the nearby iron mines and siderurgy, both of which promoted maritime traffic and port activity and eventually the development of a very important shipbuilding industry.\n\n\n=== Banking ===\n\nBanking became an important sector with the establishment of the Bank of Bilbao (Spanish: Banco de Bilbao) in 1857 and the Bank of Biscay (Spanish: Banco de Vizcaya) in 1901. These two entities merged in 1988 creating the BBV, which finally merged with Argentaria bank in 1999, creating the current multinational corporation, the BBVA. The savings banks that were established locally, the Municipal Savings Bank of Bilbao (Spanish: Caja de Ahorros Municipal de Bilbao) in 1907 and the Provincial Savings Bank of Biscay (Spanish: Caja de Ahorros Provincial de Vizcaya) in 1921, would merge in 1990 to form the Bilbao Bizkaia Kutxa (BBK), which would marge again in 2012 with other Basque financial entities (Kutxa and Caja Vital Kutxa) to form Kutxabank. There is also the Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Navigation of Bilbao and the Stock Exchange Market of Bilbao, founded in 1890.\n\n\n=== Port ===\n\nThe historical port was located in what is today an area called the Arenal, a few steps from the old city, until the late 20th century. In 1902, an exterior port was built at the mouth of the estuary, in the coastal municipality of Santurtzi. Further extensions to the outer port, which became called \"the super-port\", led to the final move of the city portuary facilities in the 1970s, finally replacing the docks in the centre of the city, with the exception of those located in the neighbourhood of Zorrotza, still active.The port of Bilbao is a first-class commercial port and is among the top five of Spain. Over 200 regular maritime services link Bilbao with 500 ports worldwide. At the close of 2009 cargo movements amounted to 31.6 million tonnes, Russia, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries being the main markets. In the first semester of 2008, it received over 67,000 passengers and 2,770 ships. This activity contributed 419 million euros to the Basque GDP and maintains almost 10,000 jobs.\n\n\n=== Mining and ironworks ===\nIron is the main and most abundant raw material found in Biscay, and its extraction has been legally regulated since 1526. Mining was the main primary activity in Bilbao and the minerals, of great quality, were exported to all over Europe. It was not until the second half of the nineteenth century that an ironworks industry was developed, benefiting from the resources and the city's good communication links. In the 20th century, both Spanish and European capitals imported around 90% of the iron from Biscay. Although World War I made Bilbao one of the main ironworks powers, a subsequent crisis prompted a decline in the activity.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nThe first notion of Bilbao as a tourist destination came with the inauguration of the railway between Bilbao and the coastal neighbourhood of Las Arenas, in the municipality of Getxo in 1872. The connection made Bilbao a minor beach destination.The real tourist surge though would come much later with the inauguration of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in 1997. Thereafter tourist arrivals registered a continued upward trend, reaching over 932,000 visitors in 2018. The trend was exponential considering that in 1995, Bilbao only counted 25,000 tourists. Bilbao also hosts 31% of the total Basque Country visitors, being the top destination of this autonomous community, outranking San Sebasti\u00e1n. The majority of tourists are domestic visitors, coming from Madrid and Catalonia. International travellers are predominantly French, crossing the border just to the east. The others arrive from the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy. Tourism generates about 300 million euros yearly for the Biscayan GDP. Bilbao also draws business tourism, having been equipped with facilities like the Euskalduna Conference Centre and Concert Hall, and the Bilbao Exhibition Centre, in nearby Barakaldo.\n\n\n=== Stock exchange ===\nPlans to create a stock exchange market in Bilbao began in the early 19th century, even though it would not be realized until 21 July 1890. Bilbao's institution is one of the country's four regional stock exchanges, joining Barcelona, Madrid, and Valencia as Spain's commercial centres. It is owned by Bolsas y Mercados Espa\u00f1oles. The Bilbao Stock Exchange is considered a secondary market.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Urban planning ===\n\nIn its beginnings, Bilbao only had three streets (Somera, Artecalle, and Tender\u00eda) surrounded by walls located where Ronda street now stands. Inside this enclosure, there was a small hermitage dedicated to the Apostle Saint James (the current St. James' Cathedral), which pilgrims visited on their way to Santiago de Compostela. In the fifteenth century, four more streets were built, forming the original Zazpikaleak or \"Seven Streets\". In 1571, after several floods and a major fire in 1569, the walls were demolished in order to allow the expansion of the town.In 1861, engineer Amado L\u00e1zaro projected an ensanche inside the then-municipality of Abando with wide avenues and regular buildings, that included the hygienists ideas of the time. The project was mostly based on Barcelona's Eixample, designed by Ildefons Cerd\u00e0. However, the project was dropped by the City Council after considering it \"utopian and excessive\" because of its high cost, though of great quality. Furthermore, L\u00e1zaro had calculated the demographic growth of the town was based on the previous three centuries, a provision that eventually would not conform to reality.The next large urban change in Bilbao would come in 1876, when the capital annexed (in several stages) the neighbouring municipality of Abando. The new ensanche project was planned by a team made of architect Severino de Ach\u00facarro and engineers Pablo de Alzola (elected Mayor that same year), and Ernesto de Hoffmeyer. Unlike L\u00e1zaro's, this project was significantly smaller, compassing 1.58 km2 (0.61 sq mi) against the original 2.54 km2 (0.98 sq mi). It also featured a not so strict grid pattern, a park to separate the industrial and residential areas and the Gran V\u00eda de Don Diego L\u00f3pez de Haro, the main thoroughfare, where many relevant buildings were located, such as the Biscay provincial government hall or the BBVA Tower. By the end of the 1890s, this widening was half completed and already filled, so a new extension was planned by Federico Ugalde.By 1925, the municipalities of Deusto and Bego\u00f1a, as well as part of Erandio were annexed, and in 1940, the remaining part of Erandio became part of Bilbao. The last annexation took place in 1966, with the municipalities of Loiu, Sondika, Derio, and Zamudio. This made Bilbao larger than ever, with 107 km2 (41 sq mi). However, all these municipalities, with the exception of Deusto and Bego\u00f1a regained their independence on 1 January 1983.On 18 May 2010, the government of Singapore awarded Bilbao the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize, at the World Cities Summit 2010. It is considered the Pritzker of urbanism.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nBilbao's buildings display a variety of architectural styles, ranging from gothic, Art Deco, Art Nouveau, Neo-Gothic and contemporary architecture. The Old Town features many of the oldest buildings in the city, as the St. James' Cathedral or the Church of San Ant\u00f3n, included in the borough's coat of arms. Most of the Old Town is a pedestrian zone during the day. Nearby is one of the most important religious temples of Biscay, the Basilica of Bego\u00f1a, dedicated to the patron saint of the province, Our Lady of Bego\u00f1a.\nSeventeen bridges span the banks of the estuary inside the town's boundaries. Among the most interesting ones are the Zubizuri (Basque for \"white bridge\"), a pedestrian footbridge designed by Santiago Calatrava opened in 1997, and the Princes of Spain Bridge, also known as \"La Salve\", a suspension bridge opened in 1972 and redesigned by French conceptual artist Daniel Buren in 2007. The Deusto Bridge is a bascule bridge opened in 1936 and modelled after the Michigan Avenue Bridge, in Chicago. Between 1890 and 1893 the first transporter bridge (\"Puente Colgante\") in the world on the Nervion river, between Portugalete and Getxo, was built by Alberto Palacio (architect and engineer) together with his brother Silvestre.\nSince the deindustrialization process started in the 1990s, many of the former industrial areas are being transformed into modern public and private spaces designed by several of the world's most renowned architects and artists. The main example is the Guggenheim Museum, located in what was an old dock and wood warehouse. The building, designed by Frank Gehry and inaugurated in October 1997, is considered among architecture experts as one of the most important structures of the last 30 years, and a masterpiece by itself. The museum houses part of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation modern art collection. Another example is the Azkuna Zentroa, a wine warehouse built in 1909 and completely redesigned in 2010 by French designer Philippe Starck into a multi-purpose venue that consists of a cinema multiplex, a fitness centre, a library, and a restaurant, among other spaces. The Abandoibarra area is also being renovated, and it features not only the Guggenheim Museum, but also Arata Isozaki's tower complex, the Euskalduna Conference Centre and Concert Hall and the Iberdrola Tower, designed by Argentine architect C\u00e9sar Pelli which is, since its completion in 2011, the Basque Country's tallest skyscraper, 165 metres (541 ft) high. Zorrozaurre is the next area to be redeveloped, following a 2007 master plan designed by Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. This peninsula was transformed into a 500,000 m2 (5,400,000 sq ft) island and will feature residential and commercial buildings, as well as the new BBK seat.\n\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\n\nAs of 2010, Bilbao has 18 public parks inside its limits, totalling 200 ha (490 acres) of green spaces. Furthermore its green belt has a total area of 1,025 ha (2,530 acres), of which 119 ha (290 acres) are urbanized. The largest parks are Mount Cobetas, of 18.5 ha (46 acres), and Larreagaburu, of 12 ha (30 acres), both located on the outskirts.The Do\u00f1a Casilda Iturrizar park is located in the district of Abando, near the town centre and covers an area of 8.5 ha (21 acres). It is named after a local benefactress who donated the grounds to the borough. It is an English-style garden designed by Ricardo Bastida and opened to the public in 1907. It features a dancing water fountain surrounded by a pergola, and a pond with many species of ducks, geese and swans, which gives the park the alternate name of \"Ducks' Park\", as known locally. In recent years, it was expanded to be connected with the Abandoibarra area. In Ibaiondo, the Etxeberria Park was built in the 1980s in the place where a steel mill previously stood. The original chimney was maintained as a homage of its industrial past. It covers an area of 18.9 ha (47 acres), on a sloped terrain that overlooks the Old Town. Other relevant public spaces inside the city include the Europa Park, the Miribilla Park, or the Memorial Walkway, a 3 km (1.9 mi) long walkway, with 12 m (39 ft) high lamps, located in the left bank of the estuary and that connects the main sights.Mount Artxanda is easily accessible from the town centre by a funicular. There is a recreational area at the summit, with restaurants, a sports complex and a balcony with panoramic views. In the south, Mount Pagasarri receives hundreds of hikers every weekend since the 1870s, who seek its natural wonders. Its environment is officially protected since 2007.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nBilbao was appointed a \"City of Design\" by UNESCO in 2014 and has been part of the Creative Cities Network since then.\n\n\n=== Theaters ===\n\nThe main hall of the city is the Arriaga Theater, reopened in 1985 as a municipal venue with a varied repertoire that includes dancing, opera, live music and theatre. Also very active are the Campos El\u00edseos Theater and the Euskalduna Concert Hall. Other important venues include La Fundici\u00f3n, dedicated to contemporary dances and theatre; the Pabell\u00f3n 6, the Sala BBK and the Azkuna Zentroa.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nBilbao has more than a dozen museums covering a range of fields including art, science, and sport, which have played a central role in Bilbao being named one of the most creative cities in the world.The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, part of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, was inaugurated on 19 October 1997 and is work of the Canadian architect Frank Gehry. The museum's permanent collection is centered in the visual arts of the second half of the 20th century and the present, with relevant artworks from Richard Serra and Jeff Koons, although including as well temporary exhibitions with a more varied nature, like Russian art or engravings from Albrecht D\u00fcrer.Another important museum is the Bilbao Fine Arts Museum, first established in 1908 and housing a notable collection of Spanish and European work from the 12th century to present times. The collection from before the 20th century is centered mainly around Spanish and Flemish artists such as El Greco, Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n, Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo, Francisco Goya and Anthony van Dyck. The museum also holds one of the best collections of Basque art, with works from the 19th century to present times. It has an eye-catching collection of Avant-garde art, from the Post-Impressionism of Paul Gauguin to Pop art and the expressionism of Francis Bacon.\nThe Basque Museum showcases Basque archaeology and ethnography, and holds frequent exhibitions in the area of Basque history. The museum building itself is part of the heritage listing Conjunto hist\u00f3rico. The city also has several specialised museums, like the Maritime Museum Estuary of Bilbao (Bilboko Itsasadarra Itsas Museoa), located next to the Estuary of Bilbao, which holds ships and other collection related to the region's fishing and shipbuilding culture, being particularly relevant the Carola crane, last remaining element of the Euskalduna shipyard that existed where the museum now stands.\nOther relevant museums are the Biscayan Archeological Museum (Arkeologi Museoa) which holds important collections related to the region's prehistory, and the Diocesan Museum of Religious Art (Eleiz Museoa), both located in the Casco Viejo quarter.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nThe Euskalduna Concert Hall is home to frequent musical performances and it is home of the Bilbao Symphony Orchestra (Bilbao Orkestra Sinfonikoa) and the opera season programmed by the ABAO (Bilbao Association of Friends of the Opera). The Arriaga Theater is frequently the host of numerous musical events, other notable stages include the Philharmonic Society of Bilbao (chamber music) and Bilborock (pop and rock music). The city hosts many different musical festivities, often funded by the city hall. Due to its scope, it is especially relevant the Bilbao BBK Live festival, which has been celebrated every year since 2006 and focuses on Basque, Spanish and international pop and rock music. Since the opening of the new San Mam\u00e9s Stadium in 2013, it has been often used as an open-air concert venue, the first ever concert being one from the American band Guns N'Roses in 2017. Other relevant music festivals include the Bilbao Distrito Jazz and the Bilbao Ars Sacrum, the latter dedicated to religious music.\nBilbao is the birthplace of famous composer Juan Cris\u00f3stomo Arriaga, who lived his formative years in the city before moving to Paris at age 15. Also native from Bilbao were the soprano singer Josefa Cruz de Gassier and Natividad \u00c1lvarez, nicknamed Nati, la bilbainita (Spanish for \"Nati, the little one from Bilbao\") a dancer and castanets player who achieved national fame in the early 20th century. Also relevant is the Bilbao Choir Society (Bilboko Koral Elkartea), established in 1866. Important musical bands coming from the city include rock band Fito & Fitipaldis, Basque folk band Oskorri and folk-pop band Mocedades.\nBilbao hosted the 2018 MTV Europe Music Awards.\n\n\n=== Festivals and events ===\n\nBilbao hosts several regular festivals and events. The most relevant is the Big Week of the city (Aste Nagusia), celebrated annually since 1978 and lasting nine days. It is the city's main festival, attracting over 1,500,000 people every year. The festivities begin on the first Saturday before 22 August, and during those nine days the city hall organises a series of cultural events of diverse kind, including concerts, stage plays, Basque rural sports and bullfighting, as well as nightly firework displays. The festivities begin with the chupinazo or txupinazo, which is the launch of a small rocket, and the reading of a proclamation by the festivities' herald. The central point of the festivities is the place around the txosnas, where the different konpartsak are reunited, organised by neighbourhood associations as well as cultural, social and political groups. The symbol of the festivities is Marijaia, a large doll which is burned during the last day of celebrations.\nBeyond the main festivities of the Aste Nagusia, the city also celebrates some minor festivities, many of them religious in nature, such as Saint Agatha on 5 February, the celebrations of Our Lady of Bego\u00f1a on 11 October, the Day of Thomas the Apostle on 21 December and the Christmas festivities, centered around the figure of Olentzero. There are also festivities in the different neighbourhoods and districts which are celebrated locally, such as the Fiestas del Carmen in Santutxu and Indautxu, Fiestas Santiago in Bilbao la Vieja, Fiestas San Ignacio in San Inazio and Fiestas San Roque in Arxtanda and Larraskitu.\nThe city also hosts the International Festival of Documentary and Short Film under the commercial name of Zinebi. It was first held in 1959 under the name International Festival of Ibero-American and Filipino Documentary Film of Bilbao, with the goal of being complementary to the San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival. Since 1981 it is organised by the city hall and takes place in the Arriaga Theatre. Bilbao is also the host of the SAIL in Festival, a yearly event centered exclusively around sailing, which brings together international representatives of this sport.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nTraditional Bilbao dishes are centered around products from the sea and the estuary, such as eels and cod. For the most part Bilbao shares its original gastronomy with that of the province of Biscay, including dishes such as bacalao al pil pil (cod fish cooked with olive oil, garlic and guindilla peppers), bacalao a la vizca\u00edna (salted cod with Biscayan sauce, mostly made of choricero peppers and onions), merluza en salsa verde (hake fish with green sauce), chipirones en su tinta (squid served with its own ink), morros a la vizca\u00edna (beef snouts with Biscayan sauce), revuelto de perretxikos (scrambled eggs with mushrooms) and desserts such as canutillos de Bilbao (puff pastries filled with custard or chocolate), Pantxineta (puff pastries filled with custard and almonds), rice cakes and bollos de mantequilla (butter buns).\nBilbao, as other Basque cities, is known for a variety of appetizers and snacks, being prominent among them the pintxos, which are typically eaten in bars and that consist of small slices of bread on top of which is placed an ingredient or mixture of ingredients, generally of many different types and usually including elements typical of Basque cuisine. Other snacks include rabas (fried or battered calamari rings, usually served with lemon slices), Spanish omelette (omelette made with eggs and potatoes, sometimes including onions and peppers), txampis (stuffed mushrooms), tri\u00e1ngulos (Bilbao-style sandwiches), gildas (one or more olives, a guindilla pepper and an anchovy joined together with a toothpick).\nIn what refers to beverages, typical from the region is the txakoli, a white wine usually drunk as an ap\u00e9ritif. Biscayan txakoli (Bizkaiko Txakolina) is a protected Denominaci\u00f3n de origen for the white wine produced in the province of Biscay and it is usually served in Bilbao. Also typical are cider, patxaran (sloe-flavoured liqueur) and Rioja wine.\nThere are many restaurants and bars who serve these dishes and beverages, especially around the Casco Viejo quarter. Txokos are also a very popular institution in Bilbao, as in other Basque cities and towns. Bilbao, and the province of Biscay as a whole, is one of the spanish cities with a greater number of recognized restaurants by the gastronomic guides, among them several Michelin-starred restaurants.\n\n\n=== Language ===\nThe Spanish language is the most used language of the city, followed by the Basque language, which is vernacular to the region. The presence of Basque in the city is less prominent than in other municipalities of the region, such as Bermeo or Lekeitio. In 1986, the bilingual Basque-speaking population represented about 28% of the total. However, the number of Basque speakers has experienced a continuous increase since, reaching a number of 37% in 2001. More than half of the Basque speakers were younger than 30 and lived in the districts of Deusto, Bego\u00f1a and Abando.According to the data from the 2016 census, the population older than 2 years old registered in the municipality of Bilbao who speaks fluently represents 29% of the total population, while those who can speak it with difficulty represent around 19.95% of the total. Finally, those who cannot speak or understand the language represent the remaining 51.06% of the census.",

      "name": "Church of Saint Anthony the Great",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Church of San Ant\u00f3n is a Catholic temple located in the Old Town neighbourhood of Bilbao, Spain. It is dedicated to Anthony the Great, known as San Ant\u00f3n in Spanish. It is featured, along with the San Ant\u00f3n Bridge, in the city's coat of arms. The estuary of Bilbao flows next to it.\n\n\n== Introduction ==\nThe Gothic style is an artistic style of the 15th and 16th centuries. The great majority of those centuries' buildings have deteriorated with the passing of time and have been reconstructed. Consequently, they do not support the same Gothic essence anymore. Nevertheless, in buildings such as Saint Anthony's church, even though it has been reconstructed, it is possible to observe some Gothic features as the rib vaults and the pointed arches.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe church was built at the end of the 15th century on a plot where there had been a years a warehouse for three hundred years. It is considered an asset of cultural interest since 17 July 1984, in the category \"National Historic-Artistic Monument\".\n\nIn 1300 Diego L\u00f3pez de Haro gave the municipal charter. The river and the plot were incorporated to the new village called Bilbao. Some claim that  in 1334 Alfonso XI of Castile ordered to build a fortress and wall that were used like a dike against the flood. A wall was discovered in 2002 by an archaeological excavation but the claim is still inconclusive.\nSome time later this two buildings were replaced by one church dedicated to Saint Anton Abbot. This church was consecrated in 1433. In that moment the church only has one nave with a rectangular floor and a vaulted roof. Nowadays we can see the old foundations of that church near the old wall of Bilbao.\n\nIn 1478 they start a new project to increase the church, because it was very small and the congregation of faithful people was increasing. This enlargement, in Gothic style, was finished in the first part of the 16th century.\nThroughout history this church has suffered a lot of damages and was closed two times. The main source of damage was the Nervi\u00f3n river because the church is very close to it. A lot of flooding happened during the history and a part of the furniture inside was affected by it. The last flood was in 1983 and it affected the church; it destroyed furniture, drag doors and railings.\nDuring the war the bombing and fire the church suffer a lot of damages. Especially during the Carlist war. Caused by this war the church had to close because it was used like warehouse of management. The second time when Saint Anton had to close was in 1881. This was caused by the tumbledown state of the church. This restoration done by Sabino Goikoetxea was very polemic because he change a lot of original things.\n\n\n== Gothic art in Biscay ==\n\nGothic art was created in France in the 13th century, but it is not until the 14th century when it was introduced in Biscay, due to the poverty. In the 14th century the population and the economy grew, carrying the Gothic into Biscay.\n\nThe ogival art or Gothic art was born in France, and it was extended to the rest of Europe. In Spain the ogival architecture is used a half century later than in France. As the French influence entered by Navarre, it avoided the Basque Country, so it was even later when it came to Biscay. Most of the buildings are not really big, even if we can find Santiago's cathedral in Bilbao or Andra Mari of Lekeitio.\nThe Gothic architecture, with its ogival arches (that is why it is also called ogival architecture), was what they needed in Biscay. This arches needed an exterior backing, which began in the wall. The concentric arches became peaked and ogival, instead of the half-pointed arches. They were adorned with vegetal, zoomorphic or human representations. The vaults began being as simple-ribbed but finally they were used terceletes.\nMost of the buildings were begun in the 14th century, but only Santiago's cathedral was ended then. The rest were consecrated between the 15th and 16th centuries.\nThe Biscay Gothic lost the spirit of the International Gothic: they were not monumental buildings with windows which played with the light creating a mystical aura inside, but small buildings, becoming that a characteristic of the local Gothic.\nAndra Mari of Guernica, Getxo, Ordu\u00f1a, Gue\u00f1es, Erandio, Galdakao, Portugalete and Lekeitio, Santa Eufemia of Bermeo, Santiago's Cathedral, Basilica of Bego\u00f1a, San Vicente and San Anton of Bilbao and San Severino of Balmaseda have to be named as important buildings of the Gothic of  Biscay.\n\n\n== Chapels of San Ant\u00f3n ==\nThe Church of San Ant\u00f3n contains three chapels:\n\n\n=== Chapel of Provost ===\nIt is the first and widest chapels that the Church of San Ant\u00f3n possesses. Built in 1530 this chapel is an example of the late Gothic style which can be seen in other nearby construction like Bego\u00f1a, La encarnaci\u00f3n, San Vicente of Abando and San Pedro of Deusto. There is a big ogival arch at the entrance of the chapel. This arch is closed by a grille that was forged in Bilbao. At the top of the entrance it is located this chapels founder's coat of arms: the Lezama-Leguizam\u00f3n family's coat of arms. In the past there was a passageway that linked this chapel and Lezama-Leguizam\u00f3n family's tower house. There is a stained glass window located in the front wall.\n\nThe chapel held two altarpieces. One of the altarpieces is dedicated to Santa Ana and the other is dedicated to Virgen de la Consolaci\u00f3n. At present the chapel contains an altar that contains a wood carved sculpture of Inmaculada and some paintings.\nThere is also a silver lamp with the following inscription carved on it: \"Esta l\u00e1mpara dieron a su capilla de Santa Ana, Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda de Leguizam\u00f3n y Don Domingo de Isasi-Leguizam\u00f3n. 1621\"\n\n\n=== Chapel of Piety ===\nThe Chapel of Piety is smaller than the Chapel of Provost but bigger than the Chapel of San Roque. It possesses similar attributes of those present in the Chapel of Provost. It has a Gothic structure in the entrance arch, rib vault on the ceilings and stained glass windows.\nThe grille closing this chapel is older than the grille closing the Chapel of Provost. The top part of this grille includes the coat of arms of the Recalde family along with details of The Passion.\nThe intermediate frieze contains the following inscription written in Latin: \"O Mater Dei, memento mei Iesu\". It could be translated as \"Oh mother of god, remember us before Jesus\".\nIn 1919 the Chapel of Provost and the Chapel of Piety were united with a Gothic arch to enlarge the communion rail.\n\n\n=== Chapel of San Roque ===\nIt's the smallest chapel out of the three that the church of San Anton possess. This chapel is composed by a rib vault and a small blinded Gothic window in the right wall. It was the first entrance of the church.\nWhen the new main front was built the Ibiceta family which had their family sepulchre in the chapel decided to transform it to an artistic mausoleum with prayerful sculptures and diverse decorative elements. The chapel contains a round-headed arch sustained by Corinthians columns.\nAt present days there are present in this chapel the sculpture of San Roque above the sepulture and the sculptures of Santa Lucia and San Sebastian flanking it.\n\n\n== Fa\u00e7ade of Renaissance ==\n\nThe Saint Anthon church, in Bilbao, contains a typical front, not of the own and general style of the church, which is the Gothic, but of the Renaissance style born in the 16th century. This owes to the repeated reforms to which the church has been submitted, and every reform has contributed something new and characteristic of that epoch.\nTo begin with, it is necessary to emphasize that there exist features that belong neither to the Renaissance nor to the Gothic. Example of it we have the arches of the entry. These arches are called round arches and are typical of the Romanesque style; and at the door there is another type of arch that was used at the end of the 15th century.\nA really Gothic and visible element from any point of view, are the rib vaults, that are in the whole church, so much in as externally, though in this paragraph we indicate only the ones outside.\nIn the front we find the front of the church, a front that goes from the sides of the door up to being over it. The mentioned front was built in the year 1548, a generous front in proportions and rich in all the decorative resources of the Renaissance. Around the arch we notice small sculptures of low relief, with the form of heads, symbol of the anthropocentrism that dominated the Renaissance epoch. The great majority of the heads contain wings of angels behind them; and just in the middle of all, in the central keystone, we notice a slightly bigger sculpture than the others, with the form of a shield, and with the year 1548 recorded in it, as a signature of the builder.\nIn every side of the door we can see another typical example of the Renaissance, which was the use of Corinthian columns. Those which appear in this church are of small size in comparison with other buildings, but they support all their essence: a Corinthian capital with its rectangular annulet and abacus and its acanthus' leaves, some coiled forming \"caul\u00edculos\". The shaft we find it in grooved style and the end of the shaft and the foot we can see it with sculptural drawings of plants (basically leaves) and human representations.\nAnd to finish with the front, as we can observe in this image,we find two niches, one to each side of the door, which until 1892 were empty, and that from that year's reform, the sculptures of Saint Pedro and Saint Paul went to occupy them.\nThe niches contain scallops, which are the space of the niche itself, with representations that venerate what is inside the niche. In this case we also find in the scallop two little angels holding a medallion with the head of another human being.\nAll these elements (niches, angels, scallops, medallions, Corinthian columns) are representative elements of the Renaissance style of the 15th and 16th centuries; all of them have as canon to represent the beauty and the naturalism, and all of them shape the great front of the Saint Anthon church of Bilbao.\n\n\n== Belfry Tower ==\n\nIn 1774 the construction of the Belfry Tower began by Gabriel de Capelastegui. This one had to substitute the former one. The tower has a quadrangular body that raises near the central roof. Above it we can find the belfry crowned by a dome and a lantern, and with aunctions in the weathercock. It has a shining Baroque dieciochesco style, being one of the best examples of the whole Basque Country. The weathercock dates back of in 1775, concretely it was made on 7 December that year.\nWe get to the belfry going up the 106 limestone stairs and its banister, which has a surprising geometric precision. From the base to the lantern there are 32 wooden steps, that need to be repaired.\nEven if from the four eyes of the tower you can have wonderful panoramics, it is true that from the lantern they enlarge. That is why, doting it of a better and more secure access would be convenient, to allow more people to see what probably is the best view of the city.\nThe outside watch was ubicated in this lantern, with bronze sphere and golden numbers, it was situated between the two coats of arms made of bronze in the consulate balcony, in front of the Mercado de la Ribera.\nThe bell, substituted the one before, The Circumcision of the Lord, which fell on 29 June 1779. The actual one has the following inscription: \"IHS. San Antonio Abad. Ora pro nobis, Antonio de la Hoza me Hizo. 1829.\"\nThe last contributions date from 1902: the new portico in front of the Ronda street, the new sacristy and the large parroquial dependences.\nThe construction of the portico and the frontages which run until the bridge are a good decision of its architect, Enrique Epalza, for making them in Isabelline Gothic, avoiding like this to oppose to the temples style.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nEl g\u00f3tico: arte de la Baja Edad Media / Mar\u00eda del Carmen Mu\u00f1oz; Gonzalo M.

In 2009 the Basque Government announced the possibility of connecting the then under construction line 3 with the future line 4 at Matiko, thus extending the line 4 from Errekalde to Matiko via Moyua and two additional stations, one by the Do\u00f1a Casilda Iturrizar park and another one by the campus of the University of Deusto. This project would have involved the renovation of Moyua station to hold the new platforms and tracks.The line however stayed as a mere project, and in 2017 the Basque Government announced that any type of construction work could not begin before 2020 due to the lack of resources, a problem that also affected the line 5 project to Galdakao.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The Vizcaya Bridge (Bizkaiko Zubia in Basque, Puente de Vizcaya in Spanish) is a transporter bridge that links the towns of Portugalete and Las Arenas (part of Getxo) in the Biscay province of Spain, crossing the mouth of the Nervion River.\nPeople in the area, and even the official website, commonly call it the Puente Colgante (literally \"hanging bridge\", used for suspension bridge in Spanish), although its structure is quite different from a suspension bridge.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Vizcaya Bridge was built to connect the two banks which are situated at the mouth of the Nervion River. It is the world's oldest transporter bridge and was built in 1893, designed by Alberto Palacio, one of Gustave Eiffel's disciples. The Engineer Ferdinand Joseph Arnodin was in charge, and the main financier of the project was Santos Lopez de Letona. It was the solution given by the engineer to the problem of connecting the towns of Portugalete and Getxo without disrupting the maritime traffic of the Port of Bilbao and without having to build a massive structure with long ramps. Palacio wanted to design a bridge which could transport passengers and cargo, and that could allow ships to go through. Palacio's shuttle bridge was adequate and could be built for a reasonable price.\nThe service was only interrupted once, for four years, during the Spanish Civil War, when the upper section was dynamited. From his house in Portugalete, Palacio saw his masterpiece partially destroyed just before his own death.\n\n\n== Universal Heritage ==\nOn July 13, 2006, the Vizcaya Bridge was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. In Spain, it is the only monument in the Industrial Heritage category. UNESCO considers the bridge to be a perfect combination of beauty and functionality. It was the first to use a combination of iron technology and new steel cables which began a new form of constructing bridges which was later imitated throughout the world.\n\n\n== Operation ==\n\nThe bridge, still in use, is 164 meters long, and its gondola can transport six cars and several dozen passengers in one and a half minutes.\nIt operates every 8 minutes during the day (every hour at night), all year round, with different fares for day and night services, and is integrated into Barik card system. An estimated four million passengers and half a million vehicles use the bridge annually.There are two new visitor lifts installed in the 50-metre-high pillars of the bridge that allow walking over the bridge's platform, from where there is a view of the port and the Abra bay.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe structure is made of four 61 metre towers which are the pillars and stand on the river banks. The towers are braced by iron cables to the crossbeam and are parallel to the river and by cables following the line of the bridge into the hill behind (on the Portugalete side) and the ground (on the Las Arenas side). The upper crossbeam which lies horizontally, rests between two towers by 70 suspension cables. They also help support a great amount of weight and are supported in the corbels which helps balance the weight. The gondola transports vehicles and they hang from a 36-wheeled caty and is 25m. long. It moves along the rails through the horizontal crossbeam.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nThe structure is 45 metres high and 160 metres long. In the final design they decided to use two horizontal girders to support the rails, and these are supported by four pillars which stand on four towers which are situated on the river banks. It is made of iron. Much iron was extracted from the mines of Vizcaya, which increased the mining and shipping industry. Therefore, the Vizcaya Bridge also represents the growth and triumph of a new era.\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttp://www.puente-colgante.com\nTourism in the Basque Country\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20070211071228/http://www.guiabizkaia.com/gbilbao/portu/Index.html\nUNESCO World Heritage Official Site with the Vizcaya Bridge profile\nPortugalete Transporter Bridge at Structurae\nPuente Vizcaya",

          "I saw that there was a bridge driving around Getxo, but the discovery of the fact that was the first in the world and from more than 130 years ago, the ingenuity of the engineer that built it....and the fact that works so nicely and crossing with it to the other side is so",
          "This is a great feat of engineering and well worth the trip to see. This is the world's first transporter bridge, which opened in 1883. The bridge links Portugalete to Getxo. You are able to travel very cheaply using the transporter (45 cents) either as a foot passenger or car",
          "The bridge was designed by the Eiffel's student. I highly recommend to pay for the ticket and take a lift 15 floors up where you can see the views of the area. And then take a gondola - a ferry attached to the bridge which goes under it - to go to the other side of the town:",
          "A wonderful piece of man made construction from industrial revolution era. Well maintained till date. Used by many to cross over river. U can take an elevator and go right on top to have an wonderful view. Must visit to have a different experience.",

          "We took the metro to Getxo. Toured around, had a fabulous lunch at The Willows, then walked to the bridge and crossed on it using the Barik card. We purchased one Barik card which up to 10 people can use. It is easier and cheaper to use this card. Get it at the Metro stations,",
          "Built in 1893 to allow large ships to sail all the way to Bilbao and locals to cross over the river at its opening easily the moving bridge still operates though large vessels now anchor at the Bay of Biscay. It was designed by one of Gustav Eiffels disciples Alberto del Palecio",

          "As other reviewers mentioned, this is one of very few transporter bridges remaining in the world. It still operates efficiently. It transports pedestrians, cars, bicyclists across the bay. Cost to ride the gondola is 0.40 Euros for pedestrians and takes less than 5 minutes.",
          "Interesting industrial bridge, one of a few remaining ones left in the world of the kind. It was justly declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Very cheap to cross the river and nice picture opportunities.",

          "We spent most of a day working our way down from Algorta metro stop, through the shops, then via the beach, then aquarium, then paseo looking at the mansions, ending up at the bridge on the Getxo side which is really cool. We got a lift up to walk across the top - it is totally",
          "We used the bridge to cross the river at the estuary outside Bilbao. It is a very unusual suspension bridge that physically moves the bridge across a suspended pulley system. Worth the effort to get there.",

          "We were staying in Bilbao and used the metro to get to Getxo . We then crossed the bridge and returned on the other line from Portugalete ( about 1.5 euro each way ). It is well worth the trip to see this magnificent structure. If you get chance the seafront at Portugalete side",
          "We are so glad we made the effort to jump on the Metro in Bilbao for the 30 min journey to Benoto or Portugalete stations to see this unique attraction. Jump on the suspended \"Gondola transport\" and ride across and back. It's great fun for all the family. If you travel by foot",

This was well worth the small sum involved but the trip up in the lift and taking the walkway across",

          "A must see around Bilbao. The area around is also very nice for a walk. Easily accesible by subway plus walk in about 30 min from Bilbao center.",
          "The Vizcaya bridge is definitely worth a visit/crossing. The bridge itself was built just like the Eiffel Tower and resembels it a lot. One can either use the elevator to the top and then cross the bridge over a footpath almost in the clouds or use the FERRY, which transports",
          "We got the metro to Portugalete and it was 8 euro each to walk across the top (very safe) and get the gondola back. The elevator ride to the top is good and the walk across gives great views and shows the industry around this area. It also has information regarding the bridge",
          "The Viscaya Bridge, built in 1893, is a transporter/suspension bridge across the Nervion River near Bilbao, Spain. We were informed that it was inspired by the achievements of Gustave Eiffel. Although we did not take a ride across the river, we were able to witness it in",
          "This is an incredible feat of engineering. Built in the late 19th Century by one of the students/colleagues of Eiffel, this bridge bears all the hallmarks of that relationship. The bridge ironwork looks much like Eiffel's tower, and the mechanism of moving the platform across",

          "This bridge is not so far from the place I live. If you are not frightened of high places, do not hesitate to cross it through the top part. The views from it are wonderfull",
          "We crossed the bridge in a car through the transport system which was an interesting experience. The bridge isn't that pretty at night since it doesn't have any lighting",
          "Interesting from the technical and architecture point of view. Inscribed onto the World Heritage List of UNESCO. Built by the end of the 19th century. Because banks of the river are not high above water level, a traditional bridge would make passage of ships to and from Bilbao",
          "I've seen a lot of strange bridges, but this tops it all ! The \"hanging\" service transports even the cars etc., but the kick comes from crossing walking on top (elevators will bring you there )",
          "It is on of the only two hanging iron bridges in Europe. Interesting, but that is all. It is functioning and you can cross the river in it by car.",
          "Hop on a metro either blue line 2 (Kabiezes) or red line 1 (Plentzia). We travelled on the blue line, got off in Portugalete. Head down to the Nervion river, while enjoying the ambience of the town. After watching the transporter do its thing, very interesting technology, we",
          "Extraordinary bridge crossing the river. Best \u20ac0,40 I've ever spent. If you're in Getxo you need to check this Bridge.",
          "You take a lift up to the top walk across and then get back across using the carrier which goes along the river. The area surrounding it isn't the nicest and its slightly removed from the centre but you can get the tube there quite direct. If you're in Bilbao for more than a day",
          "when you visit bilbao you need to be here impressive views from the top of the bridge very secure then when you cross the other side you can enjoy lot of activities ,restaurants ,the city and small shops with suveneirs,this is a monument of unesco need to see,Bilbao have good",
          "This magnificent structure was just in front of my hotel and was the only way I could see to get across the water. As a foot passenger it was a minimal charge of \u20ac0.40 each way. There wasn't a long wait for a return journey either as it crosses back and forth every five minutes",
          "We walked here from the Cruise terminal in Getxo - it's a pleasant 20-30 minute walk along the promenade. This structure is quite fascinating - especially when you consider the age of it. We bought a tourist ticket in the gift shop there, which enabled us to walk over the top",
          "It is cool to look at it from afar. However, on it, the views are not that great. The walking portion on top is just a way to make money, I would not recommend spending the nearly seven euros to walk across. Not that special.",
          "This bridge was apparently the first transporter bridge in the world and is still functioning now, ferrying people and cars from Portugalete to Getxo. It's an impressive structure and a wonderfully convenient way to cross the estuary, especially for only 40c. There was a lift",
          "I'd never heard of this bridge, but am so grateful that our hotel suggested visiting it. It's a brilliant piece of 19th century engineering and quite unlike anything else I've seen. We went out on the Metro to the south side, crossed over and walked along the Getxo sea front",
          "The historical transporter bridge is very imposing and looks great on both sides of the river. It's only costs about 60c and a few minutes of your time to cross and gives you great views of Portugalete and Getxo. I would say it's a must to visit while in Bilbao as it's only a 30",
          "This is a transporter bridge that crosses the river and transport people and cars using the gondola. The bridge is made of iron/steel. You can use the elevator to go up the bridge and cross the river on walk and enjoy the view.",

          "The highlight of my trip. Firstly I travelled over the bridge from Portugalete to Getxo in my car. We then purchased tickets for the high level walkway which also included the return trip as a foot passenger on the gondola. The history of the bridge, in English, French, Basque",
          "It's very impressive. When you walked on the bridge, jus like you back to the history. I took lots of pics on the bridge. If you were there, you won't miss it.",

          "Easy to reach from central Bilboa on the Metro (Areeta is easier than Portugalette), and free if you have a Bilbao Bizkaia card. This for me was one of the highlights of the trip. The views from the top of the bridge were great and the plaques explaining about the bridge were",
          "What a weird contraption! I initially spent some time just watching it in motion, before I crossed it by the moving platform (using my public transport card) and later paid the hefty fee to walk across. It did not disappoint, although I was very hesitant to take pictures up",
          "Looking for a day trip, got great advice from tourist information. Train to Potugalete, stroll with the bridge in front of you, great lunch in the town ( venture in don't stop at the first places you come too) then a crossing for 40 cents. Great walk up to Getxo and a metro back",
          "If possible, visit the bridge on a sunny day. However, even if the sun doesn't shine, the views are absolutely beautiful.",
          "Went to see this Unesco world heritage site while on our way from Bilbao to Getxo. Pretty awesome sights from above. You can see to the water through the floor above, so probably not for the ones who are afraid of heights. Walked to the other side and then took the gondola back.",
          "So, you can visit the top part of the bridge and enjoy the view and read the story of the bridge. The same ticket will also allow you to make a one way trip on the transporter! Very different from anything I've ever seen! Worth the while if you're looking for something",

          "This is a very unique bridge and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is definitely worth paying to go on the tour although I don't know that the audio tour is worth it. The views from above are incredible and the tour includes a ride back on the gondola/ferry.",
          "Fast and easy to go up. First you go by lift, then you can cross by foot all the bridge on top, after you can come back to your side by the transbordador. Suggest for the construction and the views!",

          "This bridge is definitely worth seeing if you're in the area but I'm not sure if it's worth crossing. Well, as there are two sides to the river there are two sides to this bridge. If you travel in the gondola that hangs below it's an unusual way to cross a riverand very",
          "A really interesting visit from the historical point of view. Impressive panoramic view of the anthropically modified estuary of Nervi\u00f3n-Ibaizabal. Unfortunately, the visit is too short for the ticket price (7\u20ac). Anyway, you cannot miss it.",

          "This bridge is really incredible and it is worth going to the top to see the city of Bilbao as well as Portugalete, Santurzi and Getxo. I didn't do the audioguide and was happy to go at my own pace. I'm definitely afraid of heights and as the hanging part crossed the bridge it",
          "This is the oldest transporter bridge in the world and a unesco heritage site. Use the metro pas to get across the river (1 euro) to experience the bridge. Going up on the lift to walk across sets you back 9 Euro. Worth a visit.",
          "Wonderful way to get to the ferry port from the town of Getxo if you want to avoid an overnight in central Bilbao Great feat of engineering and it always seems to be operating Cheap and efficient !",
          "Very specific river crossing design this bridge! not easy to find. The crossing itself (few euro's per car + 0.40 euros per person) is funny and really fast! I would recommend paying the fee to be able to walk OVER the steel support structure of the bridge, we just crossed it",
          "Amazing piece of engineering that should not be missed. I recommend taking the lift all the way up to cross the bridge on foot - great views and excellent commentary on the history and technology of the bridge",
          "A curiosity from a bygone age, I would not make a journey to see it, but if you're nearby it's worth a look. Perhaps I missed something, but I didn't see much in the way of commentary and explanation.",

          "This UNESCO World Heritage site is well worth the visit if you are in Bilbao. For 7 Euros you can ascend to the top and walk across reading about the history of the area and the bridge with the most amazing views. We went from the Getxo side to Portugalete and had a pleasant",
          "On our way into Bilbao from the airport, our taxi driver told us we must visit the Vizcaya Bridge before leaving the area. We didn't know what he was talking about but asked around and learned it is an unusual 19th-century structure that ferries people and cars across the deep",
          "If you're staying in Bilbao for a few days then it's really well worth catching the Metro Red Line to Areeta to visit this bridge,cross offer and enjoy a few drinks and pinxtos on the other side. It's a fascinating piece of engineering and if you're okay with heights the views",
          "Where else could you visit a UNESCO World Heritage site for .40? That is the cost of a one-way ride on the hanging bridge. You buy your ticket at the machine and scan it to enter the waiting area. It is a nice experience.",
          "We were in Bilbao on a cruise ship and got drawn back to this fantastic piece of 1890s engineering even though we had been previously. We approached it from Portugalete side, having taken the Metro there and had lunch before going to the bridge. It is quite breathtaking when",
          "We just were amazed at the design of the bridge that was ahead of its time and still functioning--purpose was to transport people and cars across the river without interrupting maritime traffic on the river and avoiding land-consuming ramps leading to a traditional elevated",
          "Thrill seeker or mouse, well the answer is both. If you want to be a thrill seeker then you can pay 7\u20ac and walk the upper walkways for panoramic veiws however you must have nerves of steel. Many 16-21 year old males doing this when we visited. This is 50 metres high and you do",
          "This bridge was recommended by a member of staff at a metro station and was well worth the visit. From Portugalete station there are escalators on the hill down to the bridge, so getting back up is no problem if you decide not to take the bridge. Near the bridge there are plenty",
          "First of this type of bridge built in the world. Impressive construction. Disappointed we couldn't walk across the top of the structure (we got there too early in the day) - was open at 3pm. Come and see the one in Middlesbrough/Stockton England!",

          "I would take the trip up to the bridge just to ride on such an interesting mechanism - the fact that it is an essential mode of transport for the local people makes adds to feeling. As it happens the riverside walks on both banks are very nice, bars and cafes around too. However",
          "We took the Metro from Bilbao out to Portugalete on the recommendation of a friend and were not disappointed. We had no map and the sign posting is not great but we had fun wandering through the pretty streets of Portugalete before we found the Puente Bizkaia. It's an amazing",

          "Well worth a visit if your touring Bilbao . \u20ac7 for the elevator up ,,, to walk across the top of the bridge and back down the other side and back across on the cable car . The view back towards Bilbao city and out to the bay of biscay are worth it , good pictures to be taken . I",
          "The walk across the top of the bridge is not to be missed. It is not scary and the walk way is enclosed. Great views and a fascinating history to the bridge.",
          "We arrived here by metro through Areeta stop , long walks , fresh air and lots of good food around. One of Bilbao hidden gem to explore for family fun day. I enjoyed the panoramic view for photography. Good value for passing your time and admiring the marina.",
          "I look back and begrudge the time I wasted going to see this bridge 20 minutes each way on a smelly train to go see a bridge that is neither beautiful nor a engineering miracle I would not recommend and I would not do it again",
          "We stopped off at this port whilst on a cruise on a Sunday morning . We walked into town from the cruise terminal about 20 mins and came across this magnificent bridge .Firstly we went across on the traffic gondola to the other side and had a snack and drink and on the way back",
          "Good to walk across - can get blue line Metro to San Turtzi and then after walking over, back to Bilbao from station Areeta, red line. Go to the little bar/cafe by the bridge on Getxo side, really nice, busy.busy and clean toilets.",
          "Reminded me of Middlesborough! I though the bridge was a nice bonus, the walk and views along the waterfront are well worth the trip. Either metro line will get you there about 20 minutes from Bilbao centre. Not that your Barik card is valid to cross the bridge.",
          "The \"bridge\" is a good excuse to make some twenty-minute metro trip outside the central Bilbao. After checking out the weird design and mechanics of this UNESCO heritage thingy, the northern strand towards the bay of Biscaya offers a really nice walk by the marine full of yachts",
          "I was not sure about the visit when the Informaction tourist officer give me this piece of advice. I thank her! This red metallic Bridge it's a masterpiece. Declared UNESCO Heritage Site.Built in 1893 by the Architect Alberto de Palacio, it is the oldest river crossing bridge.",
          "The charge for walking across the top level is a bit steep at 7 euros, but, wow, it is just incredible up there. We spent ages walking back and forth, snapping photos. Really fantastic views. And it is so cool when the car is moving, you can feel it, hear it, see it, thrilling.",
          "A pleasant surprise and a way of getting from one side of a river to the other in a way you won't have seen before. The bridge represents the areas industrial past & heritage. On the east side it is complimented by a small well presented garden area with cafe. There has been a",
          "Easy to get to by metro from Bilboa ~get off at Portugalete and walk down the hill to the bridge. The tourist information office on the quayside was very helpful. You can walk along the gantry above the gondala for 7 Euro which was well worth it. The lift wasn`t working at",
          "This is the first suspension bridge in the world, or pendent ferry, becouse people and vehicles entering in the cabin, which is pendent on the cables transferred to the other side of the river. It is posible to cross the bridge on the walk, using elevator, but cost 7\u20ac. Using",
          "Last week I spent some days in Bilbao and enjoyed very much a trip to Portogelate a small town north of Bilbao. There you find a so called transporter bridge from 1893. You can walk in 50m height above the river level and see the estuar, the port and the towns around.",
          "Great value - cross a world heritage designation bridge for less than a Euro or walk over the high gantry via the lift for seven euro. See the old town at portugalete then stroll over to the beach at Getcho. A day that will be remembered for a long time.",
          "This transporter bridge is of historical interest and well worth a trip across the river. it's only 35cents and if you engage with local people they are very proud to tell you all about it .We weren't sure how to buy the ticket from the machine and about five people offered to",
          "This century old bridge is always fun to watch and travel on (by foot, bicycle or car). You will have to travel far to find one like it.",
          "We visited here previously a few years ago and were here again in September with friends so we visited the bridge again. The view from the top alone is a good reason to go. We hadn't realised on our last visit that your ticket also entitles you to a free return trip in the",
          "This world heritage site comes at the end of the Bilboat cruise but those with an interest in engineering may like to take a better look and even a ride. Said to be only seven such bridges left in the world, this is said to be the first of its kind. Certainly not something that",
          "This bridge was pretty cool. At first I didn't get what the fuss was about, and I think my husband thought I'd gone blind, but then I realized that the reason it is cool, is because it's kind of a hanging car that brings people across instead of the typical bridge that you",
          "We didnt have much time an parking in that area can take edges so we left the car in a parking next to the bridge (not expensive). Elevator!! Take the elevator and go walking over!! It was great, but also very hot. Better to visit when it is not so sunny.",
          "We parked near the bridge (reasonable tariff) and travelled over to getxo just for the trip but found that getxo has a nice prom and small beach so we stopped for a swim and relax before walking back over the top of the bridge, yikes, for a spectacular view. We went up into",
          "If You want to see this bridge in suburb of Bilbao You must take a 45 minutes ride by train or metro. You will pass through old industrial and harbour neighbourhood and come in a beautiful small place Portugalete. The pearl is strange bridge with cabin made for passing old ships",
          "Due to short time, I was not planning to visit this bridge during the couple of days I spent working in Bilbao. However, when coming back from Guggenheim museum, the taxi driver was so proudly talking about it that convinced me to stop to see the Vizcaya Bridge. Actually it",
          "This unique bridge is built 1891. It is 160 metres long, 45 metres high. It is world's oldest transporter bridge and can transport six cars in 1,5 minutes. It connects Portugalete and Las Arenas (Getxo) cross the river. It is quite frightening experience to take a lift and walk",
          "This is one of the most wonderful experiences a traveler can have for very little money. This a unique bridge that is accross the Nervion river. Technically it is not a bridge. There is a gondola which travels back and forth from one bank to the other and its capable of",
          "We stayed in a hotel overlooking the bridge and were so intrigued....what a great day trip to walk over the bridge, be a car passenger or just a passenger. \u20ac0.35 to be a passenger (not sure for cars) and \u20ac7 to walk it. Have information on the history there too if you're",
          "From Bilbao take the Metro to Portugalete to see this late 19th century mechanical wonder. Just 40 cents per pedestrian to make a surprisingly smooth and swift crossing in the suspended gondola. For braver souls it is possible to ascend by lift and walk across the top of the",
          "People visit Bilbao and feel that THE 'must see' attraction is the Guggenheim museum, but this must be a close second. Unfortunately, I believe that a lot of people don't bother to visit as it is about 20 minutes by Metro from the city centre. It is a functioning piece of",
          "Perhaps I am a bit terrified of heights but I was quite happy to let my husband do the walking across on the top of this amazing bridge while I took the gondola. He took some really good photos from the walkway and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. For me the pleasure was the",
          "We visited this bridge on a Sunday afternoon. We were a bit confused at first trying to figure out the ticket machine but you actually get the ticket for walking the top of the bridge from inside the little tourist office below it. I am not the biggest fan of heights and going",
          "Wonderful world heritage, I wasn't expecting such a wonderful transportation bridge 120 years old in such good shape and still working. Lots of people use it nowadays to go from one side of the Ria to the other, from Portugalete to Getxo. It is worth going from one side to the",
          "We can to Bilbao for only reason to visit this world heritage. Its unique and it\u2019s working for everyday life for local people. It\u2019s amazing. Is was not good weather on the day thus we did not get walking the high footpath but we got in the hanging bridge few times to across",
          "I'm fairly comfortable with heights, but I'd certainly feel safer with a steel walkway rather than a wooden bolted effort. Not that I'm judging Spanish engeering. The view on a clear day is awesome especially out towards the sea. As comfortable as I am, I still made sure I stood",
          "This is a world heritage site well worth seeing, especially if you have never seen a \"hanging\" bridge before. You might even see people bungee jumping from the top. Sit at the caf\u00e9 on the corner and enjoy the spectacle or walk around the corner to the marina.",
          "If you like industrial herritage, this is the place to see. Take the Metro from Bilbao. It is a working transporter bridge, cars and pedestrians are ferried accros the river. Buy an ticket for \u20ac7 and take the lift to the top of the bridge, here you can walk to the other side and",
          "I was enchanted by this industrial accomplishment. The bridge has something in common with the Eiffel Tower and besides, it's useful too! People and cars can cross the bay on a \"flying\" ferry that is definitely worth seeing. Also, the view from up on the bridge is wonderful!",
          "I enjoyed visiting this historic bridge, the walk across the top of it is memorable for the great views of Getxo and Bilbao.",
          "The first transport bridge, Puente Colgante / Puente Vizcaya, was built in 1893. It is worth to visit! 45 meters high. You can reach it by metro (about 20 minutes), station Portugalente or the other side of river: station Areeta. Take a lift ride up and walk to the other side.",
          "We were taken to this amazing bridge by locals. The sensation of floating above the river is wonderful, the transporter leaves regularly. In Portugalete we saw a small farmers market and walked around the beautiful old streets.",
          "The walk along the sea wall is beautiful with many different style of houses all with descriptions on a plaque on the sea wall. Then to cap it all you will see Vizcaya Bridge which is the oldest hanging transporter bridge in the world. It was built in 1893 and designed by",
          "My husband went up the lift and along the top for 7 euros and I took gondilier for less than a euro. He got the spectacular view. You could pay for it with the travel card that we got at the train station that you can use for two people. For buses trams, metro, funicular.",
          "It is the world's oldest transporter bridge. You should definitely go up by elevator and enjoy spectacular views of Portugalete on one side, Getxo on the other and the seaside. It can be reached by metro from Bilbao and it's really worth a visit.",
          "We had 1 hour available in Bilbao and we decided to take a 30-minutes trip by subway from the centre of the city to reach this attraction in Portugalete (Areeta subway stop). Just out of the subway you will find the signs to reach the bridge with a short walk, it is a few",
          "Worth the detour! This bridge, the oldest of its kind must be seen, make sure to pass the river with it. Getxo is also nice with many Good restaurangs, if the wether is nice, make this a day trip!",
          "Really worth a visit, world's oldest transporter bridge - takes 6 cars and dozen of passengers. Runs every 8 mins (trip minute & half). It's on the world heritage list and nicknamed 'the Eiffel tower of Vizcaya'. A truly wonderful sight! And you can go up the towers by lift.",
          "for an architect (me) and a photographer (my husband) this was the perfect place: stunning views (with a bit scary walkway) of town and seaside, and hands-on engineering of the last century, very impressive!",
          ".35 euro one way. even was a long walk in a warm day, worth it. was told only take 20 minutes to walk to, actually took us 1 hour to walk. best maybe is taking the taxi from port for 9 euro one way. we walked there and walked back. nices views and luxury houses along the shore.",
          "For 5 Euro you can walk across the top of this bridge, and if you want amazing views of the surrounding area, it is worth it. It is only 35 cents to be carried across though, which is MUCH more affordable.",
          "I've never seen anything like this, and even as someone who is not generally interested in engineering, it was worth a visit. For those wanting to \"drive\" across it, be aware that there is a queuing system in operation and you will make lots of locals very angry if you turn",
          "Very unusual site . .Unesco World Heritage Site. Built in 1893. We went in March 2011.",
          "An easy metro ride on line 1 from central Bilbao to Areeta and a very short walk gets you to this amazing transporter bridge which is more correctly called the Puente Vizkaya. It was built at the same time as the Eiffel Tower to which it bears more than a passing resemblance,",
          "I was very happy to see this bridge - such a unique engineering feat for its time. It is so graceful and so quiet in operation. If you are interested in history or engineering, this is a must see attraction. To get there from Bilbao, we took the Metro and got off at the",
          "Biscay bridge or ferry flying. The oldest bridge of this type was built in 1893 by the project of Basque architect Alberto de Palacio, one of the pupils of Gustave Eiffel. Gondola carries six cars and several tens passengers from one bank to another 3 minutes. The gondola runs",
          "We visited Getxo due to its proximity to Bilbao and stayed just 200 metres from its hanging bridge - a UNESCO world heritage sight. Though I'd seen photos, I never imagined a massive piece of steelwork could actually be beautiful - but it is. And it is in constant use: carrying",
          "It is like a time travel! The bridge is app. 100 years old and this type of bridge is becoming very rare. The towers are rigged to the rocks as the masts of a ship. We drove our car on the ferry and were hoisted to the other side. Unfortunately the towers are in scaffolding for",
          "on our way out of Bilbao, we decided to check this out. Really glad we did, as I've not seen anything like it. The structure itself is beautiful, but when you get up close, you really understand the mechanism, and the genius behind it.",
          "This bridge is unique, as there are only a few left in the world. The bridge in England is not in use anymore. This one you can walk on top by using an elevator and return biy the ferry hanging on the cables. And if this is not enough, you vcan even buy a souvenir like a pop-up"

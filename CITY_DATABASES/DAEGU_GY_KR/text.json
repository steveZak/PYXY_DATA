        "wiki": "The COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). On 20 January 2020, the first case in South Korea was announced. The number of confirmed cases increased on 19 February by 20, and on 20 February by 58 or 70, giving a total of 346 confirmed cases on 21 February 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Korea (KCDC), with the sudden jump mostly attributed to \"Patient 31\" who participated in a gathering at a Shincheonji Church of Jesus the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony church in Daegu.Amidst the fears of further contamination, mass gatherings in the affected cities were cancelled and a few hundred soldiers in Daegu were placed in isolation. On 4 February 2020, in order to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, South Korea began denying entry to foreigners traveling from Hubei Province.By 9 April 2020, South Korea had about 10,423 cases and 204 deaths, with over 494,711 people having been tested, a case fatality rate of 1.95%, which is lower than the WHO's global case fatality rate of 4.34%.South Korea introduced what was considered one of the largest and best-organised epidemic control programs in the world, along with Taiwan, Vietnam, and Singapore. Different measures have been taken to screen the mass population for the virus, and isolate any infected people as well as trace and quarantine those who contacted them, without further lockdown. The rapid and extensive tests taken by South Korea have been judged successful in limiting the spread of the outbreak, without using the drastic measure of quarantining entire cities.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\n\nDuring the first four weeks, South Korea controlled the potential spread of COVID-19 by using high-tech resources like tracking the use of credit cards and checking CCTV footage of confirmed patients. However, since 18 February, the number of cases increased to more than 1,700 after discovery of the fact that patient No. 31 was a member of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus. Some media reported that was difficult for KCDC to screen the patient because Shincheonji teaches that illness is sin. Many members were uncooperative with KCDC and could not be contacted. Shincheonji denied this, and other sources report that the sect did cooperate with the authorities. About half of confirmed cases were linked to the Shincheonji Church as of 27 February; this was verified by health officials. As of 10 March, the KCDC was able to contact and test most of the Shincheonji Church members, with the total number of tests nationally standing at around 200,000.\n\n\n=== 20 January \u2013 17 February ===\n\nOn 20 January, the first confirmed case was identified as a 35-year-old Chinese woman. The first South Korean national to be infected occurred three days later was a 55-year-old man who worked in Wuhan and returned for a checkup with flu symptoms. The two infection reports were publicly released on 24 January.On 26 January, a third case as a 54-year-old South Korean man. He had used a rental car and visited three restaurants, a hotel, a convenience store and met his family before admitting himself to hospital. All these places were disinfected.On 27 January, a fourth case was reported as a 55-year-old South Korean man who returned from Wuhan on 20 January. He first experienced flu symptoms on 21 January and suffered further complications four days later, eventually turning himself in. Both cases were tallied into formal records on 27 January.On 1 February, an update on the first four patients indicated that the first three patients were showing weaker symptoms and recovering well while the fourth patient was getting treatment from pneumonia. Rumours circulated that the fourth patient had died which health authorities denied.Two more confirmed cases were reported on 30 January. The fifth patient was a 32-year-old South Korean man who returned from his work at Wuhan on 24 January. The sixth patient was the first case in South Korea who had never visited Wuhan. The 56-year-old man caught the virus when visiting a restaurant with the third patient.On 31 January, a seventh patient was reported as a 28-year-old South Korean man returning from Wuhan on 23 January. He developed symptoms on 26 January, and was admitted to the hospital on 28 January. On the same day, four more patients were admitted into the record as the eighth patient, 62-year-old South Korean woman, returned from Wuhan. The ninth patient caught the virus from the fifth patient through direct contact while the tenth and the eleventh patient were the wife and child who were infected while visiting the sixth patient.On 1 February, a 49-year-old Chinese national working in Japan as a tour guide was confirmed as the twelfth patient. He caught the virus while visiting a Japanese patient in Japan and entered South Korea through Gimpo International Airport on 19 January. The KCDC confirmed an additional three cases on 2 February, bringing the total to fifteen.A woman, who had returned from Thailand after a five-day vacation, was tested positive and confirmed as the sixteenth case on 4 February. Three more cases were confirmed on 5 February, bringing the total case count to 19. The seventeenth and nineteenth patients had attended a conference in Singapore and been in contact with an infected individual there. The very same day the KCDC announced that the second patient had been released from hospital after being tested negative in consecutive tests, becoming the country's first coronavirus patient to fully recover.\n\n\n=== 18 February \u2013 29 February ===\n\nOn 18 February, South Korea confirmed its 31st case in Daegu, a member of the Shincheonji religious organisation. The patient continued to go to gatherings of Shincheonji days after showing symptoms, which are typically held with people in very close proximity and include physical contact of the members. Many of the patient's close contacts would turn out to be infected, triggering a drastic escalation of the South Korean spread of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.On 19 February, the number of confirmed cases increased by 20. On 20 February 70 new cases were confirmed, giving a total of 104 confirmed cases, according to the KCDC. According to Reuters, KCDC attributed the sudden jump of 70 cases linked to \"Patient No. 31\", who had participated in a gathering in Daegu at the Shincheonji Church of Jesus the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony.On 20 February, the streets of Daegu were empty in reaction to the Shincheonji outbreak. A resident described the reaction, stating \"It's like someone dropped a bomb in the middle of the city. It looks like a zombie apocalypse.\" The first death was reported in a mental ward of Cheongdo Daenam Hospital in Cheongdo County. According to the mayor of Daegu, the number of suspected cases as of 21 February was 544 among 4,400 examined followers of the church. The hospital was suspected as the source of the present outbreak after it was visited by a woman who became the second fatal case of South Korea on that day. Upon investigation, it was determined that the infection had spread to that hospital through a funeral ceremony attended by members of the church.All South Korean military bases were on lockdown after tests confirmed three soldiers to be positive for the virus. Airlines cut connections and cultural schedules were being canceled due to fears of further spread. United States Forces Korea raised the alert level from low to moderate and cut off non-essential travel to and from USFK Daegu. USFK Daegu's school facilities were closed and non-essential personnel were ordered to stay at home while any visitors going there were not allowed to enter. USFK announced that the widow of a retired soldier who was in Daegu was diagnosed to be positive for the virus on 24 February. Camp Humphreys enacted virus detection protocols, including temperature checks and raised the alert level to high. On 26 February, an American soldier based at Camp Carroll was diagnosed to be positive and was quarantined away from bases via off-base housing unit with contact tracing done that showed his movements to Camp Walker.As of 22 February, among 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261 reported symptoms. At the time, 169 confirmed cases involved the same church and another 111 came from the Cheongdo Daenam Hospital. 23 February saw another 123 cases with 75 being from Shincheonji and 24 February saw 161 additional cases with 129 being from the same religious group. Over 27,000 people have been tested for the virus with 19,127 negative results.On 24 February, 15 countries imposed travel restrictions to and from South Korea. It was also reported that a senior health official overseeing the COVID-19 efforts in Daegu tested positive and was also a member of Shincheonji. Within a few days, a petition to the nation's president urging for the disbandment of the church had over 750,000 signatures. Their headquarters in Gwacheon was raided by law enforcement and government officials said all 245,000 members of the religious group would be found and tested.On 28 February, over 2,000 confirmed cases were reported.\n\n\n=== March ===\nOn 2 March, there were over 4,200 confirmed cases. With an additional 4,000 cases of COVID-19 within two weeks, and roughly 60% of the total infections nationwide having stemmed from the church, the Seoul city government asked prosecutors to press charges against the religious group's founder and senior members for murder, causing harm, and for violating the Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act. Interviews have occurred with all 230,000 members of the religious group and nearly 9,000 were said to be showing symptoms of the virus. Due to the number of infections in the country, ninety-five countries have banned or limited entry for South Korean passport holders. Testing is also conducted at drive-through testing sites where patients do not leave their vehicles, but are met by medical personnel in hazmat suits over several stations. The process is completed in a few minutes and results come in several days.On 8 March, KCDC in South Korea announced that 79.4% of confirmed COVID-19 cases were related to group infection. KCDC also announced that outbreak associated with Shincheonji Church totaled 4,482 infections, accounting for 62.8% of the total confirmed cases.13 March was the first time since the outbreak on 20 January in which the number of recoveries, 177, was larger than the number of those who newly tested positive, 110.  However, with the recent cluster of cases in the Seoul Capital Area, there are new fears that infections may rise sharply.The controversy about Shincheonji also continued, and generated international interest. After the lawsuit started by the Mayor of Seoul, the police raided the church premises to check whether the list of members supplied by Shincheonji pursuant to a request by the authorities was, as the Mayor argued, not complete. The authorities checked the list seized during the raid with the one Shincheonji had supplied, and concluded that discrepancies were minor.The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) expressed concern that religious freedom rights of Shincheonji members may be violated in South Korea by \"exaggerating the church's role in the outbreak,\" and stated that, \"USCIRF has received reports of individuals encountering discrimination at work and spousal abuse because of their affiliation with the church.\" USCIRF reported that South Korean \"Vice Minister of Health Kim Kang-lip has publicly stated that the Shincheonji church has cooperated with authorities.\" The Belgian NGO Human Rights Without Frontiers and CESNUR released a \"White Paper\" claiming that, although it did make \"mistakes\" in its management of the crisis, Shincheonji had also been discriminated because of its status as an unpopular group in South Korea.On 17 March, around 79 church devotees were infected with the virus after attending the River of Grace Community Church. The infections were claimed to have been caused by spraying salt-water into followers' mouths, under the belief that this would protect them from the virus. Nearly 140 churches in Gyeonggi Province, which surrounds Seoul and is part of the Greater Seoul Area, will be closed if they do not implement preventative measures, including temperature checks, two-meter separation, and the wearing of masks. As more churches are holding services despite a government order for social distancing, on 30 March, the controversial Manmin Central Church in Guro, Seoul became a cluster with 22 infections linked to a gathering in early March in which the group was preparing stock footage to use for online worship services. Other church clusters have appears in the cities of Suwon, Busan, Geochang, and Bucheon.\n\n\n=== April ===\nAs infection rates have risen outside Korea leading to increases of sick arriving in the country (476 of 9,661 cases were imported as of 30 March), the KCDC will be implementing stronger infectious disease control measures for travelers coming from overseas as of 1 April. Additionally, new self-quarantine measures for travelers coming from Europe or the United States will be in effect from the same day. For example, those showing symptoms but test negative, and those who are without symptoms and are staying short-term in Korea, need to quarantine for two weeks in a government provided facility. Costs for the stay at the facility are the responsibility of the individual and total 100,000 won (US$81) per day. A few days later, a Taiwanese woman was deported on 5 April for refusing to stay in a quarantine facility as she initially agreed and then later disagreed with paying for the cost of staying at the government designated facility, reportedly costing around 100,000 won per day.A total of 45 people are being investigated by the police for allegedly violating COVID-19 self-isolation. Under the revised anti-infectious disease law, violators can face up to a year in prison, a 10 million won fine, or in the case of foreign passport holders\u2014deportation.Seeing the infodemic on COVID-19 information starting in China and spreading to Korea and the US, fake news researcher Cha Meeyoung of KAIST and the Institute for Basic Science, along with researchers from Ewha Womans University, started the multilingual Facts Before Rumors campaign to separate common claims seen online.A Canadian cast member with the touring The Phantom of the Opera stage play entered Korea on March 12, participated for roughly two weeks, and tested positive 2 April. An American colleague tested positive on 4 April, which shut down production of the musical until 14 April while the venue could be disinfected and contacts of the staff, those staying in the same hotel, and over 8,000 people who recently attended were contacted by health authorities who told them to stay indoors and contact a testing center if they develop symptoms.On 13 April, it was reported that at least 116 individuals who were infected and later cleared of the virus had again tested positive. The cause for this is under investigation but early speculation considered faulty tests, reactivation of the virus instead of re-infection, or remnants of the virus might remain yet not be harmful to the host or other individuals. The nation also stated their plans to send 600,000 testing kits to the United States and asked people to continue social distancing while hinting that a loosening of these regulations might come in the near future. By 17 April, the KCDC stated that it knew of 163 patients who were said to have recovered, but again tested positive. The exact cause was not known but they stated several possibilities.Patient #31 continuously stayed in the hospital 58 days, as of 14 April. The single occupancy room she is in costs 400,000 KRW per day (roughly US$360) with a total hospital bill thus far north of 40 million won (roughly US$36,000). While she is the longest hospitalized COVID-19 patient in Korea, 4.9% of those infected have stayed in a hospital more than 50 days. Additionally, another one thousand people have been quarantined for four weeks or more.After several days with new infections numbering in the single digits (April 18, 20, 22), the government announced it was going to start lifting restrictions starting with stores, restaurants, gyms, cram schools, bars, and religious services; which is notable as most of the nation's infections came from places of worship. In coming weeks, arboretums, forests and national parks will begin to open with social distancing still in place until at least early May. After seeing Korea successfully lower cases of infection, President Moon Jae-in has engaged in \"coronavirus diplomacy\" with leaders of other nations, part of which involved exporting test kits to more than 20 countries. On April 26, confirmed patient number 31 in Daegu  was discharged after 67 days.\n\n\n=== May ===\nAfter a sustained period of reported cases in the country being below 20, a new cluster emerged in central Seoul. A 29-year-old patient from Yongin was found to have visited at least five nightclubs in Itaewon during the late night hours of May 1 and the subsequent early morning hours of May 2. After having gone to other places in Seoul and neighboring Gyeonggi and Gangwon provinces, he tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to a hospital in Suwon. His more than 1,300 contacts, several among them being difficult to identify and trace, were urged to self-isolate and have themselves tested for the virus. Because of this incident, the Seoul city government has ordered all clubs, bars, room salons, and other nightlife establishments in the city to close indefinitely. As of May 10, the number of cases that was linked to this cluster has since increased to 54, and is still expected to rise because of the large number of potentially exposed individuals. On 11 May, there were 79 cases linked with the clubs in Itaewon. As multiple media outlets clearly identified at least one of the bars as being a gay bar, the LGBT community in Seoul fears an anti gay backlash; social media users have threatened to track and stop the \"immoral acts\" in some of the nightclubs.\n\n\n== Statistics ==\n\n\n=== By region ===\n\n\n=== By gender and age ===\n\n\n=== By imported ===\n\n\n== Containment ==\nIn its efforts to fight and contain the virus, South Korea has combined testing with contact tracing.Infected South Koreans are required to go into isolation in government shelters. Their phones and credit card data are used to trace their prior movements and find their contacts. Those who are determined to have been near the infected individual receive phone alerts with information about their prior movements.According to Chun Byung-Chul, an epidemiologist at Korea University, high-risk patients who have underlying illnesses are prioritized for hospitalization. Patients with moderate symptoms are sent to \"repurposed corporate training facilities and spaces provided by public institutions,\" where they receive observation and medical support. Patients who recover and test negative twice are released. Close contacts and infected individuals with minimal symptoms who can measure their own temperatures and whose family members are free of any chronic disease are required to self-quarantine for two weeks. Local monitoring teams calls the quarantined twice a day to make sure that they stay where they are and to ask about symptoms.\n\n\n== Preventive measures ==\nThose ordered to self-quarantine are required to download an app that alerts officials if the patient moves outside of the quarantine. Violators are fined up to $2,500.\n\n\n== Impacts and reactions ==\n\nBy 18 March, South Korea's KOSPI stock index had dropped nearly 30% compared to a month earlier. The drop began on 23 February, when the country raised the coronavirus alert to 'highest level'. On 15 March, the KOSPI closed at 1,771.44 and the Kosdaq finished at 524 points, down 7%, prompting the Financial Supervisory Commission to impose a six-month ban on short-selling, the first such action in nearly nine years. This was despite a markedly lower daily increase in cases. Automaker Hyundai Motor Company, having shut down its factories as the outbreak intensified, saw exports drop 21.4% in February from the same month last year.\n\n\n=== Social impact ===\n\nAs of 25 February, Daegu officials were aggressively warning residents to take precautions, while allowing private businesses such as restaurants to stay open. As a precautionary measure, many restaurants check the temperatures of their customers before accepting them. It is common for \"offices, hotels, and other large buildings\" to use thermal image cameras in order to identify people with fevers. All Daegu's public libraries, museums, churches, day-care centers and courts had been closed.Apart from the city of Daegu and the church community involved, most of South Korea is operating close to normality, although nine planned festivals have been closed and tax-free retailers are closing. The South Korean military manpower agency made an announcement that conscription from Daegu will temporarily be suspended. The Daegu Office of Education decided to postpone the start of every school in the region by one week.Numerous educational institutes have temporarily shut down, including dozens of kindergartens in Daegu and several elementary schools in Seoul. As of 18 February, most universities in South Korea had announced plans to postpone the start of the spring semester. This included 155 universities planning to delay the semester start by two weeks to 16 March, and 22 universities planning to delay the semester start by one week to 9 March. Also, on 23 February 2020, all kindergartens, elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools were announced to delay the semester start from 2 to 9 March.The economy of South Korea is forecast to grow 1.9%, which is down from 2.1%. The government has provided 136.7 billion won for local governments as support. The government has also organized the procurement of masks and other hygiene equipment.Entertainment agency SM Entertainment reportedly donated five hundred million won in efforts to fight the disease.In the K-POP industry, the rapid spread of the coronavirus within South Korea has led to the cancellations or postponing of concerts and other events for K-POP acts within and outside of South Korea, with example situations including the cancellation of the remaining Asia dates and the Europe leg for Seventeen\u2019s Ode To You Tour on 9 February 2020 and the cancellation of all Seoul dates for BTS' Map of the Soul Tour.\n\n\n=== Travel restrictions ===\n\nAs of 20 March, a total of 171 countries and territories had issued entry bans or suspended visas for travelers from South Korea. On 16 March, USFK announced that travel restrictions for Cheonan city had been removed due to a decline in COVID-19 cases. Troops and Defense Department personnel residing in Cheonan were told to \"contact their command prior to returning to work.\"\n\n\n=== Government reactions ===\n\n\n=== Number of inspections ===\nThe Blue House announced on 28 February the current status of coronavirus tests in Korea, comparing the testing situation in the United States and Japan. The number of inspections was 26 and 120 times higher than in those countries respectively as of 28 Feb. The cumulative number of inspections was about 53,000 by South Korea, while Japan was about 2,000, and in US about 440 cases were examined.\n\n\n=== Reactions from KMA ===\nOn 26 January, the Korean Medical Association (KMA) asked the government to temporarily bar entry to all travelers arriving from mainland China, but this recommendation was not followed. On 27 January, KMA President Choi Dae-zip said: \"The third confirmed case indicates that we have reached the point where we have to get rid of passive stance and actively prepare for the worsening of the situation, (and) the government should thoroughly monitor the trend of China's national outbreak of the virus and prepare administrative measures such as complete entry ban from China in case of the worst situation.\" On 3 February, The KMA recommended halting all travel from China, rather than only from Hubei province. After all, The KMA called for stronger government response in a total of six statements between 20 January, when the nation's first confirmed case occurred, and 18 February. A short time after that, cases spiked in Daegu and throughout the country.\n\n\n=== Public reactions ===\n\n\n==== Presidential approval rating ====\nAlthough there are many confirmed cases of COVID-19, President Moon Jae-in's approval rating rose by two percentage points to 44%. During the MERS crisis, the previous President Park Geun-hye's approval rating had fallen sharply to 29% due to inadequate management the MERS infection.In opinion poll conducted by Gallup Korea in the second week of March 2020, president Moon's approval rating has risen by 5% to 49%.\n\n\n==== Anti-foreigner sentiment ====\nIn February 2020, an entrance to a South Korean restaurant in downtown Seoul reportedly had a sign in red Chinese characters stating: \"No Chinese Allowed.\" \"No Chinese\" signs have been cropping up, and some businesses are simply banning all foreigners. Some foreign residents have been excluded from the government mask distribution program as it is currently only allowed to 1.25 million foreigners who were subscribed to the public health insurance. Concerning COVID-19, more than 760,000 South Korean citizens have signed a petition lobbying the government to ban Chinese tourists from entering the country. The Daegu Lantern Festival mistakenly posted a notice in English that no foreigners are allowed to visit. However, the wrong sentence was removed and it was revealed a translation error by the PR agency regarding statement from a Daegu government official. The official in the Daegu city stated that the original message was the notification to foreign tourists about the delayed schedule of festival over COVID-19 concerns. At least one Jamaican reported widespread discrimination, and foreigners were excluded from citywide stimulus funds, with the exception of Ansan city. Despite making up only 7% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases related to the Itaewon cluster, on May 10th foreigners were urged to get tested.\n\n\n==== Homophobia ====\nOn May 1, a 29 year old patient from Yongin visited several night clubs in Itaewon, a district in Seoul with multiple LGBTQ friendly nightclubs. When the infection spread, homophobic comments were left on CCTV videos of the club in question. The mayor of Seoul has threatened to send police to the homes of people who may have been infected, raising concerns over anti-LGBTQ harassment. Jeong Gol Lee, general director of a LGTBQ rights group in South Korea, said there have been many malicious reports about gay men since the Itaewon cluster emerged.\n\n\n=== International response ===\nOn 24 February, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) upgraded the status of South Korea to level 3 (avoid non-essential travels due to widespread community transmission).On 28 February, Charles Schwab Corporation advised employees who had travelled to China and South Korea to self-quarantine for 14 days. Multiple companies such as Amazon, Google, TD Bank Group, Bank of Nova Scotia, London Stock Exchange Group, and Cargill, Inc. deferred all non-essential travels to areas affected by the outbreak.As of 8 March, US military has suspended all travels to and from South Korea for all military personnel and their family over the concern of the virus.As of 10 March, 109 countries or regions restrict entry of visitors from South Korea.\n\n\n=== View of foreign media on COVID-19 in South Korea ===\nThe Washington Post has praised the South Korean government's handling of coronavirus outbreak and stated that South Korea is a model for the U.S. response instead of Iran. The Washington Post also appreciated South Korea's response as a successful model for democratic countries.Agence France-Presse has compared South Korea's handling of coronavirus outbreak with China. The newspaper stated that \"While China locked down cities, Seoul embraced widespread testing and public notice of movements of those infected, raising some privacy concerns\". Also, AFP analyzed that the South Korean government handled the crisis using a model of open information, public participation, and widespread testing. Additionally, according to the paper, Masahiro Kami, a chairperson of the Tokyo-based Medical Governance Research Institute stated that South Korea is a good model for every country for handling the coronavirus outbreak.WSJ analyzed the aggressive Coronavirus Test Program in South Korea. The government contacted the citizens proactively to test the coronavirus in various ways including a home visit, a quick 10 minutes drop off drive-through COVID-19 testing center free of charge. Although South Korea has not yet defeated the outbreak, experts credit the emphasis on energetic COVID-19 test program with reducing case numbers and fatalities.UPI has analyzed that South Korea's model has worked on handling coronavirus outbreak without any further harder restrictions on foreigners. The paper also observed that Health authorities have aggressively promoted hygiene and social distancing. Additionally, according to the paper Kim Jong-hwan, an administrator at Seoul Metropolitan Eunpyeong Hospital positively evaluated the government's deal with coronavirus outbreak by stating that \"The government's response has been so well-organized. I'm proud of it.\"Time magazine and BBC News concluded that the reason for the high number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in South Korea is thanks to the relative \"openness\" and \"transparency\" of South Korean society. The rapid spread of the virus was linked with the Shincheonji Church, with a significant proportion of the early cases linked to religious services held by the group in Daegu. The Blue House announced on 28 February the current status of coronavirus tests in three countries: Korea, the United States, and Japan, and analyzed statistically the reasons why there were so many confirmed cases in South Korea: the number of inspections was 26 or 120 times higher than other countries. The cumulative number of inspections was about 53,000 in South Korea, with only 2,000 in Japan and 440 cases examined in the United States. After the tests, the rate of confirmed cases was highest in Japan (9.04%), followed by Korea (3.3%) and the United States (3.15%).Bloomberg L.P. analyzed the reason for the low death rate in South Korea. South Korea experienced serious difficulties during the outbreak of MERS in 2015 due to a lack of test kits. Afterwards, the country approved rapid deployment of COVID-19 test kits, and now they are able to test more than 10,000 people a day. In neighboring Japan, only about 2,700 people in total have been tested for COVID-19 as of 3 March. Officials in Seoul operate \"drive-through\" testing stations for quick testing. Diagnostics company Seegene Inc. is also exporting its test kits to other countries including China, Europe and the US.AFP attributed the factors behind the low death rate of South Korea to the rigorous testing and the infected population profile. South Korea's widespread testing leads mild or asymptomatic cases to be identified so the proportion of dying goes down. Moreover, the infected population in the South Korea has a unique profile. Most of the country's infections are linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus and most of its members are young women. Statistics show that the virus is most deadly among older generations and men. So the death rate in South Korea is lower than other countries.CNN reported the innovative drive-through testing for COVID-19 in the northern city of Goyang, which was inspired by the drive-through counters at Starbucks. Reuters detailed the new testing facilities in South Korea. Several drive-through coronavirus screening centres were built, including roadside testing facilities. Their purpose is to diagnose patients quickly, while preventing the infection of others in, e.g., a hospital waiting room or a community health center. The entire testing procedure takes several minutes.\nWilliam Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, stressed the importance of the broad testing efforts in South Korea. It would provide us with an unclouded picture of the COVID-19 illness. Victoria\u2019s Chief Health Officer, Brett Sutton has recommended the drive-through coronavirus testing in Australia. On 10 March, Australia opened the first drive-through testing station in Adelaide.Business Insider analyzed the difference of coverage of patient testing patients for COVID-19, comparing the USA to South Korea. Per million citizens, South Korea tested 700 times more than the USA. Fortune explained South Korea's efforts of setting up several \"drive-through\" coronavirus screening facilities as contributing to testing thousands of samples a day.By 10 March, CNN had an interview with South Korea health minister Park Neung-hoo. Park expressed cautiously his desire that the coronavirus outbreak had 'passed the peak' as the number of new daily infections had declined in recent days. The South Korean government had the ability to operate about 15,000 diagnostic tests per day and has conducted over 190,000 tests by 10 March nationwide. Park also answered the inquiry from CNN about practicable tips for controlling COVID-19. Park expressed his view that dealing with outbreaks by focusing efforts on early testing and global cooperation would be crucial instead of the lockdown option, as the virus could still spread quickly without testing. S. Korean authorities have arranged the two types of facilities, one for about 10% of coronavirus patients who required hospitalization and another for the patients who were only suffering from mild symptoms.\n\n\n== Gradual lifting of restrictions ==\nAs of April 18, South Korea only detected single-digit numbers of new cases.  Pre-season baseball is scheduled to start April 20, without fans in the stands, with the regular season to start in early May. They will be the second country in the world, after Taiwan, to hold baseball games this year.  Each player's temperature will be taken twice before a game.  Players will be highly encouraged to wear masks in the clubhouse and in other places, except for in the dugout and on the field.  Barehand high fives and handshakes will be prohibited.  Umpires will wear masks.If a player tests positive, that ballpark will not be used for two days, in order to make way for cleaning and allot time for the virus to die.

          "So there's foreigners discount, go into the building to the right of the lines to claim. Really great park, spent 5 hours there and it went by in a flash. Definitely recommend going at dusk.",
          "There is a lot of things to do in E-world for all ages. The price is worth it for what you can do. The queue length is not too bad compared to other parks. Plenty of places to get pictures. I suggest going in the early evening as the lights are a nice thing to see during sunset.",
          "Having some good memories alone and making use of the leisure time here you wont get it wrong. Scenic view",
          "Queue was long! On a sat evening so expected. The after 5pm tickets were cheaper but not by much. Alot of family friendly rides, not really for thrill seekers. Only Boomerang was mad, the other coaster were so-so. The food variety here is crazy. The fireworks happened right in",
          "I think if you have kids they would like this, but fot 2 adults the rides were just ok. Mostly carnival type rides. The boomerang coaster was fun, the others the lines were too long because it was some sort of holiday. We got kind of bored after a couple hours so left. If",
          "eWorld is a great night out for all ages. Go after 5pm for a discounted ticket - you\u2019ll have more than enough time to do everything. It closes at 9pm in Summer. It was very quiet and we got on every ride without queuing. Only problem is if you are tall like me. I\u2019m 6\u2019 3\u201d tall",
          "Biggest amusement park in Daegu. I guess it is bigger than any other in Busan. 39000 for adult. It is very expensive to me. But I guess it is better than Lotte World or Everland in terms of waiting line. If you choose a good day, you may enjoy any attraction without waiting",
          "I and my boyfriend went to this place for our dating. It was wonderful and fun. Even it was crowded but I love it. I went to the theme park in Seoul before but didn\u2019t feel local because lot of visitor are foreigners but I can feel local here ! I\u2019ve tried roller coster and giant",
          "Honestly, we wouldn\u2019t even have visited here if we knew the conditions of the theme park. First of all, there weren\u2019t many visitors to begin with. I have never been to a theme park that looked so quiet and dead. Most of the rides and games were not operating. The weather was",
          "We made multiple visits to E-World. Its a great place to spend time with family or a date night. Its better when the weather is warm because the wind blows cold in the winter.",
          "I went here with my students and had a great time with them even though it rained part of the day. Many rides and snack/food places. Personally I don't feel like there is much to do around Daegu so if you are here for a visit, it may be worth going. The price might be a little",
          "E-world has a number of rides aimed at both kids and adults. Some are more thrilling than others, as is the case at most Amusement Parks. What sets E-world apart is that it surrounds the 83 Tower and that it can be enjoyed in seasons. When you eventually tire of the rides or",
          "We came to e world on the last day of our 2 week holiday. After 2 weeks of exploring temples and other historical places it was a much need day of fun for my son. It is expensive to get in but we did get a whole day of entertainment, the rides were fun. The little petting zoo",
          "This is a small amusement park but just enough for young children to have a great time. The entrance fee is kind of high but everything inside the park is very affordable. If you plan on going more than 3x a year they offer an annual pass. If you decide after your first visit",
          "I had an amazing time with my niece at the park. We went at about 7pm on a week day there was no waiting in long lines we were able to maneuver through the park and enjoys sights, sounds and food :) I have been a few times I remember when it was called WOO BANG LAND",
          "Great food in the revolving restaurant it is very high end. The urinals face out and are glass so it feels like taking a leak 200 meters up. is the highest tower in Asia (202 meters high, 312 meters in altitude). It has a sky lounge cocktail bar and a restaurant that revolves",
          "This is not a big amusement park but it's OK to visit when You travel to Daegu, South Korea. many rides You can ride, and there are 3 roller-coasters. Try Boomerang rides, I recommend it.",
          "Right next to the tower. Is pretty and has some rides. sometimes the wait times were super long but during the week is less. nice little zoo towards the end of the park with nice plants and such. during the winter you could slide down a snow hill, during the summer they wet the",
          "It's not going to replace Disneyworld in my books but it's good enough for Daegu. A fun distraction for kids or kidults. The cable car ride alone is fun enough.",

          "Very tiring but in a good way. Many different rides for different ages and sizes. The cable car up to the tower was included in our day pass. The view was absolutely gorgeous. Definitely a family day out type of place. Not much variety of food and restaurants on the grounds but",
          "If you're from the states, or a country blessed with amazing amusement parks, then this may not be for you. But, it is a nice little amusement park, with things to suit almost everyone. A good tip is to go on an evening, the tickets are much cheaper and the park is lit up in",
          "Well if you want to pop in and out to get a thrill on the roller coasters then go for it. The frontage looks great but inside and the colours have faded on this resort. Bringing young kids in! they won't know so I'm sure they will have a great time here.",
          "While E-World isn't as big as Everland in Seoul it is still a fun place to visit for kids and adults. It is also near Daegu 83 Tower. If possible, visit at night - the lights around the park make it so much better!",
          "Try here in evening or night. On high season it opens until 10pm and sells all ride free ticket 10000KRW, around 8~9USD entering after 4pm.(on the internet) Flowers are well decorated and several rides are nice. There are tower but you need to pay extra to get to the top deck.",
          "We live in Daegu. We bought a membership. It is nice to go for different things to see for each season. We went for a cherry blossom festival. They have nice big cherry blossom trees! It was beautiful! When you get a membership you also get discounts from 83 tower as well. Ice",
          "The rides were mainly aimed at kids so this part of the day really didn't hit my standards for theme parks. I was really excited to get to the top of the tower and do the Sky Jump. We payed to get to the top but all of the restaurants and bars were shut and there were no refunds",
          "A small amusement park with not much people. It can be said no need to queue for playing attractions. But not much worth to see. Also can visit 83 tower with good view.",
          "I paid the full price admission (33000 won) for a day pass, but it felt like money wasted. Most of the rides weren't open, though looking at the amount of rust on rides like the Hurricane, that seemed like it was probably a good idea. The rides that were open were fun, though,",
          "If you are in Daegu, South Korea, and looking for some excitement, then this is a must visit place for you. The admission fee is expensive, but after 5pm its very cheap. The main attraction is the woobang tower. Ride on the cable car and go the basement of woobang tower. Go to",
          "The park itself feels a little bit like a haunted theme park. There was hardly anybody there and most of the rides weren't in use. The only good thing to see is the Daegu tower which offers some impressive views of all of Daegu. My recommendations - better to save your money",
          "If you go after 5pm it's only 16,000 won ($14). The views from the top of the tower are impressive and when we went they were doing a special light show for Christmas. It's expensive but if you're young at heart you'll enjoy it. There's a couple great roller coasters, bumper",
          "I and my wife went here just after children's day....a beautiful sunny day....we paid almost sixty dollars and observed an under repair site with a third of the attractions and shops open. I would not recommend this park to my worst enemy....a big waste of money.",
          "Fun for the kids! Mine isn't old enough yet, so we didn't do rides. It's better than wild waves in Washington but ain't no silver wood in Idaho or Disneyland. But we had great family time! Probably not worth the season pass.",
          "We had a blast at E-world! A lot of rides and zoo. Alot of stuff to see. Make sure to visit the tower and eat on the 77 floor revolving reataurant. So much fun! My first visit April 2013 with Family. I will definitly visit it again! :)",
          "Not the biggest theme park, but still plenty of fun. Mini rollercoasters and a few fun up-side-downy rides. More rides there than I was expecting, but hardly a thrill seeker",
          "Not the most up to date park and some of the rides are sketchy but that's all in the experience. Its really about the people you go with. Be sure to take time to go up the tower and get a good view of the city. Also one of my favorite parts of the park was the trick eye museum",
          "This is a nice place to go if you have some time to spare. Nothing compared to a lot of themeparks in other countries, but the basics are there. A few rollercoasters, a flume ride, viking ship etc are all there. Tickets were approximately 28,000 per adult for a whole day (all"

        "wiki": "Daegu (Korean: [t\u025b\u0261u]; \ub300\uad6c, \u5927\u90b1, literally 'large hill'\ub300\uad6c\uad11\uc5ed\uc2dc), formerly spelled Taegu and officially known as the Daegu Metropolitan City, is a city in South Korea, the fourth-largest after Seoul, Busan, and Incheon and the third-largest metropolitan area in the nation with over 2.5 million residents. Also, it is the second largest city in the Yeongnam region after Busan. However, it is the fourth city in terms of population after Seoul, Busan and Incheon. It was overtaken by Incheon in the 2000s, but still it is said to be the third city according to the \"Act on the Establishment of Daegu City and Incheon City\" (Act No. 3424 and April 13, 1981). Daegu and surrounding North Gyeongsang Province are often referred to as Daegu-Gyeongbuk, with a total population over 5 million. \nDaegu is located in south-eastern Korea about 80 km (50 mi) from the seacoast, near the Geumho River and its mainstream, Nakdong River in Gyeongsang-do. The Daegu basin is the central plain of the Yeongnam region. In ancient times, the Daegu area was part of the proto-kingdom Jinhan. Subsequently, Daegu came under the control of the Silla Kingdom, which unified the Korean Peninsula. During the Joseon Dynasty period, the city was the capital of Gyeongsang-do, one of the traditional eight provinces of the country.\nDaegu was an economic motor of Korea during the 1960s\u20131980s period and was especially known for its electronics industry. The humid subtropical climate of Daegu is ideal for producing high-quality apples, thus the nickname, \"Apple City\". Daegu is also known as \"Textile City\". Textiles used to be the pillar industry of the city. With the establishment of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone, Daegu is currently focusing on fostering fashion and high-tech industries.\nDaegu was the host city of the 22nd World Energy Congress, the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, and the 2003 Summer Universiade. It also hosted four matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory and early history ===\nArchaeological investigations in the Greater Daegu area have revealed a large number of settlements and burials of the prehistoric Mumun Pottery Period (around 1500\u2013300 BC). In fact, some of the earliest evidence of Mumun settlement in Gyeongsangdo have been excavated from Siji-dong and Seobyeon-dong. Dongcheon-dong is one of the substantial Mumun agricultural villages that have been excavated. The Dongcheon-dong site dates back to the Middle Mumun (around 850\u2013550 BC) and contains the remains of many prehistoric pit-houses and agricultural fields. Megalithic burials (dolmens) have also been found in large numbers in Daegu.\nAncient historical texts indicate that during the Proto\u2013Three Kingdoms (Mahan, Jinhan, and Byeonhan) period, Daegu was the site of a chiefdom or walled-town polity known from that time, according to historical records, as Dalgubeol. It was absorbed into the kingdom of Silla no later than the fifth century. The vestiges of the wall can be seen, and relics have been excavated in the current Dalseong Park.\n\n\n=== Silla ===\nSilla succeeded in unifying the Korean peninsula by defeating the other kingdoms of Baekje and Koguryo in the late seventh century, partly due to assistance from China's Tang Dynasty. Shortly thereafter, in 689, Silla's King Sinmun considered moving the capital from Gyeongju to Daegu, but was unable to do so.  This initiative is known only through a single line in the Samguk Sagi, a most valued historical record of ancient Korea by Koryeo Dynasty historian Kim Bu-sik, but it is presumed to indicate both an attempt by the Silla king to reinforce royal authority and the entrenched resistance of the Gyeongju political elites that was the likely cause of the move's failure. The city was given its current name in 757.\nIn the late 1990s, archaeologists excavated a large-scale fortified Silla site in Dongcheon-dong, Buk-gu. The site at Locality 2 consists of the remains of 39 raised-floor buildings enclosed by a formidable ditch-and-palisade system. The excavators hypothesize that the fortified site was a permanent military encampment or barracks. Archaeologists also uncovered a large Silla village dating to the sixth to seventh centuries AD at Siji-dong.\n\n\n=== Later Three Kingdoms and Goryeo ===\nDuring the Later Three Kingdoms period, 892\u2013936, Daegu was initially aligned with Hubaekje. In 927, northern Daegu was the site of the Battle of Gong Mountain between the forces of Goryeo under Wang Geon and those of Hubaekje under Gyeon Hwon. In this battle, the forces of Goryeo were crushed and Wang Geon himself was saved only by the heroic deed of his general Shin Sung-gyeom. However,  the atrocities of the Hubaekje forces at this time apparently changed local sympathizers to favor Wang Geon, who later became the king of Goryeo.\nNumerous place names and local legends in the area still bear witness to the historic battle of 927. Among these are \"Ansim\", which literally means \"peace of mind\", said to be the first place where Wang Geon dared to stop after escaping the battle, and \"Banwol\", or half-moon, where he is said to have stopped and admired the moon before returning to Goryeo. A statue commemorating the battle now stands in northern Daegu, as does a memorial to Sin Sunggyeom.\nIn the Goryeo period, the first edition of the Tripitaka Koreana was stored in Daegu, at the temple of Buinsa.  However, this edition was destroyed when the temple was sacked in 1254, during the Mongol invasions of Korea.\n\n\n=== Joseon ===\n\nDaegu served as an important transportation center during the Joseon Dynasty. She stands in the mid part of the Great Yeongnam Road which ran between Seoul and Busan. It lay at the junction of this arterial road and the roads to Gyeongju and Jinju.\nIn 1601, Daegu became the administrative capital of the Gyeongsang-do, which is current Daegu, Busan, Ulsan, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and Gyeongsangnam-do. At about that time, the city began to grow into a major city. The status continued for nearly 300 years, and the city has been transformed as the capital of Gyeongsangbuk-do since Gyeongsang-do was divided into two provinces, Gyeongsangbuk-do (northern Gyeongsang-province) and Gyeongsangnam-do (southern one) in 1896.\nDaegu's first regular markets were established during the late Joseon period. The most famous of these is the Yangnyeongsi herbal medicine market. This became a center of herbal trade in Joseon, and even attracted buyers from neighboring countries. Traders from Japan, who were not permitted to leave the Nakdong River valley, hired messengers to visit the market on their behalf. Seomun Market, which stood at the city's west gate at that time, was one of the top-three markets in the Joseon period.\n\n\n=== Korean Empire and colonial rule ===\nThe Korean hermit kingdom finally opened itself to the outside world in the late 19th century. In 1895, Daegu became the site of one of the country's first modern post offices, as a part of the 'Gab-o' reforms introduced in the aftermath of the Sino-Japanese war.Beginning in the late 1890s, increasing numbers of foreign merchants and workers started to visit Daegu, which emerged as a modern transportation center of the newly constructed Gyeongbu Line main railroad connecting Seoul and Busan.\nIn 1905, the old fortress wall was forcibly destroyed. The wall still survives only in the street names such as the streets Dongseongno and Bukseongno, \"east fortress street\" and \"north fortress street\", which now run where the wall once stood.\nIndependence movements against imperial aggressions were outstanding in Daegu. These began as early as 1898, when a branch of the Independence Club was opened in the town.  As the demise of the Korean Empire approached in 1907, local citizens led by Seo Sang-don organized the National Debt Repayment Movement. The movement spread nationwide, although it fell short of repaying the national debt through individual donations. Freedom fighting continued after the 1910 annexation, notably during the March 1st movement of 1919. At that time, four major demonstrations took place in Daegu, involving an estimated 23,000 peace-loving citizens.\n\n\n=== After 1945 ===\nIn 1946, the Daegu October Incident took place, one of the most serious social disorders since the foundation of the Republic of Korea. An operation by the Korean national police to take control of rioters on October 1 resulted in the death of three student demonstrators and injuries to many others, sparking a massive counter-attack, killing as many as 38 policemen. It was also the site of major demonstrations on February 28, 1960, prior to the presidential election of that year.Daegu and all of North Gyeongsang province had heavy guerrilla activities in the late 1940s, as thousands of refugees shied away from the fighting in Jeolla province and sought shelters in Daegu.  In November 1948, a unit in Daegu joined the mutiny which had begun in Yeosu the previous month.During the Korean War, heavy fighting occurred nearby along the Nakdong River. Daegu sat inside the Pusan Perimeter, however, so remained in South Korean hands throughout the war. As in many other areas during the Korean War, political killings of dissenters were widespread. A large series of engagements was fought around the city to prevent North Korean troops from crossing the Nakdong, the Battle of Taegu.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the city underwent explosive growth, and the population has increased more than tenfold since the end of the Korean War. The city was politically favored during the 18-year-long rule of Park Chung-hee, when it and the surrounding area served as his political base. Daegu champions conservative political ideas and movements today and is a political base for the Saenuri Party.\nIn the 1980s, Daegu separated from Gyeongsangbuk-do and became a separately administered provincial-level directly governed city (Jikhalsi), and was redesignated as a metropolitan city (Gwangyeoksi) in 1995. Today, Daegu is the third-largest metropolitan area in Korea with respect to both population and commerce.\nIn February 2020, Daegu became known for the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nTwo local governments are in the city, the Daegu Metropolitan Government in Jung District and Gyeongbuk Provincial Government in Buk District. The provincial government will be relocated to Andong in its proper province, Gyeongbuk. The mayor and heads of city's eight districts are directly elected by the citizens every four years. The city council has 29 members which consist of 26 from the same number of electoral districts and three proportional representations. They are also directly elected every four years. Most of them are the members of the Liberty Korea Party, the main conservative political party in South Korea. Daegu is a stronghold for the party and has produced two Presidents of the Republic of Korea thus far: Roh Tae-woo and Park Geun-hye. As the capital of the Korean conservatives, the city has wielded strong political influence in elections.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nDaegu is divided into 7 districts (Gu) and 1 county (Gun)\n\nJung District (\uc911\uad6c, \u4e2d\u5340) \u2013 means the central district.\nDong District (\ub3d9\uad6c, \u6771\u5340) \u2013 means the east district.\nSeo District (\uc11c\uad6c, \u897f\u5340) \u2013 means the west district.\nNam District (\ub0a8\uad6c, \u5357\u5340) \u2013 means the south district.\nBuk District (\ubd81\uad6c, \u5317\u5340) \u2013 means the north district.\nSuseong District (\uc218\uc131\uad6c, \u58fd\u57ce\u5340)\nDalseo District (\ub2ec\uc11c\uad6c, \u9054\u897f\u5340)\nDalseong County (\ub2ec\uc131\uad70, \u9054\u57ce\u90e1)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nDaegu sits in a basin surrounded by low mountains. Palgongsan to the north, Biseulsan to the south, Waryongsan to the west, and a series of smaller hills in the east. The Geumho River flows along the northern and eastern edges of the city, emptying in the Nakdong River west of the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDaegu has a cooler version of a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa). In Holdridge climate classification, Daegu has a warm temperate moist forest climate. The mountains that comprise the basin trap hot and humid air. Similarly, in winter, cold air lies in the basin. The area receives little precipitation except during the rainy season of summer, and is sunny throughout much of the year. Data gathered since 1961 indicates that the mean temperature for January, the coldest month in Daegu, is 0.6 \u00b0C (33 \u00b0F) and that for August, the warmest month, is 26.4 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F). The City's lowest record temperature was \u221220.2 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F), and the City's highest record temperature was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F). The 40 degrees Celsius recorded in 1942 is also the highest temperature record in South Korea since the observation. This summer temperature has led to the emergence of a new term called Dae-Prika (Daegu+Africa) starting with the Internet community, and has recently been used in the media, broadcasting, etc. \n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nDaegu is a manufacturing industry city. The major industries are textiles, metals and machinery. In the year 2010, Daegu had a regional GDP of $45,387 million with 7.2% real GDP growth rate. The GDP per capita though is well below Korea national average. Many companies such as Daegu Bank, Korea Delphi, Hwasung corp., and TaeguTec are situated in this city, and Samsung and Kolon were founded here. Numerous factories are located in the industrial complexes situated in the west and north sides of the city including the Seongseo Industrial Complex, West Daegu Industrial Complex and the Daegu Dyeing Industrial Complex.\nThe city is the economic and industrial core of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk region, one of the major industrial areas in Korea. It accounted for as much as 94 percent of Korea's trade surplus in 2006. The electronics industries in Gumi and the steel industries in Pohang provided great services to that surplus. World-leading manufacturing facilities for Anycall (Samsung Mobile) and POSCO's main factories are located near the city. Daegu and its neighbouring cities were designated for the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone by the central government in 2008. It is specialized companies like Winitech software company in knowledge-based service and manufacturing industries.\nHistorically, Daegu has been the commercial center of the southern part of the Korean Peninsula with Seoul in the center and Pyongyang in the north (currently North Korea), because of its advantageous location. Some of the large, traditional markets like Seomun Market are still flourishing in the city.\nAdditionally, Daegu was considered the third major economic city in Korea, after Seoul and Busan. However, due to the decline of the textile industry, which is the heart of Daegu's economy, the overall economic growth of the city has also fallen.\nAlso, the city is the warmest region in South Korea due to the humid subtropical climate. This climate condition provides the region with high quality apples and oriental melons. The fruit industry is a crucial support for the local economy. Due to the stagnant economy, Daegu's population began to decrease after 2003. Recently, the local government has begun focusing on working towards economic revival and concentrating on improving the city's fashion industry.\n\n\n=== Fashion industry ===\nBeginning in the late 1990s, Daegu has been actively making efforts to promote its fashion industry based on its textile and clothing manufacturing industries under the 'Daegu: Fashion City'. The city opens many exhibitions related to the fashion and textile industries including the Daegu Fashion Fair and Preview in Daegu annually or semi-annually, and invites national institutes. A large new town specializing in the textile-fashion industries is currently under construction in Bongmu-dong, northeastern Daegu. The district, officially named Esiapolis, takes aim at the fashion hub of East Asia. Textile complexes, textile-fashion institutions, an international school, fashion malls as well as residential areas plan to be developed in the district.\n\n\n== Culture and sightseeing ==\n\nGenerally Daegu is known as a conservative city. As well as being the largest inland city in the country beside Seoul it has become one of the major metropolitan areas in the nation. Traditionally, Buddhism has been strong; today there are still many temples. Confucianism is also popular in Daegu, with a large academy based in the city. Neon cross-topped spires of Christian churches can also be seen in the city.\n\n\n=== Sights ===\nThe most well-known sight of the city is the stone Buddha called Gatbawi on the top of Gwanbong, Palgongsan. It is famous for its stone gat (Korean traditional hat). People from all over the country visit the place, because they believe that the Buddha will grant one's single desire. Administratively, the site itself is located in the neighboring city, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk.\n\nOn the outskirts of the city, mountains keep many traditional temples such as Donghwasa, Pagyesa, and Buinsa. Donghwasa is a Buddhist temple that was built by Priest Geukdal-hwasang in 493, and many artifacts of the period are found around the temple. The International Tourist Zen Meditation Center is Korea's only Zen-themed center. Some lecture halls or memorial halls such as Dodong-seowon (\ub3c4\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9053\u6771\u66f8\u9662) and Nokdong-seowon (\ub179\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9e7f\u6d1e\u66f8\u9662) are also located in the suburbs.\nOld villages have been preserved, such as the Otgol village (Gyeongju Choi clan's original residence area) and the Inheung village (Nampyeong Mun's). In the urban area, the Joseon Dynasty's administrative or educational buildings including Gyeongsang-gamyeong (\uacbd\uc0c1\uac10\uc601, \u6176\u5c19\u76e3\u71df) and Daegu-hyanggyo (\ub300\uad6c\ud5a5\uad50, \u5927\u90b1\u9115\u6821) also remain. The main gateway of the city in that period called Yeongnam-jeilmun (\uc601\ub0a8\uc81c\uc77c\ubb38, \u5dba\u5357\u7b2c\u4e00\u9580, meaning the first gateway in Yeongnam), has been restored in Mangudang Park. Western style modern architecture like Gyesan Cathedral and the old building of Jeil Church are preserved across the urban area. Gyesan Cathedral is the third oldest gothic church building in Korea and the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Daegu which is one of three archdioceses in South Korea. Several buildings, in the present Keisung Academy and the KNU middle/high school, are famous too.\nYangnyeongsi (\uc57d\ub839\uc2dc, \u85e5\u4ee4\u5e02) in Namseongno (often called Yakjeon-golmok) is the oldest market for Korean medicinal herbs in the country with a history of 350 years.

        "wiki": "Daegu (Korean: [t\u025b\u0261u]; \ub300\uad6c, \u5927\u90b1, literally 'large hill'\ub300\uad6c\uad11\uc5ed\uc2dc), formerly spelled Taegu and officially known as the Daegu Metropolitan City, is a city in South Korea, the fourth-largest after Seoul, Busan, and Incheon and the third-largest metropolitan area in the nation with over 2.5 million residents. Also, it is the second largest city in the Yeongnam region after Busan. However, it is the fourth city in terms of population after Seoul, Busan and Incheon. It was overtaken by Incheon in the 2000s, but still it is said to be the third city according to the \"Act on the Establishment of Daegu City and Incheon City\" (Act No. 3424 and April 13, 1981). Daegu and surrounding North Gyeongsang Province are often referred to as Daegu-Gyeongbuk, with a total population over 5 million. \nDaegu is located in south-eastern Korea about 80 km (50 mi) from the seacoast, near the Geumho River and its mainstream, Nakdong River in Gyeongsang-do. The Daegu basin is the central plain of the Yeongnam region. In ancient times, the Daegu area was part of the proto-kingdom Jinhan. Subsequently, Daegu came under the control of the Silla Kingdom, which unified the Korean Peninsula. During the Joseon Dynasty period, the city was the capital of Gyeongsang-do, one of the traditional eight provinces of the country.\nDaegu was an economic motor of Korea during the 1960s\u20131980s period and was especially known for its electronics industry. The humid subtropical climate of Daegu is ideal for producing high-quality apples, thus the nickname, \"Apple City\". Daegu is also known as \"Textile City\". Textiles used to be the pillar industry of the city. With the establishment of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone, Daegu is currently focusing on fostering fashion and high-tech industries.\nDaegu was the host city of the 22nd World Energy Congress, the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, and the 2003 Summer Universiade. It also hosted four matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory and early history ===\nArchaeological investigations in the Greater Daegu area have revealed a large number of settlements and burials of the prehistoric Mumun Pottery Period (around 1500\u2013300 BC). In fact, some of the earliest evidence of Mumun settlement in Gyeongsangdo have been excavated from Siji-dong and Seobyeon-dong. Dongcheon-dong is one of the substantial Mumun agricultural villages that have been excavated. The Dongcheon-dong site dates back to the Middle Mumun (around 850\u2013550 BC) and contains the remains of many prehistoric pit-houses and agricultural fields. Megalithic burials (dolmens) have also been found in large numbers in Daegu.\nAncient historical texts indicate that during the Proto\u2013Three Kingdoms (Mahan, Jinhan, and Byeonhan) period, Daegu was the site of a chiefdom or walled-town polity known from that time, according to historical records, as Dalgubeol. It was absorbed into the kingdom of Silla no later than the fifth century. The vestiges of the wall can be seen, and relics have been excavated in the current Dalseong Park.\n\n\n=== Silla ===\nSilla succeeded in unifying the Korean peninsula by defeating the other kingdoms of Baekje and Koguryo in the late seventh century, partly due to assistance from China's Tang Dynasty. Shortly thereafter, in 689, Silla's King Sinmun considered moving the capital from Gyeongju to Daegu, but was unable to do so.  This initiative is known only through a single line in the Samguk Sagi, a most valued historical record of ancient Korea by Koryeo Dynasty historian Kim Bu-sik, but it is presumed to indicate both an attempt by the Silla king to reinforce royal authority and the entrenched resistance of the Gyeongju political elites that was the likely cause of the move's failure. The city was given its current name in 757.\nIn the late 1990s, archaeologists excavated a large-scale fortified Silla site in Dongcheon-dong, Buk-gu. The site at Locality 2 consists of the remains of 39 raised-floor buildings enclosed by a formidable ditch-and-palisade system. The excavators hypothesize that the fortified site was a permanent military encampment or barracks. Archaeologists also uncovered a large Silla village dating to the sixth to seventh centuries AD at Siji-dong.\n\n\n=== Later Three Kingdoms and Goryeo ===\nDuring the Later Three Kingdoms period, 892\u2013936, Daegu was initially aligned with Hubaekje. In 927, northern Daegu was the site of the Battle of Gong Mountain between the forces of Goryeo under Wang Geon and those of Hubaekje under Gyeon Hwon. In this battle, the forces of Goryeo were crushed and Wang Geon himself was saved only by the heroic deed of his general Shin Sung-gyeom. However,  the atrocities of the Hubaekje forces at this time apparently changed local sympathizers to favor Wang Geon, who later became the king of Goryeo.\nNumerous place names and local legends in the area still bear witness to the historic battle of 927. Among these are \"Ansim\", which literally means \"peace of mind\", said to be the first place where Wang Geon dared to stop after escaping the battle, and \"Banwol\", or half-moon, where he is said to have stopped and admired the moon before returning to Goryeo. A statue commemorating the battle now stands in northern Daegu, as does a memorial to Sin Sunggyeom.\nIn the Goryeo period, the first edition of the Tripitaka Koreana was stored in Daegu, at the temple of Buinsa.  However, this edition was destroyed when the temple was sacked in 1254, during the Mongol invasions of Korea.\n\n\n=== Joseon ===\n\nDaegu served as an important transportation center during the Joseon Dynasty. She stands in the mid part of the Great Yeongnam Road which ran between Seoul and Busan. It lay at the junction of this arterial road and the roads to Gyeongju and Jinju.\nIn 1601, Daegu became the administrative capital of the Gyeongsang-do, which is current Daegu, Busan, Ulsan, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and Gyeongsangnam-do. At about that time, the city began to grow into a major city. The status continued for nearly 300 years, and the city has been transformed as the capital of Gyeongsangbuk-do since Gyeongsang-do was divided into two provinces, Gyeongsangbuk-do (northern Gyeongsang-province) and Gyeongsangnam-do (southern one) in 1896.\nDaegu's first regular markets were established during the late Joseon period. The most famous of these is the Yangnyeongsi herbal medicine market. This became a center of herbal trade in Joseon, and even attracted buyers from neighboring countries. Traders from Japan, who were not permitted to leave the Nakdong River valley, hired messengers to visit the market on their behalf. Seomun Market, which stood at the city's west gate at that time, was one of the top-three markets in the Joseon period.\n\n\n=== Korean Empire and colonial rule ===\nThe Korean hermit kingdom finally opened itself to the outside world in the late 19th century. In 1895, Daegu became the site of one of the country's first modern post offices, as a part of the 'Gab-o' reforms introduced in the aftermath of the Sino-Japanese war.Beginning in the late 1890s, increasing numbers of foreign merchants and workers started to visit Daegu, which emerged as a modern transportation center of the newly constructed Gyeongbu Line main railroad connecting Seoul and Busan.\nIn 1905, the old fortress wall was forcibly destroyed. The wall still survives only in the street names such as the streets Dongseongno and Bukseongno, \"east fortress street\" and \"north fortress street\", which now run where the wall once stood.\nIndependence movements against imperial aggressions were outstanding in Daegu. These began as early as 1898, when a branch of the Independence Club was opened in the town.  As the demise of the Korean Empire approached in 1907, local citizens led by Seo Sang-don organized the National Debt Repayment Movement. The movement spread nationwide, although it fell short of repaying the national debt through individual donations. Freedom fighting continued after the 1910 annexation, notably during the March 1st movement of 1919. At that time, four major demonstrations took place in Daegu, involving an estimated 23,000 peace-loving citizens.\n\n\n=== After 1945 ===\nIn 1946, the Daegu October Incident took place, one of the most serious social disorders since the foundation of the Republic of Korea. An operation by the Korean national police to take control of rioters on October 1 resulted in the death of three student demonstrators and injuries to many others, sparking a massive counter-attack, killing as many as 38 policemen. It was also the site of major demonstrations on February 28, 1960, prior to the presidential election of that year.Daegu and all of North Gyeongsang province had heavy guerrilla activities in the late 1940s, as thousands of refugees shied away from the fighting in Jeolla province and sought shelters in Daegu.  In November 1948, a unit in Daegu joined the mutiny which had begun in Yeosu the previous month.During the Korean War, heavy fighting occurred nearby along the Nakdong River. Daegu sat inside the Pusan Perimeter, however, so remained in South Korean hands throughout the war. As in many other areas during the Korean War, political killings of dissenters were widespread. A large series of engagements was fought around the city to prevent North Korean troops from crossing the Nakdong, the Battle of Taegu.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the city underwent explosive growth, and the population has increased more than tenfold since the end of the Korean War. The city was politically favored during the 18-year-long rule of Park Chung-hee, when it and the surrounding area served as his political base. Daegu champions conservative political ideas and movements today and is a political base for the Saenuri Party.\nIn the 1980s, Daegu separated from Gyeongsangbuk-do and became a separately administered provincial-level directly governed city (Jikhalsi), and was redesignated as a metropolitan city (Gwangyeoksi) in 1995. Today, Daegu is the third-largest metropolitan area in Korea with respect to both population and commerce.\nIn February 2020, Daegu became known for the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nTwo local governments are in the city, the Daegu Metropolitan Government in Jung District and Gyeongbuk Provincial Government in Buk District. The provincial government will be relocated to Andong in its proper province, Gyeongbuk. The mayor and heads of city's eight districts are directly elected by the citizens every four years. The city council has 29 members which consist of 26 from the same number of electoral districts and three proportional representations. They are also directly elected every four years. Most of them are the members of the Liberty Korea Party, the main conservative political party in South Korea. Daegu is a stronghold for the party and has produced two Presidents of the Republic of Korea thus far: Roh Tae-woo and Park Geun-hye. As the capital of the Korean conservatives, the city has wielded strong political influence in elections.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nDaegu is divided into 7 districts (Gu) and 1 county (Gun)\n\nJung District (\uc911\uad6c, \u4e2d\u5340) \u2013 means the central district.\nDong District (\ub3d9\uad6c, \u6771\u5340) \u2013 means the east district.\nSeo District (\uc11c\uad6c, \u897f\u5340) \u2013 means the west district.\nNam District (\ub0a8\uad6c, \u5357\u5340) \u2013 means the south district.\nBuk District (\ubd81\uad6c, \u5317\u5340) \u2013 means the north district.\nSuseong District (\uc218\uc131\uad6c, \u58fd\u57ce\u5340)\nDalseo District (\ub2ec\uc11c\uad6c, \u9054\u897f\u5340)\nDalseong County (\ub2ec\uc131\uad70, \u9054\u57ce\u90e1)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nDaegu sits in a basin surrounded by low mountains. Palgongsan to the north, Biseulsan to the south, Waryongsan to the west, and a series of smaller hills in the east. The Geumho River flows along the northern and eastern edges of the city, emptying in the Nakdong River west of the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDaegu has a cooler version of a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa). In Holdridge climate classification, Daegu has a warm temperate moist forest climate. The mountains that comprise the basin trap hot and humid air. Similarly, in winter, cold air lies in the basin. The area receives little precipitation except during the rainy season of summer, and is sunny throughout much of the year. Data gathered since 1961 indicates that the mean temperature for January, the coldest month in Daegu, is 0.6 \u00b0C (33 \u00b0F) and that for August, the warmest month, is 26.4 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F). The City's lowest record temperature was \u221220.2 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F), and the City's highest record temperature was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F). The 40 degrees Celsius recorded in 1942 is also the highest temperature record in South Korea since the observation. This summer temperature has led to the emergence of a new term called Dae-Prika (Daegu+Africa) starting with the Internet community, and has recently been used in the media, broadcasting, etc. \n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nDaegu is a manufacturing industry city. The major industries are textiles, metals and machinery. In the year 2010, Daegu had a regional GDP of $45,387 million with 7.2% real GDP growth rate. The GDP per capita though is well below Korea national average. Many companies such as Daegu Bank, Korea Delphi, Hwasung corp., and TaeguTec are situated in this city, and Samsung and Kolon were founded here. Numerous factories are located in the industrial complexes situated in the west and north sides of the city including the Seongseo Industrial Complex, West Daegu Industrial Complex and the Daegu Dyeing Industrial Complex.\nThe city is the economic and industrial core of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk region, one of the major industrial areas in Korea. It accounted for as much as 94 percent of Korea's trade surplus in 2006. The electronics industries in Gumi and the steel industries in Pohang provided great services to that surplus. World-leading manufacturing facilities for Anycall (Samsung Mobile) and POSCO's main factories are located near the city. Daegu and its neighbouring cities were designated for the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone by the central government in 2008. It is specialized companies like Winitech software company in knowledge-based service and manufacturing industries.\nHistorically, Daegu has been the commercial center of the southern part of the Korean Peninsula with Seoul in the center and Pyongyang in the north (currently North Korea), because of its advantageous location. Some of the large, traditional markets like Seomun Market are still flourishing in the city.\nAdditionally, Daegu was considered the third major economic city in Korea, after Seoul and Busan. However, due to the decline of the textile industry, which is the heart of Daegu's economy, the overall economic growth of the city has also fallen.\nAlso, the city is the warmest region in South Korea due to the humid subtropical climate. This climate condition provides the region with high quality apples and oriental melons. The fruit industry is a crucial support for the local economy. Due to the stagnant economy, Daegu's population began to decrease after 2003. Recently, the local government has begun focusing on working towards economic revival and concentrating on improving the city's fashion industry.\n\n\n=== Fashion industry ===\nBeginning in the late 1990s, Daegu has been actively making efforts to promote its fashion industry based on its textile and clothing manufacturing industries under the 'Daegu: Fashion City'. The city opens many exhibitions related to the fashion and textile industries including the Daegu Fashion Fair and Preview in Daegu annually or semi-annually, and invites national institutes. A large new town specializing in the textile-fashion industries is currently under construction in Bongmu-dong, northeastern Daegu. The district, officially named Esiapolis, takes aim at the fashion hub of East Asia. Textile complexes, textile-fashion institutions, an international school, fashion malls as well as residential areas plan to be developed in the district.\n\n\n== Culture and sightseeing ==\n\nGenerally Daegu is known as a conservative city. As well as being the largest inland city in the country beside Seoul it has become one of the major metropolitan areas in the nation. Traditionally, Buddhism has been strong; today there are still many temples. Confucianism is also popular in Daegu, with a large academy based in the city. Neon cross-topped spires of Christian churches can also be seen in the city.\n\n\n=== Sights ===\nThe most well-known sight of the city is the stone Buddha called Gatbawi on the top of Gwanbong, Palgongsan. It is famous for its stone gat (Korean traditional hat). People from all over the country visit the place, because they believe that the Buddha will grant one's single desire. Administratively, the site itself is located in the neighboring city, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk.\n\nOn the outskirts of the city, mountains keep many traditional temples such as Donghwasa, Pagyesa, and Buinsa. Donghwasa is a Buddhist temple that was built by Priest Geukdal-hwasang in 493, and many artifacts of the period are found around the temple. The International Tourist Zen Meditation Center is Korea's only Zen-themed center. Some lecture halls or memorial halls such as Dodong-seowon (\ub3c4\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9053\u6771\u66f8\u9662) and Nokdong-seowon (\ub179\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9e7f\u6d1e\u66f8\u9662) are also located in the suburbs.\nOld villages have been preserved, such as the Otgol village (Gyeongju Choi clan's original residence area) and the Inheung village (Nampyeong Mun's). In the urban area, the Joseon Dynasty's administrative or educational buildings including Gyeongsang-gamyeong (\uacbd\uc0c1\uac10\uc601, \u6176\u5c19\u76e3\u71df) and Daegu-hyanggyo (\ub300\uad6c\ud5a5\uad50, \u5927\u90b1\u9115\u6821) also remain. The main gateway of the city in that period called Yeongnam-jeilmun (\uc601\ub0a8\uc81c\uc77c\ubb38, \u5dba\u5357\u7b2c\u4e00\u9580, meaning the first gateway in Yeongnam), has been restored in Mangudang Park. Western style modern architecture like Gyesan Cathedral and the old building of Jeil Church are preserved across the urban area. Gyesan Cathedral is the third oldest gothic church building in Korea and the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Daegu which is one of three archdioceses in South Korea. Several buildings, in the present Keisung Academy and the KNU middle/high school, are famous too.\nYangnyeongsi (\uc57d\ub839\uc2dc, \u85e5\u4ee4\u5e02) in Namseongno (often called Yakjeon-golmok) is the oldest market for Korean medicinal herbs in the country with a history of 350 years. Bongsan-dong which has some art galleries and studios is being developed as the artistic center of the city since the 1990s.\nNearby tourist attractions include Haeinsa\u2014a Buddhist temple that houses the Tripitaka Koreana (a woodblock edition of the Tripitaka and one of the world's oldest extant complete collections of the Buddhist scriptures). Haeinsa is located in Gayasan National Park of Hapcheon, Gyeongnam. The historic city of Gyeongju, Gyeongbuk, the capital of the ancient kingdom of Silla is located east of Daegu.\n\n\n=== Mountains and parks ===\n\nMt. Palgong, Mt. Biseul, and Mt. Ap are the representative mountains in Daegu. Apsan, just in the southern part of the city, is the closest mountain from the urban area among them. It has many trails, Buddhist temples, a Korean War museum, and a gondola ride to the peak. Additionally, Waryongsan, Hamjisan, and Yongjibong are located in the city. These serve as neighborhood parks to the citizens. Mt. Palgong has a cable car to the summit. There are also hiking trails in the direction of the Donghwasa Temple and Sutaegol Valley.\nIn the urban area, several small mountains and hills play the same role. Dalseong Park, which sits inside a 1,500-year-old earth fortress, is a historic place of the city. It contains the city's only zoo and some monuments as well as the wall. Duryu Park or Duryusan is a large forest in the middle of the urban area. It has Daegu Tower, Woobang Land, Kolon Bandstand, Duryu Stadium, and many sports facilities. Daegu Tower, also called Woobang Tower or Duryu Tower, is the tallest contemporary structure (202 m) and a symbol of the city. Its observatory commands good views of the surroundings. Woobang Land is the largest amusement park out of the capital area. Many small gardens lie in the heart of the city, such as the National Debt Repayment Movement Memorial Park (Gukchae Bosang Park) and 2\u00b728 Park. The former park includes Dalgubeol-daejong (\ub2ec\uad6c\ubc8c\ub300\uc885, \u9054\u53e5\u4f10\u5927\u9418), which means the Dalgubeol grand bell. The bell is struck every week and year. There is also a botanical garden with a variety of plants and flowers.\n\n\n=== Downtown and shopping ===\nDongseongno (\ub3d9\uc131\ub85c, \u6771\u57ce\u8def) is the downtown of Daegu lying from the Daegu Station to Jung-ang pachulso (central police station) near the Banwoldang subway station in the center of the city Jung-gu. It has the Jung-angno subway station as the nearest station from its heart. Like its name meaning the street in the east fortress, the eastern part of Daegu-eupseong (\ub300\uad6c\uc74d\uc131, \u5927\u90b1\u9091\u57ce, means the Daegu-Principality Fortress) was situated along this street. The fortress, however, had been demolished in the early 20th century. Although Daegu is the nation's third or fourth largest city, the Dongseongno area form the largest and the broadest downtown area in the whole country except the capital city, Seoul.  In most cases, famous brands open their branch shop first here out of the Greater Seoul area.\n\nSub-downtowns in the city have its own commercial powers and colors. The area around the Seongseo Industrial Complex subway station in Dalseo-gu is a concentration of many amusement spots, and young people easily can be seen around Kyungpook National University in Buk-gu. Deuran-gil (means the street inside the field) in Suseong-gu is known for many restaurants.\nThe city has a number of department stores. Many of these belong to national or multinational chains, but the local Daegu Department Store also operates two branches, while another local chain, Donga Department Store operates four in the city proper. The six department stores among them gather at the downtown. The traditional markets such as Seomun Market and Chilseong Market sell all sorts of goods.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nMany traditional ceremonies and festivals in agrarian society disappeared in the process of modernization. A Confucian ritual ceremony called Seokjeondaeje is held at Daegu-hyanggyo every spring and autumn. The Yangnyeongsi herb medical festival and Otgol village festival are the contemporary festivals about traditional culture.\nLately in the city, enthusiasm about performing arts is growing and the local government is trying to meet its demand. Daegu International Opera Festival (DIOF) in October since 2003, Daegu International Musical Festival (DIMF), and Daegu International Bodypainting Festival (DIBF) are three of the most famous festivals on each field in Korea, although those have short histories.\nVarious festivals in various themes like the Colorful Daegu Festival, Dongseongno festival, Palgongsan maple festival, Biseulsan azalea festival, Korea in Motion Daegu, and so on, are held by the city, each ward, or the specific groups, all through the year.\nOn August 25 through August 31, 2008, Daegu hosted the first ever Asian Bodypainting Festival, a sister event of the World Bodypainting Festival in Seeboden, Austria.\nEach year the city is home to the Daegu International Jazz Festival: http://www.dijf.or.kr/\nEvery May the \"Colorful Daegu Festival\" offers performances and art programs including the Colorful Parade. In July, the Daegu Chimac Festival takes place at Duryu Park in Dalseo-gu, Daegu. The term \"chimac\" is a portmanteau of chicken and maekju (meaning \"beer\"). There were over 880,000 visitors in 2015, and one million visitors during the festival in 2016.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nDaegu Art Museum\nDaegu National Museum \u2013 A notable national museum collecting relics excavated in and around Daegu\nDaegu Bangjja Yugi (Korean Bronzeware) Museum\nHengso Museum of Keimyung University\nKorea Video Museum\nKyungpook National University Museum\nMuseum for Daegu National University of Education\nMuseum of Natural Dye Arts\n\n\n=== Theaters ===\nDaegu Opera House \u2013 The first theater in Korea only for performing opera\nSuseong Artpia\nKeimyung Art Center \u2013 One of the largest scale theaters in the city.\nDaegu Culture and Arts Center\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nOn March 27, 2007, the city was selected to host the 2011 World Championships in Athletics.

        "wiki": "Daegu (Korean: [t\u025b\u0261u]; \ub300\uad6c, \u5927\u90b1, literally 'large hill'\ub300\uad6c\uad11\uc5ed\uc2dc), formerly spelled Taegu and officially known as the Daegu Metropolitan City, is a city in South Korea, the fourth-largest after Seoul, Busan, and Incheon and the third-largest metropolitan area in the nation with over 2.5 million residents. Also, it is the second largest city in the Yeongnam region after Busan. However, it is the fourth city in terms of population after Seoul, Busan and Incheon. It was overtaken by Incheon in the 2000s, but still it is said to be the third city according to the \"Act on the Establishment of Daegu City and Incheon City\" (Act No. 3424 and April 13, 1981). Daegu and surrounding North Gyeongsang Province are often referred to as Daegu-Gyeongbuk, with a total population over 5 million. \nDaegu is located in south-eastern Korea about 80 km (50 mi) from the seacoast, near the Geumho River and its mainstream, Nakdong River in Gyeongsang-do. The Daegu basin is the central plain of the Yeongnam region. In ancient times, the Daegu area was part of the proto-kingdom Jinhan. Subsequently, Daegu came under the control of the Silla Kingdom, which unified the Korean Peninsula. During the Joseon Dynasty period, the city was the capital of Gyeongsang-do, one of the traditional eight provinces of the country.\nDaegu was an economic motor of Korea during the 1960s\u20131980s period and was especially known for its electronics industry. The humid subtropical climate of Daegu is ideal for producing high-quality apples, thus the nickname, \"Apple City\". Daegu is also known as \"Textile City\". Textiles used to be the pillar industry of the city. With the establishment of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone, Daegu is currently focusing on fostering fashion and high-tech industries.\nDaegu was the host city of the 22nd World Energy Congress, the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, and the 2003 Summer Universiade. It also hosted four matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory and early history ===\nArchaeological investigations in the Greater Daegu area have revealed a large number of settlements and burials of the prehistoric Mumun Pottery Period (around 1500\u2013300 BC). In fact, some of the earliest evidence of Mumun settlement in Gyeongsangdo have been excavated from Siji-dong and Seobyeon-dong. Dongcheon-dong is one of the substantial Mumun agricultural villages that have been excavated. The Dongcheon-dong site dates back to the Middle Mumun (around 850\u2013550 BC) and contains the remains of many prehistoric pit-houses and agricultural fields. Megalithic burials (dolmens) have also been found in large numbers in Daegu.\nAncient historical texts indicate that during the Proto\u2013Three Kingdoms (Mahan, Jinhan, and Byeonhan) period, Daegu was the site of a chiefdom or walled-town polity known from that time, according to historical records, as Dalgubeol. It was absorbed into the kingdom of Silla no later than the fifth century. The vestiges of the wall can be seen, and relics have been excavated in the current Dalseong Park.\n\n\n=== Silla ===\nSilla succeeded in unifying the Korean peninsula by defeating the other kingdoms of Baekje and Koguryo in the late seventh century, partly due to assistance from China's Tang Dynasty. Shortly thereafter, in 689, Silla's King Sinmun considered moving the capital from Gyeongju to Daegu, but was unable to do so.  This initiative is known only through a single line in the Samguk Sagi, a most valued historical record of ancient Korea by Koryeo Dynasty historian Kim Bu-sik, but it is presumed to indicate both an attempt by the Silla king to reinforce royal authority and the entrenched resistance of the Gyeongju political elites that was the likely cause of the move's failure. The city was given its current name in 757.\nIn the late 1990s, archaeologists excavated a large-scale fortified Silla site in Dongcheon-dong, Buk-gu. The site at Locality 2 consists of the remains of 39 raised-floor buildings enclosed by a formidable ditch-and-palisade system. The excavators hypothesize that the fortified site was a permanent military encampment or barracks. Archaeologists also uncovered a large Silla village dating to the sixth to seventh centuries AD at Siji-dong.\n\n\n=== Later Three Kingdoms and Goryeo ===\nDuring the Later Three Kingdoms period, 892\u2013936, Daegu was initially aligned with Hubaekje. In 927, northern Daegu was the site of the Battle of Gong Mountain between the forces of Goryeo under Wang Geon and those of Hubaekje under Gyeon Hwon. In this battle, the forces of Goryeo were crushed and Wang Geon himself was saved only by the heroic deed of his general Shin Sung-gyeom. However,  the atrocities of the Hubaekje forces at this time apparently changed local sympathizers to favor Wang Geon, who later became the king of Goryeo.\nNumerous place names and local legends in the area still bear witness to the historic battle of 927. Among these are \"Ansim\", which literally means \"peace of mind\", said to be the first place where Wang Geon dared to stop after escaping the battle, and \"Banwol\", or half-moon, where he is said to have stopped and admired the moon before returning to Goryeo. A statue commemorating the battle now stands in northern Daegu, as does a memorial to Sin Sunggyeom.\nIn the Goryeo period, the first edition of the Tripitaka Koreana was stored in Daegu, at the temple of Buinsa.  However, this edition was destroyed when the temple was sacked in 1254, during the Mongol invasions of Korea.\n\n\n=== Joseon ===\n\nDaegu served as an important transportation center during the Joseon Dynasty. She stands in the mid part of the Great Yeongnam Road which ran between Seoul and Busan. It lay at the junction of this arterial road and the roads to Gyeongju and Jinju.\nIn 1601, Daegu became the administrative capital of the Gyeongsang-do, which is current Daegu, Busan, Ulsan, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and Gyeongsangnam-do. At about that time, the city began to grow into a major city. The status continued for nearly 300 years, and the city has been transformed as the capital of Gyeongsangbuk-do since Gyeongsang-do was divided into two provinces, Gyeongsangbuk-do (northern Gyeongsang-province) and Gyeongsangnam-do (southern one) in 1896.\nDaegu's first regular markets were established during the late Joseon period. The most famous of these is the Yangnyeongsi herbal medicine market. This became a center of herbal trade in Joseon, and even attracted buyers from neighboring countries. Traders from Japan, who were not permitted to leave the Nakdong River valley, hired messengers to visit the market on their behalf. Seomun Market, which stood at the city's west gate at that time, was one of the top-three markets in the Joseon period.\n\n\n=== Korean Empire and colonial rule ===\nThe Korean hermit kingdom finally opened itself to the outside world in the late 19th century. In 1895, Daegu became the site of one of the country's first modern post offices, as a part of the 'Gab-o' reforms introduced in the aftermath of the Sino-Japanese war.Beginning in the late 1890s, increasing numbers of foreign merchants and workers started to visit Daegu, which emerged as a modern transportation center of the newly constructed Gyeongbu Line main railroad connecting Seoul and Busan.\nIn 1905, the old fortress wall was forcibly destroyed. The wall still survives only in the street names such as the streets Dongseongno and Bukseongno, \"east fortress street\" and \"north fortress street\", which now run where the wall once stood.\nIndependence movements against imperial aggressions were outstanding in Daegu. These began as early as 1898, when a branch of the Independence Club was opened in the town.  As the demise of the Korean Empire approached in 1907, local citizens led by Seo Sang-don organized the National Debt Repayment Movement. The movement spread nationwide, although it fell short of repaying the national debt through individual donations. Freedom fighting continued after the 1910 annexation, notably during the March 1st movement of 1919. At that time, four major demonstrations took place in Daegu, involving an estimated 23,000 peace-loving citizens.\n\n\n=== After 1945 ===\nIn 1946, the Daegu October Incident took place, one of the most serious social disorders since the foundation of the Republic of Korea. An operation by the Korean national police to take control of rioters on October 1 resulted in the death of three student demonstrators and injuries to many others, sparking a massive counter-attack, killing as many as 38 policemen. It was also the site of major demonstrations on February 28, 1960, prior to the presidential election of that year.Daegu and all of North Gyeongsang province had heavy guerrilla activities in the late 1940s, as thousands of refugees shied away from the fighting in Jeolla province and sought shelters in Daegu.  In November 1948, a unit in Daegu joined the mutiny which had begun in Yeosu the previous month.During the Korean War, heavy fighting occurred nearby along the Nakdong River. Daegu sat inside the Pusan Perimeter, however, so remained in South Korean hands throughout the war. As in many other areas during the Korean War, political killings of dissenters were widespread. A large series of engagements was fought around the city to prevent North Korean troops from crossing the Nakdong, the Battle of Taegu.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the city underwent explosive growth, and the population has increased more than tenfold since the end of the Korean War. The city was politically favored during the 18-year-long rule of Park Chung-hee, when it and the surrounding area served as his political base. Daegu champions conservative political ideas and movements today and is a political base for the Saenuri Party.\nIn the 1980s, Daegu separated from Gyeongsangbuk-do and became a separately administered provincial-level directly governed city (Jikhalsi), and was redesignated as a metropolitan city (Gwangyeoksi) in 1995. Today, Daegu is the third-largest metropolitan area in Korea with respect to both population and commerce.\nIn February 2020, Daegu became known for the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nTwo local governments are in the city, the Daegu Metropolitan Government in Jung District and Gyeongbuk Provincial Government in Buk District. The provincial government will be relocated to Andong in its proper province, Gyeongbuk. The mayor and heads of city's eight districts are directly elected by the citizens every four years. The city council has 29 members which consist of 26 from the same number of electoral districts and three proportional representations. They are also directly elected every four years. Most of them are the members of the Liberty Korea Party, the main conservative political party in South Korea. Daegu is a stronghold for the party and has produced two Presidents of the Republic of Korea thus far: Roh Tae-woo and Park Geun-hye. As the capital of the Korean conservatives, the city has wielded strong political influence in elections.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nDaegu is divided into 7 districts (Gu) and 1 county (Gun)\n\nJung District (\uc911\uad6c, \u4e2d\u5340) \u2013 means the central district.\nDong District (\ub3d9\uad6c, \u6771\u5340) \u2013 means the east district.\nSeo District (\uc11c\uad6c, \u897f\u5340) \u2013 means the west district.\nNam District (\ub0a8\uad6c, \u5357\u5340) \u2013 means the south district.\nBuk District (\ubd81\uad6c, \u5317\u5340) \u2013 means the north district.\nSuseong District (\uc218\uc131\uad6c, \u58fd\u57ce\u5340)\nDalseo District (\ub2ec\uc11c\uad6c, \u9054\u897f\u5340)\nDalseong County (\ub2ec\uc131\uad70, \u9054\u57ce\u90e1)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nDaegu sits in a basin surrounded by low mountains. Palgongsan to the north, Biseulsan to the south, Waryongsan to the west, and a series of smaller hills in the east. The Geumho River flows along the northern and eastern edges of the city, emptying in the Nakdong River west of the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDaegu has a cooler version of a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa). In Holdridge climate classification, Daegu has a warm temperate moist forest climate. The mountains that comprise the basin trap hot and humid air. Similarly, in winter, cold air lies in the basin. The area receives little precipitation except during the rainy season of summer, and is sunny throughout much of the year. Data gathered since 1961 indicates that the mean temperature for January, the coldest month in Daegu, is 0.6 \u00b0C (33 \u00b0F) and that for August, the warmest month, is 26.4 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F). The City's lowest record temperature was \u221220.2 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F), and the City's highest record temperature was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F). The 40 degrees Celsius recorded in 1942 is also the highest temperature record in South Korea since the observation. This summer temperature has led to the emergence of a new term called Dae-Prika (Daegu+Africa) starting with the Internet community, and has recently been used in the media, broadcasting, etc. \n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nDaegu is a manufacturing industry city. The major industries are textiles, metals and machinery. In the year 2010, Daegu had a regional GDP of $45,387 million with 7.2% real GDP growth rate. The GDP per capita though is well below Korea national average. Many companies such as Daegu Bank, Korea Delphi, Hwasung corp., and TaeguTec are situated in this city, and Samsung and Kolon were founded here. Numerous factories are located in the industrial complexes situated in the west and north sides of the city including the Seongseo Industrial Complex, West Daegu Industrial Complex and the Daegu Dyeing Industrial Complex.\nThe city is the economic and industrial core of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk region, one of the major industrial areas in Korea. It accounted for as much as 94 percent of Korea's trade surplus in 2006. The electronics industries in Gumi and the steel industries in Pohang provided great services to that surplus. World-leading manufacturing facilities for Anycall (Samsung Mobile) and POSCO's main factories are located near the city. Daegu and its neighbouring cities were designated for the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone by the central government in 2008. It is specialized companies like Winitech software company in knowledge-based service and manufacturing industries.\nHistorically, Daegu has been the commercial center of the southern part of the Korean Peninsula with Seoul in the center and Pyongyang in the north (currently North Korea), because of its advantageous location. Some of the large, traditional markets like Seomun Market are still flourishing in the city.\nAdditionally, Daegu was considered the third major economic city in Korea, after Seoul and Busan. However, due to the decline of the textile industry, which is the heart of Daegu's economy, the overall economic growth of the city has also fallen.\nAlso, the city is the warmest region in South Korea due to the humid subtropical climate. This climate condition provides the region with high quality apples and oriental melons. The fruit industry is a crucial support for the local economy. Due to the stagnant economy, Daegu's population began to decrease after 2003. Recently, the local government has begun focusing on working towards economic revival and concentrating on improving the city's fashion industry.\n\n\n=== Fashion industry ===\nBeginning in the late 1990s, Daegu has been actively making efforts to promote its fashion industry based on its textile and clothing manufacturing industries under the 'Daegu: Fashion City'. The city opens many exhibitions related to the fashion and textile industries including the Daegu Fashion Fair and Preview in Daegu annually or semi-annually, and invites national institutes. A large new town specializing in the textile-fashion industries is currently under construction in Bongmu-dong, northeastern Daegu. The district, officially named Esiapolis, takes aim at the fashion hub of East Asia. Textile complexes, textile-fashion institutions, an international school, fashion malls as well as residential areas plan to be developed in the district.\n\n\n== Culture and sightseeing ==\n\nGenerally Daegu is known as a conservative city. As well as being the largest inland city in the country beside Seoul it has become one of the major metropolitan areas in the nation. Traditionally, Buddhism has been strong; today there are still many temples. Confucianism is also popular in Daegu, with a large academy based in the city. Neon cross-topped spires of Christian churches can also be seen in the city.\n\n\n=== Sights ===\nThe most well-known sight of the city is the stone Buddha called Gatbawi on the top of Gwanbong, Palgongsan. It is famous for its stone gat (Korean traditional hat). People from all over the country visit the place, because they believe that the Buddha will grant one's single desire. Administratively, the site itself is located in the neighboring city, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk.\n\nOn the outskirts of the city, mountains keep many traditional temples such as Donghwasa, Pagyesa, and Buinsa. Donghwasa is a Buddhist temple that was built by Priest Geukdal-hwasang in 493, and many artifacts of the period are found around the temple. The International Tourist Zen Meditation Center is Korea's only Zen-themed center. Some lecture halls or memorial halls such as Dodong-seowon (\ub3c4\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9053\u6771\u66f8\u9662) and Nokdong-seowon (\ub179\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9e7f\u6d1e\u66f8\u9662) are also located in the suburbs.\nOld villages have been preserved, such as the Otgol village (Gyeongju Choi clan's original residence area) and the Inheung village (Nampyeong Mun's). In the urban area, the Joseon Dynasty's administrative or educational buildings including Gyeongsang-gamyeong (\uacbd\uc0c1\uac10\uc601, \u6176\u5c19\u76e3\u71df) and Daegu-hyanggyo (\ub300\uad6c\ud5a5\uad50, \u5927\u90b1\u9115\u6821) also remain.

        "wiki": "Daegu Stadium, also known as the Blue Arc, is a sports stadium located in Daegu, South Korea. It was formerly named Daegu World Cup Stadium but was changed to Daegu Stadium on 5 March 2008. It has a seating capacity for 66,422 people, and parking for 3,550 cars. It is located approximately 11 kilometers or 20 minutes by car from Daegu Airport. It is managed by the Daegu Sports Facilities Management Center.\nIt was one of the host venues of the 2002 FIFA World Cup and the main stadium for the 2003 Summer Universiade and the 2011 World Championships in Athletics. It was the home stadium of Daegu FC until 2018.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nThe construction was completed in May 2001 at a cost of 265,000,000 USD. The roof was engineered by the international consultancy WS Atkins. The roof is in two sections, each with an inclined trussed steel arch spanning 273 m for a rise of only 28.7 m, and propped by 13 secondary arches off a perimeter second \"arch\" that is supported by raking columns.

        "wiki": "Daegu (Korean: [t\u025b\u0261u]; \ub300\uad6c, \u5927\u90b1, literally 'large hill'\ub300\uad6c\uad11\uc5ed\uc2dc), formerly spelled Taegu and officially known as the Daegu Metropolitan City, is a city in South Korea, the fourth-largest after Seoul, Busan, and Incheon and the third-largest metropolitan area in the nation with over 2.5 million residents. Also, it is the second largest city in the Yeongnam region after Busan. However, it is the fourth city in terms of population after Seoul, Busan and Incheon. It was overtaken by Incheon in the 2000s, but still it is said to be the third city according to the \"Act on the Establishment of Daegu City and Incheon City\" (Act No. 3424 and April 13, 1981). Daegu and surrounding North Gyeongsang Province are often referred to as Daegu-Gyeongbuk, with a total population over 5 million. \nDaegu is located in south-eastern Korea about 80 km (50 mi) from the seacoast, near the Geumho River and its mainstream, Nakdong River in Gyeongsang-do. The Daegu basin is the central plain of the Yeongnam region. In ancient times, the Daegu area was part of the proto-kingdom Jinhan. Subsequently, Daegu came under the control of the Silla Kingdom, which unified the Korean Peninsula. During the Joseon Dynasty period, the city was the capital of Gyeongsang-do, one of the traditional eight provinces of the country.\nDaegu was an economic motor of Korea during the 1960s\u20131980s period and was especially known for its electronics industry. The humid subtropical climate of Daegu is ideal for producing high-quality apples, thus the nickname, \"Apple City\". Daegu is also known as \"Textile City\". Textiles used to be the pillar industry of the city. With the establishment of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone, Daegu is currently focusing on fostering fashion and high-tech industries.\nDaegu was the host city of the 22nd World Energy Congress, the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, and the 2003 Summer Universiade. It also hosted four matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory and early history ===\nArchaeological investigations in the Greater Daegu area have revealed a large number of settlements and burials of the prehistoric Mumun Pottery Period (around 1500\u2013300 BC). In fact, some of the earliest evidence of Mumun settlement in Gyeongsangdo have been excavated from Siji-dong and Seobyeon-dong. Dongcheon-dong is one of the substantial Mumun agricultural villages that have been excavated. The Dongcheon-dong site dates back to the Middle Mumun (around 850\u2013550 BC) and contains the remains of many prehistoric pit-houses and agricultural fields. Megalithic burials (dolmens) have also been found in large numbers in Daegu.\nAncient historical texts indicate that during the Proto\u2013Three Kingdoms (Mahan, Jinhan, and Byeonhan) period, Daegu was the site of a chiefdom or walled-town polity known from that time, according to historical records, as Dalgubeol. It was absorbed into the kingdom of Silla no later than the fifth century. The vestiges of the wall can be seen, and relics have been excavated in the current Dalseong Park.\n\n\n=== Silla ===\nSilla succeeded in unifying the Korean peninsula by defeating the other kingdoms of Baekje and Koguryo in the late seventh century, partly due to assistance from China's Tang Dynasty. Shortly thereafter, in 689, Silla's King Sinmun considered moving the capital from Gyeongju to Daegu, but was unable to do so.  This initiative is known only through a single line in the Samguk Sagi, a most valued historical record of ancient Korea by Koryeo Dynasty historian Kim Bu-sik, but it is presumed to indicate both an attempt by the Silla king to reinforce royal authority and the entrenched resistance of the Gyeongju political elites that was the likely cause of the move's failure. The city was given its current name in 757.\nIn the late 1990s, archaeologists excavated a large-scale fortified Silla site in Dongcheon-dong, Buk-gu. The site at Locality 2 consists of the remains of 39 raised-floor buildings enclosed by a formidable ditch-and-palisade system. The excavators hypothesize that the fortified site was a permanent military encampment or barracks. Archaeologists also uncovered a large Silla village dating to the sixth to seventh centuries AD at Siji-dong.\n\n\n=== Later Three Kingdoms and Goryeo ===\nDuring the Later Three Kingdoms period, 892\u2013936, Daegu was initially aligned with Hubaekje. In 927, northern Daegu was the site of the Battle of Gong Mountain between the forces of Goryeo under Wang Geon and those of Hubaekje under Gyeon Hwon. In this battle, the forces of Goryeo were crushed and Wang Geon himself was saved only by the heroic deed of his general Shin Sung-gyeom. However,  the atrocities of the Hubaekje forces at this time apparently changed local sympathizers to favor Wang Geon, who later became the king of Goryeo.\nNumerous place names and local legends in the area still bear witness to the historic battle of 927. Among these are \"Ansim\", which literally means \"peace of mind\", said to be the first place where Wang Geon dared to stop after escaping the battle, and \"Banwol\", or half-moon, where he is said to have stopped and admired the moon before returning to Goryeo. A statue commemorating the battle now stands in northern Daegu, as does a memorial to Sin Sunggyeom.\nIn the Goryeo period, the first edition of the Tripitaka Koreana was stored in Daegu, at the temple of Buinsa.  However, this edition was destroyed when the temple was sacked in 1254, during the Mongol invasions of Korea.\n\n\n=== Joseon ===\n\nDaegu served as an important transportation center during the Joseon Dynasty. She stands in the mid part of the Great Yeongnam Road which ran between Seoul and Busan. It lay at the junction of this arterial road and the roads to Gyeongju and Jinju.\nIn 1601, Daegu became the administrative capital of the Gyeongsang-do, which is current Daegu, Busan, Ulsan, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and Gyeongsangnam-do. At about that time, the city began to grow into a major city. The status continued for nearly 300 years, and the city has been transformed as the capital of Gyeongsangbuk-do since Gyeongsang-do was divided into two provinces, Gyeongsangbuk-do (northern Gyeongsang-province) and Gyeongsangnam-do (southern one) in 1896.\nDaegu's first regular markets were established during the late Joseon period. The most famous of these is the Yangnyeongsi herbal medicine market. This became a center of herbal trade in Joseon, and even attracted buyers from neighboring countries. Traders from Japan, who were not permitted to leave the Nakdong River valley, hired messengers to visit the market on their behalf. Seomun Market, which stood at the city's west gate at that time, was one of the top-three markets in the Joseon period.\n\n\n=== Korean Empire and colonial rule ===\nThe Korean hermit kingdom finally opened itself to the outside world in the late 19th century. In 1895, Daegu became the site of one of the country's first modern post offices, as a part of the 'Gab-o' reforms introduced in the aftermath of the Sino-Japanese war.Beginning in the late 1890s, increasing numbers of foreign merchants and workers started to visit Daegu, which emerged as a modern transportation center of the newly constructed Gyeongbu Line main railroad connecting Seoul and Busan.\nIn 1905, the old fortress wall was forcibly destroyed. The wall still survives only in the street names such as the streets Dongseongno and Bukseongno, \"east fortress street\" and \"north fortress street\", which now run where the wall once stood.\nIndependence movements against imperial aggressions were outstanding in Daegu. These began as early as 1898, when a branch of the Independence Club was opened in the town.  As the demise of the Korean Empire approached in 1907, local citizens led by Seo Sang-don organized the National Debt Repayment Movement. The movement spread nationwide, although it fell short of repaying the national debt through individual donations. Freedom fighting continued after the 1910 annexation, notably during the March 1st movement of 1919. At that time, four major demonstrations took place in Daegu, involving an estimated 23,000 peace-loving citizens.\n\n\n=== After 1945 ===\nIn 1946, the Daegu October Incident took place, one of the most serious social disorders since the foundation of the Republic of Korea. An operation by the Korean national police to take control of rioters on October 1 resulted in the death of three student demonstrators and injuries to many others, sparking a massive counter-attack, killing as many as 38 policemen. It was also the site of major demonstrations on February 28, 1960, prior to the presidential election of that year.Daegu and all of North Gyeongsang province had heavy guerrilla activities in the late 1940s, as thousands of refugees shied away from the fighting in Jeolla province and sought shelters in Daegu.  In November 1948, a unit in Daegu joined the mutiny which had begun in Yeosu the previous month.During the Korean War, heavy fighting occurred nearby along the Nakdong River. Daegu sat inside the Pusan Perimeter, however, so remained in South Korean hands throughout the war. As in many other areas during the Korean War, political killings of dissenters were widespread. A large series of engagements was fought around the city to prevent North Korean troops from crossing the Nakdong, the Battle of Taegu.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the city underwent explosive growth, and the population has increased more than tenfold since the end of the Korean War. The city was politically favored during the 18-year-long rule of Park Chung-hee, when it and the surrounding area served as his political base. Daegu champions conservative political ideas and movements today and is a political base for the Saenuri Party.\nIn the 1980s, Daegu separated from Gyeongsangbuk-do and became a separately administered provincial-level directly governed city (Jikhalsi), and was redesignated as a metropolitan city (Gwangyeoksi) in 1995. Today, Daegu is the third-largest metropolitan area in Korea with respect to both population and commerce.\nIn February 2020, Daegu became known for the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nTwo local governments are in the city, the Daegu Metropolitan Government in Jung District and Gyeongbuk Provincial Government in Buk District. The provincial government will be relocated to Andong in its proper province, Gyeongbuk. The mayor and heads of city's eight districts are directly elected by the citizens every four years. The city council has 29 members which consist of 26 from the same number of electoral districts and three proportional representations. They are also directly elected every four years. Most of them are the members of the Liberty Korea Party, the main conservative political party in South Korea. Daegu is a stronghold for the party and has produced two Presidents of the Republic of Korea thus far: Roh Tae-woo and Park Geun-hye. As the capital of the Korean conservatives, the city has wielded strong political influence in elections.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nDaegu is divided into 7 districts (Gu) and 1 county (Gun)\n\nJung District (\uc911\uad6c, \u4e2d\u5340) \u2013 means the central district.\nDong District (\ub3d9\uad6c, \u6771\u5340) \u2013 means the east district.\nSeo District (\uc11c\uad6c, \u897f\u5340) \u2013 means the west district.\nNam District (\ub0a8\uad6c, \u5357\u5340) \u2013 means the south district.\nBuk District (\ubd81\uad6c, \u5317\u5340) \u2013 means the north district.\nSuseong District (\uc218\uc131\uad6c, \u58fd\u57ce\u5340)\nDalseo District (\ub2ec\uc11c\uad6c, \u9054\u897f\u5340)\nDalseong County (\ub2ec\uc131\uad70, \u9054\u57ce\u90e1)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nDaegu sits in a basin surrounded by low mountains. Palgongsan to the north, Biseulsan to the south, Waryongsan to the west, and a series of smaller hills in the east. The Geumho River flows along the northern and eastern edges of the city, emptying in the Nakdong River west of the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDaegu has a cooler version of a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa). In Holdridge climate classification, Daegu has a warm temperate moist forest climate. The mountains that comprise the basin trap hot and humid air. Similarly, in winter, cold air lies in the basin. The area receives little precipitation except during the rainy season of summer, and is sunny throughout much of the year. Data gathered since 1961 indicates that the mean temperature for January, the coldest month in Daegu, is 0.6 \u00b0C (33 \u00b0F) and that for August, the warmest month, is 26.4 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F). The City's lowest record temperature was \u221220.2 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F), and the City's highest record temperature was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F). The 40 degrees Celsius recorded in 1942 is also the highest temperature record in South Korea since the observation. This summer temperature has led to the emergence of a new term called Dae-Prika (Daegu+Africa) starting with the Internet community, and has recently been used in the media, broadcasting, etc. \n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nDaegu is a manufacturing industry city. The major industries are textiles, metals and machinery. In the year 2010, Daegu had a regional GDP of $45,387 million with 7.2% real GDP growth rate. The GDP per capita though is well below Korea national average. Many companies such as Daegu Bank, Korea Delphi, Hwasung corp., and TaeguTec are situated in this city, and Samsung and Kolon were founded here. Numerous factories are located in the industrial complexes situated in the west and north sides of the city including the Seongseo Industrial Complex, West Daegu Industrial Complex and the Daegu Dyeing Industrial Complex.\nThe city is the economic and industrial core of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk region, one of the major industrial areas in Korea. It accounted for as much as 94 percent of Korea's trade surplus in 2006. The electronics industries in Gumi and the steel industries in Pohang provided great services to that surplus. World-leading manufacturing facilities for Anycall (Samsung Mobile) and POSCO's main factories are located near the city. Daegu and its neighbouring cities were designated for the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone by the central government in 2008. It is specialized companies like Winitech software company in knowledge-based service and manufacturing industries.\nHistorically, Daegu has been the commercial center of the southern part of the Korean Peninsula with Seoul in the center and Pyongyang in the north (currently North Korea), because of its advantageous location. Some of the large, traditional markets like Seomun Market are still flourishing in the city.\nAdditionally, Daegu was considered the third major economic city in Korea, after Seoul and Busan. However, due to the decline of the textile industry, which is the heart of Daegu's economy, the overall economic growth of the city has also fallen.\nAlso, the city is the warmest region in South Korea due to the humid subtropical climate. This climate condition provides the region with high quality apples and oriental melons. The fruit industry is a crucial support for the local economy. Due to the stagnant economy, Daegu's population began to decrease after 2003. Recently, the local government has begun focusing on working towards economic revival and concentrating on improving the city's fashion industry.\n\n\n=== Fashion industry ===\nBeginning in the late 1990s, Daegu has been actively making efforts to promote its fashion industry based on its textile and clothing manufacturing industries under the 'Daegu: Fashion City'. The city opens many exhibitions related to the fashion and textile industries including the Daegu Fashion Fair and Preview in Daegu annually or semi-annually, and invites national institutes. A large new town specializing in the textile-fashion industries is currently under construction in Bongmu-dong, northeastern Daegu. The district, officially named Esiapolis, takes aim at the fashion hub of East Asia. Textile complexes, textile-fashion institutions, an international school, fashion malls as well as residential areas plan to be developed in the district.\n\n\n== Culture and sightseeing ==\n\nGenerally Daegu is known as a conservative city. As well as being the largest inland city in the country beside Seoul it has become one of the major metropolitan areas in the nation. Traditionally, Buddhism has been strong; today there are still many temples. Confucianism is also popular in Daegu, with a large academy based in the city. Neon cross-topped spires of Christian churches can also be seen in the city.\n\n\n=== Sights ===\nThe most well-known sight of the city is the stone Buddha called Gatbawi on the top of Gwanbong, Palgongsan. It is famous for its stone gat (Korean traditional hat). People from all over the country visit the place, because they believe that the Buddha will grant one's single desire. Administratively, the site itself is located in the neighboring city, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk.\n\nOn the outskirts of the city, mountains keep many traditional temples such as Donghwasa, Pagyesa, and Buinsa. Donghwasa is a Buddhist temple that was built by Priest Geukdal-hwasang in 493, and many artifacts of the period are found around the temple. The International Tourist Zen Meditation Center is Korea's only Zen-themed center. Some lecture halls or memorial halls such as Dodong-seowon (\ub3c4\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9053\u6771\u66f8\u9662) and Nokdong-seowon (\ub179\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9e7f\u6d1e\u66f8\u9662) are also located in the suburbs.\nOld villages have been preserved, such as the Otgol village (Gyeongju Choi clan's original residence area) and the Inheung village (Nampyeong Mun's). In the urban area, the Joseon Dynasty's administrative or educational buildings including Gyeongsang-gamyeong (\uacbd\uc0c1\uac10\uc601, \u6176\u5c19\u76e3\u71df) and Daegu-hyanggyo (\ub300\uad6c\ud5a5\uad50, \u5927\u90b1\u9115\u6821) also remain. The main gateway of the city in that period called Yeongnam-jeilmun (\uc601\ub0a8\uc81c\uc77c\ubb38, \u5dba\u5357\u7b2c\u4e00\u9580, meaning the first gateway in Yeongnam), has been restored in Mangudang Park. Western style modern architecture like Gyesan Cathedral and the old building of Jeil Church are preserved across the urban area. Gyesan Cathedral is the third oldest gothic church building in Korea and the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Daegu which is one of three archdioceses in South Korea. Several buildings, in the present Keisung Academy and the KNU middle/high school, are famous too.\nYangnyeongsi (\uc57d\ub839\uc2dc, \u85e5\u4ee4\u5e02) in Namseongno (often called Yakjeon-golmok) is the oldest market for Korean medicinal herbs in the country with a history of 350 years. Bongsan-dong which has some art galleries and studios is being developed as the artistic center of the city since the 1990s.\nNearby tourist attractions include Haeinsa\u2014a Buddhist temple that houses the Tripitaka Koreana (a woodblock edition of the Tripitaka and one of the world's oldest extant complete collections of the Buddhist scriptures). Haeinsa is located in Gayasan National Park of Hapcheon, Gyeongnam. The historic city of Gyeongju, Gyeongbuk, the capital of the ancient kingdom of Silla is located east of Daegu.\n\n\n=== Mountains and parks ===\n\nMt. Palgong, Mt. Biseul, and Mt. Ap are the representative mountains in Daegu. Apsan, just in the southern part of the city, is the closest mountain from the urban area among them. It has many trails, Buddhist temples, a Korean War museum, and a gondola ride to the peak. Additionally, Waryongsan, Hamjisan, and Yongjibong are located in the city. These serve as neighborhood parks to the citizens. Mt. Palgong has a cable car to the summit. There are also hiking trails in the direction of the Donghwasa Temple and Sutaegol Valley.\nIn the urban area, several small mountains and hills play the same role. Dalseong Park, which sits inside a 1,500-year-old earth fortress, is a historic place of the city. It contains the city's only zoo and some monuments as well as the wall. Duryu Park or Duryusan is a large forest in the middle of the urban area. It has Daegu Tower, Woobang Land, Kolon Bandstand, Duryu Stadium, and many sports facilities.

Woobang Land is the largest amusement park out of the capital area. Many small gardens lie in the heart of the city, such as the National Debt Repayment Movement Memorial Park (Gukchae Bosang Park) and 2\u00b728 Park. The former park includes Dalgubeol-daejong (\ub2ec\uad6c\ubc8c\ub300\uc885, \u9054\u53e5\u4f10\u5927\u9418), which means the Dalgubeol grand bell. The bell is struck every week and year.

It has the Jung-angno subway station as the nearest station from its heart. Like its name meaning the street in the east fortress, the eastern part of Daegu-eupseong (\ub300\uad6c\uc74d\uc131, \u5927\u90b1\u9091\u57ce, means the Daegu-Principality Fortress) was situated along this street. The fortress, however, had been demolished in the early 20th century. Although Daegu is the nation's third or fourth largest city, the Dongseongno area form the largest and the broadest downtown area in the whole country except the capital city, Seoul.  In most cases, famous brands open their branch shop first here out of the Greater Seoul area.\n\nSub-downtowns in the city have its own commercial powers and colors.

Many of these belong to national or multinational chains, but the local Daegu Department Store also operates two branches, while another local chain, Donga Department Store operates four in the city proper. The six department stores among them gather at the downtown. The traditional markets such as Seomun Market and Chilseong Market sell all sorts of goods.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nMany traditional ceremonies and festivals in agrarian society disappeared in the process of modernization. A Confucian ritual ceremony called Seokjeondaeje is held at Daegu-hyanggyo every spring and autumn.

        "wiki": "Daegu (Korean: [t\u025b\u0261u]; \ub300\uad6c, \u5927\u90b1, literally 'large hill'\ub300\uad6c\uad11\uc5ed\uc2dc), formerly spelled Taegu and officially known as the Daegu Metropolitan City, is a city in South Korea, the fourth-largest after Seoul, Busan, and Incheon and the third-largest metropolitan area in the nation with over 2.5 million residents. Also, it is the second largest city in the Yeongnam region after Busan. However, it is the fourth city in terms of population after Seoul, Busan and Incheon. It was overtaken by Incheon in the 2000s, but still it is said to be the third city according to the \"Act on the Establishment of Daegu City and Incheon City\" (Act No. 3424 and April 13, 1981). Daegu and surrounding North Gyeongsang Province are often referred to as Daegu-Gyeongbuk, with a total population over 5 million. \nDaegu is located in south-eastern Korea about 80 km (50 mi) from the seacoast, near the Geumho River and its mainstream, Nakdong River in Gyeongsang-do. The Daegu basin is the central plain of the Yeongnam region. In ancient times, the Daegu area was part of the proto-kingdom Jinhan. Subsequently, Daegu came under the control of the Silla Kingdom, which unified the Korean Peninsula. During the Joseon Dynasty period, the city was the capital of Gyeongsang-do, one of the traditional eight provinces of the country.\nDaegu was an economic motor of Korea during the 1960s\u20131980s period and was especially known for its electronics industry. The humid subtropical climate of Daegu is ideal for producing high-quality apples, thus the nickname, \"Apple City\". Daegu is also known as \"Textile City\". Textiles used to be the pillar industry of the city. With the establishment of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone, Daegu is currently focusing on fostering fashion and high-tech industries.\nDaegu was the host city of the 22nd World Energy Congress, the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, and the 2003 Summer Universiade. It also hosted four matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory and early history ===\nArchaeological investigations in the Greater Daegu area have revealed a large number of settlements and burials of the prehistoric Mumun Pottery Period (around 1500\u2013300 BC). In fact, some of the earliest evidence of Mumun settlement in Gyeongsangdo have been excavated from Siji-dong and Seobyeon-dong. Dongcheon-dong is one of the substantial Mumun agricultural villages that have been excavated. The Dongcheon-dong site dates back to the Middle Mumun (around 850\u2013550 BC) and contains the remains of many prehistoric pit-houses and agricultural fields. Megalithic burials (dolmens) have also been found in large numbers in Daegu.\nAncient historical texts indicate that during the Proto\u2013Three Kingdoms (Mahan, Jinhan, and Byeonhan) period, Daegu was the site of a chiefdom or walled-town polity known from that time, according to historical records, as Dalgubeol. It was absorbed into the kingdom of Silla no later than the fifth century. The vestiges of the wall can be seen, and relics have been excavated in the current Dalseong Park.\n\n\n=== Silla ===\nSilla succeeded in unifying the Korean peninsula by defeating the other kingdoms of Baekje and Koguryo in the late seventh century, partly due to assistance from China's Tang Dynasty. Shortly thereafter, in 689, Silla's King Sinmun considered moving the capital from Gyeongju to Daegu, but was unable to do so.  This initiative is known only through a single line in the Samguk Sagi, a most valued historical record of ancient Korea by Koryeo Dynasty historian Kim Bu-sik, but it is presumed to indicate both an attempt by the Silla king to reinforce royal authority and the entrenched resistance of the Gyeongju political elites that was the likely cause of the move's failure. The city was given its current name in 757.\nIn the late 1990s, archaeologists excavated a large-scale fortified Silla site in Dongcheon-dong, Buk-gu. The site at Locality 2 consists of the remains of 39 raised-floor buildings enclosed by a formidable ditch-and-palisade system. The excavators hypothesize that the fortified site was a permanent military encampment or barracks. Archaeologists also uncovered a large Silla village dating to the sixth to seventh centuries AD at Siji-dong.\n\n\n=== Later Three Kingdoms and Goryeo ===\nDuring the Later Three Kingdoms period, 892\u2013936, Daegu was initially aligned with Hubaekje. In 927, northern Daegu was the site of the Battle of Gong Mountain between the forces of Goryeo under Wang Geon and those of Hubaekje under Gyeon Hwon. In this battle, the forces of Goryeo were crushed and Wang Geon himself was saved only by the heroic deed of his general Shin Sung-gyeom. However,  the atrocities of the Hubaekje forces at this time apparently changed local sympathizers to favor Wang Geon, who later became the king of Goryeo.\nNumerous place names and local legends in the area still bear witness to the historic battle of 927. Among these are \"Ansim\", which literally means \"peace of mind\", said to be the first place where Wang Geon dared to stop after escaping the battle, and \"Banwol\", or half-moon, where he is said to have stopped and admired the moon before returning to Goryeo. A statue commemorating the battle now stands in northern Daegu, as does a memorial to Sin Sunggyeom.\nIn the Goryeo period, the first edition of the Tripitaka Koreana was stored in Daegu, at the temple of Buinsa.  However, this edition was destroyed when the temple was sacked in 1254, during the Mongol invasions of Korea.\n\n\n=== Joseon ===\n\nDaegu served as an important transportation center during the Joseon Dynasty. She stands in the mid part of the Great Yeongnam Road which ran between Seoul and Busan. It lay at the junction of this arterial road and the roads to Gyeongju and Jinju.\nIn 1601, Daegu became the administrative capital of the Gyeongsang-do, which is current Daegu, Busan, Ulsan, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and Gyeongsangnam-do. At about that time, the city began to grow into a major city. The status continued for nearly 300 years, and the city has been transformed as the capital of Gyeongsangbuk-do since Gyeongsang-do was divided into two provinces, Gyeongsangbuk-do (northern Gyeongsang-province) and Gyeongsangnam-do (southern one) in 1896.\nDaegu's first regular markets were established during the late Joseon period. The most famous of these is the Yangnyeongsi herbal medicine market. This became a center of herbal trade in Joseon, and even attracted buyers from neighboring countries. Traders from Japan, who were not permitted to leave the Nakdong River valley, hired messengers to visit the market on their behalf. Seomun Market, which stood at the city's west gate at that time, was one of the top-three markets in the Joseon period.\n\n\n=== Korean Empire and colonial rule ===\nThe Korean hermit kingdom finally opened itself to the outside world in the late 19th century. In 1895, Daegu became the site of one of the country's first modern post offices, as a part of the 'Gab-o' reforms introduced in the aftermath of the Sino-Japanese war.Beginning in the late 1890s, increasing numbers of foreign merchants and workers started to visit Daegu, which emerged as a modern transportation center of the newly constructed Gyeongbu Line main railroad connecting Seoul and Busan.\nIn 1905, the old fortress wall was forcibly destroyed. The wall still survives only in the street names such as the streets Dongseongno and Bukseongno, \"east fortress street\" and \"north fortress street\", which now run where the wall once stood.\nIndependence movements against imperial aggressions were outstanding in Daegu. These began as early as 1898, when a branch of the Independence Club was opened in the town.  As the demise of the Korean Empire approached in 1907, local citizens led by Seo Sang-don organized the National Debt Repayment Movement. The movement spread nationwide, although it fell short of repaying the national debt through individual donations. Freedom fighting continued after the 1910 annexation, notably during the March 1st movement of 1919. At that time, four major demonstrations took place in Daegu, involving an estimated 23,000 peace-loving citizens.\n\n\n=== After 1945 ===\nIn 1946, the Daegu October Incident took place, one of the most serious social disorders since the foundation of the Republic of Korea. An operation by the Korean national police to take control of rioters on October 1 resulted in the death of three student demonstrators and injuries to many others, sparking a massive counter-attack, killing as many as 38 policemen. It was also the site of major demonstrations on February 28, 1960, prior to the presidential election of that year.Daegu and all of North Gyeongsang province had heavy guerrilla activities in the late 1940s, as thousands of refugees shied away from the fighting in Jeolla province and sought shelters in Daegu.  In November 1948, a unit in Daegu joined the mutiny which had begun in Yeosu the previous month.During the Korean War, heavy fighting occurred nearby along the Nakdong River. Daegu sat inside the Pusan Perimeter, however, so remained in South Korean hands throughout the war. As in many other areas during the Korean War, political killings of dissenters were widespread. A large series of engagements was fought around the city to prevent North Korean troops from crossing the Nakdong, the Battle of Taegu.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the city underwent explosive growth, and the population has increased more than tenfold since the end of the Korean War. The city was politically favored during the 18-year-long rule of Park Chung-hee, when it and the surrounding area served as his political base. Daegu champions conservative political ideas and movements today and is a political base for the Saenuri Party.\nIn the 1980s, Daegu separated from Gyeongsangbuk-do and became a separately administered provincial-level directly governed city (Jikhalsi), and was redesignated as a metropolitan city (Gwangyeoksi) in 1995. Today, Daegu is the third-largest metropolitan area in Korea with respect to both population and commerce.\nIn February 2020, Daegu became known for the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nTwo local governments are in the city, the Daegu Metropolitan Government in Jung District and Gyeongbuk Provincial Government in Buk District. The provincial government will be relocated to Andong in its proper province, Gyeongbuk. The mayor and heads of city's eight districts are directly elected by the citizens every four years. The city council has 29 members which consist of 26 from the same number of electoral districts and three proportional representations. They are also directly elected every four years. Most of them are the members of the Liberty Korea Party, the main conservative political party in South Korea. Daegu is a stronghold for the party and has produced two Presidents of the Republic of Korea thus far: Roh Tae-woo and Park Geun-hye. As the capital of the Korean conservatives, the city has wielded strong political influence in elections.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nDaegu is divided into 7 districts (Gu) and 1 county (Gun)\n\nJung District (\uc911\uad6c, \u4e2d\u5340) \u2013 means the central district.\nDong District (\ub3d9\uad6c, \u6771\u5340) \u2013 means the east district.\nSeo District (\uc11c\uad6c, \u897f\u5340) \u2013 means the west district.\nNam District (\ub0a8\uad6c, \u5357\u5340) \u2013 means the south district.\nBuk District (\ubd81\uad6c, \u5317\u5340) \u2013 means the north district.\nSuseong District (\uc218\uc131\uad6c, \u58fd\u57ce\u5340)\nDalseo District (\ub2ec\uc11c\uad6c, \u9054\u897f\u5340)\nDalseong County (\ub2ec\uc131\uad70, \u9054\u57ce\u90e1)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nDaegu sits in a basin surrounded by low mountains. Palgongsan to the north, Biseulsan to the south, Waryongsan to the west, and a series of smaller hills in the east. The Geumho River flows along the northern and eastern edges of the city, emptying in the Nakdong River west of the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDaegu has a cooler version of a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa). In Holdridge climate classification, Daegu has a warm temperate moist forest climate. The mountains that comprise the basin trap hot and humid air. Similarly, in winter, cold air lies in the basin. The area receives little precipitation except during the rainy season of summer, and is sunny throughout much of the year. Data gathered since 1961 indicates that the mean temperature for January, the coldest month in Daegu, is 0.6 \u00b0C (33 \u00b0F) and that for August, the warmest month, is 26.4 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F). The City's lowest record temperature was \u221220.2 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F), and the City's highest record temperature was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F). The 40 degrees Celsius recorded in 1942 is also the highest temperature record in South Korea since the observation. This summer temperature has led to the emergence of a new term called Dae-Prika (Daegu+Africa) starting with the Internet community, and has recently been used in the media, broadcasting, etc. \n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nDaegu is a manufacturing industry city. The major industries are textiles, metals and machinery. In the year 2010, Daegu had a regional GDP of $45,387 million with 7.2% real GDP growth rate. The GDP per capita though is well below Korea national average. Many companies such as Daegu Bank, Korea Delphi, Hwasung corp., and TaeguTec are situated in this city, and Samsung and Kolon were founded here. Numerous factories are located in the industrial complexes situated in the west and north sides of the city including the Seongseo Industrial Complex, West Daegu Industrial Complex and the Daegu Dyeing Industrial Complex.\nThe city is the economic and industrial core of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk region, one of the major industrial areas in Korea. It accounted for as much as 94 percent of Korea's trade surplus in 2006. The electronics industries in Gumi and the steel industries in Pohang provided great services to that surplus. World-leading manufacturing facilities for Anycall (Samsung Mobile) and POSCO's main factories are located near the city. Daegu and its neighbouring cities were designated for the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone by the central government in 2008. It is specialized companies like Winitech software company in knowledge-based service and manufacturing industries.\nHistorically, Daegu has been the commercial center of the southern part of the Korean Peninsula with Seoul in the center and Pyongyang in the north (currently North Korea), because of its advantageous location. Some of the large, traditional markets like Seomun Market are still flourishing in the city.\nAdditionally, Daegu was considered the third major economic city in Korea, after Seoul and Busan. However, due to the decline of the textile industry, which is the heart of Daegu's economy, the overall economic growth of the city has also fallen.\nAlso, the city is the warmest region in South Korea due to the humid subtropical climate. This climate condition provides the region with high quality apples and oriental melons. The fruit industry is a crucial support for the local economy. Due to the stagnant economy, Daegu's population began to decrease after 2003. Recently, the local government has begun focusing on working towards economic revival and concentrating on improving the city's fashion industry.\n\n\n=== Fashion industry ===\nBeginning in the late 1990s, Daegu has been actively making efforts to promote its fashion industry based on its textile and clothing manufacturing industries under the 'Daegu: Fashion City'. The city opens many exhibitions related to the fashion and textile industries including the Daegu Fashion Fair and Preview in Daegu annually or semi-annually, and invites national institutes. A large new town specializing in the textile-fashion industries is currently under construction in Bongmu-dong, northeastern Daegu. The district, officially named Esiapolis, takes aim at the fashion hub of East Asia. Textile complexes, textile-fashion institutions, an international school, fashion malls as well as residential areas plan to be developed in the district.\n\n\n== Culture and sightseeing ==\n\nGenerally Daegu is known as a conservative city. As well as being the largest inland city in the country beside Seoul it has become one of the major metropolitan areas in the nation. Traditionally, Buddhism has been strong; today there are still many temples. Confucianism is also popular in Daegu, with a large academy based in the city. Neon cross-topped spires of Christian churches can also be seen in the city.\n\n\n=== Sights ===\nThe most well-known sight of the city is the stone Buddha called Gatbawi on the top of Gwanbong, Palgongsan. It is famous for its stone gat (Korean traditional hat). People from all over the country visit the place, because they believe that the Buddha will grant one's single desire. Administratively, the site itself is located in the neighboring city, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk.\n\nOn the outskirts of the city, mountains keep many traditional temples such as Donghwasa, Pagyesa, and Buinsa. Donghwasa is a Buddhist temple that was built by Priest Geukdal-hwasang in 493, and many artifacts of the period are found around the temple. The International Tourist Zen Meditation Center is Korea's only Zen-themed center. Some lecture halls or memorial halls such as Dodong-seowon (\ub3c4\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9053\u6771\u66f8\u9662) and Nokdong-seowon (\ub179\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9e7f\u6d1e\u66f8\u9662) are also located in the suburbs.\nOld villages have been preserved, such as the Otgol village (Gyeongju Choi clan's original residence area) and the Inheung village (Nampyeong Mun's). In the urban area, the Joseon Dynasty's administrative or educational buildings including Gyeongsang-gamyeong (\uacbd\uc0c1\uac10\uc601, \u6176\u5c19\u76e3\u71df) and Daegu-hyanggyo (\ub300\uad6c\ud5a5\uad50, \u5927\u90b1\u9115\u6821) also remain. The main gateway of the city in that period called Yeongnam-jeilmun (\uc601\ub0a8\uc81c\uc77c\ubb38, \u5dba\u5357\u7b2c\u4e00\u9580, meaning the first gateway in Yeongnam), has been restored in Mangudang Park. Western style modern architecture like Gyesan Cathedral and the old building of Jeil Church are preserved across the urban area. Gyesan Cathedral is the third oldest gothic church building in Korea and the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Daegu which is one of three archdioceses in South Korea. Several buildings, in the present Keisung Academy and the KNU middle/high school, are famous too.\nYangnyeongsi (\uc57d\ub839\uc2dc, \u85e5\u4ee4\u5e02) in Namseongno (often called Yakjeon-golmok) is the oldest market for Korean medicinal herbs in the country with a history of 350 years. Bongsan-dong which has some art galleries and studios is being developed as the artistic center of the city since the 1990s.\nNearby tourist attractions include Haeinsa\u2014a Buddhist temple that houses the Tripitaka Koreana (a woodblock edition of the Tripitaka and one of the world's oldest extant complete collections of the Buddhist scriptures). Haeinsa is located in Gayasan National Park of Hapcheon, Gyeongnam. The historic city of Gyeongju, Gyeongbuk, the capital of the ancient kingdom of Silla is located east of Daegu.\n\n\n=== Mountains and parks ===\n\nMt. Palgong, Mt. Biseul, and Mt. Ap are the representative mountains in Daegu. Apsan, just in the southern part of the city, is the closest mountain from the urban area among them. It has many trails, Buddhist temples, a Korean War museum, and a gondola ride to the peak. Additionally, Waryongsan, Hamjisan, and Yongjibong are located in the city. These serve as neighborhood parks to the citizens. Mt. Palgong has a cable car to the summit. There are also hiking trails in the direction of the Donghwasa Temple and Sutaegol Valley.\nIn the urban area, several small mountains and hills play the same role. Dalseong Park, which sits inside a 1,500-year-old earth fortress, is a historic place of the city. It contains the city's only zoo and some monuments as well as the wall. Duryu Park or Duryusan is a large forest in the middle of the urban area. It has Daegu Tower, Woobang Land, Kolon Bandstand, Duryu Stadium, and many sports facilities. Daegu Tower, also called Woobang Tower or Duryu Tower, is the tallest contemporary structure (202 m) and a symbol of the city. Its observatory commands good views of the surroundings. Woobang Land is the largest amusement park out of the capital area. Many small gardens lie in the heart of the city, such as the National Debt Repayment Movement Memorial Park (Gukchae Bosang Park) and 2\u00b728 Park. The former park includes Dalgubeol-daejong (\ub2ec\uad6c\ubc8c\ub300\uc885, \u9054\u53e5\u4f10\u5927\u9418), which means the Dalgubeol grand bell. The bell is struck every week and year. There is also a botanical garden with a variety of plants and flowers.\n\n\n=== Downtown and shopping ===\nDongseongno (\ub3d9\uc131\ub85c, \u6771\u57ce\u8def) is the downtown of Daegu lying from the Daegu Station to Jung-ang pachulso (central police station) near the Banwoldang subway station in the center of the city Jung-gu. It has the Jung-angno subway station as the nearest station from its heart. Like its name meaning the street in the east fortress, the eastern part of Daegu-eupseong (\ub300\uad6c\uc74d\uc131, \u5927\u90b1\u9091\u57ce, means the Daegu-Principality Fortress) was situated along this street. The fortress, however, had been demolished in the early 20th century. Although Daegu is the nation's third or fourth largest city, the Dongseongno area form the largest and the broadest downtown area in the whole country except the capital city, Seoul.  In most cases, famous brands open their branch shop first here out of the Greater Seoul area.\n\nSub-downtowns in the city have its own commercial powers and colors. The area around the Seongseo Industrial Complex subway station in Dalseo-gu is a concentration of many amusement spots, and young people easily can be seen around Kyungpook National University in Buk-gu. Deuran-gil (means the street inside the field) in Suseong-gu is known for many restaurants.\nThe city has a number of department stores. Many of these belong to national or multinational chains, but the local Daegu Department Store also operates two branches, while another local chain, Donga Department Store operates four in the city proper. The six department stores among them gather at the downtown. The traditional markets such as Seomun Market and Chilseong Market sell all sorts of goods.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nMany traditional ceremonies and festivals in agrarian society disappeared in the process of modernization. A Confucian ritual ceremony called Seokjeondaeje is held at Daegu-hyanggyo every spring and autumn. The Yangnyeongsi herb medical festival and Otgol village festival are the contemporary festivals about traditional culture.\nLately in the city, enthusiasm about performing arts is growing and the local government is trying to meet its demand. Daegu International Opera Festival (DIOF) in October since 2003, Daegu International Musical Festival (DIMF), and Daegu International Bodypainting Festival (DIBF) are three of the most famous festivals on each field in Korea, although those have short histories.\nVarious festivals in various themes like the Colorful Daegu Festival, Dongseongno festival, Palgongsan maple festival, Biseulsan azalea festival, Korea in Motion Daegu, and so on, are held by the city, each ward, or the specific groups, all through the year.\nOn August 25 through August 31, 2008, Daegu hosted the first ever Asian Bodypainting Festival, a sister event of the World Bodypainting Festival in Seeboden, Austria.\nEach year the city is home to the Daegu International Jazz Festival: http://www.dijf.or.kr/\nEvery May the \"Colorful Daegu Festival\" offers performances and art programs including the Colorful Parade. In July, the Daegu Chimac Festival takes place at Duryu Park in Dalseo-gu, Daegu. The term \"chimac\" is a portmanteau of chicken and maekju (meaning \"beer\"). There were over 880,000 visitors in 2015, and one million visitors during the festival in 2016.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nDaegu Art Museum\nDaegu National Museum \u2013 A notable national museum collecting relics excavated in and around Daegu\nDaegu Bangjja Yugi (Korean Bronzeware) Museum\nHengso Museum of Keimyung University\nKorea Video Museum\nKyungpook National University Museum\nMuseum for Daegu National University of Education\nMuseum of Natural Dye Arts\n\n\n=== Theaters ===\nDaegu Opera House \u2013 The first theater in Korea only for performing opera\nSuseong Artpia\nKeimyung Art Center \u2013 One of the largest scale theaters in the city.\nDaegu Culture and Arts Center\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nOn March 27, 2007, the city was selected to host the 2011 World Championships in Athletics. Daegu competed with cities such as Moscow, Russia and Brisbane, Australia to earn the votes of the IAAF Council. The event was the fourth IAAF World Championships in Athletics to be held outside Europe, and the first games in mainland Asia. It was also the third worldwide sports event held in Korea after the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul and 2002 FIFA World Cup in Korea and Japan. Daegu also hosted three matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, and the 2003 Summer Universiade. The city hosts the Colorful Daegu Pre-Championships Meeting every year since 2005.\n\nDaegu Stadium is the second largest sports complex in South Korea with a seating capacity of 66,422. Daegu Civic Stadium hosted some football matches at the 1988 Summer Olympics.\nThe Daegu Marathon is held here every year in April. The race begins and ends at the Daegu Stadium.\n\n\n==== Sports teams ====\n\n\n===== The Samsung Lions =====\nThe Samsung Lions (Hangul: \uc0bc\uc131 \ub77c\uc774\uc628\uc988) are a South Korean professional baseball team founded in 1982.

        "wiki": "Daegu (Korean: [t\u025b\u0261u]; \ub300\uad6c, \u5927\u90b1, literally 'large hill'\ub300\uad6c\uad11\uc5ed\uc2dc), formerly spelled Taegu and officially known as the Daegu Metropolitan City, is a city in South Korea, the fourth-largest after Seoul, Busan, and Incheon and the third-largest metropolitan area in the nation with over 2.5 million residents. Also, it is the second largest city in the Yeongnam region after Busan. However, it is the fourth city in terms of population after Seoul, Busan and Incheon. It was overtaken by Incheon in the 2000s, but still it is said to be the third city according to the \"Act on the Establishment of Daegu City and Incheon City\" (Act No. 3424 and April 13, 1981). Daegu and surrounding North Gyeongsang Province are often referred to as Daegu-Gyeongbuk, with a total population over 5 million. \nDaegu is located in south-eastern Korea about 80 km (50 mi) from the seacoast, near the Geumho River and its mainstream, Nakdong River in Gyeongsang-do. The Daegu basin is the central plain of the Yeongnam region. In ancient times, the Daegu area was part of the proto-kingdom Jinhan. Subsequently, Daegu came under the control of the Silla Kingdom, which unified the Korean Peninsula. During the Joseon Dynasty period, the city was the capital of Gyeongsang-do, one of the traditional eight provinces of the country.\nDaegu was an economic motor of Korea during the 1960s\u20131980s period and was especially known for its electronics industry. The humid subtropical climate of Daegu is ideal for producing high-quality apples, thus the nickname, \"Apple City\". Daegu is also known as \"Textile City\". Textiles used to be the pillar industry of the city. With the establishment of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone, Daegu is currently focusing on fostering fashion and high-tech industries.\nDaegu was the host city of the 22nd World Energy Congress, the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, and the 2003 Summer Universiade. It also hosted four matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory and early history ===\nArchaeological investigations in the Greater Daegu area have revealed a large number of settlements and burials of the prehistoric Mumun Pottery Period (around 1500\u2013300 BC). In fact, some of the earliest evidence of Mumun settlement in Gyeongsangdo have been excavated from Siji-dong and Seobyeon-dong. Dongcheon-dong is one of the substantial Mumun agricultural villages that have been excavated. The Dongcheon-dong site dates back to the Middle Mumun (around 850\u2013550 BC) and contains the remains of many prehistoric pit-houses and agricultural fields. Megalithic burials (dolmens) have also been found in large numbers in Daegu.\nAncient historical texts indicate that during the Proto\u2013Three Kingdoms (Mahan, Jinhan, and Byeonhan) period, Daegu was the site of a chiefdom or walled-town polity known from that time, according to historical records, as Dalgubeol. It was absorbed into the kingdom of Silla no later than the fifth century. The vestiges of the wall can be seen, and relics have been excavated in the current Dalseong Park.\n\n\n=== Silla ===\nSilla succeeded in unifying the Korean peninsula by defeating the other kingdoms of Baekje and Koguryo in the late seventh century, partly due to assistance from China's Tang Dynasty. Shortly thereafter, in 689, Silla's King Sinmun considered moving the capital from Gyeongju to Daegu, but was unable to do so.  This initiative is known only through a single line in the Samguk Sagi, a most valued historical record of ancient Korea by Koryeo Dynasty historian Kim Bu-sik, but it is presumed to indicate both an attempt by the Silla king to reinforce royal authority and the entrenched resistance of the Gyeongju political elites that was the likely cause of the move's failure. The city was given its current name in 757.\nIn the late 1990s, archaeologists excavated a large-scale fortified Silla site in Dongcheon-dong, Buk-gu. The site at Locality 2 consists of the remains of 39 raised-floor buildings enclosed by a formidable ditch-and-palisade system. The excavators hypothesize that the fortified site was a permanent military encampment or barracks. Archaeologists also uncovered a large Silla village dating to the sixth to seventh centuries AD at Siji-dong.\n\n\n=== Later Three Kingdoms and Goryeo ===\nDuring the Later Three Kingdoms period, 892\u2013936, Daegu was initially aligned with Hubaekje. In 927, northern Daegu was the site of the Battle of Gong Mountain between the forces of Goryeo under Wang Geon and those of Hubaekje under Gyeon Hwon. In this battle, the forces of Goryeo were crushed and Wang Geon himself was saved only by the heroic deed of his general Shin Sung-gyeom. However,  the atrocities of the Hubaekje forces at this time apparently changed local sympathizers to favor Wang Geon, who later became the king of Goryeo.\nNumerous place names and local legends in the area still bear witness to the historic battle of 927. Among these are \"Ansim\", which literally means \"peace of mind\", said to be the first place where Wang Geon dared to stop after escaping the battle, and \"Banwol\", or half-moon, where he is said to have stopped and admired the moon before returning to Goryeo. A statue commemorating the battle now stands in northern Daegu, as does a memorial to Sin Sunggyeom.\nIn the Goryeo period, the first edition of the Tripitaka Koreana was stored in Daegu, at the temple of Buinsa.  However, this edition was destroyed when the temple was sacked in 1254, during the Mongol invasions of Korea.\n\n\n=== Joseon ===\n\nDaegu served as an important transportation center during the Joseon Dynasty. She stands in the mid part of the Great Yeongnam Road which ran between Seoul and Busan. It lay at the junction of this arterial road and the roads to Gyeongju and Jinju.\nIn 1601, Daegu became the administrative capital of the Gyeongsang-do, which is current Daegu, Busan, Ulsan, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and Gyeongsangnam-do. At about that time, the city began to grow into a major city. The status continued for nearly 300 years, and the city has been transformed as the capital of Gyeongsangbuk-do since Gyeongsang-do was divided into two provinces, Gyeongsangbuk-do (northern Gyeongsang-province) and Gyeongsangnam-do (southern one) in 1896.\nDaegu's first regular markets were established during the late Joseon period. The most famous of these is the Yangnyeongsi herbal medicine market. This became a center of herbal trade in Joseon, and even attracted buyers from neighboring countries. Traders from Japan, who were not permitted to leave the Nakdong River valley, hired messengers to visit the market on their behalf. Seomun Market, which stood at the city's west gate at that time, was one of the top-three markets in the Joseon period.\n\n\n=== Korean Empire and colonial rule ===\nThe Korean hermit kingdom finally opened itself to the outside world in the late 19th century. In 1895, Daegu became the site of one of the country's first modern post offices, as a part of the 'Gab-o' reforms introduced in the aftermath of the Sino-Japanese war.Beginning in the late 1890s, increasing numbers of foreign merchants and workers started to visit Daegu, which emerged as a modern transportation center of the newly constructed Gyeongbu Line main railroad connecting Seoul and Busan.\nIn 1905, the old fortress wall was forcibly destroyed. The wall still survives only in the street names such as the streets Dongseongno and Bukseongno, \"east fortress street\" and \"north fortress street\", which now run where the wall once stood.\nIndependence movements against imperial aggressions were outstanding in Daegu. These began as early as 1898, when a branch of the Independence Club was opened in the town.  As the demise of the Korean Empire approached in 1907, local citizens led by Seo Sang-don organized the National Debt Repayment Movement. The movement spread nationwide, although it fell short of repaying the national debt through individual donations. Freedom fighting continued after the 1910 annexation, notably during the March 1st movement of 1919. At that time, four major demonstrations took place in Daegu, involving an estimated 23,000 peace-loving citizens.\n\n\n=== After 1945 ===\nIn 1946, the Daegu October Incident took place, one of the most serious social disorders since the foundation of the Republic of Korea. An operation by the Korean national police to take control of rioters on October 1 resulted in the death of three student demonstrators and injuries to many others, sparking a massive counter-attack, killing as many as 38 policemen. It was also the site of major demonstrations on February 28, 1960, prior to the presidential election of that year.Daegu and all of North Gyeongsang province had heavy guerrilla activities in the late 1940s, as thousands of refugees shied away from the fighting in Jeolla province and sought shelters in Daegu.  In November 1948, a unit in Daegu joined the mutiny which had begun in Yeosu the previous month.During the Korean War, heavy fighting occurred nearby along the Nakdong River. Daegu sat inside the Pusan Perimeter, however, so remained in South Korean hands throughout the war. As in many other areas during the Korean War, political killings of dissenters were widespread. A large series of engagements was fought around the city to prevent North Korean troops from crossing the Nakdong, the Battle of Taegu.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the city underwent explosive growth, and the population has increased more than tenfold since the end of the Korean War. The city was politically favored during the 18-year-long rule of Park Chung-hee, when it and the surrounding area served as his political base. Daegu champions conservative political ideas and movements today and is a political base for the Saenuri Party.\nIn the 1980s, Daegu separated from Gyeongsangbuk-do and became a separately administered provincial-level directly governed city (Jikhalsi), and was redesignated as a metropolitan city (Gwangyeoksi) in 1995. Today, Daegu is the third-largest metropolitan area in Korea with respect to both population and commerce.\nIn February 2020, Daegu became known for the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nTwo local governments are in the city, the Daegu Metropolitan Government in Jung District and Gyeongbuk Provincial Government in Buk District. The provincial government will be relocated to Andong in its proper province, Gyeongbuk. The mayor and heads of city's eight districts are directly elected by the citizens every four years. The city council has 29 members which consist of 26 from the same number of electoral districts and three proportional representations. They are also directly elected every four years. Most of them are the members of the Liberty Korea Party, the main conservative political party in South Korea. Daegu is a stronghold for the party and has produced two Presidents of the Republic of Korea thus far: Roh Tae-woo and Park Geun-hye. As the capital of the Korean conservatives, the city has wielded strong political influence in elections.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nDaegu is divided into 7 districts (Gu) and 1 county (Gun)\n\nJung District (\uc911\uad6c, \u4e2d\u5340) \u2013 means the central district.\nDong District (\ub3d9\uad6c, \u6771\u5340) \u2013 means the east district.\nSeo District (\uc11c\uad6c, \u897f\u5340) \u2013 means the west district.\nNam District (\ub0a8\uad6c, \u5357\u5340) \u2013 means the south district.\nBuk District (\ubd81\uad6c, \u5317\u5340) \u2013 means the north district.\nSuseong District (\uc218\uc131\uad6c, \u58fd\u57ce\u5340)\nDalseo District (\ub2ec\uc11c\uad6c, \u9054\u897f\u5340)\nDalseong County (\ub2ec\uc131\uad70, \u9054\u57ce\u90e1)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nDaegu sits in a basin surrounded by low mountains. Palgongsan to the north, Biseulsan to the south, Waryongsan to the west, and a series of smaller hills in the east. The Geumho River flows along the northern and eastern edges of the city, emptying in the Nakdong River west of the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDaegu has a cooler version of a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa). In Holdridge climate classification, Daegu has a warm temperate moist forest climate. The mountains that comprise the basin trap hot and humid air. Similarly, in winter, cold air lies in the basin. The area receives little precipitation except during the rainy season of summer, and is sunny throughout much of the year. Data gathered since 1961 indicates that the mean temperature for January, the coldest month in Daegu, is 0.6 \u00b0C (33 \u00b0F) and that for August, the warmest month, is 26.4 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F). The City's lowest record temperature was \u221220.2 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F), and the City's highest record temperature was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F). The 40 degrees Celsius recorded in 1942 is also the highest temperature record in South Korea since the observation. This summer temperature has led to the emergence of a new term called Dae-Prika (Daegu+Africa) starting with the Internet community, and has recently been used in the media, broadcasting, etc. \n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nDaegu is a manufacturing industry city. The major industries are textiles, metals and machinery. In the year 2010, Daegu had a regional GDP of $45,387 million with 7.2% real GDP growth rate. The GDP per capita though is well below Korea national average. Many companies such as Daegu Bank, Korea Delphi, Hwasung corp., and TaeguTec are situated in this city, and Samsung and Kolon were founded here. Numerous factories are located in the industrial complexes situated in the west and north sides of the city including the Seongseo Industrial Complex, West Daegu Industrial Complex and the Daegu Dyeing Industrial Complex.\nThe city is the economic and industrial core of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk region, one of the major industrial areas in Korea. It accounted for as much as 94 percent of Korea's trade surplus in 2006. The electronics industries in Gumi and the steel industries in Pohang provided great services to that surplus. World-leading manufacturing facilities for Anycall (Samsung Mobile) and POSCO's main factories are located near the city. Daegu and its neighbouring cities were designated for the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone by the central government in 2008. It is specialized companies like Winitech software company in knowledge-based service and manufacturing industries.\nHistorically, Daegu has been the commercial center of the southern part of the Korean Peninsula with Seoul in the center and Pyongyang in the north (currently North Korea), because of its advantageous location. Some of the large, traditional markets like Seomun Market are still flourishing in the city.\nAdditionally, Daegu was considered the third major economic city in Korea, after Seoul and Busan. However, due to the decline of the textile industry, which is the heart of Daegu's economy, the overall economic growth of the city has also fallen.\nAlso, the city is the warmest region in South Korea due to the humid subtropical climate. This climate condition provides the region with high quality apples and oriental melons. The fruit industry is a crucial support for the local economy. Due to the stagnant economy, Daegu's population began to decrease after 2003. Recently, the local government has begun focusing on working towards economic revival and concentrating on improving the city's fashion industry.\n\n\n=== Fashion industry ===\nBeginning in the late 1990s, Daegu has been actively making efforts to promote its fashion industry based on its textile and clothing manufacturing industries under the 'Daegu: Fashion City'. The city opens many exhibitions related to the fashion and textile industries including the Daegu Fashion Fair and Preview in Daegu annually or semi-annually, and invites national institutes. A large new town specializing in the textile-fashion industries is currently under construction in Bongmu-dong, northeastern Daegu. The district, officially named Esiapolis, takes aim at the fashion hub of East Asia. Textile complexes, textile-fashion institutions, an international school, fashion malls as well as residential areas plan to be developed in the district.\n\n\n== Culture and sightseeing ==\n\nGenerally Daegu is known as a conservative city. As well as being the largest inland city in the country beside Seoul it has become one of the major metropolitan areas in the nation. Traditionally, Buddhism has been strong; today there are still many temples. Confucianism is also popular in Daegu, with a large academy based in the city. Neon cross-topped spires of Christian churches can also be seen in the city.\n\n\n=== Sights ===\nThe most well-known sight of the city is the stone Buddha called Gatbawi on the top of Gwanbong, Palgongsan. It is famous for its stone gat (Korean traditional hat). People from all over the country visit the place, because they believe that the Buddha will grant one's single desire. Administratively, the site itself is located in the neighboring city, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk.\n\nOn the outskirts of the city, mountains keep many traditional temples such as Donghwasa, Pagyesa, and Buinsa. Donghwasa is a Buddhist temple that was built by Priest Geukdal-hwasang in 493, and many artifacts of the period are found around the temple. The International Tourist Zen Meditation Center is Korea's only Zen-themed center. Some lecture halls or memorial halls such as Dodong-seowon (\ub3c4\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9053\u6771\u66f8\u9662) and Nokdong-seowon (\ub179\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9e7f\u6d1e\u66f8\u9662) are also located in the suburbs.\nOld villages have been preserved, such as the Otgol village (Gyeongju Choi clan's original residence area) and the Inheung village (Nampyeong Mun's). In the urban area, the Joseon Dynasty's administrative or educational buildings including Gyeongsang-gamyeong (\uacbd\uc0c1\uac10\uc601, \u6176\u5c19\u76e3\u71df) and Daegu-hyanggyo (\ub300\uad6c\ud5a5\uad50, \u5927\u90b1\u9115\u6821) also remain. The main gateway of the city in that period called Yeongnam-jeilmun (\uc601\ub0a8\uc81c\uc77c\ubb38, \u5dba\u5357\u7b2c\u4e00\u9580, meaning the first gateway in Yeongnam), has been restored in Mangudang Park. Western style modern architecture like Gyesan Cathedral and the old building of Jeil Church are preserved across the urban area. Gyesan Cathedral is the third oldest gothic church building in Korea and the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Daegu which is one of three archdioceses in South Korea. Several buildings, in the present Keisung Academy and the KNU middle/high school, are famous too.\nYangnyeongsi (\uc57d\ub839\uc2dc, \u85e5\u4ee4\u5e02) in Namseongno (often called Yakjeon-golmok) is the oldest market for Korean medicinal herbs in the country with a history of 350 years. Bongsan-dong which has some art galleries and studios is being developed as the artistic center of the city since the 1990s.\nNearby tourist attractions include Haeinsa\u2014a Buddhist temple that houses the Tripitaka Koreana (a woodblock edition of the Tripitaka and one of the world's oldest extant complete collections of the Buddhist scriptures). Haeinsa is located in Gayasan National Park of Hapcheon, Gyeongnam. The historic city of Gyeongju, Gyeongbuk, the capital of the ancient kingdom of Silla is located east of Daegu.\n\n\n=== Mountains and parks ===\n\nMt. Palgong, Mt. Biseul, and Mt. Ap are the representative mountains in Daegu. Apsan, just in the southern part of the city, is the closest mountain from the urban area among them. It has many trails, Buddhist temples, a Korean War museum, and a gondola ride to the peak. Additionally, Waryongsan, Hamjisan, and Yongjibong are located in the city. These serve as neighborhood parks to the citizens. Mt. Palgong has a cable car to the summit. There are also hiking trails in the direction of the Donghwasa Temple and Sutaegol Valley.\nIn the urban area, several small mountains and hills play the same role. Dalseong Park, which sits inside a 1,500-year-old earth fortress, is a historic place of the city. It contains the city's only zoo and some monuments as well as the wall. Duryu Park or Duryusan is a large forest in the middle of the urban area. It has Daegu Tower, Woobang Land, Kolon Bandstand, Duryu Stadium, and many sports facilities. Daegu Tower, also called Woobang Tower or Duryu Tower, is the tallest contemporary structure (202 m) and a symbol of the city. Its observatory commands good views of the surroundings. Woobang Land is the largest amusement park out of the capital area. Many small gardens lie in the heart of the city, such as the National Debt Repayment Movement Memorial Park (Gukchae Bosang Park) and 2\u00b728 Park. The former park includes Dalgubeol-daejong (\ub2ec\uad6c\ubc8c\ub300\uc885, \u9054\u53e5\u4f10\u5927\u9418), which means the Dalgubeol grand bell. The bell is struck every week and year. There is also a botanical garden with a variety of plants and flowers.\n\n\n=== Downtown and shopping ===\nDongseongno (\ub3d9\uc131\ub85c, \u6771\u57ce\u8def) is the downtown of Daegu lying from the Daegu Station to Jung-ang pachulso (central police station) near the Banwoldang subway station in the center of the city Jung-gu. It has the Jung-angno subway station as the nearest station from its heart. Like its name meaning the street in the east fortress, the eastern part of Daegu-eupseong (\ub300\uad6c\uc74d\uc131, \u5927\u90b1\u9091\u57ce, means the Daegu-Principality Fortress) was situated along this street. The fortress, however, had been demolished in the early 20th century. Although Daegu is the nation's third or fourth largest city, the Dongseongno area form the largest and the broadest downtown area in the whole country except the capital city, Seoul.  In most cases, famous brands open their branch shop first here out of the Greater Seoul area.\n\nSub-downtowns in the city have its own commercial powers and colors. The area around the Seongseo Industrial Complex subway station in Dalseo-gu is a concentration of many amusement spots, and young people easily can be seen around Kyungpook National University in Buk-gu. Deuran-gil (means the street inside the field) in Suseong-gu is known for many restaurants.\nThe city has a number of department stores. Many of these belong to national or multinational chains, but the local Daegu Department Store also operates two branches, while another local chain, Donga Department Store operates four in the city proper. The six department stores among them gather at the downtown. The traditional markets such as Seomun Market and Chilseong Market sell all sorts of goods.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nMany traditional ceremonies and festivals in agrarian society disappeared in the process of modernization. A Confucian ritual ceremony called Seokjeondaeje is held at Daegu-hyanggyo every spring and autumn. The Yangnyeongsi herb medical festival and Otgol village festival are the contemporary festivals about traditional culture.\nLately in the city, enthusiasm about performing arts is growing and the local government is trying to meet its demand. Daegu International Opera Festival (DIOF) in October since 2003, Daegu International Musical Festival (DIMF), and Daegu International Bodypainting Festival (DIBF) are three of the most famous festivals on each field in Korea, although those have short histories.\nVarious festivals in various themes like the Colorful Daegu Festival, Dongseongno festival, Palgongsan maple festival, Biseulsan azalea festival, Korea in Motion Daegu, and so on, are held by the city, each ward, or the specific groups, all through the year.\nOn August 25 through August 31, 2008, Daegu hosted the first ever Asian Bodypainting Festival, a sister event of the World Bodypainting Festival in Seeboden, Austria.\nEach year the city is home to the Daegu International Jazz Festival: http://www.dijf.or.kr/\nEvery May the \"Colorful Daegu Festival\" offers performances and art programs including the Colorful Parade. In July, the Daegu Chimac Festival takes place at Duryu Park in Dalseo-gu, Daegu. The term \"chimac\" is a portmanteau of chicken and maekju (meaning \"beer\"). There were over 880,000 visitors in 2015, and one million visitors during the festival in 2016.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nDaegu Art Museum\nDaegu National Museum \u2013 A notable national museum collecting relics excavated in and around Daegu\nDaegu Bangjja Yugi (Korean Bronzeware) Museum\nHengso Museum of Keimyung University\nKorea Video Museum\nKyungpook National University Museum\nMuseum for Daegu National University of Education\nMuseum of Natural Dye Arts\n\n\n=== Theaters ===\nDaegu Opera House \u2013 The first theater in Korea only for performing opera\nSuseong Artpia\nKeimyung Art Center \u2013 One of the largest scale theaters in the city.\nDaegu Culture and Arts Center\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nOn March 27, 2007, the city was selected to host the 2011 World Championships in Athletics. Daegu competed with cities such as Moscow, Russia and Brisbane, Australia to earn the votes of the IAAF Council. The event was the fourth IAAF World Championships in Athletics to be held outside Europe, and the first games in mainland Asia. It was also the third worldwide sports event held in Korea after the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul and 2002 FIFA World Cup in Korea and Japan. Daegu also hosted three matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, and the 2003 Summer Universiade. The city hosts the Colorful Daegu Pre-Championships Meeting every year since 2005.\n\nDaegu Stadium is the second largest sports complex in South Korea with a seating capacity of 66,422.

They cover to Gyeongsangbuk-do out of the city. Each television broadcasting company has its own radio station as well.\n\n\n=== International Daegu ===\nDaegu is largely a homogeneous community that includes few non-Koreans. However, a number of immigrants from South and Southeast Asia work in automotive-parts factories on the city's west side. In addition, there is a small group of English-speaking Westerners working in English schools and university programs. The American military bases are also home to several hundred Americans. Recently Chinese students have begun studying Korean at universities in Daegu, and there is an increasing number of graduate and post-graduate students from other Asian countries. As elsewhere in Korea, Korean food overwhelmingly dominates; Chinese, Japanese and Western food forms the bulk of non-Korean food but recently Indian and Russian foods have become available.\nDaegu hosts three American military bases, Camp Henry, Camp George which houses Daegu American School, and Camp Walker. Camp Walker houses Daegu High School for high school children, while Camp George hold the school for elementary and middle school (both of which are primarily for children of military personnel and US Military civilian employees).

        "wiki": "Daegu (Korean: [t\u025b\u0261u]; \ub300\uad6c, \u5927\u90b1, literally 'large hill'\ub300\uad6c\uad11\uc5ed\uc2dc), formerly spelled Taegu and officially known as the Daegu Metropolitan City, is a city in South Korea, the fourth-largest after Seoul, Busan, and Incheon and the third-largest metropolitan area in the nation with over 2.5 million residents. Also, it is the second largest city in the Yeongnam region after Busan. However, it is the fourth city in terms of population after Seoul, Busan and Incheon. It was overtaken by Incheon in the 2000s, but still it is said to be the third city according to the \"Act on the Establishment of Daegu City and Incheon City\" (Act No. 3424 and April 13, 1981). Daegu and surrounding North Gyeongsang Province are often referred to as Daegu-Gyeongbuk, with a total population over 5 million. \nDaegu is located in south-eastern Korea about 80 km (50 mi) from the seacoast, near the Geumho River and its mainstream, Nakdong River in Gyeongsang-do. The Daegu basin is the central plain of the Yeongnam region. In ancient times, the Daegu area was part of the proto-kingdom Jinhan. Subsequently, Daegu came under the control of the Silla Kingdom, which unified the Korean Peninsula. During the Joseon Dynasty period, the city was the capital of Gyeongsang-do, one of the traditional eight provinces of the country.\nDaegu was an economic motor of Korea during the 1960s\u20131980s period and was especially known for its electronics industry. The humid subtropical climate of Daegu is ideal for producing high-quality apples, thus the nickname, \"Apple City\". Daegu is also known as \"Textile City\". Textiles used to be the pillar industry of the city. With the establishment of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone, Daegu is currently focusing on fostering fashion and high-tech industries.\nDaegu was the host city of the 22nd World Energy Congress, the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, and the 2003 Summer Universiade. It also hosted four matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory and early history ===\nArchaeological investigations in the Greater Daegu area have revealed a large number of settlements and burials of the prehistoric Mumun Pottery Period (around 1500\u2013300 BC). In fact, some of the earliest evidence of Mumun settlement in Gyeongsangdo have been excavated from Siji-dong and Seobyeon-dong. Dongcheon-dong is one of the substantial Mumun agricultural villages that have been excavated. The Dongcheon-dong site dates back to the Middle Mumun (around 850\u2013550 BC) and contains the remains of many prehistoric pit-houses and agricultural fields. Megalithic burials (dolmens) have also been found in large numbers in Daegu.\nAncient historical texts indicate that during the Proto\u2013Three Kingdoms (Mahan, Jinhan, and Byeonhan) period, Daegu was the site of a chiefdom or walled-town polity known from that time, according to historical records, as Dalgubeol. It was absorbed into the kingdom of Silla no later than the fifth century. The vestiges of the wall can be seen, and relics have been excavated in the current Dalseong Park.\n\n\n=== Silla ===\nSilla succeeded in unifying the Korean peninsula by defeating the other kingdoms of Baekje and Koguryo in the late seventh century, partly due to assistance from China's Tang Dynasty. Shortly thereafter, in 689, Silla's King Sinmun considered moving the capital from Gyeongju to Daegu, but was unable to do so.  This initiative is known only through a single line in the Samguk Sagi, a most valued historical record of ancient Korea by Koryeo Dynasty historian Kim Bu-sik, but it is presumed to indicate both an attempt by the Silla king to reinforce royal authority and the entrenched resistance of the Gyeongju political elites that was the likely cause of the move's failure. The city was given its current name in 757.\nIn the late 1990s, archaeologists excavated a large-scale fortified Silla site in Dongcheon-dong, Buk-gu. The site at Locality 2 consists of the remains of 39 raised-floor buildings enclosed by a formidable ditch-and-palisade system. The excavators hypothesize that the fortified site was a permanent military encampment or barracks. Archaeologists also uncovered a large Silla village dating to the sixth to seventh centuries AD at Siji-dong.\n\n\n=== Later Three Kingdoms and Goryeo ===\nDuring the Later Three Kingdoms period, 892\u2013936, Daegu was initially aligned with Hubaekje. In 927, northern Daegu was the site of the Battle of Gong Mountain between the forces of Goryeo under Wang Geon and those of Hubaekje under Gyeon Hwon. In this battle, the forces of Goryeo were crushed and Wang Geon himself was saved only by the heroic deed of his general Shin Sung-gyeom. However,  the atrocities of the Hubaekje forces at this time apparently changed local sympathizers to favor Wang Geon, who later became the king of Goryeo.\nNumerous place names and local legends in the area still bear witness to the historic battle of 927. Among these are \"Ansim\", which literally means \"peace of mind\", said to be the first place where Wang Geon dared to stop after escaping the battle, and \"Banwol\", or half-moon, where he is said to have stopped and admired the moon before returning to Goryeo. A statue commemorating the battle now stands in northern Daegu, as does a memorial to Sin Sunggyeom.\nIn the Goryeo period, the first edition of the Tripitaka Koreana was stored in Daegu, at the temple of Buinsa.  However, this edition was destroyed when the temple was sacked in 1254, during the Mongol invasions of Korea.\n\n\n=== Joseon ===\n\nDaegu served as an important transportation center during the Joseon Dynasty. She stands in the mid part of the Great Yeongnam Road which ran between Seoul and Busan. It lay at the junction of this arterial road and the roads to Gyeongju and Jinju.\nIn 1601, Daegu became the administrative capital of the Gyeongsang-do, which is current Daegu, Busan, Ulsan, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and Gyeongsangnam-do. At about that time, the city began to grow into a major city. The status continued for nearly 300 years, and the city has been transformed as the capital of Gyeongsangbuk-do since Gyeongsang-do was divided into two provinces, Gyeongsangbuk-do (northern Gyeongsang-province) and Gyeongsangnam-do (southern one) in 1896.\nDaegu's first regular markets were established during the late Joseon period. The most famous of these is the Yangnyeongsi herbal medicine market. This became a center of herbal trade in Joseon, and even attracted buyers from neighboring countries. Traders from Japan, who were not permitted to leave the Nakdong River valley, hired messengers to visit the market on their behalf. Seomun Market, which stood at the city's west gate at that time, was one of the top-three markets in the Joseon period.\n\n\n=== Korean Empire and colonial rule ===\nThe Korean hermit kingdom finally opened itself to the outside world in the late 19th century. In 1895, Daegu became the site of one of the country's first modern post offices, as a part of the 'Gab-o' reforms introduced in the aftermath of the Sino-Japanese war.Beginning in the late 1890s, increasing numbers of foreign merchants and workers started to visit Daegu, which emerged as a modern transportation center of the newly constructed Gyeongbu Line main railroad connecting Seoul and Busan.\nIn 1905, the old fortress wall was forcibly destroyed. The wall still survives only in the street names such as the streets Dongseongno and Bukseongno, \"east fortress street\" and \"north fortress street\", which now run where the wall once stood.\nIndependence movements against imperial aggressions were outstanding in Daegu. These began as early as 1898, when a branch of the Independence Club was opened in the town.  As the demise of the Korean Empire approached in 1907, local citizens led by Seo Sang-don organized the National Debt Repayment Movement. The movement spread nationwide, although it fell short of repaying the national debt through individual donations. Freedom fighting continued after the 1910 annexation, notably during the March 1st movement of 1919. At that time, four major demonstrations took place in Daegu, involving an estimated 23,000 peace-loving citizens.\n\n\n=== After 1945 ===\nIn 1946, the Daegu October Incident took place, one of the most serious social disorders since the foundation of the Republic of Korea. An operation by the Korean national police to take control of rioters on October 1 resulted in the death of three student demonstrators and injuries to many others, sparking a massive counter-attack, killing as many as 38 policemen. It was also the site of major demonstrations on February 28, 1960, prior to the presidential election of that year.Daegu and all of North Gyeongsang province had heavy guerrilla activities in the late 1940s, as thousands of refugees shied away from the fighting in Jeolla province and sought shelters in Daegu.  In November 1948, a unit in Daegu joined the mutiny which had begun in Yeosu the previous month.During the Korean War, heavy fighting occurred nearby along the Nakdong River. Daegu sat inside the Pusan Perimeter, however, so remained in South Korean hands throughout the war. As in many other areas during the Korean War, political killings of dissenters were widespread. A large series of engagements was fought around the city to prevent North Korean troops from crossing the Nakdong, the Battle of Taegu.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the city underwent explosive growth, and the population has increased more than tenfold since the end of the Korean War. The city was politically favored during the 18-year-long rule of Park Chung-hee, when it and the surrounding area served as his political base. Daegu champions conservative political ideas and movements today and is a political base for the Saenuri Party.\nIn the 1980s, Daegu separated from Gyeongsangbuk-do and became a separately administered provincial-level directly governed city (Jikhalsi), and was redesignated as a metropolitan city (Gwangyeoksi) in 1995. Today, Daegu is the third-largest metropolitan area in Korea with respect to both population and commerce.\nIn February 2020, Daegu became known for the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nTwo local governments are in the city, the Daegu Metropolitan Government in Jung District and Gyeongbuk Provincial Government in Buk District. The provincial government will be relocated to Andong in its proper province, Gyeongbuk. The mayor and heads of city's eight districts are directly elected by the citizens every four years. The city council has 29 members which consist of 26 from the same number of electoral districts and three proportional representations. They are also directly elected every four years. Most of them are the members of the Liberty Korea Party, the main conservative political party in South Korea. Daegu is a stronghold for the party and has produced two Presidents of the Republic of Korea thus far: Roh Tae-woo and Park Geun-hye. As the capital of the Korean conservatives, the city has wielded strong political influence in elections.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nDaegu is divided into 7 districts (Gu) and 1 county (Gun)\n\nJung District (\uc911\uad6c, \u4e2d\u5340) \u2013 means the central district.\nDong District (\ub3d9\uad6c, \u6771\u5340) \u2013 means the east district.\nSeo District (\uc11c\uad6c, \u897f\u5340) \u2013 means the west district.\nNam District (\ub0a8\uad6c, \u5357\u5340) \u2013 means the south district.\nBuk District (\ubd81\uad6c, \u5317\u5340) \u2013 means the north district.\nSuseong District (\uc218\uc131\uad6c, \u58fd\u57ce\u5340)\nDalseo District (\ub2ec\uc11c\uad6c, \u9054\u897f\u5340)\nDalseong County (\ub2ec\uc131\uad70, \u9054\u57ce\u90e1)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nDaegu sits in a basin surrounded by low mountains. Palgongsan to the north, Biseulsan to the south, Waryongsan to the west, and a series of smaller hills in the east. The Geumho River flows along the northern and eastern edges of the city, emptying in the Nakdong River west of the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDaegu has a cooler version of a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa). In Holdridge climate classification, Daegu has a warm temperate moist forest climate. The mountains that comprise the basin trap hot and humid air. Similarly, in winter, cold air lies in the basin. The area receives little precipitation except during the rainy season of summer, and is sunny throughout much of the year. Data gathered since 1961 indicates that the mean temperature for January, the coldest month in Daegu, is 0.6 \u00b0C (33 \u00b0F) and that for August, the warmest month, is 26.4 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F). The City's lowest record temperature was \u221220.2 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F), and the City's highest record temperature was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F). The 40 degrees Celsius recorded in 1942 is also the highest temperature record in South Korea since the observation. This summer temperature has led to the emergence of a new term called Dae-Prika (Daegu+Africa) starting with the Internet community, and has recently been used in the media, broadcasting, etc. \n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nDaegu is a manufacturing industry city. The major industries are textiles, metals and machinery. In the year 2010, Daegu had a regional GDP of $45,387 million with 7.2% real GDP growth rate. The GDP per capita though is well below Korea national average. Many companies such as Daegu Bank, Korea Delphi, Hwasung corp., and TaeguTec are situated in this city, and Samsung and Kolon were founded here. Numerous factories are located in the industrial complexes situated in the west and north sides of the city including the Seongseo Industrial Complex, West Daegu Industrial Complex and the Daegu Dyeing Industrial Complex.\nThe city is the economic and industrial core of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk region, one of the major industrial areas in Korea. It accounted for as much as 94 percent of Korea's trade surplus in 2006. The electronics industries in Gumi and the steel industries in Pohang provided great services to that surplus. World-leading manufacturing facilities for Anycall (Samsung Mobile) and POSCO's main factories are located near the city. Daegu and its neighbouring cities were designated for the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone by the central government in 2008. It is specialized companies like Winitech software company in knowledge-based service and manufacturing industries.\nHistorically, Daegu has been the commercial center of the southern part of the Korean Peninsula with Seoul in the center and Pyongyang in the north (currently North Korea), because of its advantageous location. Some of the large, traditional markets like Seomun Market are still flourishing in the city.\nAdditionally, Daegu was considered the third major economic city in Korea, after Seoul and Busan. However, due to the decline of the textile industry, which is the heart of Daegu's economy, the overall economic growth of the city has also fallen.\nAlso, the city is the warmest region in South Korea due to the humid subtropical climate. This climate condition provides the region with high quality apples and oriental melons. The fruit industry is a crucial support for the local economy. Due to the stagnant economy, Daegu's population began to decrease after 2003. Recently, the local government has begun focusing on working towards economic revival and concentrating on improving the city's fashion industry.\n\n\n=== Fashion industry ===\nBeginning in the late 1990s, Daegu has been actively making efforts to promote its fashion industry based on its textile and clothing manufacturing industries under the 'Daegu: Fashion City'. The city opens many exhibitions related to the fashion and textile industries including the Daegu Fashion Fair and Preview in Daegu annually or semi-annually, and invites national institutes. A large new town specializing in the textile-fashion industries is currently under construction in Bongmu-dong, northeastern Daegu. The district, officially named Esiapolis, takes aim at the fashion hub of East Asia. Textile complexes, textile-fashion institutions, an international school, fashion malls as well as residential areas plan to be developed in the district.\n\n\n== Culture and sightseeing ==\n\nGenerally Daegu is known as a conservative city. As well as being the largest inland city in the country beside Seoul it has become one of the major metropolitan areas in the nation. Traditionally, Buddhism has been strong; today there are still many temples. Confucianism is also popular in Daegu, with a large academy based in the city. Neon cross-topped spires of Christian churches can also be seen in the city.\n\n\n=== Sights ===\nThe most well-known sight of the city is the stone Buddha called Gatbawi on the top of Gwanbong, Palgongsan. It is famous for its stone gat (Korean traditional hat). People from all over the country visit the place, because they believe that the Buddha will grant one's single desire. Administratively, the site itself is located in the neighboring city, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk.\n\nOn the outskirts of the city, mountains keep many traditional temples such as Donghwasa, Pagyesa, and Buinsa. Donghwasa is a Buddhist temple that was built by Priest Geukdal-hwasang in 493, and many artifacts of the period are found around the temple. The International Tourist Zen Meditation Center is Korea's only Zen-themed center. Some lecture halls or memorial halls such as Dodong-seowon (\ub3c4\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9053\u6771\u66f8\u9662) and Nokdong-seowon (\ub179\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9e7f\u6d1e\u66f8\u9662) are also located in the suburbs.\nOld villages have been preserved, such as the Otgol village (Gyeongju Choi clan's original residence area) and the Inheung village (Nampyeong Mun's). In the urban area, the Joseon Dynasty's administrative or educational buildings including Gyeongsang-gamyeong (\uacbd\uc0c1\uac10\uc601, \u6176\u5c19\u76e3\u71df) and Daegu-hyanggyo (\ub300\uad6c\ud5a5\uad50, \u5927\u90b1\u9115\u6821) also remain. The main gateway of the city in that period called Yeongnam-jeilmun (\uc601\ub0a8\uc81c\uc77c\ubb38, \u5dba\u5357\u7b2c\u4e00\u9580, meaning the first gateway in Yeongnam), has been restored in Mangudang Park. Western style modern architecture like Gyesan Cathedral and the old building of Jeil Church are preserved across the urban area. Gyesan Cathedral is the third oldest gothic church building in Korea and the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Daegu which is one of three archdioceses in South Korea. Several buildings, in the present Keisung Academy and the KNU middle/high school, are famous too.\nYangnyeongsi (\uc57d\ub839\uc2dc, \u85e5\u4ee4\u5e02) in Namseongno (often called Yakjeon-golmok) is the oldest market for Korean medicinal herbs in the country with a history of 350 years. Bongsan-dong which has some art galleries and studios is being developed as the artistic center of the city since the 1990s.\nNearby tourist attractions include Haeinsa\u2014a Buddhist temple that houses the Tripitaka Koreana (a woodblock edition of the Tripitaka and one of the world's oldest extant complete collections of the Buddhist scriptures). Haeinsa is located in Gayasan National Park of Hapcheon, Gyeongnam. The historic city of Gyeongju, Gyeongbuk, the capital of the ancient kingdom of Silla is located east of Daegu.\n\n\n=== Mountains and parks ===\n\nMt. Palgong, Mt. Biseul, and Mt. Ap are the representative mountains in Daegu. Apsan, just in the southern part of the city, is the closest mountain from the urban area among them. It has many trails, Buddhist temples, a Korean War museum, and a gondola ride to the peak. Additionally, Waryongsan, Hamjisan, and Yongjibong are located in the city. These serve as neighborhood parks to the citizens. Mt. Palgong has a cable car to the summit. There are also hiking trails in the direction of the Donghwasa Temple and Sutaegol Valley.\nIn the urban area, several small mountains and hills play the same role. Dalseong Park, which sits inside a 1,500-year-old earth fortress, is a historic place of the city. It contains the city's only zoo and some monuments as well as the wall. Duryu Park or Duryusan is a large forest in the middle of the urban area. It has Daegu Tower, Woobang Land, Kolon Bandstand, Duryu Stadium, and many sports facilities. Daegu Tower, also called Woobang Tower or Duryu Tower, is the tallest contemporary structure (202 m) and a symbol of the city. Its observatory commands good views of the surroundings. Woobang Land is the largest amusement park out of the capital area. Many small gardens lie in the heart of the city, such as the National Debt Repayment Movement Memorial Park (Gukchae Bosang Park) and 2\u00b728 Park. The former park includes Dalgubeol-daejong (\ub2ec\uad6c\ubc8c\ub300\uc885, \u9054\u53e5\u4f10\u5927\u9418), which means the Dalgubeol grand bell. The bell is struck every week and year. There is also a botanical garden with a variety of plants and flowers.\n\n\n=== Downtown and shopping ===\nDongseongno (\ub3d9\uc131\ub85c, \u6771\u57ce\u8def) is the downtown of Daegu lying from the Daegu Station to Jung-ang pachulso (central police station) near the Banwoldang subway station in the center of the city Jung-gu. It has the Jung-angno subway station as the nearest station from its heart. Like its name meaning the street in the east fortress, the eastern part of Daegu-eupseong (\ub300\uad6c\uc74d\uc131, \u5927\u90b1\u9091\u57ce, means the Daegu-Principality Fortress) was situated along this street. The fortress, however, had been demolished in the early 20th century. Although Daegu is the nation's third or fourth largest city, the Dongseongno area form the largest and the broadest downtown area in the whole country except the capital city, Seoul.  In most cases, famous brands open their branch shop first here out of the Greater Seoul area.\n\nSub-downtowns in the city have its own commercial powers and colors. The area around the Seongseo Industrial Complex subway station in Dalseo-gu is a concentration of many amusement spots, and young people easily can be seen around Kyungpook National University in Buk-gu. Deuran-gil (means the street inside the field) in Suseong-gu is known for many restaurants.\nThe city has a number of department stores. Many of these belong to national or multinational chains, but the local Daegu Department Store also operates two branches, while another local chain, Donga Department Store operates four in the city proper. The six department stores among them gather at the downtown. The traditional markets such as Seomun Market and Chilseong Market sell all sorts of goods.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nMany traditional ceremonies and festivals in agrarian society disappeared in the process of modernization. A Confucian ritual ceremony called Seokjeondaeje is held at Daegu-hyanggyo every spring and autumn. The Yangnyeongsi herb medical festival and Otgol village festival are the contemporary festivals about traditional culture.\nLately in the city, enthusiasm about performing arts is growing and the local government is trying to meet its demand. Daegu International Opera Festival (DIOF) in October since 2003, Daegu International Musical Festival (DIMF), and Daegu International Bodypainting Festival (DIBF) are three of the most famous festivals on each field in Korea, although those have short histories.\nVarious festivals in various themes like the Colorful Daegu Festival, Dongseongno festival, Palgongsan maple festival, Biseulsan azalea festival, Korea in Motion Daegu, and so on, are held by the city, each ward, or the specific groups, all through the year.\nOn August 25 through August 31, 2008, Daegu hosted the first ever Asian Bodypainting Festival, a sister event of the World Bodypainting Festival in Seeboden, Austria.\nEach year the city is home to the Daegu International Jazz Festival: http://www.dijf.or.kr/\nEvery May the \"Colorful Daegu Festival\" offers performances and art programs including the Colorful Parade.

        "wiki": "Daegu (Korean: [t\u025b\u0261u]; \ub300\uad6c, \u5927\u90b1, literally 'large hill'\ub300\uad6c\uad11\uc5ed\uc2dc), formerly spelled Taegu and officially known as the Daegu Metropolitan City, is a city in South Korea, the fourth-largest after Seoul, Busan, and Incheon and the third-largest metropolitan area in the nation with over 2.5 million residents. Also, it is the second largest city in the Yeongnam region after Busan. However, it is the fourth city in terms of population after Seoul, Busan and Incheon. It was overtaken by Incheon in the 2000s, but still it is said to be the third city according to the \"Act on the Establishment of Daegu City and Incheon City\" (Act No. 3424 and April 13, 1981). Daegu and surrounding North Gyeongsang Province are often referred to as Daegu-Gyeongbuk, with a total population over 5 million. \nDaegu is located in south-eastern Korea about 80 km (50 mi) from the seacoast, near the Geumho River and its mainstream, Nakdong River in Gyeongsang-do. The Daegu basin is the central plain of the Yeongnam region. In ancient times, the Daegu area was part of the proto-kingdom Jinhan. Subsequently, Daegu came under the control of the Silla Kingdom, which unified the Korean Peninsula. During the Joseon Dynasty period, the city was the capital of Gyeongsang-do, one of the traditional eight provinces of the country.\nDaegu was an economic motor of Korea during the 1960s\u20131980s period and was especially known for its electronics industry. The humid subtropical climate of Daegu is ideal for producing high-quality apples, thus the nickname, \"Apple City\". Daegu is also known as \"Textile City\". Textiles used to be the pillar industry of the city. With the establishment of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone, Daegu is currently focusing on fostering fashion and high-tech industries.\nDaegu was the host city of the 22nd World Energy Congress, the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, and the 2003 Summer Universiade. It also hosted four matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory and early history ===\nArchaeological investigations in the Greater Daegu area have revealed a large number of settlements and burials of the prehistoric Mumun Pottery Period (around 1500\u2013300 BC). In fact, some of the earliest evidence of Mumun settlement in Gyeongsangdo have been excavated from Siji-dong and Seobyeon-dong. Dongcheon-dong is one of the substantial Mumun agricultural villages that have been excavated. The Dongcheon-dong site dates back to the Middle Mumun (around 850\u2013550 BC) and contains the remains of many prehistoric pit-houses and agricultural fields. Megalithic burials (dolmens) have also been found in large numbers in Daegu.\nAncient historical texts indicate that during the Proto\u2013Three Kingdoms (Mahan, Jinhan, and Byeonhan) period, Daegu was the site of a chiefdom or walled-town polity known from that time, according to historical records, as Dalgubeol. It was absorbed into the kingdom of Silla no later than the fifth century. The vestiges of the wall can be seen, and relics have been excavated in the current Dalseong Park.\n\n\n=== Silla ===\nSilla succeeded in unifying the Korean peninsula by defeating the other kingdoms of Baekje and Koguryo in the late seventh century, partly due to assistance from China's Tang Dynasty. Shortly thereafter, in 689, Silla's King Sinmun considered moving the capital from Gyeongju to Daegu, but was unable to do so.  This initiative is known only through a single line in the Samguk Sagi, a most valued historical record of ancient Korea by Koryeo Dynasty historian Kim Bu-sik, but it is presumed to indicate both an attempt by the Silla king to reinforce royal authority and the entrenched resistance of the Gyeongju political elites that was the likely cause of the move's failure. The city was given its current name in 757.\nIn the late 1990s, archaeologists excavated a large-scale fortified Silla site in Dongcheon-dong, Buk-gu. The site at Locality 2 consists of the remains of 39 raised-floor buildings enclosed by a formidable ditch-and-palisade system. The excavators hypothesize that the fortified site was a permanent military encampment or barracks. Archaeologists also uncovered a large Silla village dating to the sixth to seventh centuries AD at Siji-dong.\n\n\n=== Later Three Kingdoms and Goryeo ===\nDuring the Later Three Kingdoms period, 892\u2013936, Daegu was initially aligned with Hubaekje. In 927, northern Daegu was the site of the Battle of Gong Mountain between the forces of Goryeo under Wang Geon and those of Hubaekje under Gyeon Hwon. In this battle, the forces of Goryeo were crushed and Wang Geon himself was saved only by the heroic deed of his general Shin Sung-gyeom. However,  the atrocities of the Hubaekje forces at this time apparently changed local sympathizers to favor Wang Geon, who later became the king of Goryeo.\nNumerous place names and local legends in the area still bear witness to the historic battle of 927. Among these are \"Ansim\", which literally means \"peace of mind\", said to be the first place where Wang Geon dared to stop after escaping the battle, and \"Banwol\", or half-moon, where he is said to have stopped and admired the moon before returning to Goryeo. A statue commemorating the battle now stands in northern Daegu, as does a memorial to Sin Sunggyeom.\nIn the Goryeo period, the first edition of the Tripitaka Koreana was stored in Daegu, at the temple of Buinsa.  However, this edition was destroyed when the temple was sacked in 1254, during the Mongol invasions of Korea.\n\n\n=== Joseon ===\n\nDaegu served as an important transportation center during the Joseon Dynasty. She stands in the mid part of the Great Yeongnam Road which ran between Seoul and Busan. It lay at the junction of this arterial road and the roads to Gyeongju and Jinju.\nIn 1601, Daegu became the administrative capital of the Gyeongsang-do, which is current Daegu, Busan, Ulsan, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and Gyeongsangnam-do. At about that time, the city began to grow into a major city. The status continued for nearly 300 years, and the city has been transformed as the capital of Gyeongsangbuk-do since Gyeongsang-do was divided into two provinces, Gyeongsangbuk-do (northern Gyeongsang-province) and Gyeongsangnam-do (southern one) in 1896.\nDaegu's first regular markets were established during the late Joseon period. The most famous of these is the Yangnyeongsi herbal medicine market. This became a center of herbal trade in Joseon, and even attracted buyers from neighboring countries. Traders from Japan, who were not permitted to leave the Nakdong River valley, hired messengers to visit the market on their behalf. Seomun Market, which stood at the city's west gate at that time, was one of the top-three markets in the Joseon period.\n\n\n=== Korean Empire and colonial rule ===\nThe Korean hermit kingdom finally opened itself to the outside world in the late 19th century. In 1895, Daegu became the site of one of the country's first modern post offices, as a part of the 'Gab-o' reforms introduced in the aftermath of the Sino-Japanese war.Beginning in the late 1890s, increasing numbers of foreign merchants and workers started to visit Daegu, which emerged as a modern transportation center of the newly constructed Gyeongbu Line main railroad connecting Seoul and Busan.\nIn 1905, the old fortress wall was forcibly destroyed. The wall still survives only in the street names such as the streets Dongseongno and Bukseongno, \"east fortress street\" and \"north fortress street\", which now run where the wall once stood.\nIndependence movements against imperial aggressions were outstanding in Daegu. These began as early as 1898, when a branch of the Independence Club was opened in the town.  As the demise of the Korean Empire approached in 1907, local citizens led by Seo Sang-don organized the National Debt Repayment Movement. The movement spread nationwide, although it fell short of repaying the national debt through individual donations. Freedom fighting continued after the 1910 annexation, notably during the March 1st movement of 1919. At that time, four major demonstrations took place in Daegu, involving an estimated 23,000 peace-loving citizens.\n\n\n=== After 1945 ===\nIn 1946, the Daegu October Incident took place, one of the most serious social disorders since the foundation of the Republic of Korea. An operation by the Korean national police to take control of rioters on October 1 resulted in the death of three student demonstrators and injuries to many others, sparking a massive counter-attack, killing as many as 38 policemen. It was also the site of major demonstrations on February 28, 1960, prior to the presidential election of that year.Daegu and all of North Gyeongsang province had heavy guerrilla activities in the late 1940s, as thousands of refugees shied away from the fighting in Jeolla province and sought shelters in Daegu.  In November 1948, a unit in Daegu joined the mutiny which had begun in Yeosu the previous month.During the Korean War, heavy fighting occurred nearby along the Nakdong River. Daegu sat inside the Pusan Perimeter, however, so remained in South Korean hands throughout the war. As in many other areas during the Korean War, political killings of dissenters were widespread. A large series of engagements was fought around the city to prevent North Korean troops from crossing the Nakdong, the Battle of Taegu.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the city underwent explosive growth, and the population has increased more than tenfold since the end of the Korean War. The city was politically favored during the 18-year-long rule of Park Chung-hee, when it and the surrounding area served as his political base. Daegu champions conservative political ideas and movements today and is a political base for the Saenuri Party.\nIn the 1980s, Daegu separated from Gyeongsangbuk-do and became a separately administered provincial-level directly governed city (Jikhalsi), and was redesignated as a metropolitan city (Gwangyeoksi) in 1995. Today, Daegu is the third-largest metropolitan area in Korea with respect to both population and commerce.\nIn February 2020, Daegu became known for the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nTwo local governments are in the city, the Daegu Metropolitan Government in Jung District and Gyeongbuk Provincial Government in Buk District. The provincial government will be relocated to Andong in its proper province, Gyeongbuk. The mayor and heads of city's eight districts are directly elected by the citizens every four years. The city council has 29 members which consist of 26 from the same number of electoral districts and three proportional representations. They are also directly elected every four years. Most of them are the members of the Liberty Korea Party, the main conservative political party in South Korea. Daegu is a stronghold for the party and has produced two Presidents of the Republic of Korea thus far: Roh Tae-woo and Park Geun-hye. As the capital of the Korean conservatives, the city has wielded strong political influence in elections.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nDaegu is divided into 7 districts (Gu) and 1 county (Gun)\n\nJung District (\uc911\uad6c, \u4e2d\u5340) \u2013 means the central district.\nDong District (\ub3d9\uad6c, \u6771\u5340) \u2013 means the east district.\nSeo District (\uc11c\uad6c, \u897f\u5340) \u2013 means the west district.\nNam District (\ub0a8\uad6c, \u5357\u5340) \u2013 means the south district.\nBuk District (\ubd81\uad6c, \u5317\u5340) \u2013 means the north district.\nSuseong District (\uc218\uc131\uad6c, \u58fd\u57ce\u5340)\nDalseo District (\ub2ec\uc11c\uad6c, \u9054\u897f\u5340)\nDalseong County (\ub2ec\uc131\uad70, \u9054\u57ce\u90e1)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nDaegu sits in a basin surrounded by low mountains. Palgongsan to the north, Biseulsan to the south, Waryongsan to the west, and a series of smaller hills in the east. The Geumho River flows along the northern and eastern edges of the city, emptying in the Nakdong River west of the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDaegu has a cooler version of a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa). In Holdridge climate classification, Daegu has a warm temperate moist forest climate. The mountains that comprise the basin trap hot and humid air. Similarly, in winter, cold air lies in the basin. The area receives little precipitation except during the rainy season of summer, and is sunny throughout much of the year. Data gathered since 1961 indicates that the mean temperature for January, the coldest month in Daegu, is 0.6 \u00b0C (33 \u00b0F) and that for August, the warmest month, is 26.4 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F). The City's lowest record temperature was \u221220.2 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F), and the City's highest record temperature was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F). The 40 degrees Celsius recorded in 1942 is also the highest temperature record in South Korea since the observation. This summer temperature has led to the emergence of a new term called Dae-Prika (Daegu+Africa) starting with the Internet community, and has recently been used in the media, broadcasting, etc. \n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nDaegu is a manufacturing industry city. The major industries are textiles, metals and machinery. In the year 2010, Daegu had a regional GDP of $45,387 million with 7.2% real GDP growth rate. The GDP per capita though is well below Korea national average. Many companies such as Daegu Bank, Korea Delphi, Hwasung corp., and TaeguTec are situated in this city, and Samsung and Kolon were founded here. Numerous factories are located in the industrial complexes situated in the west and north sides of the city including the Seongseo Industrial Complex, West Daegu Industrial Complex and the Daegu Dyeing Industrial Complex.\nThe city is the economic and industrial core of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk region, one of the major industrial areas in Korea. It accounted for as much as 94 percent of Korea's trade surplus in 2006. The electronics industries in Gumi and the steel industries in Pohang provided great services to that surplus. World-leading manufacturing facilities for Anycall (Samsung Mobile) and POSCO's main factories are located near the city. Daegu and its neighbouring cities were designated for the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone by the central government in 2008. It is specialized companies like Winitech software company in knowledge-based service and manufacturing industries.\nHistorically, Daegu has been the commercial center of the southern part of the Korean Peninsula with Seoul in the center and Pyongyang in the north (currently North Korea), because of its advantageous location. Some of the large, traditional markets like Seomun Market are still flourishing in the city.\nAdditionally, Daegu was considered the third major economic city in Korea, after Seoul and Busan. However, due to the decline of the textile industry, which is the heart of Daegu's economy, the overall economic growth of the city has also fallen.\nAlso, the city is the warmest region in South Korea due to the humid subtropical climate. This climate condition provides the region with high quality apples and oriental melons. The fruit industry is a crucial support for the local economy. Due to the stagnant economy, Daegu's population began to decrease after 2003. Recently, the local government has begun focusing on working towards economic revival and concentrating on improving the city's fashion industry.\n\n\n=== Fashion industry ===\nBeginning in the late 1990s, Daegu has been actively making efforts to promote its fashion industry based on its textile and clothing manufacturing industries under the 'Daegu: Fashion City'. The city opens many exhibitions related to the fashion and textile industries including the Daegu Fashion Fair and Preview in Daegu annually or semi-annually, and invites national institutes. A large new town specializing in the textile-fashion industries is currently under construction in Bongmu-dong, northeastern Daegu. The district, officially named Esiapolis, takes aim at the fashion hub of East Asia. Textile complexes, textile-fashion institutions, an international school, fashion malls as well as residential areas plan to be developed in the district.\n\n\n== Culture and sightseeing ==\n\nGenerally Daegu is known as a conservative city. As well as being the largest inland city in the country beside Seoul it has become one of the major metropolitan areas in the nation. Traditionally, Buddhism has been strong; today there are still many temples. Confucianism is also popular in Daegu, with a large academy based in the city. Neon cross-topped spires of Christian churches can also be seen in the city.\n\n\n=== Sights ===\nThe most well-known sight of the city is the stone Buddha called Gatbawi on the top of Gwanbong, Palgongsan. It is famous for its stone gat (Korean traditional hat). People from all over the country visit the place, because they believe that the Buddha will grant one's single desire. Administratively, the site itself is located in the neighboring city, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk.\n\nOn the outskirts of the city, mountains keep many traditional temples such as Donghwasa, Pagyesa, and Buinsa. Donghwasa is a Buddhist temple that was built by Priest Geukdal-hwasang in 493, and many artifacts of the period are found around the temple. The International Tourist Zen Meditation Center is Korea's only Zen-themed center. Some lecture halls or memorial halls such as Dodong-seowon (\ub3c4\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9053\u6771\u66f8\u9662) and Nokdong-seowon (\ub179\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9e7f\u6d1e\u66f8\u9662) are also located in the suburbs.\nOld villages have been preserved, such as the Otgol village (Gyeongju Choi clan's original residence area) and the Inheung village (Nampyeong Mun's). In the urban area, the Joseon Dynasty's administrative or educational buildings including Gyeongsang-gamyeong (\uacbd\uc0c1\uac10\uc601, \u6176\u5c19\u76e3\u71df) and Daegu-hyanggyo (\ub300\uad6c\ud5a5\uad50, \u5927\u90b1\u9115\u6821) also remain. The main gateway of the city in that period called Yeongnam-jeilmun (\uc601\ub0a8\uc81c\uc77c\ubb38, \u5dba\u5357\u7b2c\u4e00\u9580, meaning the first gateway in Yeongnam), has been restored in Mangudang Park. Western style modern architecture like Gyesan Cathedral and the old building of Jeil Church are preserved across the urban area. Gyesan Cathedral is the third oldest gothic church building in Korea and the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Daegu which is one of three archdioceses in South Korea. Several buildings, in the present Keisung Academy and the KNU middle/high school, are famous too.\nYangnyeongsi (\uc57d\ub839\uc2dc, \u85e5\u4ee4\u5e02) in Namseongno (often called Yakjeon-golmok) is the oldest market for Korean medicinal herbs in the country with a history of 350 years. Bongsan-dong which has some art galleries and studios is being developed as the artistic center of the city since the 1990s.\nNearby tourist attractions include Haeinsa\u2014a Buddhist temple that houses the Tripitaka Koreana (a woodblock edition of the Tripitaka and one of the world's oldest extant complete collections of the Buddhist scriptures). Haeinsa is located in Gayasan National Park of Hapcheon, Gyeongnam. The historic city of Gyeongju, Gyeongbuk, the capital of the ancient kingdom of Silla is located east of Daegu.\n\n\n=== Mountains and parks ===\n\nMt. Palgong, Mt. Biseul, and Mt. Ap are the representative mountains in Daegu. Apsan, just in the southern part of the city, is the closest mountain from the urban area among them. It has many trails, Buddhist temples, a Korean War museum, and a gondola ride to the peak. Additionally, Waryongsan, Hamjisan, and Yongjibong are located in the city. These serve as neighborhood parks to the citizens. Mt. Palgong has a cable car to the summit. There are also hiking trails in the direction of the Donghwasa Temple and Sutaegol Valley.\nIn the urban area, several small mountains and hills play the same role. Dalseong Park, which sits inside a 1,500-year-old earth fortress, is a historic place of the city. It contains the city's only zoo and some monuments as well as the wall. Duryu Park or Duryusan is a large forest in the middle of the urban area. It has Daegu Tower, Woobang Land, Kolon Bandstand, Duryu Stadium, and many sports facilities. Daegu Tower, also called Woobang Tower or Duryu Tower, is the tallest contemporary structure (202 m) and a symbol of the city. Its observatory commands good views of the surroundings. Woobang Land is the largest amusement park out of the capital area. Many small gardens lie in the heart of the city, such as the National Debt Repayment Movement Memorial Park (Gukchae Bosang Park) and 2\u00b728 Park. The former park includes Dalgubeol-daejong (\ub2ec\uad6c\ubc8c\ub300\uc885, \u9054\u53e5\u4f10\u5927\u9418), which means the Dalgubeol grand bell. The bell is struck every week and year. There is also a botanical garden with a variety of plants and flowers.\n\n\n=== Downtown and shopping ===\nDongseongno (\ub3d9\uc131\ub85c, \u6771\u57ce\u8def) is the downtown of Daegu lying from the Daegu Station to Jung-ang pachulso (central police station) near the Banwoldang subway station in the center of the city Jung-gu. It has the Jung-angno subway station as the nearest station from its heart. Like its name meaning the street in the east fortress, the eastern part of Daegu-eupseong (\ub300\uad6c\uc74d\uc131, \u5927\u90b1\u9091\u57ce, means the Daegu-Principality Fortress) was situated along this street. The fortress, however, had been demolished in the early 20th century. Although Daegu is the nation's third or fourth largest city, the Dongseongno area form the largest and the broadest downtown area in the whole country except the capital city, Seoul.  In most cases, famous brands open their branch shop first here out of the Greater Seoul area.\n\nSub-downtowns in the city have its own commercial powers and colors. The area around the Seongseo Industrial Complex subway station in Dalseo-gu is a concentration of many amusement spots, and young people easily can be seen around Kyungpook National University in Buk-gu. Deuran-gil (means the street inside the field) in Suseong-gu is known for many restaurants.\nThe city has a number of department stores. Many of these belong to national or multinational chains, but the local Daegu Department Store also operates two branches, while another local chain, Donga Department Store operates four in the city proper. The six department stores among them gather at the downtown. The traditional markets such as Seomun Market and Chilseong Market sell all sorts of goods.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nMany traditional ceremonies and festivals in agrarian society disappeared in the process of modernization. A Confucian ritual ceremony called Seokjeondaeje is held at Daegu-hyanggyo every spring and autumn. The Yangnyeongsi herb medical festival and Otgol village festival are the contemporary festivals about traditional culture.\nLately in the city, enthusiasm about performing arts is growing and the local government is trying to meet its demand. Daegu International Opera Festival (DIOF) in October since 2003, Daegu International Musical Festival (DIMF), and Daegu International Bodypainting Festival (DIBF) are three of the most famous festivals on each field in Korea, although those have short histories.\nVarious festivals in various themes like the Colorful Daegu Festival, Dongseongno festival, Palgongsan maple festival, Biseulsan azalea festival, Korea in Motion Daegu, and so on, are held by the city, each ward, or the specific groups, all through the year.\nOn August 25 through August 31, 2008, Daegu hosted the first ever Asian Bodypainting Festival, a sister event of the World Bodypainting Festival in Seeboden, Austria.\nEach year the city is home to the Daegu International Jazz Festival: http://www.dijf.or.kr/\nEvery May the \"Colorful Daegu Festival\" offers performances and art programs including the Colorful Parade. In July, the Daegu Chimac Festival takes place at Duryu Park in Dalseo-gu, Daegu. The term \"chimac\" is a portmanteau of chicken and maekju (meaning \"beer\"). There were over 880,000 visitors in 2015, and one million visitors during the festival in 2016.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nDaegu Art Museum\nDaegu National Museum \u2013 A notable national museum collecting relics excavated in and around Daegu\nDaegu Bangjja Yugi (Korean Bronzeware) Museum\nHengso Museum of Keimyung University\nKorea Video Museum\nKyungpook National University Museum\nMuseum for Daegu National University of Education\nMuseum of Natural Dye Arts\n\n\n=== Theaters ===\nDaegu Opera House \u2013 The first theater in Korea only for performing opera\nSuseong Artpia\nKeimyung Art Center \u2013 One of the largest scale theaters in the city.\nDaegu Culture and Arts Center\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nOn March 27, 2007, the city was selected to host the 2011 World Championships in Athletics.

        "wiki": "Kim Kwang-seok (Hangul: \uae40\uad11\uc11d [kim.kw\u0250\u014bs\u028ck]; January 22, 1964 \u2013 January 6, 1996) was a popular and influential South Korean folk rock singer. He debuted in 1987 as a member of Noraereul Channeun Saramdeul, an activist folk band. He achieved widespread popularity as a member of the folk band Dongmulwon, which debuted in 1988. The following year, in 1989, he released his first solo album.His songs were popular for their sentimental lyrics that critics said \"portrayed individuals' sorrow and frustration at a time when the society was struggling in its early stage of democracy following rapid industrialization.\" He sold over 5 million records, an impressive number for a South Korean musical artist.He committed suicide by hanging himself.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nKim Kwang-seok was born on January 22, 1964 in Daegu, South Korea. He had two older brothers and two older sisters. His family moved to Seoul in 1968, after Kim's father lost his job as a teacher due to his involvement in an illegal teachers' union. In elementary school, Kim studied the violin, oboe, and flute, and in high school he joined the choir. In 1982, he enrolled in Myongji University to study business, during which time he got a part-time job singing at a cafe. In 1984, Kim joined the Seoul National University singing association and took part in Kim Min-ki's musical play Gaettongi (\uac1c\ub625\uc774). He joined the army in 1985, and was discharged following the death of his eldest brother. Kim then returned to school and joined the student activist folk band Noraereul Channeun Saramdeul (\ub178\ub798\ub97c \ucc3e\ub294 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4) in 1987.\n\n\n== Dongmulwon years ==\nIn 1988, Kim Kwang-seok and other student musicians formed a folk rock band called Dongmulwon (\ub3d9\ubb3c\uc6d0). The band caught the attention of Kim Chang-wan, the main singer of influential South Korean rock band Sanulrim, who publicly supported Dongmulwon, helping the band become more popular. Kim Kwang-seok released two albums with the band in 1988. Dongmulwon continued to release albums with varying line-ups after Kim's departure. In 2014, a musical about Kim and his years in Dongmulwon, called That Summer, Dongmulwon - The Zoo, debuted in South Korea.\n\n\n== Solo career ==\nEncouraged by the unexpected success of Dongmulwon, Kim Kwang-seok released his first solo album in October 1989. This was followed by another two consecutive albums in 1991 and 1992, in which he made a number of hit songs including \u2018Love Has Gone\u2019 (\uc0ac\ub791\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc) and \u2018Song of My Life\u2019 (\ub098\uc758 \ub178\ub798). Unlike many other entertainers, he earned his fame by singing at concerts along with release of records rather than appearing in TV music show. \u201cI\u2019m still unused to the popularity that I gained, but I rather enjoy it.\u201d He spoke to reporter after getting off to a flying start, \u201cNevertheless, I\u2019m also afraid that my confidence in the power of songs to affect people\u2019s life is growing weaker, as I prosper.\u201d Later, he tried to get closer to audiences by holding more concerts than before. In July 1993, he celebrated the 10th anniversary of his own debut by holding a month-long concert. Also, he released a remake album of Korean folk rock, initiating fads of remake among Korean singers.\nWith his 4th studio album released in 1994, his musical talent was consummated. This album was monumental not only in his career but also in the history of Korean popular music. He kept singing at concerts, marking a thousand concert in August 1995. In the same year he made a concert tour around the country, which extended abroad to hold concerts at University of Pennsylvania and Merkin Concert Hall in Manhattan. He preferred small concert halls to be in closer contact with audiences, setting a trend of concert in small theatres around Daehangno in Seoul, a Korean equivalent of Broadway.\n\n\n== Death ==\nOn January 6, 1996, Kim was found dead in his house around dawn with a cord around his neck. The police deemed it a suicide. However, allegations by his family members were made that it was a murder, all of which were unsubstantiated. Events and projects have been organized in commemoration of Kim Kwang-seok ever since his death. After his death, his daughter died in 2007 and her mother (Kim Kwang-seok's wife) didn't inform anyone of her death.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nA tribute concert has been held annually by singers across musical genres including rock and roll and hip-hop, and his albums sell steadily, marking 5 million copies as of January 2007. On 6 January 2008, the 12th anniversary of his death, a memorial relief sculpture was unveiled at the concert hall where he held thousands of concerts, drawing many fans who memorialized him. In November 2010, more than twenty artists, designers, and sculptors collectively made a mural to the memory of Kim Kwang-seok in the city of Daegu, where he spent his early years. Critics and reporters have analyzed his legacy and the persistent fervor for his music in numerous articles and books such as \u2018Biography of Kim Kwang-seok, an unsent message\u2019 by Lee Yoon-ock and \u2018The 100 masterpiece albums of Korean Popular Music\u2019 by Park Joon-hum et al. From the perspective of history of Korean popular music, he is the direct descendant as well as the successor of Korean topical folk rock, which was initiated by Han Dae-su and flourished with songs of Kim Min-ki, Jung Tae-choon, and arguably Cho Dong-jin in early 1970s under the rule of the dictator Park Chung Hee, who was in power from 1961 to 1979. However, even though Kim Kwang-seok's music was clearly rooted in social issues in his early years of his career, he also empathized with the sorrow and frustration of individuals, which had been downplayed in the struggle for democracy. Around the late 80s and early 90s, with the improvement of democracy in Korean society,the young generations began to turn their attention from collectivism and community to individualism and experiences of their contemporaries. Kim Kwang-seok illustrated the lives of people with loving eyes, but stayed composed and measured. Lee Joo-yup, a music critic, argues that his songs portrayed individuals who are constantly wavering on the border of pessimism and optimism, but sublimated the self-consciousness that never gives up the strain of facing reality. \u201cStanding in the midst of the darkness of night, I can\u2019t see even an inch ahead, where I am going, where I am standing, uselessly looking around, drifting over the river of life like a floating weed, I may perish at this unknown river bank, stand up, stand up, give it a try, stand up, stand up, like the sprouts in Spring\u201d (Stand up).\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\n\n\n=== Posthumous releases ===\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe German Hip Hop group Die Orsons made a song called Kim Kwang-seok. The song deals with Kim's music and suicide.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKim Kwang-seok Fan Cafe (in Korean)",

        "wiki": "Daegu (Korean: [t\u025b\u0261u]; \ub300\uad6c, \u5927\u90b1, literally 'large hill'\ub300\uad6c\uad11\uc5ed\uc2dc), formerly spelled Taegu and officially known as the Daegu Metropolitan City, is a city in South Korea, the fourth-largest after Seoul, Busan, and Incheon and the third-largest metropolitan area in the nation with over 2.5 million residents. Also, it is the second largest city in the Yeongnam region after Busan. However, it is the fourth city in terms of population after Seoul, Busan and Incheon. It was overtaken by Incheon in the 2000s, but still it is said to be the third city according to the \"Act on the Establishment of Daegu City and Incheon City\" (Act No. 3424 and April 13, 1981). Daegu and surrounding North Gyeongsang Province are often referred to as Daegu-Gyeongbuk, with a total population over 5 million. \nDaegu is located in south-eastern Korea about 80 km (50 mi) from the seacoast, near the Geumho River and its mainstream, Nakdong River in Gyeongsang-do. The Daegu basin is the central plain of the Yeongnam region. In ancient times, the Daegu area was part of the proto-kingdom Jinhan. Subsequently, Daegu came under the control of the Silla Kingdom, which unified the Korean Peninsula. During the Joseon Dynasty period, the city was the capital of Gyeongsang-do, one of the traditional eight provinces of the country.\nDaegu was an economic motor of Korea during the 1960s\u20131980s period and was especially known for its electronics industry. The humid subtropical climate of Daegu is ideal for producing high-quality apples, thus the nickname, \"Apple City\". Daegu is also known as \"Textile City\". Textiles used to be the pillar industry of the city. With the establishment of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone, Daegu is currently focusing on fostering fashion and high-tech industries.\nDaegu was the host city of the 22nd World Energy Congress, the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, and the 2003 Summer Universiade. It also hosted four matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory and early history ===\nArchaeological investigations in the Greater Daegu area have revealed a large number of settlements and burials of the prehistoric Mumun Pottery Period (around 1500\u2013300 BC). In fact, some of the earliest evidence of Mumun settlement in Gyeongsangdo have been excavated from Siji-dong and Seobyeon-dong. Dongcheon-dong is one of the substantial Mumun agricultural villages that have been excavated. The Dongcheon-dong site dates back to the Middle Mumun (around 850\u2013550 BC) and contains the remains of many prehistoric pit-houses and agricultural fields. Megalithic burials (dolmens) have also been found in large numbers in Daegu.\nAncient historical texts indicate that during the Proto\u2013Three Kingdoms (Mahan, Jinhan, and Byeonhan) period, Daegu was the site of a chiefdom or walled-town polity known from that time, according to historical records, as Dalgubeol. It was absorbed into the kingdom of Silla no later than the fifth century. The vestiges of the wall can be seen, and relics have been excavated in the current Dalseong Park.\n\n\n=== Silla ===\nSilla succeeded in unifying the Korean peninsula by defeating the other kingdoms of Baekje and Koguryo in the late seventh century, partly due to assistance from China's Tang Dynasty. Shortly thereafter, in 689, Silla's King Sinmun considered moving the capital from Gyeongju to Daegu, but was unable to do so.  This initiative is known only through a single line in the Samguk Sagi, a most valued historical record of ancient Korea by Koryeo Dynasty historian Kim Bu-sik, but it is presumed to indicate both an attempt by the Silla king to reinforce royal authority and the entrenched resistance of the Gyeongju political elites that was the likely cause of the move's failure. The city was given its current name in 757.\nIn the late 1990s, archaeologists excavated a large-scale fortified Silla site in Dongcheon-dong, Buk-gu. The site at Locality 2 consists of the remains of 39 raised-floor buildings enclosed by a formidable ditch-and-palisade system. The excavators hypothesize that the fortified site was a permanent military encampment or barracks. Archaeologists also uncovered a large Silla village dating to the sixth to seventh centuries AD at Siji-dong.\n\n\n=== Later Three Kingdoms and Goryeo ===\nDuring the Later Three Kingdoms period, 892\u2013936, Daegu was initially aligned with Hubaekje. In 927, northern Daegu was the site of the Battle of Gong Mountain between the forces of Goryeo under Wang Geon and those of Hubaekje under Gyeon Hwon. In this battle, the forces of Goryeo were crushed and Wang Geon himself was saved only by the heroic deed of his general Shin Sung-gyeom. However,  the atrocities of the Hubaekje forces at this time apparently changed local sympathizers to favor Wang Geon, who later became the king of Goryeo.\nNumerous place names and local legends in the area still bear witness to the historic battle of 927. Among these are \"Ansim\", which literally means \"peace of mind\", said to be the first place where Wang Geon dared to stop after escaping the battle, and \"Banwol\", or half-moon, where he is said to have stopped and admired the moon before returning to Goryeo. A statue commemorating the battle now stands in northern Daegu, as does a memorial to Sin Sunggyeom.\nIn the Goryeo period, the first edition of the Tripitaka Koreana was stored in Daegu, at the temple of Buinsa.  However, this edition was destroyed when the temple was sacked in 1254, during the Mongol invasions of Korea.\n\n\n=== Joseon ===\n\nDaegu served as an important transportation center during the Joseon Dynasty. She stands in the mid part of the Great Yeongnam Road which ran between Seoul and Busan. It lay at the junction of this arterial road and the roads to Gyeongju and Jinju.\nIn 1601, Daegu became the administrative capital of the Gyeongsang-do, which is current Daegu, Busan, Ulsan, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and Gyeongsangnam-do. At about that time, the city began to grow into a major city. The status continued for nearly 300 years, and the city has been transformed as the capital of Gyeongsangbuk-do since Gyeongsang-do was divided into two provinces, Gyeongsangbuk-do (northern Gyeongsang-province) and Gyeongsangnam-do (southern one) in 1896.\nDaegu's first regular markets were established during the late Joseon period. The most famous of these is the Yangnyeongsi herbal medicine market. This became a center of herbal trade in Joseon, and even attracted buyers from neighboring countries. Traders from Japan, who were not permitted to leave the Nakdong River valley, hired messengers to visit the market on their behalf. Seomun Market, which stood at the city's west gate at that time, was one of the top-three markets in the Joseon period.\n\n\n=== Korean Empire and colonial rule ===\nThe Korean hermit kingdom finally opened itself to the outside world in the late 19th century. In 1895, Daegu became the site of one of the country's first modern post offices, as a part of the 'Gab-o' reforms introduced in the aftermath of the Sino-Japanese war.Beginning in the late 1890s, increasing numbers of foreign merchants and workers started to visit Daegu, which emerged as a modern transportation center of the newly constructed Gyeongbu Line main railroad connecting Seoul and Busan.\nIn 1905, the old fortress wall was forcibly destroyed. The wall still survives only in the street names such as the streets Dongseongno and Bukseongno, \"east fortress street\" and \"north fortress street\", which now run where the wall once stood.\nIndependence movements against imperial aggressions were outstanding in Daegu. These began as early as 1898, when a branch of the Independence Club was opened in the town.  As the demise of the Korean Empire approached in 1907, local citizens led by Seo Sang-don organized the National Debt Repayment Movement. The movement spread nationwide, although it fell short of repaying the national debt through individual donations. Freedom fighting continued after the 1910 annexation, notably during the March 1st movement of 1919. At that time, four major demonstrations took place in Daegu, involving an estimated 23,000 peace-loving citizens.\n\n\n=== After 1945 ===\nIn 1946, the Daegu October Incident took place, one of the most serious social disorders since the foundation of the Republic of Korea. An operation by the Korean national police to take control of rioters on October 1 resulted in the death of three student demonstrators and injuries to many others, sparking a massive counter-attack, killing as many as 38 policemen. It was also the site of major demonstrations on February 28, 1960, prior to the presidential election of that year.Daegu and all of North Gyeongsang province had heavy guerrilla activities in the late 1940s, as thousands of refugees shied away from the fighting in Jeolla province and sought shelters in Daegu.  In November 1948, a unit in Daegu joined the mutiny which had begun in Yeosu the previous month.During the Korean War, heavy fighting occurred nearby along the Nakdong River. Daegu sat inside the Pusan Perimeter, however, so remained in South Korean hands throughout the war. As in many other areas during the Korean War, political killings of dissenters were widespread. A large series of engagements was fought around the city to prevent North Korean troops from crossing the Nakdong, the Battle of Taegu.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the city underwent explosive growth, and the population has increased more than tenfold since the end of the Korean War. The city was politically favored during the 18-year-long rule of Park Chung-hee, when it and the surrounding area served as his political base. Daegu champions conservative political ideas and movements today and is a political base for the Saenuri Party.\nIn the 1980s, Daegu separated from Gyeongsangbuk-do and became a separately administered provincial-level directly governed city (Jikhalsi), and was redesignated as a metropolitan city (Gwangyeoksi) in 1995. Today, Daegu is the third-largest metropolitan area in Korea with respect to both population and commerce.\nIn February 2020, Daegu became known for the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nTwo local governments are in the city, the Daegu Metropolitan Government in Jung District and Gyeongbuk Provincial Government in Buk District. The provincial government will be relocated to Andong in its proper province, Gyeongbuk. The mayor and heads of city's eight districts are directly elected by the citizens every four years. The city council has 29 members which consist of 26 from the same number of electoral districts and three proportional representations. They are also directly elected every four years. Most of them are the members of the Liberty Korea Party, the main conservative political party in South Korea. Daegu is a stronghold for the party and has produced two Presidents of the Republic of Korea thus far: Roh Tae-woo and Park Geun-hye. As the capital of the Korean conservatives, the city has wielded strong political influence in elections.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nDaegu is divided into 7 districts (Gu) and 1 county (Gun)\n\nJung District (\uc911\uad6c, \u4e2d\u5340) \u2013 means the central district.\nDong District (\ub3d9\uad6c, \u6771\u5340) \u2013 means the east district.\nSeo District (\uc11c\uad6c, \u897f\u5340) \u2013 means the west district.\nNam District (\ub0a8\uad6c, \u5357\u5340) \u2013 means the south district.\nBuk District (\ubd81\uad6c, \u5317\u5340) \u2013 means the north district.\nSuseong District (\uc218\uc131\uad6c, \u58fd\u57ce\u5340)\nDalseo District (\ub2ec\uc11c\uad6c, \u9054\u897f\u5340)\nDalseong County (\ub2ec\uc131\uad70, \u9054\u57ce\u90e1)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nDaegu sits in a basin surrounded by low mountains. Palgongsan to the north, Biseulsan to the south, Waryongsan to the west, and a series of smaller hills in the east. The Geumho River flows along the northern and eastern edges of the city, emptying in the Nakdong River west of the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDaegu has a cooler version of a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa). In Holdridge climate classification, Daegu has a warm temperate moist forest climate. The mountains that comprise the basin trap hot and humid air. Similarly, in winter, cold air lies in the basin. The area receives little precipitation except during the rainy season of summer, and is sunny throughout much of the year. Data gathered since 1961 indicates that the mean temperature for January, the coldest month in Daegu, is 0.6 \u00b0C (33 \u00b0F) and that for August, the warmest month, is 26.4 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F). The City's lowest record temperature was \u221220.2 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F), and the City's highest record temperature was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F). The 40 degrees Celsius recorded in 1942 is also the highest temperature record in South Korea since the observation. This summer temperature has led to the emergence of a new term called Dae-Prika (Daegu+Africa) starting with the Internet community, and has recently been used in the media, broadcasting, etc. \n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nDaegu is a manufacturing industry city. The major industries are textiles, metals and machinery. In the year 2010, Daegu had a regional GDP of $45,387 million with 7.2% real GDP growth rate. The GDP per capita though is well below Korea national average. Many companies such as Daegu Bank, Korea Delphi, Hwasung corp., and TaeguTec are situated in this city, and Samsung and Kolon were founded here. Numerous factories are located in the industrial complexes situated in the west and north sides of the city including the Seongseo Industrial Complex, West Daegu Industrial Complex and the Daegu Dyeing Industrial Complex.\nThe city is the economic and industrial core of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk region, one of the major industrial areas in Korea. It accounted for as much as 94 percent of Korea's trade surplus in 2006. The electronics industries in Gumi and the steel industries in Pohang provided great services to that surplus. World-leading manufacturing facilities for Anycall (Samsung Mobile) and POSCO's main factories are located near the city. Daegu and its neighbouring cities were designated for the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone by the central government in 2008. It is specialized companies like Winitech software company in knowledge-based service and manufacturing industries.\nHistorically, Daegu has been the commercial center of the southern part of the Korean Peninsula with Seoul in the center and Pyongyang in the north (currently North Korea), because of its advantageous location. Some of the large, traditional markets like Seomun Market are still flourishing in the city.\nAdditionally, Daegu was considered the third major economic city in Korea, after Seoul and Busan. However, due to the decline of the textile industry, which is the heart of Daegu's economy, the overall economic growth of the city has also fallen.\nAlso, the city is the warmest region in South Korea due to the humid subtropical climate. This climate condition provides the region with high quality apples and oriental melons. The fruit industry is a crucial support for the local economy. Due to the stagnant economy, Daegu's population began to decrease after 2003. Recently, the local government has begun focusing on working towards economic revival and concentrating on improving the city's fashion industry.\n\n\n=== Fashion industry ===\nBeginning in the late 1990s, Daegu has been actively making efforts to promote its fashion industry based on its textile and clothing manufacturing industries under the 'Daegu: Fashion City'. The city opens many exhibitions related to the fashion and textile industries including the Daegu Fashion Fair and Preview in Daegu annually or semi-annually, and invites national institutes. A large new town specializing in the textile-fashion industries is currently under construction in Bongmu-dong, northeastern Daegu. The district, officially named Esiapolis, takes aim at the fashion hub of East Asia. Textile complexes, textile-fashion institutions, an international school, fashion malls as well as residential areas plan to be developed in the district.\n\n\n== Culture and sightseeing ==\n\nGenerally Daegu is known as a conservative city. As well as being the largest inland city in the country beside Seoul it has become one of the major metropolitan areas in the nation. Traditionally, Buddhism has been strong; today there are still many temples. Confucianism is also popular in Daegu, with a large academy based in the city. Neon cross-topped spires of Christian churches can also be seen in the city.\n\n\n=== Sights ===\nThe most well-known sight of the city is the stone Buddha called Gatbawi on the top of Gwanbong, Palgongsan. It is famous for its stone gat (Korean traditional hat). People from all over the country visit the place, because they believe that the Buddha will grant one's single desire. Administratively, the site itself is located in the neighboring city, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk.\n\nOn the outskirts of the city, mountains keep many traditional temples such as Donghwasa, Pagyesa, and Buinsa. Donghwasa is a Buddhist temple that was built by Priest Geukdal-hwasang in 493, and many artifacts of the period are found around the temple. The International Tourist Zen Meditation Center is Korea's only Zen-themed center. Some lecture halls or memorial halls such as Dodong-seowon (\ub3c4\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9053\u6771\u66f8\u9662) and Nokdong-seowon (\ub179\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9e7f\u6d1e\u66f8\u9662) are also located in the suburbs.\nOld villages have been preserved, such as the Otgol village (Gyeongju Choi clan's original residence area) and the Inheung village (Nampyeong Mun's). In the urban area, the Joseon Dynasty's administrative or educational buildings including Gyeongsang-gamyeong (\uacbd\uc0c1\uac10\uc601, \u6176\u5c19\u76e3\u71df) and Daegu-hyanggyo (\ub300\uad6c\ud5a5\uad50, \u5927\u90b1\u9115\u6821) also remain. The main gateway of the city in that period called Yeongnam-jeilmun (\uc601\ub0a8\uc81c\uc77c\ubb38, \u5dba\u5357\u7b2c\u4e00\u9580, meaning the first gateway in Yeongnam), has been restored in Mangudang Park. Western style modern architecture like Gyesan Cathedral and the old building of Jeil Church are preserved across the urban area. Gyesan Cathedral is the third oldest gothic church building in Korea and the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Daegu which is one of three archdioceses in South Korea. Several buildings, in the present Keisung Academy and the KNU middle/high school, are famous too.\nYangnyeongsi (\uc57d\ub839\uc2dc, \u85e5\u4ee4\u5e02) in Namseongno (often called Yakjeon-golmok) is the oldest market for Korean medicinal herbs in the country with a history of 350 years. Bongsan-dong which has some art galleries and studios is being developed as the artistic center of the city since the 1990s.\nNearby tourist attractions include Haeinsa\u2014a Buddhist temple that houses the Tripitaka Koreana (a woodblock edition of the Tripitaka and one of the world's oldest extant complete collections of the Buddhist scriptures). Haeinsa is located in Gayasan National Park of Hapcheon, Gyeongnam. The historic city of Gyeongju, Gyeongbuk, the capital of the ancient kingdom of Silla is located east of Daegu.\n\n\n=== Mountains and parks ===\n\nMt. Palgong, Mt. Biseul, and Mt. Ap are the representative mountains in Daegu. Apsan, just in the southern part of the city, is the closest mountain from the urban area among them. It has many trails, Buddhist temples, a Korean War museum, and a gondola ride to the peak. Additionally, Waryongsan, Hamjisan, and Yongjibong are located in the city. These serve as neighborhood parks to the citizens. Mt. Palgong has a cable car to the summit. There are also hiking trails in the direction of the Donghwasa Temple and Sutaegol Valley.\nIn the urban area, several small mountains and hills play the same role. Dalseong Park, which sits inside a 1,500-year-old earth fortress, is a historic place of the city. It contains the city's only zoo and some monuments as well as the wall. Duryu Park or Duryusan is a large forest in the middle of the urban area. It has Daegu Tower, Woobang Land, Kolon Bandstand, Duryu Stadium, and many sports facilities. Daegu Tower, also called Woobang Tower or Duryu Tower, is the tallest contemporary structure (202 m) and a symbol of the city. Its observatory commands good views of the surroundings. Woobang Land is the largest amusement park out of the capital area. Many small gardens lie in the heart of the city, such as the National Debt Repayment Movement Memorial Park (Gukchae Bosang Park) and 2\u00b728 Park. The former park includes Dalgubeol-daejong (\ub2ec\uad6c\ubc8c\ub300\uc885, \u9054\u53e5\u4f10\u5927\u9418), which means the Dalgubeol grand bell. The bell is struck every week and year. There is also a botanical garden with a variety of plants and flowers.\n\n\n=== Downtown and shopping ===\nDongseongno (\ub3d9\uc131\ub85c, \u6771\u57ce\u8def) is the downtown of Daegu lying from the Daegu Station to Jung-ang pachulso (central police station) near the Banwoldang subway station in the center of the city Jung-gu. It has the Jung-angno subway station as the nearest station from its heart. Like its name meaning the street in the east fortress, the eastern part of Daegu-eupseong (\ub300\uad6c\uc74d\uc131, \u5927\u90b1\u9091\u57ce, means the Daegu-Principality Fortress) was situated along this street. The fortress, however, had been demolished in the early 20th century. Although Daegu is the nation's third or fourth largest city, the Dongseongno area form the largest and the broadest downtown area in the whole country except the capital city, Seoul.  In most cases, famous brands open their branch shop first here out of the Greater Seoul area.\n\nSub-downtowns in the city have its own commercial powers and colors. The area around the Seongseo Industrial Complex subway station in Dalseo-gu is a concentration of many amusement spots, and young people easily can be seen around Kyungpook National University in Buk-gu. Deuran-gil (means the street inside the field) in Suseong-gu is known for many restaurants.\nThe city has a number of department stores. Many of these belong to national or multinational chains, but the local Daegu Department Store also operates two branches, while another local chain, Donga Department Store operates four in the city proper. The six department stores among them gather at the downtown. The traditional markets such as Seomun Market and Chilseong Market sell all sorts of goods.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nMany traditional ceremonies and festivals in agrarian society disappeared in the process of modernization. A Confucian ritual ceremony called Seokjeondaeje is held at Daegu-hyanggyo every spring and autumn. The Yangnyeongsi herb medical festival and Otgol village festival are the contemporary festivals about traditional culture.\nLately in the city, enthusiasm about performing arts is growing and the local government is trying to meet its demand. Daegu International Opera Festival (DIOF) in October since 2003, Daegu International Musical Festival (DIMF), and Daegu International Bodypainting Festival (DIBF) are three of the most famous festivals on each field in Korea, although those have short histories.\nVarious festivals in various themes like the Colorful Daegu Festival, Dongseongno festival, Palgongsan maple festival, Biseulsan azalea festival, Korea in Motion Daegu, and so on, are held by the city, each ward, or the specific groups, all through the year.\nOn August 25 through August 31, 2008, Daegu hosted the first ever Asian Bodypainting Festival, a sister event of the World Bodypainting Festival in Seeboden, Austria.\nEach year the city is home to the Daegu International Jazz Festival: http://www.dijf.or.kr/\nEvery May the \"Colorful Daegu Festival\" offers performances and art programs including the Colorful Parade. In July, the Daegu Chimac Festival takes place at Duryu Park in Dalseo-gu, Daegu. The term \"chimac\" is a portmanteau of chicken and maekju (meaning \"beer\"). There were over 880,000 visitors in 2015, and one million visitors during the festival in 2016.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nDaegu Art Museum\nDaegu National Museum \u2013 A notable national museum collecting relics excavated in and around Daegu\nDaegu Bangjja Yugi (Korean Bronzeware) Museum\nHengso Museum of Keimyung University\nKorea Video Museum\nKyungpook National University Museum\nMuseum for Daegu National University of Education\nMuseum of Natural Dye Arts\n\n\n=== Theaters ===\nDaegu Opera House \u2013 The first theater in Korea only for performing opera\nSuseong Artpia\nKeimyung Art Center \u2013 One of the largest scale theaters in the city.\nDaegu Culture and Arts Center\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nOn March 27, 2007, the city was selected to host the 2011 World Championships in Athletics. Daegu competed with cities such as Moscow, Russia and Brisbane, Australia to earn the votes of the IAAF Council. The event was the fourth IAAF World Championships in Athletics to be held outside Europe, and the first games in mainland Asia. It was also the third worldwide sports event held in Korea after the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul and 2002 FIFA World Cup in Korea and Japan. Daegu also hosted three matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, and the 2003 Summer Universiade. The city hosts the Colorful Daegu Pre-Championships Meeting every year since 2005.\n\nDaegu Stadium is the second largest sports complex in South Korea with a seating capacity of 66,422. Daegu Civic Stadium hosted some football matches at the 1988 Summer Olympics.\nThe Daegu Marathon is held here every year in April. The race begins and ends at the Daegu Stadium.\n\n\n==== Sports teams ====\n\n\n===== The Samsung Lions =====\nThe Samsung Lions (Hangul: \uc0bc\uc131 \ub77c\uc774\uc628\uc988) are a South Korean professional baseball team founded in 1982.

They were also the winners of the Korean FA Cup in 2018, having previously been semi-finalists in 2008.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nThere are three terrestrial TV broadcasting stations in the city: KBS Daegu Broadcast Station, Daegu MBC, and TBC. These are affiliated companies of central broadcasting stations in Seoul just like other local broadcasting companies in South Korea. TBC (Taegu Broadcasting Corporation) depends on SBS. They cover to Gyeongsangbuk-do out of the city. Each television broadcasting company has its own radio station as well.\n\n\n=== International Daegu ===\nDaegu is largely a homogeneous community that includes few non-Koreans. However, a number of immigrants from South and Southeast Asia work in automotive-parts factories on the city's west side. In addition, there is a small group of English-speaking Westerners working in English schools and university programs. The American military bases are also home to several hundred Americans. Recently Chinese students have begun studying Korean at universities in Daegu, and there is an increasing number of graduate and post-graduate students from other Asian countries. As elsewhere in Korea, Korean food overwhelmingly dominates; Chinese, Japanese and Western food forms the bulk of non-Korean food but recently Indian and Russian foods have become available.\nDaegu hosts three American military bases, Camp Henry, Camp George which houses Daegu American School, and Camp Walker. Camp Walker houses Daegu High School for high school children, while Camp George hold the school for elementary and middle school (both of which are primarily for children of military personnel and US Military civilian employees). Camp George also houses most of the married [Enlisted] ranked soldiers. Camp Henry and Camp Walker serve as the primary place of work for all the military personnel. Camp Walker serves as the home to enlisted Sergeants Major and Officer ranked soldiers, Major and up. Although non-military families can enroll their children at the school, most either home-school their children or send them to a small Christian private school which teaches about 25 children near the central business district of Daegu.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\nAccording to the census of 2015, of the people of Daegu 50.5% follow Buddhism and 17.9% follow Christianity (12% Protestantism and 5.8% Catholicism). 34.7% of the population is mostly not religious or follow other indigenous religions.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nAs of 2019, Daegu has 229 elementary schools, 125 middle schools including the Dong-Pyeong Middle School, and 93 high schools. There are two specialized public high schools which are Daegu Science High School and Taegu Foreign Language High School, and some other high schools such as Keisung Academy, Gyeongsin High School and Daeryun High School have good grades for university admission.

        "wiki": "Daegu (Korean: [t\u025b\u0261u]; \ub300\uad6c, \u5927\u90b1, literally 'large hill'\ub300\uad6c\uad11\uc5ed\uc2dc), formerly spelled Taegu and officially known as the Daegu Metropolitan City, is a city in South Korea, the fourth-largest after Seoul, Busan, and Incheon and the third-largest metropolitan area in the nation with over 2.5 million residents. Also, it is the second largest city in the Yeongnam region after Busan. However, it is the fourth city in terms of population after Seoul, Busan and Incheon. It was overtaken by Incheon in the 2000s, but still it is said to be the third city according to the \"Act on the Establishment of Daegu City and Incheon City\" (Act No. 3424 and April 13, 1981). Daegu and surrounding North Gyeongsang Province are often referred to as Daegu-Gyeongbuk, with a total population over 5 million. \nDaegu is located in south-eastern Korea about 80 km (50 mi) from the seacoast, near the Geumho River and its mainstream, Nakdong River in Gyeongsang-do. The Daegu basin is the central plain of the Yeongnam region. In ancient times, the Daegu area was part of the proto-kingdom Jinhan. Subsequently, Daegu came under the control of the Silla Kingdom, which unified the Korean Peninsula. During the Joseon Dynasty period, the city was the capital of Gyeongsang-do, one of the traditional eight provinces of the country.\nDaegu was an economic motor of Korea during the 1960s\u20131980s period and was especially known for its electronics industry. The humid subtropical climate of Daegu is ideal for producing high-quality apples, thus the nickname, \"Apple City\". Daegu is also known as \"Textile City\". Textiles used to be the pillar industry of the city. With the establishment of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone, Daegu is currently focusing on fostering fashion and high-tech industries.\nDaegu was the host city of the 22nd World Energy Congress, the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, and the 2003 Summer Universiade. It also hosted four matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory and early history ===\nArchaeological investigations in the Greater Daegu area have revealed a large number of settlements and burials of the prehistoric Mumun Pottery Period (around 1500\u2013300 BC). In fact, some of the earliest evidence of Mumun settlement in Gyeongsangdo have been excavated from Siji-dong and Seobyeon-dong. Dongcheon-dong is one of the substantial Mumun agricultural villages that have been excavated. The Dongcheon-dong site dates back to the Middle Mumun (around 850\u2013550 BC) and contains the remains of many prehistoric pit-houses and agricultural fields. Megalithic burials (dolmens) have also been found in large numbers in Daegu.\nAncient historical texts indicate that during the Proto\u2013Three Kingdoms (Mahan, Jinhan, and Byeonhan) period, Daegu was the site of a chiefdom or walled-town polity known from that time, according to historical records, as Dalgubeol. It was absorbed into the kingdom of Silla no later than the fifth century. The vestiges of the wall can be seen, and relics have been excavated in the current Dalseong Park.\n\n\n=== Silla ===\nSilla succeeded in unifying the Korean peninsula by defeating the other kingdoms of Baekje and Koguryo in the late seventh century, partly due to assistance from China's Tang Dynasty. Shortly thereafter, in 689, Silla's King Sinmun considered moving the capital from Gyeongju to Daegu, but was unable to do so.  This initiative is known only through a single line in the Samguk Sagi, a most valued historical record of ancient Korea by Koryeo Dynasty historian Kim Bu-sik, but it is presumed to indicate both an attempt by the Silla king to reinforce royal authority and the entrenched resistance of the Gyeongju political elites that was the likely cause of the move's failure. The city was given its current name in 757.\nIn the late 1990s, archaeologists excavated a large-scale fortified Silla site in Dongcheon-dong, Buk-gu. The site at Locality 2 consists of the remains of 39 raised-floor buildings enclosed by a formidable ditch-and-palisade system. The excavators hypothesize that the fortified site was a permanent military encampment or barracks. Archaeologists also uncovered a large Silla village dating to the sixth to seventh centuries AD at Siji-dong.\n\n\n=== Later Three Kingdoms and Goryeo ===\nDuring the Later Three Kingdoms period, 892\u2013936, Daegu was initially aligned with Hubaekje. In 927, northern Daegu was the site of the Battle of Gong Mountain between the forces of Goryeo under Wang Geon and those of Hubaekje under Gyeon Hwon. In this battle, the forces of Goryeo were crushed and Wang Geon himself was saved only by the heroic deed of his general Shin Sung-gyeom. However,  the atrocities of the Hubaekje forces at this time apparently changed local sympathizers to favor Wang Geon, who later became the king of Goryeo.\nNumerous place names and local legends in the area still bear witness to the historic battle of 927. Among these are \"Ansim\", which literally means \"peace of mind\", said to be the first place where Wang Geon dared to stop after escaping the battle, and \"Banwol\", or half-moon, where he is said to have stopped and admired the moon before returning to Goryeo. A statue commemorating the battle now stands in northern Daegu, as does a memorial to Sin Sunggyeom.\nIn the Goryeo period, the first edition of the Tripitaka Koreana was stored in Daegu, at the temple of Buinsa.  However, this edition was destroyed when the temple was sacked in 1254, during the Mongol invasions of Korea.\n\n\n=== Joseon ===\n\nDaegu served as an important transportation center during the Joseon Dynasty. She stands in the mid part of the Great Yeongnam Road which ran between Seoul and Busan. It lay at the junction of this arterial road and the roads to Gyeongju and Jinju.\nIn 1601, Daegu became the administrative capital of the Gyeongsang-do, which is current Daegu, Busan, Ulsan, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and Gyeongsangnam-do. At about that time, the city began to grow into a major city. The status continued for nearly 300 years, and the city has been transformed as the capital of Gyeongsangbuk-do since Gyeongsang-do was divided into two provinces, Gyeongsangbuk-do (northern Gyeongsang-province) and Gyeongsangnam-do (southern one) in 1896.\nDaegu's first regular markets were established during the late Joseon period. The most famous of these is the Yangnyeongsi herbal medicine market. This became a center of herbal trade in Joseon, and even attracted buyers from neighboring countries. Traders from Japan, who were not permitted to leave the Nakdong River valley, hired messengers to visit the market on their behalf. Seomun Market, which stood at the city's west gate at that time, was one of the top-three markets in the Joseon period.\n\n\n=== Korean Empire and colonial rule ===\nThe Korean hermit kingdom finally opened itself to the outside world in the late 19th century. In 1895, Daegu became the site of one of the country's first modern post offices, as a part of the 'Gab-o' reforms introduced in the aftermath of the Sino-Japanese war.Beginning in the late 1890s, increasing numbers of foreign merchants and workers started to visit Daegu, which emerged as a modern transportation center of the newly constructed Gyeongbu Line main railroad connecting Seoul and Busan.\nIn 1905, the old fortress wall was forcibly destroyed. The wall still survives only in the street names such as the streets Dongseongno and Bukseongno, \"east fortress street\" and \"north fortress street\", which now run where the wall once stood.\nIndependence movements against imperial aggressions were outstanding in Daegu. These began as early as 1898, when a branch of the Independence Club was opened in the town.  As the demise of the Korean Empire approached in 1907, local citizens led by Seo Sang-don organized the National Debt Repayment Movement. The movement spread nationwide, although it fell short of repaying the national debt through individual donations. Freedom fighting continued after the 1910 annexation, notably during the March 1st movement of 1919. At that time, four major demonstrations took place in Daegu, involving an estimated 23,000 peace-loving citizens.\n\n\n=== After 1945 ===\nIn 1946, the Daegu October Incident took place, one of the most serious social disorders since the foundation of the Republic of Korea. An operation by the Korean national police to take control of rioters on October 1 resulted in the death of three student demonstrators and injuries to many others, sparking a massive counter-attack, killing as many as 38 policemen. It was also the site of major demonstrations on February 28, 1960, prior to the presidential election of that year.Daegu and all of North Gyeongsang province had heavy guerrilla activities in the late 1940s, as thousands of refugees shied away from the fighting in Jeolla province and sought shelters in Daegu.  In November 1948, a unit in Daegu joined the mutiny which had begun in Yeosu the previous month.During the Korean War, heavy fighting occurred nearby along the Nakdong River. Daegu sat inside the Pusan Perimeter, however, so remained in South Korean hands throughout the war. As in many other areas during the Korean War, political killings of dissenters were widespread. A large series of engagements was fought around the city to prevent North Korean troops from crossing the Nakdong, the Battle of Taegu.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the city underwent explosive growth, and the population has increased more than tenfold since the end of the Korean War. The city was politically favored during the 18-year-long rule of Park Chung-hee, when it and the surrounding area served as his political base. Daegu champions conservative political ideas and movements today and is a political base for the Saenuri Party.\nIn the 1980s, Daegu separated from Gyeongsangbuk-do and became a separately administered provincial-level directly governed city (Jikhalsi), and was redesignated as a metropolitan city (Gwangyeoksi) in 1995. Today, Daegu is the third-largest metropolitan area in Korea with respect to both population and commerce.\nIn February 2020, Daegu became known for the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nTwo local governments are in the city, the Daegu Metropolitan Government in Jung District and Gyeongbuk Provincial Government in Buk District. The provincial government will be relocated to Andong in its proper province, Gyeongbuk. The mayor and heads of city's eight districts are directly elected by the citizens every four years. The city council has 29 members which consist of 26 from the same number of electoral districts and three proportional representations. They are also directly elected every four years. Most of them are the members of the Liberty Korea Party, the main conservative political party in South Korea. Daegu is a stronghold for the party and has produced two Presidents of the Republic of Korea thus far: Roh Tae-woo and Park Geun-hye. As the capital of the Korean conservatives, the city has wielded strong political influence in elections.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nDaegu is divided into 7 districts (Gu) and 1 county (Gun)\n\nJung District (\uc911\uad6c, \u4e2d\u5340) \u2013 means the central district.\nDong District (\ub3d9\uad6c, \u6771\u5340) \u2013 means the east district.\nSeo District (\uc11c\uad6c, \u897f\u5340) \u2013 means the west district.\nNam District (\ub0a8\uad6c, \u5357\u5340) \u2013 means the south district.\nBuk District (\ubd81\uad6c, \u5317\u5340) \u2013 means the north district.\nSuseong District (\uc218\uc131\uad6c, \u58fd\u57ce\u5340)\nDalseo District (\ub2ec\uc11c\uad6c, \u9054\u897f\u5340)\nDalseong County (\ub2ec\uc131\uad70, \u9054\u57ce\u90e1)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nDaegu sits in a basin surrounded by low mountains. Palgongsan to the north, Biseulsan to the south, Waryongsan to the west, and a series of smaller hills in the east. The Geumho River flows along the northern and eastern edges of the city, emptying in the Nakdong River west of the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDaegu has a cooler version of a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa). In Holdridge climate classification, Daegu has a warm temperate moist forest climate. The mountains that comprise the basin trap hot and humid air. Similarly, in winter, cold air lies in the basin. The area receives little precipitation except during the rainy season of summer, and is sunny throughout much of the year. Data gathered since 1961 indicates that the mean temperature for January, the coldest month in Daegu, is 0.6 \u00b0C (33 \u00b0F) and that for August, the warmest month, is 26.4 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F). The City's lowest record temperature was \u221220.2 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F), and the City's highest record temperature was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F). The 40 degrees Celsius recorded in 1942 is also the highest temperature record in South Korea since the observation. This summer temperature has led to the emergence of a new term called Dae-Prika (Daegu+Africa) starting with the Internet community, and has recently been used in the media, broadcasting, etc. \n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nDaegu is a manufacturing industry city. The major industries are textiles, metals and machinery. In the year 2010, Daegu had a regional GDP of $45,387 million with 7.2% real GDP growth rate. The GDP per capita though is well below Korea national average. Many companies such as Daegu Bank, Korea Delphi, Hwasung corp., and TaeguTec are situated in this city, and Samsung and Kolon were founded here. Numerous factories are located in the industrial complexes situated in the west and north sides of the city including the Seongseo Industrial Complex, West Daegu Industrial Complex and the Daegu Dyeing Industrial Complex.\nThe city is the economic and industrial core of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk region, one of the major industrial areas in Korea. It accounted for as much as 94 percent of Korea's trade surplus in 2006. The electronics industries in Gumi and the steel industries in Pohang provided great services to that surplus. World-leading manufacturing facilities for Anycall (Samsung Mobile) and POSCO's main factories are located near the city. Daegu and its neighbouring cities were designated for the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone by the central government in 2008. It is specialized companies like Winitech software company in knowledge-based service and manufacturing industries.\nHistorically, Daegu has been the commercial center of the southern part of the Korean Peninsula with Seoul in the center and Pyongyang in the north (currently North Korea), because of its advantageous location. Some of the large, traditional markets like Seomun Market are still flourishing in the city.\nAdditionally, Daegu was considered the third major economic city in Korea, after Seoul and Busan. However, due to the decline of the textile industry, which is the heart of Daegu's economy, the overall economic growth of the city has also fallen.\nAlso, the city is the warmest region in South Korea due to the humid subtropical climate. This climate condition provides the region with high quality apples and oriental melons. The fruit industry is a crucial support for the local economy. Due to the stagnant economy, Daegu's population began to decrease after 2003. Recently, the local government has begun focusing on working towards economic revival and concentrating on improving the city's fashion industry.\n\n\n=== Fashion industry ===\nBeginning in the late 1990s, Daegu has been actively making efforts to promote its fashion industry based on its textile and clothing manufacturing industries under the 'Daegu: Fashion City'. The city opens many exhibitions related to the fashion and textile industries including the Daegu Fashion Fair and Preview in Daegu annually or semi-annually, and invites national institutes. A large new town specializing in the textile-fashion industries is currently under construction in Bongmu-dong, northeastern Daegu. The district, officially named Esiapolis, takes aim at the fashion hub of East Asia. Textile complexes, textile-fashion institutions, an international school, fashion malls as well as residential areas plan to be developed in the district.\n\n\n== Culture and sightseeing ==\n\nGenerally Daegu is known as a conservative city. As well as being the largest inland city in the country beside Seoul it has become one of the major metropolitan areas in the nation. Traditionally, Buddhism has been strong; today there are still many temples. Confucianism is also popular in Daegu, with a large academy based in the city. Neon cross-topped spires of Christian churches can also be seen in the city.\n\n\n=== Sights ===\nThe most well-known sight of the city is the stone Buddha called Gatbawi on the top of Gwanbong, Palgongsan. It is famous for its stone gat (Korean traditional hat). People from all over the country visit the place, because they believe that the Buddha will grant one's single desire. Administratively, the site itself is located in the neighboring city, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk.\n\nOn the outskirts of the city, mountains keep many traditional temples such as Donghwasa, Pagyesa, and Buinsa. Donghwasa is a Buddhist temple that was built by Priest Geukdal-hwasang in 493, and many artifacts of the period are found around the temple. The International Tourist Zen Meditation Center is Korea's only Zen-themed center. Some lecture halls or memorial halls such as Dodong-seowon (\ub3c4\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9053\u6771\u66f8\u9662) and Nokdong-seowon (\ub179\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9e7f\u6d1e\u66f8\u9662) are also located in the suburbs.\nOld villages have been preserved, such as the Otgol village (Gyeongju Choi clan's original residence area) and the Inheung village (Nampyeong Mun's). In the urban area, the Joseon Dynasty's administrative or educational buildings including Gyeongsang-gamyeong (\uacbd\uc0c1\uac10\uc601, \u6176\u5c19\u76e3\u71df) and Daegu-hyanggyo (\ub300\uad6c\ud5a5\uad50, \u5927\u90b1\u9115\u6821) also remain. The main gateway of the city in that period called Yeongnam-jeilmun (\uc601\ub0a8\uc81c\uc77c\ubb38, \u5dba\u5357\u7b2c\u4e00\u9580, meaning the first gateway in Yeongnam), has been restored in Mangudang Park. Western style modern architecture like Gyesan Cathedral and the old building of Jeil Church are preserved across the urban area. Gyesan Cathedral is the third oldest gothic church building in Korea and the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Daegu which is one of three archdioceses in South Korea. Several buildings, in the present Keisung Academy and the KNU middle/high school, are famous too.\nYangnyeongsi (\uc57d\ub839\uc2dc, \u85e5\u4ee4\u5e02) in Namseongno (often called Yakjeon-golmok) is the oldest market for Korean medicinal herbs in the country with a history of 350 years. Bongsan-dong which has some art galleries and studios is being developed as the artistic center of the city since the 1990s.\nNearby tourist attractions include Haeinsa\u2014a Buddhist temple that houses the Tripitaka Koreana (a woodblock edition of the Tripitaka and one of the world's oldest extant complete collections of the Buddhist scriptures). Haeinsa is located in Gayasan National Park of Hapcheon, Gyeongnam. The historic city of Gyeongju, Gyeongbuk, the capital of the ancient kingdom of Silla is located east of Daegu.\n\n\n=== Mountains and parks ===\n\nMt. Palgong, Mt. Biseul, and Mt. Ap are the representative mountains in Daegu. Apsan, just in the southern part of the city, is the closest mountain from the urban area among them. It has many trails, Buddhist temples, a Korean War museum, and a gondola ride to the peak. Additionally, Waryongsan, Hamjisan, and Yongjibong are located in the city. These serve as neighborhood parks to the citizens. Mt. Palgong has a cable car to the summit. There are also hiking trails in the direction of the Donghwasa Temple and Sutaegol Valley.\nIn the urban area, several small mountains and hills play the same role. Dalseong Park, which sits inside a 1,500-year-old earth fortress, is a historic place of the city. It contains the city's only zoo and some monuments as well as the wall. Duryu Park or Duryusan is a large forest in the middle of the urban area. It has Daegu Tower, Woobang Land, Kolon Bandstand, Duryu Stadium, and many sports facilities. Daegu Tower, also called Woobang Tower or Duryu Tower, is the tallest contemporary structure (202 m) and a symbol of the city. Its observatory commands good views of the surroundings. Woobang Land is the largest amusement park out of the capital area. Many small gardens lie in the heart of the city, such as the National Debt Repayment Movement Memorial Park (Gukchae Bosang Park) and 2\u00b728 Park. The former park includes Dalgubeol-daejong (\ub2ec\uad6c\ubc8c\ub300\uc885, \u9054\u53e5\u4f10\u5927\u9418), which means the Dalgubeol grand bell. The bell is struck every week and year. There is also a botanical garden with a variety of plants and flowers.\n\n\n=== Downtown and shopping ===\nDongseongno (\ub3d9\uc131\ub85c, \u6771\u57ce\u8def) is the downtown of Daegu lying from the Daegu Station to Jung-ang pachulso (central police station) near the Banwoldang subway station in the center of the city Jung-gu. It has the Jung-angno subway station as the nearest station from its heart. Like its name meaning the street in the east fortress, the eastern part of Daegu-eupseong (\ub300\uad6c\uc74d\uc131, \u5927\u90b1\u9091\u57ce, means the Daegu-Principality Fortress) was situated along this street. The fortress, however, had been demolished in the early 20th century. Although Daegu is the nation's third or fourth largest city, the Dongseongno area form the largest and the broadest downtown area in the whole country except the capital city, Seoul.  In most cases, famous brands open their branch shop first here out of the Greater Seoul area.\n\nSub-downtowns in the city have its own commercial powers and colors. The area around the Seongseo Industrial Complex subway station in Dalseo-gu is a concentration of many amusement spots, and young people easily can be seen around Kyungpook National University in Buk-gu. Deuran-gil (means the street inside the field) in Suseong-gu is known for many restaurants.\nThe city has a number of department stores. Many of these belong to national or multinational chains, but the local Daegu Department Store also operates two branches, while another local chain, Donga Department Store operates four in the city proper. The six department stores among them gather at the downtown. The traditional markets such as Seomun Market and Chilseong Market sell all sorts of goods.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nMany traditional ceremonies and festivals in agrarian society disappeared in the process of modernization.

        "wiki": "Lee Yong-soo (born December 13, 1928) is a former comfort woman from South Korea. Lee was forced to serve as a sex slave during World War II with the Imperial Japanese Army. She is one of the youngest comfort women still living.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLee Yong-soo was born in Daegu, South Korea on December 13, 1928. Lee was sixteen when she was forced to become a comfort woman. She was outside near a riverbank, catching snails with her friend Bunsun, when both were captured by a military man. She and her friend were taken by train, and then switched to a boat at Anju. On the boat, which was headed to a Kamikaze Unit in Hsinchu County, Taiwan, she was raped for the first time. She recalls that on average, she was forced into sexual relations with four to five men a day and did not have any rest even when she was menstruating. She also says that she \"suffered electrical torture, was beaten and was cut by a soldier's knife.\" She learned quickly to submit so that she would not be shocked or beaten again. Lee says that she never thought to run away because she did not know how to leave the area even if she did escape. Additionally, she was isolated from the other comfort women in her area. After the war and her return home, she said that her family no longer recognized her and she did not feel fit to get married. She was ashamed of what happened to her, and did not realize that it had also happened to so many other women.Lee first came forward to testify about her experience as a comfort woman in June 1992. She was influenced by Kim Hak-sun's press conference on TV to finally talk to others. Yong-soo registered with the Korean government as a comfort woman. She was the twenty-ninth woman to testify about her experiences. Coming forward gave her life a true purpose: \"I thought I was worthless. I didn't talk about it, and nobody asked me. Until the women came out, I did not exist.\"In 1996, Lee attended Kyungpook National University and eventually received her master's degree in 2001.At the Women's International War Crimes Tribunal on Japan's Military Sexual Slavery held in Tokyo in 2000, she testified about what happened to her during World War II, and then later shared her story at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.In 2007, she testified in front of the United States joint Congressional session about her experiences during World War II. She said, \"I am an honorable daughter of Korea, I am not a comfort woman.\" Her experience at the hands of the Japanese Army was described as \"traumatic.\" After her testimony, the Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, came out and denied that Japan was culpable and that a former apology from Japan's cabinet in 1993 was not necessary. Nevertheless, the outcome of her testimony (along with the testimony of two other comfort women) led to the House passing a resolution which asked the Japanese government to apologize formally to former comfort women. The resolution was passed unanimously.Right-wing elements in the Japanese government have been trying to erase the history of comfort woman from the record. This is what Yong-soo and others are fighting against. In 2014, Lee Yong-soo met with Pope Francis. As a devout Catholic, she hoped that the Pope could help end their pain.In 2015, she attended the South Korean National Assembly's exhibition of art created by former comfort women. Later, she traveled to San Francisco to receive a commendation award from city council and also to ask the city to install a memorial to former comfort women. She was a guest of California Representative Mike Honda in 2015. Yong-soo also participated in protests in the United States when Prime Minister Abe visited.Lee Yong-soo continues to participate in weekly demonstrations held on Wednesdays in front of the Japanese Embassy. She always wears a traditional Korean hanbok, including the dongjeong, beoseon and gomusin so that everyone who sees her knows that \"I am a Joseon daughter. I am an honorable Korean.\" She says, \"I don't want to advertise that I am a comfort women victim. Rather, I want to be a problem solver that can ensure that there will be no other victims of war such as us.\" She says that she will not give up until Prime Minister Abe acknowledges the truth of her and other women's testimonies.In May 2020, Lee accused the Korean Council for Justice and Remembrance and Yoon Mee-hyang, the former head, of misusing funds and embezzlement. As a result, Lee said she would no longer attend the Wednesday demonstrations and called for Yoon Mee-hyang resign from becoming a member of the National Assembly. However, on May 27, Lee made a surprise appearance at one of the Wednesday demostrations in Daegu. \n\n\n== References ==",

Also, it is the second largest city in the Yeongnam region after Busan. However, it is the fourth city in terms of population after Seoul, Busan and Incheon. It was overtaken by Incheon in the 2000s, but still it is said to be the third city according to the \"Act on the Establishment of Daegu City and Incheon City\" (Act No. 3424 and April 13, 1981). Daegu and surrounding North Gyeongsang Province are often referred to as Daegu-Gyeongbuk, with a total population over 5 million. \nDaegu is located in south-eastern Korea about 80 km (50 mi) from the seacoast, near the Geumho River and its mainstream, Nakdong River in Gyeongsang-do. The Daegu basin is the central plain of the Yeongnam region. In ancient times, the Daegu area was part of the proto-kingdom Jinhan. Subsequently, Daegu came under the control of the Silla Kingdom, which unified the Korean Peninsula. During the Joseon Dynasty period, the city was the capital of Gyeongsang-do, one of the traditional eight provinces of the country.\nDaegu was an economic motor of Korea during the 1960s\u20131980s period and was especially known for its electronics industry. The humid subtropical climate of Daegu is ideal for producing high-quality apples, thus the nickname, \"Apple City\". Daegu is also known as \"Textile City\". Textiles used to be the pillar industry of the city. With the establishment of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone, Daegu is currently focusing on fostering fashion and high-tech industries.\nDaegu was the host city of the 22nd World Energy Congress, the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, and the 2003 Summer Universiade. It also hosted four matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory and early history ===\nArchaeological investigations in the Greater Daegu area have revealed a large number of settlements and burials of the prehistoric Mumun Pottery Period (around 1500\u2013300 BC). In fact, some of the earliest evidence of Mumun settlement in Gyeongsangdo have been excavated from Siji-dong and Seobyeon-dong. Dongcheon-dong is one of the substantial Mumun agricultural villages that have been excavated. The Dongcheon-dong site dates back to the Middle Mumun (around 850\u2013550 BC) and contains the remains of many prehistoric pit-houses and agricultural fields. Megalithic burials (dolmens) have also been found in large numbers in Daegu.\nAncient historical texts indicate that during the Proto\u2013Three Kingdoms (Mahan, Jinhan, and Byeonhan) period, Daegu was the site of a chiefdom or walled-town polity known from that time, according to historical records, as Dalgubeol. It was absorbed into the kingdom of Silla no later than the fifth century. The vestiges of the wall can be seen, and relics have been excavated in the current Dalseong Park.\n\n\n=== Silla ===\nSilla succeeded in unifying the Korean peninsula by defeating the other kingdoms of Baekje and Koguryo in the late seventh century, partly due to assistance from China's Tang Dynasty. Shortly thereafter, in 689, Silla's King Sinmun considered moving the capital from Gyeongju to Daegu, but was unable to do so.  This initiative is known only through a single line in the Samguk Sagi, a most valued historical record of ancient Korea by Koryeo Dynasty historian Kim Bu-sik, but it is presumed to indicate both an attempt by the Silla king to reinforce royal authority and the entrenched resistance of the Gyeongju political elites that was the likely cause of the move's failure. The city was given its current name in 757.\nIn the late 1990s, archaeologists excavated a large-scale fortified Silla site in Dongcheon-dong, Buk-gu. The site at Locality 2 consists of the remains of 39 raised-floor buildings enclosed by a formidable ditch-and-palisade system. The excavators hypothesize that the fortified site was a permanent military encampment or barracks. Archaeologists also uncovered a large Silla village dating to the sixth to seventh centuries AD at Siji-dong.\n\n\n=== Later Three Kingdoms and Goryeo ===\nDuring the Later Three Kingdoms period, 892\u2013936, Daegu was initially aligned with Hubaekje. In 927, northern Daegu was the site of the Battle of Gong Mountain between the forces of Goryeo under Wang Geon and those of Hubaekje under Gyeon Hwon. In this battle, the forces of Goryeo were crushed and Wang Geon himself was saved only by the heroic deed of his general Shin Sung-gyeom. However,  the atrocities of the Hubaekje forces at this time apparently changed local sympathizers to favor Wang Geon, who later became the king of Goryeo.\nNumerous place names and local legends in the area still bear witness to the historic battle of 927. Among these are \"Ansim\", which literally means \"peace of mind\", said to be the first place where Wang Geon dared to stop after escaping the battle, and \"Banwol\", or half-moon, where he is said to have stopped and admired the moon before returning to Goryeo. A statue commemorating the battle now stands in northern Daegu, as does a memorial to Sin Sunggyeom.\nIn the Goryeo period, the first edition of the Tripitaka Koreana was stored in Daegu, at the temple of Buinsa.  However, this edition was destroyed when the temple was sacked in 1254, during the Mongol invasions of Korea.\n\n\n=== Joseon ===\n\nDaegu served as an important transportation center during the Joseon Dynasty. She stands in the mid part of the Great Yeongnam Road which ran between Seoul and Busan. It lay at the junction of this arterial road and the roads to Gyeongju and Jinju.\nIn 1601, Daegu became the administrative capital of the Gyeongsang-do, which is current Daegu, Busan, Ulsan, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and Gyeongsangnam-do. At about that time, the city began to grow into a major city. The status continued for nearly 300 years, and the city has been transformed as the capital of Gyeongsangbuk-do since Gyeongsang-do was divided into two provinces, Gyeongsangbuk-do (northern Gyeongsang-province) and Gyeongsangnam-do (southern one) in 1896.\nDaegu's first regular markets were established during the late Joseon period. The most famous of these is the Yangnyeongsi herbal medicine market. This became a center of herbal trade in Joseon, and even attracted buyers from neighboring countries. Traders from Japan, who were not permitted to leave the Nakdong River valley, hired messengers to visit the market on their behalf. Seomun Market, which stood at the city's west gate at that time, was one of the top-three markets in the Joseon period.\n\n\n=== Korean Empire and colonial rule ===\nThe Korean hermit kingdom finally opened itself to the outside world in the late 19th century. In 1895, Daegu became the site of one of the country's first modern post offices, as a part of the 'Gab-o' reforms introduced in the aftermath of the Sino-Japanese war.Beginning in the late 1890s, increasing numbers of foreign merchants and workers started to visit Daegu, which emerged as a modern transportation center of the newly constructed Gyeongbu Line main railroad connecting Seoul and Busan.\nIn 1905, the old fortress wall was forcibly destroyed. The wall still survives only in the street names such as the streets Dongseongno and Bukseongno, \"east fortress street\" and \"north fortress street\", which now run where the wall once stood.\nIndependence movements against imperial aggressions were outstanding in Daegu. These began as early as 1898, when a branch of the Independence Club was opened in the town.  As the demise of the Korean Empire approached in 1907, local citizens led by Seo Sang-don organized the National Debt Repayment Movement. The movement spread nationwide, although it fell short of repaying the national debt through individual donations. Freedom fighting continued after the 1910 annexation, notably during the March 1st movement of 1919. At that time, four major demonstrations took place in Daegu, involving an estimated 23,000 peace-loving citizens.\n\n\n=== After 1945 ===\nIn 1946, the Daegu October Incident took place, one of the most serious social disorders since the foundation of the Republic of Korea. An operation by the Korean national police to take control of rioters on October 1 resulted in the death of three student demonstrators and injuries to many others, sparking a massive counter-attack, killing as many as 38 policemen. It was also the site of major demonstrations on February 28, 1960, prior to the presidential election of that year.Daegu and all of North Gyeongsang province had heavy guerrilla activities in the late 1940s, as thousands of refugees shied away from the fighting in Jeolla province and sought shelters in Daegu.  In November 1948, a unit in Daegu joined the mutiny which had begun in Yeosu the previous month.During the Korean War, heavy fighting occurred nearby along the Nakdong River. Daegu sat inside the Pusan Perimeter, however, so remained in South Korean hands throughout the war. As in many other areas during the Korean War, political killings of dissenters were widespread. A large series of engagements was fought around the city to prevent North Korean troops from crossing the Nakdong, the Battle of Taegu.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the city underwent explosive growth, and the population has increased more than tenfold since the end of the Korean War. The city was politically favored during the 18-year-long rule of Park Chung-hee, when it and the surrounding area served as his political base. Daegu champions conservative political ideas and movements today and is a political base for the Saenuri Party.\nIn the 1980s, Daegu separated from Gyeongsangbuk-do and became a separately administered provincial-level directly governed city (Jikhalsi), and was redesignated as a metropolitan city (Gwangyeoksi) in 1995. Today, Daegu is the third-largest metropolitan area in Korea with respect to both population and commerce.\nIn February 2020, Daegu became known for the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nTwo local governments are in the city, the Daegu Metropolitan Government in Jung District and Gyeongbuk Provincial Government in Buk District. The provincial government will be relocated to Andong in its proper province, Gyeongbuk. The mayor and heads of city's eight districts are directly elected by the citizens every four years. The city council has 29 members which consist of 26 from the same number of electoral districts and three proportional representations. They are also directly elected every four years. Most of them are the members of the Liberty Korea Party, the main conservative political party in South Korea. Daegu is a stronghold for the party and has produced two Presidents of the Republic of Korea thus far: Roh Tae-woo and Park Geun-hye. As the capital of the Korean conservatives, the city has wielded strong political influence in elections.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nDaegu is divided into 7 districts (Gu) and 1 county (Gun)\n\nJung District (\uc911\uad6c, \u4e2d\u5340) \u2013 means the central district.\nDong District (\ub3d9\uad6c, \u6771\u5340) \u2013 means the east district.\nSeo District (\uc11c\uad6c, \u897f\u5340) \u2013 means the west district.\nNam District (\ub0a8\uad6c, \u5357\u5340) \u2013 means the south district.\nBuk District (\ubd81\uad6c, \u5317\u5340) \u2013 means the north district.\nSuseong District (\uc218\uc131\uad6c, \u58fd\u57ce\u5340)\nDalseo District (\ub2ec\uc11c\uad6c, \u9054\u897f\u5340)\nDalseong County (\ub2ec\uc131\uad70, \u9054\u57ce\u90e1)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nDaegu sits in a basin surrounded by low mountains. Palgongsan to the north, Biseulsan to the south, Waryongsan to the west, and a series of smaller hills in the east. The Geumho River flows along the northern and eastern edges of the city, emptying in the Nakdong River west of the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDaegu has a cooler version of a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa). In Holdridge climate classification, Daegu has a warm temperate moist forest climate. The mountains that comprise the basin trap hot and humid air. Similarly, in winter, cold air lies in the basin. The area receives little precipitation except during the rainy season of summer, and is sunny throughout much of the year. Data gathered since 1961 indicates that the mean temperature for January, the coldest month in Daegu, is 0.6 \u00b0C (33 \u00b0F) and that for August, the warmest month, is 26.4 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F). The City's lowest record temperature was \u221220.2 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F), and the City's highest record temperature was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F). The 40 degrees Celsius recorded in 1942 is also the highest temperature record in South Korea since the observation. This summer temperature has led to the emergence of a new term called Dae-Prika (Daegu+Africa) starting with the Internet community, and has recently been used in the media, broadcasting, etc. \n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nDaegu is a manufacturing industry city. The major industries are textiles, metals and machinery. In the year 2010, Daegu had a regional GDP of $45,387 million with 7.2% real GDP growth rate. The GDP per capita though is well below Korea national average. Many companies such as Daegu Bank, Korea Delphi, Hwasung corp., and TaeguTec are situated in this city, and Samsung and Kolon were founded here. Numerous factories are located in the industrial complexes situated in the west and north sides of the city including the Seongseo Industrial Complex, West Daegu Industrial Complex and the Daegu Dyeing Industrial Complex.\nThe city is the economic and industrial core of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk region, one of the major industrial areas in Korea. It accounted for as much as 94 percent of Korea's trade surplus in 2006. The electronics industries in Gumi and the steel industries in Pohang provided great services to that surplus. World-leading manufacturing facilities for Anycall (Samsung Mobile) and POSCO's main factories are located near the city. Daegu and its neighbouring cities were designated for the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone by the central government in 2008. It is specialized companies like Winitech software company in knowledge-based service and manufacturing industries.\nHistorically, Daegu has been the commercial center of the southern part of the Korean Peninsula with Seoul in the center and Pyongyang in the north (currently North Korea), because of its advantageous location. Some of the large, traditional markets like Seomun Market are still flourishing in the city.\nAdditionally, Daegu was considered the third major economic city in Korea, after Seoul and Busan. However, due to the decline of the textile industry, which is the heart of Daegu's economy, the overall economic growth of the city has also fallen.\nAlso, the city is the warmest region in South Korea due to the humid subtropical climate. This climate condition provides the region with high quality apples and oriental melons. The fruit industry is a crucial support for the local economy. Due to the stagnant economy, Daegu's population began to decrease after 2003. Recently, the local government has begun focusing on working towards economic revival and concentrating on improving the city's fashion industry.\n\n\n=== Fashion industry ===\nBeginning in the late 1990s, Daegu has been actively making efforts to promote its fashion industry based on its textile and clothing manufacturing industries under the 'Daegu: Fashion City'. The city opens many exhibitions related to the fashion and textile industries including the Daegu Fashion Fair and Preview in Daegu annually or semi-annually, and invites national institutes. A large new town specializing in the textile-fashion industries is currently under construction in Bongmu-dong, northeastern Daegu. The district, officially named Esiapolis, takes aim at the fashion hub of East Asia. Textile complexes, textile-fashion institutions, an international school, fashion malls as well as residential areas plan to be developed in the district.\n\n\n== Culture and sightseeing ==\n\nGenerally Daegu is known as a conservative city. As well as being the largest inland city in the country beside Seoul it has become one of the major metropolitan areas in the nation. Traditionally, Buddhism has been strong; today there are still many temples. Confucianism is also popular in Daegu, with a large academy based in the city. Neon cross-topped spires of Christian churches can also be seen in the city.\n\n\n=== Sights ===\nThe most well-known sight of the city is the stone Buddha called Gatbawi on the top of Gwanbong, Palgongsan. It is famous for its stone gat (Korean traditional hat). People from all over the country visit the place, because they believe that the Buddha will grant one's single desire. Administratively, the site itself is located in the neighboring city, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk.\n\nOn the outskirts of the city, mountains keep many traditional temples such as Donghwasa, Pagyesa, and Buinsa. Donghwasa is a Buddhist temple that was built by Priest Geukdal-hwasang in 493, and many artifacts of the period are found around the temple. The International Tourist Zen Meditation Center is Korea's only Zen-themed center. Some lecture halls or memorial halls such as Dodong-seowon (\ub3c4\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9053\u6771\u66f8\u9662) and Nokdong-seowon (\ub179\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9e7f\u6d1e\u66f8\u9662) are also located in the suburbs.\nOld villages have been preserved, such as the Otgol village (Gyeongju Choi clan's original residence area) and the Inheung village (Nampyeong Mun's). In the urban area, the Joseon Dynasty's administrative or educational buildings including Gyeongsang-gamyeong (\uacbd\uc0c1\uac10\uc601, \u6176\u5c19\u76e3\u71df) and Daegu-hyanggyo (\ub300\uad6c\ud5a5\uad50, \u5927\u90b1\u9115\u6821) also remain. The main gateway of the city in that period called Yeongnam-jeilmun (\uc601\ub0a8\uc81c\uc77c\ubb38, \u5dba\u5357\u7b2c\u4e00\u9580, meaning the first gateway in Yeongnam), has been restored in Mangudang Park. Western style modern architecture like Gyesan Cathedral and the old building of Jeil Church are preserved across the urban area. Gyesan Cathedral is the third oldest gothic church building in Korea and the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Daegu which is one of three archdioceses in South Korea. Several buildings, in the present Keisung Academy and the KNU middle/high school, are famous too.\nYangnyeongsi (\uc57d\ub839\uc2dc, \u85e5\u4ee4\u5e02) in Namseongno (often called Yakjeon-golmok) is the oldest market for Korean medicinal herbs in the country with a history of 350 years. Bongsan-dong which has some art galleries and studios is being developed as the artistic center of the city since the 1990s.\nNearby tourist attractions include Haeinsa\u2014a Buddhist temple that houses the Tripitaka Koreana (a woodblock edition of the Tripitaka and one of the world's oldest extant complete collections of the Buddhist scriptures). Haeinsa is located in Gayasan National Park of Hapcheon, Gyeongnam. The historic city of Gyeongju, Gyeongbuk, the capital of the ancient kingdom of Silla is located east of Daegu.\n\n\n=== Mountains and parks ===\n\nMt. Palgong, Mt. Biseul, and Mt. Ap are the representative mountains in Daegu. Apsan, just in the southern part of the city, is the closest mountain from the urban area among them. It has many trails, Buddhist temples, a Korean War museum, and a gondola ride to the peak. Additionally, Waryongsan, Hamjisan, and Yongjibong are located in the city. These serve as neighborhood parks to the citizens. Mt. Palgong has a cable car to the summit. There are also hiking trails in the direction of the Donghwasa Temple and Sutaegol Valley.\nIn the urban area, several small mountains and hills play the same role. Dalseong Park, which sits inside a 1,500-year-old earth fortress, is a historic place of the city. It contains the city's only zoo and some monuments as well as the wall. Duryu Park or Duryusan is a large forest in the middle of the urban area. It has Daegu Tower, Woobang Land, Kolon Bandstand, Duryu Stadium, and many sports facilities. Daegu Tower, also called Woobang Tower or Duryu Tower, is the tallest contemporary structure (202 m) and a symbol of the city. Its observatory commands good views of the surroundings. Woobang Land is the largest amusement park out of the capital area. Many small gardens lie in the heart of the city, such as the National Debt Repayment Movement Memorial Park (Gukchae Bosang Park) and 2\u00b728 Park. The former park includes Dalgubeol-daejong (\ub2ec\uad6c\ubc8c\ub300\uc885, \u9054\u53e5\u4f10\u5927\u9418), which means the Dalgubeol grand bell. The bell is struck every week and year. There is also a botanical garden with a variety of plants and flowers.\n\n\n=== Downtown and shopping ===\nDongseongno (\ub3d9\uc131\ub85c, \u6771\u57ce\u8def) is the downtown of Daegu lying from the Daegu Station to Jung-ang pachulso (central police station) near the Banwoldang subway station in the center of the city Jung-gu. It has the Jung-angno subway station as the nearest station from its heart. Like its name meaning the street in the east fortress, the eastern part of Daegu-eupseong (\ub300\uad6c\uc74d\uc131, \u5927\u90b1\u9091\u57ce, means the Daegu-Principality Fortress) was situated along this street. The fortress, however, had been demolished in the early 20th century. Although Daegu is the nation's third or fourth largest city, the Dongseongno area form the largest and the broadest downtown area in the whole country except the capital city, Seoul.  In most cases, famous brands open their branch shop first here out of the Greater Seoul area.\n\nSub-downtowns in the city have its own commercial powers and colors. The area around the Seongseo Industrial Complex subway station in Dalseo-gu is a concentration of many amusement spots, and young people easily can be seen around Kyungpook National University in Buk-gu. Deuran-gil (means the street inside the field) in Suseong-gu is known for many restaurants.\nThe city has a number of department stores. Many of these belong to national or multinational chains, but the local Daegu Department Store also operates two branches, while another local chain, Donga Department Store operates four in the city proper. The six department stores among them gather at the downtown. The traditional markets such as Seomun Market and Chilseong Market sell all sorts of goods.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nMany traditional ceremonies and festivals in agrarian society disappeared in the process of modernization. A Confucian ritual ceremony called Seokjeondaeje is held at Daegu-hyanggyo every spring and autumn. The Yangnyeongsi herb medical festival and Otgol village festival are the contemporary festivals about traditional culture.\nLately in the city, enthusiasm about performing arts is growing and the local government is trying to meet its demand. Daegu International Opera Festival (DIOF) in October since 2003, Daegu International Musical Festival (DIMF), and Daegu International Bodypainting Festival (DIBF) are three of the most famous festivals on each field in Korea, although those have short histories.\nVarious festivals in various themes like the Colorful Daegu Festival, Dongseongno festival, Palgongsan maple festival, Biseulsan azalea festival, Korea in Motion Daegu, and so on, are held by the city, each ward, or the specific groups, all through the year.\nOn August 25 through August 31, 2008, Daegu hosted the first ever Asian Bodypainting Festival, a sister event of the World Bodypainting Festival in Seeboden, Austria.\nEach year the city is home to the Daegu International Jazz Festival: http://www.dijf.or.kr/\nEvery May the \"Colorful Daegu Festival\" offers performances and art programs including the Colorful Parade. In July, the Daegu Chimac Festival takes place at Duryu Park in Dalseo-gu, Daegu. The term \"chimac\" is a portmanteau of chicken and maekju (meaning \"beer\"). There were over 880,000 visitors in 2015, and one million visitors during the festival in 2016.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nDaegu Art Museum\nDaegu National Museum \u2013 A notable national museum collecting relics excavated in and around Daegu\nDaegu Bangjja Yugi (Korean Bronzeware) Museum\nHengso Museum of Keimyung University\nKorea Video Museum\nKyungpook National University Museum\nMuseum for Daegu National University of Education\nMuseum of Natural Dye Arts\n\n\n=== Theaters ===\nDaegu Opera House \u2013 The first theater in Korea only for performing opera\nSuseong Artpia\nKeimyung Art Center \u2013 One of the largest scale theaters in the city.\nDaegu Culture and Arts Center\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nOn March 27, 2007, the city was selected to host the 2011 World Championships in Athletics. Daegu competed with cities such as Moscow, Russia and Brisbane, Australia to earn the votes of the IAAF Council. The event was the fourth IAAF World Championships in Athletics to be held outside Europe, and the first games in mainland Asia. It was also the third worldwide sports event held in Korea after the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul and 2002 FIFA World Cup in Korea and Japan. Daegu also hosted three matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, and the 2003 Summer Universiade. The city hosts the Colorful Daegu Pre-Championships Meeting every year since 2005.\n\nDaegu Stadium is the second largest sports complex in South Korea with a seating capacity of 66,422. Daegu Civic Stadium hosted some football matches at the 1988 Summer Olympics.\nThe Daegu Marathon is held here every year in April. The race begins and ends at the Daegu Stadium.\n\n\n==== Sports teams ====\n\n\n===== The Samsung Lions =====\nThe Samsung Lions (Hangul: \uc0bc\uc131 \ub77c\uc774\uc628\uc988) are a South Korean professional baseball team founded in 1982.

They cover to Gyeongsangbuk-do out of the city. Each television broadcasting company has its own radio station as well.\n\n\n=== International Daegu ===\nDaegu is largely a homogeneous community that includes few non-Koreans. However, a number of immigrants from South and Southeast Asia work in automotive-parts factories on the city's west side. In addition, there is a small group of English-speaking Westerners working in English schools and university programs. The American military bases are also home to several hundred Americans. Recently Chinese students have begun studying Korean at universities in Daegu, and there is an increasing number of graduate and post-graduate students from other Asian countries. As elsewhere in Korea, Korean food overwhelmingly dominates; Chinese, Japanese and Western food forms the bulk of non-Korean food but recently Indian and Russian foods have become available.\nDaegu hosts three American military bases, Camp Henry, Camp George which houses Daegu American School, and Camp Walker. Camp Walker houses Daegu High School for high school children, while Camp George hold the school for elementary and middle school (both of which are primarily for children of military personnel and US Military civilian employees).

Also, it is the second largest city in the Yeongnam region after Busan. However, it is the fourth city in terms of population after Seoul, Busan and Incheon. It was overtaken by Incheon in the 2000s, but still it is said to be the third city according to the \"Act on the Establishment of Daegu City and Incheon City\" (Act No. 3424 and April 13, 1981). Daegu and surrounding North Gyeongsang Province are often referred to as Daegu-Gyeongbuk, with a total population over 5 million. \nDaegu is located in south-eastern Korea about 80 km (50 mi) from the seacoast, near the Geumho River and its mainstream, Nakdong River in Gyeongsang-do. The Daegu basin is the central plain of the Yeongnam region. In ancient times, the Daegu area was part of the proto-kingdom Jinhan. Subsequently, Daegu came under the control of the Silla Kingdom, which unified the Korean Peninsula. During the Joseon Dynasty period, the city was the capital of Gyeongsang-do, one of the traditional eight provinces of the country.\nDaegu was an economic motor of Korea during the 1960s\u20131980s period and was especially known for its electronics industry. The humid subtropical climate of Daegu is ideal for producing high-quality apples, thus the nickname, \"Apple City\". Daegu is also known as \"Textile City\". Textiles used to be the pillar industry of the city. With the establishment of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone, Daegu is currently focusing on fostering fashion and high-tech industries.\nDaegu was the host city of the 22nd World Energy Congress, the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, and the 2003 Summer Universiade. It also hosted four matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory and early history ===\nArchaeological investigations in the Greater Daegu area have revealed a large number of settlements and burials of the prehistoric Mumun Pottery Period (around 1500\u2013300 BC). In fact, some of the earliest evidence of Mumun settlement in Gyeongsangdo have been excavated from Siji-dong and Seobyeon-dong. Dongcheon-dong is one of the substantial Mumun agricultural villages that have been excavated. The Dongcheon-dong site dates back to the Middle Mumun (around 850\u2013550 BC) and contains the remains of many prehistoric pit-houses and agricultural fields. Megalithic burials (dolmens) have also been found in large numbers in Daegu.\nAncient historical texts indicate that during the Proto\u2013Three Kingdoms (Mahan, Jinhan, and Byeonhan) period, Daegu was the site of a chiefdom or walled-town polity known from that time, according to historical records, as Dalgubeol. It was absorbed into the kingdom of Silla no later than the fifth century. The vestiges of the wall can be seen, and relics have been excavated in the current Dalseong Park.\n\n\n=== Silla ===\nSilla succeeded in unifying the Korean peninsula by defeating the other kingdoms of Baekje and Koguryo in the late seventh century, partly due to assistance from China's Tang Dynasty. Shortly thereafter, in 689, Silla's King Sinmun considered moving the capital from Gyeongju to Daegu, but was unable to do so.  This initiative is known only through a single line in the Samguk Sagi, a most valued historical record of ancient Korea by Koryeo Dynasty historian Kim Bu-sik, but it is presumed to indicate both an attempt by the Silla king to reinforce royal authority and the entrenched resistance of the Gyeongju political elites that was the likely cause of the move's failure. The city was given its current name in 757.\nIn the late 1990s, archaeologists excavated a large-scale fortified Silla site in Dongcheon-dong, Buk-gu. The site at Locality 2 consists of the remains of 39 raised-floor buildings enclosed by a formidable ditch-and-palisade system. The excavators hypothesize that the fortified site was a permanent military encampment or barracks. Archaeologists also uncovered a large Silla village dating to the sixth to seventh centuries AD at Siji-dong.\n\n\n=== Later Three Kingdoms and Goryeo ===\nDuring the Later Three Kingdoms period, 892\u2013936, Daegu was initially aligned with Hubaekje. In 927, northern Daegu was the site of the Battle of Gong Mountain between the forces of Goryeo under Wang Geon and those of Hubaekje under Gyeon Hwon. In this battle, the forces of Goryeo were crushed and Wang Geon himself was saved only by the heroic deed of his general Shin Sung-gyeom. However,  the atrocities of the Hubaekje forces at this time apparently changed local sympathizers to favor Wang Geon, who later became the king of Goryeo.\nNumerous place names and local legends in the area still bear witness to the historic battle of 927. Among these are \"Ansim\", which literally means \"peace of mind\", said to be the first place where Wang Geon dared to stop after escaping the battle, and \"Banwol\", or half-moon, where he is said to have stopped and admired the moon before returning to Goryeo. A statue commemorating the battle now stands in northern Daegu, as does a memorial to Sin Sunggyeom.\nIn the Goryeo period, the first edition of the Tripitaka Koreana was stored in Daegu, at the temple of Buinsa.  However, this edition was destroyed when the temple was sacked in 1254, during the Mongol invasions of Korea.\n\n\n=== Joseon ===\n\nDaegu served as an important transportation center during the Joseon Dynasty. She stands in the mid part of the Great Yeongnam Road which ran between Seoul and Busan. It lay at the junction of this arterial road and the roads to Gyeongju and Jinju.\nIn 1601, Daegu became the administrative capital of the Gyeongsang-do, which is current Daegu, Busan, Ulsan, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and Gyeongsangnam-do. At about that time, the city began to grow into a major city. The status continued for nearly 300 years, and the city has been transformed as the capital of Gyeongsangbuk-do since Gyeongsang-do was divided into two provinces, Gyeongsangbuk-do (northern Gyeongsang-province) and Gyeongsangnam-do (southern one) in 1896.\nDaegu's first regular markets were established during the late Joseon period. The most famous of these is the Yangnyeongsi herbal medicine market. This became a center of herbal trade in Joseon, and even attracted buyers from neighboring countries. Traders from Japan, who were not permitted to leave the Nakdong River valley, hired messengers to visit the market on their behalf. Seomun Market, which stood at the city's west gate at that time, was one of the top-three markets in the Joseon period.\n\n\n=== Korean Empire and colonial rule ===\nThe Korean hermit kingdom finally opened itself to the outside world in the late 19th century. In 1895, Daegu became the site of one of the country's first modern post offices, as a part of the 'Gab-o' reforms introduced in the aftermath of the Sino-Japanese war.Beginning in the late 1890s, increasing numbers of foreign merchants and workers started to visit Daegu, which emerged as a modern transportation center of the newly constructed Gyeongbu Line main railroad connecting Seoul and Busan.\nIn 1905, the old fortress wall was forcibly destroyed. The wall still survives only in the street names such as the streets Dongseongno and Bukseongno, \"east fortress street\" and \"north fortress street\", which now run where the wall once stood.\nIndependence movements against imperial aggressions were outstanding in Daegu. These began as early as 1898, when a branch of the Independence Club was opened in the town.  As the demise of the Korean Empire approached in 1907, local citizens led by Seo Sang-don organized the National Debt Repayment Movement. The movement spread nationwide, although it fell short of repaying the national debt through individual donations. Freedom fighting continued after the 1910 annexation, notably during the March 1st movement of 1919. At that time, four major demonstrations took place in Daegu, involving an estimated 23,000 peace-loving citizens.\n\n\n=== After 1945 ===\nIn 1946, the Daegu October Incident took place, one of the most serious social disorders since the foundation of the Republic of Korea. An operation by the Korean national police to take control of rioters on October 1 resulted in the death of three student demonstrators and injuries to many others, sparking a massive counter-attack, killing as many as 38 policemen. It was also the site of major demonstrations on February 28, 1960, prior to the presidential election of that year.Daegu and all of North Gyeongsang province had heavy guerrilla activities in the late 1940s, as thousands of refugees shied away from the fighting in Jeolla province and sought shelters in Daegu.  In November 1948, a unit in Daegu joined the mutiny which had begun in Yeosu the previous month.During the Korean War, heavy fighting occurred nearby along the Nakdong River. Daegu sat inside the Pusan Perimeter, however, so remained in South Korean hands throughout the war. As in many other areas during the Korean War, political killings of dissenters were widespread. A large series of engagements was fought around the city to prevent North Korean troops from crossing the Nakdong, the Battle of Taegu.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the city underwent explosive growth, and the population has increased more than tenfold since the end of the Korean War. The city was politically favored during the 18-year-long rule of Park Chung-hee, when it and the surrounding area served as his political base. Daegu champions conservative political ideas and movements today and is a political base for the Saenuri Party.\nIn the 1980s, Daegu separated from Gyeongsangbuk-do and became a separately administered provincial-level directly governed city (Jikhalsi), and was redesignated as a metropolitan city (Gwangyeoksi) in 1995. Today, Daegu is the third-largest metropolitan area in Korea with respect to both population and commerce.\nIn February 2020, Daegu became known for the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nTwo local governments are in the city, the Daegu Metropolitan Government in Jung District and Gyeongbuk Provincial Government in Buk District. The provincial government will be relocated to Andong in its proper province, Gyeongbuk. The mayor and heads of city's eight districts are directly elected by the citizens every four years. The city council has 29 members which consist of 26 from the same number of electoral districts and three proportional representations. They are also directly elected every four years. Most of them are the members of the Liberty Korea Party, the main conservative political party in South Korea. Daegu is a stronghold for the party and has produced two Presidents of the Republic of Korea thus far: Roh Tae-woo and Park Geun-hye. As the capital of the Korean conservatives, the city has wielded strong political influence in elections.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nDaegu is divided into 7 districts (Gu) and 1 county (Gun)\n\nJung District (\uc911\uad6c, \u4e2d\u5340) \u2013 means the central district.\nDong District (\ub3d9\uad6c, \u6771\u5340) \u2013 means the east district.\nSeo District (\uc11c\uad6c, \u897f\u5340) \u2013 means the west district.\nNam District (\ub0a8\uad6c, \u5357\u5340) \u2013 means the south district.\nBuk District (\ubd81\uad6c, \u5317\u5340) \u2013 means the north district.\nSuseong District (\uc218\uc131\uad6c, \u58fd\u57ce\u5340)\nDalseo District (\ub2ec\uc11c\uad6c, \u9054\u897f\u5340)\nDalseong County (\ub2ec\uc131\uad70, \u9054\u57ce\u90e1)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nDaegu sits in a basin surrounded by low mountains. Palgongsan to the north, Biseulsan to the south, Waryongsan to the west, and a series of smaller hills in the east. The Geumho River flows along the northern and eastern edges of the city, emptying in the Nakdong River west of the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDaegu has a cooler version of a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa). In Holdridge climate classification, Daegu has a warm temperate moist forest climate. The mountains that comprise the basin trap hot and humid air. Similarly, in winter, cold air lies in the basin. The area receives little precipitation except during the rainy season of summer, and is sunny throughout much of the year. Data gathered since 1961 indicates that the mean temperature for January, the coldest month in Daegu, is 0.6 \u00b0C (33 \u00b0F) and that for August, the warmest month, is 26.4 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F). The City's lowest record temperature was \u221220.2 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F), and the City's highest record temperature was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F). The 40 degrees Celsius recorded in 1942 is also the highest temperature record in South Korea since the observation. This summer temperature has led to the emergence of a new term called Dae-Prika (Daegu+Africa) starting with the Internet community, and has recently been used in the media, broadcasting, etc. \n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nDaegu is a manufacturing industry city. The major industries are textiles, metals and machinery. In the year 2010, Daegu had a regional GDP of $45,387 million with 7.2% real GDP growth rate. The GDP per capita though is well below Korea national average. Many companies such as Daegu Bank, Korea Delphi, Hwasung corp., and TaeguTec are situated in this city, and Samsung and Kolon were founded here. Numerous factories are located in the industrial complexes situated in the west and north sides of the city including the Seongseo Industrial Complex, West Daegu Industrial Complex and the Daegu Dyeing Industrial Complex.\nThe city is the economic and industrial core of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk region, one of the major industrial areas in Korea. It accounted for as much as 94 percent of Korea's trade surplus in 2006. The electronics industries in Gumi and the steel industries in Pohang provided great services to that surplus. World-leading manufacturing facilities for Anycall (Samsung Mobile) and POSCO's main factories are located near the city. Daegu and its neighbouring cities were designated for the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone by the central government in 2008. It is specialized companies like Winitech software company in knowledge-based service and manufacturing industries.\nHistorically, Daegu has been the commercial center of the southern part of the Korean Peninsula with Seoul in the center and Pyongyang in the north (currently North Korea), because of its advantageous location. Some of the large, traditional markets like Seomun Market are still flourishing in the city.\nAdditionally, Daegu was considered the third major economic city in Korea, after Seoul and Busan. However, due to the decline of the textile industry, which is the heart of Daegu's economy, the overall economic growth of the city has also fallen.\nAlso, the city is the warmest region in South Korea due to the humid subtropical climate. This climate condition provides the region with high quality apples and oriental melons. The fruit industry is a crucial support for the local economy. Due to the stagnant economy, Daegu's population began to decrease after 2003. Recently, the local government has begun focusing on working towards economic revival and concentrating on improving the city's fashion industry.\n\n\n=== Fashion industry ===\nBeginning in the late 1990s, Daegu has been actively making efforts to promote its fashion industry based on its textile and clothing manufacturing industries under the 'Daegu: Fashion City'. The city opens many exhibitions related to the fashion and textile industries including the Daegu Fashion Fair and Preview in Daegu annually or semi-annually, and invites national institutes. A large new town specializing in the textile-fashion industries is currently under construction in Bongmu-dong, northeastern Daegu. The district, officially named Esiapolis, takes aim at the fashion hub of East Asia. Textile complexes, textile-fashion institutions, an international school, fashion malls as well as residential areas plan to be developed in the district.\n\n\n== Culture and sightseeing ==\n\nGenerally Daegu is known as a conservative city. As well as being the largest inland city in the country beside Seoul it has become one of the major metropolitan areas in the nation. Traditionally, Buddhism has been strong; today there are still many temples. Confucianism is also popular in Daegu, with a large academy based in the city. Neon cross-topped spires of Christian churches can also be seen in the city.\n\n\n=== Sights ===\nThe most well-known sight of the city is the stone Buddha called Gatbawi on the top of Gwanbong, Palgongsan. It is famous for its stone gat (Korean traditional hat). People from all over the country visit the place, because they believe that the Buddha will grant one's single desire. Administratively, the site itself is located in the neighboring city, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk.\n\nOn the outskirts of the city, mountains keep many traditional temples such as Donghwasa, Pagyesa, and Buinsa. Donghwasa is a Buddhist temple that was built by Priest Geukdal-hwasang in 493, and many artifacts of the period are found around the temple. The International Tourist Zen Meditation Center is Korea's only Zen-themed center. Some lecture halls or memorial halls such as Dodong-seowon (\ub3c4\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9053\u6771\u66f8\u9662) and Nokdong-seowon (\ub179\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9e7f\u6d1e\u66f8\u9662) are also located in the suburbs.\nOld villages have been preserved, such as the Otgol village (Gyeongju Choi clan's original residence area) and the Inheung village (Nampyeong Mun's). In the urban area, the Joseon Dynasty's administrative or educational buildings including Gyeongsang-gamyeong (\uacbd\uc0c1\uac10\uc601, \u6176\u5c19\u76e3\u71df) and Daegu-hyanggyo (\ub300\uad6c\ud5a5\uad50, \u5927\u90b1\u9115\u6821) also remain. The main gateway of the city in that period called Yeongnam-jeilmun (\uc601\ub0a8\uc81c\uc77c\ubb38, \u5dba\u5357\u7b2c\u4e00\u9580, meaning the first gateway in Yeongnam), has been restored in Mangudang Park. Western style modern architecture like Gyesan Cathedral and the old building of Jeil Church are preserved across the urban area. Gyesan Cathedral is the third oldest gothic church building in Korea and the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Daegu which is one of three archdioceses in South Korea. Several buildings, in the present Keisung Academy and the KNU middle/high school, are famous too.\nYangnyeongsi (\uc57d\ub839\uc2dc, \u85e5\u4ee4\u5e02) in Namseongno (often called Yakjeon-golmok) is the oldest market for Korean medicinal herbs in the country with a history of 350 years. Bongsan-dong which has some art galleries and studios is being developed as the artistic center of the city since the 1990s.\nNearby tourist attractions include Haeinsa\u2014a Buddhist temple that houses the Tripitaka Koreana (a woodblock edition of the Tripitaka and one of the world's oldest extant complete collections of the Buddhist scriptures). Haeinsa is located in Gayasan National Park of Hapcheon, Gyeongnam. The historic city of Gyeongju, Gyeongbuk, the capital of the ancient kingdom of Silla is located east of Daegu.\n\n\n=== Mountains and parks ===\n\nMt. Palgong, Mt. Biseul, and Mt. Ap are the representative mountains in Daegu. Apsan, just in the southern part of the city, is the closest mountain from the urban area among them. It has many trails, Buddhist temples, a Korean War museum, and a gondola ride to the peak. Additionally, Waryongsan, Hamjisan, and Yongjibong are located in the city. These serve as neighborhood parks to the citizens. Mt. Palgong has a cable car to the summit. There are also hiking trails in the direction of the Donghwasa Temple and Sutaegol Valley.\nIn the urban area, several small mountains and hills play the same role. Dalseong Park, which sits inside a 1,500-year-old earth fortress, is a historic place of the city. It contains the city's only zoo and some monuments as well as the wall. Duryu Park or Duryusan is a large forest in the middle of the urban area. It has Daegu Tower, Woobang Land, Kolon Bandstand, Duryu Stadium, and many sports facilities. Daegu Tower, also called Woobang Tower or Duryu Tower, is the tallest contemporary structure (202 m) and a symbol of the city. Its observatory commands good views of the surroundings. Woobang Land is the largest amusement park out of the capital area. Many small gardens lie in the heart of the city, such as the National Debt Repayment Movement Memorial Park (Gukchae Bosang Park) and 2\u00b728 Park. The former park includes Dalgubeol-daejong (\ub2ec\uad6c\ubc8c\ub300\uc885, \u9054\u53e5\u4f10\u5927\u9418), which means the Dalgubeol grand bell. The bell is struck every week and year. There is also a botanical garden with a variety of plants and flowers.\n\n\n=== Downtown and shopping ===\nDongseongno (\ub3d9\uc131\ub85c, \u6771\u57ce\u8def) is the downtown of Daegu lying from the Daegu Station to Jung-ang pachulso (central police station) near the Banwoldang subway station in the center of the city Jung-gu. It has the Jung-angno subway station as the nearest station from its heart. Like its name meaning the street in the east fortress, the eastern part of Daegu-eupseong (\ub300\uad6c\uc74d\uc131, \u5927\u90b1\u9091\u57ce, means the Daegu-Principality Fortress) was situated along this street. The fortress, however, had been demolished in the early 20th century. Although Daegu is the nation's third or fourth largest city, the Dongseongno area form the largest and the broadest downtown area in the whole country except the capital city, Seoul.  In most cases, famous brands open their branch shop first here out of the Greater Seoul area.\n\nSub-downtowns in the city have its own commercial powers and colors. The area around the Seongseo Industrial Complex subway station in Dalseo-gu is a concentration of many amusement spots, and young people easily can be seen around Kyungpook National University in Buk-gu. Deuran-gil (means the street inside the field) in Suseong-gu is known for many restaurants.\nThe city has a number of department stores. Many of these belong to national or multinational chains, but the local Daegu Department Store also operates two branches, while another local chain, Donga Department Store operates four in the city proper. The six department stores among them gather at the downtown. The traditional markets such as Seomun Market and Chilseong Market sell all sorts of goods.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nMany traditional ceremonies and festivals in agrarian society disappeared in the process of modernization. A Confucian ritual ceremony called Seokjeondaeje is held at Daegu-hyanggyo every spring and autumn. The Yangnyeongsi herb medical festival and Otgol village festival are the contemporary festivals about traditional culture.\nLately in the city, enthusiasm about performing arts is growing and the local government is trying to meet its demand. Daegu International Opera Festival (DIOF) in October since 2003, Daegu International Musical Festival (DIMF), and Daegu International Bodypainting Festival (DIBF) are three of the most famous festivals on each field in Korea, although those have short histories.\nVarious festivals in various themes like the Colorful Daegu Festival, Dongseongno festival, Palgongsan maple festival, Biseulsan azalea festival, Korea in Motion Daegu, and so on, are held by the city, each ward, or the specific groups, all through the year.\nOn August 25 through August 31, 2008, Daegu hosted the first ever Asian Bodypainting Festival, a sister event of the World Bodypainting Festival in Seeboden, Austria.\nEach year the city is home to the Daegu International Jazz Festival: http://www.dijf.or.kr/\nEvery May the \"Colorful Daegu Festival\" offers performances and art programs including the Colorful Parade. In July, the Daegu Chimac Festival takes place at Duryu Park in Dalseo-gu, Daegu. The term \"chimac\" is a portmanteau of chicken and maekju (meaning \"beer\"). There were over 880,000 visitors in 2015, and one million visitors during the festival in 2016.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nDaegu Art Museum\nDaegu National Museum \u2013 A notable national museum collecting relics excavated in and around Daegu\nDaegu Bangjja Yugi (Korean Bronzeware) Museum\nHengso Museum of Keimyung University\nKorea Video Museum\nKyungpook National University Museum\nMuseum for Daegu National University of Education\nMuseum of Natural Dye Arts\n\n\n=== Theaters ===\nDaegu Opera House \u2013 The first theater in Korea only for performing opera\nSuseong Artpia\nKeimyung Art Center \u2013 One of the largest scale theaters in the city.\nDaegu Culture and Arts Center\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nOn March 27, 2007, the city was selected to host the 2011 World Championships in Athletics. Daegu competed with cities such as Moscow, Russia and Brisbane, Australia to earn the votes of the IAAF Council. The event was the fourth IAAF World Championships in Athletics to be held outside Europe, and the first games in mainland Asia. It was also the third worldwide sports event held in Korea after the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul and 2002 FIFA World Cup in Korea and Japan. Daegu also hosted three matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, and the 2003 Summer Universiade. The city hosts the Colorful Daegu Pre-Championships Meeting every year since 2005.\n\nDaegu Stadium is the second largest sports complex in South Korea with a seating capacity of 66,422. Daegu Civic Stadium hosted some football matches at the 1988 Summer Olympics.\nThe Daegu Marathon is held here every year in April. The race begins and ends at the Daegu Stadium.\n\n\n==== Sports teams ====\n\n\n===== The Samsung Lions =====\nThe Samsung Lions (Hangul: \uc0bc\uc131 \ub77c\uc774\uc628\uc988) are a South Korean professional baseball team founded in 1982.

These are affiliated companies of central broadcasting stations in Seoul just like other local broadcasting companies in South Korea. TBC (Taegu Broadcasting Corporation) depends on SBS. They cover to Gyeongsangbuk-do out of the city. Each television broadcasting company has its own radio station as well.\n\n\n=== International Daegu ===\nDaegu is largely a homogeneous community that includes few non-Koreans. However, a number of immigrants from South and Southeast Asia work in automotive-parts factories on the city's west side. In addition, there is a small group of English-speaking Westerners working in English schools and university programs. The American military bases are also home to several hundred Americans. Recently Chinese students have begun studying Korean at universities in Daegu, and there is an increasing number of graduate and post-graduate students from other Asian countries. As elsewhere in Korea, Korean food overwhelmingly dominates; Chinese, Japanese and Western food forms the bulk of non-Korean food but recently Indian and Russian foods have become available.\nDaegu hosts three American military bases, Camp Henry, Camp George which houses Daegu American School, and Camp Walker. Camp Walker houses Daegu High School for high school children, while Camp George hold the school for elementary and middle school (both of which are primarily for children of military personnel and US Military civilian employees). Camp George also houses most of the married [Enlisted] ranked soldiers. Camp Henry and Camp Walker serve as the primary place of work for all the military personnel. Camp Walker serves as the home to enlisted Sergeants Major and Officer ranked soldiers, Major and up. Although non-military families can enroll their children at the school, most either home-school their children or send them to a small Christian private school which teaches about 25 children near the central business district of Daegu.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\nAccording to the census of 2015, of the people of Daegu 50.5% follow Buddhism and 17.9% follow Christianity (12% Protestantism and 5.8% Catholicism). 34.7% of the population is mostly not religious or follow other indigenous religions.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nAs of 2019, Daegu has 229 elementary schools, 125 middle schools including the Dong-Pyeong Middle School, and 93 high schools. There are two specialized public high schools which are Daegu Science High School and Taegu Foreign Language High School, and some other high schools such as Keisung Academy, Gyeongsin High School and Daeryun High School have good grades for university admission. Most of well-known high schools are located in Suseong-gu because its educational grade and zeal are high standard in the country.\nAlso, Daegu has 4 independent private high schools like Keisung Academy (also called Keisung High School), Gyeongsin High School, Gyeong-il Girl's High School, Daegun Catholic High School.\n\n\n=== Universities and colleges ===\n\nDaegu and its satellite towns are one of the areas which have the largest private higher educational institutions in Korea. Many of their main campuses are located in the nearby Gyeongsan city which serves the Daegu region as a college town. Kyungpook National University (KNU) is one of the most highly ranked and well organized national universities in Korea. It holds first place in and around the city in almost all of the fields. Daegu has two of the most prestigious private universities outside Seoul, Yeungnam University\uff08YU\uff09and Keimyung University.  There are some smaller private universities such as Catholic University of Daegu and Daegu University.

        "wiki": "Gayasan National Park, also known as Gaya Mountain National Park (Korean: \uac00\uc57c\uc0b0\uad6d\ub9bd\uacf5\uc6d0), is a large national park in the eastern part of South Korea. The park is named in honor of Gaya Mountain and became a National Park in 1972.\nThe park includes Haeinsa, which is one of the main temples of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nGayasan National Park covers an area of more than 160 square kilometers. The national park extends from the northern edge of South Gyeongsang Province, to the southern limit of North Gyeongsang Province. The Sobaek Mountain range runs through this area.\n\n\n=== Gaya Mountain ===\n\nThe national park is named in honor of Gaya Mountain. This mountain has two major peaks: one of them is Sangwangbong Peak, for which the height is 1,430 meters, and the other slightly higher peak, Chulbulbong, is 1,433 above sea level.\n\n\n== Special features ==\n\nOne significant feature of the national park is Haeinsa. This Buddhist temple includes in its grounds a standing Buddha figure carved into a vertical rock.\nAnother feature of the park is Yongmun Falls and Hongnyudong Valley. 380 different species of plant have been identified as growing there, as well as 100 species of birds, and other wild animals.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area was declared scenic site number 5 by the Korean government in 1966, and it became an official National Park in 1972.\nThe remoteness of the area has played a role in protecting it from destruction in the past, specifically during the Japanese invasions of 1592-98, when much of the country was razed.\nSince that time, legend says that the area around Gaya Mountains is free from the Three Disasters: fire, floods and wind.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe park's page on Korea National Park Service's website\n Gayasan Mountain National Park travel guide from Wikivoyage\nKorea in the Clouds: A Detailed Guide to Hiking Korea's Mountains\nPrintable Trailmap of Gayasan (from Korea in the Clouds)",

        "wiki": "Shinsegae (Korean: \uc2e0\uc138\uacc4, KRX: 004170) is a South Korean department store franchise, along with several other businesses, headquartered in Seoul, South Korea. The name Shinsegae literally means \"New World\" in Korean. Its flagship store in Centum City, Busan, was the world's largest department store at 3,163,000 square feet (293,900 m2), surpassing  Macy's flagship Herald Square in New York City in 2009.\nShinsegae was originally part of the Samsung Group chaebol, separated in the 1990s from the Samsung Group along with CJ Group  (Food/Chemicals/Entertainment), Saehan Group (Electronic Media/Apparel/Textiles), and the Hansol Group (Paper/Telecom). The chairman Lee Myung-hee is the daughter of Samsung founder Lee Byung-chull and younger sister of the chairman of Samsung Electronics Lee Kun-hee.\nThe group owns the brands Shinsegae and E-Mart, and is in direct competition with Lotte Shopping and Hyundai Department Store Group. Currently it is the largest retailer in South Korea.Shinsegae is also famous for its long history. The main branch of Shinsegae is the oldest department store in Korea. The main building of the store was opened in 1930 as the Gyeongseong branch of Mitsukoshi, a Japanese department store franchise; Korea was occupied by the Japanese Empire at the time. The store was acquired in 1945 by the late founder of Samsung group, Lee Byung-chull, and renamed Donghwa Department Store. After the Korean War (1950\u20131953) began, it was used for several years as a post exchange by the American army. In 1963, the store was given the name Shinsegae. The old building is currently used as a luxury shopping venue.\nShinsegae was the first credit card company in South Korea. They issued their own charge card from 1967 to 2000. In 2000, Shinsegae sold their credit card division to KorAm Bank, which was later acquired by Citibank Korea.\n\n\n== Stores ==\n\nMain Store (Main Building & New Building) (\ubcf8\uc810 \ubcf8\uad00, \uc2e0\uad00) in Jung-gu, Seoul\nGangnam Store (Main Building & New Building) (\uac15\ub0a8\uc810 \ubcf8\uad00, \uc2e0\uad00) in Seocho-gu, Seoul the express bus terminal, flagship store turn-over 1billion USD per year top sales store of Shinsegae\nYeongdeungpo Store (Building A, Building B & Luxury Hall) (\uc601\ub4f1\ud3ec\uc810 A\uad00, B\uad00, \uba85\ud488\uad00) in Times Square, Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul\nIncheon Store (\uc778\ucc9c\uc810) in Nam-gu, Incheon\nGyeonggi Store (\uacbd\uae30\uc810) in Suji-gu, Yong-in, Gyeonggi-do (Changed its name from Jukjeon Store on October 26, 2009)\nShinsegae Centum City (\uc2e0\uc138\uacc4 \uc13c\ud140\uc2dc\ud2f0) in Centum City, Hae-undae-gu, Busan (the world's largest department store)\nMasan Store (\ub9c8\uc0b0\uc810) in Masan-Happo-gu, Changwon, Gyeongsangnam-do\nGwangju Shinsegae (\uad11\uc8fc\uc2e0\uc138\uacc4, KRX: 037710) in Seo-gu, Gwangju\nChungcheong Store (\ucda9\uccad\uc810) in Dongnam-gu, Cheon-an, Chungcheongnam-do (Through a management alliance with Arario, owner of Yawoori Department Store, Shinsegae opened this branch in Cheon-an in the building once used as Galleria Cheon-an Store and Yawoori Department Store)\nUijeongbu Store (\uc758\uc815\ubd80\uc810) in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi-do\nHanam Store (\ud558\ub0a8\uc810) in Hanam, Gyeonggi-do\nGimhae Store (\uae40\ud574\uc810) in Gimhae, Gyeongsangnam-do\nDaegu Shinsegae (\ub300\uad6c\uc2e0\uc138\uacc4) in Dongdaegu station, DaeguShinsegae also has a small branch in Incheon International Airport, and a supermarket in Dogok-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul.\nShinsegae launched the Shinsegae Style Market, a smaller shopping mall mainly aimed at young customers, in 2010.

          "The park itself feels a little bit like a haunted theme park. There was hardly anybody there and most of the rides weren't in use. The only good thing to see is the Daegu tower which offers some impressive views of all of Daegu. My recommendations - better to save your money",
          "If you go after 5pm it's only 16,000 won ($14). The views from the top of the tower are impressive and when we went they were doing a special light show for Christmas. It's expensive but if you're young at heart you'll enjoy it. There's a couple great roller coasters, bumper",

        "wiki": "Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond, formerly known as Anapji, is an artificial pond in Gyeongju National Park, South Korea.  It was part of the palace complex of ancient Silla (57 BCE \u2013 935 CE).  It was constructed by order of King Munmu in 674 CE.  The pond is situated at the northeast edge of the Banwolseong palace site, in central Gyeongju. It is an oval shape; 200m from east to west and 180m from north to south. It contains three small islands.\n\n\n== History ==\nAnapji was originally located near the palace of Silla called Banwolseong. It is written in Samguk Sagi: \"During the era of King Munmu, a new pond was made in the palace and flowers and birds flourished in this pond\". There is also mention of a royal reception held by King Gyeongsun in 931, when Silla was already crumbling.\nAfter the fall of Silla, the pond fell into disrepair for many centuries. The name Anapji appears in the 16th century Joseon era document Augmented Survey of the Geography of Korea (hangul:\ub3d9\uad6d\uc5ec\uc9c0\uc2b9\ub78c, hanja:\u6771\u570b\u8f3f\u5730\u52dd\u89bd) with the explanation that King Munmu made the pond with Taoist aesthetics.\n\n\n== Renovation and excavation of relics ==\nAs part of the renovation project of historic sites in Gyeongju, Anapji was dredged and rebuilt in 1974. The long-term excavation project from March 1975 to December 1986 released a large number of relics from the pond. Research revealed that the pond had been surrounded by stone walls, and that 5 buildings had been standing on the pond's west to south sides. Waterway systems were also detected.\nAlmost 33,000 pieces of historic relics were excavated from the site. An abundance of unique and extraordinarily designed roof tiles, architectural materials, pottery, gilt bronze figures of Buddha, jewelry, accessories and other everyday items were discovered, offering an insight to Buddhist art and everyday life in Silla.\n\n\n== Tourist destination ==\nAnapji is currently allotted in Inwang-dong, Gyeongju and is part of Gyeongju National Park. Approximately 730 relics are on display at the Anapji Exhibition Hall, the special gallery of the Gyeongju National Museum. The site of Imhaejeon is also a part of the grounds, the most important building on the property and the structure used as the crown prince\u2019s palace. While some sites have been restored others have been left in the natural form.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nSilla\nList of Korea-related topics\nList of South Korean tourist attractions\nHistory of Korea\nBanwolseong\n\n\n== References ==\n\nDaegu MBC editing team, Anapji p4, Book Sorie, Seoul, 2004.

          "So many people are coming especially during the evening when the sun is down. Thousands of same photos taken by every person. Nevertheless this is the place, which everybody should see in Korea. So nice. You can imagine the times of the imperium and the princess walking in",

          "As you are walking around the tombs or museum you might as well visit here as well. We entered about 45 minutes before sunset and walked around the main west side of the pond taking pictures and enjoying the evening. By the end we walked around the east side and watched the",
          "Worth the entrance ticket and visit. The light up structure is beautiful and the water in the still pond give a nice reflection.",
          "Went there at night, it was chilling and windy. Good for a walk but I came same timing with the tour bus. So bit noisy and crowded. The pond at night was lighten up and reflected the building. It's beautiful however camera phone may not works well at night. So this was a place",
          "although the remains left are really \"remains\" having a look at the reproduction gives you a better sense of the \"palace\" meaning at that time, a rest at the pavillion is a must (when the wind blows)",
          "The Pagoda is lit up so beautifully at night and the lights reflect off of the pond. In addition, the lotus gardens are absolutely amazing. If you go at night beware of the may bugs drawn to the lights.",

Good place but there are too many people taking photo of place or themselves. I was confused why",

          "This place is highly recommended to be visited during the night due to how the lights from the buildings and trees reflect on the lake. You'll need to pay an entrance fee for this place and there's a path circling the pond that you'll need to follow. No doubt the place is",
          "This is an area where they found archeological evidence of buildings and a huge pond, and they've rebuilt it to a degree. The pond is really beautiful! There's no way to know for sure what it looked like in the past, but the modern version is amazing. The buildings/pavilions",
          "A nice walk and a few good spots for pictures along the pond. Worth it if you have the time. 2000won per person and it is open until 10pm so you can check out the lit up pavilions.",

          "Visited this reconstructed 'palace' as part of a day trip; wished we could have stayed to see it at night when it was lit up. Anyhow, we had a nice peaceful walk around the like during the day. The few reconstructed buildings were nice but hardly represent what the original",

          "The pond is beautifully lit at night and a very peaceful experience. Good for groups, couples, and kids. The entire event takes about about 1 hour to finish. Restrooms, gift shop, and vending machines are located at the entrance/exit. Taxi stand and bus stop are nearby.",
          "I mistakenly thought that there was a whole palace by the pond, not just three reconstructed buildings. There's not a lot to see here accordingly (maybe better at night?) It's nice enough, but not sure it's worth the 2,000 won entrance fee.",
          "I went there in winter, so it was very cold (so bring warm clothes if your planning to do this in winter, since it is open). However, it was sooooo worth it! We went at night and it is just stunning! I definitely recommend it. Go at night, not sure how it will look during the",
          "I think this site is better to see at nighttime when the buildings and the pond are lit up. During the day it wasn't as special but this was the only time we could go.",
          "This is a restoration of a Silla-era castle and the views gives you a feeling of how the people from the past admires the beauty of nature combined with intricate asian architecture. There is a 2$ entrance fee.",

          "I went here on the nighttime at first, but soon gave up due to the LONG line. Ended up coming back the next morning, and I have to say the pond is very breathtaking even in the daylight. A bit warm, but you can see everything clear as day. It's considerably less crowded in the",
          "Serene and elegant, for me the Pond really did live up to its reputation as the palatial party venue for the royalty in its past life. I recommend taking a walk around the pond - if going in summer mozzie spray before is a must! There are beautiful spots to take photographs",
          "This is an absolutely breath-taking pond. We spent an hour walking around the pond and every angle was photo worthy. It's a great spot for the family but be warned it can be a bit tiring on a very hot summer's day.",
          "Visited on a day trip around the attractions of central Gyeongu. Nice pond and ruins of a large palace, a few of the buildings have been rebuilt to give an impression of what was here. More of a park than a palace building but nice to wander around and take in from different",
          "Night or day, this pond and the rebuilt pagoda's are fantastic in all conditions. Great to slow down and to become aware of the enormous importance of the grounds that you're standing on.",
          "Fantastic area with lots of ancient artefacts that were dug up and 3 rebuilt pagoda's. Great to walk around (especially in the evenings) with the pond and the views.",
          "It's a gorgeous area to walk around especially at night. We had a great time walking the field of flowers and then seeing the buildings lit at night reflecting into the pond. It was super crowded in Aug especially at night so if you want to avoid crowds better to go during the",
          "Loved the scenery of this pond, beautiful especially at night. Would recommend to visit in the evening as its cooling and relaxing to go for a walk. Located near the Cheomseongdae Observatory.",
          "No amount of sageuk watching could have prepared me for this magnificent view at Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond in Gyeongju! This place is seriously breathtaking after dark. We did the audio tour, which was very informative.",
          "You want to go here. I was here during the sunset. It's maybe better to go there during the day and then during the night (darkness hours) - check the opening/closing time. The lights are very beautiful on the temples.",
          "This place was really nice for walking by yourself or with your friends and family. All the buildings in the pond are so beautiful and even mysterious. A kind taxi driver who took me to the place kindly guided me at the pond and shared a secret of finding a real good view :",
          "Important historical site which now has three open restored pavilions. There is a small walking track around the pond which has some lotus flowers. Apparently beautifully lit at night. Located across the road from the museum. Buses 10, 11 and others from the station or middle of",
          "A friend of ours showed us around Gyeongju and we stopped here for a little bit on the way to lunch. It's a pretty little area, lots of people were kinda just hanging out in the shade of the buildings for a bit as it was a pretty hot day. It's nice to see during the day and take",
          "Visited after sunset, very busy with local people. Pedestrian flow seems to be clockwise, ie, view from the reconstructed buildings first, then walk around the garden area. W2000 entry, last admittance 21h30",
          "Visit in the evening to capture the beautifully illuminated buildings and compound, and also the reflection on the pond. Unfortunately, one of the buildings was under restoration during our visit in mid Nov-16. The view might not be spectacular during the day time. There is",
          "Only a few of the buildings have been rebuilt, perhaps they will develop it more in the future. It could be good stop to take some pictures but not much to see here. Make it a short stop on the way to somewhere else if you're passing by.",
          "A lovely walk in the park and around the pond which is the official Shila hosting facilities near the palace.",
          "Colourful and nice place with reconstructed houses. Nice relics from kingdom Silla on display ar one house.",
          "This is beautiful garden. Clean, quiet, with many benches around the pond. There are nice fish in the pond. I liked this place very much.",
          "We visited late in the afternoon, the grounds are a little sparse, the pond area is beautiful. We hope they continue the restoration into the future of the full castle grounds and older buildings.",
          "This place has the X Factor at night. Everywhere you walked at night around the lake was spectacular. The reflections on the lake were amazing at night. In the day time, it was a normal park. Quiet and peaceful during the day light at hours.",
          "We were surprised to enjoy stunningly beautiful night view of the Palace Gates. The lights were artistically located all over the park and it was enjoyable to walk around and marvel at the architectures and landscapes.",
          "We were advised to check it out by night, so we did. And we were totally charmed! The reflection of trees and the buildings in the water make the promenade in the park most enjoyable. We were subdued!! I belive it is a must to see when coming to Gyeongju.",
          "We took a day trip from Busan to Gyeongju so we had little choice but to visit this temple in full daylight. This is kind of a shame in hindsight as it was very underwhelming during the day. Just a pond filled with carp and some vaguely interesting temple-style buildings. Worth",
          "my timing was a bit off, as i visited this place too early when it was still too bright for beautiful lights. a great place for a walk, but i feel that it is very plain without the lights that I've been wanting to see. it was also very windy and cold so the view i got wasn't",
          "Lovely place for night photo, easy to reach by bus. If you want to get the great picture, it is suggest to go there before one hour of sunset.",
          "The pond is like glass that reflects the nicely lit buildings. There are informative displays showing some of the historical relics.",
          "The only downsize of this place was the people on the ticketing counter being almost nervous to get your money right away, had pressure for very little people being there or not line up at all. They need more training and less judgment looks.",
          "If you are in Gyeongju, please make sure to visit this place, especially at night !!! I have been here for 3 times when I visited Korea yearly !!! The night illumination of the pavillion around the pond were vividly reflected on the pond, and on a calm clear night, it was like",
          "It was very romantic to take a nice walk around the lake with beautiful Korean tradition romantic to al music playing",
          "It is a large artificial pond that was part of the Banwolseong Palace complex of ancient Silla Kingdom. It has been carefully restored and information provided at the pavilion beside the pond. Very tranquil setting among the trees on the far corner of the complex. Good photo",
          "Visited here in mid-November, both during the day and at night. Night is more stunning, especially the reflections of the buildings and trees in the pond. It is a photographers dream! One of the buildings is currently under reconstruction so that detracted just a bit from the",
          "Best timing to enter the place was around 4.30 ( day light photo ) .. sunset was very early .. around 5.30pm .. entire park was in dark / night feels.. n lighting was on during that's time .. night reflection photo around the pond",
          "Ruins and nothing else..Took an audio guide and before i arrived at location 6,the \"tour\" was done in 20 minutes.Don't really recommend it.",
          "Little is left of what was originally the prince's palace, save for a few pavilions. Yet, on a still night, it becomes a surreal, almost magical to walk. You walk a short loop around the pond, and seeing the reflections of the pavilions lit up, reflecting off of the water, is",
          "during the day in summer it is a nice location but it truly becomes beautiful at night or when the leaves are colored or I assume with snow",
          "A rather nice palace surrounded by an artificial lake. Tour guides encourage to see it at night when the flood lights are on. A quick visit is worth your while if you happen to be in this area.",
          "Nice views at night when it is all lit up, but it will be very busy! Entry is 2,000 won and we spent about half an hour here. Unfortunately one of the buildings was under construction during our visit on 5 November 2016.",
          "Spectacular at night when they light up the main buildings and surroundings. Nice reflection. Beautiful pond with water plants.",
          "A serene, aesthetically pleasing pond. One can have a lovely wander around, sit in a pavillion and ponder at the water and nice gardens. Lovely.",
          "Quite a small complex but the view is nice and easy access. Recommend to visit at around 6 pm after they turn on the lights.",
          "It's breezy, green and peaceful. After a bit of cycling, we were kind of tired. We walk around the pond and find a tree shades. We lay down under the tree and had a 30mins nap. Very nice, very peaceful. I love this place. hope to visit again for the night view.",
          "Anapji Pond is a tiny park with a few reconstructed buildings that showcase some of the artifacts that were found in this Silla era site. While not large, the park does provide a perfect spot to get away from the bigger crowds and rest by the side of the pond and listen to ducks",
          "Some parts were under construction, but ideally you need to get to only one of the pavilions to get a feel for the place. The pond is great and the night lighting would make it more interesting although we did see it during the day. It will be helpful to visit the National",
          "A lot is made of this pond but it's a few small pavilions with a pond. Nice enough but needs more seating (my husband has problems walking and near the pavilions there were no seats). Large groups of tourists were also being herded round by women with microphones and",
          "Everything you see is actually a reconstruction. We found it useful to first stop by across the street to see the animation movie 'Screening for Silla Palaces'. It shows you how the Silla capital of Gyeongju used to look and why the pond is shaped the way it is. Surrounding the",
          "The site itself is a reconstruction of 3 palaces (1 still underway). The buildings are beautiful and the settings are beautiful. It is recommended to be there a short time before sunset and stay while the lights are turned on and sunlight fades totally. Free admittance.",
          "saw this at night and fairly well lit. out of season so the flowers were dying and droopy but such a lovely statement like lily pads for the area",
          "We were recommended to go to Anapji pond by our accommodation's host, especially at sunset. There's not much to see in the old palace gardens complex, except at sunset, when all the tourists walk around the other side of the pond and progressively take photos of the structures",
          "This place is simply stunning at night. There are a lot of tourists but I can't express how beautiful it is. Its worth it to visit here at night.",
          "Holding the title of the Eastern palace, the compound consist of only three big pavilions. We went in the afternoon and seemed to have missed out on the impressive night scene.",
          "The lake is within walking distance from Cheomgsongdae Observatory. There is admission fee (I think it is 3000 won) to enter the place. The pond is spectacular at night as the lights lit up the place. However during my visit, the earlier light rain became heavier so there were",
          "Do the night tour to really appreciate the beauty of this location and its amazing buildings. A truly unique experience that only Korea can provide.",
          "The little park with its lake, ruins and the few reconstructed buildings is a favourite spot for Koreans to go at sunset and in the evening. There is sufficient explanation in English about the ruins and the buildings but it is the view of the floodlit buildings over the water",
          "The place is calm and beautiful, and if you get here at sunset it becomes magical: the lights and buildings reflecting on the water are not to miss! It's perfect for a stroll just after or before dinner. Unfortunately most of it is reconstructed, so if you come here to see old",
          "There's not much to see here, but at night Anapji Pond looks amazing. The buildings are well light and the walking paths around them are very peaceful. This is a hot destination for local dates and are usually more couples than families, children, or grumpy tourists trying to",
          "We planned to visit this place around sunset but the rain did not allowed us to. We went next day around noon and it loses much of its appeal.",
          "A very nice park with ponds and pagodas, not free but worth it. You could walk around the whole park and take photos in 30min. The music was playing while we were there so it was quite soothing. It is in a walkable distance from other attractions in downtown.",
          "Sadly we missed this spot as everything is labeled for Woldji Pond. Don't be misled. Can see parts of the Lotus ponds without entering the paid area of the Pond.",
          "Anapji may not be the biggest sight (only 3 buildings are fully restored), but it's amazing nonetheless. The balance between the vegetation, the pond and the buildings is amazing, especially at night. The lighted buildings reflect in the water, which is both beautiful and",
          "This place must have been so marvelous in it's day. It's so scenic and beautiful. Some restoration needed but it'll be fantastic when they finish. The history is unique and so is the story of it's demise. Don't miss it!",
          "Go at nighttime, but bring a blanket because it is really windy and chilly at night in this time of year. There is a sign at the entrance that says the exact time they turn on the lights. It costs 2,000 won to enter.",
          "So much of South Korea has been rebuilt because of the Japanese and you can tell. This is one of those places. Although beautiful, it is on the newer side. It is small and might be better to see at night when it is all lit up.",
          "Please dont be offended by my review but I just cannot understand the good reviews of this place. Grass. A temple like building. A pond. Yes it has history. And if you use your imagination you can go back in time. But we were bitterly disappointed at making a special journey to",
          "We liked it as once explained it became clear that the function was to impress under Silla period on foreigners travelling to Gyeongju (capital for 900years) The shape of pond (Wolji) is taken off the landscape line of the East Sea or Japanese Sea. Thats pretty tricky to do but",
          "One of the great places that was a palace of Shilla dynasty. The perfect time to go is at the afternoon, where you can have the sunset time when everything has a magnificent lights during sunset. Highly recommended (!)",
          "Visited at the end of the morning session and was in rush, though managed to walk around the pond once and visited the 3 pavilion once. Reckon the night view would be much better! Shall come back once again if visiting the area again!",
          "We were a little disappointed with Gyeongju as the reconstruction meant there was a little of Shilla history left and the temples looked not too different to those in Seoul (which are from Joseon dynasty not Shilla). But this place was truly beautiful - we went at night and it",
          "Definitely must see if you're in the area. Not a very large place, but if you like a nice stroll in a former palace area (partly reconstructed, not everything is rebuilt though), strongly recommended. Entrance fee is not steep at 2000 KRW per adult.",
          "An experience you absolutely should not miss if you're in Gyeongju! Go just after sunset with all the buildings lit up and you will capture beautiful pictures even with your cellphone! We were there in April and there was an ajumma photography class there so it was a bit crowded",
          "I went to this pond as part of my visit to Gyeonju. Out of all places I visited, I might have liked this one best. Even though the pond is not that large, I spent several hours walking around it and sitting, looking at the fishes. I went during the day, but I've heard it is even",
          "A great place to enjoy an evening stroll around the pond. You will see the remains of korean traditional architecture. The lighting is beautiful at night.",
          "It's an okay attraction but a little underwhelming. There used to be a large complex here, next to an artificial lake amidst gardens. Currently, they have rebuilt three relatively small buildings and tended to the garden. One of the buildings has a model of how the grounds",
          "There's not a lot here, two or three reconstructed structures...but that's not to say this place isn't interesting. There is a model of what the entire palace looked like and, using that as a guide, while looking around the pond, it's great fun to imagine what it must have been",
          "Visit this attraction at night, when the reflection of the buildings in the mirror like pond makes for a surreal experience...",
          "Im honestly not a fan of asian traditional palaces so i dont get pretty much impress by them. I wouldnt call this destination a must but for people who love this palace (like my parents) its really really nice; one thing is true you HAVE to go at night or at least when the",
          "If you do one thing while in Gyeongju make sure you go here - A world UNESCO heritage site like most of the old city sites but this is easily the most amazing visually - make sure to go at twilight to get the best of it at day and night! Seeing the birds twirling overheard was",
          "Time your arrival for just before sunset for the best photo opportunities. The pond is spectacularly floodlit.",
          "You have to pay a ticket to get in and it is just three small buildings on the pond and a path leading around the pond for a better view of the gazebos. It was pretty to see at night, but from living in Asia for quite some time it was nothing spectacular. Overall, it is worth a",
          "i would recommend to visit Anapji pond both in the day and the night. The views are contrastingly beautiful for the different periods.",
          "I went there after the visit of the national museum (I basically needed to cross the street to get there) The site is open until 10pm and I went there around 7pm, when everything is under night lights - It worth it to see it and walk around the small lake",
          "it's easy to acces by car and very nice at night time for the perfect light system,,,avoid the cold days,,,it's freezing",
          "very cool promenade through a big park with nice lake and well reconstructed palaces. calm atmosphere",
          "Almost missed it cos we were tired and had 40 mins to closing time but this will be the reason I will visit Gyeongju again! As it was late almost 9:30pm we took a taxi which again was cheaper and faster than a bus since there was 3 of us (it took us right to the entrance), we",
          "I went there in December during a short holiday in the area. The scenery and the lighting after sunset is fantastic. I guess daytime it is nothing special but in the evening this is definitely a must destination. Parking is not a problem even though there are a lot of visitors",
          "Remember to visit Anapji Pond in the evening or at night. The sunset is just too beautiful and the lighting at night maked Anapji Pond an attractive one.",
          "If you have a romantic nature or enjoy taking moonlit photos, this your place. While not large, the evening views are exquisite. We went on a full moon and the entire park while small, was drop dead gorgeous.",
          "Supposed to be a palace/residential in the ancient times, but was burnt/ruined that only 3 important buildings were resurrected and kept. Worth a visit if you enjoy a walk, as the complex has a small park and pond around.",
          "It is a charming complex which impresses with its harmony. Maybe really not that much to see or take photos, but the energy of the place is worth of a visit.",
          "The view at night is impressive. The walk is not very long, but the lighting and the situation of the pavilions surrounded by the ponds give you a good chance to get postcard style photographs.",
          "One of the top must sees in Gyeongju, beautiful at night. It is a pond made for a king with 3 pavilions and a man-made island as well. Chilly in fall and winter so bring a jacket.",
          "To be honest, although ticket entrance is only a few S$ (very cheap), there is a reason why it is so cheap... There really isn't much to see at Anapji Pond except for the lightings itself. In fact, there are only that few \"palaces\"/\"pavilions\" that you ended up taking photos of",
          "Whether you go in the day, or at night, this is a beautiful place and should not be missed when visiting this town.",
          "I came here with a friend, we came at a bad time as despite the fact that it was nighttime as everyone comes at night to see the lights. They really are beautiful. The whole area is lit up beautifully and as you walk around you get to see it from lots of different view points.",
          "It's better to come here at night. More beautiful view with all the lights and its reflection on the water. A nice night walk activity in Gyeongju.",
          "Dream place. I wish to come back here for my honeymoon :) The place is really romantic, but you should come at night.",
          "One of the most beautiful historical parks I've ever visited. The layout, the bamboo trees, the remnants of the palace complex and their reflections in the pond are equally gorgeous. Arrived at late afternoon and luckily saw the night view as well. It has a very chilled-out yet",
          "Take bus #10 or 11 from train station and get off at the entrance. Lighting up the pond makes good pictures. Worthwhile to pay a visit for the night scene.",
          "This is a visually gorgeous place where you can end up taking too many photos just to get the right one. The pond is still as glass and the reflections are so perfect that it is nearly impossible to tell where the reflections start. Apart from the beautiful architectural",
          "The Pond and the surrounding buildings are being restored and rebuilt. At the moment it's a nice peaceful park. Could be skipped if one is pressed for time.",
          "To me, it is just another pond with beautiful lights at night. But consider there isn't much to do at night in chilly Gyeongju. It is a good place to be at night to kill some time.",
          "This was a lake in the palace of Shilla Dynassty. This is very famous for night views if the led lights on the walls are lit. Lots of photographers come to here to take pictures of night views of this place.",
          "If you are offended by people taking endless selfies the you are going to have a problem with the Anapji Pond. Good fun to wander around after dark, great atmosphere and lots of buzz from the other visitors. Helpful staff at the ticket machines at the entrance. Doesn't take too",
          "The pond and the rains of the palace are worth a visit. First: its a cute little place. Second the entry fee is cheap. The only draw back i have, is that the remaining palace complex consists of 3 buildings which resemble pavillions. BUT they do have nice reconstruction model",
          "We strolled around the pond at night and it was definitely worth going to. It was so beautiful. During the day I don't think it would be as majestic or beautiful so best to keep it for the night.",
          "Waste of time and not worth going. Just walking and strolling along the pond. Taking some photographs on the clear reflection. Nothing much to do. 10 to 20 mins is more than enough to explore this area.",
          "Wow simply just wow I was very impressed by this wonderful pond^^ \u263a\ud83d\ude0a\u263a\ud83d\ude0a it's peaceful its away from the city life and it's absolutely beautiful in the summer time^^",
          "Arrived after sunset and the pogodas were lit up it was beautiful but it was really really busy. You can walk around the lake but alas the amount of school trips put me off. Not complaining about the trips as its important for them. If in the area again i would go back again",
          "Anapji should be visited at night when the lights are lit and it's reflection of the pavilions and trees on the water are beautiful. During day time, it might be a just a tad boring. hehe",
          "It's a great short tour and I recommend the audio guide to explain the significance of many of the features of the pond and buildings. After visiting the Anapji Pond, you should go visit the National museum - they have an entire exhibition hall dedicated to the historical",
          "The pond is beautiful but small and the historic site it is located on is largely destroyed except for a few newly built buildings. Worth going to only as part of a walk through Gyeongju's historic area.",
          "A pavilion and a pond. I wish I could say more, but that's what you get when you go here. It's nice for a quick stroll followed by an equally expeditious departure.",
          "Donggung palace is at the heart of the Silla capital of Gyeongju; it is surrounded by Anpji Pond, an artificial lake created long after the palace was built. At night, the grounds are illuminated, making it one of the most beautiful sights in all of Korea. Donggung precedes the",
          "You will feel quite chilly after sunset but the lights that reflects the pond against the buildings were spectacular. Bring along a cardigan and good camera.",
          "A not-to-miss night view in Gyeongju. See the traditional Korean architectures and be amazed with the beautiful night view",
          "Great place to walk around the pond and enjoy quietly. Best hour to visit: early morning and near sunset, so you will enjoy the reflections on the pond surface.",
          "The area around the point is worth a visit for a nice stroll anyways. But when you visit when the sun has set the buildings and the point are nicely illuminated. A great sight. Gets busy on weekends.",
          "I came to Gyeongju in the afternoon so I tried to visit some places near the bus terminal. At first I thought it was just a walk for fresh air but it turned out a very interesting walk. After around 2 hours walk through Daereungwon park and Cheomseongdae observatory, I reached",
          "Great stop on a quick sightseeing visit to area. Well maintained and lots of nice displays and exhibits available.",
          "If you are spending at least two nights in Gyeongju I thoroughly recommend you take a stroll ever here one evening. You can pass by the oil seed fields next to the town on the way around sunset. There are some lovely pagodas but the way they are reflected in the lake is",
          "Visited at around sunset. View was really pretty and we took a nice stroll around the area. It's actually called wolji pond though. Heard it's much prettier at night after the sun sets.",
          "Nice enough place, but it's really just a pond, and there's not much left of the associated buildings.",
          "My host Mr. Park called this Wolpi Pond. He took us there one evening to see it with lights. It's really intended to be a place to visit and relax and enjoy the traditional architecture of Korea in a pleasant setting. Water is very important to the scene and pavilions raised",
          "This is a fabulous place to visit on a clear, windless night when the reflections are at their best. The whole place has a lovely atmosphere. Take an hour to stroll around the grounds and don't forget your camera.",
          "This pond used to be a place where the King and Queen seek pleasure when in Donggung Palace. However, it was burned in 935 and many relics ended up in the pond itself, to be rediscovered only when it was drained for repair in 1975. Thousands of relics were recovered including a",
          "Nice park for a evening walk. The pond is beautifully lit and creates a magical atmosphere. We were there on a Saturday night and it was very crowded.",
          "I have travelled to a lot of places in Korea but this is probably the most impressive building I have seen so far. It is simply amazing the view at night of the buildings all lit up and overlooking the pond. I'm sure that the view during the day would be stunning too but you",
          "Visit this place at night. It lends to an awesome atmosphere at night, during the day its ok but it comes alive at night. Very romantic.",
          "Right after sunset seems to be the ideal time to go, but I guess this is obvious to everyone as the place was seriously overrun with hordes of kids on class trips. What would otherwise have been a peaceful and serene setting was actually unbearably noisy. However, once I figured",
          "Really is a special place after dark when the lighting of the pavilions can be seen to best effect. On a till evening in April I had the privilege of experiencing the beauty of the park floodlit which also enhanced the cherry blossom in full bloom.",
          "While almost all of the Anapji pond with its buildings are remade from the ground up, the effort taken by Korean authorities to show the ancient Silla culture is amazing. The pond gives a good feeling of how it must have been 12 centuries ago. Take a walk around the pond and get",
          "I found this place as normal. Nothing really special. If you have time and loves walking, I suggest to walk around the park nearby. Or visit the folk craft village.",
          "This place is extremely better to see at night (go just before sun set so you can see the difference). Although it is not a huge place and can be seen within 30 minutes, to see it lit up at night and the reflections in the still water makes for an even better experience. Also",
          "The Anapji Pond is beautiful after nightfall. The lights are set so that the trees and houses are reflected in the pond, and it is magical. We walked around the whole pond and must have taken hundreds of pictures. There is also a small exhibit in the main house about the",
          "Not a must see sight but it is romantic the way it is lit up at night. The pond has historical value as well. Coming at sunset would be the perfect time to get day and night views.",
          "This place is very beautiful at night. With a good lighting. Make sure to bring a tripod to take a good picture here. A must place to visit.",
          "Very beautifully lit up, I can recommend going there during nighttime! It was very crowded though. Located close to the National Museum and the Astronomical tower.",
          "nothing much to see here, just a large pond and some traditional buildings but historically it is so important. it was about 40 years ago they excavated about 33,000 objects from the pond which being thrown away 1000 year ago when the fire gutted the original buildings .the mud",
          "2000 won entrance fee. Visited on a blue sky day and I was underwhelmed. The lake was fine, but I go for the photos. With the metal railings and bland surroundings it was tricky to get any 'new' or pleasant angles. Even with few visitors! Possibly better at night, although there",
          "I went during the day so it was extraordinarily hot. It's in a great location because it's around a lot of cheap or free attractions. Entrance is 2,000won. Easy to reach by bicycle from the city center. I suggest going before sunset so you can see it during the day and at",
          "visited this place at daytime and also at nite, The nite view is really wonderful with the lights lit up along the whole place.",
          "This is the most beautiful place I've seen in Korea. Go at sunset and stay to see the pavilions enlightened at night. The reflections of them in the pond are simply awesome, a delicacy for your eyes. Entrance fee affordable (2000 wons) Don't be scary of the frogs, they can jump",
          "Yes, it's just a walk through some gardens. But I loved it. It's a great relaxing stop. If you've been to the Gyeongju National Museum, you can easily walk here. Just go back out to the main road and turn left. You'll get to Anapji in about ten minutes. I actually loved that",
          "I thought this area would be really beautiful but the pond is actually quite small and the buildings surrounding it are clearly reconstructions so one looses the sense of history as well. Maybe at night it looks better we visited during the day, but I would not come here again.",
          "not a big pond but well managed place for visit. many people loves the night time visit, because it is beautibul also under the lighting and reflection of buildings over the pond at night",
          "The visit consists of a walking tour around the pond. The best time to visit is at sunset. The parking space is huge but come 30 minutes before sunset if you want to park easily. A must do!",
          "This a large garden complex centered around the Anapji pond that the Silla royalty used to relax and entertain. The main pavillion lit up at night is the one you see in all the tourist brochures. In the day it is quite ordinary but does provide a place from which to see some",
          "Others are right don't go on a rainy day there is little cover and thus you will get wet. To be honest probably not good on a wet night either, sounds like summer evenings are the time.",
          "We visited here on the first day of summer and it was very hot. The grounds are tranquil and a pleasant walk with plenty of shade and places to rest. We were told it is much better to visit at dusk because the place is lit up, but unfortunately we didn't make it back. I would",
          "I personally fall in love in Anapji when I snapped the photo of pond and building which has reflection that was so nice. Be here before sunset, grab a nice spot and set your camera ready. You won't disappoint about the scene that was so nice. If you not sure where the best spot,",
          "for a visit to Anapji Pond. This former Silla Dynasty palace site has been expertly restored, and more than adequately captures the opulence of the ruling class during this time period. Also interesting to observe are the irrigation / drain structures. Definitely take the",
          "Try and visit at dusk. As the lights come on the reflections of the pavilions in the pond are lovely.",
          "Visited during the earlier onset of winter. The best time to go to Anapji Pond is during the evening. With the sun set, the surrounding areas are colourfully lite and the reflection of the lights over the pond create a lovely scenery.",
          "it has wondreful view at night time than day time. and lake in there is so nice",
          "This is a very peaceful and serene place. It was very pretty and full of ducks on the pond. It was part of the main palace at one time. You can visit in less than an hour unless you want to hang out and soak in the serenity or read a book or something like that.",
          "I was not able to visit Anapji at night due to some hick-ups during the trip. So, I went there in the morning, after visiting the Museum . It was the last Gyeongju attraction I visited before heading to the train station back to Busan. At the left of the gate, there are staff",
          "Go at night - it was beautiful. We got there right before closing time (which was at 9:30 - last tickets). I would love to see what it all looks like in winter, but fall is the best time to see it I think.",
          "Anapji is far more than a pond, though that is the description given here. As it was described to me by my Korean friend, it is a place that Royalty would entertain. By night the pavilions are lit up and make for spectacular photos. Bring your tripod, bring your patience... the",
          "IT was recommended to me to visit Anapji at night because it looked more beautiful with the reflections in the water and the lights on. I didn't get to see it during the day so I can't really compare, but it didn't look pretty cool at night. The only thing that was off putting",
          "I visited anapji pond last year during april ,i went there about 7pm,atmosphere at that time was good and it was beautiful with all the lighting on,it was relaxing to just take a slow walk around that place but if your camera is not for night scene then you may capture not so",
          "This place was discovered with many relics of 7, 8 century AD. The three restored Silla dynasty building are surrounded by pond. It takes about 30 minutes to look around. The old place, that's all.",

          "Went there with my wife and my son, all area accessable for stroller. Is one of the most beautiful site in Gyeongju. Should be more scenic in the height of autumn when all the maples starts to turn into bright yellow and red.",
          "Lighted traditional buildings and gardens reflected in the extensive pond gave a lovely hushed atmosphere even though there were many other people there, walking around the pond.",
          "It was the palace for banquet or reception of ancient Silla. In this lake(or pond), very interesting dice that was written penalty in party(very similar with present one.. singing.. drinking alcohol..dancing)was found. The huge dice In front of Entrance is the model of this",
          "After seeing the miniature of the glory of the park at the National Museum. There is not much except the rebuilt of 3 of the houses and the pond. For us it doesn't worth the 2000 won. But we heard that it is nice by night, may be, Korea is really good on putting lights all over.",
          "It's good to go there at night. There's Lotus garden near the place. It's historical landmark and also great scenery at the same time.",
          "It's a nice place. I recommend stopping by on your cycling tour around Gyeongju, it would be a good lunch spot.",
          "Side of an old palace and a pond. Night view is great. However, with such a crowd, we had to follow a line around the pond.",
          "Very beautiful, manicured, and mostly reconstructed. The Pond isn't clean, but there is a mini water fall that is which leads into it. We kept wondering if there were any fish in it because of how murky it was. Part of the reason I think I liked it so much was because it had",
          "Crowded at night because I think everyone know it looks attractive at night. The reflection of the building and the plants surrounding it are the main attraction.",
          "This is one of my favorite places to go at night. There are lights all around and when the weather is cool you can enjoy walking around the ponds. Its a place to get away from the traffic and just drift away. I like how the lights bounce off the pond and its a great place to",
          "Recommend you to come here at night. And you will see the beautiful reflection on the pond. The lightning is really awesome and bring a romantic atmosphere. My Korean friend told me a lot of couple come to hang out.",
          "I went there at a winter night. It was very cold but the lighting arrangement were brilliant. This is a good place to take wonderful photos, especially if you go there as a couple",
          "Don't miss the lotus ponds at the south side, the lotuses go on for ever. This is a pleasant place to look at three separate pavilions overlooking the small lake; you can enter only one of them. It is restful and charming.",
          "Not really much to see. The surrounding water lilies OUTSIDE...free was a more spectacular attraction. Go to the national museum instead. Since all the artefacts from the wohlji pond are now exhibited in the museum.",
          "My friends and I went to Anapji Pond on our first night in Gyeongju. The lights were nice especially as the lights from the temples reflected the pond. It was a great experience.",
          "Might be nicer in the Spring. Pleasant setting but the foundation walls supporting buildings have too much of a poured concrete look. If you have time to burn stop by but if pressed for time then pass on this visit.",
          "This place is the zen garden of zen gardens,A must see if in the area.They pipe in traditional music throughout the complex and its a great way to spend an afernoon hiking around the grounds,then finish the day by going to the museum just across the street.",
          "It's a beautiful place as a park. Pity not all the pavilions are open and accessible. Save another family, we had it to ourselves on a Monday.",
          "If you're a photographer, Anapji is the perfect spot to catch the \"magic hour.\" Sure my photos are probably identical to the myriad other ones already on the webernets. But that doesn't make them any less special on a personal level. My advice is to get a good spot well before",
          "My wife and I loved how beautiful Anapji looks in the evening when it's all lit up. We would often catch our breath while we gazed at the next stunningly lit pavilion and its reflection in the water. Then we'd step out of the way as hordes of schoolchildren plowed by us,",
          "Awesome night shows.Love to see you try to go in the evening. Cherry blossoms bloom in early April, once head ^ ^",
          "I never went during daytime, but we visited at night and it was amazing! It was one of the most beautiful things we saw. And entrance is almost free too. Very romantic :)",
          "We rented some bikes (really cheap) and rode to the lake. There are some really lovely sights both traveling to and going around the lake.",
          "Beautiful park. Be sure to visit at night when everything is lit up. A popular place for couples and groups of teenagers.",
          "I loved Anapji pond. We went at night time as you can see everything lit up and it is really beautiful. It is located just outside of Gyeongju so you need to take a bus or a taxi. We were waiting quite a while for a bus as only certain ones go past there. It gets rediculously",

          "Anapji Pond is a very beautiful part of the quaint and green Gyeongju. Like others have mentioned tou can cycle all around the city, so make this a stop and enjoy the natural beauty and calm. Try to come when there are less tourists. I recommend going in autumn when the leaves",
          "The area is not very huge, so great to visit and have an evening walk in the evening when the place are light up.",
          "The pond is very beautiful and great if you like to take pictures. It's a very popular place for Korean people to visit so it's always busy. There also almost no information about the history of the pond, which I think is very interesting so you should read up on it before",
          "Anapji pond is a must when visiting Gyeongju. The thing about this city is that you can pretty much bike around all the famous sites in the city area. It is also quite safe so I recommend biking or walking to Anapji to beat the crowd. This place really is magical. You can really",
          "We viewed this 3 times. Once as we passed by bus in autumn so lotus floweres were yellowing and fading. Then at night when the palaces nearby were lit up, and we spotted a night heron coming in to roost, then finally by bicycle in the day. Story associated with the pond is very",
          "A magical place at night with the buildings and trees reflected in the pond. This is a must see. The best time is probably in the Autumn when the temperatures are lower and the trees begin to change colour.",
          "Anapji in the evening was full of couples, holding hands but if you're alone or with a family, there's not much else to see. The pond is nice and the few remaining structures are lit up but otherwise it's just a stop. I went through the entire thing in less than an hour. If",
          "This is a very well maintained pond. There is a lot of open space as well. I walked around the pond and took a lot of pictures. The place is gorgeous! I went on a weekday as well, so less people.",
          "Beautiful and peaceful. Go in late evening for a perfect walk so you can see it lit up (as shown in many of the pictures above).",
          "When there aren't many tourists, you can experience this place like the royals did with a nice, serene walk around the pond, which can be a nice break if you're rushing around to see things.",
          "Anapji Pond is one of my favorite places to go to in Korea. Having several of the old pavilions reconstructed, it adds to the charm of the park. The grounds are beautiful, no matter what time of the year you go. If you need a relaxing day whilst backpacking through Korea, this",

          "We went in the evening and the place is just amazing. The lighting is lovely. It's all a little cheesy, but if you can just relax and switch off, then it's a great place to chill. Would be excellent on a date, it's very romantic. The pond is probably the highlight, there are",
          "Best to see when the lotus blossoms are blooming. They blossoms open up in the morning, like 7am, then close for the day...so wake up early and take some amazing photo's!",
          "We went to Anapji Pond in the evening, the lighting they have set up really brings the place to life and makes for some beautiful views of the water and structures. There isn't a whole load of historical information to see at the site, so it's probably worth taking a trip to",
          "This is another one of the \"quick stop\" places to see in Gyeongju. The site is best appreciated if you visit the National Museum first and see some artifacts from the area as well as models of what the palace looked like. What's left today is pretty much just the pond and the",

          "I haven't heard of Donggung in Kyongju...but it was Anapji where I have visited before. I was wondering why the government changed its name. This pond is still beautiful and peaceful regardless of the name.",

The region usually forms the similar political, economic, and cultural area. Daegu is an independent city from Gyeongsangbuk-do and has the same administrative status with its mother province. Both have their separate local governments reporting directly to the national government.\nIn addition to the foremost city Daegu, there are many cities in this region including Pohang the major port and steel industrial city, Gumi the electronics industrial city, Gyeongju and Andong as the historic cities.\nWith a population of 5.1 million, the region has about one tenth of South Korea's population and GDP. It also has the country's third largest metropolitan area centering the Daegu city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHistorically, the region was the birthplace of the Silla Kingdom. With Gyeongju as the capital, it first unified the Korean Peninsula and prospered for about thousand years. It left a number of remains around the city, which are listed as a World heritage site by UNESCO.\nIn the Goryeo and Joseon Dynasty, it formed the northern half of Gyeongsang-do. Its name is from Gyeong of Gyeongju and Sang of Sangju, the two largest cities at that time. In the latter part of Joseon, it became home to the Korean Confucianism. Many cultural assets can be seen throughout the region including Andong. The Hahoe village of Andong and Yangdong village of Gyeongju are designated as the World heritages. From around the time, Daegu became the commercial center of the region. The provincial capital moved to Daegu in 1601.\nThe current boundary of the region was first defined with the name of Gyeongsangbuk-do in 1896, the year when Gyeongsang-do was divided into Gyeongsangbuk-do and Gyeongsangnam-do. It had the largest population in the country until its division in 1981, when Daegu separated from Gyeongsangbuk-do. After more than four hundred years at Daegu, Gyeongsangbuk-do's provincial office moved to Andong in 2016.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "I came here on a night tour from the tourist information centre at the Gyeongju bus station. I found this observatory of moderate interest, but the guide\u2019s narration in Korean only so I probably missed much of its significance.",

          "I wasn't sure how interesting Cheomseongdae would be for me, but it was close to some other things we were visiting so we went for a quick look. The tower is really beautiful in person, especially at night when it's lit up. It really is an interesting piece of history and it's",
          "Our guide was not able to park along the road to visit the observatory, but I was able to take a photo only from afar. There were lots of tourists and cars, so I was able to stay and take photos from afar only for 10 minutes or so with my family. But along the road, there were",
          "This is a historic star gazing tower built in 7th century by Queen Seondeok. It is probably the oldest star gazing tower in East Asia. Worth a visit!",

          "The building itself is very unique in shape and definitely is an important part of Korean history. More could have been placed at the site to explain the significance and some of the resulting discoveries. Otherwise, all you have is a cool looking building.",
          "I wasn't overly impressed with the visual of this place but the reason behind it being built is quite amazing! If you are visiting the tomb mounds then by all means walk by the observatory.",
          "You can\u2019t really miss this ancient observatory when you visit Gyeongju. Make sure you visit it both during the day and in the evening (before nine) because it looks quite different",

          "Some may say.. it's just a small tower but you need to dive in that time .. 7th century and think about the observation they made.. pretty impressive",
          "This was a very interesting stop. We spend an hour going around the park like facility. The signs are dual lauange which is very helpful.",
          "A very very old monument which was known as an ancient observatory, but still under debate what it really is. Not of a big size, but it's one of the representative sight in Gyeongju.",
          "While I understand the historical significance of this place, the entire observatory just feels a little underwhelming. It's really just one brick structure in the middle of the park. There is a simple info board to tell you what the structure is about, but that's about it. You",

          "This is pretty much original dating back 1500 years of so and was used as an observatory at that time. Worth seeing in an area with many interesting structures",
          "To visit this takes not a lot of time. You can walk around it in a matter of a few minutes But it is better to understand it Alongside is a small booth which has lots of info on video fashion in different languages. We recommend that you see this first as it will make the walk",
          "Our guesthouse was right near the park, so we were able to see the observatory often, as visitors to the park and while walking along the street. We gained greater appreciation for it after going to the Gyeongju Museum. Still not sure how the observatory, but we value what the",

It doesn\u2019t brag or bombastically shout out \u201cI\u2019m the best!!!\u201d. It just stands there, with vigor. And that is why I love this.",
          "The observatory stems from the 7th century and is beautifully integrated in the stunning Tumuli park.We did not count, but were told that the building contains 12 carved stones for the base, 365 stones in total and that the roof contains 4 stones. More questions?",

          "The tower itself may look small and simple but don't let it's mere form deceive you in what it actually represents. CheomSeongDae is the oldest, surviving astronomical observatory throughout all of Asia. I read an article somewhere stating that it might even be one of the first",
          "Ancient structure from Shilla period. It is quite small in size, my friend said that it looks like a ketchup bottle. It is nice to take picture from the flower garden. Observe contrast between day time view and night time view because it will be coloured with yellow light at",
          "Last autumn, I visited Gyeongju. The city itself had different atmosphere and I felt as if I was in the centre of the past when my ancestors lived. In particular, I felt something strange without any reasons in front of the observatory. The night view was better for me.",

          "This is one of the oldest astronomical platforms in Asia. But though I asked could not find a reason for it being there or why they would need a raised tower like this at all.",
          "Built at the request of a female Queen, this observatory was used to study the stars and align with the sun for the solstice. It is in a nice setting. When I was there, there were masses of poppies in bloom. An easy walk from the tomb mounds next to the observatory.",

          "If you are already in the area, this place is worth a stop. You can dress up in traditional Shilla dynasty clothes for free and snap a few pictures. There is not much depth in history and information. It left me longing for more history about why it was built and how it was",
          "We visited during the cherry blossom season. The fields were covered with yellow rapeseed and together with the pink cherry blossoms and the mountain in the background, made for beautiful photos. However the Observatory itself was rather unimpressive. I would have found it",
          "Loved the surrounding areas with flowers / cherry blossom trees. It is a good area for night shots also as the area is lit up at night.",
          "This was one of the major things we came all the way to Gyeongju to see. I don't know what we were expecting to be honest but we were pretty underwhelmed. Something about it just translates well into pictures and falls flat in real life. Looks like a stack of bricks with a hole",
          "When we were planning the trip before we left, I did not put this on the list of places to visit while in Gyeongju. We stumbled across it as we were walking towards the Daereungwon Tomb Complex. I actually found it quite interesting and would recommend a quick stop. Definitely",
          "Nice to rent a bike for a day and cycle around the park where the observatory is. Some people were renting traditional korean costumes to post for pictures too, but we didn't try. There are lots of bike shops around. We took 5 bikes and the shop gave us a discount at only KRW",
          "If you are expecting to see something really mind blowing, this may not be the place you would want to visit. However, if you are interested in historic significance, this place is a must go. To imagine how this structure was built 1000 years ago, and still stands put in spite",
          "If you are expecting lots to do and see, this is the wrong place. Located opposite the burial tombs of Cheonmacheong (you can either visit this before or after the observatory - we chose before.. so we started at Cheonmacheong tombs --> observatory --> Gyeongju Museum --> Anapji",
          "I believe the observatory is technically in Gyeongju National Park. I understand its historical significance, but there is not much to see of this observatory. You can only walk outside of it as it's a small observatory. It is only 9m tall, made of stone, and there's not much",

        "wiki": "Daegu (Korean: [t\u025b\u0261u]; \ub300\uad6c, \u5927\u90b1, literally 'large hill'\ub300\uad6c\uad11\uc5ed\uc2dc), formerly spelled Taegu and officially known as the Daegu Metropolitan City, is a city in South Korea, the fourth-largest after Seoul, Busan, and Incheon and the third-largest metropolitan area in the nation with over 2.5 million residents. Also, it is the second largest city in the Yeongnam region after Busan. However, it is the fourth city in terms of population after Seoul, Busan and Incheon. It was overtaken by Incheon in the 2000s, but still it is said to be the third city according to the \"Act on the Establishment of Daegu City and Incheon City\" (Act No. 3424 and April 13, 1981). Daegu and surrounding North Gyeongsang Province are often referred to as Daegu-Gyeongbuk, with a total population over 5 million. \nDaegu is located in south-eastern Korea about 80 km (50 mi) from the seacoast, near the Geumho River and its mainstream, Nakdong River in Gyeongsang-do. The Daegu basin is the central plain of the Yeongnam region. In ancient times, the Daegu area was part of the proto-kingdom Jinhan. Subsequently, Daegu came under the control of the Silla Kingdom, which unified the Korean Peninsula. During the Joseon Dynasty period, the city was the capital of Gyeongsang-do, one of the traditional eight provinces of the country.\nDaegu was an economic motor of Korea during the 1960s\u20131980s period and was especially known for its electronics industry. The humid subtropical climate of Daegu is ideal for producing high-quality apples, thus the nickname, \"Apple City\". Daegu is also known as \"Textile City\". Textiles used to be the pillar industry of the city. With the establishment of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone, Daegu is currently focusing on fostering fashion and high-tech industries.\nDaegu was the host city of the 22nd World Energy Congress, the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, and the 2003 Summer Universiade. It also hosted four matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory and early history ===\nArchaeological investigations in the Greater Daegu area have revealed a large number of settlements and burials of the prehistoric Mumun Pottery Period (around 1500\u2013300 BC). In fact, some of the earliest evidence of Mumun settlement in Gyeongsangdo have been excavated from Siji-dong and Seobyeon-dong. Dongcheon-dong is one of the substantial Mumun agricultural villages that have been excavated. The Dongcheon-dong site dates back to the Middle Mumun (around 850\u2013550 BC) and contains the remains of many prehistoric pit-houses and agricultural fields. Megalithic burials (dolmens) have also been found in large numbers in Daegu.\nAncient historical texts indicate that during the Proto\u2013Three Kingdoms (Mahan, Jinhan, and Byeonhan) period, Daegu was the site of a chiefdom or walled-town polity known from that time, according to historical records, as Dalgubeol. It was absorbed into the kingdom of Silla no later than the fifth century. The vestiges of the wall can be seen, and relics have been excavated in the current Dalseong Park.\n\n\n=== Silla ===\nSilla succeeded in unifying the Korean peninsula by defeating the other kingdoms of Baekje and Koguryo in the late seventh century, partly due to assistance from China's Tang Dynasty. Shortly thereafter, in 689, Silla's King Sinmun considered moving the capital from Gyeongju to Daegu, but was unable to do so.  This initiative is known only through a single line in the Samguk Sagi, a most valued historical record of ancient Korea by Koryeo Dynasty historian Kim Bu-sik, but it is presumed to indicate both an attempt by the Silla king to reinforce royal authority and the entrenched resistance of the Gyeongju political elites that was the likely cause of the move's failure. The city was given its current name in 757.\nIn the late 1990s, archaeologists excavated a large-scale fortified Silla site in Dongcheon-dong, Buk-gu. The site at Locality 2 consists of the remains of 39 raised-floor buildings enclosed by a formidable ditch-and-palisade system. The excavators hypothesize that the fortified site was a permanent military encampment or barracks. Archaeologists also uncovered a large Silla village dating to the sixth to seventh centuries AD at Siji-dong.\n\n\n=== Later Three Kingdoms and Goryeo ===\nDuring the Later Three Kingdoms period, 892\u2013936, Daegu was initially aligned with Hubaekje. In 927, northern Daegu was the site of the Battle of Gong Mountain between the forces of Goryeo under Wang Geon and those of Hubaekje under Gyeon Hwon. In this battle, the forces of Goryeo were crushed and Wang Geon himself was saved only by the heroic deed of his general Shin Sung-gyeom. However,  the atrocities of the Hubaekje forces at this time apparently changed local sympathizers to favor Wang Geon, who later became the king of Goryeo.\nNumerous place names and local legends in the area still bear witness to the historic battle of 927. Among these are \"Ansim\", which literally means \"peace of mind\", said to be the first place where Wang Geon dared to stop after escaping the battle, and \"Banwol\", or half-moon, where he is said to have stopped and admired the moon before returning to Goryeo. A statue commemorating the battle now stands in northern Daegu, as does a memorial to Sin Sunggyeom.\nIn the Goryeo period, the first edition of the Tripitaka Koreana was stored in Daegu, at the temple of Buinsa.  However, this edition was destroyed when the temple was sacked in 1254, during the Mongol invasions of Korea.\n\n\n=== Joseon ===\n\nDaegu served as an important transportation center during the Joseon Dynasty. She stands in the mid part of the Great Yeongnam Road which ran between Seoul and Busan. It lay at the junction of this arterial road and the roads to Gyeongju and Jinju.\nIn 1601, Daegu became the administrative capital of the Gyeongsang-do, which is current Daegu, Busan, Ulsan, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and Gyeongsangnam-do. At about that time, the city began to grow into a major city. The status continued for nearly 300 years, and the city has been transformed as the capital of Gyeongsangbuk-do since Gyeongsang-do was divided into two provinces, Gyeongsangbuk-do (northern Gyeongsang-province) and Gyeongsangnam-do (southern one) in 1896.\nDaegu's first regular markets were established during the late Joseon period. The most famous of these is the Yangnyeongsi herbal medicine market. This became a center of herbal trade in Joseon, and even attracted buyers from neighboring countries. Traders from Japan, who were not permitted to leave the Nakdong River valley, hired messengers to visit the market on their behalf. Seomun Market, which stood at the city's west gate at that time, was one of the top-three markets in the Joseon period.\n\n\n=== Korean Empire and colonial rule ===\nThe Korean hermit kingdom finally opened itself to the outside world in the late 19th century. In 1895, Daegu became the site of one of the country's first modern post offices, as a part of the 'Gab-o' reforms introduced in the aftermath of the Sino-Japanese war.Beginning in the late 1890s, increasing numbers of foreign merchants and workers started to visit Daegu, which emerged as a modern transportation center of the newly constructed Gyeongbu Line main railroad connecting Seoul and Busan.\nIn 1905, the old fortress wall was forcibly destroyed. The wall still survives only in the street names such as the streets Dongseongno and Bukseongno, \"east fortress street\" and \"north fortress street\", which now run where the wall once stood.\nIndependence movements against imperial aggressions were outstanding in Daegu. These began as early as 1898, when a branch of the Independence Club was opened in the town.  As the demise of the Korean Empire approached in 1907, local citizens led by Seo Sang-don organized the National Debt Repayment Movement. The movement spread nationwide, although it fell short of repaying the national debt through individual donations. Freedom fighting continued after the 1910 annexation, notably during the March 1st movement of 1919. At that time, four major demonstrations took place in Daegu, involving an estimated 23,000 peace-loving citizens.\n\n\n=== After 1945 ===\nIn 1946, the Daegu October Incident took place, one of the most serious social disorders since the foundation of the Republic of Korea. An operation by the Korean national police to take control of rioters on October 1 resulted in the death of three student demonstrators and injuries to many others, sparking a massive counter-attack, killing as many as 38 policemen. It was also the site of major demonstrations on February 28, 1960, prior to the presidential election of that year.Daegu and all of North Gyeongsang province had heavy guerrilla activities in the late 1940s, as thousands of refugees shied away from the fighting in Jeolla province and sought shelters in Daegu.  In November 1948, a unit in Daegu joined the mutiny which had begun in Yeosu the previous month.During the Korean War, heavy fighting occurred nearby along the Nakdong River. Daegu sat inside the Pusan Perimeter, however, so remained in South Korean hands throughout the war. As in many other areas during the Korean War, political killings of dissenters were widespread. A large series of engagements was fought around the city to prevent North Korean troops from crossing the Nakdong, the Battle of Taegu.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the city underwent explosive growth, and the population has increased more than tenfold since the end of the Korean War. The city was politically favored during the 18-year-long rule of Park Chung-hee, when it and the surrounding area served as his political base. Daegu champions conservative political ideas and movements today and is a political base for the Saenuri Party.\nIn the 1980s, Daegu separated from Gyeongsangbuk-do and became a separately administered provincial-level directly governed city (Jikhalsi), and was redesignated as a metropolitan city (Gwangyeoksi) in 1995. Today, Daegu is the third-largest metropolitan area in Korea with respect to both population and commerce.\nIn February 2020, Daegu became known for the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nTwo local governments are in the city, the Daegu Metropolitan Government in Jung District and Gyeongbuk Provincial Government in Buk District. The provincial government will be relocated to Andong in its proper province, Gyeongbuk. The mayor and heads of city's eight districts are directly elected by the citizens every four years. The city council has 29 members which consist of 26 from the same number of electoral districts and three proportional representations. They are also directly elected every four years. Most of them are the members of the Liberty Korea Party, the main conservative political party in South Korea. Daegu is a stronghold for the party and has produced two Presidents of the Republic of Korea thus far: Roh Tae-woo and Park Geun-hye. As the capital of the Korean conservatives, the city has wielded strong political influence in elections.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nDaegu is divided into 7 districts (Gu) and 1 county (Gun)\n\nJung District (\uc911\uad6c, \u4e2d\u5340) \u2013 means the central district.\nDong District (\ub3d9\uad6c, \u6771\u5340) \u2013 means the east district.\nSeo District (\uc11c\uad6c, \u897f\u5340) \u2013 means the west district.\nNam District (\ub0a8\uad6c, \u5357\u5340) \u2013 means the south district.\nBuk District (\ubd81\uad6c, \u5317\u5340) \u2013 means the north district.\nSuseong District (\uc218\uc131\uad6c, \u58fd\u57ce\u5340)\nDalseo District (\ub2ec\uc11c\uad6c, \u9054\u897f\u5340)\nDalseong County (\ub2ec\uc131\uad70, \u9054\u57ce\u90e1)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nDaegu sits in a basin surrounded by low mountains. Palgongsan to the north, Biseulsan to the south, Waryongsan to the west, and a series of smaller hills in the east. The Geumho River flows along the northern and eastern edges of the city, emptying in the Nakdong River west of the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDaegu has a cooler version of a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa). In Holdridge climate classification, Daegu has a warm temperate moist forest climate. The mountains that comprise the basin trap hot and humid air. Similarly, in winter, cold air lies in the basin. The area receives little precipitation except during the rainy season of summer, and is sunny throughout much of the year. Data gathered since 1961 indicates that the mean temperature for January, the coldest month in Daegu, is 0.6 \u00b0C (33 \u00b0F) and that for August, the warmest month, is 26.4 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F). The City's lowest record temperature was \u221220.2 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F), and the City's highest record temperature was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F). The 40 degrees Celsius recorded in 1942 is also the highest temperature record in South Korea since the observation. This summer temperature has led to the emergence of a new term called Dae-Prika (Daegu+Africa) starting with the Internet community, and has recently been used in the media, broadcasting, etc. \n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nDaegu is a manufacturing industry city. The major industries are textiles, metals and machinery. In the year 2010, Daegu had a regional GDP of $45,387 million with 7.2% real GDP growth rate. The GDP per capita though is well below Korea national average. Many companies such as Daegu Bank, Korea Delphi, Hwasung corp., and TaeguTec are situated in this city, and Samsung and Kolon were founded here. Numerous factories are located in the industrial complexes situated in the west and north sides of the city including the Seongseo Industrial Complex, West Daegu Industrial Complex and the Daegu Dyeing Industrial Complex.\nThe city is the economic and industrial core of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk region, one of the major industrial areas in Korea. It accounted for as much as 94 percent of Korea's trade surplus in 2006. The electronics industries in Gumi and the steel industries in Pohang provided great services to that surplus. World-leading manufacturing facilities for Anycall (Samsung Mobile) and POSCO's main factories are located near the city. Daegu and its neighbouring cities were designated for the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone by the central government in 2008. It is specialized companies like Winitech software company in knowledge-based service and manufacturing industries.\nHistorically, Daegu has been the commercial center of the southern part of the Korean Peninsula with Seoul in the center and Pyongyang in the north (currently North Korea), because of its advantageous location. Some of the large, traditional markets like Seomun Market are still flourishing in the city.\nAdditionally, Daegu was considered the third major economic city in Korea, after Seoul and Busan. However, due to the decline of the textile industry, which is the heart of Daegu's economy, the overall economic growth of the city has also fallen.\nAlso, the city is the warmest region in South Korea due to the humid subtropical climate. This climate condition provides the region with high quality apples and oriental melons. The fruit industry is a crucial support for the local economy. Due to the stagnant economy, Daegu's population began to decrease after 2003. Recently, the local government has begun focusing on working towards economic revival and concentrating on improving the city's fashion industry.\n\n\n=== Fashion industry ===\nBeginning in the late 1990s, Daegu has been actively making efforts to promote its fashion industry based on its textile and clothing manufacturing industries under the 'Daegu: Fashion City'. The city opens many exhibitions related to the fashion and textile industries including the Daegu Fashion Fair and Preview in Daegu annually or semi-annually, and invites national institutes. A large new town specializing in the textile-fashion industries is currently under construction in Bongmu-dong, northeastern Daegu. The district, officially named Esiapolis, takes aim at the fashion hub of East Asia. Textile complexes, textile-fashion institutions, an international school, fashion malls as well as residential areas plan to be developed in the district.\n\n\n== Culture and sightseeing ==\n\nGenerally Daegu is known as a conservative city. As well as being the largest inland city in the country beside Seoul it has become one of the major metropolitan areas in the nation. Traditionally, Buddhism has been strong; today there are still many temples. Confucianism is also popular in Daegu, with a large academy based in the city. Neon cross-topped spires of Christian churches can also be seen in the city.\n\n\n=== Sights ===\nThe most well-known sight of the city is the stone Buddha called Gatbawi on the top of Gwanbong, Palgongsan. It is famous for its stone gat (Korean traditional hat). People from all over the country visit the place, because they believe that the Buddha will grant one's single desire. Administratively, the site itself is located in the neighboring city, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk.\n\nOn the outskirts of the city, mountains keep many traditional temples such as Donghwasa, Pagyesa, and Buinsa. Donghwasa is a Buddhist temple that was built by Priest Geukdal-hwasang in 493, and many artifacts of the period are found around the temple. The International Tourist Zen Meditation Center is Korea's only Zen-themed center. Some lecture halls or memorial halls such as Dodong-seowon (\ub3c4\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9053\u6771\u66f8\u9662) and Nokdong-seowon (\ub179\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9e7f\u6d1e\u66f8\u9662) are also located in the suburbs.\nOld villages have been preserved, such as the Otgol village (Gyeongju Choi clan's original residence area) and the Inheung village (Nampyeong Mun's). In the urban area, the Joseon Dynasty's administrative or educational buildings including Gyeongsang-gamyeong (\uacbd\uc0c1\uac10\uc601, \u6176\u5c19\u76e3\u71df) and Daegu-hyanggyo (\ub300\uad6c\ud5a5\uad50, \u5927\u90b1\u9115\u6821) also remain. The main gateway of the city in that period called Yeongnam-jeilmun (\uc601\ub0a8\uc81c\uc77c\ubb38, \u5dba\u5357\u7b2c\u4e00\u9580, meaning the first gateway in Yeongnam), has been restored in Mangudang Park. Western style modern architecture like Gyesan Cathedral and the old building of Jeil Church are preserved across the urban area. Gyesan Cathedral is the third oldest gothic church building in Korea and the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Daegu which is one of three archdioceses in South Korea. Several buildings, in the present Keisung Academy and the KNU middle/high school, are famous too.\nYangnyeongsi (\uc57d\ub839\uc2dc, \u85e5\u4ee4\u5e02) in Namseongno (often called Yakjeon-golmok) is the oldest market for Korean medicinal herbs in the country with a history of 350 years. Bongsan-dong which has some art galleries and studios is being developed as the artistic center of the city since the 1990s.\nNearby tourist attractions include Haeinsa\u2014a Buddhist temple that houses the Tripitaka Koreana (a woodblock edition of the Tripitaka and one of the world's oldest extant complete collections of the Buddhist scriptures). Haeinsa is located in Gayasan National Park of Hapcheon, Gyeongnam. The historic city of Gyeongju, Gyeongbuk, the capital of the ancient kingdom of Silla is located east of Daegu.\n\n\n=== Mountains and parks ===\n\nMt. Palgong, Mt. Biseul, and Mt. Ap are the representative mountains in Daegu. Apsan, just in the southern part of the city, is the closest mountain from the urban area among them. It has many trails, Buddhist temples, a Korean War museum, and a gondola ride to the peak. Additionally, Waryongsan, Hamjisan, and Yongjibong are located in the city. These serve as neighborhood parks to the citizens. Mt. Palgong has a cable car to the summit. There are also hiking trails in the direction of the Donghwasa Temple and Sutaegol Valley.\nIn the urban area, several small mountains and hills play the same role. Dalseong Park, which sits inside a 1,500-year-old earth fortress, is a historic place of the city. It contains the city's only zoo and some monuments as well as the wall. Duryu Park or Duryusan is a large forest in the middle of the urban area. It has Daegu Tower, Woobang Land, Kolon Bandstand, Duryu Stadium, and many sports facilities. Daegu Tower, also called Woobang Tower or Duryu Tower, is the tallest contemporary structure (202 m) and a symbol of the city. Its observatory commands good views of the surroundings. Woobang Land is the largest amusement park out of the capital area. Many small gardens lie in the heart of the city, such as the National Debt Repayment Movement Memorial Park (Gukchae Bosang Park) and 2\u00b728 Park. The former park includes Dalgubeol-daejong (\ub2ec\uad6c\ubc8c\ub300\uc885, \u9054\u53e5\u4f10\u5927\u9418), which means the Dalgubeol grand bell. The bell is struck every week and year. There is also a botanical garden with a variety of plants and flowers.\n\n\n=== Downtown and shopping ===\nDongseongno (\ub3d9\uc131\ub85c, \u6771\u57ce\u8def) is the downtown of Daegu lying from the Daegu Station to Jung-ang pachulso (central police station) near the Banwoldang subway station in the center of the city Jung-gu. It has the Jung-angno subway station as the nearest station from its heart. Like its name meaning the street in the east fortress, the eastern part of Daegu-eupseong (\ub300\uad6c\uc74d\uc131, \u5927\u90b1\u9091\u57ce, means the Daegu-Principality Fortress) was situated along this street. The fortress, however, had been demolished in the early 20th century. Although Daegu is the nation's third or fourth largest city, the Dongseongno area form the largest and the broadest downtown area in the whole country except the capital city, Seoul.  In most cases, famous brands open their branch shop first here out of the Greater Seoul area.\n\nSub-downtowns in the city have its own commercial powers and colors. The area around the Seongseo Industrial Complex subway station in Dalseo-gu is a concentration of many amusement spots, and young people easily can be seen around Kyungpook National University in Buk-gu. Deuran-gil (means the street inside the field) in Suseong-gu is known for many restaurants.\nThe city has a number of department stores. Many of these belong to national or multinational chains, but the local Daegu Department Store also operates two branches, while another local chain, Donga Department Store operates four in the city proper. The six department stores among them gather at the downtown. The traditional markets such as Seomun Market and Chilseong Market sell all sorts of goods.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nMany traditional ceremonies and festivals in agrarian society disappeared in the process of modernization. A Confucian ritual ceremony called Seokjeondaeje is held at Daegu-hyanggyo every spring and autumn. The Yangnyeongsi herb medical festival and Otgol village festival are the contemporary festivals about traditional culture.\nLately in the city, enthusiasm about performing arts is growing and the local government is trying to meet its demand. Daegu International Opera Festival (DIOF) in October since 2003, Daegu International Musical Festival (DIMF), and Daegu International Bodypainting Festival (DIBF) are three of the most famous festivals on each field in Korea, although those have short histories.\nVarious festivals in various themes like the Colorful Daegu Festival, Dongseongno festival, Palgongsan maple festival, Biseulsan azalea festival, Korea in Motion Daegu, and so on, are held by the city, each ward, or the specific groups, all through the year.\nOn August 25 through August 31, 2008, Daegu hosted the first ever Asian Bodypainting Festival, a sister event of the World Bodypainting Festival in Seeboden, Austria.\nEach year the city is home to the Daegu International Jazz Festival: http://www.dijf.or.kr/\nEvery May the \"Colorful Daegu Festival\" offers performances and art programs including the Colorful Parade.

        "wiki": "Daegu (Korean: [t\u025b\u0261u]; \ub300\uad6c, \u5927\u90b1, literally 'large hill'\ub300\uad6c\uad11\uc5ed\uc2dc), formerly spelled Taegu and officially known as the Daegu Metropolitan City, is a city in South Korea, the fourth-largest after Seoul, Busan, and Incheon and the third-largest metropolitan area in the nation with over 2.5 million residents. Also, it is the second largest city in the Yeongnam region after Busan. However, it is the fourth city in terms of population after Seoul, Busan and Incheon. It was overtaken by Incheon in the 2000s, but still it is said to be the third city according to the \"Act on the Establishment of Daegu City and Incheon City\" (Act No. 3424 and April 13, 1981). Daegu and surrounding North Gyeongsang Province are often referred to as Daegu-Gyeongbuk, with a total population over 5 million. \nDaegu is located in south-eastern Korea about 80 km (50 mi) from the seacoast, near the Geumho River and its mainstream, Nakdong River in Gyeongsang-do. The Daegu basin is the central plain of the Yeongnam region. In ancient times, the Daegu area was part of the proto-kingdom Jinhan. Subsequently, Daegu came under the control of the Silla Kingdom, which unified the Korean Peninsula. During the Joseon Dynasty period, the city was the capital of Gyeongsang-do, one of the traditional eight provinces of the country.\nDaegu was an economic motor of Korea during the 1960s\u20131980s period and was especially known for its electronics industry. The humid subtropical climate of Daegu is ideal for producing high-quality apples, thus the nickname, \"Apple City\". Daegu is also known as \"Textile City\". Textiles used to be the pillar industry of the city. With the establishment of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone, Daegu is currently focusing on fostering fashion and high-tech industries.\nDaegu was the host city of the 22nd World Energy Congress, the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, and the 2003 Summer Universiade. It also hosted four matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory and early history ===\nArchaeological investigations in the Greater Daegu area have revealed a large number of settlements and burials of the prehistoric Mumun Pottery Period (around 1500\u2013300 BC). In fact, some of the earliest evidence of Mumun settlement in Gyeongsangdo have been excavated from Siji-dong and Seobyeon-dong. Dongcheon-dong is one of the substantial Mumun agricultural villages that have been excavated. The Dongcheon-dong site dates back to the Middle Mumun (around 850\u2013550 BC) and contains the remains of many prehistoric pit-houses and agricultural fields. Megalithic burials (dolmens) have also been found in large numbers in Daegu.\nAncient historical texts indicate that during the Proto\u2013Three Kingdoms (Mahan, Jinhan, and Byeonhan) period, Daegu was the site of a chiefdom or walled-town polity known from that time, according to historical records, as Dalgubeol. It was absorbed into the kingdom of Silla no later than the fifth century. The vestiges of the wall can be seen, and relics have been excavated in the current Dalseong Park.\n\n\n=== Silla ===\nSilla succeeded in unifying the Korean peninsula by defeating the other kingdoms of Baekje and Koguryo in the late seventh century, partly due to assistance from China's Tang Dynasty. Shortly thereafter, in 689, Silla's King Sinmun considered moving the capital from Gyeongju to Daegu, but was unable to do so.  This initiative is known only through a single line in the Samguk Sagi, a most valued historical record of ancient Korea by Koryeo Dynasty historian Kim Bu-sik, but it is presumed to indicate both an attempt by the Silla king to reinforce royal authority and the entrenched resistance of the Gyeongju political elites that was the likely cause of the move's failure. The city was given its current name in 757.\nIn the late 1990s, archaeologists excavated a large-scale fortified Silla site in Dongcheon-dong, Buk-gu. The site at Locality 2 consists of the remains of 39 raised-floor buildings enclosed by a formidable ditch-and-palisade system. The excavators hypothesize that the fortified site was a permanent military encampment or barracks. Archaeologists also uncovered a large Silla village dating to the sixth to seventh centuries AD at Siji-dong.\n\n\n=== Later Three Kingdoms and Goryeo ===\nDuring the Later Three Kingdoms period, 892\u2013936, Daegu was initially aligned with Hubaekje. In 927, northern Daegu was the site of the Battle of Gong Mountain between the forces of Goryeo under Wang Geon and those of Hubaekje under Gyeon Hwon. In this battle, the forces of Goryeo were crushed and Wang Geon himself was saved only by the heroic deed of his general Shin Sung-gyeom. However,  the atrocities of the Hubaekje forces at this time apparently changed local sympathizers to favor Wang Geon, who later became the king of Goryeo.\nNumerous place names and local legends in the area still bear witness to the historic battle of 927. Among these are \"Ansim\", which literally means \"peace of mind\", said to be the first place where Wang Geon dared to stop after escaping the battle, and \"Banwol\", or half-moon, where he is said to have stopped and admired the moon before returning to Goryeo. A statue commemorating the battle now stands in northern Daegu, as does a memorial to Sin Sunggyeom.\nIn the Goryeo period, the first edition of the Tripitaka Koreana was stored in Daegu, at the temple of Buinsa.  However, this edition was destroyed when the temple was sacked in 1254, during the Mongol invasions of Korea.\n\n\n=== Joseon ===\n\nDaegu served as an important transportation center during the Joseon Dynasty. She stands in the mid part of the Great Yeongnam Road which ran between Seoul and Busan. It lay at the junction of this arterial road and the roads to Gyeongju and Jinju.\nIn 1601, Daegu became the administrative capital of the Gyeongsang-do, which is current Daegu, Busan, Ulsan, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and Gyeongsangnam-do. At about that time, the city began to grow into a major city. The status continued for nearly 300 years, and the city has been transformed as the capital of Gyeongsangbuk-do since Gyeongsang-do was divided into two provinces, Gyeongsangbuk-do (northern Gyeongsang-province) and Gyeongsangnam-do (southern one) in 1896.\nDaegu's first regular markets were established during the late Joseon period. The most famous of these is the Yangnyeongsi herbal medicine market. This became a center of herbal trade in Joseon, and even attracted buyers from neighboring countries. Traders from Japan, who were not permitted to leave the Nakdong River valley, hired messengers to visit the market on their behalf. Seomun Market, which stood at the city's west gate at that time, was one of the top-three markets in the Joseon period.\n\n\n=== Korean Empire and colonial rule ===\nThe Korean hermit kingdom finally opened itself to the outside world in the late 19th century. In 1895, Daegu became the site of one of the country's first modern post offices, as a part of the 'Gab-o' reforms introduced in the aftermath of the Sino-Japanese war.Beginning in the late 1890s, increasing numbers of foreign merchants and workers started to visit Daegu, which emerged as a modern transportation center of the newly constructed Gyeongbu Line main railroad connecting Seoul and Busan.\nIn 1905, the old fortress wall was forcibly destroyed. The wall still survives only in the street names such as the streets Dongseongno and Bukseongno, \"east fortress street\" and \"north fortress street\", which now run where the wall once stood.\nIndependence movements against imperial aggressions were outstanding in Daegu. These began as early as 1898, when a branch of the Independence Club was opened in the town.  As the demise of the Korean Empire approached in 1907, local citizens led by Seo Sang-don organized the National Debt Repayment Movement. The movement spread nationwide, although it fell short of repaying the national debt through individual donations. Freedom fighting continued after the 1910 annexation, notably during the March 1st movement of 1919. At that time, four major demonstrations took place in Daegu, involving an estimated 23,000 peace-loving citizens.\n\n\n=== After 1945 ===\nIn 1946, the Daegu October Incident took place, one of the most serious social disorders since the foundation of the Republic of Korea. An operation by the Korean national police to take control of rioters on October 1 resulted in the death of three student demonstrators and injuries to many others, sparking a massive counter-attack, killing as many as 38 policemen. It was also the site of major demonstrations on February 28, 1960, prior to the presidential election of that year.Daegu and all of North Gyeongsang province had heavy guerrilla activities in the late 1940s, as thousands of refugees shied away from the fighting in Jeolla province and sought shelters in Daegu.  In November 1948, a unit in Daegu joined the mutiny which had begun in Yeosu the previous month.During the Korean War, heavy fighting occurred nearby along the Nakdong River. Daegu sat inside the Pusan Perimeter, however, so remained in South Korean hands throughout the war. As in many other areas during the Korean War, political killings of dissenters were widespread. A large series of engagements was fought around the city to prevent North Korean troops from crossing the Nakdong, the Battle of Taegu.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the city underwent explosive growth, and the population has increased more than tenfold since the end of the Korean War. The city was politically favored during the 18-year-long rule of Park Chung-hee, when it and the surrounding area served as his political base. Daegu champions conservative political ideas and movements today and is a political base for the Saenuri Party.\nIn the 1980s, Daegu separated from Gyeongsangbuk-do and became a separately administered provincial-level directly governed city (Jikhalsi), and was redesignated as a metropolitan city (Gwangyeoksi) in 1995. Today, Daegu is the third-largest metropolitan area in Korea with respect to both population and commerce.\nIn February 2020, Daegu became known for the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nTwo local governments are in the city, the Daegu Metropolitan Government in Jung District and Gyeongbuk Provincial Government in Buk District. The provincial government will be relocated to Andong in its proper province, Gyeongbuk. The mayor and heads of city's eight districts are directly elected by the citizens every four years. The city council has 29 members which consist of 26 from the same number of electoral districts and three proportional representations. They are also directly elected every four years. Most of them are the members of the Liberty Korea Party, the main conservative political party in South Korea. Daegu is a stronghold for the party and has produced two Presidents of the Republic of Korea thus far: Roh Tae-woo and Park Geun-hye. As the capital of the Korean conservatives, the city has wielded strong political influence in elections.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nDaegu is divided into 7 districts (Gu) and 1 county (Gun)\n\nJung District (\uc911\uad6c, \u4e2d\u5340) \u2013 means the central district.\nDong District (\ub3d9\uad6c, \u6771\u5340) \u2013 means the east district.\nSeo District (\uc11c\uad6c, \u897f\u5340) \u2013 means the west district.\nNam District (\ub0a8\uad6c, \u5357\u5340) \u2013 means the south district.\nBuk District (\ubd81\uad6c, \u5317\u5340) \u2013 means the north district.\nSuseong District (\uc218\uc131\uad6c, \u58fd\u57ce\u5340)\nDalseo District (\ub2ec\uc11c\uad6c, \u9054\u897f\u5340)\nDalseong County (\ub2ec\uc131\uad70, \u9054\u57ce\u90e1)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nDaegu sits in a basin surrounded by low mountains. Palgongsan to the north, Biseulsan to the south, Waryongsan to the west, and a series of smaller hills in the east. The Geumho River flows along the northern and eastern edges of the city, emptying in the Nakdong River west of the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDaegu has a cooler version of a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa). In Holdridge climate classification, Daegu has a warm temperate moist forest climate. The mountains that comprise the basin trap hot and humid air. Similarly, in winter, cold air lies in the basin. The area receives little precipitation except during the rainy season of summer, and is sunny throughout much of the year. Data gathered since 1961 indicates that the mean temperature for January, the coldest month in Daegu, is 0.6 \u00b0C (33 \u00b0F) and that for August, the warmest month, is 26.4 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F). The City's lowest record temperature was \u221220.2 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F), and the City's highest record temperature was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F). The 40 degrees Celsius recorded in 1942 is also the highest temperature record in South Korea since the observation. This summer temperature has led to the emergence of a new term called Dae-Prika (Daegu+Africa) starting with the Internet community, and has recently been used in the media, broadcasting, etc. \n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nDaegu is a manufacturing industry city. The major industries are textiles, metals and machinery. In the year 2010, Daegu had a regional GDP of $45,387 million with 7.2% real GDP growth rate. The GDP per capita though is well below Korea national average. Many companies such as Daegu Bank, Korea Delphi, Hwasung corp., and TaeguTec are situated in this city, and Samsung and Kolon were founded here. Numerous factories are located in the industrial complexes situated in the west and north sides of the city including the Seongseo Industrial Complex, West Daegu Industrial Complex and the Daegu Dyeing Industrial Complex.\nThe city is the economic and industrial core of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk region, one of the major industrial areas in Korea. It accounted for as much as 94 percent of Korea's trade surplus in 2006. The electronics industries in Gumi and the steel industries in Pohang provided great services to that surplus. World-leading manufacturing facilities for Anycall (Samsung Mobile) and POSCO's main factories are located near the city. Daegu and its neighbouring cities were designated for the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone by the central government in 2008. It is specialized companies like Winitech software company in knowledge-based service and manufacturing industries.\nHistorically, Daegu has been the commercial center of the southern part of the Korean Peninsula with Seoul in the center and Pyongyang in the north (currently North Korea), because of its advantageous location. Some of the large, traditional markets like Seomun Market are still flourishing in the city.\nAdditionally, Daegu was considered the third major economic city in Korea, after Seoul and Busan. However, due to the decline of the textile industry, which is the heart of Daegu's economy, the overall economic growth of the city has also fallen.\nAlso, the city is the warmest region in South Korea due to the humid subtropical climate. This climate condition provides the region with high quality apples and oriental melons. The fruit industry is a crucial support for the local economy. Due to the stagnant economy, Daegu's population began to decrease after 2003. Recently, the local government has begun focusing on working towards economic revival and concentrating on improving the city's fashion industry.\n\n\n=== Fashion industry ===\nBeginning in the late 1990s, Daegu has been actively making efforts to promote its fashion industry based on its textile and clothing manufacturing industries under the 'Daegu: Fashion City'. The city opens many exhibitions related to the fashion and textile industries including the Daegu Fashion Fair and Preview in Daegu annually or semi-annually, and invites national institutes. A large new town specializing in the textile-fashion industries is currently under construction in Bongmu-dong, northeastern Daegu. The district, officially named Esiapolis, takes aim at the fashion hub of East Asia. Textile complexes, textile-fashion institutions, an international school, fashion malls as well as residential areas plan to be developed in the district.\n\n\n== Culture and sightseeing ==\n\nGenerally Daegu is known as a conservative city. As well as being the largest inland city in the country beside Seoul it has become one of the major metropolitan areas in the nation. Traditionally, Buddhism has been strong; today there are still many temples. Confucianism is also popular in Daegu, with a large academy based in the city. Neon cross-topped spires of Christian churches can also be seen in the city.\n\n\n=== Sights ===\nThe most well-known sight of the city is the stone Buddha called Gatbawi on the top of Gwanbong, Palgongsan. It is famous for its stone gat (Korean traditional hat). People from all over the country visit the place, because they believe that the Buddha will grant one's single desire. Administratively, the site itself is located in the neighboring city, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk.\n\nOn the outskirts of the city, mountains keep many traditional temples such as Donghwasa, Pagyesa, and Buinsa. Donghwasa is a Buddhist temple that was built by Priest Geukdal-hwasang in 493, and many artifacts of the period are found around the temple. The International Tourist Zen Meditation Center is Korea's only Zen-themed center. Some lecture halls or memorial halls such as Dodong-seowon (\ub3c4\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9053\u6771\u66f8\u9662) and Nokdong-seowon (\ub179\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9e7f\u6d1e\u66f8\u9662) are also located in the suburbs.\nOld villages have been preserved, such as the Otgol village (Gyeongju Choi clan's original residence area) and the Inheung village (Nampyeong Mun's). In the urban area, the Joseon Dynasty's administrative or educational buildings including Gyeongsang-gamyeong (\uacbd\uc0c1\uac10\uc601, \u6176\u5c19\u76e3\u71df) and Daegu-hyanggyo (\ub300\uad6c\ud5a5\uad50, \u5927\u90b1\u9115\u6821) also remain. The main gateway of the city in that period called Yeongnam-jeilmun (\uc601\ub0a8\uc81c\uc77c\ubb38, \u5dba\u5357\u7b2c\u4e00\u9580, meaning the first gateway in Yeongnam), has been restored in Mangudang Park. Western style modern architecture like Gyesan Cathedral and the old building of Jeil Church are preserved across the urban area. Gyesan Cathedral is the third oldest gothic church building in Korea and the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Daegu which is one of three archdioceses in South Korea. Several buildings, in the present Keisung Academy and the KNU middle/high school, are famous too.\nYangnyeongsi (\uc57d\ub839\uc2dc, \u85e5\u4ee4\u5e02) in Namseongno (often called Yakjeon-golmok) is the oldest market for Korean medicinal herbs in the country with a history of 350 years. Bongsan-dong which has some art galleries and studios is being developed as the artistic center of the city since the 1990s.\nNearby tourist attractions include Haeinsa\u2014a Buddhist temple that houses the Tripitaka Koreana (a woodblock edition of the Tripitaka and one of the world's oldest extant complete collections of the Buddhist scriptures). Haeinsa is located in Gayasan National Park of Hapcheon, Gyeongnam. The historic city of Gyeongju, Gyeongbuk, the capital of the ancient kingdom of Silla is located east of Daegu.\n\n\n=== Mountains and parks ===\n\nMt. Palgong, Mt. Biseul, and Mt. Ap are the representative mountains in Daegu. Apsan, just in the southern part of the city, is the closest mountain from the urban area among them. It has many trails, Buddhist temples, a Korean War museum, and a gondola ride to the peak. Additionally, Waryongsan, Hamjisan, and Yongjibong are located in the city. These serve as neighborhood parks to the citizens. Mt. Palgong has a cable car to the summit. There are also hiking trails in the direction of the Donghwasa Temple and Sutaegol Valley.\nIn the urban area, several small mountains and hills play the same role. Dalseong Park, which sits inside a 1,500-year-old earth fortress, is a historic place of the city. It contains the city's only zoo and some monuments as well as the wall. Duryu Park or Duryusan is a large forest in the middle of the urban area. It has Daegu Tower, Woobang Land, Kolon Bandstand, Duryu Stadium, and many sports facilities. Daegu Tower, also called Woobang Tower or Duryu Tower, is the tallest contemporary structure (202 m) and a symbol of the city. Its observatory commands good views of the surroundings. Woobang Land is the largest amusement park out of the capital area. Many small gardens lie in the heart of the city, such as the National Debt Repayment Movement Memorial Park (Gukchae Bosang Park) and 2\u00b728 Park. The former park includes Dalgubeol-daejong (\ub2ec\uad6c\ubc8c\ub300\uc885, \u9054\u53e5\u4f10\u5927\u9418), which means the Dalgubeol grand bell. The bell is struck every week and year. There is also a botanical garden with a variety of plants and flowers.\n\n\n=== Downtown and shopping ===\nDongseongno (\ub3d9\uc131\ub85c, \u6771\u57ce\u8def) is the downtown of Daegu lying from the Daegu Station to Jung-ang pachulso (central police station) near the Banwoldang subway station in the center of the city Jung-gu. It has the Jung-angno subway station as the nearest station from its heart. Like its name meaning the street in the east fortress, the eastern part of Daegu-eupseong (\ub300\uad6c\uc74d\uc131, \u5927\u90b1\u9091\u57ce, means the Daegu-Principality Fortress) was situated along this street. The fortress, however, had been demolished in the early 20th century. Although Daegu is the nation's third or fourth largest city, the Dongseongno area form the largest and the broadest downtown area in the whole country except the capital city, Seoul.  In most cases, famous brands open their branch shop first here out of the Greater Seoul area.\n\nSub-downtowns in the city have its own commercial powers and colors. The area around the Seongseo Industrial Complex subway station in Dalseo-gu is a concentration of many amusement spots, and young people easily can be seen around Kyungpook National University in Buk-gu. Deuran-gil (means the street inside the field) in Suseong-gu is known for many restaurants.\nThe city has a number of department stores. Many of these belong to national or multinational chains, but the local Daegu Department Store also operates two branches, while another local chain, Donga Department Store operates four in the city proper. The six department stores among them gather at the downtown. The traditional markets such as Seomun Market and Chilseong Market sell all sorts of goods.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nMany traditional ceremonies and festivals in agrarian society disappeared in the process of modernization. A Confucian ritual ceremony called Seokjeondaeje is held at Daegu-hyanggyo every spring and autumn. The Yangnyeongsi herb medical festival and Otgol village festival are the contemporary festivals about traditional culture.\nLately in the city, enthusiasm about performing arts is growing and the local government is trying to meet its demand. Daegu International Opera Festival (DIOF) in October since 2003, Daegu International Musical Festival (DIMF), and Daegu International Bodypainting Festival (DIBF) are three of the most famous festivals on each field in Korea, although those have short histories.\nVarious festivals in various themes like the Colorful Daegu Festival, Dongseongno festival, Palgongsan maple festival, Biseulsan azalea festival, Korea in Motion Daegu, and so on, are held by the city, each ward, or the specific groups, all through the year.\nOn August 25 through August 31, 2008, Daegu hosted the first ever Asian Bodypainting Festival, a sister event of the World Bodypainting Festival in Seeboden, Austria.\nEach year the city is home to the Daegu International Jazz Festival: http://www.dijf.or.kr/\nEvery May the \"Colorful Daegu Festival\" offers performances and art programs including the Colorful Parade. In July, the Daegu Chimac Festival takes place at Duryu Park in Dalseo-gu, Daegu. The term \"chimac\" is a portmanteau of chicken and maekju (meaning \"beer\"). There were over 880,000 visitors in 2015, and one million visitors during the festival in 2016.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nDaegu Art Museum\nDaegu National Museum \u2013 A notable national museum collecting relics excavated in and around Daegu\nDaegu Bangjja Yugi (Korean Bronzeware) Museum\nHengso Museum of Keimyung University\nKorea Video Museum\nKyungpook National University Museum\nMuseum for Daegu National University of Education\nMuseum of Natural Dye Arts\n\n\n=== Theaters ===\nDaegu Opera House \u2013 The first theater in Korea only for performing opera\nSuseong Artpia\nKeimyung Art Center \u2013 One of the largest scale theaters in the city.\nDaegu Culture and Arts Center\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nOn March 27, 2007, the city was selected to host the 2011 World Championships in Athletics. Daegu competed with cities such as Moscow, Russia and Brisbane, Australia to earn the votes of the IAAF Council. The event was the fourth IAAF World Championships in Athletics to be held outside Europe, and the first games in mainland Asia. It was also the third worldwide sports event held in Korea after the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul and 2002 FIFA World Cup in Korea and Japan. Daegu also hosted three matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, and the 2003 Summer Universiade. The city hosts the Colorful Daegu Pre-Championships Meeting every year since 2005.\n\nDaegu Stadium is the second largest sports complex in South Korea with a seating capacity of 66,422. Daegu Civic Stadium hosted some football matches at the 1988 Summer Olympics.\nThe Daegu Marathon is held here every year in April. The race begins and ends at the Daegu Stadium.\n\n\n==== Sports teams ====\n\n\n===== The Samsung Lions =====\nThe Samsung Lions (Hangul: \uc0bc\uc131 \ub77c\uc774\uc628\uc988) are a South Korean professional baseball team founded in 1982. They are based in the southeastern city of Daegu and are members of the KBO League. Their home stadium is Daegu Samsung Lions Park. They have won the Korean Series eight times. The Samsung Lions is the first team to win four consecutive Korean Series titles (2011, 2012, 2013, 2014). The Samsung Lions are also the first Korean team ever to win a regular league title for five consecutive years (2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015).\n\n\n===== Daegu FC =====\nDaegu Football Club, commonly referred to as Daegu FC (Korean: \ub300\uad6c FC), is a South Korean professional football club based in Daegu. The club was founded as a community club at the end of 2002, and the club made their K League 1 debut in 2003. Historically, Daegu have always placed in the lower reaches of the K League 1. Their best seasons to date have been 2019, when they finished in 5th place (Ranked 5th out of 12 teams), and participated in AFC Champions League. They were also the winners of the Korean FA Cup in 2018, having previously been semi-finalists in 2008.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nThere are three terrestrial TV broadcasting stations in the city: KBS Daegu Broadcast Station, Daegu MBC, and TBC. These are affiliated companies of central broadcasting stations in Seoul just like other local broadcasting companies in South Korea. TBC (Taegu Broadcasting Corporation) depends on SBS. They cover to Gyeongsangbuk-do out of the city.

        "wiki": "The Daegu subway fire occurred on February 18, 2003, when an arsonist set fire to a train which killed 192 people and injured 151 others at the Jungangno Station of the Daegu Metropolitan Subway in Daegu, South Korea. The fire had spread across two trains within minutes. It remains the deadliest deliberate loss of life in a single incident in South Korean peacetime history, succeeding the previous record set by a 1982 mass shooting.\n\n\n== Arsonist ==\nThe arsonist, Kim Dae-han (Hangeul: \uae40\ub300\ud55c, Hanja: \u91d1\u5927\u6f22), was a 56-year-old unemployed former taxi driver who had suffered a stroke in November 2001 that left him partly paralyzed. Kim was dissatisfied with his medical treatment and had expressed sentiments of violence and depression; he later told police he wanted to kill himself, but to do so in a crowded place rather than alone. By most accounts, on the morning of February 18, he boarded train 1079 on Line 1 in the direction of Daegok Station, carrying a duffel bag that contained two green milk cartons filled with a flammable liquid, possibly paint thinner or gasoline.\n\n\n== Arson ==\nAs the train left Banwoldang Station around 9:53 a.m., Kim began fumbling with the cartons and a cigarette lighter, alarming other passengers who tried to stop him. In the struggle, one of the cartons spilled and its liquid contents caught fire as the train pulled into Jungangno Station in downtown Daegu. Kim, his back and legs on fire, managed to escape along with many passengers on train 1079, but within two minutes the fire had spread to all six cars. The fire spread quickly in the insulation between the layers of aluminum that form the shell of the cars, the vinyl and plastic materials in seat cushions and strap handles, and heavy plastic matting on the floors, producing thick smoke as it burned.\n\n\n=== Errors compounding the disaster ===\n\nThe operator of the train, Choi Jeong-hwan (Hangeul: \ucd5c\uc815\ud658)(aged 31), failed to notify subway officials immediately of the fire.\nSmoke being visible on their closed-circuit television monitors, subway officials radioed the operator of train 1080, Choi Sang-yeol (Hangeul: \ucd5c\uc131\uc5f4), advising him to proceed with caution because there was a fire in the station. Train 1080 entered Jungangno station and stopped alongside blazing train 1079 approximately four minutes later. The doors opened only briefly, then shut, apparently in an effort to keep out the toxic smoke that had filled the station. Shortly after train 1080's arrival, an automatic fire detector shut down the power supply to both trains, preventing train 1080 from leaving the station.\nTranscripts show Choi Sang-yeol made three announcements advising passengers in train 1080 to remain seated while he attempted to reach superiors. Finally, he was advised \"Quickly, run somewhere else. Go up... kill the engine and go.\" Choi then opened the doors and fled, but in doing so he removed the master key, which led to a shutdown of the onboard batteries that powered the train doors and effectively sealed passengers inside. Later investigation showed that 79 passengers remained trapped inside train 1080 and died there.\nInadequate emergency equipment also worsened the disaster. Daegu subway trains were not equipped with fire extinguishers, and the stations lacked sprinklers and emergency lighting. Many victims became disoriented in the dark, smoke-filled underground station and died of asphyxiation looking for exits. Emergency ventilation systems also proved inadequate. Over 1,300 fire and emergency personnel responded and the fire itself was extinguished around 1:38 p.m.; however, the toxicity of the smoke prevented them from entering the station for another three and a half hours.\n\n\n== Victims ==\nThe intensity of the fire made it difficult to accurately assess the number of victims. Most were burned beyond recognition, many to the bone, and required DNA analysis to identify. A total of 192 people are confirmed to have perished. Of the bodies found, 185 were identifiable; six could not initially be identified, of which three were discovered using DNA; and one person's possessions were identified but their remains could not be located.\nAs the incident occurred late in the morning rush hour, most of the victims were students or young women who worked in the downtown district's department stores, which opened at 10:30 a.m. Many were able to contact loved ones on their mobile phones, and mobile phone operators released call connection and attempt records to help authorities determine who was in the station.\n\n\n== Investigation and cover-up ==\nChoi Sang-yeol could not be located for 10 hours after the accident, and investigators later discovered he had made contact with officials from the subway corporation during that time. The master key from train 1080 was found in an office at the Ansim train depot. Omissions from transcripts of radio communications also heightened suspicion of an attempted cover-up.\nOn February 26, 2003, authorities arrested Kim Dae-han, who had fled to a hospital for treatment. They also arrested both Choi and six officials of the Daegu Metropolitan Subway Corporation, the head of which was fired the same day.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nThe incident prompted outpourings of sympathy and anger from throughout South Korea and internationally.\nOfficials promised to install better safety equipment in subway stations, and added spray-on fire resistant chemicals to the interiors of the cars of the Daegu Metropolitan Subway. Six stations were taken out of service for refurbishment and restored in April 2003. The tragedy was considered by many a national embarrassment, provoking debate about whether South Korea had cut too many corners in safety during its rapid industrialization. Several metro trains throughout the country were subsequently refurbished to improve fire-resistant standards within a few years of the accident.\nOn August 7, the Daegu District Court convicted Choi Sang-yeol, operator of train 1080, and Choi Jeong-hwan, operator of train 1079, sentencing them to prison for five and four years respectively for criminal negligence. Kim Dae-han was convicted of arson and homicide. Although prosecutors had pushed for the death penalty, which was also supported by victims' families, the court instead sentenced him to life imprisonment on account of his remorse and mental instability. Kim died of a chronic illness in prison on August 31, 2004, in the city of Jinju, where he had been receiving medical treatment.In December 2008, the Daegu Safety Theme Park opened. The goal is to educate the inhabitants of Daegu about safety.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n1995 Baku Metro fire\nChengdu bus fire\nKing's Cross Fire\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\niCivilEngineer Engineering Failure Watch: South Korean Subway Fire\nSoo-Jeong. \"Subway horror: Errors revealed,\" Associated Press.\nHwang Sun-yoon. \"200 dead, missing in Daegu arson,\" Joong-Ang Ilbo, February 19, 2003\nByun Duk-kun. \"Slow Response Causes More Death,\" Hankook Ilbo February 18, 2003\nDozens Dead, Hundreds Injured, Missing in South Korea Subway Fire, CNN Transcript, February 18, 2003\nAnger mounts over Korean fire, BBC News, February 20, 2003\nKirk, Don. \"Effort to Fix Responsibility for Deadly Korean Subway Fire,\" The New York Times, February 21, 2003\n\"Fire Alarm Ignored and Not Immediately Informed,\" Dong-A Ilbo, February 23, 2003\nChristensen, Geir.

        "wiki": "Daegu (Korean: [t\u025b\u0261u]; \ub300\uad6c, \u5927\u90b1, literally 'large hill'\ub300\uad6c\uad11\uc5ed\uc2dc), formerly spelled Taegu and officially known as the Daegu Metropolitan City, is a city in South Korea, the fourth-largest after Seoul, Busan, and Incheon and the third-largest metropolitan area in the nation with over 2.5 million residents. Also, it is the second largest city in the Yeongnam region after Busan. However, it is the fourth city in terms of population after Seoul, Busan and Incheon. It was overtaken by Incheon in the 2000s, but still it is said to be the third city according to the \"Act on the Establishment of Daegu City and Incheon City\" (Act No. 3424 and April 13, 1981). Daegu and surrounding North Gyeongsang Province are often referred to as Daegu-Gyeongbuk, with a total population over 5 million. \nDaegu is located in south-eastern Korea about 80 km (50 mi) from the seacoast, near the Geumho River and its mainstream, Nakdong River in Gyeongsang-do. The Daegu basin is the central plain of the Yeongnam region. In ancient times, the Daegu area was part of the proto-kingdom Jinhan. Subsequently, Daegu came under the control of the Silla Kingdom, which unified the Korean Peninsula. During the Joseon Dynasty period, the city was the capital of Gyeongsang-do, one of the traditional eight provinces of the country.\nDaegu was an economic motor of Korea during the 1960s\u20131980s period and was especially known for its electronics industry. The humid subtropical climate of Daegu is ideal for producing high-quality apples, thus the nickname, \"Apple City\". Daegu is also known as \"Textile City\". Textiles used to be the pillar industry of the city. With the establishment of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone, Daegu is currently focusing on fostering fashion and high-tech industries.\nDaegu was the host city of the 22nd World Energy Congress, the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, and the 2003 Summer Universiade. It also hosted four matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory and early history ===\nArchaeological investigations in the Greater Daegu area have revealed a large number of settlements and burials of the prehistoric Mumun Pottery Period (around 1500\u2013300 BC). In fact, some of the earliest evidence of Mumun settlement in Gyeongsangdo have been excavated from Siji-dong and Seobyeon-dong. Dongcheon-dong is one of the substantial Mumun agricultural villages that have been excavated. The Dongcheon-dong site dates back to the Middle Mumun (around 850\u2013550 BC) and contains the remains of many prehistoric pit-houses and agricultural fields. Megalithic burials (dolmens) have also been found in large numbers in Daegu.\nAncient historical texts indicate that during the Proto\u2013Three Kingdoms (Mahan, Jinhan, and Byeonhan) period, Daegu was the site of a chiefdom or walled-town polity known from that time, according to historical records, as Dalgubeol. It was absorbed into the kingdom of Silla no later than the fifth century. The vestiges of the wall can be seen, and relics have been excavated in the current Dalseong Park.\n\n\n=== Silla ===\nSilla succeeded in unifying the Korean peninsula by defeating the other kingdoms of Baekje and Koguryo in the late seventh century, partly due to assistance from China's Tang Dynasty. Shortly thereafter, in 689, Silla's King Sinmun considered moving the capital from Gyeongju to Daegu, but was unable to do so.  This initiative is known only through a single line in the Samguk Sagi, a most valued historical record of ancient Korea by Koryeo Dynasty historian Kim Bu-sik, but it is presumed to indicate both an attempt by the Silla king to reinforce royal authority and the entrenched resistance of the Gyeongju political elites that was the likely cause of the move's failure. The city was given its current name in 757.\nIn the late 1990s, archaeologists excavated a large-scale fortified Silla site in Dongcheon-dong, Buk-gu. The site at Locality 2 consists of the remains of 39 raised-floor buildings enclosed by a formidable ditch-and-palisade system. The excavators hypothesize that the fortified site was a permanent military encampment or barracks. Archaeologists also uncovered a large Silla village dating to the sixth to seventh centuries AD at Siji-dong.\n\n\n=== Later Three Kingdoms and Goryeo ===\nDuring the Later Three Kingdoms period, 892\u2013936, Daegu was initially aligned with Hubaekje. In 927, northern Daegu was the site of the Battle of Gong Mountain between the forces of Goryeo under Wang Geon and those of Hubaekje under Gyeon Hwon. In this battle, the forces of Goryeo were crushed and Wang Geon himself was saved only by the heroic deed of his general Shin Sung-gyeom. However,  the atrocities of the Hubaekje forces at this time apparently changed local sympathizers to favor Wang Geon, who later became the king of Goryeo.\nNumerous place names and local legends in the area still bear witness to the historic battle of 927. Among these are \"Ansim\", which literally means \"peace of mind\", said to be the first place where Wang Geon dared to stop after escaping the battle, and \"Banwol\", or half-moon, where he is said to have stopped and admired the moon before returning to Goryeo. A statue commemorating the battle now stands in northern Daegu, as does a memorial to Sin Sunggyeom.\nIn the Goryeo period, the first edition of the Tripitaka Koreana was stored in Daegu, at the temple of Buinsa.  However, this edition was destroyed when the temple was sacked in 1254, during the Mongol invasions of Korea.\n\n\n=== Joseon ===\n\nDaegu served as an important transportation center during the Joseon Dynasty. She stands in the mid part of the Great Yeongnam Road which ran between Seoul and Busan. It lay at the junction of this arterial road and the roads to Gyeongju and Jinju.\nIn 1601, Daegu became the administrative capital of the Gyeongsang-do, which is current Daegu, Busan, Ulsan, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and Gyeongsangnam-do. At about that time, the city began to grow into a major city. The status continued for nearly 300 years, and the city has been transformed as the capital of Gyeongsangbuk-do since Gyeongsang-do was divided into two provinces, Gyeongsangbuk-do (northern Gyeongsang-province) and Gyeongsangnam-do (southern one) in 1896.\nDaegu's first regular markets were established during the late Joseon period. The most famous of these is the Yangnyeongsi herbal medicine market. This became a center of herbal trade in Joseon, and even attracted buyers from neighboring countries. Traders from Japan, who were not permitted to leave the Nakdong River valley, hired messengers to visit the market on their behalf. Seomun Market, which stood at the city's west gate at that time, was one of the top-three markets in the Joseon period.\n\n\n=== Korean Empire and colonial rule ===\nThe Korean hermit kingdom finally opened itself to the outside world in the late 19th century. In 1895, Daegu became the site of one of the country's first modern post offices, as a part of the 'Gab-o' reforms introduced in the aftermath of the Sino-Japanese war.Beginning in the late 1890s, increasing numbers of foreign merchants and workers started to visit Daegu, which emerged as a modern transportation center of the newly constructed Gyeongbu Line main railroad connecting Seoul and Busan.\nIn 1905, the old fortress wall was forcibly destroyed. The wall still survives only in the street names such as the streets Dongseongno and Bukseongno, \"east fortress street\" and \"north fortress street\", which now run where the wall once stood.\nIndependence movements against imperial aggressions were outstanding in Daegu. These began as early as 1898, when a branch of the Independence Club was opened in the town.  As the demise of the Korean Empire approached in 1907, local citizens led by Seo Sang-don organized the National Debt Repayment Movement. The movement spread nationwide, although it fell short of repaying the national debt through individual donations. Freedom fighting continued after the 1910 annexation, notably during the March 1st movement of 1919. At that time, four major demonstrations took place in Daegu, involving an estimated 23,000 peace-loving citizens.\n\n\n=== After 1945 ===\nIn 1946, the Daegu October Incident took place, one of the most serious social disorders since the foundation of the Republic of Korea. An operation by the Korean national police to take control of rioters on October 1 resulted in the death of three student demonstrators and injuries to many others, sparking a massive counter-attack, killing as many as 38 policemen. It was also the site of major demonstrations on February 28, 1960, prior to the presidential election of that year.Daegu and all of North Gyeongsang province had heavy guerrilla activities in the late 1940s, as thousands of refugees shied away from the fighting in Jeolla province and sought shelters in Daegu.  In November 1948, a unit in Daegu joined the mutiny which had begun in Yeosu the previous month.During the Korean War, heavy fighting occurred nearby along the Nakdong River. Daegu sat inside the Pusan Perimeter, however, so remained in South Korean hands throughout the war. As in many other areas during the Korean War, political killings of dissenters were widespread. A large series of engagements was fought around the city to prevent North Korean troops from crossing the Nakdong, the Battle of Taegu.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the city underwent explosive growth, and the population has increased more than tenfold since the end of the Korean War. The city was politically favored during the 18-year-long rule of Park Chung-hee, when it and the surrounding area served as his political base. Daegu champions conservative political ideas and movements today and is a political base for the Saenuri Party.\nIn the 1980s, Daegu separated from Gyeongsangbuk-do and became a separately administered provincial-level directly governed city (Jikhalsi), and was redesignated as a metropolitan city (Gwangyeoksi) in 1995. Today, Daegu is the third-largest metropolitan area in Korea with respect to both population and commerce.\nIn February 2020, Daegu became known for the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nTwo local governments are in the city, the Daegu Metropolitan Government in Jung District and Gyeongbuk Provincial Government in Buk District. The provincial government will be relocated to Andong in its proper province, Gyeongbuk. The mayor and heads of city's eight districts are directly elected by the citizens every four years. The city council has 29 members which consist of 26 from the same number of electoral districts and three proportional representations. They are also directly elected every four years. Most of them are the members of the Liberty Korea Party, the main conservative political party in South Korea. Daegu is a stronghold for the party and has produced two Presidents of the Republic of Korea thus far: Roh Tae-woo and Park Geun-hye. As the capital of the Korean conservatives, the city has wielded strong political influence in elections.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nDaegu is divided into 7 districts (Gu) and 1 county (Gun)\n\nJung District (\uc911\uad6c, \u4e2d\u5340) \u2013 means the central district.\nDong District (\ub3d9\uad6c, \u6771\u5340) \u2013 means the east district.\nSeo District (\uc11c\uad6c, \u897f\u5340) \u2013 means the west district.\nNam District (\ub0a8\uad6c, \u5357\u5340) \u2013 means the south district.\nBuk District (\ubd81\uad6c, \u5317\u5340) \u2013 means the north district.\nSuseong District (\uc218\uc131\uad6c, \u58fd\u57ce\u5340)\nDalseo District (\ub2ec\uc11c\uad6c, \u9054\u897f\u5340)\nDalseong County (\ub2ec\uc131\uad70, \u9054\u57ce\u90e1)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nDaegu sits in a basin surrounded by low mountains. Palgongsan to the north, Biseulsan to the south, Waryongsan to the west, and a series of smaller hills in the east. The Geumho River flows along the northern and eastern edges of the city, emptying in the Nakdong River west of the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDaegu has a cooler version of a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa). In Holdridge climate classification, Daegu has a warm temperate moist forest climate. The mountains that comprise the basin trap hot and humid air. Similarly, in winter, cold air lies in the basin. The area receives little precipitation except during the rainy season of summer, and is sunny throughout much of the year. Data gathered since 1961 indicates that the mean temperature for January, the coldest month in Daegu, is 0.6 \u00b0C (33 \u00b0F) and that for August, the warmest month, is 26.4 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F). The City's lowest record temperature was \u221220.2 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F), and the City's highest record temperature was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F). The 40 degrees Celsius recorded in 1942 is also the highest temperature record in South Korea since the observation. This summer temperature has led to the emergence of a new term called Dae-Prika (Daegu+Africa) starting with the Internet community, and has recently been used in the media, broadcasting, etc. \n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nDaegu is a manufacturing industry city. The major industries are textiles, metals and machinery. In the year 2010, Daegu had a regional GDP of $45,387 million with 7.2% real GDP growth rate. The GDP per capita though is well below Korea national average. Many companies such as Daegu Bank, Korea Delphi, Hwasung corp., and TaeguTec are situated in this city, and Samsung and Kolon were founded here. Numerous factories are located in the industrial complexes situated in the west and north sides of the city including the Seongseo Industrial Complex, West Daegu Industrial Complex and the Daegu Dyeing Industrial Complex.\nThe city is the economic and industrial core of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk region, one of the major industrial areas in Korea. It accounted for as much as 94 percent of Korea's trade surplus in 2006. The electronics industries in Gumi and the steel industries in Pohang provided great services to that surplus. World-leading manufacturing facilities for Anycall (Samsung Mobile) and POSCO's main factories are located near the city. Daegu and its neighbouring cities were designated for the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone by the central government in 2008. It is specialized companies like Winitech software company in knowledge-based service and manufacturing industries.\nHistorically, Daegu has been the commercial center of the southern part of the Korean Peninsula with Seoul in the center and Pyongyang in the north (currently North Korea), because of its advantageous location. Some of the large, traditional markets like Seomun Market are still flourishing in the city.\nAdditionally, Daegu was considered the third major economic city in Korea, after Seoul and Busan. However, due to the decline of the textile industry, which is the heart of Daegu's economy, the overall economic growth of the city has also fallen.\nAlso, the city is the warmest region in South Korea due to the humid subtropical climate. This climate condition provides the region with high quality apples and oriental melons. The fruit industry is a crucial support for the local economy. Due to the stagnant economy, Daegu's population began to decrease after 2003. Recently, the local government has begun focusing on working towards economic revival and concentrating on improving the city's fashion industry.\n\n\n=== Fashion industry ===\nBeginning in the late 1990s, Daegu has been actively making efforts to promote its fashion industry based on its textile and clothing manufacturing industries under the 'Daegu: Fashion City'. The city opens many exhibitions related to the fashion and textile industries including the Daegu Fashion Fair and Preview in Daegu annually or semi-annually, and invites national institutes. A large new town specializing in the textile-fashion industries is currently under construction in Bongmu-dong, northeastern Daegu. The district, officially named Esiapolis, takes aim at the fashion hub of East Asia. Textile complexes, textile-fashion institutions, an international school, fashion malls as well as residential areas plan to be developed in the district.\n\n\n== Culture and sightseeing ==\n\nGenerally Daegu is known as a conservative city. As well as being the largest inland city in the country beside Seoul it has become one of the major metropolitan areas in the nation. Traditionally, Buddhism has been strong; today there are still many temples. Confucianism is also popular in Daegu, with a large academy based in the city. Neon cross-topped spires of Christian churches can also be seen in the city.\n\n\n=== Sights ===\nThe most well-known sight of the city is the stone Buddha called Gatbawi on the top of Gwanbong, Palgongsan. It is famous for its stone gat (Korean traditional hat). People from all over the country visit the place, because they believe that the Buddha will grant one's single desire. Administratively, the site itself is located in the neighboring city, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk.\n\nOn the outskirts of the city, mountains keep many traditional temples such as Donghwasa, Pagyesa, and Buinsa. Donghwasa is a Buddhist temple that was built by Priest Geukdal-hwasang in 493, and many artifacts of the period are found around the temple. The International Tourist Zen Meditation Center is Korea's only Zen-themed center. Some lecture halls or memorial halls such as Dodong-seowon (\ub3c4\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9053\u6771\u66f8\u9662) and Nokdong-seowon (\ub179\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0; \u9e7f\u6d1e\u66f8\u9662) are also located in the suburbs.\nOld villages have been preserved, such as the Otgol village (Gyeongju Choi clan's original residence area) and the Inheung village (Nampyeong Mun's). In the urban area, the Joseon Dynasty's administrative or educational buildings including Gyeongsang-gamyeong (\uacbd\uc0c1\uac10\uc601, \u6176\u5c19\u76e3\u71df) and Daegu-hyanggyo (\ub300\uad6c\ud5a5\uad50, \u5927\u90b1\u9115\u6821) also remain. The main gateway of the city in that period called Yeongnam-jeilmun (\uc601\ub0a8\uc81c\uc77c\ubb38, \u5dba\u5357\u7b2c\u4e00\u9580, meaning the first gateway in Yeongnam), has been restored in Mangudang Park. Western style modern architecture like Gyesan Cathedral and the old building of Jeil Church are preserved across the urban area. Gyesan Cathedral is the third oldest gothic church building in Korea and the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Daegu which is one of three archdioceses in South Korea. Several buildings, in the present Keisung Academy and the KNU middle/high school, are famous too.\nYangnyeongsi (\uc57d\ub839\uc2dc, \u85e5\u4ee4\u5e02) in Namseongno (often called Yakjeon-golmok) is the oldest market for Korean medicinal herbs in the country with a history of 350 years. Bongsan-dong which has some art galleries and studios is being developed as the artistic center of the city since the 1990s.\nNearby tourist attractions include Haeinsa\u2014a Buddhist temple that houses the Tripitaka Koreana (a woodblock edition of the Tripitaka and one of the world's oldest extant complete collections of the Buddhist scriptures). Haeinsa is located in Gayasan National Park of Hapcheon, Gyeongnam. The historic city of Gyeongju, Gyeongbuk, the capital of the ancient kingdom of Silla is located east of Daegu.\n\n\n=== Mountains and parks ===\n\nMt. Palgong, Mt. Biseul, and Mt. Ap are the representative mountains in Daegu. Apsan, just in the southern part of the city, is the closest mountain from the urban area among them. It has many trails, Buddhist temples, a Korean War museum, and a gondola ride to the peak. Additionally, Waryongsan, Hamjisan, and Yongjibong are located in the city. These serve as neighborhood parks to the citizens. Mt. Palgong has a cable car to the summit. There are also hiking trails in the direction of the Donghwasa Temple and Sutaegol Valley.\nIn the urban area, several small mountains and hills play the same role. Dalseong Park, which sits inside a 1,500-year-old earth fortress, is a historic place of the city. It contains the city's only zoo and some monuments as well as the wall. Duryu Park or Duryusan is a large forest in the middle of the urban area. It has Daegu Tower, Woobang Land, Kolon Bandstand, Duryu Stadium, and many sports facilities. Daegu Tower, also called Woobang Tower or Duryu Tower, is the tallest contemporary structure (202 m) and a symbol of the city. Its observatory commands good views of the surroundings. Woobang Land is the largest amusement park out of the capital area. Many small gardens lie in the heart of the city, such as the National Debt Repayment Movement Memorial Park (Gukchae Bosang Park) and 2\u00b728 Park. The former park includes Dalgubeol-daejong (\ub2ec\uad6c\ubc8c\ub300\uc885, \u9054\u53e5\u4f10\u5927\u9418), which means the Dalgubeol grand bell. The bell is struck every week and year. There is also a botanical garden with a variety of plants and flowers.\n\n\n=== Downtown and shopping ===\nDongseongno (\ub3d9\uc131\ub85c, \u6771\u57ce\u8def) is the downtown of Daegu lying from the Daegu Station to Jung-ang pachulso (central police station) near the Banwoldang subway station in the center of the city Jung-gu. It has the Jung-angno subway station as the nearest station from its heart. Like its name meaning the street in the east fortress, the eastern part of Daegu-eupseong (\ub300\uad6c\uc74d\uc131, \u5927\u90b1\u9091\u57ce, means the Daegu-Principality Fortress) was situated along this street. The fortress, however, had been demolished in the early 20th century. Although Daegu is the nation's third or fourth largest city, the Dongseongno area form the largest and the broadest downtown area in the whole country except the capital city, Seoul.  In most cases, famous brands open their branch shop first here out of the Greater Seoul area.\n\nSub-downtowns in the city have its own commercial powers and colors. The area around the Seongseo Industrial Complex subway station in Dalseo-gu is a concentration of many amusement spots, and young people easily can be seen around Kyungpook National University in Buk-gu. Deuran-gil (means the street inside the field) in Suseong-gu is known for many restaurants.\nThe city has a number of department stores. Many of these belong to national or multinational chains, but the local Daegu Department Store also operates two branches, while another local chain, Donga Department Store operates four in the city proper. The six department stores among them gather at the downtown. The traditional markets such as Seomun Market and Chilseong Market sell all sorts of goods.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nMany traditional ceremonies and festivals in agrarian society disappeared in the process of modernization.

        "wiki": "The Free State National Botanical Garden, located just outside Bloemfontein covers 70 hectares, and is home to about 400 species of plants, largely native to Free State and Northern Cape Provinces and Lesotho. Near Bain's Vlei, the garden was established in 1965, around 10 km north of downtown between picturesque dolerite rocks. 140 bird species, 50 mammal species, and 50 reptile species live in the park. A wild olive tree (Olea europaea subsp. africana) there is probably more than 200 years old. The herbarium preserves 50,000 species. There is also a bird hide, a dam, and wide lawns.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of botanical gardens in South Africa\n\n\n== External links ==\nSouth African National Biodiversity Institute\nFree State National Botanical Garden Homepage\nwww.places.co.za",

        "wiki": "Bloemfontein (; Afrikaans: [\u02c8blumf\u0254nt\u025bin]; also known as Bloem) is the capital city of the province of Free State of South Africa; and, as the judicial capital of the nation, one of South Africa's three national capitals (the other two being Cape Town, the legislative capital, and Pretoria, the administrative capital) and is the seventh largest city in South Africa. Situated at an elevation of 1,395 m (4,577 ft) above sea level, the city is home to approximately 520,000 residents and forms part of the Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality which has a population of 747,431. It was one of the host cities for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nThe city of Bloemfontein hosts the Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa, the Franklin Game Reserve, Naval Hill, the Maselspoort Resort and the Sand du Plessis Theatre. The city hosts numerous museums, including the National Women's Monument, the Anglo-Boer War Museum, the National Museum, and the Oliewenhuis Art Museum.\nBloemfontein also host sub-Saharan Africa's first digital planetarium, the Naval Hill Planetarium and Boyden Observatory, an astronomical research observatory erected by Harvard University.\nBloemfontein is popularly and poetically known as \"the city of roses\", for its abundance of these flowers and the annual rose festival held there. The city's Sesotho name is Mangaung, meaning \"place of cheetahs\". Its !Orakobab name is \u01c0\u02bcAuxa \u01c3X\u0101s or \u01c0Kx\u02bcauxa \u01c3X\u0101s (Khoekhoegowab spelling: \u01c0Auxa !Kh\u0101s), which refers to Jan Bloem II, known as !X\u0101s-aob or Blumtseb who was a gaokx\u02bcaob (chief) of the \u01c0\u0168di\u01c1\u02bcaes (Springbok Clan) of the !Ora (\"Korana\") nation, whose kraal was the original settlement before the city was built.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe origin of the city's name is disputed. It has been assumed to be from the Dutch words bloem (flower) and fontein (fountain), meaning fountain of flowers. Popular colonial legends include an ox named \"Bloem\" owned by Rudolphus Martinus Brits, one of the pioneer farmers that was taken by a lion near a fountain on his property, while the more likely indigenous history names Jan Bloem II (1775\u20131858), a !Ora (\"Korana\" Khoekhoe) leader who settled there.  His father, Jan Bloem, was a fugitive from the Cape Colony, where he reportedly was escaping arrest after murdering his first wife. Bloem was well known as an expert marksmen, and married into the \u01c0H\u00f5a\u01c1\u02bcaes (Katz clan) and \u01c0\u0168di\u01c1\u02bcaes where he played a role in training !Ora artillery fighters during the first !Ora Wars (a century prior to the second !Ora Wars) on the \u01c2N\u016b!arib (Orange River) in the second half of the 18th century CE. His son was born in 1775 into the Springbok Clan (\u01c0\u0168di\u01c1\u02bcaes), later becoming the kapteijn or chief of this polity.\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThough historically a !Orana settlement, and then a Boer settlement, Bloemfontein was officially founded in 1846 as a fort by British army major Henry Douglas Warden as a British outpost in the Transoranje region, at that stage occupied by various groups of peoples including !Orana (so-called \"Korana\" of the \u01c0H\u00f5a\u01c1\u02bcaes, \u01c0H\u0169di\u01c1\u02bcaes, Eini\u01c1\u02bcaes and others), Cape Colony Trek Boers, Griqua (at that time known as Baasters), and Barolong.\nWarden originally chose the site largely because of its proximity to the main route to Winburg, the spacious open country, and the absence of horse sickness. Bloemfontein was the original farm of Johannes Nicolaas Brits born 21 February 1790, owner and first inhabitant of Bloemfontein. Johann \u2013 as he was known \u2013 sold the farm to Major Warden.With colonial policy shifts, the region changed into the Orange River Sovereignty (1848\u201354) and eventually the Orange Free State Republic (1854\u20131902). From 1902\u201310 it served as the capital of the Orange River Colony and since that time as the provincial capital of the Free State. In 1910 it became the Judicial capital of the Union of South Africa.\n\n\n=== Orange Free State (1854\u20131902) ===\nThe Orange Free State was an independent Boer sovereign republic in southern Africa during the second half of the 19th century. Extending between the Orange and Vaal rivers, its borders were determined by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1848 when the region was proclaimed as the Orange River Sovereignty, with a seat of a British Resident in Bloemfontein.\nAs the capital of the Orange Free State Republic the growth and maturing of the republic resulted in the growth of Bloemfontein. The city constructed numerous public buildings that remain in use today, facilitated by the governance of the republic and compensation from the British for the loss of the diamond rich Griqua Land area. The old Orange Free State's presidential residence the Old Presidency is currently a museum and cultural space in the city.\nA railway line was built in 1890 connecting Bloemfontein to Cape Town.\nThe writer J. R. R. Tolkien was born in the city on 3 January 1892, though his family left Orange Free State (now Free State province, South Africa) following the death of his father, Arthur Tolkien, when Tolkien was three (1895). He recorded that his earliest memories were of \"a hot country\".In 1899 the city was the site of the Bloemfontein Conference, which failed to prevent the outbreak of the Second Boer War. The conference was a final attempt to avert a war between Britain and the South African Republic. With its failure the stage was set for war, which broke out on 11 October 1899.\nThe rail line from Cape Town provided a centrally located railway station, and proved critical to the British in occupying the city later.\nOn 13 March 1900, following the Battle of Paardeberg, British forces captured the city and built a concentration camp nearby to house Boer women and children. The National Women's Monument, on the outskirts of the city, pays homage to the 26,370 women and children as well as 1,421 old men (also 14,154 black people, though some sources feel that the records are unsatisfactory, and that this number could be as high as 20,000) who died in these camps in various parts of the country.The hill in town was named Naval Hill after the naval guns brought in by the British in order to fortify the position against attack.\n\n\n=== Unionisation of South Africa (1910s) ===\nOn 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the Boers signed the Peace Treaty of Vereeniging that ended the Anglo-Boer War between the British Empire and two Boer states, the South African Republic (Republic of Transvaal) and the Orange Free State, South Africa became a Union.Due to disagreements over where the Union's capital should be, a compromise was reached that allowed Bloemfontein to host Appellate Division and become the Union's judicial capital. Bloemfontein was also given financial compensation.On 8 January 1912, the South African Native National Congress (SANNC) was founded in Bloemfontein. The Union of South Africa had not granted rights to black South Africans, causing the organisation's creation. Its primary aim was to fight for the rights of black South Africans.From 1 to 9 January 1914, James Barry Munnik Hertzog and his supporters met in Bloemfontein to form the National Party of the Orange Free State, and to lay down its principles, following Hertzog's exit from the South African Party in 1913. The National Party grew to govern South Africa in 1948 and implement the policy of racial segregation known as apartheid.\n\n\n=== Apartheid era (1948\u20131994) ===\nWhen the National Party won the 1948 South African national government elections they began implementing the policy known as apartheid. The policy was built on white supremacy and racial segregation was implemented. In Bloemfontein, residential segregation had begun in the 19th century with the passing of Ordinance 1 of 1860, which determined that no non-white, without written permission from the landlord, had the right to occupy urban land in towns where local municipalities did not yet exist. On 3 June 1861, the council demarcated three locations in the following areas; the black population was to move to the area which lay to the right of a neighbourhood that was known as Kaffirfontein, Coloureds were to move to the Waaihoek Black residential area on the eastern outskirts of the town. The inhabitants of these settlements had to pay taxes; the so-called hut tax as well as tax on grazing rights. This laid the foundation for the implementation of residential urban segregation as envisaged by the architects of apartheid.\nWhen the South African apartheid government passed the Group Areas Act of 1950, the Bloemfontein municipality put into effect changes in the racial set-up of the city. The municipality demolished the Cape Stands residential area which was occupied by the city's coloured population and moved the residents to Heidedal. However, due to Coloureds living in such close proximity with black people; intermarriages across racial lines occurred, resulting in a partial mixed population in Heidedal and Mangaung. In 1952 the Bloemfontein municipality began building new residential areas for the city's black population. New residential areas to separate ethnic groups such as Sotho, Xhosa and Tswana were formed. The residential areas were jointly known as Mangaung. Phahameng, a Sotho township, was the first formal housing projects to be approved by the municipality in 1956. Physical buffers such as the railway line and roads were put into place to separate black ethnic groups, the white and coloured population.11 000 housing structures, of which approximately 6 000 were government built rental accommodation, were erected in Mangaung between 1952- 1968.In 1968, Mangaung faced serious housing shortages when as many as 3000 to 6000 housing units were needed. To counter this problem, a 55 km east ward expansion called Botshabelo was added in 1979. The Bloemfontein municipality channelled of all black urbanisation to Thaba Nchu and Botshabelo.\nBotshabelo was developed as source of cheap labour for the city of Bloemfontein. A subsidised bus service was established, and Botshabelo was declared decentralisation point. This means that Botshabelo was to become an industrial development point in order to reduce the distance between place of employment and place of residence. In 1988, an approximate 14 500 people were commuting on a daily basis between Botshabelo and Bloemfontein.

          "Even though it was awesome to be able to pet a cheetah, and see quite a variety of other cats, I'm not sure how much conservation is involved here. Got the impression that the focus is more on foreign volunteers who want a \"Cheetah Experience\", rather than the actual protection",

          "I just completed my second time volunteering here and it was even harder to leave. It is a special place indeed. If you are in the area, it is worth it to do a tour and learn more about the animals. You might even get to pet e cheetah and hear him or her purr!",

          "Visited with GB U19 rifle team. We were late to visit due to a delay so couldn't get as much interaction as we would've liked but that was our fault for being late as cuddling wild cats just before feeding is not a good idea! Our tour guide was excellent! She was one of the full",

          "We were there on the 25th of November 2014. We were really blown away by the level of commitment and love all the employees/volunteers have. I think its great that they use volunteers because its people that want to be there and not people driven by the incentive of money. Riana",
          "The staff, though young volunteers and on a quick turn around (each were only there for 2-3 weeks), were surprisingly informed. They were able to explain the character and habits of each cat effectively & explain that the cats were there for protection and breeding purposes.",
          "I have volunteered at CE twice in the past year, and I can't get enough of the place. Amazing experience. It's clear from the start that there is so much love for the animals and they are cared for so well. Whether you want to go as a volunteer for 2 weeks or more, or go as a",

          "Lovely park, enthuisastic guides and beautiful animals. You'll have a lovely time here - it's more like a zoo than a safari, but you get to see some beautiful cats up close (you can touch some of them). Some of the enclosures could do with more to keep the cats entertained,",
          "Absolutely awesome experience. The guided tour is so informative and they seem to have such passion for the animals and for conservation in general. The guide gave not only general facts about the animals, but also about their conservation status and how and why they breed with",
          "What a waste of time and money. We had no interaction with any of the cheetahs. We had to disinfect our hands several times but could not touch any cheetah. According to our tour guide cheetahs are actually stupid animals. One of the 2 meerkats died the day before of pneumonia.",
          "We found out about the Cheetah Experience by accident. What an amazing experience. The amount of work and effort these people put in is amazing. All of the animals looked in great condition. The five lions were the best surprise. This is definitely worth a visit and these people",
          "Spent 10 days volunteering and took away the most enchanting memories I've ever had. The permanent staff is well versed in handling, caring, and protecting both the animals and you. It's a breeding center for endangered African cats with the ultimate mission is to establish a",

          "Volunteered at Cheetah Experience for two weeks (2Sept - 16Sept) and it was the best thing I could have done. When working with the animals you get up close and personal, volunteers get to spend the night with Dew a ten month old cheetah as she doesn't like to sleep alone.",
          "Quite a disappointment from what was promised. We were a group of 20 people paying R300 each for a photography tour and promised interaction with the Cheetahs. The animals were not fed and therefore we could not get close to the cats. We did not touch the cheetahs as promised.",
          "I volunteered at Cheetah Experience for six weeks in July and August 2013. The staff are very knowledgeable, dedicated and care very deeply for the well-being of their animals and the volunteers. The animals are their babies ! The strong bonds they have with their animals",

          "We were very disappointed as we were travelling through Bloemfontein on a Wednesday in February and the place was closed. My son had been very excited the whole 500km we traveled to see the Big Cats. They said it was on account of the weather as it was very hot. Be sure to phone",
          "Getting so close to cheetahs is quite an experience. They seem to be very gentle cats although one remains a bit cautious around them. They also seem to be comfortable around people. Nice experience",

          "You never know what to expect when you go somewhere that keeps big cats (there's always the concerns, are they sedated/cared for properly, are the enclosures clean, are they happy) but I can honestly say that visiting Cheetah Experience was the best thing I did in Bloemfonten.",

The city hosts numerous museums, including the National Women's Monument, the Anglo-Boer War Museum, the National Museum, and the Oliewenhuis Art Museum.\nBloemfontein also host sub-Saharan Africa's first digital planetarium, the Naval Hill Planetarium and Boyden Observatory, an astronomical research observatory erected by Harvard University.\nBloemfontein is popularly and poetically known as \"the city of roses\", for its abundance of these flowers and the annual rose festival held there. The city's Sesotho name is Mangaung, meaning \"place of cheetahs\". Its !Orakobab name is \u01c0\u02bcAuxa \u01c3X\u0101s or \u01c0Kx\u02bcauxa \u01c3X\u0101s (Khoekhoegowab spelling: \u01c0Auxa !Kh\u0101s), which refers to Jan Bloem II, known as !X\u0101s-aob or Blumtseb who was a gaokx\u02bcaob (chief) of the \u01c0\u0168di\u01c1\u02bcaes (Springbok Clan) of the !Ora (\"Korana\") nation, whose kraal was the original settlement before the city was built.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe origin of the city's name is disputed. It has been assumed to be from the Dutch words bloem (flower) and fontein (fountain), meaning fountain of flowers. Popular colonial legends include an ox named \"Bloem\" owned by Rudolphus Martinus Brits, one of the pioneer farmers that was taken by a lion near a fountain on his property, while the more likely indigenous history names Jan Bloem II (1775\u20131858), a !Ora (\"Korana\" Khoekhoe) leader who settled there.  His father, Jan Bloem, was a fugitive from the Cape Colony, where he reportedly was escaping arrest after murdering his first wife. Bloem was well known as an expert marksmen, and married into the \u01c0H\u00f5a\u01c1\u02bcaes (Katz clan) and \u01c0\u0168di\u01c1\u02bcaes where he played a role in training !Ora artillery fighters during the first !Ora Wars (a century prior to the second !Ora Wars) on the \u01c2N\u016b!arib (Orange River) in the second half of the 18th century CE. His son was born in 1775 into the Springbok Clan (\u01c0\u0168di\u01c1\u02bcaes), later becoming the kapteijn or chief of this polity.\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThough historically a !Orana settlement, and then a Boer settlement, Bloemfontein was officially founded in 1846 as a fort by British army major Henry Douglas Warden as a British outpost in the Transoranje region, at that stage occupied by various groups of peoples including !Orana (so-called \"Korana\" of the \u01c0H\u00f5a\u01c1\u02bcaes, \u01c0H\u0169di\u01c1\u02bcaes, Eini\u01c1\u02bcaes and others), Cape Colony Trek Boers, Griqua (at that time known as Baasters), and Barolong.\nWarden originally chose the site largely because of its proximity to the main route to Winburg, the spacious open country, and the absence of horse sickness. Bloemfontein was the original farm of Johannes Nicolaas Brits born 21 February 1790, owner and first inhabitant of Bloemfontein. Johann \u2013 as he was known \u2013 sold the farm to Major Warden.With colonial policy shifts, the region changed into the Orange River Sovereignty (1848\u201354) and eventually the Orange Free State Republic (1854\u20131902). From 1902\u201310 it served as the capital of the Orange River Colony and since that time as the provincial capital of the Free State. In 1910 it became the Judicial capital of the Union of South Africa.\n\n\n=== Orange Free State (1854\u20131902) ===\nThe Orange Free State was an independent Boer sovereign republic in southern Africa during the second half of the 19th century. Extending between the Orange and Vaal rivers, its borders were determined by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1848 when the region was proclaimed as the Orange River Sovereignty, with a seat of a British Resident in Bloemfontein.\nAs the capital of the Orange Free State Republic the growth and maturing of the republic resulted in the growth of Bloemfontein. The city constructed numerous public buildings that remain in use today, facilitated by the governance of the republic and compensation from the British for the loss of the diamond rich Griqua Land area. The old Orange Free State's presidential residence the Old Presidency is currently a museum and cultural space in the city.\nA railway line was built in 1890 connecting Bloemfontein to Cape Town.\nThe writer J. R. R. Tolkien was born in the city on 3 January 1892, though his family left Orange Free State (now Free State province, South Africa) following the death of his father, Arthur Tolkien, when Tolkien was three (1895). He recorded that his earliest memories were of \"a hot country\".In 1899 the city was the site of the Bloemfontein Conference, which failed to prevent the outbreak of the Second Boer War. The conference was a final attempt to avert a war between Britain and the South African Republic. With its failure the stage was set for war, which broke out on 11 October 1899.\nThe rail line from Cape Town provided a centrally located railway station, and proved critical to the British in occupying the city later.\nOn 13 March 1900, following the Battle of Paardeberg, British forces captured the city and built a concentration camp nearby to house Boer women and children. The National Women's Monument, on the outskirts of the city, pays homage to the 26,370 women and children as well as 1,421 old men (also 14,154 black people, though some sources feel that the records are unsatisfactory, and that this number could be as high as 20,000) who died in these camps in various parts of the country.The hill in town was named Naval Hill after the naval guns brought in by the British in order to fortify the position against attack.\n\n\n=== Unionisation of South Africa (1910s) ===\nOn 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the Boers signed the Peace Treaty of Vereeniging that ended the Anglo-Boer War between the British Empire and two Boer states, the South African Republic (Republic of Transvaal) and the Orange Free State, South Africa became a Union.Due to disagreements over where the Union's capital should be, a compromise was reached that allowed Bloemfontein to host Appellate Division and become the Union's judicial capital. Bloemfontein was also given financial compensation.On 8 January 1912, the South African Native National Congress (SANNC) was founded in Bloemfontein. The Union of South Africa had not granted rights to black South Africans, causing the organisation's creation. Its primary aim was to fight for the rights of black South Africans.From 1 to 9 January 1914, James Barry Munnik Hertzog and his supporters met in Bloemfontein to form the National Party of the Orange Free State, and to lay down its principles, following Hertzog's exit from the South African Party in 1913. The National Party grew to govern South Africa in 1948 and implement the policy of racial segregation known as apartheid.\n\n\n=== Apartheid era (1948\u20131994) ===\nWhen the National Party won the 1948 South African national government elections they began implementing the policy known as apartheid. The policy was built on white supremacy and racial segregation was implemented. In Bloemfontein, residential segregation had begun in the 19th century with the passing of Ordinance 1 of 1860, which determined that no non-white, without written permission from the landlord, had the right to occupy urban land in towns where local municipalities did not yet exist. On 3 June 1861, the council demarcated three locations in the following areas; the black population was to move to the area which lay to the right of a neighbourhood that was known as Kaffirfontein, Coloureds were to move to the Waaihoek Black residential area on the eastern outskirts of the town. The inhabitants of these settlements had to pay taxes; the so-called hut tax as well as tax on grazing rights. This laid the foundation for the implementation of residential urban segregation as envisaged by the architects of apartheid.\nWhen the South African apartheid government passed the Group Areas Act of 1950, the Bloemfontein municipality put into effect changes in the racial set-up of the city. The municipality demolished the Cape Stands residential area which was occupied by the city's coloured population and moved the residents to Heidedal. However, due to Coloureds living in such close proximity with black people; intermarriages across racial lines occurred, resulting in a partial mixed population in Heidedal and Mangaung. In 1952 the Bloemfontein municipality began building new residential areas for the city's black population. New residential areas to separate ethnic groups such as Sotho, Xhosa and Tswana were formed. The residential areas were jointly known as Mangaung. Phahameng, a Sotho township, was the first formal housing projects to be approved by the municipality in 1956. Physical buffers such as the railway line and roads were put into place to separate black ethnic groups, the white and coloured population.11 000 housing structures, of which approximately 6 000 were government built rental accommodation, were erected in Mangaung between 1952- 1968.In 1968, Mangaung faced serious housing shortages when as many as 3000 to 6000 housing units were needed. To counter this problem, a 55 km east ward expansion called Botshabelo was added in 1979. The Bloemfontein municipality channelled of all black urbanisation to Thaba Nchu and Botshabelo.\nBotshabelo was developed as source of cheap labour for the city of Bloemfontein. A subsidised bus service was established, and Botshabelo was declared decentralisation point. This means that Botshabelo was to become an industrial development point in order to reduce the distance between place of employment and place of residence. In 1988, an approximate 14 500 people were commuting on a daily basis between Botshabelo and Bloemfontein. This meant that 55% of Botshabelo's work force was employed outside the city.In 1994, after the disestablishment of the apartheid government, Bloemfontein, Botshabelo, and Thaba Nchu became part of Motheo District Municipality. The Motheo District Municipality was disestablished on 18 May 2011 and Mangaung was upgraded to become an autonomous metropolitan municipality with Bloemfontein as the main seat.\n\n\n=== Since 1994 ===\nUntil 1994 the city was the sole judicial capital of South Africa.

Voters get two votes: one for a representative to become a ward councillor and the other for a political party. The latter vote is used to distribute seats in the municipal council amongst parties while the former distributes seats through the individual representatives. The current Executive Mayor of Mangaung, Olly Mlamleli, was elected in August 2016.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\nBloemfontein is located in central South Africa on the southern edge of the Highveld at an elevation of 1,400 metres (4,600 ft), bordering on the semi-arid region of the Karoo.

          "An interesting place to go, certainly. It portrays the Anglo Boer War entirely from the viewpoint of the Boer people. It used to be called the \"War Museum of the Boer Republics\" but that seems to have been changed. The building was clearly built with no expense spared and there",
          "We did not visit the museum, however stayed outside in the 'garden of remembrance' for approx. 1 hour and that is more than enough to get an impression of the women and children who died in the concentration camps and in the field during the South African War (Anglo-Boer War).",

          "There is probably no place in South Africa that better explained the events that shaped the Afrikaner view of the nation. The museum is inextricably linked to the Women's Monument, dedicated to those who perished in British concentration camps during the Anglo Boer War.",
          "Great layout and very informative - 'a must-see' for all. Lots of information that most of us do not know about the war.",

          "Was in a big group, though there was no problems with this and found the the museum was full of interesting displays, the boar war was something that is not often mentioned in the UK and was interesting to see the war covered by the over perspective.",
          "There is a great deal about the Anglo-Boer War and a large number of artifacts. It is clear why Afrikaners still harbor many resentments against the English. The museum and the guide all are from the perspective that all the right was on the Afrikaner (Boer) side. It is well",
          "It was a great museum, very informative. The layout was a bit confusing but the information was great. The women and children were the main victims here.",

          "In addition to the Woman's memorial this is my most favourite Monument and Museum in the entire country. The sculptures come alive with the proffessional narrative by the Guide, and the stories all evoke a compassionate story of the Boer War!",
          "During your visit to Bloemfontein you need to visit the Anglo Boer War Museum to kwoledge yourself about the History of the Boer culture. The setting and sculputers are out of this world and the tour guides briefing you wth such passion of the History",

        "wiki": "Grey College (Afrikaans: Grey Kollege) is a public English & Afrikaans medium school for boys situated in the suburb of Universitas in Bloemfontein in the Free State province of South Africa, it is one of the 23 Milner Schools, It's one of the top and most academic schools in the Free State province. The sister school is Eunice High School (Bloemfontein).\nGrey College was ranked 1st out of the top 100 best high schools in Africa by Africa Almanac in 2003 and 2013, based upon quality of education, student engagement, strength and activities of alumni, school profile, internet and news visibility.\n\n\n== History ==\nGrey College was founded on 13 October 1855 when Sir George Grey, the then Governor of the Cape Colony, paid a visit to the Orange Free State Republic and donated a sum of money towards the establishment of a school in Bloemfontein. The foundation stone was laid by Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff, the second President of the Orange Free State Republic, on 13 October 1856.\nThe school was officially opened on 17 January 1859 and the first headmaster was the Reverend Andrew Murray. It is the third-oldest school in South Africa and the oldest north of the Orange River.During his presidential inauguration speech in 1896, while addressing learners from Grey College, Marthinus Theunis Steyn mentioned that he envisioned a university for Bloemfontein where youth from all over the country could come and study. He supported the idea that Grey College should provide higher education to the people of the Orange Free State. As a result the University of the Free State essentially came into existence in 1904 when a tertiary portion of Grey College were allocated for such purpose.The college first accepted matriculants for a full B.A. course in 1904. In 1906 the tertiary part of Grey College became known as the Grey University College (GUC), but shortly thereafter the school and college separated. GUC grew and evolved into the institution now called the University of the Free State.\nAfrikaans- and English-speaking pupils study under one roof, but each language group is educated in separate classrooms and in its own mother tongue.\n\n\n== Grey College today ==\nThe school grounds consist of a number of historic buildings, of which five are Free State provincial heritage sites: the Main building and Hamilton Hall, the Andrew Murray House, the Brill House and the Tuck shop.Extensive sport facilities includes an Olympic-sized swimming pool, a hockey astro, squash courts and several hockey, soccer, cricket and rugby fields. The school also has 16 all-weather tennis courts.\nThe school celebrated its 150th jubilee during October 2005, when numerous alumni visited their alma mater. The current headmaster at the High School is Deon Scheepers and the headmaster of the Primary School is Jurie Geldenhuys. A Museum which houses memorable artifacts, such as old rugby jerseys, and paintings, was unveiled in 2005. Each year on 13 October many old-boys hold a reunion.\nIn 2001 the school won the Sanix World Rugby Youth Tournament.\nA trademark of the school is the unique handshake, widely recognized and used by students, old boys and members of staff.\nThe school offers a number of scholarships such as the Badawi Legacy scholarship given in partnership with Montpellier Rugby Club to promote rugby, education and French culture.  Old Greys donate funds to the Jock Meiring Trust and Bram Fisher Trust, funds used for the administration of school grounds and granting of scholarships..\n\n\n== Sports ==\nGrey College has been performing very well on sports during the year. \n\nAthletics\nCricket\nCross Country\nCycling\nFootball\nHockey\nGolf\nRowing\nRugby\nShooting\nSquash\nSwimming\nTennis\nWater polo\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notable alumni ==\nLaurens van der Post Sir Laurens van der Post was political adviser to British heads of government, close friend of Prince Charles, godfather of Prince William, educator, journalist, humanitarian, philosopher, explorer and conservationist.\nProf. Ernst Oswald Johannes Westphal, internationally renowned linguist and scholar, of the School of Oriental and African Studies and the University of Cape Town.\nJopie Fourie, military scout & dispatch rider\nEtienne Leroux, Influential Afrikaans author and a key member of the South African Sestigers literary movement.\nCharl du Plessis, Internationally renowned pianist.\nLouis Brabow, Springboks rugby player.\nHeinrich Br\u00fcssow, Springboks rugby player\nHansie Cronj\u00e9, former South African cricket captain, whose ashes are kept at the school\nJohan Cronj\u00e9, South African Olympic Athlete\nBreda van Reenen, world's famous cutting horse trainer\nNaka Drotsk\u00e9, Rugby World Cup 1995 winning Springboks team\nBismarck du Plessis, Springboks rugby player\nJannie du Plessis, Springboks rugby player;

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The National Women's Monument (Afrikaans: Nasionale Vrouemonument) in Bloemfontein, South Africa, is a monument commemorating the suffering of some 27,000 Boer women and children who died in British concentration camps during the Second Boer War.  The Monument is a Provincial Heritage Site in the Free State.\nThe monument was designed by a Pretoria architect, Frans Soff, and the sculpting by Anton van Wouw.  It consists of an obelisk about 35m in height and low, semi-circular walls on two sides. A central bronze group, sketched by Emily Hobhouse and  depicting her own experience of 15 May 1901, is of two sorrowing women and a dying child in the Springfontein camp. The monument was unveiled on 16 December 1913, attended by about 20,000 South Africans. Thirteen years later, Emily Hobhouse's ashes were ensconced at the foot of the monument. Also beside the monument are the graves of Christiaan de Wet, Rev. John Daniel Kestell, President of the Orange Free State Martinus Steyn, and his wife.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nThe idea of a monument was expressed by Martinus Steyn, then president of the Orange Free State Republic, whilst receiving medical treatment in Europe after the Boer War. His wife, Rachel Isabella \"Tibbie\" Steyn, played a part in the concept, having lost family and friends in the concentration camps. She also had close ties with Emily Hobhouse. On his return to South Africa, Steyn set up an action committee to launch the project. The notion of constructing a school or hospital was rejected as lacking inspiration, a view which gained support from a number of Afrikaner organizations.\n\u00a310,000 of funding for the monument came from the Afrikaner community over a period of four years from 1907 to 1911. The start of construction was delayed by English-speaking members of the Bloemfontein Town Council, who felt the memorial would reflect poorly on Great Britain and by extension on the locals who had supported the war.Prime Minister Louis Botha, who had embarked on a mission of reconciliation after the war, also disapproved of the memorial. This also lead to accusations made that the monument was built, broken down and rebuilt.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe monument is around 3 km south of central Bloemfontein. Against the backdrop of the surrounding hills, the monument blends in well to the local farm community and therefore to the Boer lifestyle memorialized there.\n\n\n== Description ==\nA circular shelter (screen wall) around 35 m high surrounds the central obelisk.\n\n\n=== Sculpture group ===\nThe sculpture group includes a woman without her bonnet, with her emaciated, dying child in her lap. A second woman goes to the distance, calling on the Lord to see the tragedy.\nThe inspiration for the scene was described in a poignant way by Hobhouse, referring to a scene in Springfontein where a woman would not look at her starving child, experiencing a pain beyond all tears. A second message comes from the child's eyes: her child is dead, but her willpower is not dead and her people is not extinct.\nHobhouse (a woman of many talents) did not hold Van Wouw in high regard as a sculptor and spoke critically of the final product. She held that images did not do justice to the pitiful scene portrayed, feeling the child looks asleep rather than at death's door.\n\n\n=== Significance ===\nThe Women's Monument enjoyed great popularity, but was eventually overshadowed by the Voortrekker Monument, erected 36 years later in Pretoria on December 16, 1949, as a national symobl. The Voortrekker Monument came a year after the victory of the National Party in the 1948 South African general election and coincided with the centennial of the Great Trek. In contrast, the controversy surrounding the Women's Monument delayed its recognition on a national scale.\n\n\n== School use of the monument ==\nThe students of C&N Sekond\u00eare Meisieskool Oranje (\"C&N Girls' Secondary School Orange\") in Bloemfontein visit the school annually in memory of president Steyn and its historical significance. The visit is a 10-km hike from the school to the monument. Wreaths are laid by Steyn's grave, and several ceremonies are held as students pledge to develop the potential of their Afrikaner, Christian heritage.\n\n\n== Later embellishments ==\nThe aesthetic scope of the monument widened over time. Initially, no men were depicted, but with the burial of Steyn at the foot of the structure, a new era of commemorations began, eventually bringing a war memorial into the area. Tibbie Steyn expressed concern that the use of the grounds of the monument for burials of war veterans would dilute the original focus on the suffering of women and children. Despite her protestations, she was buried in 1955 alongside her husband by Dr. D.F. Malan, a year after having retired as Prime Minister of South Africa. Malan declared her the last link to the original Boer Republics. Since 1960, other memorials of the Second Boer War have been erected on the Women's Monument grounds, making the monument one of the primary sites dedicated to the war's legacy. Cultural institutions used surrounding plots of land to commemorate civilians, volunteers, POWs, and Bittereinders. While complementary to the Women's Monument, they confirmed the shift in emphasis.\n\n\n== Phallic symbol ==\nModern critics have referred to the obelisk as a phallic symbol, belying the ostensible focus of the monument. Designed by men on the inspiration of a woman's words, the contrast remains a potent subject of debate.\n\n\n== Nearby institutions ==\nThe Anglo-Boer War Museum is permanently located on the same premises.\n\n\n== Graves by the monument ==\nSteyn, 1916\nHobhouse, 1926\nDe Wet, 1922\nKstell, 1941\nTibbie Steyn, 1955\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGrundlingh, Albert. \"The National Women's Monument.

        "wiki": "Bloemfontein (; Afrikaans: [\u02c8blumf\u0254nt\u025bin]; also known as Bloem) is the capital city of the province of Free State of South Africa; and, as the judicial capital of the nation, one of South Africa's three national capitals (the other two being Cape Town, the legislative capital, and Pretoria, the administrative capital) and is the seventh largest city in South Africa. Situated at an elevation of 1,395 m (4,577 ft) above sea level, the city is home to approximately 520,000 residents and forms part of the Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality which has a population of 747,431. It was one of the host cities for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nThe city of Bloemfontein hosts the Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa, the Franklin Game Reserve, Naval Hill, the Maselspoort Resort and the Sand du Plessis Theatre. The city hosts numerous museums, including the National Women's Monument, the Anglo-Boer War Museum, the National Museum, and the Oliewenhuis Art Museum.\nBloemfontein also host sub-Saharan Africa's first digital planetarium, the Naval Hill Planetarium and Boyden Observatory, an astronomical research observatory erected by Harvard University.\nBloemfontein is popularly and poetically known as \"the city of roses\", for its abundance of these flowers and the annual rose festival held there. The city's Sesotho name is Mangaung, meaning \"place of cheetahs\". Its !Orakobab name is \u01c0\u02bcAuxa \u01c3X\u0101s or \u01c0Kx\u02bcauxa \u01c3X\u0101s (Khoekhoegowab spelling: \u01c0Auxa !Kh\u0101s), which refers to Jan Bloem II, known as !X\u0101s-aob or Blumtseb who was a gaokx\u02bcaob (chief) of the \u01c0\u0168di\u01c1\u02bcaes (Springbok Clan) of the !Ora (\"Korana\") nation, whose kraal was the original settlement before the city was built.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe origin of the city's name is disputed. It has been assumed to be from the Dutch words bloem (flower) and fontein (fountain), meaning fountain of flowers. Popular colonial legends include an ox named \"Bloem\" owned by Rudolphus Martinus Brits, one of the pioneer farmers that was taken by a lion near a fountain on his property, while the more likely indigenous history names Jan Bloem II (1775\u20131858), a !Ora (\"Korana\" Khoekhoe) leader who settled there.  His father, Jan Bloem, was a fugitive from the Cape Colony, where he reportedly was escaping arrest after murdering his first wife. Bloem was well known as an expert marksmen, and married into the \u01c0H\u00f5a\u01c1\u02bcaes (Katz clan) and \u01c0\u0168di\u01c1\u02bcaes where he played a role in training !Ora artillery fighters during the first !Ora Wars (a century prior to the second !Ora Wars) on the \u01c2N\u016b!arib (Orange River) in the second half of the 18th century CE. His son was born in 1775 into the Springbok Clan (\u01c0\u0168di\u01c1\u02bcaes), later becoming the kapteijn or chief of this polity.\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThough historically a !Orana settlement, and then a Boer settlement, Bloemfontein was officially founded in 1846 as a fort by British army major Henry Douglas Warden as a British outpost in the Transoranje region, at that stage occupied by various groups of peoples including !Orana (so-called \"Korana\" of the \u01c0H\u00f5a\u01c1\u02bcaes, \u01c0H\u0169di\u01c1\u02bcaes, Eini\u01c1\u02bcaes and others), Cape Colony Trek Boers, Griqua (at that time known as Baasters), and Barolong.\nWarden originally chose the site largely because of its proximity to the main route to Winburg, the spacious open country, and the absence of horse sickness. Bloemfontein was the original farm of Johannes Nicolaas Brits born 21 February 1790, owner and first inhabitant of Bloemfontein. Johann \u2013 as he was known \u2013 sold the farm to Major Warden.With colonial policy shifts, the region changed into the Orange River Sovereignty (1848\u201354) and eventually the Orange Free State Republic (1854\u20131902). From 1902\u201310 it served as the capital of the Orange River Colony and since that time as the provincial capital of the Free State. In 1910 it became the Judicial capital of the Union of South Africa.\n\n\n=== Orange Free State (1854\u20131902) ===\nThe Orange Free State was an independent Boer sovereign republic in southern Africa during the second half of the 19th century. Extending between the Orange and Vaal rivers, its borders were determined by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1848 when the region was proclaimed as the Orange River Sovereignty, with a seat of a British Resident in Bloemfontein.\nAs the capital of the Orange Free State Republic the growth and maturing of the republic resulted in the growth of Bloemfontein. The city constructed numerous public buildings that remain in use today, facilitated by the governance of the republic and compensation from the British for the loss of the diamond rich Griqua Land area. The old Orange Free State's presidential residence the Old Presidency is currently a museum and cultural space in the city.\nA railway line was built in 1890 connecting Bloemfontein to Cape Town.\nThe writer J. R. R. Tolkien was born in the city on 3 January 1892, though his family left Orange Free State (now Free State province, South Africa) following the death of his father, Arthur Tolkien, when Tolkien was three (1895). He recorded that his earliest memories were of \"a hot country\".In 1899 the city was the site of the Bloemfontein Conference, which failed to prevent the outbreak of the Second Boer War. The conference was a final attempt to avert a war between Britain and the South African Republic. With its failure the stage was set for war, which broke out on 11 October 1899.\nThe rail line from Cape Town provided a centrally located railway station, and proved critical to the British in occupying the city later.\nOn 13 March 1900, following the Battle of Paardeberg, British forces captured the city and built a concentration camp nearby to house Boer women and children. The National Women's Monument, on the outskirts of the city, pays homage to the 26,370 women and children as well as 1,421 old men (also 14,154 black people, though some sources feel that the records are unsatisfactory, and that this number could be as high as 20,000) who died in these camps in various parts of the country.The hill in town was named Naval Hill after the naval guns brought in by the British in order to fortify the position against attack.\n\n\n=== Unionisation of South Africa (1910s) ===\nOn 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the Boers signed the Peace Treaty of Vereeniging that ended the Anglo-Boer War between the British Empire and two Boer states, the South African Republic (Republic of Transvaal) and the Orange Free State, South Africa became a Union.Due to disagreements over where the Union's capital should be, a compromise was reached that allowed Bloemfontein to host Appellate Division and become the Union's judicial capital. Bloemfontein was also given financial compensation.On 8 January 1912, the South African Native National Congress (SANNC) was founded in Bloemfontein. The Union of South Africa had not granted rights to black South Africans, causing the organisation's creation. Its primary aim was to fight for the rights of black South Africans.From 1 to 9 January 1914, James Barry Munnik Hertzog and his supporters met in Bloemfontein to form the National Party of the Orange Free State, and to lay down its principles, following Hertzog's exit from the South African Party in 1913. The National Party grew to govern South Africa in 1948 and implement the policy of racial segregation known as apartheid.\n\n\n=== Apartheid era (1948\u20131994) ===\nWhen the National Party won the 1948 South African national government elections they began implementing the policy known as apartheid. The policy was built on white supremacy and racial segregation was implemented. In Bloemfontein, residential segregation had begun in the 19th century with the passing of Ordinance 1 of 1860, which determined that no non-white, without written permission from the landlord, had the right to occupy urban land in towns where local municipalities did not yet exist. On 3 June 1861, the council demarcated three locations in the following areas; the black population was to move to the area which lay to the right of a neighbourhood that was known as Kaffirfontein, Coloureds were to move to the Waaihoek Black residential area on the eastern outskirts of the town. The inhabitants of these settlements had to pay taxes; the so-called hut tax as well as tax on grazing rights. This laid the foundation for the implementation of residential urban segregation as envisaged by the architects of apartheid.\nWhen the South African apartheid government passed the Group Areas Act of 1950, the Bloemfontein municipality put into effect changes in the racial set-up of the city. The municipality demolished the Cape Stands residential area which was occupied by the city's coloured population and moved the residents to Heidedal. However, due to Coloureds living in such close proximity with black people; intermarriages across racial lines occurred, resulting in a partial mixed population in Heidedal and Mangaung. In 1952 the Bloemfontein municipality began building new residential areas for the city's black population. New residential areas to separate ethnic groups such as Sotho, Xhosa and Tswana were formed. The residential areas were jointly known as Mangaung. Phahameng, a Sotho township, was the first formal housing projects to be approved by the municipality in 1956. Physical buffers such as the railway line and roads were put into place to separate black ethnic groups, the white and coloured population.11 000 housing structures, of which approximately 6 000 were government built rental accommodation, were erected in Mangaung between 1952- 1968.In 1968, Mangaung faced serious housing shortages when as many as 3000 to 6000 housing units were needed. To counter this problem, a 55 km east ward expansion called Botshabelo was added in 1979. The Bloemfontein municipality channelled of all black urbanisation to Thaba Nchu and Botshabelo.\nBotshabelo was developed as source of cheap labour for the city of Bloemfontein. A subsidised bus service was established, and Botshabelo was declared decentralisation point. This means that Botshabelo was to become an industrial development point in order to reduce the distance between place of employment and place of residence. In 1988, an approximate 14 500 people were commuting on a daily basis between Botshabelo and Bloemfontein. This meant that 55% of Botshabelo's work force was employed outside the city.In 1994, after the disestablishment of the apartheid government, Bloemfontein, Botshabelo, and Thaba Nchu became part of Motheo District Municipality. The Motheo District Municipality was disestablished on 18 May 2011 and Mangaung was upgraded to become an autonomous metropolitan municipality with Bloemfontein as the main seat.\n\n\n=== Since 1994 ===\nUntil 1994 the city was the sole judicial capital of South Africa. It remains the seat for the Supreme Court of Appeal (formerly the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court). It is also an administrative centre with many private hospitals and educational institutions.\n\n\n== Government ==\nFree State Provincial Government building\nBloemfontein forms part of the Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality, which was upgraded from a Local Municipality in 2011.\nThe Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality elects a municipal council for five-year periods, through a mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) system in which wards elect individual councillors alongside those named from party lists. Voters get two votes: one for a representative to become a ward councillor and the other for a political party. The latter vote is used to distribute seats in the municipal council amongst parties while the former distributes seats through the individual representatives. The current Executive Mayor of Mangaung, Olly Mlamleli, was elected in August 2016.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\nBloemfontein is located in central South Africa on the southern edge of the Highveld at an elevation of 1,400 metres (4,600 ft), bordering on the semi-arid region of the Karoo.

        "wiki": "Jacques-Yves Cousteau,  (, also UK: , French: [\u0292ak iv kusto]; 11 June 1910 \u2013 25 June 1997) was a French naval officer, explorer, conservationist, filmmaker, innovator, scientist, photographer, author and researcher who studied the sea and all forms of life in water. He co-developed the Aqua-Lung, pioneered marine conservation and was a member of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise.\nCousteau described his underwater world research in a series of books, perhaps the most successful being his first book, The Silent World: A Story of Undersea Discovery and Adventure, published in 1953. Cousteau also directed films, most notably the documentary adaptation of the book, The Silent World, which won a Palme d'or at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival. He remained the only person to win a Palme d'Or for a documentary film, until Michael Moore won the award in 2004 for Fahrenheit 9/11.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nCousteau was born on 11 June 1910, in Saint-Andr\u00e9-de-Cubzac, Gironde, France, to Daniel and \u00c9lisabeth Cousteau. He had one brother, Pierre-Antoine. Cousteau completed his preparatory studies at the Coll\u00e8ge Stanislas in Paris. In 1930, he entered the \u00c9cole Navale and graduated as a gunnery officer. However, an automobile accident, which broke both his arms, cut short his career in naval aviation. The accident forced Cousteau to change his plans to become a naval pilot, so he then indulged his passion for the ocean.In Toulon, where he was serving on the Condorcet, Cousteau carried out his first underwater experiments, thanks to his friend Philippe Tailliez who in 1936 lent him some Fernez underwater goggles, predecessors of modern swimming goggles. Cousteau also belonged to the information service of the French Navy, and was sent on missions to Shanghai and Japan (1935\u20131938) and in the USSR (1939).On 12 July 1937 he married Simone Melchior, with whom he had two sons, Jean-Michel (born 1938) and Philippe (1940\u20131979). His sons took part in the adventures of the Calypso. In 1991, one year after his wife Simone's death from cancer, he married Francine Triplet. They already had a daughter Diane Cousteau (born 1980) and a son, Pierre-Yves Cousteau (born 1982), born during Cousteau's marriage to his first wife.\n\n\n=== Early 1940s: innovation of modern underwater diving ===\nThe years of World War II were decisive for the history of diving. After the armistice of 1940, the family of Simone and Jacques-Yves Cousteau took refuge in Meg\u00e8ve, where he became a friend of the Ichac family who also lived there. Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Marcel Ichac shared the same desire to reveal to the general public unknown and inaccessible places \u2014 for Cousteau the underwater world and for Ichac the high mountains. The two neighbors took the first ex-aequo prize of the Congress of Documentary Film in 1943, for the first French underwater film: Par dix-huit m\u00e8tres de fond (18 meters deep), made without breathing apparatus the previous year in the Embiez islands in Var, with Philippe Tailliez and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dumas, using a depth-pressure-proof camera case developed by mechanical engineer L\u00e9on V\u00e8che an engineer of Arts and Measures at the Naval College.\nIn 1943, they made the film \u00c9paves (Shipwrecks), in which they used two of the very first Aqua-Lung prototypes. These prototypes were made in Boulogne-Billancourt by the Air Liquide company, following instructions from Cousteau and \u00c9mile Gagnan. When making \u00c9paves, Cousteau could not find the necessary blank reels of movie film, but had to buy hundreds of small still camera film reels the same width, intended for a make of child's camera, and cemented them together to make long reels.Having kept bonds with the English speakers (he spent part of his childhood in the United States and usually spoke English) and with French soldiers in North Africa (under Admiral Lemonnier), Jacques-Yves Cousteau (whose villa \"Baobab\" at Sanary (Var) was opposite Admiral Darlan's villa \"Reine\"), helped the French Navy to join again with the Allies; he assembled a commando operation against the Italian espionage services in France, and received several military decorations for his deeds. At that time, he kept his distance from his brother Pierre-Antoine Cousteau, a \"pen anti-semite\" who wrote the collaborationist newspaper Je suis partout (I am everywhere) and who received the death sentence in 1946. However, this was later commuted to a life sentence, and Pierre-Antoine was released in 1954.\nDuring the 1940s, Cousteau is credited with improving the Aqua-Lung design which gave birth to the open-circuit scuba technology used today. According to his first book, The Silent World: A Story of Undersea Discovery and Adventure (1953), Cousteau started diving with Fernez goggles in 1936, and in 1939 used the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus invented in 1926 by Commander Yves le Prieur. Cousteau was not satisfied with the length of time he could spend underwater with the Le Prieur apparatus so he improved it to extend underwater duration by adding a demand regulator, invented in 1942 by \u00c9mile Gagnan. In 1943 Cousteau tried out the first prototype Aqua-Lung which finally made extended underwater exploration possible.\n\n\n=== Late 1940s: GERS and \u00c9lie Monnier ===\nIn 1946, Cousteau and Tailliez showed the film \u00c9paves (\"Shipwrecks\") to Admiral Lemonnier, who gave them the responsibility of setting up the Groupement de Recherches Sous-marines (GRS) (Underwater Research Group) of the French Navy in Toulon. A little later it became the GERS (Groupe d'\u00c9tudes et de Recherches Sous-Marines, = Underwater Studies and Research Group), then the COMISMER (\"COMmandement des Interventions Sous la MER\", = \"Undersea Interventions Command\"), and finally more recently the CEPHISMER. In 1947, Chief Petty Officer Maurice Fargues became the first diver to die using an aqualung, while attempting a new depth record with the GERS near Toulon.In 1948, between missions of mine clearance, underwater exploration and technological and physiological tests, Cousteau undertook a first campaign in the Mediterranean on board the sloop \u00c9lie Monnier, with Philippe Tailliez, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dumas, Jean Alinat and the scenario writer Marcel Ichac. The small team also undertook the exploration of the Roman wreck of Mahdia (Tunisia). It was the first underwater archaeology operation using autonomous diving, opening the way for scientific underwater archaeology. Cousteau and Marcel Ichac brought back from there the Carnets diving film (presented and preceded with the Cannes Film Festival 1951).\nCousteau and the \u00c9lie Monnier then took part in the rescue of Professor Jacques Piccard's bathyscaphe, the FNRS-2, during the 1949 expedition to Dakar. Thanks to this rescue, the French Navy was able to reuse the sphere of the bathyscaphe to construct the FNRS-3.\nThe adventures of this period are told in the two books The Silent World (1953, by Cousteau and Dumas) and Plong\u00e9es sans c\u00e2ble (1954, by Philippe Tailliez).\n\n\n=== 1950\u20131970s ===\nIn 1949, Cousteau left the French Navy.\nIn 1950, he founded the French Oceanographic Campaigns (FOC), and leased a ship called Calypso from Thomas Loel Guinness for a symbolic one franc a year. Cousteau refitted the Calypso as a mobile laboratory for field research and as his principal vessel for diving and filming. He also carried out underwater archaeological excavations in the Mediterranean, in particular at Grand-Conglou\u00e9 (1952).\nWith the publication of his first book in 1953, The Silent World, he correctly predicted the existence of the echolocation abilities of porpoises. He reported that his research vessel, the \u00c9lie Monier, was heading to the Straits of Gibraltar and noticed a group of porpoises following them. Cousteau changed course a few degrees off the optimal course to the center of the strait, and the porpoises followed for a few minutes, then diverged toward mid-channel again. It was evident that they knew where the optimal course lay, even if the humans did not. Cousteau concluded that the cetaceans had something like sonar, which was a relatively new feature on submarines.\nIn 1954, Cousteau conducted a survey of Abu Dhabi waters on behalf of British Petroleum. Among those accompanying him was Louis Malle who made a black-and-white film of the expedition for the company. Cousteau won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1956 for The Silent World co-produced with Malle. In 1957, Cousteau took over as leader of the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco. Afterward, with the assistance of Jean Mollard, he made a \"diving saucer\" SP-350, an experimental underwater vehicle which could reach a depth of 350 meters. The successful experiment was quickly repeated in 1965 with two vehicles which reached 500 meters.\nIn 1957, he was elected as director of the Oceanographical Museum of Monaco. He directed Pr\u00e9continent, about the experiments of diving in saturation (long-duration immersion, houses under the sea), and was admitted to the United States National Academy of Sciences.\nHe was involved in the creation of Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Mondiale des Activit\u00e9s Subaquatiques and served as its inaugural president from 1959 to 1973.Cousteau also took part in inventing the \"SP-350 Denise Diving Saucer\" in 1959 which was an invention best for exploring the ocean floor, as it allowed one to explore on solid ground.In October 1960, a large amount of radioactive waste was going to be discarded in the Mediterranean Sea by the Commissariat \u00e0 l'\u00e9nergie atomique (CEA). The CEA argued that the dumps were experimental in nature, and that French oceanographers such as Vsevelod Romanovsky had recommended it. Romanovsky and other French scientists, including Louis Fage and Jacques Cousteau, repudiated the claim, saying that Romanovsky had in mind a much smaller amount. The CEA claimed that there was little circulation (and hence little need for concern) at the dump site between Nice and Corsica, but French public opinion sided with the oceanographers rather than with the CEA atomic energy scientists. The CEA chief, Francis Perrin, decided to postpone the dump. Cousteau organized a publicity campaign which in less than two weeks gained wide popular support. The train carrying the waste was stopped by women and children sitting on the railway tracks, and it was sent back to its origin.\n\nIn the 1960s Cousteau was involved with a set of three projects to build underwater \"villages\"; the projects were named Precontinent I, Precontinent II and Precontinent III. Each ensuing project was aimed at increasing the depth at which people continuously lived under water, and were an attempt at creating an environment in which men could live and work on the sea floor. The projects are best known as Conshelf I (1962), Conshelf II (1963), and Conshelf III (1965). The names \"Precontinent\", and \"Continental Shelf Station\" (Conshelf) were used interchangeably by Cousteau.\nA meeting with American television companies (ABC, M\u00e9trom\u00e9dia, NBC) created the series The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau, with the character of the commander in the red bonnet inherited from standard diving dress intended to give the films a \"personalized adventure\" style. This documentary television series ran for ten years from 1966 to 1976. A second documentary series, The Cousteau Odyssey, ran from 1977 to 1982 on public television stations.\nIn 1970, he wrote the book The Shark: Splendid Savage of the Sea with his son Philippe. In this book, Cousteau described the oceanic whitetip shark as \"the most dangerous of all sharks\".\nIn December 1972, two years after the volcano's last eruption, The Cousteau Society was filming Voyage au bout du monde on Deception Island, Antarctica, when Michel Laval, Calypso's second in command, was struck and killed by a rotor of the helicopter that was ferrying between Calypso and the island.In 1973, along with his two sons and Frederick Hyman, he created the Cousteau Society for the Protection of Ocean Life, Frederick Hyman being its first President.\nIn 1975, John Denver released the tribute song \"Calypso\" on his album Windsong, and on the B-side of his hit song \"I'm Sorry\". \"Calypso\" became a hit on its own and was later considered the new A-side, reaching #2 on the charts.\nIn 1976, Cousteau located the wreck of HMHS Britannic. He also found the wreck of the French 17th-century ship-of-the-line La Therese in coastal waters of Crete.\nIn 1977, together with Peter Scott, he received the UN International Environment prize.\nOn 28 June 1979, while the Calypso was on an expedition to Portugal, his second son Philippe, his preferred and designated successor and with whom he had co-produced all his films since 1969, died in a PBY Catalina flying boat crash in the Tagus river near Lisbon. Cousteau was deeply affected. He called his then eldest son, the architect Jean-Michel, to his side. This collaboration lasted 14 years.\n\n\n=== 1980\u20131990s ===\nFrom 1980 to 1981, he was a regular on the animal reality show Those Amazing Animals, along with Burgess Meredith, Priscilla Presley, and Jim Stafford.\n\nIn 1980, Cousteau traveled to Canada to make two films on the Saint Lawrence River and the Great Lakes, Cries from the Deep and St. Lawrence: Stairway to the Sea.In 1985, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Ronald Reagan.\nFrom 1986 to 1992, Cousteau released Rediscovery of the World.\nOn 24 November 1988, he was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, chair 17, succeeding Jean Delay. His official reception under the cupola took place on 22 June 1989, the response to his speech of reception being given by Bertrand Poirot-Delpech. After his death, he was replaced by \u00c9rik Orsenna on 28 May 1998.\nIn June 1990, the composer Jean Michel Jarre paid homage to the commander by entitling his new album Waiting for Cousteau. He also composed the music for Cousteau's documentary \"Palawan, the last refuge\".\nOn 2 December 1990, his wife Simone Cousteau died of cancer.\nIn June 1991, in Paris, Jacques-Yves Cousteau remarried, to Francine Triplet, with whom he had (before this marriage) two children, Diane and Pierre-Yves. Francine Cousteau currently continues her husband's work as the head of the Cousteau Foundation and Cousteau Society. From that point, the relations between Jacques-Yves and his elder son worsened.\nIn November 1991, Cousteau gave an interview to the UNESCO Courier, in which he stated that he was in favour of human population control and population decrease. Widely quoted on the Internet are these two paragraphs from the interview: \"What should we do to eliminate suffering and disease? It's a wonderful idea but perhaps not altogether a beneficial one in the long run. If we try to implement it we may jeopardize the future of our species...It's terrible to have to say this. World population must be stabilized and to do that we must eliminate 350,000 people per day. This is so horrible to contemplate that we shouldn't even say it. But the general situation in which we are involved is lamentable\".In 1992, he was invited to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for the United Nations' International Conference on Environment and Development, and then he became a regular consultant for the UN and the World Bank.\nIn 1995, he sued his son, who was advertising \"Cousteau Fiji Islands Resort\", to prevent him from using the Cousteau name for business purposes in the United States.On 11 January 1996, Calypso was accidentally rammed and sunk in the port of Singapore by a barge. The Calypso was refloated and towed home to France.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nJacques-Yves Cousteau died of a heart attack on 25 June 1997 in Paris, two weeks after his 87th birthday. He was buried in the family vault at Saint-Andr\u00e9-de-Cubzac, his birthplace. An homage was paid to him by the town by naming the street which runs out to the house of his birth \"rue du Commandant Cousteau\", where a commemorative plaque was placed.\n\n\n=== Honors ===\nDuring his lifetime, Jacques-Yves Cousteau received these distinctions:\n\nCross of War 1939\u20131945 (1945)\nNational Geographic Society's Special Gold Medal in 1961\nCommander of the Legion of Honour (1972)\nOfficer of the Order of Maritime Merit (1980)\nGrand Cross of the National Order of Merit (1985)\nU.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom (1985)\nInduction into the Television Hall of Fame (1987)\nCommander of the Order of Arts and Letters\nHonorary Companion of the Order of Australia (26 January 1990)\n\n\n=== Legacy ===\n\nCousteau's legacy includes more than 120 television documentaries, more than 50 books, and an environmental protection foundation with 300,000 members.Cousteau liked to call himself an \"oceanographic technician.\" He was, in reality, a sophisticated showman, teacher, and lover of nature. His work permitted many people to explore the resources of the oceans.\nHis work also created a new kind of scientific communication, criticized at the time by some academics. The so-called \"divulgationism\", a simple way of sharing scientific concepts, was soon employed in other disciplines and became one of the most important characteristics of modern television broadcasting.\nThe Cousteau Society and its French counterpart, l'\u00c9quipe Cousteau, both of which Jacques-Yves Cousteau founded, are still active today. The Society is currently attempting to turn the original Calypso into a museum and it is raising funds to build a successor vessel, the Calypso II.\nIn his last years, after marrying again, Cousteau became involved in a legal battle with his son Jean-Michel over Jean-Michel licensing the Cousteau name for a South Pacific resort, resulting in Jean-Michel Cousteau being ordered by the court not to encourage confusion between his for-profit business and his father's non-profit endeavours.\nIn 2007, the International Watch Company introduced the IWC Aquatimer Chronograph \"Cousteau Divers\" Special Edition. The timepiece incorporated a sliver of wood from the interior of Cousteau's Calypso research vessel. Having developed the diver's watch, IWC offered support to The Cousteau Society. The proceeds from the timepieces' sales were partially donated to the non-profit organization involved in conservation of marine life and preservation of tropical coral reefs.The 1957 science-fiction book The Deep Range mentions a large research expedition submarine named Cousteau.\n\n\n=== Religious views ===\nThough he was not particularly a religious man, Cousteau believed that the teachings of the different major religions provide valuable ideals and thoughts to protect the environment. In a Chapter entitled \"The Holy Scriptures and The Environment\" in the posthumous work The Human, the Orchid, and the Octopus, he is quoted as stating that \"The glory of nature provides evidence that God exists\".\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Legend ===\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nThe Silent World (1953, with Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dumas)\nCaptain Cousteaus Underwater Treasury (1959, with James Dugan)\nThe Living Sea (1963, with James Dugan)\nWorld Without Sun (1965)\nThe Undersea Discoveries of Jacques-Yves Cousteau (1970\u20131975, 8-volumes, with Philippe Diol\u00e9)\nThe Shark: Splendid Savage of the Sea (1970)\nDiving for Sunken Treasure (1971)\nLife and Death in a Coral Sea (1971)\nThe Whale: Mighty Monarch of the Sea (1972)\nOctopus and Squid: The Soft Intelligence (1973)\nThree Adventures: Gal\u00e1pagos, Titicaca, the Blue Holes (1973)\nDiving Companions: Sea Lion, Elephant Seal, Walrus (1974)\nDolphins (1975)\nThe Ocean World of Jacques Cousteau (1973\u201378, 21 volumes)\nOasis in Space (vol 1)\nThe Act of Life (vol 2)\nQuest for Food (vol 3)\nWindow in the Sea (vol 4)\nThe Art of Motion (vol 5)\nAttack and Defense (vol 6)\nInvisible Messages (vol 7)\nInstinct and Intelligence (vol 8)\nPharaohs of the Sea (vol 9)\nMammals in the Sea (vol 10)\nProvinces of the Sea (vol 11)\nMan Re-Enters Sea (vol 12)\nA Sea of Legends (vol 13)\nAdventure of Life (vol 14)\nOuter and Inner Space (vol 15)\nThe Whitecaps (vol 16)\nRiches of the Sea (vol 17)\nChallenges of the Sea (vol 18)\nThe Sea in Danger (vol 19)\nGuide to the Sea and Index (vol 20)\nCalypso (1978, vol 21)\nA Bill of Rights for Future Generations (1979)\nLife at the Bottom of the World (1980)\nThe Cousteau United States Almanac of the Environment (1981, a.k.a.

It was established on 20 July 1877 and opened to the public on 20 May 1878. The old Raadsaal building was made available by the then Free State Volksraad for hosting the Museum collections. A new museum building was completed in 1913 and the official opening took place in 1915. Since 1881 the museum  has been subsidised mainly by government. Through donations, purchases and exchange agreements the Museum\u2019s collections slowly got established and grew to a wide variety of natural and human science artefacts.\nThe first honorary curator was Dr Hugh Exton. The first director, Dr E.C.N. van Hoepen, was appointed in January 1922. Staff numbers increased from six permanent members in 1951 to 130 members in 1985.\nSince its founding the Museum has developed into an institution of international stature, focusing on natural history, cultural history and art. Intensive research is carried out in these varied disciplines, and valuable and important collections have been established. Through its displays and education programmes, the Museum renders a public service to its diverse audiences, engaging them in enjoyable and enlightening experiences and enriching the learning opportunities of all individuals.\nThe Museum currently includes 13 research departments (both Natural Sciences and Human Sciences), an Art Museum, Education Department, Information Services section / Library, an Administration section, and two technical departments..\nSatellites to the National Museum are Oliewenhuis Art Museum, Freshford House Museum, The First Raadsaal and Wagon Museum, as well as Florisbad Quaternary Research Station.\nOn 19 July 1985 Oliewenhuis was handed over to the National Museum to be developed into an art museum.  Oliewenhuis was erected in 1941 as residence of the Governor-General of the Union of South Africa. Oliewenhuis Art Museum collects exclusively South African art and its collection consists of paintings, sculpture and graphic art.  The pride of the collection is the Pierneef paintings, and the paintings of Bloemfontein done by Thomas Baines in 1851.\nFlorisbad is an internationally important fossil locality which has produced an archaic modern human skull in addition to valuable archaeological and palaeontological material.  In 1912 an earthquake opened up a new spring at the Florisbad mineral spring, and fossil bones and stone artefacts were brought to the surface with the water.  In 1932 the well known Florisbad human cranium was discovered.  In 1980 Florisbad was bought by the South African Government for research purposes and was placed under the administration of the National Museum, Bloemfontein.\nFreshford is one of the few houses of the Edwardian period that still exists in Bloemfontein.  The house was designed and built by the architect, John Edwin Harrison. Freshford House was completed in 1897. The house was acquired by the National Museum in 1982, restored to its former glory and was opened in 1986.\nThe First Raadsaal was built by Maj. H.D. Warden, as a typical South African pioneer's building in 1849.  It was the first school building north of the Orange River. It served as a church until 1852 and it was used by the Legislative Council of the Orange River Sovereignty and the Orange Free State Republic as Assembly Hall and offices.  When the Assembly moved to larger premises the building reverted to its use as a school, which it remained until 1877.  In that year it housed the newly established National Museum. In 1975 the old Raadsaal was once again vacated and transferred to the National Museum.\nThe Wagon Museum is situated on the same premises as the First Raadsaal Museum.  It houses a collection of historical wagons and carriages.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website",

      "name": "Boyden Observatory",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Boyden Observatory is an astronomical research observatory and science education centre located in Maselspoort, 20 kilometres (12 mi) north-east of the city of Bloemfontein in Free State, South Africa. The observatory is managed by the Physics Department of the University of the Free State (UFS). The Friends of Boyden assist the observatory as a public support group, organising open evenings and protecting its public interest. Boyden also makes use of members of ASSA Bloemfontein Centre, the amateur astronomy club of the city, for presenters and telescope assistants.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Boyden Station of Harvard Observatory was founded in 1889 by Harvard University at Mount Harvard near Lima, Peru. It was relocated to Arequipa, Peru in October 1890 (obs.\n code: 800). It was named after Uriah A. Boyden, who in 1879 left in his will $238,000 to Harvard Observatory to be used for astronomical purposes. Significant work done at Arequipa include the discovery of Phoebe, an outer moon of Saturn, by William Henry Pickering using photographic plates captured with the 24 in (61 cm) Bruce Astrograph.In 1927, the observatory was moved to its present location in South Africa. This was done because it was expected that Bloemfontein would be less cloudy than Arequipa, which after two years of recording proved to be true. The site near the settlement of Mazelspoort was formally dedicated in 1933. Its first and longtime director in South Africa was John S. Paraskevopoulos, who held the post from 1927 to 1951. Financial issues at Harvard almost led to the closure of Boyden in 1954, but several European countries became partners in funding and using the observatory. In 1975 Harvard, which had transferred the title to the Smithsonian Institution, announced it would withdraw its support in the following year. UFS agreed to support the facility, and it was donated to UFS in 1976.\n\n\n== Telescopes ==\nThe Boyden-UFS Telescope, which is also known as the Rockefeller Reflector, is a 60 in (150 cm) Cassegrain reflector.\nThe Watcher Robotic Telescope is a 40 cm (16 in) f/14.25 robotic telescope developed by the University College Dublin and UFS. The primary function of the telescope is visual spectrum observation following Gamma-ray bursts.\nThe Nishimura Telescope is a 16 in (41 cm) reflector commissioned by the Nagoya University and constructed by Nishimura Co. Ltd. in 2000. It was not in use as of 2009.\nThe Alvan Clark Telescope is a 13 in (33 cm) refractor named after its maker, Alvan Clark. The telescope was first installed at Mount Wilson Observatory in 1889. It is used for outreach purposes.\nThe 10 in (25 cm) Metcalf Photographic Triplet Refractor is a display item.\nA 20 cm (7.9 in) coelostat (solar telescope) is used for outreach purposes.\n\n\n=== Boyden-UFS Telescope history ===\nAndrew Ainslie Common figured a mirror in 1885 (and another in 1890) for a 60 in (150 cm) Newtonian reflecting telescope (later converted to a Cassegrain), but the telescope fell into disuse and was bought by the Harvard College Observatory from Common's estate. The primary mirror was re-figured in 1933, and along with a new mount it was installed at Boyden.In the mid-1960s the Hamburg engineering firm of Heidenreich and Harbeck was contracted to build a new mirror cell for the telescope to reduce the problems experienced due to the thinness of the mirror and the fact its back surface was not flat. Shortly afterward the old Common primary mirror was replaced by a new 60 in (150 cm) mirror from Loomis made of low-expansion glass.In 2001 the telescope received a major upgrade by DFM Engineering. This upgrade included a new control system, modifications to the mirror cell, and a new primary light shield. From 2005 to 2009 it was part of the Probing Lensing Anomalies Network.\n\n\n=== Former telescopes ===\nThe 0.9 m (35 in) Armagh-Dunsink-Harvard Telescope was a Schmidt\u2013Cassegrain telescope built in 1949 by Perkin-Elmer. Three organisations were involved: Armagh Observatory, Dunsink Observatory, and Harvard. It was installed at Bloemfontein in 1950. However, it never worked well, and after several attempts to fix it, the mirrors and lens were removed in 1981 and sent to Dunsink.\nThe 0.6 m (24 in) Bruce Astrograph was a refracting telescope built in 1893 by Alvan Clark & Sons. After being used for many years in Arequipa, it was brought to Bloemfontein and housed in a building with a roll-off roof. With plates taken by this telescope, Harlow Shapley discovered the Sculptor and Fornax dwarf galaxies, the first of their kind. In 1950, it was replaced by the Armagh-Dunsink-Harvard Telescope.\n\n\n== Research and discoveries ==\nBoyden Observatory performs professional astrophysics research using the 1.5 meter reflector. In addition to the research program, the observatory runs an active educational program for school children from all backgrounds as well as for members of the public, attracting thousands of visitors each year. In 1966, this observatory discovered four asteroids.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nFacilities include the main building where the original offices were and where the library is, the resident astronomer's house, a state-of-the-art auditorium seating 100 people inside and 200 people on its roof for open-air sky shows, the main telescope buildings, smaller telescope buildings, a lecture room, store room, the ASSA Bloemfontein clubhouse, observation platforms, and various vantage points.\n\n\n=== Proposed Extensions ===\nThe observatory is constantly experiencing growth in visitor numbers and the extension of its facilities. Medium term plans call for e.g. the establishment of an educational walking route for visitors to appreciate the diverse natural life in the area, a museum and science exhibition areas, upgrading of the educational telescope facilities etc. Long term plans include the construction of a digital planetarium and the completion of the fully-fledged Science Hall. A digital planetarium is open in the nearby city of Bloemfontein on Naval Hill (South Africa's first digital planetarium), inside the original dome of the Lamont-Hussey observatory.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAstronomical Society of Southern Africa\nList of astronomical observatories\nSouth African Astronomical Observatory\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFriends of Boyden\nUniversity of the Free State\nWatcher telescope homepage",

        "wiki": "The National Museum in Bloemfontein dates back to the 1870s, when its collections and displays comprised mainly rarities from around the world. It was established on 20 July 1877 and opened to the public on 20 May 1878. The old Raadsaal building was made available by the then Free State Volksraad for hosting the Museum collections. A new museum building was completed in 1913 and the official opening took place in 1915. Since 1881 the museum  has been subsidised mainly by government. Through donations, purchases and exchange agreements the Museum\u2019s collections slowly got established and grew to a wide variety of natural and human science artefacts.\nThe first honorary curator was Dr Hugh Exton. The first director, Dr E.C.N. van Hoepen, was appointed in January 1922. Staff numbers increased from six permanent members in 1951 to 130 members in 1985.\nSince its founding the Museum has developed into an institution of international stature, focusing on natural history, cultural history and art. Intensive research is carried out in these varied disciplines, and valuable and important collections have been established. Through its displays and education programmes, the Museum renders a public service to its diverse audiences, engaging them in enjoyable and enlightening experiences and enriching the learning opportunities of all individuals.\nThe Museum currently includes 13 research departments (both Natural Sciences and Human Sciences), an Art Museum, Education Department, Information Services section / Library, an Administration section, and two technical departments..\nSatellites to the National Museum are Oliewenhuis Art Museum, Freshford House Museum, The First Raadsaal and Wagon Museum, as well as Florisbad Quaternary Research Station.\nOn 19 July 1985 Oliewenhuis was handed over to the National Museum to be developed into an art museum.  Oliewenhuis was erected in 1941 as residence of the Governor-General of the Union of South Africa. Oliewenhuis Art Museum collects exclusively South African art and its collection consists of paintings, sculpture and graphic art.  The pride of the collection is the Pierneef paintings, and the paintings of Bloemfontein done by Thomas Baines in 1851.\nFlorisbad is an internationally important fossil locality which has produced an archaic modern human skull in addition to valuable archaeological and palaeontological material.  In 1912 an earthquake opened up a new spring at the Florisbad mineral spring, and fossil bones and stone artefacts were brought to the surface with the water.  In 1932 the well known Florisbad human cranium was discovered.  In 1980 Florisbad was bought by the South African Government for research purposes and was placed under the administration of the National Museum, Bloemfontein.\nFreshford is one of the few houses of the Edwardian period that still exists in Bloemfontein.  The house was designed and built by the architect, John Edwin Harrison. Freshford House was completed in 1897. The house was acquired by the National Museum in 1982, restored to its former glory and was opened in 1986.\nThe First Raadsaal was built by Maj. H.D. Warden, as a typical South African pioneer's building in 1849.  It was the first school building north of the Orange River. It served as a church until 1852 and it was used by the Legislative Council of the Orange River Sovereignty and the Orange Free State Republic as Assembly Hall and offices.  When the Assembly moved to larger premises the building reverted to its use as a school, which it remained until 1877.  In that year it housed the newly established National Museum. In 1975 the old Raadsaal was once again vacated and transferred to the National Museum.\nThe Wagon Museum is situated on the same premises as the First Raadsaal Museum.  It houses a collection of historical wagons and carriages.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website",

          "You can not come England and not go to Thorpe Park. It Is an amazing and huge fun park where you can try everything from rollercoaster to all kinds of funny and weird machines. Food, sweets, drinks and so much more in that park that you will never want to leave it. Highly",
          "Going into the park you have to queue up for a while as I knew because of security checks but come on Thorpe Park I know you are near a big city called London but a lot of European parks don't do these security checks you do. As for the rides, some need to be changed, Colossus",
          "I visited the park in October of last year and had a great time! We visited on a Friday to avoid busy queuing times and that was definitely a good choice. I have read other reviews saying that queue times were ridiculous so I would strongly advise you visit on a weekday. We were",
          "Took the kids here in fright nights 2019 and had a fab time on all the rides with lovely staff around park to help with directions and questions! Apart from the horrific food in Finns bar and grill which left my 15 year old son and 13 year old daughter starving for the day....",
          "I have never been to such a nice theme park. You can enjoy lots of rides, taste good food , swim in the sea and buy souvenirs in the nice shop inside the park. Unique experience, especially if you travel with students, and bear in mind that a whole day might not be enough!",
          "I'll begin by commending all of the decent rollercoasters here - I'm forever an avid fan of them all. Like many other comments left here, I absolutely echo the sentiments with regards to the queues being far too long. And I hear that Thorpe Parks Fastrack Season Pass isn't",
          "The park itself is absolutely amazing. Good queues and theming and atmosphere. I managed to do all of the feared 5 with short and convenient queue times. Swarm was by far the best themed ride in the uk. The long queues are so worth it as it packs g force and inversions. They are",
          "Had an absolute blast at Thorpe Park, we returned from our 3 week Maldive vacation and booked an additional 2 day break here as a surprise for our 2 teenage daughters. We were a little apprehensive at first as our body clocks were ut and we had traveled for 16 hours to get back",
          "We visit here a few times a year as we have Merlin passes. We have a 13yr old and 5yr old and 2yr old. I would say that thorpe isn't ideal for younger children. It's more for the teens or adults. We never spend a full day there and usually only go for an hour or so on the way",
          "I\u2019ve been to Thorpe park several times and I\u2019ve never had a good experience! The 1st time I went they had an entire park power cut and had to leave after 2 hours and this time was even worse than that! We arrived early to get tickets to get into the park on time. Unfortunately",
          "First time I\u2019ve been to fright night and I\u2019ve wanted to go for about 3 years now, went with my 2 friends and my boyfriend and it was absolutely brilliant. We went on swarm and the que was about 2 hours long which tbh was expected but the ride was so much fun. We then enjoyed",
          "The Fright Nights are brilliant fun The experiences walking dead etc are fabulous, rides as you'd expect- thrilling and fun. Had a really good couple of exhausting days during October, was really busy. Is worth getting a fasttrack pass if you really want to get on a ride and",
          "Was \u00a340 for a ticket I believe when I visited but ended up spending about \u00a3350 between 2 of us in the end, as when we entered the park it was ram packed and had to buy unlimited fast track to be able to enjoy the day, with food, drinks and gifts thrown in it came to more than",
          "So I took my neice as a gift and test before we went to Alton. The rides are mainly the high speed and super exciting ones which she was reluctant to go on. She also acted too grown up telling me she wasn't old enough for the demon ride - sigh - yep some age restricted rides.",
          "It was awesome! If you like thrills, fear and fast food, then this is the perfect place for you! From small kiddie rides like Enterprise to Stealth, the Speed Demon, Thorpe Park has an amazing variety of rollercoasters. There are spinning teapots that are good for young",
          "Like I've said it's a ok day but the price to get in plus the average food u can purchase there isn't great all cooked by teenagers who have no clue it's had some upgrades but not overall it's still the same after so many years the fast pass is a con do not waste your money your",
          "Overall my travel was good and I read that over 1 million of Thorpe parks customers use the train to travel.",
          "The park itself is great, we've gone two years in a row it's just a shame about the queues on weekends but Monday we got on over double the amount of rides in 4 hours than we did the whole day Sunday. The restaurant on site was as you'd expect price wise and food not that great,",
          "Spent around \u00a3200 on entrance a fast track for the mazes plus also a adrenaline package for two as it was for Halloween. Firstly the mazes were absolutely terrible. We usually go to Tully\u2019s and love it there but thought we needed a change. They had no actors really in any of",
          "Went for 2019 services day. Enjoyed all the rides but it poured all day and we were drenched through and freezing so had to leave after only a few hours. Still wouldn\u2019t put us off trying again as had some great times here. It\u2019s just a pity the weather can\u2019t be fixed!!",
          "We went as a family of four including two teenagers to the Fright Night. Had a great time and begrudgingly bought four fast passes. But best decision, despite the cost, as some of the the normal queues were 90mins+. So it was great just to cruise to more or less the front of the",
          "Visited for a Fright Night. Had an amazing time. The rides are great and food was good-pizza buffet! Yum. Went in the mazes and it was great fun.",
          "When we first arrived which was just after the opening time of 10am the rides were already at around 30/45 minute waits but after first ride each fright night ride that was open in the day was at 110 minute waiting times and the remaining rides were also about 90 minute waiting.",
          "This review is specifically concerning my most recent visit on Blue light card day. Firstly, thank you Thorpe park for putting on this event to allow people to come and experience the park at a discount and with a capped amount of people. My family love coming to the park for",
          "Amazing Thorpe staff are great and so are operations also the parks history is interesting also the park is well presented and in amity you feel abroad",
          "Absolutely amazing day but queues for some of the rides were horrendous. We queued for 1 and a half hours for nemesis inferno even though it was advertised for half an hour, and then just as we were about to go on it broke down and then we had to wait for an extra half an hour",
          "We visited on Saturday 2nd November, a family of 5 which cost \u00a3172.. oh i wish I had saved my money to be honest. It was a miserable day to start off with, rain and windy, most big rides were closed til midday but when they did open, the queues exceeded 100 minutes plus or the",
          "Would never do a fright night date again. Queues were the longest I\u2019ve ever experienced in any theme park. We were there for almost 10 hours and did 3 coasters and 2 scare mazes. Decided our last ride would be Derren Brown\u2019s Ghost Train which had a 75 minute queue time.",
          "We go to Thorpe Park Fright Nights annually and it's always a great event. Warning for people who choose to go in october half term as its absolutely packed most of the week. We've noticed that the park like to overestimate queue times significantly, so don't rely on the",
          "I recently took a group of students to the Park as a trip. We had our bags searched & Halloween masks were confiscated because they're intimidating (it was Halloween night & they werent scary masks), & a non plastic bottle. When we went to retrieve, the staff had either stolen",
          "Had a great evening out on 21.10.19 with my nieces. Did not need to fastrack any of the rides and was able to go on the rides multiple times. If you are in to thrilling rides and will go at least 2-3 times minimum for the year it is worthwhile investing in an annual/season pass.",
          "Queues were estimated 1.5/2 hours but once in them took almost 3 hours! You pay alot of money to go to this park and you only manage to get on a few rides ALL day! I have visited so many times before ( Around 20/30 times ) but can honestly say this was one of the worst visits i",
          "Have taken our 2 eldest in summer but also went with our friends. Best ride for me was swarm, think we went on 3 in a row. Made use of the app to make sure we avoided long queues and got most out of the day. Did saw first as i hate vertical drops but was quite fun in the end.",
          "Absolutely awful, party of ten, ride wait was nearly three times longer than estimated,cracked a rib on railings in one of the walkthrough rides, paramedics useles, rides kept breaking down after waiting 1hr 40mins for a supposedly 30 min wait with two autistic kids in tow was",
          "Thorpe Park is indeed an Island like no other! Nowhere else would you pay to stand around for hours going nowhere and getting nothing. I am an old hand at writing reviews about Merlins theme parks! The rides are a joke, there is never a time when all rides operate! It is",
          "After paying \u00a3100 for a day pass for myself and 2 children aged 12 and 10 , we had been at the park for 2 and a half hours and had only managed to get on 2 rides!! We arrived at 11am. We had to pay another \u00a328 each for fast track for 3 of the fright night mazes because the",
          "I've visited Thorpe Park nearly 20 times over 12 years or so. The most recent visit was good, however I was disappointed by the inaccurate ride queuing times on the app and the start of the queue. Technology should be able to cope with this and it doesnt work. Parking is costly",
          "This was my second visit to Thorpe Park and one I wish I hadn't made. The park was over crowded, the rides had waiting times of 1.5-2 hours but in reality you would queue for 3 hours. The scare mazes also had similar waiting times. While in the queue for Nemesis Inferno the ride",
          "What an absolute joke of a theme park this is so not go here if you want to enjoy a good ride or good day out Alton towers or any other theme park would be better that\u2019s for sure this place is an absolute joke of a theme park over priced and under staffed an utter rip you pay",
          "We had to wait ages for rides we then went to fast track where we told them what rides we wanted fast track for and the person helping us told us the wrong one which meant we had wasted money on fast track tickets not to be used.",
          "Awesome amusement park shame I went in summer holidays as queuing is just madness. Rides quality! Staff friendly.....good day out!",
          "The rides were amaaaazing and I threw up on one but I don\u2019t really care because they were as awesome as anything I have ever been on. However the food wasn\u2019t excellent as there were quite a few queues, but didn\u2019t feel long as we were so hyped. Onto the toilettes. Not bad...",
          "My partner and I went for the Fright Night Experience, paid extra for fast track adrenaline else we wouldn\u2019t have managed to do many rides or mazes... hidden queues behind fences and 2 hour plus waits, we did 2 plus the 5 fast track rides with the extra \u00a345 each tickets we",
          "It was my sons 30 th birthday and he loves theme parks the bigger the ride the better it is . We went on the 1st November the park was set for fright night , it was quite busy only managed to do one maize as the wait times were long , the atmosphere was very good all the staff",
          "Fast rides nice atmosphere snacks also good and prise was quiet good. What I didn't like was the fast track. U pay extra money to get in the 1st and other who had normal ticket have to wait 30 or 40 minutes. I find it quiet unfair because there could be another solution for",
          "Rides were good when you eventually got to go on them. Queue times too long. We arrived 10.30am and left 4.30pm as didn\u2019t want to stand about in another queue for an hour getting chilled. I have been to several theme parks including Disneyland and Alton Towers and never had to",
          "I've visited Thorpe park a few times now since having a Merlin Pass. My first visit last year I was blown away by what rides the have to offer, some of the best coasters in UK/ Europe in my opinion. However, after our recent visit this weekend for the last couple of days of the",
          "We went with out nine nearly ten year old. Atleast three of the rides were closed and some not opening until later in the day due to \u2018fright night\u2019 which meant that the others had silly waiting times not good with a nine year old in the freezing cold also narrowed what we could",
          "We were a party of nine - my husband and his friend has made his complaint known - there was a massive fight in the queue and no real security. No checking of people coming in - shocking.",
          "What a disappointment! I absolutely love horror mazes, have been to many including Alton Towers (which I would 100% recommend) Thorpe Park just don't seem to have got it right. Rides - great that the rides are open 10am to 10pm at the weekend, but with the sheer amount of",
          "Amazing experience and great rides, even though it was busy we managed to get on all the rides. The food area can be better but the place is amazing",
          "Rides are good, but everything else was pretty appalling. Terribly short staffed, and the staff that were working obviously couldn\u2019t give a s***. I understand they\u2019re probably knackered and underpaid but when queue jumping actually causes a huge fight and you stand there",
          "Came to fright night far to many season passes now issued queues for mazes very long being a week day and schools not broken up yet why not have bookable times for mazes like Alton towers but don't get greedy with the prices to book I think merlin should think about this passed",
          "I am a very loyal person. I loved Thorpe park and have been many times, and really wanted to enjoy it at my first scarefest this halloween. Bitterly disappointing to say the least. I had read and ignored other travellers comments about long queues and the parks greed and",

What was the point in us even going! The rides are good fun, but felt disappointed to",
          "Went on a fright night day/evening. Was ridiculous, only managed to get on 2 rides and one maze as the queues were 120 minuets each. Can\u2019t believe the tickets were so expensive when you can\u2019t even go on anything. Disgusted to be honest. Awful day/evening",
          "I went to Thorpe Park for Fright Night this year with 3 friends, we were all very excited and got there around 12 and decided to do all of our favourites rides first. Managed to do around 5 rides before we decided to queue for the mazes when they opened. Whilst queuing for",

          "I used to love Thorpe park but it\u2019s a joke now. Under staffed, over crowded. My kids did an 11 hr day for fright night and managed 1 ride and 2 mazes. Terrible value for money, \u00a3204 for 4 with parking. Fast passes not worth it as the queues were also huge which defeats the point.",

          "I visited for fright night and it was just boring. There was no atmosphere, lights, characters, or decorations and the queues were very long. I also don't like that majority of the rides are extreme thrill seeker rides as my boyfriend and I wanted something moderate. Lots of",
          "A great day out. Never visited Thorpe Park before and were quite impressed. Not all perfect- the place in general could do with a bit of a general facelift but the rides were great. Our 12 year old son loved it- lots of adrenaline surged through the system all helped by the fast",

          "Good value for money - got the season passes after buying full price tickets over summer and only had to pay \u00a315 for each fright nights ticket with them. The rides are all really enjoyable and there\u2019s something for everyone. However our day was really spoiled. Had groups of",
          "So underwhelming. First time coming here for Halloween. Previous years have been going to alton towers and thought we would try something new. The advertising was great and I really thought maybe give it a go, something different. Was I wrong. Thorpe Park need to invest in there",
          "The rides were what i expected BUT i went for the haunted house experience. I normally go to Universal Studios for fright night and this experience did not compare. the price was good for the park, worth the money but the fast track was overpriced for the trill of the events.",
          "Im so disgusted and disturbed by the inappropriate extreme lengths people have to go through before entering the theme park. We had all already came through the theme park however decided to go to the shop outside as we did not want to pay their extreme prices. On are way back",

          "A great place to go with your kids if you want to see fights between rival gangs as we did. Four on to one, no Queensbury rules anymore. Insufficient security with a laughable bag search as you enter. Don't get me wrong, they do what they can personally, but they are in low",
          "Ride times ridiculous, that\u2019s if the rides were actually working, which most weren\u2019t! Maze times 120mins wait! 2 rides and 1 maze in 9 hours. Clearly not enough staff in the food areas as queues for food were terrible too. Never again...money grabbing Thorpe Park you should be",
          "This is a very quick review as I felt I wasted too much time at fright night of the 30th. I agree with previous reviews about feeling in safe. I too was in KFC when a fight broke out and spilled out to other tables. With all the money this company makes why is there no security",

You\u2019d never know by walking around the park! A few blood covered bags hanging from trees and that\u2019s pretty much it.",
          "Really disappointing from the start. Bag searches took 20 minutes and with no controls in place,parents just walking to the front of the queue. We visited on 30th October. Lots of rides closed and 90 to 120 minutes queues. One ride broke down with customers stuck on a coaster",

          "I loved the atmosphere in the Park. They had clearly made a real effort with this and there were some really nice pretty lights which had been put up. It felt really warm and cosy. I would also like to say that the disabled access to all the attractions is fantastic. As someone",

          "This was our second year of fright nights and this year was disappointing. There were very few actors roaming the parks in the evening scaring people which was a shame. The biggest let down was that you simply let too many people into the park and the queues were ridiculous. 2",
          "Well I am so dissatisfied with this. You wait over 90 mins for a maze to walk in a muddy little wood. Another is less than 5 mins and was more like a fun house. The amount of time you cue ths disappointed is overwhelming. Even the actors are finding it hard to scare. I think if",

          "Queue times were ok this year weren\u2019t just queuing all day. Love the mazes but just wish they lasted a bit longer. Each maze probably takes 1-2 minutes to complete and I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s long enough. Probably still go back next year though....",

          "Had been looking forward to this trip for weeks, particularly going on the rides at night and experiencing some of the mazes. We arrived about 12.30.....we went straight onto The Walking Dead ride which was mediocre...the sets are amazing and whoever designs them ....well done.",
          "We went to fright night for the first time, elements of it where really fun, but the queues where really ridiculous and not manageable unless you have fast pass or sacrifice some rides. Also have to say I hated the amount of smoking around the entire park, I think they need more",
          "Went with my teenage son and daughter . We had a fab day . All rides all par two were open . This is definitely for those thrill seekers . Queuing is about the only downfall, but it\u2019s expected I guess at theme parks , and a few of the photos booths werent working .Loads of",
          "Wow what can I say. The whole day was amazing. The queue times weren\u2019t too bad and the mazes were so good too! My advice is do some of the big rides in the evening as most people would be doing the mazes. The Derren Brown ghost train broke down on us after waiting for an hour",
          "We visited for fright night Got there early to avoid the queues All started well got on a few rides early on the it started to get busy queue times around 60 mins We were queuing for the cinema and there were two large groups of teenages They were having a bit of a row then",
          "What a blast at Thrope Park for the fright night totally convincing actors, can't wait to go again next year but does get very busy on Saturday which the day we went, we got told best to go a week day of course halloween itself will be busy at a guess but anyway go see gut",
          "A good day as always at Thorpe Park however the waiting times were ATROCIOUS. Emboldened by the fact that all those with fast track tickets were unfairly prioritised. Couldn\u2019t even go in the mazes because the daunting prospect of a >2 hour waiting time was too overwhelming.",
          "The day started badly - we'd visited in October half term before and used 2 for 1 vouchers, but there seems to have been a change of policy so we ended up paying the extortionate 'on the door' prices instead of buying online, which we would have done if we'd known. We were a bit",
          "Really enjoyed the visit, scare mazes and riding the roller coasters at night. Platform 15 was the best though. The other Mazes were ok. The queue times were reasonable. Staff were friendly and helpful.",
          "Came to fright night for 2 days, didn't stay in the shark hotel but off park as it is cheaper, we came last year for the first time and I have to say, security was better last year, very suprised at it this time, there is a sign to tell you to have your bags open and ready, i",
          "Having visited with a small group of older friends during October for the scare fest, I have to say I was somewhat disappointed with the scare actors in the Walking Dead maze. One of the actors broke out of character as I screamed back in her face at her attempt to scare me and",
          "It was mine and a friends first time at fright night and wow! We loved it! However, just a couple of criticisms! The mazes although brilliant were very similar. The long tunnel on platform 15 could have been made a bit scarier. The biggest disappointment was the lack of actors",
          "We got to the park and 10:30am, no queues to get in and straight through bag-check. There was only a 5 minute wait for Stealth so we did that first (that certainly woke us up!) we then managed Swarm, Saw, Walking Dead ride and Derren Brown ghost ride before the mazes opened. Got",
          "Rides are amazing white knuckle thrills in the dark! The staff are helpful and friendly. Scare mazes are great and the actors brilliant special shout out to the creek freak crew for the high energy scares. Amity high are fun and spooky they are always happy to take a freaky",
          "We were extremely lucky that the wait times on the first day asds were really good. Most were 5-15 mins with a couple being 35. The actors were really good. Containment was good but definitely not worth the money, was over in 20mins. Theres not enough water fountains to fill up",
          "We booked a short break with the shark hotel and we stayed from Monday - Tuesday. The Monday was fantastic as there was only around 5 - 20 minute wait on the rides for the majority of the day and night. This suprised us as we managed to get on all the rides we wanted and the",
          "We come every year in October for my brothers birthday and every year we have a brilliant time , lots on offer . The only let down is that fright night this year was very disappointing , not as many decorations , not as many actors and the saw maze was not open . Hopefully next",
          "We have an annual pass so go often but you have to go when it is quiet. Food and drink is over priced, \u00a32 for a bottle of water or \u00a310 for one of there refills which costs about 7p per refill!! The que\u2019s can be too long and they shut/open rides to crowd control! And when you\u2019ve",

          "I was expecting fright night to be amazing, really fun really scary but was completely the opposite. The only joy I had for the day was going on the big rides. When it got to the evening we decided to go on the Blair witch maze first, after a 90 minute wait in the queue all the",
          "The rides were good but all the small rides were closed. The staff on rides were great friendly and helpful. Very dissapointed with customer service by some staff at information/ customer service Ash at the disabled access hub was amazing very empathic,helpful and efficient.",
          "My cousin dropped his keys on the swarm ride around 3 o\u2019clock and we saw where they landed, they told us to come back at 10 when the park was shut. We come back at 10 and was told they had to contact the engineer to go and search for the keys. Around 10:45 they told us they",
          "We planned a family visit for Fright Night with older kids on a Saturday....what a mistake at a weekend !! While it's a good park with good facilities and the potential for an awesome Halloween attraction, it's just TOO busy and fast track is the only way. Before you rush out",
          "we visited the park 19.10.19 for fright night, we travelled from oxford and stayed in a nearby hotel so that we could really enjoy our experience of fright night!! Well what a waste of money and time! We arrived at 3pm and was only able to do 2 rides whilst we was there!! The",

          "Living within an hour of Alton Towers, we go there quite a lot so decided to change it up and go to Thorpe Park. it was a 2.5 hr drive, (more like 3 due to traffic) but we decided to drive there and back rather than paying the crazy prices to stay in one of the tiny rooms on the",
          "Fantastic two days at Thorpe Park! Fright Nights really delivered, the 2 hour queues last night for the mazes were a shame but what can you expect for such a popular resort. If you work it right and use the app you can move around the park efficiently and really enjoy a varied",
          "Rides were great as usual but mazes were substandard to the pint that they were funny. He\u2019d a great laugh and got sent out of a maze for shouting you slag at one of the actors. All together a memorable experience and will be attending again.",
          "Had a great day at Thorpe Park. Coasters are great and the pizza buffet restaurant was great. Horror mazes we\u2019re good abs the actors were really good. Only downside is apart from the mazes and a few decorations hanging around there wasn\u2019t a very Halloween atmosphere.",
          "A big thank you to all the actors at amytiville and do or die maze. You had me convinced and proper scary. You were awesome.",
          "We went for a friends birthday and contemplated getting unlimited fast track the day before, as none of us had the patience to wait in line for anything lol. The weather was predicted to be wet so we figured the park would be a bit emptier than usual so best not to buy it. It",
          "Great theme park BUT you have to pay parking charge ,you would think you make enough money on entry tickets ,love too know the reason for this charge?",
          "After the past few years going to Scarefest me and the daughter thought we would try Fright Nights instead. I have got to say that because you don't pay extra for the mazes you get excellent value for money. 5 mazes plus all the rides. There was an escape room for an up charge",
          "The place is very tired and dated. We went on a windy day so unfortunately some of the rides were not working due to the weather, another ride wasn\u2019t working because they were waiting for \u2018the engineer\u2019 ... so the few rides that were left open had very long queues ... in",

          "I spent the day here with my daughter and her boyfriend and a friend and it was brilliant! It is much easier to get around than Alton Towers and booking online got us around \u00a320 off the ticket entry price. I find it a little disappointing, however, that we had to pay a further",
          "Heard so many good things about Thorpe Park and it didn\u2019t disappoint. I thought it would be bigger but it packs lots of fantastic rides into a smallish park which meant we didn\u2019t spend ages walking from ride to ride. We went on a miserable weather Friday in October when rain had",
          "What an amazing experience! We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and please give our thanks and recognition to the guy operating Nemesis. We rode it 3 times during morning, afternoon and evening and all throughout his energy was amazing and he was an absolute credit to Thorpe Park!",
          "A bit of a rainy day but this didn\u2019t hamper the day. If anything I think it out off some park goers. Rides like Swarm, Saw, Stealth, Nemesis Inferno and Colossus are well worth the wait for. Swarm and Saw were the standout rides. I would however avoid the Walking Dead ride, very",
          "This place is incredible! The rides were amazing. We went for Fright Nights and there was a few special events running. My favourite ride was Nemesis Inferno. Tidal Wave was great as well, I went on it six times and I went on the Swarm three times. Definitely recommend.",

          "I visited Thorpe Park yesterday and it saddens me that after every visit you notice a decline in quality amongst many aspects of the park but an increase in prices. I mean \u00a310 to park your car, and then having to queue for half hour to exit it. Gone are the days where each area",
          "Me and 4 friends bought tickets to go to fright night this year, unfortunately one was unable to go due to a serious illness in his family. Despite contacting the park early they refused a refund for his ticket, this is just money grabbing in my opinion - extremely poor customer",
          "Very poor from Merlin. Queued for colossus had to leave as ride broke. Then queued for saw. Waiting time 30 mins after 1 hour told engineering called hour and half later left queue. Poor value for money. If they are charging \u00a350+ per ticket rides should be properly serviced.",
          "Went last night Thursday10th October 2019 to what was supposed to be Fright Night !!! nothing frightening about it it was RUBBISH!!! . NO decorative theme, didnt see anyone walking around scary, music playing over tannoy was old rock n roll 50s 60s music ,what a waste of time",

          "Thorpe park has some of the best rides in the Uk, rides like Stealth (awesome), Nemesis Inferno (brilliant) Colussus (very good) and Saw (great but headache inducing!). Rush near the entrance dome is also really good. What is really disappointing is the state of the park.",

          "Going to the park and going on the rides were amazing It was a thrilling day out but the only thing that could of been better is the rides not shutting down and having technical difficulties or the fact the children were sick. It was a good day! Despite the fact waiting longer",

Some rides like rapids you have to join fast track queue 20-40 min Hello disabled can\u2019t stand still for that long. We accessed 5 rides in total for \u00a350. Be prepared to spend",
          "Spent 80 minutes queueing for Darren brown ghost train, what an absolute joke. Vfx was crap and train was bad, we were led to another area after the train to get scared by non scary loose zombie staff, then led back again to the train to non enjoyable vr. The lady next to me was",

          "We were expecting long queues but not queuing for an hour only for the ride to close due to a \"temporary issue\". This happened twice in one morning on 2 separate rides. We were told we could not wait even though we were so close to the front of the queue. The ride reopened",
          "Went here with my Daughter with tickets got for free through a national newspaper. Selected a Monday out of school holidays on the hope the park would be quiet and it was so we managed to get on everything we wanted to and had very little queuing time. Have been here many",
          "Really liked the fact the site is quite compact as trekking round all day can be exhausting. Generally the park was well kept with plenty of litter pickers, but some attention was needed in the toilets which every time any of us visited had several cubicles with no paper. It",
          "I had an awesome time however the rife I wanted to go on was closed all day due to waiting for an engineer to arrive",

          "I love Thorpe Park, been several times but this visit was a bit of a let down. I really noticed how everything is geared up to rinse more money out of you, the change machine charged me a quid to change a fiver! The food is decent but expensive. But the queues are my real",
          "We all decided to come to Thorpe Park out of season and the longest time we queued for a ride was 30 minutes! (This was actually one of the newer rides: The Ghost Train). We had such a great day on all the rides and I can\u2019t wait to come back. Definitely the best theme park I\u2019ve",
          "We had a great day at the resort. The rides are fabulous, the staff are friendly, there\u2019s a really good choice of food. The approx queue times are spot on & there\u2019s a great choice of rides. However, MAJOR problems in the car park at closing time. It took us 2 hours to get out!!!",
          "Some of the best thrill rides ive EVER been on!....Saw, Stealth, Swarm & Nemisis and Much Much More!!! Just could not get enough of them!... Cant wait to go again!",
          "We went on 10 September, purposely out of season. The longest we queued for rides was 10 minutes. We have managed to get on all the rides we wanted to.",
          "So i just arrived home this evening from a 2 day 1 night stay at Thorpe park... All I can say is wow! Was so worried reading reviews of the hotel... But I really shouldn\u2019t have worried. It\u2019s comfy, cosy and more than enough room. It\u2019s more than a \u2018shipping container\u2019 people",
          "We went to TP on Saturday... Yes, the sun was shining, but it wasn't school holidays - we went on Zodiac (15 mins), Colossus (1.5hrs) and Storm Surge (40 mins) and the children went on the young rides (only 5 mins each). All the flagship rides were far too long to queue and so",
          "Went to TP yesterday. Best thing about the day was the weather. So glad we got 2 free tickets through an offer and only one in our group had to pay the (outrageous) full amount because If we had paid full price for what we got yesterday I think I would have been bursting a blood",
          "Not many food options here, but some of the best rollercoasters in the uk. Parking \u00a310. Reasonable fast pass tickets. Pizza all you can eat pretty good, gets busy from midday. Not great for wheelchairs but nowhere as bad as LEGOLAND.",

          "I am writing this sat in the car park of Thorpe Park where I have been for nearly an hour and have only moved 100 yards. Over an hour to get out of a car park is totally unacceptable I expect a long wait for some rides but I also expect an accurate assessment of the waiting",
          "I was very skeptical about going due to recent terrible reviews, however, I was very pleasantly surprised! ALL the rides were working and there was virtually no wait time for any of them. We even rode Stealth three times back to back!! We went to the all you can eat pizza/pasta",
          "Lots of rides and activities to do and if you get the weather it\u2019s a brilliant day. Hardly any queue time as kids were back at school and was good value money wise",
          "So it was my partners birthday, and we brought 2 friends along is well. It was lovely weather which made the experience great, and the kids were back at school so there was very little queuing time which was amazing. Overall it was a great day out, we travelled from telford to",
          "Went on a Friday of the first week back for most school kids and really didn't have to wait longer than 10/15mins for any ride (other than the Ghost Train which was 45 mins). A 10 min wait for the Stealth meant we went on it three times in a row and towards the end of the day",
          "We came to Thorpe Park for a 2 day break with a days hotel stay in between. We stayed in a local travelodge however in hindsight I would have stayed in the on site hotel, not much difference in price and the benefits (free breakfast, parking and an hours fast pass) outweigh the",
          "Had a great day the park was empty only five minute wait for the rides. Even though I can only go on the rapids as I am disabled and was going to go on the storm surge it was not working. I was looking forward to going on tidal wave and that was broken too. So had a good day",
          "I\u2019ve visited the park on many occasions. This is the first that had no queues! The last times we barely got on any due to 1-3 hour waiting times waiting... but today it wasn\u2019t busy, 5 minute waiting time from 10am-5pm even for Saw, Stealth, Nemises, basically everything! I",
          "We had the best time, all the ride queues were less than 5 minutes and the staff let us ride multiple times. Also shoutout to Nathan on the Swarm who was so friendly all 15 times we rode, he talked to us and made sure our day was going great! Definitely worth it!",
          "Our kids are only 9 & 11 so their were some rides we couldn\u2019t go on. The day seemed to go fast but by 2pm we had only done 2 rides & a kfc \ud83d\ude14 each ride was at least 60-90 minutes long and kfc was absolutely rammed. Disappointed as we went on a Monday (in September) hoping it",
          "This place is really great for adults as they are big rides. But once you get in you have to pay for your food and it\u2019s sooo expensive",
          "Went with two children aged 6 and 8 - and pretty much discovered they couldn't go on the majority of the rides due to height and age restrictions, and the ones they could go on, were, in their words, \"too babyish\". Lots of fairground type stalls to take your money. There were",
          "Two of the Main Rides were not working. One other ride we queued for broke down so they closed that, later on in the day it re-opened so we queued again but then it broke down again! Queue times were not accurate. Considering the cost of entry it was very disappointing for the",
          "Went with my partner and our 7 year old who is 1.3m tall. Sadly not tall enough for all the best fast rides (1.4m) but we knew this before we went. I got 2 free tickets from The Sun paper so didn\u2019t mind paying for just 1 ticket. I wouldn\u2019t have been happy if I\u2019d paid full price",
          "Went to Thorpe park with scouts and the queues were only a maximum of 1 hour and a half. Very fun went on all the rides but stealth as it was closed. All the other rides were good and only one broke down for 5 minutes as someone had lost there shoe on nemesis inferno",
          "One has to use the disabled toilets in order to change a nappy. These are signposted clearly enough but the keys are kept hidden in some top secret location that requires one to search for them - even in an emergency. There must be an easier way? Perhaps make a key available at",
          "We used to take our children here regularly, this was our first experience with grandchild. What a difference 20 years made. Very little for small children. All about big rides (with 80 minute queues). Money grabbing stalls all over. Everything extremely shabby with no TLC",
          "It's a theme park. Does what it says on the tin. Big rides and full of fun. Long ques of an hour or so but that's the part of the fun I supose.",
          "Was ok! Same price for 3 year olds as adults but only about 5 rides she could go on. Also have a teenager who was desperate to go on flying fish but it was shut all day. Didn\u2019t enjoy as much as Chessington and think younger children should be cheaper admission",
          "Thrope park is a great place to go if you want a day out which suits teens. Lots of rides and depending on when you go you will only have to wait 20 mins for a ride. Thrope park is a very time depend as if you go the wrong day you will be waiting for rides for a long time but",

          "We visited Thorpe park with 2 disabled guests one of the worst places I have ever encountered we had to wait in a que which was down a steep incline to get to we then had to wait in a wooden stall which you couldn\u2019t get the wheelchair in for over 1 hour just to get wristbands",
          "Firstly, we had to queue and then wait for manager authorisation for my son\u2019s carer pass. That took 40 minutes. Then we had to join a long queue that people were constantly trying to queue jump, to get his wrist band and permit for his ride access pass. That was another 45",
          "Loved my time at Thorpe Park, went twice last month with my daughter, however slightly disappointed due to stealth, Quantem and Sumurai not being in operation, overall the day was brilliant! We had a blast despite the long cues, for future I\u2019ll bare in mind to get a fast track,",
          "We paid for 3 adults, 3 teens, a 6 year old and an one year old. Cost us a fortune. We got there when the park opened. Waited 1 hour for the Rapids then queued for the ghost train. 3 hours we finally got Into the derren brown ghost train. What a load of trash that was. 3d",
          "Took my 8 year old daughter(9 next month) sat 6th Sep. Paid full price and she was prevented from going on the rides she really wanted too. 1 cm to short (139). Thorpe park staff not interested ruined her long-awaited day out. I will be telling my friends not to support this",
          "I loved it there have never been any delays or rides closed when I have visited. Perfect for thrill seekers alternatively it was perfect for me and my family. It\u2019s new attraction (bouncezilla) was perfect for us. Good for it\u2019s money. Going again? Of course! Even the old rides",
          "With a curiously nostalgic piped music track of endlessly repeating 1960s music, spending a day at Thorpe Park is like stepping back in time to an American theme park in the 60s or 70s. A lot of it is looking a bit down at heel, but this 'time travel' feel actually makes a day -",
          "Ok, firstly the kids loved the big rides and as we had a fast pass all day the wait was minimal so they rode their favourites repeatedly. All rides open except Stealth which was also closed last time we visited! Through adult eyes everything about the park screams dated and",

          "Brilliant day with some great rides, Saw, Swarm, Colossus all brilliant and worth the wait in line. Great attractions for all the family, staff were nice and friendly. Day spoiled by and hour and 20 mins wait to exit car park, please try and sort this situation out, I have",
          "We were there on Monday and thought it shouldn\u2019t be busy but were really disappointed. They let so many people in that the queues were horrible. Right from the start they started closing some of the rides (4-5 at the same time) so you can imagine queues for other rides. There",
          "Love thorpe park! Especially fright nights at halloween just adds something extra to the park! The rides are great with nemesis being my fave! Has a good mixture of rides. Plenty of places to eat and get refreshments. Park prices are okay - not on the cheap side - but that is",
          "I think this is probably standard for all UK parks as Merlin own the vast majority, but it's that run down poorly organised overpriced feel that you wouldn't get in other countries. Have to say staff despite being kids were all awesome and deserve praise . To the bad bits - \u00a38",
          "First time visiting and unfortunately won't be returning. We are a family of 5 (2 adults, 2 teens and an 8 Yr old). The only 2 decent rollercoaster rides the youngest could go on were both closed and she's a thrill seeker so was really disappointed plus no haunted house she",
          "The day started quite positively - we were pleasantly surprised that the ques weren't excessive and everything seems quite tidy etc. However the day was tainted when we went on the walking dead ride. Whilst walking through the first dark section my ankle was grabbed by an actor",
          "I could write an essay on how awful our visit to Thorpe Park was last weekend but I really can\u2019t be bothered so a few bullet points should be enough to show why it was so bad: Not disabled friendly at all, no signs, no help, no info. My handbag nor scooter bag were checked I was",
          "Total waste of time as the place is so rundown and dirty Save your money food is overpriced and not value for money some of the major rides not operating spike to staff who just shrugged their shoulders This place is a accident waiting to happen and staff do not seem to care",
          "Brilliant for the thrill factor, not so much for the customer service. As I walked from the hotel to the park this morning, I could hear the tannoy telling staff to provide the best customer service in order to make the day memorable for the guests. I'm afraid to say that was",

          "This park has some great rides. Its a shame they cant get them going. At no point in the day were all rides running with at least two of the big six off at the same time, and five at one point. Walking Dead ride was pathetic and Deren Browne was broken all day. Merlin need to",
          "What a wonderful day at Thorpe Park I had with my 12 year old son. We.got there for 9.45 so flew onto Collosus& Saw both were grear rides. Tidal Wave was great fun and it warned you over and over that you would get soaked and it didnt disappoint! Stealth was super fast. Had the",

          "I love a thrill ride but weirdly never made it to Thorpe Park until yesterday. Overall I was disappointed, the only thing that saved the day was the fact that the coasters we could get on were excellent, and our families ability to have a laugh and make the most of things. Don\u2019t",
          "Planned a day here as a family with an overnight stay nearby. It wasnt the worst but 2 main rides were closed with no explanation given by staff. Plenty of places to eat, I recommend the fish and chip bar. It wasnt a bad trip but when you have a teenage daughter with autism",
          "Long queues we only got 4 rides in an entire day. Queue time indicators say 60 or 70 minutes queue when it\u2019s actually 90 minutes plus. Queues seem to be managed to promote Fast Track creating an unfair experience Food super expensive we were charged \u00a327 for burger king lunch",
          "Yes I'll be the first one to admit Thorpe park does have a very neglected vibe compared to other Merlin parks. They haven't seen a new coaster in 7 years which isn't helping their poor reputation. I was dissapointed how when we booked our tickets online it showed 10-8 however on",

        "wiki": "HMSAS Bloemfontein was an Algerine-class minesweeper built for the Royal Navy in Canada during World War II. The ship was originally named Rosamund (pennant number: J439) and spent several years clearing minefields in Europe after she was completed in 1945 before she was placed in reserve. Rosamund was purchased by South Africa in 1947 and later renamed HMSAS Bloemfontein.\nThe ship spent most of its early career in the South African Navy training or making good-will visits to foreign countries. She was laid up in the late 1950s and was recommissioned in 1961 to serve as an interim training ship until the shore-based training establishment then under construction was completed. This occurred in 1963 and Bloemfontein returned to briefly returned to reserve before she was deemed surplus to requirements. The ship was sunk as a target in 1967.\n\n\n== Description ==\nBloemfontein displaced 950 long tons (965 t) at standard load and 1,250 long tons (1,270 t) at deep load. The ship had an overall length of 225 feet (68.6 m), a beam of 35 feet 6 inches (10.8 m) and a deep draught of 12 feet 3 inches (3.7 m). She was powered by a pair of vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines developed a total of 2,400 indicated horsepower (1,800 kW) which gave a maximum speed of 16.5 knots (30.6 km/h; 19.0 mph). The ship carried 230 long tons (234 t) of fuel oil that she had a range of 5,000 nautical miles (9,300 km; 5,800 mi) at 10 knots (19 km/h; 12 mph). The ship was armed with a single four-inch (102 mm) Mk V dual-purpose gun and two twin and two single mounts for Oerlikon 20-millimetre (0.8 in) light anti-aircraft (AA) guns. For anti-submarine work, Bloemfontein was fitted with two depth charge rails, and four depth charge throwers for 92 depth charges. The ship was also equipped with a Type 271 surface-search radar and a Type 291 air-search radar. Her crew numbered 85 officers and ratings.\n\n\n== Construction and career ==\nBloemfontein was ordered on 15 March 1943 from the Port Arthur Shipbuilding Company of Port Arthur, Ontario, Canada, and laid down on 26 April 1944 with the name of Rosamund. The ship was the first of her name to serve in the Royal Navy. She was launched on 20 December and completed six months later on 10 July 1945. The ship was assigned to clear the coastal waters of Western Europe of minefields laid during the war and did so until she was laid up in 1947 at Devonport Royal Dockyard. Rosamund was purchased by the South African Navy later that year, together with her sister ship, Pelorus. The sisters departed England on 22 November after a refresher course at the minesweeping school at HMS Lochinvar, Port Edgar, Scotland. They arrived at Cape Town on 24 December, making stops at Gibraltar, Freetown and Walvis Bay en route.Rosamund was rechristened as Bloemfontein in East London during that city's centenary celebrations in mid-1948. In August she made her first supply run to Marion Island. In November of that year, the sisters exercised with the British 3rd Aircraft Carrier Squadron. Later that month, together with the frigate Natal, they visited ports in Portuguese Mozambique, returning to Durban on 12 December. The sisters were placed in reserve in the late 1950s, after the navy had purchased 10 Ton-class minesweepers. Bloemfontein was recommissioned in April 1961 to serve as a stationary training ship in Simon's Town until the navy's training facility SAS Simonsberg was completed in July 1963. The navy decided that the ship was no longer needed and she was stripped of useful equipment before being sunk as a target in False Bay by the frigate President Kruger and the minesweeper SAS Johannesburg on 5 June 1967.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\nColledge, J.

        "wiki": "Afrikaners (Afrikaans: [afri\u02c8k\u0251\u02d0n\u0259rs]) are a Southern African ethnic group descended from predominantly Dutch settlers first arriving at the Cape of Good Hope in the 17th and 18th centuries. They traditionally dominated South Africa's politics and commercial agricultural sector prior to 1994.Afrikaans, South Africa's third most widely spoken home language, evolved as the mother tongue of Cape Coloureds. and was taught to colonial settlers by the slaves. It originated from the Dutch vernacular of South Holland, incorporating words brought from the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) and Madagascar by slaves. Afrikaners make up approximately 5.2% of the total South African population based on the number of white South Africans who speak Afrikaans as a first language in the South African National Census of 2011.The arrival of Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama at Calicut in 1498 opened a gateway of free access to Asia from Western Europe around the Cape of Good Hope; however, it also necessitated the founding and safeguarding of trade stations in the East. The Portuguese landed in Mossel Bay in 1500, explored Table Bay two years later, and by 1510 had started raiding inland. Shortly afterwards the Dutch Republic sent merchant vessels to India, and in 1602 founded the Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (Dutch East India Company; VOC). As the volume of traffic rounding the Cape increased, the Company recognised its natural harbour as an ideal watering point for the long voyage around Africa to the Orient and established a victualling station there in 1652. VOC officials did not favour the permanent settlement of Europeans in their trading empire, although during the 140 years of Dutch rule many VOC servants retired or were discharged and remained as private citizens. Furthermore, the exigencies of supplying local garrisons and passing fleets compelled the administration to confer free status upon employees and oblige them to become independent farmers.Encouraged by the success of this experiment, the Company extended free passage from 1685 to 1707 for Hollanders wishing to settle at the Cape. In 1688 it sponsored the immigration of 200 French Huguenot refugees forced into exile by the Edict of Fontainebleau. The terms under which the Huguenots agreed to immigrate were the same offered to other VOC subjects, including free passage and requisite farm equipment on credit. Prior attempts at cultivating vineyards or exploiting olive groves for fruit had been unsuccessful, and it was hoped that Huguenot colonists accustomed to Mediterranean agriculture could succeed where the Dutch had failed. They were augmented by VOC soldiers returning from Asia, predominantly Germans channeled into Amsterdam by the Company's extensive recruitment network and thence overseas. Despite their diverse nationalities, the colonists used a common language and adopted similar attitudes towards politics. The attributes they shared came to serve as a basis for the evolution of Afrikaner identity and consciousness.Afrikaner nationalism has taken the form of political parties and secret societies such as the Broederbond in the twentieth century. In 1914 the National Party was formed to promote Afrikaner economic interests and sever South Africa's ties to the United Kingdom. Rising to prominence by winning the 1948 general elections, it has also been noted for enforcing a harsh policy of racial segregation (apartheid) while simultaneously declaring South Africa a republic and withdrawing from the British Commonwealth. The National Party left power in 1994 following bilateral negotiations to end apartheid and South Africa's first multiracial elections held under a universal franchise.\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\nThe term \"Afrikaner\" (formerly sometimes in the forms Afrikaander or Afrikaaner, from the Dutch Africaaner) presently denotes the politically, culturally and socially dominant group among white South Africans, or the Afrikaans-speaking population of Dutch origin. Their original progenitors, especially in paternal lines, also included smaller numbers of Flemish, French Huguenot, and German immigrants. Historically, the terms \"burgher\" and \"Boer\" have both been used to describe white Afrikaans-speakers as a group; neither is particularly objectionable, but \"Afrikaner\" has been considered a more appropriate term.By the late nineteenth century, the term was in common usage in both the Boer republics and in the Cape Colony. At one time, burghers denoted Cape Dutch: those settlers who were influential in the administration, able to participate in urban affairs, and did so regularly. Boers often referred to the settled ethnic European farmers or to nomadic cattle-herders. During the Batavian Republic of 1795-1806, \"burgher\" (or citizen) was popularised among Dutch communities both at home and abroad as a popular revolutionary form of address. In South Africa it remained in use as late as the Second Boer War of 1899-1902.The first recorded instance of a colonist identifying as an \"Afrikaner\" occurred in March 1707, during a disturbance in Stellenbosch. When the magistrate, Johannes Starrenburg, ordered an unruly crowd to desist, a young white man named Hendrik Biebouw retorted, \"Ik wil niet loopen, ik ben een Afrikaander \u2013 al slaat de landdrost mij dood, of al zetten hij mij in de tronk, ik zal, nog wil niet zwijgen!\" (\"I will not leave, I am an African \u2013 even if the magistrate were to beat me to death, or put me in jail, I shall not be, nor will I stay, silent!\"). Biebouw was flogged for his insolence and later banished to Batavia (present-day Jakarta in Indonesia). The word \"Afrikaner\" is thought to have first been used to classify Cape Coloureds, or other groups of colour claiming mixed-race ancestry. Biebouw had numerous \"half-caste\" (mixed race) siblings and may have identified with Coloureds socially. The growing use of the term appeared to express the rise of a new identity for white South Africans, suggesting for the first time a group identification with the Cape Colony rather than with any ancestral homeland in Europe.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n=== 1691 estimates ===\n\nThe Dutch East India Company (VOC) initially had no intention of planting a permanent European settlement at the Cape of Good Hope; until 1657 it devoted as little attention as possible to the development or administration of the Dutch Cape Colony. From the VOC's perspective, there was little financial incentive to regard the region as anything more than the site of a strategic victualing centre. Furthermore, the Cape was unpopular among VOC employees, who regarded it as a barren and insignificant outpost with little opportunity for advancement.A small number of longtime VOC employees who had been instrumental in the colony's founding and its first five years of existence, however, expressed interest in applying for grants of land, with the objective of retiring at the Cape as farmers. In time they came to form a class of \"vrijlieden\", also known as \"vrijburgers\" (free citizens), former VOC employees who stayed in Dutch territories overseas after serving their contracts. The \"vrijburgers\" were to be of Dutch birth (although exceptions were made for some Germans), married, 'of good character', and had to undertake to spend at least twenty years in Southern Africa. In March 1657, when the first \"vrijburgers\" started receiving their farms, the white population of the Cape was only about 134. Although the soil and climate in Cape Town were suitable for farming, willing immigrants remained in short supply and included a number of orphans, refugees, and foreigners accordingly. From 1688 onward the Cape attracted some French Huguenots, most of them refugees from the protracted conflict between Protestants and Catholics in France.South Africa's white population in 1691 has been described as the Afrikaner \"parent stock\", as no significant effort was made to secure more colonist families after the dawn of the 18th century, and a majority of Afrikaners are descended from progenitors who arrived prior to 1700 in general and the late 1600s in particular. Although some two-thirds of this figure were Dutch-speaking Hollanders, there were at least 150 Huguenots and a nearly equal number of Low German speakers. Also represented in smaller numbers were Swedes, Danes, and Belgians.\n\n\n=== 1754 estimates ===\nIn 1754, Cape governor Ryk Tulbagh conducted a census of his non-indigenous subjects. White vrijburgers, now outnumbered by slaves imported from West Africa, Mozambique, Madagascar and the Dutch East Indies, only totaled about 6,000.\n\n\n=== 1806 estimates ===\nFollowing the defeat and collapse of the Dutch Republic during Joseph Souham's Flanders Campaign, William V, Prince of Orange escaped to the United Kingdom and appealed to the British to occupy his colonial possessions until he was restored. Holland's administration was never effectively reestablished; upon a new outbreak of hostilities with France expeditionary forces led by Sir David Baird, 1st Baronet finally imposed British rule for good when they defeated Cape governor Jan Willem Janssens in 1806.At the onset of Cape Town's annexation to the British Empire, the original Afrikaners numbered 26,720 \u2013 or 36% of the colony's population.\n\n\n=== 1960 Census ===\nThe South African census of 1960 was the final census undertaken in the Union of South Africa. Ethno-linguistic status of some 15,994,181 South African citizens was projected by various sources through sampling language, religion and race. At least 1.6 million South Africans represented white Afrikaans speakers, or 10% of the total population. They also constituted 9.3% of the population in neighbouring South West Africa.\n\n\n=== 1985 Census ===\nAccording to the South African census of 1985, there were 2,581,080 white Afrikaans speakers then residing in the country, or about 9.4% of the total population.\n\n\n=== 1996 Census ===\nThe South African National Census of 1996 was the first census conducted in post-apartheid South Africa. It was calculated on census day and reported a population of 2,558,956 white Afrikaans speakers. The census noted that Afrikaners represented the eighth largest ethnic group in the country, or 6.3% of the total population. Even after the end of Apartheid the ethnic group only fell by 25,000 people.\n\n\n=== 2001 Census ===\nThe South African National Census of 2001 was the second census conducted in post-apartheid South Africa. It was calculated on 9 October and reported a population of 2,576,184 white Afrikaans speakers. The census noted that Afrikaners represented the eighth largest ethnic group in the country, or 5.7% of the total population.\n\n\n==== Distribution ====\n\nAfrikaners make up approximately 58% of South Africa's white population, based on language used in the home. English speakers \u2013 an ethnically diverse group \u2013 account for closer to 37%. As in Canada or the United States, most modern European immigrants elect to learn English and are likelier to identify with those descended from British colonials of the nineteenth century.  Aside from coastal pockets in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal they remain heavily outnumbered by those of Afrikaans origin.\n\n\n=== 2011 Census ===\nThe South African National Census of 2011 have counted 2,710,461 white South Africans who speak Afrikaans as a first language, or approximately 5.23% of the total South African population. The census also shown, an increase of 5.21% in Afrikaner population comparing to the previous 2001 census.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early Dutch settlement ===\n\nThe earliest Afrikaner communities in South Africa were formed at the Cape of Good Hope, mainly through the introduction of Dutch colonists, French Huguenot refugees and erstwhile servants of the Dutch East India Company. During the early colonial period, Afrikaners were generally known as \"Christians\", \"colonists\", \"emigrants\", or ingezeetenen (\"inhabitants\"). Their concept of being rooted in Africa\u2014as opposed to the Company's expatriate officialdom\u2014did not find widespread expression until the late eighteenth century.It is to the ambitions of Prince Henry the Navigator that historians attribute the discovery of the Cape as a settling ground for Europeans. In 1424 Henry and Fernando de Castro besieged the Canary Islands, under the impression that they might be of use to further Portuguese expeditions around Africa's coast. Although this attempt was unsuccessful, Portugal's continued interest in the continent made possible the later voyages of Bartholomew Diaz in 1487 and Vasco de Gama ten years later. Diaz made known to the world a \"Cape of Storms\", rechristened \"Good Hope\" by John II. As it was desirable to take formal possession of this territory the Portuguese erected a stone cross in Algoa Bay. Da Gama and his successors, however, did not take kindly to the notion, especially following a skirmish with the Khoikhoi in 1497, when one of his admirals was wounded.After the British East India Company was founded in 1599, London merchants began to take advantage of the route to India by the Cape. James Lancaster, who had visited Robben Island some years earlier, anchored in Table Bay in 1601. By 1614 the British had planted a penal colony on the site, and in 1621 two Englishmen claimed Table Bay on behalf of King James I, but this action was not ratified. They eventually settled on Saint Helena as an alternative port of refuge.Due to the value of the spice trade between Europe and their outposts in the East Indies, Dutch ships began to call sporadically at the Cape in search of provisions after 1598. In 1601 a Captain Paul van Corniden came ashore at St. Sebastion's Bay near Overberg. He discovered a small inlet which he named Vleesch Bay, after the cattle trade, and another Visch Bay after the abundance of fish. Not long afterwards, Admiral Joris van Spilbergen reported catching penguins and sheep on Robben Island.In 1648, Dutch sailors Leendert Jansz and Nicholas Proot had been shipwrecked in Table Bay and marooned for five months until picked up by a returning ship. During this period they established friendly relations with the locals, who sold them sheep, cattle, and vegetables. Both men presented a report advocating the Table valley as a fort and garden for the East India fleets.\nWe say, therefore, that the Honourable Company, by the formation of a fort or redoubt, and also of a garden of such size as may be practicable or necessary at the above-mentioned Cabo de Boa Esperanza, upon a suitable spot in Table Valley, stationing there according to your pleasure sixty to seventy as well soldiers as sailors, and a few persons acquainted with gardening and horticulture, could raise, as well for the ships and people bound to India as for those returning thence, many kinds of fruit, as will hereafter be more particularly demonstrated.\nUnder recommendation from Jan van Riebeeck, the Heeren XVII authorised the establishment of a fort at the Cape, and this the more hurriedly to preempt any further imperial maneuvers by Britain, France or Portugal. Van Riebeeck, his family and seventy to eighty VOC personnel arrived there on 6 April 1652 after a journey of three and a half months. Their immediate task was the establishment of some gardens, \"taking for this purpose all the best and richest ground\"; following this they were instructed to conduct a survey to determine the best pastureland for the grazing of cattle. By 15 May they had nearly completed construction on the Castle of Good Hope, which was to be an easily defensible victualing station serving Dutch ships plying the Indian Ocean. Dutch sailors appreciated the mild climate at the Cape, which allowed them to recuperate from their protracted periods of service in the tropical humidity of Southeast Asia. VOC fleets bearing cargo from the Orient anchored in the Cape for a month, usually from March or April, when they were resupplied with water and provisions prior to completing their return voyage to the Netherlands.In extent the new refreshment post was to be kept as confined as possible to reduce administrative expense. Residents would associate amiably with the natives for the sake of livestock trade, but otherwise keep to themselves and their task of becoming self-sufficient. As the VOC's primary goal was merchant enterprise, particularly its shipping network traversing the Atlantic and Indian Oceans between the Netherlands and various ports in Asia, most of its territories consisted of coastal forts, factories, and isolated trading posts dependent entirely on indigenous host states. The exercise of Dutch sovereignty, as well the large scale settlement of Dutch colonists, was therefore extremely limited at these sites. During the VOC's history only two primary exceptions to the rule emerged: the Dutch East Indies and the Cape of Good Hope, through the formation of a large class of \"vrijlieden\", or \"vrijburgers\" (free citizens).The VOC operated under a strict corporate hierarchy which allowed it to formally assign classifications to those whom it determined fell within its legal purview. Most Europeans within the VOC's registration and identification system were denoted either as Company employees or vrijburgers. The legal classifications imposed upon every individual in the Company possessions determined their position in society and conferred restraints upon their actions. VOC ordinances made a clear distinction between the \"bonded\" period of service, and the period of \"freedom\" that began once an employment contract ended. In order to ensure former employees could be distinguished from workers still in the service of the Company, it was decided to provide them a \"letter of freedom\", a licence known as a vrijbrief. European employees were repatriated to the Netherlands upon the termination of their contract, unless they successfully applied for a vrijbrief, in which they were charged a small fee and registered as vrijburgers in a Company record known collectively as the vrijboeken. Fairly strict conditions were levied on those who aspired to become vrijburgers at the Cape of Good Hope. They had to be married Dutch citizens who were regarded as being \"of good character\" by the VOC and committed to at least twenty years' residence in South Africa. Reflecting the multi-national nature of the workforce of the early modern trading companies, some foreigners, particularly Germans, were open to consideration as well. If their application for vrijburger status was successful, the Company granted them plots of farmland of thirteen and a half morgen, which were tax exempt for twelve years. They were also loaned tools and seeds. The extent of their farming activities, however, remained heavily regulated: for example, the vrijburgers were ordered to focus on the cultivation of grain. Each year their harvest was to be sold exclusively to the VOC at fixed prices. They were forbidden from growing tobacco, producing vegetables for any purpose other than personal consumption, or purchasing cattle from the native Khoikhoi at rates which differed from those set by the VOC. With time, these restrictions and other attempts by the VOC to control the settlers resulted in successive generations of vrijburgers and their descendants becoming increasingly localised in their loyalties and national identity and hostile towards the colonial government.Around March 1657, Rijcklof van Goens, a senior VOC officer appointed as commissioner to the fledgling Dutch Cape Colony, ordered Jan van Riebeeck to help more employees succeed as vriburgers so the Company could save on their wages. Although an overwhelming majority of the vrijburgers were farmers, some also stated their intention to seek employment as farm managers, fishermen, wagon-makers, tailors, or hunters. A ship's carpenter was granted a tract of forest, from which he was permitted to sell timber, and one miller from Holland opened his own water-operated corn mill, the first of its kind in Southern Africa. The colony initially did not do well, and many of the discouraged vrijburgers returned to VOC service or sought passage back to the Netherlands to pursue other opportunities. Vegetable gardens were frequently destroyed by storms, and cattle lost in raids by the Khoikhoi, who were known to the Dutch as Hottentots. There was also an unskilled labour shortage, which the VOC later resolved by importing slaves from Angola, Madagascar, and the East Indies.In 1662 van Riebeeck was succeeded by Zacharias Wagenaer as governor of the Cape. Wagenaer was somewhat aloof towards the vrijburgers, whom he dismissed as \"sodden, lazy, clumsy louts...since they do not pay proper attention to the [slaves] lent to them, or to their work in the fields, nor to their animals, for that reason seem wedded to the low level and cannot rid themselves of their debts\". When Wagenaer arrived, he observed that many of the unmarried vrijburgers were beginning to cohabit with their slaves, with the result that 75% of children born to Cape slaves at the time had a Dutch father. Wagenaer's response was to sponsor the immigration of Dutch women to the colony as potential wives for the settlers. Upon the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Dutch War, Wagenaer was perturbed by the British capture of New Amsterdam and attacks on other Dutch outposts in the Americas and on the west African coast. He increased the Cape garrison by about 300 troops and replaced the original earthen fortifications of the Castle of Good Hope with new ones of stone.In 1672 there were 300 VOC officials, employees, soldiers and sailors at the Cape, compared to only about 64 vrijburgers, 39 of whom were married, with 65 children. By 1687 the number had increased to about 254 vrijburgers, of whom 77 were married, with 231 children. Simon van der Stel, who was appointed governor of the Cape in 1679, reversed the VOC's earlier policy of keeping the colony limited to the confines of the Cape peninsula itself and encouraged Dutch settlement further abroad, resulting in the founding of Stellenbosch. Van der Stel persuaded 30 vrijburgers to settle in Stellenbosch and a few years afterwards the town received its own municipal administration and school. The VOC was persuaded to seek more prospective European immigrants for the Cape after local officials noted that the cost of maintaining gardens to provision passing ships could be eliminated by outsourcing to a greater number of vrijburgers. Furthermore, the size of the Cape garrison could be reduced if there were many colonists capable of being called up for militia service as needed.Following the passage of the Edict of Fontainebleau, the Netherlands served as a major destination for French Huguenot refugees fleeing persecution at home. In April 1688, the VOC agreed to sponsor the resettlement of over 100 Huguenots at the Cape. Smaller numbers of Huguenots gradually arrived over the next decade, and by 1702 the community numbered close to 200. Between 1689 and 1707 they were augmented by additional numbers of Dutch settlers sponsored by the VOC with grants of land and free passage to Africa. Additionally, there were calls from the VOC administration to sponsor the immigration of more German settlers to the Cape, as long as they were Protestant. VOC pamphlets began circulating in German cities exhorting the urban poor to seek their fortune in southern Africa. Despite the increasing diversity of the colonial population, there was a degree of cultural assimilation due to intermarriage, and the almost universal adoption of the Dutch language. The use of other European languages was discouraged by a VOC edict declaring that Dutch should be the exclusive language of education, administrative record, and education. In 1752 the French astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille visited the Cape and observed that the nearly all the third generation descendants of the original Huguenot and German settlers spoke Dutch as a first language.\n\n\n=== Impact of the British occupation of the Cape ===\n\nLong before the British annexed the Cape Colony, there were already large Dutch-speaking European settlements in the Cape Peninsula and beyond; by the time British rule became permanent in 1806 these had a population of over 26,000. There were, however, two distinct subgroups in the vrijburger population settled under the VOC. The first were itinerant farmers who began to progressively settle further and further inland, seeking better pastures for their livestock and freedom from the VOC's petty regulations. This community of settlers collectively identified themselves as Boers to describe their agricultural way of life. Their farms were enormous by European standards, as the land was free and relatively underpopulated; they merely had to register them with the VOC, a process that was little more than a formality and became more irrelevant the further the Boers moved inland. A few Boers adopted a semi-nomadic lifestyle permanently and became known as trekboers. The Boers were deeply suspicious of the centralised government and increasing complexities of administration at the Cape; they constantly migrated further from the reaches of the colonial officialdom whenever it attempted to regulate their activities. By the mid eighteenth century the Boers had penetrated almost a thousand kilometres into South Africa's interior beyond the Cape of Good Hope, at which point they encountered the Xhosa people, who were migrating southwards from the opposite direction. Competition between the two communities over resources on the frontier sparked the Xhosa Wars. Harsh Boer attitudes towards black Africans were permanently shaped by their contact with the Xhosa, which bred insecurity and fear on the frontier.The second subgroup of the vrijburger population became known as the Cape Dutch and remained concentrated in the southwestern Cape and especially the areas closer to Cape Town. They were likelier to be urban dwellers, more educated, and typically maintained greater cultural ties to the Netherlands than the Boers. The Cape Dutch formed the backbone of the colony's market economy and included the small entrepreneurial class. These colonists had vested economic interests in the Cape peninsula and were not inclined to venture inland because of the great difficulties in maintaining contact with a viable market. This was in sharp contrast with the Boers on the frontier, who lived on the margins of the market economy. For this reason the Cape Dutch could not easily participate in migrations to escape the colonial system, and the Boer strategy of social and economic withdrawal was not viable for them. Their response to grievances with the Cape government was to demand political reform and greater representation, a practice that became commonplace under Dutch and subsequently British rule. In 1779, for example, hundreds of Cape burghers smuggled a petition to Amsterdam demanding an end to VOC corruption and contradictory laws. Unlike the Boers, the contact most Cape Dutch had with black Africans were predominantly peaceful, and their racial attitudes were more paternal than outright hostile.Meanwhile, the VOC underwent a period of commercial decline beginning in the late eighteenth century which ultimately resulted in its bankruptcy. The company had suffered immense losses to its trade profits as a result of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War and was heavily in debt with European creditors. In 1794 the Dutch government intervened and assumed formal administration of the Cape Colony. However, events at the Cape were overtaken by turmoil in the Netherlands, which was occupied by Napoleon during the Flanders Campaign. This opened the Cape to French naval fleets. To protect her own prosperous maritime shipping routes, Great Britain occupied the fledgling colony by force until 1803. From 1806 to 1814 the Cape was again governed as a British military dependency, whose sole importance to the Royal Navy was its strategic relation to Indian maritime traffic. The British formally assumed permanent administrative control around 1815, as a result of the Treaty of Paris.Relations between some of the colonists and the new British administration quickly soured. The British brought liberal attitudes towards slavery and treatment of the indigenous peoples to the Cape, which were utterly alien to the colonists. Furthermore, they insisted that the Cape Colony finance its own affairs by taxes levied on the white population, an unpopular measure which bred resentment. By 1812 new attorneys-general and judges had been imported from England and many of the preexisting VOC era institutions abolished, namely the Dutch magistrate system and the only vestige of representative government at the Cape, the burgher senate. The new judiciary then established circuit courts, which brought colonial authority directly to the frontier. These circuit courts were permitted to try colonists for any alleged abuses of their slaves or indentured servants. Most of those tried for these offences were frontier Boers; the charges were usually brought by British missionaries and the courts themselves staffed by unsympathetic and liberal Cape Dutch. The Boers, who  perceived most of the charges levelled against them to be flimsy or exaggerated, often refused to answer their court summons.In 1815, a Cape police unit was dispatched to arrest a Boer for failure to appear in court on charges of cruelty towards his Khoisan servants; the colonist fired on the troopers when they entered his property and was killed. The controversy which surrounded the incident led to the abortive Slachter's Nek Rebellion, in which a number of Boers took up arms against the British. British officials retaliated by hanging five Boers for insurrection. In 1828 the Cape governor declared that all native inhabitants but slaves were to have the rights of citizens, in respect of security and property ownership, on parity with whites. This had the effect of further alienating the Boers. Boer resentment of successive British administrators continued to grow throughout the late 1820s and early 1830s, especially with the official imposition of the English language. This replaced Dutch with English as the language used in the Cape's judicial system, putting the Boers at a disadvantage, as most spoke little or no English at all.Bridling at what they considered an unwarranted intrusion into their way of life, some in the Boer community began to consider selling their farms and venturing deep into South Africa's unmapped interior to preempt further disputes and live completely independent from British rule. From their perspective, the Slachter's Nek Rebellion had demonstrated the futility of an armed uprising against the new order the British had entrenched at the Cape; one result was that the Boers who might have otherwise been inclined to take up arms began preparing for a mass emigration from the colony instead.\n\n\n=== The Great Trek ===\n\nIn the 1830s and 1840s, an organised migration of an estimated 14,000 Boers, known as voortrekkers, across the Cape Colony's frontier began. The voortrekkers departed the colony in a series of parties, taking with them all their livestock and portable property, as well as their dependents and slaves. They had the skills to maintain their own wagons and firearms, but remained dependent on equally mobile traders for vital commodities such as gunpowder and sugar. Nevertheless, one of their goals was to sever their ties with the Cape's commercial network by gaining access to foreign traders and ports in east Africa, well beyond the British sphere of influence.Many of the Boers who participated in the Great Trek had varying motives. While most were driven by some form of disenchantment with British policies, their secondary objectives ranged from seeking more desirable grazing land for their cattle to a desire to retain their slaves after the abolition of slavery at the Cape. The Great Trek also split the Afrikaner community along social and geographical lines, driving a wedge between the voortrekkers and those who remained in the Cape Colony. Only about a fifth of the colony's Dutch-speaking white population at the time participated in the Great Trek. The Dutch Reformed Church, to which most of the Boers belonged, condemned the migration. Despite their hostility towards the British, there were also Boers who chose to remain in the Cape of their own accord. For its part, the distinct Cape Dutch community remained loyal to the British Crown and focused its efforts on building political organisations seeking representative government; its lobbying efforts were partly responsible for the establishment of the Cape Qualified Franchise in 1853.\n\nAs important as the Trek was to the formation of Boer ethnic identity, so were the running conflicts with various indigenous groups along the way. One conflict central to the construction of Boer identity occurred with the Zulu in the area of present-day KwaZulu-Natal.\nThe Boers who entered Natal discovered that the land they wanted came under the authority of the Zulu King Dingane ka Senzangakhona, who ruled that part of what subsequently became KwaZulu-Natal. The British had a small port colony (the future Durban) there but were unable to seize the whole of area from the war-ready Zulus, and only kept to the Port of Natal. The Boers found the land safe from the British and sent an un-armed Boer land treaty delegation under Piet Retief on 6 February 1838, to negotiate with the Zulu King. The negotiations went well and a contract between Retief and Dingane was signed.\nAfter the signing, however, Dingane's forces surprised and killed the members of the delegation; a large-scale massacre of the Boers followed. Zulu impis (regiments) attacked Boer encampments in the Drakensberg foothills at what was later called Blaauwkrans and Weenen, killing women and children along with men. (By contrast, in earlier conflicts the trekkers had experienced along the eastern Cape frontier, the Xhosa had refrained from harming women and children.)\nA commando of 470 men arrived to help the settlers. On 16 December 1838, the Voortrekkers under the command of Andries Pretorius confronted about 10,000 Zulus at the prepared positions. The Boers suffered three injuries without any fatalities. Due to the blood of 3,000 slain Zulus that stained the Ncome River, the conflict afterwards became known as the Battle of Blood River.\nIn present-day South Africa, 16 December remains a celebrated public holiday, initially called \"Dingane's Day\". After 1952, the holiday was officially named Day of the Covenant, changed to Day of the Vow in 1980 (Mackenzie 1999:69)  and to Day of Reconciliation in 1994. The Boers saw their victory at the Battle of Blood River as evidence that they had found divine favour for their exodus from British rule.\n\n\n=== Boer republics ===\n\nAfter defeating the Zulu and the recovery of the treaty between Dingane and Retief, the Voortrekkers proclaimed the Natalia Republic. In 1843, Britain annexed Natal and many Boers trekked inwards again.\nDue to the return of British rule, Boers fled to the frontiers to the north-west of the Drakensberg mountains, and onto the highveld of the Transvaal and Transoranje. These areas were mostly unoccupied due to conflicts in the course of the genocide Mfecane wars of the Zulus on the local Basuthu population who used it as summer grazing for their cattle. Some Boers ventured far beyond the present-day borders of South Africa, north as far as present-day Zambia and Angola. Others reached the Portuguese colony of Delagoa Bay, later called Louren\u00e7o Marques and subsequently Maputo \u2013 the capital of Mozambique.\n\nThe Boers created sovereign states in what is now South Africa: de Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (the South African Republic) and the Orange Free State were the most prominent and lasted the longest.\nThe discovery of goldfields awakened British interest in the Boer republics, and the two Boer Wars resulted: The First Boer War (1880\u20131881) and the Second Boer War (1899\u20131902). The Boers won the first war and retained their independence. The second ended with British victory and annexation of the Boer areas into the British colonies. The British employed scorched-earth tactics and held many Boers in concentration camps as a means to separate commandos from their source of shelter, food and supply. The strategy was employed effectively but an estimated 27,000 Boers (mainly women and children under sixteen) died in these camps from hunger and disease.\n\n\n=== Post Boer War diaspora ===\n\nIn the 1890s, some Boers trekked into Mashonaland, where they were concentrated at the town of Enkeldoorn, now Chivhu.  After the second Boer War, more Boers left South Africa. Starting in 1902 to 1908 a large group of around 650 Afrikaners emigrated to the Patagonia region of Argentina (most notably to the towns of Comodoro Rivadavia and Sarmiento), choosing to settle there due to its similarity to the Karoo region of South Africa.Another group emigrated to British-ruled Kenya, from where most returned to South Africa during the 1930s as a result of warfare there amongst indigenous people. A third group, under the leadership of General Ben Viljoen, emigrated to Chihuahua in northern Mexico and to the states of Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas in the south-western USA. Others migrated to other parts of Africa, including German East Africa (present day Tanzania, mostly near Arusha).\nA significant number of Afrikaners also went as \"Dorsland Trekkers\" to Angola, where a large group settled on the Hu\u00edla Plateau, in Humpata, and smaller communities on the Central Highlands. They constituted a closed community which rejected integration as well as innovation, became impoverished in the course of several decades, and returned to South West Africa and South Africa in waves. \nA relatively large group of Boers settled in Kenya. The first wave of migrants consisted of individual families, followed by larger multiple-family treks.  Some had arrived by 1904, as documented by the caption of a newspaper photograph noting a tent town for \"some of the early settlers from South Africa\" on what became the campus of the University of Nairobi. Probably the first to arrive was W.J. Van Breda (1903), followed by John de Waal and Frans Arnoldi at Nakuru (1906).  Jannie De Beer's family resided at Athi River, while Ignatius Gouws resided at Solai.The second wave of migrants is exemplified by Jan Janse van Rensburg's trek. Janse van Rensburg left the Transvaal on an exploratory trip to British East Africa in 1906 from Louren\u00e7o Marques (then Portuguese), Mozambique. Janse van Rensburg was inspired by an earlier Boer migrant, Abraham Joubert, who had moved to Nairobi from Arusha in 1906, along with others. When Joubert visited the Transvaal that year, Janse van Rensburg met with him. Sources disagree about whether Janse van Rensburg received guarantees for land from the Governor of the East Africa Protectorate, Sir James Hayes Sadler.On his return to the Transvaal, van Rensburg recruited about 280 Afrikaners (comprising either 47 or 60 families) to accompany him to British East Africa. On 9 July 1908 his party sailed in the chartered ship SS Windhuk from Louren\u00e7o Marques to Mombasa, from where they boarded a train for Nairobi. The party travelled by five trains to Nakuru.In 1911 the last of the large trek groups departed for Kenya, when some 60 families from the Orange Free State boarded the SS Skramstad in Durban under leadership of C.J. Cloete. But migration dwindled, partly due to the British secretary of state's (then Lord Crewe) cash requirements for immigrants. When the British granted self-government to the former Boer republics of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State in 1906 and 1907, respectively, the pressure for emigration decreased. A trickle of individual trekker families continued to migrate into the 1950s.A combination of factors spurred on Boer migration. Some, like Janse van Rensburg and Cloete, had collaborated with the British, or had surrendered during the Boer War. These joiners and hensoppers (\"hands-uppers\") subsequently experienced hostility from other Afrikaners. Many migrants were extremely poor and had subsisted on others' property. Collaborators tended to move to British East Africa, while those who had fought to the end (called bittereinders) initially preferred German South West Africa.One of the best known Boer settlements in the British East Africa Protectorate became established at Eldoret, in the south west of what became known as Kenya in 1920. By 1934 some 700 Boers lived here, near the Uganda border.\n\n\n=== South West Africa ===\n\nWith the onset of the First World War in 1914, the Allies asked the Union of South Africa to attack the German territory of South West Africa, resulting in the South West Africa Campaign (1914\u20131915). Armed forces under the leadership of General Louis Botha defeated the German forces, who were unable to put up much resistance to the overwhelming South African forces.\n\nMany Boers, who had little love or respect for Britain, objected to the use of the \"children from the concentration camps\" to attack the anti-British Germans, resulting in the Maritz Rebellion of 1914, which was quickly quelled by the government forces.\nSome Boers subsequently moved to South West Africa, which was administered by South Africa until its independence in 1990, after which the country adopted the name Namibia.\n\n\n== Genealogy ==\nScholars have traditionally considered Afrikaners to be a homogeneous population of Dutch ancestry, subject to a significant founder effect. This simplistic viewpoint has been challenged by recent studies suggesting multiple uncertainties regarding the genetic composition of white South Africans at large and Afrikaners in particular.Afrikaners are descended, to varying degrees, from Dutch, German and French Huguenot immigrants, along with minor percentages of other Europeans and indigenous African peoples. The first mixed race marriage which took place in Cape Town in 1664 was that of Krotoa, a Khoi woman, and Peder Havgaard, a Danish surgeon. Krotoa and Peder's descendants are the Pelzer, Kruger, Steenkamp and other Afrikaner families. Although the Cape Colony was administered and initially settled by the Dutch East India Company (VOC), a number of foreigners also boarded ships in the Netherlands to settle there. Their numbers can be easily reconstructed from censuses of the Cape rather than passenger lists, taking into account VOC employees who later returned to Europe. Some Europeans also arrived from elsewhere in Holland's sphere, especially German soldiers being discharged from colonial service. As a result, by 1691 over a quarter of the white population of South Africa was not ethnically Dutch. The number of permanent settlers of both sexes and all ages, according to figures available at the onset of British rule, numbered 26,720, of whom 50% were Dutch, 27% German, 17% French and 5.5% other blood. This demographic breakdown of the community just prior to the end of the Dutch administration has been used in many subsequent studies to represent the ethnic makeup of modern Afrikaners, a practise criticised by some academics such as Dr. Johannes Heese.\n\nBased on his genealogical research of the period from 1657 to 1867, Dr. Johannes Heese in his study Die Herkoms van die Afrikaners estimated an average ethnic admixture for Afrikaners of 35.5% Dutch, 34.4% German, 13.9% French, 7.2% non-European, 2.6% English, 2.8% other European and 3.6% unknown. Heese achieved this conclusion by recording all the wedding dates and number of children of each immigrant. He then divided the period between 1657 and 1867 into six thirty-year blocs, and working under the assumption that earlier colonists contributed more to the gene pool, multiplied each child's bloodline by 32, 16, 8, 4, 2 and 1 according to respective period. Heese argued that previous studies wrongly classified some German progenitors as Dutch, although for the purposes of his own study he also reclassified a number of Scandinavian (especially Danish) progenitors as \"German\". Drawing heavily on Christoffel Coetzee de Villiers's Geslacht Register der Oude Kaapsche Familien, British historian George McCall Theal estimated an admixture of 67% Dutch, with a nearly equal contribution of roughly 17% from the Huguenots and Germans. Theal argued that most studies suggesting a higher percentage of German ancestry among Afrikaners wrongly counted as \"German\" all those who came from German-speaking Swiss cantons and ignored the VOC's policy of recruiting settlers among the Dutch diaspora living in the border regions of several German states. He also pointed out the longstanding preponderance of Dutch women in the colony, and the fact that most of the German vrijburgers took Dutch wives.The degree of intermixing among Afrikaners may be attributed to the unbalanced sex ratio which existed under Dutch governance. Only a handful of VOC employees who sailed from the Netherlands were allowed to bring their families with them, and the Dutch never employed European women in a full-time capacity. Between 1657 and 1806 no more than 454 women arrived at the Cape, as compared to the 1,590 male colonists. One of the most fundamental demographic consequences was that white South African women, much like their counterparts in colonial North America, began to marry much younger and consequently bear more children than Western Europeans. Another was the astonishingly high occurrence of inter-family marriages from the matrilineal aspect. These were reinforced by the familial interdependence of the Cape's credit and mortgage obligations. Afrikaner families thus became larger in size, more interconnected, and clannish than those of any other colonial establishment in the world. Some of the more common Afrikaner surnames include Botha, Pretorius and van der Merwe. As in other cases where large population groups have been propagated by a relatively small pool of progenitors, Afrikaners have also experienced a dramatic increase in the frequency of some otherwise rare deleterious ailments, including variegate porphyria.\n\n\n=== Non-European ancestry ===\nAccording to a genetic study in February 2019, almost all Afrikaners have admixture from non-Europeans. The total amount of non-European ancestry is 4.8%, of which 2.1% are of African ancestry and 2.7% Asian/Native American ancestry.  Among the 77 Afrikaners investigated, 6.5% had more than 10% non-European admixture, 27.3% had between 5 and 10%, 59.7% had between 1 and 5%, and 6.5% below 1%. It appears that some 3.4% of the non-European admixture can be traced to enslaved peoples who were brought to the Cape from other regions during colonial times. Only 1.38% of the admixture is attributed to the local Khoe-San people.\n\n\n== Black Afrikaners ==\nApproximately 100 black families who identify as Afrikaners live in the settlement of Onverwacht, established in 1886 near the mining town of Cullinan. Members of the community descend from the freed slaves who had accompanied Voortrekkers who settled in the area.\n\n\n== Modern history ==\n\n\n=== Apartheid era ===\n\nIn South Africa, an Afrikaner minority party, the National Party, came to power in 1948 and enacted a series of segregationist laws favouring White people known as apartheid, meaning \"separateness\". These laws allowed for the systematic persecution of opposition leaders and attempted to enforce general white supremacy by classifying all South African inhabitants into racial groups. Non-White political participation was outlawed, Black citizenship revoked, and the entire public sphere, including education, residential areas, medical care and common areas such as public transport, beaches and amenities, was segregated.\nApartheid was officially abolished in 1991 after decades of widespread unrest by opponents who were seeking equal rights, led by supporters of the United Democratic Front, Pan-African Congress, South African Communist Party, and African National Congress, and a long international embargo against South Africa. The effective end to apartheid, however, is widely regarded as the 1994 general election, the first fully democratic, multi-racial election.\nIt took place following a long series of negotiations involving the National Party government under President Frederik Willem de Klerk, the ANC under Nelson Mandela, and other parties. The African National Congress won and Mandela was elected as President.\n\n\n=== Post-apartheid era ===\n\nEfforts are being made by some Afrikaners to secure minority rights. Protection of minority rights is fundamental to the new 1996 post-apartheid Constitution of South Africa. These efforts include the Volkstaat movement. In contrast, a handful of Afrikaners have joined the ruling African National Congress party, which is overwhelmingly supported by South Africa's Black majority.\nTo right decades of discrimination, Employment Equity legislation favours employment of Black (African, Indian, Chinese and Coloured population groups, White women, disabled people) South Africans over White men. Black Economic Empowerment legislation further favours Blacks as the government considers ownership, employment, training and social responsibility initiatives which empower Black South Africans as important criteria when awarding tenders. However, private enterprise adheres to this legislation voluntarily. Some reports indicate a growing number of Whites living in poverty compared to the apartheid era, and attribute this change to such laws. In 2006 some 350,000 Afrikaners were classified as poor, with some research claiming that up to 150,000 were struggling to survive. This decline among them, combined with a wave of violent crime, has led to many Afrikaners and English-speaking South Africans leaving the country.\nIn the early 2000s, Genocide Watch theorised that farm attacks constituted early warning signs of genocide against Afrikaners. It criticised the South African government for its inaction on the issue, noting that, since 1991, \"ethno-European farmers\" (which included non-Afrikaner farmers of European race in their report) were being murdered at a rate four times higher than that of the general South African population. As of the 1996 census, 68,606 out of the 749,637 people in the agriculture and hunting sector were white. Since 1994, close to 3,000 farmers have been murdered in thousands of farm attacks.\n\n\n=== Afrikaner diaspora and emigration ===\n\nSince 1994, significant numbers of White people have emigrated from South Africa. Large Afrikaner and English-speaking South African communities have developed in the UK and other developed countries. Between 1995-2005, more than one million South Africans emigrated overseas, citing the high rate of violent and racially motivated Black on White crime as the main reason to leave. Farmers have also emigrated to other parts of Africa (e.g. North Eastern Congo) to develop efficient commercial farming there.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Namibia ===\nThere were 133,324 speakers of Afrikaans in Namibia, forming 9.5% of the total national population, according to the 1991 census. The majority identify with the Coloured and Baster communities of colour. Afrikaners are mostly found in Windhoek and in the Southern provinces; they have a population of around 100,000 in Namibia.\n\n\n=== Global presence ===\nA significant number of Afrikaners have migrated to Commonwealth nations such as Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. Other popular destinations include the Netherlands, United Arab Emirates, and Hong Kong. Some have also settled in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Qatar.\nNumerous young Afrikaners have taken advantage of working holiday visas made available by the United Kingdom, as well as the Netherlands and Belgium, to gain work experience. The scheme under which UK working holiday visas were issued ended on 27 November 2008; this was replaced by the Tier 5 (Youth Mobility) visa. South Africa has been excluded from the working holiday visa programme in the UK, Belgium, Netherlands, and the rest of the EU.\nAs of 2011, Georgia is encouraging Afrikaner immigration to assist in reviving the country's agriculture industry, which has fallen on hard times. In 2018, there were reports that Russia might welcome 15,000 Afrikaners to southern Russia.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nAt the time of settlement, Dutch traders and others came out of a majority- Protestant area, where the Reformation had resulted in high rates of literacy in the Netherlands. Boers in South Africa were part of the Calvinist tradition in the northern Europe Protestant countries. The original South African Boer republics were founded on the principles of the Dutch Reformed Church. Missionaries established new congregations on the frontier and churches were the center of communities.\nIn 1985, 92% of Afrikaners identified as members of the Reformed churches that developed from this background. Pentecostal churches have also attracted new members. In April 2017, some million people, mostly Afrikaners, were expected at a prayer gathering held by Angus Buchan in Bloemfontein.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nThe Afrikaans language changed over time from the Dutch spoken by the first white settlers at the Cape. From the late 17th century, the form of Dutch spoken at the Cape developed differences, mostly in morphology but also in pronunciation and accent and, to a lesser extent, in syntax and vocabulary, from that of the Netherlands, although the languages are still similar enough to be mutually intelligible. Settlers who arrived speaking German and French soon shifted to using Dutch and later Afrikaans. The process of language change was influenced by the languages spoken by slaves, Khoikhoi and people of mixed descent, as well as by Cape Malay, Zulu, British and Portuguese. While the Dutch of the Netherlands remained the official language, the new dialect, often known as Cape Dutch, African Dutch, \"kitchen Dutch\", or taal (meaning \"language\" in Afrikaans) developed into a separate language by the 19th century, with much work done by the Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners and other writers such as Cornelis Jacobus Langenhoven. In a 1925 act of Parliament, Afrikaans was given equal status with Dutch as one of the two official languages (English being the second) of the Union of South Africa. There was much objection to the attempt to legislate the creation of Afrikaans as a new language.  Marthinus Steyn, a prominent jurist and politician, and others were vocal in their opposition.  Today, Afrikaans is recognised as one of the eleven official languages of the new South Africa, and is the third largest mother tongue spoken in South Africa. In June 2013, the Department of Basic Education included Afrikaans as an African language to be compulsory for all pupils, according to a new policy.\nAfrikaans is offered at many universities outside of South Africa including in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Poland, Russia and the United States.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nAfrikaners have a long literary tradition, and have produced a number of notable novelists and poets, including Eugene Marais, Uys Krige, Elisabeth Eybers, Breyten Breytenbach, Andr\u00e9 Brink, C. J. Langenhoven and Etienne Leroux.\nNobel Prize winner J.M. Coetzee is of Afrikaner descent, but spoke English at home as a child in Cape Town. He has translated some works from Afrikaans and Dutch into English, but writes only in English.\n\n\n=== Arts ===\n\nMusic is probably the most popular art form among Afrikaners. While the traditional Boeremusiek (\"Boer music\") and Volkspele (\"people games\") folk dancing enjoyed popularity in the past, most Afrikaners today favour a variety of international genres and light popular Afrikaans music. American country and western music has enjoyed great popularity and has a strong following among many South Africans. Some also enjoy a social dance event called a sokkie. The South African rock band Seether has a hidden track on their album Karma and Effect titled Kom Saam Met My (\"Come With Me\"), sung in Afrikaans. There is also an underground rock music movement and bands like the controversial Fokofpolisiekar have a large following. The television Channel MK (channel) also supports local Afrikaans music and mainly screens videos from the Afrikaans Rock genre. Afrikaner classical musicians include the pianists Wessel van Wyk, Ben Schoeman, and Petronel Malan, and the music departments of the various universities (Pretoria, Stellenbosch, Potchefstroom, Free State) that started as Afrikaans universities still are renowned. In the 20th century, Mimi Coertse, an internationally renowned opera singer, was well known. She is also known as African Lieder interpreter by Stephanus Le Roux Marais. The world-renowned UNISA music exams include a section of South African contemporary music, which acknowledges Afrikaner composers. The contemporary musical Ons vir jou, dealing with the Second Boer War, featured a book by Deon Opperman and a score by Sean Else and Johan Vorster of the band Eden. Afrikaner film musicals flourished in the 1950s and 1960s, and have returned in the 21st century with two popular films, Liefling and Pretville, featuring singers such as Bobby van Jaarsveld, Steve Hofmeyr, and Kevin Leo.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nAfrikaner cuisine has contributed three unique terms to the South African lexicon, namely boerekos, potjiekos and braaivleis, although the latter (meaning \u201cgrilled meat\u201d) has actually expanded to a common South African habit.\nA typical recipe for boerekos consists of meat (usually roasted in a pan or oven), vegetables such as green beans, roots or peas, and starch such as potatoes or rice, with sauce made in the pot in which the meat is cooked. The dish can also use pumpkins or sweet potatoes, and some of the ingredients may be further processed into pampoenkoekies (\u201cpumpkin biscuits,\u201d pumpkin baked in a kind of puff) or plaasboontjies (\"Farm beans\") consisting of green beans cooked and crushed with potatoes and onions. Afrikaners eat most types of meat such as mutton, beef, chicken, pork and various game species, but the meat of draft animals such as horses and donkeys is rarely eaten and is not part of traditional cuisine.\nEast Indian influence emerges in dishes such as bobotie and curry and the use of turmeric and other spices in cooking. Afrikaner households like to eat combinations such as pap-and-sausage, curry (meat) and rice and even fish and chips (although the latter are bought rather than self-prepared). Afrikaners also love biltong, dro\u00ebwors, koeksisters, melktert, and a variety of traditionally homemade but increasingly storebought pastries.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\nRugby, cricket and golf are generally considered to be the most popular sports among Afrikaners. Rugby in particular is considered one of the central pillars of the Afrikaner community. The national rugby team, the Springboks, did not compete in the first two rugby world cups in 1987 and 1991 because of anti-apartheid sporting boycotts of South Africa but later on the Springboks won the 1995, 2007, and 2019 Rugby World Cups.\nBoere-sport also played a big role in the Afrikaner history. It consisted of a variety of sports like tug of war, three-legged races, jukskei, skilpadloop (tortoise walk) and other games.\n\n\n=== Numismatics ===\nThe world's first ounce-denominated gold coin, the Krugerrand, was struck at the South African Mint on 3 July 1967. The name Krugerrand was derived from Kruger (after President Paul Kruger) and the rand monetary unit of South Africa.\nIn April 2007, the South African Mint coined a collectors R1 gold coin commemorating the Afrikaner people as part of its cultural series, depicting the Great Trek across the Drakensberg mountains.\n\n\n== Institutions ==\n\n\n=== Cultural ===\nThe Afrikaanse Taal en Kultuurvereniging (ATKV) (\"Afrikaans Language and Culture Association\") is responsible for promoting the Afrikaans language and culture.\nDie Voortrekkers is a youth movement for Afrikaners in South Africa and Namibia with a membership of over 10 000 active members to promote cultural values, maintaining norms and standards as Christians, and being accountable members of public society.\n\n\n=== Political ===\nThe vast majority of Afrikaners supported the Democratic Alliance (DA), the official opposition party, in the 2014 general election. The Democratic Alliance is a Liberal Party and a full member of Liberal International.\nSmaller numbers are involved in nationalist or separatist political organisations. The Freedom Front Plus (FF+) is an Afrikaner ethnic political party which lobbies for minority rights to be extended to Afrikaners. The Freedom Front Plus is also leading the Volkstaat initiative and is closely associated with the small town of Orania. Then-Freedom Front Plus leader Dr Pieter Mulder served as Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in the Cabinet of President Jacob Zuma from 2009 to 2014.\nVery few Afrikaans-speaking white South Africans vote for the ruling ANC. Some prominent Afrikaner ANC politicians include Derek Hanekom, Marthinus van Schalkwyk, Andries Nel, Gert Oosthuizen and Carl Niehaus.In an online poll of the Beeld newspaper during November 2012, in which nearly 11,000 Afrikaners participated, 42% described themselves as conservative and 36% as liberal. Social attitudes have become increasingly liberal since the end of apartheid in the 1990s, and in a 2015 poll 57% of Afrikaners claimed to oppose abortion on demand while 46% claimed to be opposed to homosexuality.In the 2019 general elections, the FF+'s support surged in former strongholds of the DA. Senior FF+ member Philip van Staden said that his party had grown significantly in the election due to the DA leader Mmusi Maimane's positions on race and ethnic identity resulting in the estrangement of many Afrikaans-speaking white voters. The party has since gone on to win previous DA wards with concentrated Afrikaner populations.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAfrikaner Calvinism\nAfrikaner nationalism\nAfrikaner-Jews\nBoer\nCape Coloureds\nCape Dutch\nCape Malays\nEthnic groups in Africa\nHuguenots in South Africa\nSouth African-American\nWhite South Africans\nWhite Africans of European ancestry\nVolkstaat\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBotha, Anton I (11 March 2011). \"Ek is 'n Boer\u2026or am I?\".

        "wiki": "Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (; Xhosa: [xol\u00ed\u026ca\u026ca mand\u025b\u0302\u02d0la]; 18 July 1918 \u2013 5 December 2013) was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader and philanthropist who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, he served as the president of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.\nA Xhosa speaker, Mandela was born to the Thembu royal family in Mvezo, Union of South Africa. He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in Johannesburg. There he became involved in anti-colonial and African nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding its Youth League in 1944. After the National Party's white-only government established apartheid, a system of racial segregation that privileged whites, he and the ANC committed themselves to its overthrow. Mandela was appointed President of the ANC's Transvaal branch, rising to prominence for his involvement in the 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the People. He was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956 Treason Trial. Influenced by Marxism, he secretly joined the banned South African Communist Party (SACP). Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the SACP he co-founded the militant Umkhonto we Sizwe in 1961 and led a sabotage campaign against the government. He was arrested and imprisoned in 1962, and subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the state following the Rivonia Trial.\nMandela served 27 years in prison, split between Robben Island, Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison. Amid growing domestic and international pressure, and with fears of a racial civil war, President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk led efforts to negotiate an end to apartheid, which resulted in the 1994 multiracial general election in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became president. Leading a broad coalition government which promulgated a new constitution, Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses. Economically, Mandela's administration retained its predecessor's liberal framework despite his own socialist beliefs, also introducing measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty and expand healthcare services. Internationally, he acted as mediator in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999. He declined a second presidential term and was succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki. Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson Mandela Foundation.\nMandela was a controversial figure for much of his life. Although critics on the right denounced him as a communist terrorist and those on the far-left deemed him too eager to negotiate and reconcile with apartheid's supporters, he gained international acclaim for his activism. Widely regarded as an icon of democracy and social justice, he received more than 250 honours, including the Nobel Peace Prize. He is held in deep respect within South Africa, where he is often referred to by his Thembu clan name, Madiba, and described as the \"Father of the Nation\".\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\n\n=== Childhood: 1918\u20131934 ===\nMandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the village of Mvezo in Umtata, then part of South Africa's Cape Province. Given the forename Rolihlahla, a Xhosa term colloquially meaning \"troublemaker\", in later years he became known by his clan name, Madiba. His patrilineal great-grandfather, Ngubengcuka, was king of the Thembu people in the Transkeian Territories of South Africa's modern Eastern Cape province. One of Ngubengcuka's sons, named Mandela, was Nelson's grandfather and the source of his surname. Because Mandela was the king's child by a wife of the Ixhiba clan, a so-called \"Left-Hand House\", the descendants of his cadet branch of the royal family were morganatic, ineligible to inherit the throne but recognised as hereditary royal councillors.Nelson Mandela's father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa Mandela (1880\u20131928), was a local chief and councillor to the monarch; he was appointed to the position in 1915, after his predecessor was accused of corruption by a governing white magistrate. In 1926, Gadla was also sacked for corruption, but Nelson was told that his father had lost his job for standing up to the magistrate's unreasonable demands. A devotee of the god Qamata, Gadla was a polygamist with four wives, four sons and nine daughters, who lived in different villages. Nelson's mother was Gadla's third wife, Nosekeni Fanny, daughter of Nkedama of the Right Hand House and a member of the amaMpemvu clan of the Thembu kingdom.\n\nMandela later stated that his early life was dominated by traditional Thembu custom and taboo. He grew up with two sisters in his mother's kraal in the village of Qunu, where he tended herds as a cattle-boy and spent much time outside with other boys. Both his parents were illiterate, but being a devout Christian, his mother sent him to a local Methodist school when he was about seven. Baptised a Methodist, Mandela was given the English forename of \"Nelson\" by his teacher. When Mandela was about nine, his father came to stay at Qunu, where he died of an undiagnosed ailment which Mandela believed to be lung disease. Feeling \"cut adrift\", he later said that he inherited his father's \"proud rebelliousness\" and \"stubborn sense of fairness\".Mandela's mother took him to the \"Great Place\" palace at Mqhekezweni, where he was entrusted to the guardianship of the Thembu regent, Chief Jongintaba Dalindyebo. Although he did not see his mother again for many years, Mandela felt that Jongintaba and his wife Noengland treated him as their own child, raising him alongside their son, Justice, and daughter, Nomafu. As Mandela attended church services every Sunday with his guardians, Christianity became a significant part of his life. He attended a Methodist mission school located next to the palace, where he studied English, Xhosa, history and geography. He developed a love of African history, listening to the tales told by elderly visitors to the palace, and was influenced by the anti-imperialist rhetoric of a visiting chief, Joyi. At the time he nevertheless considered the European colonialists not as oppressors but as benefactors who had brought education and other benefits to southern Africa. Aged 16, he, Justice and several other boys travelled to Tyhalarha to undergo the ulwaluko circumcision ritual that symbolically marked their transition from boys to men; afterwards he was given the name Dalibunga.\n\n\n=== Clarkebury, Healdtown, and Fort Hare: 1934\u20131940 ===\n\nIntending to gain skills needed to become a privy councillor for the Thembu royal house, in 1933 Mandela began his secondary education at Clarkebury Methodist High School in Engcobo, a Western-style institution that was the largest school for black Africans in Thembuland. Made to socialise with other students on an equal basis, he claimed that he lost his \"stuck up\" attitude, becoming best friends with a girl for the first time; he began playing sports and developed his lifelong love of gardening. He completed his Junior Certificate in two years, and in 1937 moved to Healdtown, the Methodist college in Fort Beaufort attended by most Thembu royalty, including Justice. The headmaster emphasised the superiority of English culture and government, but Mandela became increasingly interested in native African culture, making his first non-Xhosa-speaking friend, Zachariah Molete, a speaker of Sotho, and coming under the influence of one of his favourite teachers, Frank Lebentlele a teacher of Zoology and a Mosotho who broke taboo by marrying a Xhosa-speaker from uMtata. Mandela spent much of his spare time at Healdtown as a long-distance runner and boxer, and in his second year he became a prefect.With Jongintaba's backing, in 1939 Mandela began work on a BA degree at the University of Fort Hare, an elite black institution in Alice, Eastern Cape, with around 150 students. There he studied English, anthropology, politics, native administration, and Roman Dutch law in his first year, desiring to become an interpreter or clerk in the Native Affairs Department. Mandela stayed in the Wesley House dormitory, befriending his own kinsman, K. D. Matanzima, as well as Oliver Tambo, who became a close friend and comrade for decades to come. He took up ballroom dancing, performed in a drama society play about Abraham Lincoln, and gave Bible classes in the local community as part of the Student Christian Association. Although he had friends connected to the African National Congress (ANC) who wanted South Africa to be independent of the British Empire, Mandela avoided any involvement with the anti-imperialist movement, and became a vocal supporter of the British war effort when the Second World War broke out. He helped to found a first-year students' house committee which challenged the dominance of the second-years, and at the end of his first year became involved in a Students' Representative Council (SRC) boycott against the quality of food, for which he was suspended from the university; he never returned to complete his degree.\n\n\n=== Arriving in Johannesburg: 1941\u20131943 ===\nReturning to Mqhekezweni in December 1940, Mandela found that Jongintaba had arranged marriages for him and Justice; dismayed, they fled to Johannesburg via Queenstown, arriving in April 1941. Mandela found work as a night watchman at Crown Mines, his \"first sight of South African capitalism in action\", but was fired when the induna (headman) discovered that he was a runaway. He stayed with a cousin in George Goch Township, who introduced Mandela to realtor and ANC activist Walter Sisulu. The latter secured Mandela a job as an articled clerk at the law firm of Witkin, Sidelsky and Eidelman, a company run by Lazar Sidelsky, a liberal Jew sympathetic to the ANC's cause. At the firm, Mandela befriended Gaur Radebe\u2014 a Xhosa-speaking Hlubi member of the ANC and Communist Party\u2014and Nat Bregman, a Jewish communist who became his first white friend. Mandela attended Communist Party gatherings, where he was impressed that Europeans, Africans, Indians, and Coloureds mixed as equals. He later stated that he did not join the Party because its atheism conflicted with his Christian faith, and because he saw the South African struggle as being racially based rather than as class warfare. To continue his higher education, Mandela signed up to a University of South Africa correspondence course, working on his bachelor's degree at night.Earning a small wage, Mandela rented a room in the house of the Xhoma family in the Alexandra township; despite being rife with poverty, crime and pollution, Alexandra always remained a special place for him. Although embarrassed by his poverty, he briefly dated a Swazi woman before unsuccessfully courting his landlord's daughter. To save money and be closer to downtown Johannesburg, Mandela moved into the compound of the Witwatersrand Native Labour Association, living among miners of various tribes; as the compound was visited by various chiefs, he once met the Queen Regent of Basutoland. In late 1941, Jongintaba visited Johannesburg\u2014there forgiving Mandela for running away\u2014before returning to Thembuland, where he died in the winter of 1942. Mandela and Justice arrived a day late for the funeral. After he passed his BA exams in early 1943, Mandela returned to Johannesburg to follow a political path as a lawyer rather than become a privy councillor in Thembuland. He later stated that he experienced no epiphany, but that he \"simply found [himself] doing so, and could not do otherwise.\"\n\n\n== Revolutionary activity ==\n\n\n=== Law studies and the ANC Youth League: 1943\u20131949 ===\nMandela began studying law at the University of the Witwatersrand, where he was the only black African student and faced racism. There, he befriended liberal and communist European, Jewish, and Indian students, among them Joe Slovo and Ruth First. Becoming increasingly politicised, in August 1943 Mandela marched in support of a successful bus boycott to reverse fare rises. Joining the ANC, he was increasingly influenced by Sisulu, spending time with other activists at Sisulu's Orlando house, including his old friend Oliver Tambo. In 1943, Mandela met Anton Lembede, an ANC member affiliated with the \"Africanist\" branch of African nationalism, which was virulently opposed to a racially united front against colonialism and imperialism or to an alliance with the communists. Despite his friendships with non-blacks and communists, Mandela embraced Lembede's views, believing that black Africans should be entirely independent in their struggle for political self-determination. Deciding on the need for a youth wing to mass-mobilise Africans in opposition to their subjugation, Mandela was among a delegation that approached ANC President Alfred Bitini Xuma on the subject at his home in Sophiatown; the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) was founded on Easter Sunday 1944 in the Bantu Men's Social Centre, with Lembede as President and Mandela as a member of its executive committee.\n\nAt Sisulu's house, Mandela met Evelyn Mase, a trainee nurse and ANC activist from Engcobo, Transkei. Entering a relationship and marrying in October 1944, they initially lived with her relatives until moving into a rented house in the township of Orlando in early 1946. Their first child, Madiba \"Thembi\" Thembekile, was born in February 1945; a daughter, Makaziwe, was born in 1947 but died of meningitis nine months later. Mandela enjoyed home life, welcoming his mother and his sister, Leabie, to stay with him. In early 1947, his three years of articles ended at Witkin, Sidelsky and Eidelman, and he decided to become a full-time student, subsisting on loans from the Bantu Welfare Trust.In July 1947, Mandela rushed Lembede, who was ill, to hospital, where he died; he was succeeded as ANCYL president by the more moderate Peter Mda, who agreed to co-operate with communists and non-blacks, appointing Mandela ANCYL secretary. Mandela disagreed with Mda's approach, and in December 1947 supported an unsuccessful measure to expel communists from the ANCYL, considering their ideology un-African. In 1947, Mandela was elected to the executive committee of the ANC's Transvaal Province branch, serving under regional president C. S. Ramohanoe. When Ramohanoe acted against the wishes of the committee by co-operating with Indians and communists, Mandela was one of those who forced his resignation.In the South African general election in 1948, in which only whites were permitted to vote, the Afrikaner-dominated Herenigde Nasionale Party under Daniel Fran\u00e7ois Malan took power, soon uniting with the Afrikaner Party to form the National Party. Openly racialist, the party codified and expanded racial segregation with new apartheid legislation. Gaining increasing influence in the ANC, Mandela and his party cadre allies began advocating direct action against apartheid, such as boycotts and strikes, influenced by the tactics already employed by South Africa's Indian community. Xuma did not support these measures and was removed from the presidency in a vote of no confidence, replaced by James Moroka and a more militant executive committee containing Sisulu, Mda, Tambo, and Godfrey Pitje. Mandela later related that he and his colleagues had \"guided the ANC to a more radical and revolutionary path.\" Having devoted his time to politics, Mandela failed his final year at Witwatersrand three times; he was ultimately denied his degree in December 1949.\n\n\n=== Defiance Campaign and Transvaal ANC Presidency: 1950\u20131954 ===\n\nMandela took Xuma's place on the ANC national executive in March 1950, and that same year was elected national president of the ANCYL. In March, the Defend Free Speech Convention was held in Johannesburg, bringing together African, Indian, and communist activists to call a May Day general strike in protest against apartheid and white minority rule. Mandela opposed the strike because it was multi-racial and not ANC-led, but a majority of black workers took part, resulting in increased police repression and the introduction of the Suppression of Communism Act, 1950, affecting the actions of all protest groups. At the ANC national conference of December 1951, he continued arguing against a racially united front, but was outvoted.Thereafter, Mandela rejected Lembede's Africanism and embraced the idea of a multi-racial front against apartheid. Influenced by friends like Moses Kotane and by the Soviet Union's support for wars of national liberation, his mistrust of communism broke down and he began reading literature by Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, and Mao Zedong, eventually embracing the Marxist philosophy of dialectical materialism. Commenting on communism, he later stated that he \"found [himself] strongly drawn to the idea of a classless society which, to [his] mind, was similar to traditional African culture where life was shared and communal.\" In April 1952, Mandela began work at the H.M. Basner law firm, which was owned by a communist, although his increasing commitment to work and activism meant he spent less time with his family.In 1952, the ANC began preparation for a joint Defiance Campaign against apartheid with Indian and communist groups, founding a National Voluntary Board to recruit volunteers. The campaign was designed to follow the path of nonviolent resistance influenced by Mahatma Gandhi; some supported this for ethical reasons, but Mandela instead considered it pragmatic. At a Durban rally on 22 June, Mandela addressed an assembled crowd of 10,000 people, initiating the campaign protests for which he was arrested and briefly interned in Marshall Square prison. These events established Mandela as one of the best-known black political figures in South Africa. With further protests, the ANC's membership grew from 20,000 to 100,000 members; the government responded with mass arrests and introduced the Public Safety Act, 1953 to permit martial law. In May, authorities banned Transvaal ANC President J. B. Marks from making public appearances; unable to maintain his position, he recommended Mandela as his successor. Although Africanists opposed his candidacy, Mandela was elected to be regional president in October.\n\nIn July 1952, Mandela was arrested under the Suppression of Communism Act and stood trial as one of the 21 accused\u2014among them Moroka, Sisulu, and Yusuf Dadoo\u2014in Johannesburg. Found guilty of \"statutory communism\", a term that the government used to describe most opposition to apartheid, their sentence of nine months' hard labour was suspended for two years. In December, Mandela was given a six-month ban from attending meetings or talking to more than one individual at a time, making his Transvaal ANC presidency impractical, and during this period the Defiance Campaign petered out. In September 1953, Andrew Kunene read out Mandela's \"No Easy Walk to Freedom\" speech at a Transvaal ANC meeting; the title was taken from a quote by Indian independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru, a seminal influence on Mandela's thought. The speech laid out a contingency plan for a scenario in which the ANC was banned. This Mandela Plan, or M-Plan, involved dividing the organisation into a cell structure with a more centralised leadership.Mandela obtained work as an attorney for the firm Terblanche and Briggish, before moving to the liberal-run Helman and Michel, passing qualification exams to become a full-fledged attorney. In August 1953, Mandela and Tambo opened their own law firm, Mandela and Tambo, operating in downtown Johannesburg. The only African-run law firm in the country, it was popular with aggrieved blacks, often dealing with cases of police brutality. Disliked by the authorities, the firm was forced to relocate to a remote location after their office permit was removed under the Group Areas Act; as a result, their clientele dwindled. As a lawyer of aristocratic heritage, Mandela was part of Johannesburg's elite black middle-class, and accorded much respect from the black community. Although a second daughter, Makaziwe Phumia, was born in May 1954, Mandela's relationship with Evelyn became strained, and she accused him of adultery. He may have had affairs with ANC member Lillian Ngoyi and secretary Ruth Mompati; various individuals close to Mandela in this period have stated that the latter bore him a child. Disgusted by her son's behaviour, Nosekeni returned to Transkei, while Evelyn embraced the Jehovah's Witnesses and rejected Mandela's preoccupation with politics.\n\n\n=== Congress of the People and the Treason Trial: 1955\u20131961 ===\n\nAfter taking part in the unsuccessful protest to prevent the forced relocation of all black people from the Sophiatown suburb of Johannesburg in February 1955, Mandela concluded that violent action would prove necessary to end apartheid and white minority rule. On his advice, Sisulu requested weaponry from the People's Republic of China, which was denied. Although the Chinese government supported the anti-apartheid struggle, they believed the movement insufficiently prepared for guerrilla warfare. With the involvement of the South African Indian Congress, the Coloured People's Congress, the South African Congress of Trade Unions and the Congress of Democrats, the ANC planned a Congress of the People, calling on all South Africans to send in proposals for a post-apartheid era. Based on the responses, a Freedom Charter was drafted by Rusty Bernstein, calling for the creation of a democratic, non-racialist state with the nationalisation of major industry. The charter was adopted at a June 1955 conference in Kliptown; 3,000 delegates attended the event, which was forcibly closed down by police. The tenets of the Freedom Charter remained important for Mandela, and in 1956 he described it as \"an inspiration to the people of South Africa\".Following the end of a second ban in September 1955, Mandela went on a working holiday to Transkei to discuss the implications of the Bantu Authorities Act, 1951 with local tribal leaders, also visiting his mother and Noengland before proceeding to Cape Town. In March 1956 he received his third ban on public appearances, restricting him to Johannesburg for five years, but he often defied it. Mandela's marriage broke down and Evelyn left him, taking their children to live with her brother. Initiating divorce proceedings in May 1956, she claimed that Mandela had physically abused her; he denied the allegations, and fought for custody of their children. She withdrew her petition of separation in November, but Mandela filed for divorce in January 1958; the divorce was finalised in March, with the children placed in Evelyn's care. During the divorce proceedings, he began courting a social worker, Winnie Madikizela, whom he married in Bizana in June 1958. She later became involved in ANC activities, spending several weeks in prison. Together they had two children: Zenani, born in February 1959, and Zindziswa (1960-2020).\n\nIn December 1956, Mandela was arrested alongside most of the ANC national executive, and accused of \"high treason\" against the state. Held in Johannesburg Prison amid mass protests, they underwent a preparatory examination before being granted bail. The defence's refutation began in January 1957, overseen by defence lawyer Vernon Berrang\u00e9, and continued until the case was adjourned in September. In January 1958, Oswald Pirow was appointed to prosecute the case, and in February the judge ruled that there was \"sufficient reason\" for the defendants to go on trial in the Transvaal Supreme Court. The formal Treason Trial began in Pretoria in August 1958, with the defendants successfully applying to have the three judges\u2014all linked to the governing National Party\u2014replaced. In August, one charge was dropped, and in October the prosecution withdrew its indictment, submitting a reformulated version in November which argued that the ANC leadership committed high treason by advocating violent revolution, a charge the defendants denied.In April 1959, Africanists dissatisfied with the ANC's united front approach founded the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC); Mandela disagreed with the PAC's racially exclusionary views, describing them as \"immature\" and \"na\u00efve\". Both parties took part in an anti-pass campaign in early 1960, in which Africans burned the passes that they were legally obliged to carry. One of the PAC-organised demonstrations was fired upon by police, resulting in the deaths of 69 protesters in the Sharpeville massacre. The incident brought international condemnation of the government and resulted in rioting throughout South Africa, with Mandela publicly burning his pass in solidarity.Responding to the unrest, the government implemented state of emergency measures, declaring martial law and banning the ANC and PAC; in March, they arrested Mandela and other activists, imprisoning them for five months without charge in the unsanitary conditions of the Pretoria Local prison. Imprisonment caused problems for Mandela and his co-defendants in the Treason Trial; their lawyers could not reach them, and so it was decided that the lawyers would withdraw in protest until the accused were freed from prison when the state of emergency was lifted in late August 1960. Over the following months, Mandela used his free time to organise an All-In African Conference near Pietermaritzburg, Natal, in March 1961, at which 1,400 anti-apartheid delegates met, agreeing on a stay-at-home strike to mark 31 May, the day South Africa became a republic. On 29 March 1961, six years after the Treason Trial began, the judges produced a verdict of not guilty, ruling that there was insufficient evidence to convict the accused of \"high treason\", since they had advocated neither communism nor violent revolution; the outcome embarrassed the government.\n\n\n=== MK, the SACP, and African tour: 1961\u201362 ===\n\nDisguised as a chauffeur, Mandela travelled around the country incognito, organising the ANC's new cell structure and the planned mass stay-at-home strike. Referred to as the \"Black Pimpernel\" in the press\u2014a reference to Emma Orczy's 1905 novel The Scarlet Pimpernel\u2014a warrant for his arrest was put out by the police. Mandela held secret meetings with reporters, and after the government failed to prevent the strike, he warned them that many anti-apartheid activists would soon resort to violence through groups like the PAC's Poqo. He believed that the ANC should form an armed group to channel some of this violence in a controlled direction, convincing both ANC leader Albert Luthuli\u2014who was morally opposed to violence\u2014and allied activist groups of its necessity.Inspired by the actions of Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement in the Cuban Revolution, in 1961 Mandela, Sisulu, and Slovo co-founded Umkhonto we Sizwe (\"Spear of the Nation\", abbreviated MK). Becoming chairman of the militant group, Mandela gained ideas from literature on guerrilla warfare by Marxist militants Mao and Che Guevara as well as from the military theorist Carl von Clausewitz. Although initially declared officially separate from the ANC so as not to taint the latter's reputation, MK was later widely recognised as the party's armed wing. Most early MK members were white communists who were able to conceal Mandela in their homes; after hiding in communist Wolfie Kodesh's flat in Berea, Mandela moved to the communist-owned Liliesleaf Farm in Rivonia, there joined by Raymond Mhlaba, Slovo, and Bernstein, who put together the MK constitution. Although in later life Mandela denied, for political reasons, ever being a member of the Communist Party, historical research published in 2011 strongly suggested that he had joined in the late 1950s or early 1960s. This was confirmed by both the SACP and the ANC after Mandela's death. According to the SACP, he was not only a member of the party, but also served on its Central Committee.\n\nOperating through a cell structure, MK planned to carry out acts of sabotage that would exert maximum pressure on the government with minimum casualties; they sought to bomb military installations, power plants, telephone lines, and transport links at night, when civilians were not present. Mandela stated that they chose sabotage because it was the least harmful action, did not involve killing, and offered the best hope for racial reconciliation afterwards; he nevertheless acknowledged that should this have failed then guerrilla warfare might have been necessary. Soon after ANC leader Luthuli was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, MK publicly announced its existence with 57 bombings on Dingane's Day (16 December) 1961, followed by further attacks on New Year's Eve.The ANC decided to send Mandela as a delegate to the February 1962 meeting of the Pan-African Freedom Movement for East, Central and Southern Africa (PAFMECSA) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Leaving South Africa in secret via Bechuanaland, on his way Mandela visited Tanganyika and met with its president, Julius Nyerere. Arriving in Ethiopia, Mandela met with Emperor Haile Selassie I, and gave his speech after Selassie's at the conference. After the symposium, he travelled to Cairo, Egypt, admiring the political reforms of President Gamal Abdel Nasser, and then went to Tunis, Tunisia, where President Habib Bourguiba gave him \u00a35,000 for weaponry. He proceeded to Morocco, Mali, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Senegal, receiving funds from Liberian President William Tubman and Guinean President Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9. He left Africa for London, England, where he met anti-apartheid activists, reporters, and prominent politicians. Upon returning to Ethiopia, he began a six-month course in guerrilla warfare, but completed only two months before being recalled to South Africa by the ANC's leadership.\n\n\n== Imprisonment ==\n\n\n=== Arrest and Rivonia trial: 1962\u20131964 ===\n\nOn 5 August 1962, police captured Mandela along with fellow activist Cecil Williams near Howick. Many MK members suspected that the authorities had been tipped off with regard to Mandela's whereabouts, although Mandela himself gave these ideas little credence. In later years, Donald Rickard, a former American diplomat revealed that the Central Intelligence Agency, who feared Mandela's associations with communists, had informed the South African police of his location. Jailed in Johannesburg's Marshall Square prison, Mandela was charged with inciting workers' strikes and leaving the country without permission. Representing himself with Slovo as legal advisor, Mandela intended to use the trial to showcase \"the ANC's moral opposition to racism\" while supporters demonstrated outside the court. Moved to Pretoria, where Winnie could visit him, he began correspondence studies for a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree from the University of London International Programmes. His hearing began in October, but he disrupted proceedings by wearing a traditional kaross, refusing to call any witnesses, and turning his plea of mitigation into a political speech. Found guilty, he was sentenced to five years' imprisonment; as he left the courtroom, supporters sang \"Nkosi Sikelel iAfrika\".\n\nOn 11 July 1963, police raided Liliesleaf Farm, arresting those they found there and uncovering paperwork documenting MK's activities, some of which mentioned Mandela. The Rivonia Trial began at Pretoria Supreme Court in October, with Mandela and his comrades charged with four counts of sabotage and conspiracy to violently overthrow the government; their chief prosecutor was Percy Yutar. Judge Quartus de Wet soon threw out the prosecution's case for insufficient evidence, but Yutar reformulated the charges, presenting his new case from December 1963 until February 1964, calling 173 witnesses and bringing thousands of documents and photographs to the trial.Although four of the accused denied involvement with MK, Mandela and the other five accused admitted sabotage but denied that they had ever agreed to initiate guerrilla war against the government. They used the trial to highlight their political cause; at the opening of the defence's proceedings, Mandela gave his three-hour \"I Am Prepared to Die\" speech. That speech\u2014which was inspired by Castro's \"History Will Absolve Me\"\u2014was widely reported in the press despite official censorship. The trial gained international attention; there were global calls for the release of the accused from the United Nations and World Peace Council, while the University of London Union voted Mandela to its presidency. On 12 June 1964, justice De Wet found Mandela and two of his co-accused guilty on all four charges; although the prosecution had called for the death sentence to be applied, the judge instead condemned them to life imprisonment.\n\n\n=== Robben Island: 1964\u20131982 ===\nIn 1964, Mandela and his co-accused were transferred from Pretoria to the prison on Robben Island, remaining there for the next 18 years. Isolated from non-political prisoners in Section B, Mandela was imprisoned in a damp concrete cell measuring 8 feet (2.4 m) by 7 feet (2.1 m), with a straw mat on which to sleep. Verbally and physically harassed by several white prison wardens, the Rivonia Trial prisoners spent their days breaking rocks into gravel, until being reassigned in January 1965 to work in a lime quarry. Mandela was initially forbidden to wear sunglasses, and the glare from the lime permanently damaged his eyesight. At night, he worked on his LLB degree which he was obtaining from the University of London through a correspondence course with Wolsey Hall, Oxford, but newspapers were forbidden, and he was locked in solitary confinement on several occasions for the possession of smuggled news clippings. He was initially classified as the lowest grade of prisoner, Class D, meaning that he was permitted one visit and one letter every six months, although all mail was heavily censored.\n\nThe political prisoners took part in work and hunger strikes\u2014the latter considered largely ineffective by Mandela\u2014to improve prison conditions, viewing this as a microcosm of the anti-apartheid struggle. ANC prisoners elected him to their four-man \"High Organ\" along with Sisulu, Govan Mbeki, and Raymond Mhlaba, and he involved himself in a group representing all political prisoners (including Eddie Daniels) on the island, Ulundi, through which he forged links with PAC and Yu Chi Chan Club members. Initiating the \"University of Robben Island\", whereby prisoners lectured on their own areas of expertise, he debated socio-political topics with his comrades.Though attending Christian Sunday services, Mandela studied Islam. He also studied Afrikaans, hoping to build a mutual respect with the warders and convert them to his cause. Various official visitors met with Mandela, most significantly the liberal parliamentary representative Helen Suzman of the Progressive Party, who championed Mandela's cause outside of prison. In September 1970, he met British Labour Party politician Dennis Healey. South African Minister of Justice Jimmy Kruger visited in December 1974, but he and Mandela did not get along with each other. His mother visited in 1968, dying shortly after, and his firstborn son Thembi died in a car accident the following year; Mandela was forbidden from attending either funeral. His wife was rarely able to see him, being regularly imprisoned for political activity, and his daughters first visited in December 1975. Winnie was released from prison in 1977 but was forcibly settled in Brandfort and remained unable to see him.From 1967 onwards, prison conditions improved; black prisoners were given trousers rather than shorts, games were permitted, and the standard of their food was raised. In 1969, an escape plan for Mandela was developed by Gordon Bruce, but it was abandoned after the conspiracy was infiltrated by an agent of the South African Bureau of State Security (BOSS), who hoped to see Mandela shot during the escape. In 1970, Commander Piet Badenhorst became commanding officer. Mandela, seeing an increase in the physical and mental abuse of prisoners, complained to visiting judges, who had Badenhorst reassigned. He was replaced by Commander Willie Willemse, who developed a co-operative relationship with Mandela and was keen to improve prison standards.\n\nBy 1975, Mandela had become a Class A prisoner, which allowed him greater numbers of visits and letters. He corresponded with anti-apartheid activists like Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Desmond Tutu. That year, he began his autobiography, which was smuggled to London, but remained unpublished at the time; prison authorities discovered several pages, and his LLB study privileges were revoked for four years. Instead, he devoted his spare time to gardening and reading until the authorities permitted him to resume his LLB degree studies in 1980.By the late 1960s, Mandela's fame had been eclipsed by Steve Biko and the Black Consciousness Movement (BCM). Seeing the ANC as ineffectual, the BCM called for militant action, but following the Soweto uprising of 1976, many BCM activists were imprisoned on Robben Island. Mandela tried to build a relationship with these young radicals, although he was critical of their racialism and contempt for white anti-apartheid activists. Renewed international interest in his plight came in July 1978, when he celebrated his 60th birthday. He was awarded an honorary doctorate in Lesotho, the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding in India in 1979, and the Freedom of the City of Glasgow, Scotland in 1981. In March 1980, the slogan \"Free Mandela!\" was developed by journalist Percy Qoboza, sparking an international campaign that led the UN Security Council to call for his release. Despite increasing foreign pressure, the government refused, relying on its Cold War allies US President Ronald Reagan and UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher; both considered Mandela's ANC a terrorist organisation sympathetic to communism, and supported its suppression.\n\n\n=== Pollsmoor Prison: 1982\u20131988 ===\nIn April 1982, Mandela was transferred to Pollsmoor Prison in Tokai, Cape Town, along with senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, Ahmed Kathrada, and Raymond Mhlaba; they believed that they were being isolated to remove their influence on younger activists at Robben Island. Conditions at Pollsmoor were better than at Robben Island, although Mandela missed the camaraderie and scenery of the island. Getting on well with Pollsmoor's commanding officer, Brigadier Munro, Mandela was permitted to create a roof garden; he also read voraciously and corresponded widely, now permitted 52 letters a year. He was appointed patron of the multi-racial United Democratic Front (UDF), founded to combat reforms implemented by South African President P. W. Botha. Botha's National Party government had permitted Coloured and Indian citizens to vote for their own parliaments, which had control over education, health, and housing, but black Africans were excluded from the system; like Mandela, the UDF saw this as an attempt to divide the anti-apartheid movement on racial lines.\n\nThe early 1980s witnessed an escalation of violence across the country, and many predicted civil war. This was accompanied by economic stagnation as various multinational banks\u2014under pressure from an international lobby\u2014had stopped investing in South Africa. Numerous banks and Thatcher asked Botha to release Mandela\u2014then at the height of his international fame\u2014to defuse the volatile situation. Although considering Mandela a dangerous \"arch-Marxist\", in February 1985 Botha offered him a release from prison if he \"unconditionally rejected violence as a political weapon\". Mandela spurned the offer, releasing a statement through his daughter Zindzi stating, \"What freedom am I being offered while the organisation of the people [ANC] remains banned? Only free men can negotiate. A prisoner cannot enter into contracts.\"In 1985, Mandela underwent surgery on an enlarged prostate gland, before being given new solitary quarters on the ground floor. He was met by \"seven eminent persons\", an international delegation sent to negotiate a settlement, but Botha's government refused to co-operate, calling a state of emergency in June and initiating a police crackdown on unrest. The anti-apartheid resistance fought back, with the ANC committing 231 attacks in 1986 and 235 in 1987. The violence escalated as the government used the army and police to combat the resistance, and provided covert support for vigilante groups and the Zulu nationalist movement Inkatha, which was involved in an increasingly violent struggle with the ANC. Mandela requested talks with Botha but was denied, instead secretly meeting with Minister of Justice Kobie Coetsee in 1987, and having a further 11 meetings over the next three years. Coetsee organised negotiations between Mandela and a team of four government figures starting in May 1988; the team agreed to the release of political prisoners and the legalisation of the ANC on the condition that they permanently renounce violence, break links with the Communist Party, and not insist on majority rule. Mandela rejected these conditions, insisting that the ANC would end its armed activities only when the government renounced violence.Mandela's 70th birthday in July 1988 attracted international attention, including a tribute concert at London's Wembley Stadium that was televised and watched by an estimated 200 million viewers. Although presented globally as a heroic figure, he faced personal problems when ANC leaders informed him that Winnie had set herself up as head of a gang, the \"Mandela United Football Club\", which had been responsible for torturing and killing opponents\u2014including children\u2014in Soweto. Though some encouraged him to divorce her, he decided to remain loyal until she was found guilty by trial.\n\n\n=== Victor Verster Prison and release: 1988\u20131990 ===\n\nRecovering from tuberculosis exacerbated by the damp conditions in his cell, in December 1988, Mandela was moved to Victor Verster Prison near Paarl. He was housed in the relative comfort of a warder's house with a personal cook, and he used the time to complete his LLB degree. While there, he was permitted many visitors and organised secret communications with exiled ANC leader Oliver Tambo.In 1989, Botha suffered a stroke; although he would retain the state presidency, he stepped down as leader of the National Party, to be replaced by F. W. de Klerk. In a surprise move, Botha invited Mandela to a meeting over tea in July 1989, an invitation Mandela considered genial. Botha was replaced as state president by de Klerk six weeks later; the new president believed that apartheid was unsustainable and released a number of ANC prisoners. Following the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, de Klerk called his cabinet together to debate legalising the ANC and freeing Mandela. Although some were deeply opposed to his plans, de Klerk met with Mandela in December to discuss the situation, a meeting both men considered friendly, before legalising all formerly banned political parties in February 1990 and announcing Mandela's unconditional release. Shortly thereafter, for the first time in 20 years, photographs of Mandela were allowed to be published in South Africa.Leaving Victor Verster Prison on 11 February, Mandela held Winnie's hand in front of amassed crowds and the press; the event was broadcast live across the world. Driven to Cape Town's City Hall through crowds, he gave a speech declaring his commitment to peace and reconciliation with the white minority, but he made it clear that the ANC's armed struggle was not over and would continue as \"a purely defensive action against the violence of apartheid\". He expressed hope that the government would agree to negotiations, so that \"there may no longer be the need for the armed struggle\", and insisted that his main focus was to bring peace to the black majority and give them the right to vote in national and local elections. Staying at Tutu's home, in the following days Mandela met with friends, activists, and press, giving a speech to an estimated 100,000 people at Johannesburg's FNB Stadium.\n\n\n== End of apartheid ==\n\n\n=== Early negotiations: 1990\u201391 ===\n\nMandela proceeded on an African tour, meeting supporters and politicians in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Libya and Algeria, and continuing to Sweden, where he was reunited with Tambo, and London, where he appeared at the Nelson Mandela: An International Tribute for a Free South Africa concert at Wembley Stadium. Encouraging foreign countries to support sanctions against the apartheid government, he met President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in France, Pope John Paul II in the Vatican, and Thatcher in the United Kingdom. In the United States, he met President George H.W. Bush, addressed both Houses of Congress and visited eight cities, being particularly popular among the African-American community. In Cuba, he became friends with President Castro, whom he had long admired. He met President R. Venkataraman in India, President Suharto in Indonesia, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in Malaysia, and Prime Minister Bob Hawke in Australia. He visited Japan, but not the Soviet Union, a longtime ANC supporter.In May 1990, Mandela led a multiracial ANC delegation into preliminary negotiations with a government delegation of 11 Afrikaner men. Mandela impressed them with his discussions of Afrikaner history, and the negotiations led to the Groot Schuur Minute, in which the government lifted the state of emergency. In August, Mandela\u2014recognising the ANC's severe military disadvantage\u2014offered a ceasefire, the Pretoria Minute, for which he was widely criticised by MK activists. He spent much time trying to unify and build the ANC, appearing at a Johannesburg conference in December attended by 1600 delegates, many of whom found him more moderate than expected. At the ANC's July 1991 national conference in Durban, Mandela admitted that the party had faults and announced his aim to build a \"strong and well-oiled task force\" for securing majority rule. At the conference, he was elected ANC President, replacing the ailing Tambo, and a 50-strong multiracial, mixed gendered national executive was elected.Mandela was given an office in the newly purchased ANC headquarters at Shell House, Johannesburg, and moved into Winnie's large Soweto home. Their marriage was increasingly strained as he learned of her affair with Dali Mpofu, but he supported her during her trial for kidnapping and assault. He gained funding for her defence from the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern Africa and from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, but in June 1991 she was found guilty and sentenced to six years in prison, reduced to two on appeal. On 13 April 1992, Mandela publicly announced his separation from Winnie. The ANC forced her to step down from the national executive for misappropriating ANC funds; Mandela moved into the mostly white Johannesburg suburb of Houghton. Mandela's prospects for a peaceful transition were further damaged by an increase in \"black-on-black\" violence, particularly between ANC and Inkatha supporters in KwaZulu-Natal, which resulted in thousands of deaths. Mandela met with Inkatha leader Buthelezi, but the ANC prevented further negotiations on the issue. Mandela argued that there was a \"third force\" within the state intelligence services fuelling the \"slaughter of the people\" and openly blamed de Klerk\u2014whom he increasingly distrusted\u2014for the Sebokeng massacre. In September 1991, a national peace conference was held in Johannesburg at which Mandela, Buthelezi and de Klerk signed a peace accord, though the violence continued.\n\n\n=== CODESA talks: 1991\u201392 ===\nThe Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) began in December 1991 at the Johannesburg World Trade Centre, attended by 228 delegates from 19 political parties. Although Cyril Ramaphosa led the ANC's delegation, Mandela remained a key figure, and after de Klerk used the closing speech to condemn the ANC's violence, he took to the stage to denounce de Klerk as the \"head of an illegitimate, discredited minority regime\". Dominated by the National Party and ANC, little negotiation was achieved. CODESA 2 was held in May 1992, at which de Klerk insisted that post-apartheid South Africa must use a federal system with a rotating presidency to ensure the protection of ethnic minorities; Mandela opposed this, demanding a unitary system governed by majority rule. Following the Boipatong massacre of ANC activists by government-aided Inkatha militants, Mandela called off the negotiations, before attending a meeting of the Organisation of African Unity in Senegal, at which he called for a special session of the UN Security Council and proposed that a UN peacekeeping force be stationed in South Africa to prevent \"state terrorism\". Calling for domestic mass action, in August the ANC organised the largest-ever strike in South African history, and supporters marched on Pretoria.\n\nFollowing the Bisho massacre, in which 28 ANC supporters and one soldier were shot dead by the Ciskei Defence Force during a protest march, Mandela realised that mass action was leading to further violence and resumed negotiations in September. He agreed to do so on the conditions that all political prisoners be released, that Zulu traditional weapons be banned, and that Zulu hostels would be fenced off, the latter two measures intended to prevent further Inkatha attacks; de Klerk reluctantly agreed. The negotiations agreed that a multiracial general election would be held, resulting in a five-year coalition government of national unity and a constitutional assembly that gave the National Party continuing influence. The ANC also conceded to safeguarding the jobs of white civil servants; such concessions brought fierce internal criticism. The duo agreed on an interim constitution based on a liberal democratic model, guaranteeing separation of powers, creating a constitutional court, and including a US-style bill of rights; it also divided the country into nine provinces, each with its own premier and civil service, a concession between de Klerk's desire for federalism and Mandela's for unitary government.The democratic process was threatened by the Concerned South Africans Group (COSAG), an alliance of black ethnic-secessionist groups like Inkatha and far-right Afrikaner parties; in June 1993, one of the latter\u2014the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB)\u2014attacked the Kempton Park World Trade Centre. Following the murder of ANC activist Chris Hani, Mandela made a publicised speech to calm rioting, soon after appearing at a mass funeral in Soweto for Tambo, who had died of a stroke. In July 1993, both Mandela and de Klerk visited the US, independently meeting President Bill Clinton and each receiving the Liberty Medal. Soon after, Mandela and de Klerk were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway. Influenced by Thabo Mbeki, Mandela began meeting with big business figures, and played down his support for nationalisation, fearing that he would scare away much-needed foreign investment. Although criticised by socialist ANC members, he had been encouraged to embrace private enterprise by members of the Chinese and Vietnamese Communist parties at the January 1992 World Economic Forum in Switzerland.\n\n\n=== General election: 1994 ===\n\nWith the election set for 27 April 1994, the ANC began campaigning, opening 100 election offices and orchestrating People's Forums across the country at which Mandela could appear, as a popular figure with great status among black South Africans. The ANC campaigned on a Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) to build a million houses in five years, introduce universal free education and extend access to water and electricity. The party's slogan was \"a better life for all\", although it was not explained how this development would be funded. With the exception of the Weekly Mail and the New Nation, South Africa's press opposed Mandela's election, fearing continued ethnic strife, instead supporting the National or Democratic Party. Mandela devoted much time to fundraising for the ANC, touring North America, Europe and Asia to meet wealthy donors, including former supporters of the apartheid regime. He also urged a reduction in the voting age from 18 to 14; rejected by the ANC, this policy became the subject of ridicule.Concerned that COSAG would undermine the election, particularly in the wake of the conflict in Bophuthatswana and the Shell House massacre\u2014incidents of violence involving the AWB and Inkatha, respectively\u2014Mandela met with Afrikaner politicians and generals, including P. W. Botha, Pik Botha and Constand Viljoen, persuading many to work within the democratic system. With de Klerk, he also convinced Inkatha's Buthelezi to enter the elections rather than launch a war of secession. As leaders of the two major parties, de Klerk and Mandela appeared on a televised debate; although de Klerk was widely considered the better speaker at the event, Mandela's offer to shake his hand surprised him, leading some commentators to deem it a victory for Mandela. The election went ahead with little violence, although an AWB cell killed 20 with car bombs. As widely expected, the ANC won a sweeping victory, taking 63% of the vote, just short of the two-thirds majority needed to unilaterally change the constitution. The ANC was also victorious in seven provinces, with Inkatha and the National Party each taking one. Mandela voted at the Ohlange High School in Durban, and though the ANC's victory assured his election as President, he publicly accepted that the election had been marred by instances of fraud and sabotage.\n\n\n== Presidency of South Africa: 1994\u20131999 ==\n\nThe newly elected National Assembly's first act was to formally elect Mandela as South Africa's first black chief executive. His inauguration took place in Pretoria on 10 May 1994, televised to a billion viewers globally. The event was attended by four thousand guests, including world leaders from a wide range of geographic and ideological backgrounds. Mandela headed a Government of National Unity dominated by the ANC\u2014which had no experience of governing by itself\u2014but containing representatives from the National Party and Inkatha.  Under the Interim Constitution, Inkatha and the National Party were entitled to seats in the government by virtue of winning at least 20 seats. In keeping with earlier agreements, both de Klerk and Thabo Mbeki were given the position of Deputy President. Although Mbeki had not been his first choice for the job, Mandela grew to rely heavily on him throughout his presidency, allowing him to shape policy details. Moving into the presidential office at Tuynhuys in Cape Town, Mandela allowed de Klerk to retain the presidential residence in the Groote Schuur estate, instead settling into the nearby Westbrooke manor, which he renamed \"Genadendal\", meaning \"Valley of Mercy\" in Afrikaans. Retaining his Houghton home, he also had a house built in his home village of Qunu, which he visited regularly, walking around the area, meeting with locals, and judging tribal disputes.Aged 76, he faced various ailments, and although exhibiting continued energy, he felt isolated and lonely. He often entertained celebrities, such as Michael Jackson, Whoopi Goldberg, and the Spice Girls, and befriended ultra-rich businessmen, like Harry Oppenheimer of Anglo-American. He also met with Queen Elizabeth II on her March 1995 state visit to South Africa, which earned him strong criticism from ANC anti-capitalists. Despite his opulent surroundings, Mandela lived simply, donating a third of his R 552,000 annual income to the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund, which he had founded in 1995. Although dismantling press censorship, speaking out in favour of freedom of the press, and befriending many journalists, Mandela was critical of much of the country's media, noting that it was overwhelmingly owned and run by middle-class whites and believing that it focused too heavily on scaremongering about crime.In December 1994, Mandela published Long Walk to Freedom, an autobiography based around a manuscript he had written in prison, augmented by interviews conducted with American journalist Richard Stengel. In late 1994, he attended the 49th conference of the ANC in Bloemfontein, at which a more militant national executive was elected, among them Winnie Mandela; although she expressed an interest in reconciling, Nelson initiated divorce proceedings in August 1995. By 1995, he had entered into a relationship with Gra\u00e7a Machel, a Mozambican political activist 27 years his junior who was the widow of former president Samora Machel. They had first met in July 1990 when she was still in mourning, but their friendship grew into a partnership, with Machel accompanying him on many of his foreign visits. She turned down Mandela's first marriage proposal, wanting to retain some independence and dividing her time between Mozambique and Johannesburg.\n\n\n=== National reconciliation ===\n\nPresiding over the transition from apartheid minority rule to a multicultural democracy, Mandela saw national reconciliation as the primary task of his presidency. Having seen other post-colonial African economies damaged by the departure of white elites, Mandela worked to reassure South Africa's white population that they were protected and represented in \"the Rainbow Nation\". Although his Government of National Unity would be dominated by the ANC, he attempted to create a broad coalition by appointing de Klerk as Deputy President and appointing other National Party officials as ministers for Agriculture, Environment, and Minerals and Energy, as well as naming Buthelezi as Minister for Home Affairs. The other cabinet positions were taken by ANC members, many of whom\u2014like Joe Modise, Alfred Nzo, Joe Slovo, Mac Maharaj and Dullah Omar\u2014had long been comrades of Mandela, although others, such as Tito Mboweni and Jeff Radebe, were far younger. Mandela's relationship with de Klerk was strained; Mandela thought that de Klerk was intentionally provocative, and de Klerk felt that he was being intentionally humiliated by the president. In January 1995, Mandela heavily chastised him for awarding amnesty to 3,500 police officers just before the election, and later criticised him for defending former Minister of Defence Magnus Malan when the latter was charged with murder.Mandela personally met with senior figures of the apartheid regime, including Hendrik Verwoerd's widow, Betsie Schoombie, and lawyer Percy Yutar, also laying a wreath by the statue of Afrikaner hero Daniel Theron. Emphasising personal forgiveness and reconciliation, he announced that \"courageous people do not fear forgiving, for the sake of peace.\" He encouraged black South Africans to get behind the previously hated national rugby team, the Springboks, as South Africa hosted the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Mandela wore a Springbok shirt at the final against New Zealand, and after the Springboks won the match, Mandela presented the trophy to captain Francois Pienaar, an Afrikaner. This was widely seen as a major step in the reconciliation of white and black South Africans; as de Klerk later put it, \"Mandela won the hearts of millions of white rugby fans.\" Mandela's efforts at reconciliation assuaged the fears of whites, but also drew criticism from more militant blacks. Among the latter was his estranged wife, Winnie, who accused the ANC of being more interested in appeasing the white community than in helping the black majority.Mandela oversaw the formation of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate crimes committed under apartheid by both the government and the ANC, appointing Tutu as its chair. To prevent the creation of martyrs, the Commission granted individual amnesties in exchange for testimony of crimes committed during the apartheid era. Dedicated in February 1996, it held two years of hearings detailing rapes, torture, bombings, and assassinations, before issuing its final report in October 1998. Both de Klerk and Mbeki appealed to have parts of the report suppressed, though only de Klerk's appeal was successful. Mandela praised the Commission's work, stating that it \"had helped us move away from the past to concentrate on the present and the future\".\n\n\n=== Domestic programmes ===\n\nMandela's administration inherited a country with a huge disparity in wealth and services between white and black communities. Of a population of 40 million, around 23 million lacked electricity or adequate sanitation, and 12 million lacked clean water supplies, with 2 million children not in school and a third of the population illiterate. There was 33% unemployment, and just under half of the population lived below the poverty line. Government financial reserves were nearly depleted, with a fifth of the national budget being spent on debt repayment, meaning that the extent of the promised Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) was scaled back, with none of the proposed nationalisation or job creation. In 1996, the RDP was replaced with a new policy, Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR), which maintained South Africa's mixed economy but placed an emphasis on economic growth through a framework of market economics and the encouragement of foreign investment; many in the ANC derided it as a neo-liberal policy that did not address social inequality, no matter how Mandela defended it. In adopting this approach, Mandela's government adhered to the \"Washington consensus\" advocated by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.\n\nUnder Mandela's presidency, welfare spending increased by 13% in 1996/97, 13% in 1997/98, and 7% in 1998/99. The government introduced parity in grants for communities, including disability grants, child maintenance grants, and old-age pensions, which had previously been set at different levels for South Africa's different racial groups. In 1994, free healthcare was introduced for children under six and pregnant women, a provision extended to all those using primary level public sector health care services in 1996. By the 1999 election, the ANC could boast that due to their policies, 3 million people were connected to telephone lines, 1.5 million children were brought into the education system, 500 clinics were upgraded or constructed, 2 million people were connected to the electricity grid, water access was extended to 3 million people, and 750,000 houses were constructed, housing nearly 3 million people.The Land Reform Act 3 of 1996 safeguarded the rights of labour tenants living on farms where they grew crops or grazed livestock. This legislation ensured that such tenants could not be evicted without a court order or if they were over the age of 65. Recognising that arms manufacturing was a key industry for the South African economy, Mandela endorsed the trade in weapons but brought in tighter regulations surrounding Armscor to ensure that South African weaponry was not sold to authoritarian regimes. Under Mandela's administration, tourism was increasingly promoted, becoming a major sector of the South African economy.Critics like Edwin Cameron accused Mandela's government of doing little to stem the HIV/AIDS pandemic in the country; by 1999, 10% of South Africa's population were HIV positive. Mandela later admitted that he had personally neglected the issue, in part due to public reticence in discussing issues surrounding sex in South Africa, and that he had instead left the issue for Mbeki to deal with. Mandela also received criticism for failing to sufficiently combat crime; South Africa had one of the world's highest crime rates, and the activities of international crime syndicates in the country grew significantly throughout the decade. Mandela's administration was also perceived as having failed to deal with the problem of corruption.Further problems were caused by the exodus of thousands of skilled white South Africans from the country, who were escaping the increasing crime rates, higher taxes, and the impact of positive discrimination toward blacks in employment. This exodus resulted in a brain drain, and Mandela criticised those who left. At the same time, South Africa experienced an influx of millions of illegal migrants from poorer parts of Africa; although public opinion toward these illegal immigrants was generally unfavourable, characterising them as disease-spreading criminals who were a drain on resources, Mandela called on South Africans to embrace them as \"brothers and sisters\".\n\n\n=== Foreign affairs ===\nMandela expressed the view that \"South Africa's future foreign relations [should] be based on our belief that human rights should be the core of international relations\". Following the South African example, Mandela encouraged other nations to resolve conflicts through diplomacy and reconciliation. In September 1998, Mandela was appointed Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement, who held their annual conference in Durban. He used the event to criticise the \"narrow, chauvinistic interests\" of the Israeli government in stalling negotiations to end the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict and urged India and Pakistan to negotiate to end the Kashmir conflict, for which he was criticised by both Israel and India. Inspired by the region's economic boom, Mandela sought greater economic relations with East Asia, in particular with Malaysia, although this was prevented by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. He extended diplomatic recognition to the People's Republic of China (PRC), who were growing as an economic force, and initially also to Taiwan, who were already longstanding investors in the South African economy. However, under pressure from the PRC, in November 1996 he cut recognition of Taiwan, and in May 1999 paid an official visit to Beijing.\n\nMandela attracted controversy for his close relationship with Indonesian president Suharto, whose regime was responsible for mass human rights abuses, although on a July 1997 visit to Indonesia he privately urged Suharto to withdraw from the occupation of East Timor. He also faced similar criticism from the West for his government's trade links to Syria, Cuba, and Libya, and for his personal friendships with Castro and Gaddafi. Castro visited in 1998 to widespread popular acclaim, and Mandela met Gaddafi in Libya to award him the Order of Good Hope. When Western governments and media criticised these visits, Mandela lambasted such criticism as having racist undertones, and stated that \"the enemies of countries in the West are not our enemies.\" Mandela hoped to resolve the long-running dispute between Libya and the US and Britain over bringing to trial the two Libyans, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah, who were indicted in November 1991 and accused of sabotaging Pan Am Flight 103. Mandela proposed that they be tried in a third country, which was agreed to by all parties; governed by Scots law, the trial was held at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands in April 1999, and found one of the two men guilty.Mandela echoed Mbeki's calls for an \"African Renaissance\", and was greatly concerned with issues on the continent. He took a soft diplomatic approach to removing Sani Abacha's military junta in Nigeria but later became a leading figure in calling for sanctions when Abacha's regime increased human rights violations. In 1996, he was appointed Chairman of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and initiated unsuccessful negotiations to end the First Congo War in Zaire. He also played a key role as a mediator in the ethnic conflict between Tutsi and Hutu political groups in the Burundian Civil War, helping to initiate a settlement which brought increased stability to the country but did not end the ethnic violence. In South Africa's first post-apartheid military operation, troops were ordered in September 1998 into Lesotho to protect the government of Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili after a disputed election prompted opposition uprisings. The action was not authorised by Mandela himself, who was out of the country at the time, but by Buthelezi, who was serving as acting president during Mandela's absence.\n\n\n=== Withdrawing from politics ===\n\nThe new Constitution of South Africa was agreed upon by parliament in May 1996, enshrining a series of institutions to place checks on political and administrative authority within a constitutional democracy. De Klerk opposed the implementation of this constitution, and that month he and the National Party withdrew from the coalition government in protest, claiming that the ANC were not treating them as equals. The ANC took over the cabinet positions formerly held by the Nationalists, with Mbeki becoming sole Deputy President. Inkatha remained part of the coalition, and when both Mandela and Mbeki were out of the country in September 1998, Buthelezi was appointed \"Acting President\", marking an improvement in his relationship with Mandela. Although Mandela had often governed decisively in his first two years as President, he had subsequently increasingly delegated duties to Mbeki, retaining only a close personal supervision of intelligence and security measures. During a 1997 visit to London, he said that \"the ruler of South Africa, the de facto ruler, is Thabo Mbeki\" and that he was \"shifting everything to him\".Mandela stepped down as ANC President at the party's December 1997 conference. He hoped that Ramaphosa would succeed him, believing Mbeki to be too inflexible and intolerant of criticism, but the ANC elected Mbeki regardless. Mandela and the Executive supported Jacob Zuma, a Zulu who had been imprisoned on Robben Island, as Mbeki's replacement for Deputy President. Zuma's candidacy was challenged by Winnie, whose populist rhetoric had gained her a strong following within the party, although Zuma defeated her in a landslide victory vote at the election.Mandela's relationship with Machel had intensified; in February 1998, he publicly stated that he was \"in love with a remarkable lady\", and under pressure from Tutu, who urged him to set an example for young people, he organised a wedding for his 80th birthday, in July that year. The following day, he held a grand party with many foreign dignitaries. Although the 1996 constitution allowed the president to serve two consecutive five-year terms, Mandela had never planned to stand for a second term in office. He gave his farewell speech to Parliament on 29 March 1999 when it adjourned prior to the 1999 general elections, after which he retired. Although opinion polls in South Africa showed wavering support for both the ANC and the government, Mandela himself remained highly popular, with 80% of South Africans polled in 1999 expressing satisfaction with his performance as president.\n\n\n== Retirement ==\n\n\n=== Continued activism and philanthropy: 1999\u20132004 ===\n\nRetiring in June 1999, Mandela aimed to lead a quiet family life, divided between Johannesburg and Qunu. Although he set about authoring a sequel to his first autobiography, to be titled The Presidential Years, it was abandoned before publication. Mandela found such seclusion difficult and reverted to a busy public life involving daily programme of tasks, meetings with world leaders and celebrities, and\u2014when in Johannesburg\u2014working with the Nelson Mandela Foundation, founded in 1999 to focus on rural development, school construction, and combating HIV/AIDS. Although he had been heavily criticised for failing to do enough to fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic during his presidency, he devoted much of his time to the issue following his retirement, describing it as \"a war\" that had killed more than \"all previous wars\"; affiliating himself with the Treatment Action Campaign, he urged Mbeki's government to ensure that HIV-positive South Africans had access to anti-retrovirals. Meanwhile, Mandela was successfully treated for prostate cancer in July 2001.In 2002, Mandela inaugurated the Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture, and in 2003 the Mandela Rhodes Foundation was created at Rhodes House, University of Oxford, to provide postgraduate scholarships to African students. These projects were followed by the Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory and the 46664 campaign against HIV/AIDS. He gave the closing address at the XIII International AIDS Conference in Durban in 2000, and in 2004, spoke at the XV International AIDS Conference in Bangkok, Thailand, calling for greater measures to tackle tuberculosis as well as HIV/AIDS. Mandela publicised AIDS as the cause of his son Makgatho's death in January 2005, to defy the stigma about discussing the disease.Publicly, Mandela became more vocal in criticising Western powers. He strongly opposed the 1999 NATO intervention in Kosovo and called it an attempt by the world's powerful nations to police the entire world. In 2003, he spoke out against the plans for the United States to launch a war in Iraq, describing it as \"a tragedy\" and lambasting US President George W. Bush and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair (whom he referred to as an \"American foreign minister\") for undermining the UN, saying, \"All that (Mr. Bush) wants is Iraqi oil\". He attacked the US more generally, asserting that \"If there is a country that has committed unspeakable atrocities in the world, it is the United States of America\", citing the atomic bombing of Japan; this attracted international controversy, although he later improved his relationship with Bush. Retaining an interest in the Lockerbie suspect, he visited Megrahi in Barlinnie prison and spoke out against the conditions of his treatment, referring to them as \"psychological persecution\".\n\n\n=== \"Retiring from retirement\": 2004\u20132013 ===\n\nIn June 2004, aged 85 and amid failing health, Mandela announced that he was \"retiring from retirement\" and retreating from public life, remarking, \"Don't call me, I will call you.\" Although continuing to meet with close friends and family, the Foundation discouraged invitations for him to appear at public events and denied most interview requests.\n\nHe retained some involvement in international affairs. In 2005, he founded the Nelson Mandela Legacy Trust, travelling to the US to speak before the Brookings Institution and the NAACP on the need for economic assistance to Africa. He spoke with US Senator Hillary Clinton and President George W. Bush and first met the then-Senator Barack Obama. Mandela also encouraged Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe to resign over growing human rights abuses in the country. When this proved ineffective, he spoke out publicly against Mugabe in 2007, asking him to step down \"with residual respect and a modicum of dignity.\" That year, Mandela, Machel, and Desmond Tutu convened a group of world leaders in Johannesburg to contribute their wisdom and independent leadership to some of the world's toughest problems. Mandela announced the formation of this new group, The Elders, in a speech delivered on his 89th birthday.Mandela's 90th birthday was marked across the country on 18 July 2008, with the main celebrations held at Qunu, and a concert in his honour in Hyde Park, London. In a speech marking the event, Mandela called for the rich to help the poor across the world. Throughout Mbeki's presidency, Mandela continued to support the ANC, usually overshadowing Mbeki at any public events that the two attended. Mandela was more at ease with Mbeki's successor, Zuma, although the Nelson Mandela Foundation was upset when his grandson, Mandla Mandela, flew him out to the Eastern Cape to attend a pro-Zuma rally in the midst of a storm in 2009.In 2004, Mandela successfully campaigned for South Africa to host the 2010 FIFA World Cup, declaring that there would be \"few better gifts for us\" in the year marking a decade since the fall of apartheid. Despite maintaining a low profile during the event due to ill-health, Mandela made his final public appearance during the World Cup closing ceremony, where he received much applause. Between 2005 and 2013, Mandela, and later his family, were embroiled in a series of legal disputes regarding money held in family trusts for the benefit of his descendants. In mid-2013, as Mandela was hospitalised for a lung infection in Pretoria, his descendants were involved in an intra-family legal dispute relating to the burial place of Mandela's children, and ultimately Mandela himself.\n\n\n=== Illness and death: 2011\u20132013 ===\n\nIn February 2011, Mandela was briefly hospitalised with a respiratory infection, attracting international attention, before being re-admitted for a lung infection and gallstone removal in December 2012. After a successful medical procedure in early March 2013, his lung infection recurred and he was briefly hospitalised in Pretoria. In June 2013, his lung infection worsened and he was readmitted to a Pretoria hospital in serious condition. The Archbishop of Cape Town Thabo Makgoba visited Mandela at the hospital and prayed with Machel, while Zuma cancelled a trip to Mozambique to visit him the following day. In September 2013, Mandela was discharged from hospital, although his condition remained unstable.After suffering from a prolonged respiratory infection, Mandela died on 5 December 2013 at the age of 95, at around 20:50 local time (UTC+2) at his home in Houghton, surrounded by his family. Zuma publicly announced his death on television, proclaiming ten days of national mourning, a memorial service held at Johannesburg's FNB Stadium on 10 December 2013, and 8 December as a national day of prayer and reflection. Mandela's body lay in state from 11 to 13 December at the Union Buildings in Pretoria and a state funeral was held on 15 December in Qunu. Approximately 90 representatives of foreign states travelled to South Africa to attend memorial events. It was later revealed that 300 million rand originally earmarked for humanitarian development projects had been redirected to finance the funeral. The media was awash with tributes and reminiscences, while images of and tributes to Mandela proliferated across social media. His US$4.1 million estate was left to his widow, other family members, staff, and educational institutions.\n\n\n== Political ideology ==\n\nMandela identified as both an African nationalist, an ideological position he held since joining the ANC, and as a socialist. He was a practical politician, rather than an intellectual scholar or political theorist. According to biographer Tom Lodge, \"for Mandela, politics has always been primarily about enacting stories, about making narratives, primarily about morally exemplary conduct, and only secondarily about ideological vision, more about means rather than ends.\"The historian Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gatsheni described Mandela as a \"liberal African nationalist\u2013decolonial humanist\", while political analyst Raymond Suttner cautioned against labelling Mandela a liberal and stated that Mandela displayed a \"hybrid socio-political make-up\". Mandela adopted some of his political ideas from other thinkers\u2014among them Indian independence leaders like Gandhi and Nehru, African-American civil rights activists, and African nationalists like Nkrumah\u2014and applied them to the South African situation. At the same time he rejected other aspects of their thought, such as the anti-white sentiment of many African nationalists. In doing so he synthesised both counter-cultural and hegemonic views, for instance by drawing upon ideas from the then-dominant Afrikaner nationalism in promoting his anti-apartheid vision.His political development was strongly influenced by his legal training and practice, in particular his hope to achieve change not through violence but through \"legal revolution\". Over the course of his life, he began by advocating a path of non-violence, later embracing violence, and then adopting a non-violent approach to negotiation and reconciliation. When endorsing violence, he did so because he saw no alternative, and was always pragmatic about it, perceiving it as a means to get his opponent to the negotiating table. He sought to target symbols of white supremacy and racist oppression rather than white people as individuals, and was anxious not to inaugurate a race war in South Africa. This willingness to use violence distinguishes Mandela from the ideology of Gandhism, with which some commentators have sought to associate him.\n\n\n=== Democracy ===\nAlthough he presented himself in an autocratic manner in several speeches, Mandela was a devout believer in democracy and abided by majority decisions even when deeply disagreeing with them. He had exhibited a commitment to the values of democracy and human rights since at least the 1960s. He held a conviction that \"inclusivity, accountability and freedom of speech\" were the fundamentals of democracy, and was driven by a belief in natural and human rights. Suttner argued that there were \"two modes of leadership\" that Mandela adopted. On one side he adhered to ideas about collective leadership, although on the other believed that there were scenarios in which a leader had to be decisive and act without consultation to achieve a particular objective.According to Lodge, Mandela's political thought reflected tensions between his support for liberal democracy and pre-colonial African forms of consensus decision making. He was an admirer of British-style parliamentary democracy, stating that \"I regard the British Parliament as the most democratic institution in the world, and the independence and impartiality of its judiciary never fail to arouse my admiration.\" In this he has been described as being committed to \"the Euro-North American modernist project of emancipation\", something which distinguishes him from other African nationalist and socialist leaders like Nyerere who were concerned about embracing styles of democratic governance that were Western, rather than African, in origin. Mandela nevertheless also expressed admiration for what he deemed to be indigenous forms of democracy, describing Xhosa traditional society's mode of governance as \"democracy in its purest form\". He also spoke of an influential African ethical tenet, Ubuntu, which is a Ngnuni term meaning \"A person is a person through other persons\" or \"I am because we are.\"\n\n\n=== Socialism and Marxism ===\n\nMandela advocated the ultimate establishment of a classless society, with Sampson describing him as being \"openly opposed to capitalism, private land-ownership and the power of big money\". Mandela was influenced by Marxism, and during the revolution he advocated scientific socialism. He denied being a communist at the Treason Trial, and maintained this stance both when later talking to journalists, and in his autobiography. According to the sociologist Craig Soudien, \"sympathetic as Mandela was to socialism, a communist he was not.\" Conversely, the biographer David Jones Smith stated that Mandela \"embraced communism and communists\" in the late 1950s and early 1960s, while the historian Stephen Ellis commented that Mandela had assimilated much of the Marxist\u2013Leninist ideology by 1960.Ellis also found evidence that Mandela had been an active member of the South African Communist Party during the late 1950s and early 1960s, something that was confirmed after his death by both the ANC and the SACP, the latter of which claimed that he was not only a member of the party, but also served on its Central Committee. His membership had been hidden by the ANC, aware that knowledge of Mandela's former SACP involvement might have been detrimental to his attempts to attract support from Western countries. Mandela's view of these Western governments differed from those of Marxist\u2013Leninists, for he did not believe that they were anti-democratic or reactionary and remained committed to democratic systems of governance.The 1955 Freedom Charter, which Mandela had helped create, called for the nationalisation of banks, gold mines and land, to ensure equal distribution of wealth. Despite these beliefs, Mandela initiated a programme of privatisation during his presidency in line with trends in other countries of the time. It has been repeatedly suggested that Mandela would have preferred to develop a social democratic economy in South Africa but that this was not feasible as a result of the international political and economic situation during the early 1990s. This decision was in part influenced by the fall of the socialist states in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc during the early 1990s.\n\n\n== Personality and personal life ==\n\nMandela was widely considered a charismatic leader, described by biographer Mary Benson as \"a born mass leader who could not help magnetizing people\". He was highly image conscious and throughout his life always sought out fine quality clothes, with many commentators believing that he carried himself in a regal manner. His aristocratic heritage was repeatedly emphasised by supporters, thus contributing to his \"charismatic power\". While living in Johannesburg in the 1950s, he cultivated the image of the \"African gentleman\", having \"the pressed clothes, correct manners, and modulated public speech\" associated with such a position. In doing so, Lodge argued that Mandela became \"one of the first media politicians ... embodying a glamour and a style that projected visually a brave new African world of modernity and freedom\". Mandela was known to change his clothes several times a day, and he became so associated with highly coloured Batik shirts after assuming the presidency that they came to be known as \"Madiba shirts\".For political scientists Betty Glad and Robert Blanton, Mandela was an \"exceptionally intelligent, shrewd, and loyal leader\". His official biographer, Anthony Sampson, commented that he was a \"master of imagery and performance\", excelling at presenting himself well in press photographs and producing sound bites. His public speeches were presented in a formal, stiff manner, and often consisted of clich\u00e9d set phrases. He typically spoke slowly, and carefully chose his words. Although he was not considered a great orator, his speeches conveyed \"his personal commitment, charm and humour\".Mandela was a private person who often concealed his emotions and confided in very few people. Privately, he lived an austere life, refusing to drink alcohol or smoke, and even as President made his own bed. Renowned for his mischievous sense of humour, he was known for being both stubborn and loyal, and at times exhibited a quick temper. He was typically friendly and welcoming, and appeared relaxed in conversation with everyone, including his opponents. A self-described Anglophile, he claimed to have lived by the \"trappings of British style and manners\". Constantly polite and courteous, he was attentive to all, irrespective of their age or status, and often talked to children or servants. He was known for his ability to find common ground with very different communities. In later life, he always looked for the best in people, even defending political opponents to his allies, who sometimes thought him too trusting of others. He was fond of Indian cuisine, and had a lifelong interest in archaeology and boxing.\n\nHe was raised in the Methodist denomination of Christianity; the Methodist Church of Southern Africa claimed that he retained his allegiance to them throughout his life. On analysing Mandela's writings, the theologian Dion Forster described him as a Christian humanist, although added that his thought relied to a greater extent on the Southern African concept of Ubuntu than on Christian theology. According to Sampson, Mandela never had \"a strong religious faith\" however, while Boehmer stated that Mandela's religious belief was \"never robust\".Mandela was very self-conscious about being a man and regularly made references to manhood. He was heterosexual, and biographer Fatima Meer said that he was \"easily tempted\" by women. Another biographer, Martin Meredith, characterised him as being \"by nature a romantic\", highlighting that he had relationships with various women. Mandela was married three times, fathered six children, and had seventeen grandchildren and at least seventeen great-grandchildren. He could be stern and demanding of his children, although he was more affectionate with his grandchildren. His first marriage was to Evelyn Ntoko Mase in October 1944; they divorced in March 1958 under the multiple strains of his adultery and constant absences, devotion to revolutionary agitation, and the fact that she was a Jehovah's Witness, a religion requiring political neutrality. Mandela's second wife was the social worker Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, whom he married in June 1958. They divorced in March 1996. Mandela married his third wife, Gra\u00e7a Machel, on his 80th birthday in July 1998.\n\n\n== Reception and legacy ==\n\nBy the time of his death, within South Africa Mandela was widely considered both \"the father of the nation\" and \"the founding father of democracy\". Outside of South Africa, he was a \"global icon\", with the scholar of South African studies Rita Barnard describing him as \"one of the most revered figures of our time\". One biographer considered him \"a modern democratic hero\". Some have portrayed Mandela in messianic terms, in contrast to his own statement that \"I was not a messiah, but an ordinary man who had become a leader because of extraordinary circumstances.\" He is often cited alongside Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. as one of the 20th century's exemplary anti-racist and anti-colonial leaders. Boehmer described him as \"a totem of the totemic values of our age: toleration and liberal democracy\" and \"a universal symbol of social justice\".Mandela's international fame had emerged during his incarceration in the 1980s, when he became the world's most famous prisoner, a symbol of the anti-apartheid cause, and an icon for millions who embraced the ideal of human equality. In 1986, Mandela's biographer characterised him as \"the embodiment of the struggle for liberation\" in South Africa. Meredith stated that in becoming \"a potent symbol of resistance\" to apartheid during the 1980s, he had gained \"mythical status\" internationally. Sampson commented that even during his life, this myth had become \"so powerful that it blurs the realities\", converting Mandela into \"a secular saint\".  Within a decade of the end of his Presidency, Mandela's era was being widely thought of as \"a golden age of hope and harmony\", with much nostalgia being expressed for it. His name was often invoked by those criticising his successors like Mbeki and Zuma. Across the world, Mandela earned international acclaim for his activism in overcoming apartheid and fostering racial reconciliation, coming to be viewed as \"a moral authority\" with a great \"concern for truth\". Mandela's iconic status has been blamed for concealing the complexities of his life.Mandela generated controversy throughout his career as an activist and politician, having detractors on both the right and the radical left. During the 1980s, Mandela was widely labelled a terrorist by prominent political figures in the Western world for his embrace of political violence. According to Thatcher, for instance, the ANC was \"a typical terrorist organisation\". The US government's State and Defense departments officially designated the ANC as a terrorist organisation, resulting in Mandela remaining on their terrorism watch-list until 2008. On the left, some voices in the ANC\u2014among them Frank B. Wilderson III\u2014accused him of selling out for agreeing to enter negotiations with the apartheid government and for not implementing the reforms of the Freedom Charter during his Presidency. According to Barnard, \"there is also a sense in which his chiefly bearing and mode of conduct, the very respect and authority he accrued in representing his nation in his own person, went against the spirit of democracy\", and concerns were similarly expressed that he placed his own status and celebrity above the transformation of his country. His government would be criticised for its failure to deal with both the HIV/AIDS pandemic and the high levels of poverty in South Africa. Mandela was also criticised for his friendship with political leaders such as Castro, Gaddafi, and Suharto\u2014deemed dictators by critics\u2014as well as his refusal to condemn their governments' human rights violations.\n\n\n=== Orders, decorations, monuments, and honours ===\n\nOver the course of his life, Mandela was given over 250 awards, accolades, prizes, honorary degrees and citizenships in recognition of his political achievements.\nAmong his awards were the Nobel Peace Prize, the US Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Soviet Union's Lenin Peace Prize, and the Libyan Al-Gaddafi International Prize for Human Rights. In 1990, India awarded him the Bharat Ratna, and in 1992 Pakistan gave him their Nishan-e-Pakistan. The same year, he was awarded the Atat\u00fcrk Peace Award by Turkey; he at first refused the award, citing human rights violations committed by Turkey at the time, but later accepted the award in 1999. He was appointed to the Order of Isabella the Catholic and the Order of Canada, and was the first living person to be made an honorary Canadian citizen. Queen Elizabeth II appointed him as a Bailiff Grand Cross of the Order of St. John and granted him membership in the Order of Merit.In 2004, Johannesburg granted Mandela the Freedom of the City, and in 2008 a Mandela statue was unveiled at the spot where Mandela was released from prison. On the Day of Reconciliation 2013, a bronze statue of Mandela was unveiled at Pretoria's Union Buildings.\nIn November 2009, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed Mandela's birthday, 18 July, as \"Mandela Day\", marking his contribution to the anti-apartheid struggle. It called on individuals to donate 67 minutes to doing something for others, commemorating the 67 years that Mandela had been a part of the movement. In 2015 the UN General Assembly named the amended Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners as \"the Mandela Rules\" to honour his legacy.\n\n\n=== Biographies and popular media ===\nThe first biography of Mandela was authored by Mary Benson, based on brief interviews with him that she had conducted in the 1960s. Two authorised biographies were later produced by friends of Mandela. The first was Fatima Meer's Higher Than Hope, which was heavily influenced by Winnie and thus placed great emphasis on Mandela's family. The second was Anthony Sampson's Mandela, published in 1999. Other biographies included Martin Meredith's Mandela, first published in 1997, and Tom Lodge's Mandela, brought out in 2006.Since the late 1980s, Mandela's image began to appear on a proliferation of items, among them \"photographs, paintings, drawings, statues, public murals, buttons, t-shirts, refrigerator magnets, and more\", items that have been characterised as \"Mandela kitsch\". In the 1980s he was the subject of several songs, such as The Specials' \"Free Nelson Mandela\", Hugh Masekela's \"Bring Him Back Home (Nelson Mandela)\", and Johnny Clegg's \"Asimbonanga (Mandela)\", which helped to bring awareness of his imprisonment to an international audience.Following his death, many internet memes appeared featuring images of Mandela with his inspirational quotes superimposed onto them. Mandela has also been depicted in films on multiple occasions. Some of these, such as the 2013 feature film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom and the 1996 documentary Mandela, have focused on covering his long life, whereas others, such as the 2009 feature film Invictus and the 2010 documentary The 16th Man, have focused on specific events in his life. It has been argued that in Invictus and other films, \"the America film industry\" has played a significant part in \"the crafting of Mandela's global image\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nNelson Mandela Centre of Memory\nNelson Mandela Children's Fund\nNelson Mandela Foundation\nMandela Rhodes Foundation\nThe Elders\nNelson Mandela Museum\nNelson Mandela Day\nNelson Mandela's family tree\nWorks by or about Nelson Mandela in libraries (WorldCat catalog)\nNelson Mandela at Curlie\nNelson Mandela on IMDb\nAppearances on C-SPAN",

          "This place offers great views of Bloemfontein. We managed to enter just before sunrise, security allowed us through. So saw sunrise and then went to check out the statue of Nelson Mandela that overlooks Bloemfontein for the East. And then there is some wildlife too. Recommended!",
          "My wife and I visited Bloemfontein for a wedding and stayed near Naval Hill. We went to Naval Hill and took quite a lot of photos and enjoyed the view. We also saw some Zebras, giraffes and blue wildebeests.",
          "Been here for the fisrt time. Wont break me legs to come back, but was nice to see and go to the Planetarium show. I think its a must visit if it is your first time in Bloem",
          "Great place to come and look out over the city of roses. Since the statue was erected, the place has been well maintained and cared for. There are even some wildlife to admire. On Saturday morning there is a Parkrun held, giving you the opportunity to run in a wildlife reserve.",
          "Very neat, but I bought expensive tickets to listen to music and look at the stars but there was not enough seats for all. We Had to sit on the side on plastic chairs and could not see the stars.No one checked if visitors was sitting in the designated seating and children took",
          "Apart from the unique location of this well known landmark, I was impressed by how well it had been maintained. No visible litter - as opposed to the public places in the city centre! The safety of the visitors had also been considered by covering and securing the stones that",
          "Loved going to the Naval Hill pity the restaurant was either closed or no longer in service when we arrived.",
          "Ran the much earlier Naval Hill parkrun. Worth the scenery and serious cardio awaiting anyone who parks their car at the bottom of the hill. I was yet to participate in a parkrun that had post activities. Here there are. Fun and motivational.",
          "When you reach the top of Naval Hill, you have the nice view of Bloemfontein Town and allowed you to enjoy the beauty of its landscape.",
          "Whether you run or walk 5K - or take short cuts as I do -or just come at another time to drive around, Naval Hill offers spectacular views over the city of Bloemfontein, the most unlike Madiba statue of Madiba ever crafted, and the splendid wildebeest, blesbok, zebra, ostrich",
          "We were able to get a wonderful view of the city and the large statue of Nelson Mandela. The route is well marked but there is not much parking. The restaurant nearby is not open. Entrance is free although you do have to sign in at the security checkpoint. You do get occasional",
          "Naval hill offers excellent views of the city and some wildlife... but the best way to experience it is to go be active on Saturday mornings and join a group of runners and walkers doing the 5km parkrun. We encountered big herds of zebra and antelope whilst on foot - what an",
          "Beautiful views of Bloemfontein. Will definitely come back for the planetarium. Security guards were very helpful.",
          "Drove up to Naval Hill with colleagues just before our meeting. Great view on the city and the different neighbourhoods. Walked around in the fields close to giraffes, zebra, antelopes. Saw Mandela's statue. A haven in the middle of the city!",
          "The naval hill has turned out to be the lifestyle place to be, there is a planetarium, games, and viewing place as it is on the hill, you can actually view the better part of Bloemfontein while there. There is also a statue of our late icon (Madiba) Nelson Mandela, many people",
          "A very scenic place to visit. Almost 360 degree view of Bloemfontein. Well worth a visit. Recommended",
          "Naval Hill has so much potential, but it is full of rubbish, But worth while taking the drive up there to see the twon from all sides",
          "Naval Hill is a historic monument named after the Naval guns brought in by the British. The sculpture was created from rocks that were painted white answer despite its unknown origin and mythical stories that surround it, it stands as a proud landmark for the 'City of Roses' -",
          "The nature reserve is in desperate need of attention as tourist destination to make it enjoyable for visitors",
          "Book your ticket at Computicket, and learn more about our universe. Well worth the money. Not the old open roof type... All digital with a view around the earth",
          "Great nature reserve but it does not look like the dustbins get emptied often enough. Toilets in really bad state But the reserve was lovely to run in",
          "Take a drive up to the hill and see the city of Bloemfontein spread out before your eyes. Slightly unkempt and overgrown but still a restful escape from the normal city rush. Elevated views engender your thoughts to roam the Freestate savannah.",
          "Had a great moment on this hill, beautiful view of the city, a must visit, when visiting the city, was a perfect evening, lovely pictures to be taken.",
          "There really is nothing here. Only Mandela's statue and views of the city. But the planetarium is closed and there is no where to get any refreshments. Hopefully this will change when the new restaurant on The Edge opens. There's really got to be more than the view to entice",
          "Weve been there for a quick stop. Absolutely love the mandela statue and the city's view. The planetarium was closed because it was monday. Saw some zebras, giraffes and ostriches on our way back. Really nice!",
          "We were all waiting for the new restaurant to open and such a big fuss was made over this restaurant, but till today nothing is happening there. It would be nice to have a cold drink after a parkrun.",
          "Stunning views over the city, and it is extremely clean. Just a pity that the restaurant is not running, as it would be the most amazing place ever!",
          "We came across this by accident whilst staying in Bloemfontein, one of the first places we stayed on our trip to SA and certainly our first experience of the local wildlife, Springbok, Osterich and Giraffe along with Zebra could be seen just of the main road and all free at no",
          "Ever went on an African safari in the middle if a modern city before? No? Well now you can, a private game reserve allows you to see grazing wildlife without having to leave Bloemfontein. If thst's not for you, make sure to see the wonderful observatory right at the top.",
          "Walk up the stairs or drive the road with scores of runners and walkers, either way you will no doubt see a Zebra or Wildebeest as you journey up to the top of Naval Hill. The Mandela Statue alone is worth the trip up. That said, the vistas of Bloemfontein and the sunsets can",
          "Most Saturdays me and my kids would wake up early to join the park run at Naval Hill. It has really got me to enjoy the nature and the magnificent views of Bloemfontein. From these Saturday morning fun runs I am now going to run my first Soweto marathon this year. Never dispice",
          "I have not visited a planetarium for many years. This was really a highlight of my visit. Well presented, well planned. Everybody should visit",
          "This morning I went for a run from my hotel (Bon Hotel) in Bloemfontein and ran right to the Observatory on top of Naval Hill and also detoured to see Nelson Mandela's huge bronze statue. It was much easier going down. My legs had recovered from the Two Oceans Half marathon",
          "Not sure why it is Naval as nowhere near the sea. Pleasant drive round the hill via a private game reserve. Saw wildebeest and giraffe. Facilities at top seemed relatively new with monument to Nelson Mandela but very limited facilities other than basic toilets. Did not visit the",
          "The star gazing auditorium needs more comfortable chairs as the show is abit longer and after 10 minutes the neck muscles get strained.",
          "This is a nature reserve smack in the middle of the city with gorgeous views far and wide. Good the walks and cycling.",
          "The highspot (probably literally) if the city of flowers. Looming over the monstrous melange of concrete and palling, Naval Hill is festooned with radio masts and is about as far from the sea as Oklahoma. Only for the travel writer or truly bored.",
          "We got close up to 3 giraffe grazing on the road, stopped for a Zebra crossing - well, 3 actually joining another 4, saw a herd of Wildebeest and Springbok. Drove up to the viewpoint, had our picture taken with the giant Nelson Mandela statue (20 ZAR per picture, \u00a31.30) and",
          "Good views from the top of the drive but not much else to draw you up here. Bit tatty in places. Big statue of Nelson Mandela at the top",
          "A great place to look out over the city in the center of South Africa! The only wildlife resort in the middle of a city in the world I believe. It is quite an experience having a giraffe cross the road in front of you!",
          "Naval Hill is a unique gem in the heart of Bloemfontein. If you walk from the gate, around the brim of the hill and back, the distance is approximately 8 kilometers. There are also great views of the city. A statue of Nelson Mandela is a beautiful attraction. Toilets are",
          "Enjoy the sight seeing with my husband cycling up to Naval Hill alot and the view is just amazing will always return",
          "A visit to Naval Hill provided the finest view from atop Bloemfontein. An impressively large statue of Nelson Mandela crowned the hill. Within a kilometer of the peak we spotted giraffes, all and all quite worth the drive.",
          "Naval Hill is worth a trip, both for the view/Nelson Mandela statue and for the game watching. Saw giraffe, zebra, and various types of bok - for free! The Mandela statue at the top is quite impressive and a must-have photo. I would go here again if I was in Bloem.",
          "My family and I recently visited Bloemfontein and took a trip up Naval Hill. The plan was to go to the Planetarium, but unfortunately it was closed. We took a ride along the paths within the reserve and saw some awesome animals. I am not knowledgeable on game, but we saw some",
          "The place is good, but nothing is being done to increase or promote tourism, even keep the place up and up, no proper security or any refreshments available there too!",
          "This place is great to visit, especially to see the spectacular views of Bloemfontein, and Madiba's statue. It however, boggles my mind why our vehicle was searched ? And what for ?",
          "The drive to Naval Hill is worthwhile. The panoramic views of the city give you a good sense of place. I didn't think the Mandela statue is a particularly good likeness but it is a popular attraction. The story of the rabbit in the statue's ear is interesting. The game reserve",
          "Did a morning hike at the Naval Hill, it was a relatively easy hike_ Scenic view to see the most of Bloemfontein City Unfortunately we did not see any wildlife or animals for the day",
          "We love to do some jogging or MTB riding at Naval Hill. The University of the Free State also hosts some great events at the Naval Hill Observatory (tickets at the door and Computicket). The security on Naval Hill has been improved a lot, which is a comfort to all visitors.",
          "soothing to be on top of that hill, you will reach its top safely so.there is NELSON MANDELA statue at the top. you can view The beauty of Bloemfontein from the top. if you want to see the horizon ,that is the good spot to do that",
          "Naval hill as the name implies is a hill in the centre of Bloemfontein. This wild life sanctuary is anything but just a beautiful look out to view the surroundings of the city. There are a few things one should do: 1) You can find Giraffe, Wildebeest, and other small antelope",
          "I visited Naval Hill for the first time even though I've been to Bloemfontein many times before. I was stunned by the beautiful views it offered. The area seems safe with many people around. It is clean and well maintained. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "We saw giraffe on a scenic trip Had a wonderfull view of Bloemfontein Enjoyed the statue of Mandella towering over the city and went to a very informative lecture on the stars at the planetarium",
          "Good place to visit when in bloemfntein! Go at night when you can see all the lights!! Beautiful! To bad the restaurant is not open anymore. We also went to the planetarium for a show!was good",
          "It is good that gate security has been added. It make for a very nice and safe experience. Gate staff are friendly and signing in is a breeze. The drive around Naval Hill, though on gravel, the animals, walking along or next to the road is special and views of the city are",
          "I have been staying in Bloemfontein and can just see deteriation on this beutiful place from where you can vertually see the entire Bloemfontein. I see a beutiful restaurant standing as an white Elephant, closed.",

          "This used to be a wonderful picnic place for my family, going for a mini game drive to view giraffes, ostriches and several species of antelope. Great open spaces to escape city life. The old observatory is also still there and is now being used for shows and events.",
          "There were very few foreign visitors and the restaurant wasn't open. It was nice to see lots of locals, families and sport people, running and walking in the grounds. It was pleasant to be able to walk around the site and encounter wildlife.",
          "Visited Naval Hill again. Peacefull place in the middle of town. Good scenery. Will the road works ever be finished? Mandela statue a must see.",
          "The place has great animals roaming around. That's always lovely to see. The new Mandela status is a great addition to the place. You can have a decent hike up the place. Definetely recommend it.",
          "So I hate running! Yes it's good for one' health however unless a dog is chasing me, I don't see the reason why I should torture myself. Then I went up Naval Hill. What a climb...I didn't have to run. The 2.5km climb to the top was worth every pain in my chest. Great view of",
          "I recently visited in the evening to enjoy the nice view over Bloemfontein. I must really recommend the municipality for the effort they put into improving the facilities and making the area safe, even after dark.",
          "We had a quick drive through the park and was lucky to get very close to giraffes and zebras. We also had good views of Bloemfontein. It's usually quite up there.",
          "there is not much to see. Its beautiful and all but if you see it once it's fine!! I did enjoy it a bit though. The road is not really in good condition",
          "For the adventurous, there are park runs every Saturday. For families, there are built up walkways thru \"the biggest wildlife area in a city\" (you might even spot a giraffe or two). For stargazers, be sure to catch a show at the planetarium. For everyone else, you MUST take a",
          "Going to the planetarium is fine, but I would not go to Naval Hill itself anymore... views a stunning though!",
          "Nice lookout from high on a hill inside a nature reserve. Worthwhile doing the short drive and spending some time at the lookout point",
          "The views of Bloemfontein are outstanding. The General layout and Cleanliness of the area is very good. At the time of our visit, the Restuarant was not functioning, although the proposed locality is very good. Nelson Mandalas Statue is well designed and is worth the visit. We",

          "There is not another place in the world where you will find a giraffe roaming around in a neighborhood. The nelson mandela statue towers over the city as if guarding it. Also on top of this hill is the planetarium where they have scheduled programs every now and then. Only",

          "Excellent views of the City of Bloem - commanding statue of our icon Madiba - pity the restaurant seems to be closed - even though the place was teaming with guests. Besides the view, and the statue and the opportunity for stunning photos, the restaurant would have been perfect",
          "This is a good park to visit. The shows that we saw at the planetarium was so good. We love to go and drive through the park.",
          "Always love taking a drive up here. Still amazes me after all these years that you have a wildlife reserve in the middle of town. First time showing the wife around and the look on her face, absolutely worth it",

          "The views of Bloemfontein from on top of Naval Hill is great. Pity the town doesn't really have famous buildings to spot from here. The Madiba statue is a great addition to the area. Don't try going down to the white horse though as the paths are washed away and it is next to",
          "A few years ago this was becoming a run-down venue with unsavory characters hanging around using it as a drinking and partying spot. It has been upgraded, landscaped and turned into a marvelous area with a huge statue of Mandela overlooking the city of Bloemfontein. With",

          "With Bloemfontein suffering one of its worst droughts in decades, the heat and dust storm made it unpleasant. Rumours of a restaurant being built is still just that. The view of Bloem is good and under different circumstances would have been great. Lots of walks and home to a",

          "A must see and a must visit. The only city/town in the world with a game reserve within it's boundaries. Stop at the various viewpoints to look out over the horizon to see tomorrow approaching. Magnificent views of the city and surrounding areas at a few glances. Visit the",

          "With beefed up security and safety for tourists and visitors, Naval Hill is a wonderful place to see as far as the eye can see. And of course, the giant statue of Nelson Mandela looks out over Bloemfontein. There is a few wild-life left in the reserve, so keep an eye out for",

          "This over run, pot-holed road to nowhere is not worth the effort. The are hardly any vantage points to get a decent view from and twice we drove past people using the side of the road as a urinal. It seems more like a quite spot for young lover indiscretions than a tourist",
          "Great city views and Nelson Mandela statue, along with the unexpected visit of a free-ranging ostrich, made a visit here a real treat.",
          "Stopped with a group and had wonderful views of the city at sunset. The Mandela statue is definitely worth a visit. We even saw an ostrich roaming around!",

          "We drove up Naval Hill this morrning anticipating great views & some signs of the history attached to the area. Disappointingly all 9 viewpoints were badly signposted & maintained. The bushes everywhere have been allowed to grow unchecked so the views are obstructed. Also,",
          "Naval Hill is a fast growing tourists attraction of distinction in Bloemfontein. Although still under development, there are certain things that make it stand out. The altitude: The change of altitude as you drive/cycle/run/walk up the slope of the mountain is an experience",
          "This is the only National Park situated within City limits. You can drive, cycle, run or walk all he way around the reserve. There are numerous animals to be seen, including Girafe, Zebra, Ostrich & numerous other types of Buck. Geocachers will love this reserve as there are",
          "Overall, the site leaves a good impression. It is nicely constructed and well maintained. You can see all of Bloemfontein spread out below from various lookout platfroms, but unfortunately Bloemfontein is not a particularly inspiring sight.",
          "very interesting ....we saw quite a few wild animals along with the impressive statue of Mandela..a great picture taking spot..",
          "The view of the city from Naval Hill is really great - remember to pack your camera. A guide to point out the main attractions and places of interest from the top would be nice. But it's still worth a visit.",
          "Hope they turn the Mandela statue and restaurant into something good. Statue doesn't look much like Mandela but does the trick.",
          "Good way to spend an afternoon! You can visit the Mandela statue, have a drive around the reserve and visit the planetarium on show days.",
          "This is the best place to get a great view of the city. Especially at sunset, which are spectacular. Great photo opportunity.",
          "Naval hill is a game reserve in the outer region of Bloemfontein. Through some curvy roads you can make your way up the hill. Make sure to stop once in a while to enjoy the view on each side of the hill. You can see the cooling towers of the power plant, the two university's,",
          "Pity that this facility is not cared for. I often take a drive around here and each time I am more disappointed. This is something unique - but it is not cared for. A huge pity.",
          "A random experience in the city of roses. Have a casual Sunday drive up and pretend you are in the Kruger Park. Giraffe, wildebeest, zebra and several deer species to be seen. Added bonus of the new viewing decks over Bloemfontein and the statue of Mandela. Wonder when the new",
          "There is not much you can do in Bloemfontein regarding tourist attractions, so if you are there I would recommend going to Naval Hill. Entrance is free. Nice to enjoy some take aways over a sunset.",
          "When in Bloemfontein, take the time to drive up to Naval Hill in the winter of summer, an hour before sunset. The Free state sky will be spectacular, guarenteed! Bring a picnic and enjoy the views from here. Under the larger than life statue of our Madiba! And take a picutre",
          "I visited Naval Hill frequently during 1988 and 1989..running among wild animals was cool! Now the same still applies but with a stunning lookout over the City of Roses with a massive statue of Madiba for company! Well kept...tidy....all good.",
          "We went three times, and it was worth it every time, as the animals are in different places... on our third visit the giraffe were 1 meter out our baki window... nothing like it a super memorable experience!",
          "Naval Hill itself looks a bit tattered, and the general ambience is very sun-scorched 80s... but this is not your main reason to visit. The Planetarium is brand new and is the only digital in sub-Saharan Africa. Top quality seating, stunning visuals and a truly informative look",
          "Naval Hill has been getting a lot of political attention, just a pity the history of the Anglo Boer war is not upgraded like the rest which is right next to the Mandela statue",
          "Very nice if you want to have a nice view of the city. Place was clean, and entrance is free. If you feel for a jog, this is a nice place to choose. But I heard it is not safe to come here in the evening, so be careful or go in groups rather.",
          "Great view of town - we went in the afternoon beautiful light comes from behind. Get close to Mandela statue. Couple of Zebras in the Nature Reserve. If you've been to game parks no need to go there.",
          "Its the best place to get a view of the city. The Nelson Mandela statue is worth a visit. When the restaurant is complete then there will be a place to get meals and drinks.",
          "Stunning views of Bloem, but drive through in daylight, as safety at night is an issue (be alert even in daytime) some antelope and giraffe on display, as well as a few tortoises, but that is pretty much it. Since the Observatory theatre has been closed, another part of",
          "Great place to see the city from. Go and visit the Mandela statue and sometime in the future maybe have a bite to eat at the restaurant. Driving around on the hill feels like your on some game farm rather than the middle of the city. Be vigilant as safety might be an issue if",
          "More than anything I appreciated the views of the city from virtually every direction. I do wish there was some kind of guide to help you orientate your travel around the summit of the hill.",
          "Home to the Planetariam & a stunning little hill with a 360 degree view of the city in the middle of the city with Nelson Mandela's new statue keeping guardian over this quiet peaceful South African town. The main area where the statue is is quite safe, but in quieter areas - do",
          "If you have been to Cape Town, please do not compare Naval Hill to Signal View etc. The site gives you a nice complete arial view of Bloemfontein, plus Bloemfontein is only a 15 minutes city, you see pretty much the whole of Bloemfontein. If you are not prepared to pay for",
          "I grew up and Bloem so always enjoy driving up here. It is as close as I can get my pommie husband to a few giraffes, blesbok and blue wildebeest. The new viewing decks are a welcome. Good to fill a late afternoon.",
          "Security is always an issue so be a big group when visiting and go check it out in several vehicles. A very nice view in day and in sunset / night. Take take- away's and go eat up there with several friends in a group.",
          "Plenty of new additions to the top of the hill, with more to come, but the very lovely views of Bloemfontein and of the surrounding countryside remains the same. Lovely spot to sit and think for a few minutes.",
          "It is a good place to get an idea of the size of the city and also a nice get away where you can see giraffes, zebra etc. Because they are working on the site it is rather difficult to get to the sculpture of Nelson Mandela, but once you find it, it is impressive.",
          "Walked the circle around the top of Naval Hill a few times during the daytime, it's quite strange to walk round a corner and see giraffes in the middle of a city and a nice break from the noise. One of the few places to walk in Bloemfontein",
          "When I was a student we used to drive up in the evenings and enjoyed the freedom just to sit there and talk and enjoy the view. i could'nt find a single soul not warning us to stay away as it is mot save up there. The road also in a bad condition. There used to be an excellant",
          "Good trip for sunset or just to get your bearings over the city. Take a drive up to the 4 view points through the NP which if im not mistaken is the only one in the world that is in the middle of a city. Sunset great time to go up and also great for a jog if your into that kinda",
          "We had time to spare and went to naval hill. No admission fee - we were surprised. We saw the sign about wild life, but did not think that we would see any. We did. Near the observatory, we saw where the rangers feed the animals in winter. There were ostriches, zebra and",
          "We went to Naval Hill for 2 reasons, to spy some game and to have a look at the newly erected statue of Mandela. While driving around we did find some small antelope, but we couldn't find the giraffe couple that used to roam there a few years ago. There are loads of little",
          "A visit to Naval Hill has become a completely new and exciting experience. The presence of the Iconic Mandela Statue that overlooks the city is a great experience. It's presence completely fills the precinct. Viewing Points is just a fantastic feature that affords the viewer the",
          "If you stay in Bloem for a while you should really go to Navill Hill at night to see the 'liggies' of the city",
          "Great to view the newly erected Madiba statue a tribute to a great icon of South Africa. Great view of Bloemfontein.",
          "Don't go there when dark at ALL, and during day go in a group. Enjoy Mandela's statue. Have lunch at at this great man's feet. It is free, but let me remind you again: don't go alone.",
          "With the newly erected bronze statue of Nelson Mandela this is a worthwhile visit if in Bloem. Being so new the logistics are still a work in progress and the parking and area around the staue part of the planned upgrade but not yet done, it is a bit mumble jumble but still a",
          "Naval hill has received a new lease on life with the new and biggest bronze statue of Madiba, ( Nelson Mandela), in the world on the hill overlooking Bloemfontein. It is well done , very safe, the crowd very pleasant and the police very visible. Go see it !!",
          "The place is deteriorating. Fire destroyed much of the natural beauty and wild life. Neglected assets seem to be the order of the day in SA these days.",
          "As far as education of the disadvantaged public this is a fantastic venue to teach Wilderness awareness. The proximity is excellent.",
          "This is really your first stop to get a geographical view of th bounderies of Bloemfontein. While visiting this Reserve you would feel if you are in Nature with wild animals surrounding you during your visit. Tour guide nessesary because they would be able to brief you about the",
          "It is definately not safe to visit Naval Hill. To visitors make sure that you visit during day time and in a group and avoid night time.",
          "Been neglected by the Metro and is considered a hang out for those on a high! A pity as it really has some great view. Was pecial when you could see giraffe etc.",
          "You should always go in a group....Crime in the area is bad",
          "The view of the city at night is amazing, nature lovers will love to see animals like the springbok running around.",
          "Great views of the city and a couple of giraffes in the park",
          "Naval Hill is situated in the middle of the Franklin Game Reserve, and is currently the only Game reserve in the whole world located in the middle of a city. Naval Hill is a wondrous place with an excellent view of the whole of Bloemfontein. Anyone can access this amazing"

          "Another must see in London. We were lucky to have good weather. To walk around the statues and fountains made for a lovely day. Well worth the time to walk around this area and soak in the sights.",
          "We stopped here briefly since it is right outside of the National Galleries. The statues and fountains were beautiful, and if you are up on top looking down at it there are some beautiful views of London. It\u2019s worth a quick stop if you are in the area.",
          "Hard to get in today due to Extinction Rebellion protests. Still got to see the lions, even though they were bedecked in flags. Love the Egyptian 4th plinth.",

          "I didn't find it anything special. Just a busy square with a lot of traffic around it. It was also a rainy day. Probably nicer to sit next to the fountain on a sunny day after walking through the city",

It\u2019s a great spot for pictures or to stand and observe everything around you. It\u2019s such a bustling part of the city. It\u2019s",
          "Great place to see and the Covent Garden is just a walking distance away. There isn't much to do at the square except take some photos with the monuments but you can shop and eat at the Covent Garden. Lots of food and a good place to buy souvenirs.",
          "It is hard to say anything about Trafalgar Square that has not been said before. It is said that if you stand at the base of Nelson's Column long enough you will eventually see everyone you know in the world. That is probably true. The key though is everything else that is",
          "Walking further from Waterloo towards Trafalgar Square. Bordering the National Gallery and Canadian embassy, it\u2019s impossible to miss Trafalgar Square with its imposing statues and a lovely fountain at the center, that had a golden gleam against the setting sun. There is also a",

          "Very busy spot with people everywhere. I enjoyed the street performers and my girls even got sucked in by one selling wrist bands lol",
          "A nice place to catch your breath and watch the people and listen to the music. It is very vibrant and full of energy with the people hustling around or just standing/sitting and discussing life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness...lol I've always wanted to say that...",
          "Perfect meeting place and a great crossroads for Royal London, old London and Theater London. So much to see in such a short walk from Trafalgar Square.",
          "The good thing is, it is really near many other major historical attractions, e.g. Buckingham palace, national gallery, the mall, pall mall, Whitehall etc. So, chances are you will be passing by anyway so you might as well stop! It's mainly just a place to take some great",

          "A usually must visit attraction of London, the Trafalgar Square with its fountain is presently under renovation, as is much of London's other edifices and monuments. While such restoration is necessary, it was certainly disappointing not to be able to see the fountain in",
          "In September we spent a week in London and on maybe 5 occasions we ended up in Trafalgar Square at 6pm where I would happily sit on the steps along with many many other complete strangers enjoying the atmosphere. People chatting, laughing, buskers doing their thing. Others",

          "Sit down relax and watch the world go by or listen to street entertainers or warch the street artists unfortunately you can't jump into these pictures like in Mary Poppins. Did you know that somewhere in the square is the smallest police station in England, thousands of people",
          "For some reason, I've always thought this to be London's best square. It must be the combination of the fountains, the magnificent buildings of the National Gallery, the High Commissions of South Africa, Canada and Uganda, Admiralty Arch and the lovely church of St.",
          "It would appear that anyone can set up a stand and start lecturing all and sundry on the evils of being a human being without any intervention from the authorities. Luckily there are lots of pigeons too!",
          "Cant believe I missed this last time I was in London. Great place in the hub of Central London surrounded by embassies and lovely statues and monuments. A short stroll to Covent Garden, Chinatown and the Thames. Loved to old buildings, a must if you are in London.",
          "Rice history and phenomenal monuments. Our guide was very friendly and informative. I would definitely recommend this place.",
          "Went there first thing in the morning - no one was there. Great to take photos. Went back there in the afternoon - people everywhere. You just have to go there - it's Trafalgar Square!!!",
          "Came out of tube straight into Trafalger Square still awe inspiring after all the years of visiting London really is the best place in the world when the sun is shining!",
          "You can\u2019t come to London without visiting here...yes it\u2019s extremely busy but we still managed to find our own little quiet spot and take it all in..look out for some of the street artists..very talented...there are toilets and a cafe if needs arise..enjoy.",

          "The area is under repair or reconstruction so it doesn\u2019t have the same presence as I was anticipating - Nelson\u2019s column is fabulous and who doesn\u2019t love the lions but the view down to Big Ben is also marred but eh fact that the tower is under massive scaffolding until 2021 ! So",
          "Trafalgar Square has many fond memories for me. As a child, going with my grandma and father to feed the pigeons. Unfortunately, you can\u2019t do this anymore which is a real shame but the bird droppings did cause a great deal of damage. Trafalgar Square is a beautiful place in",

          "Honestly it was more the idea of being and seeing Trafalgar square rather than how impressing actually this place is...most of the times noisy to extremely noisy due to traffic and quite grey...try to visit outside of busy traffic hours - maybe on weekend. Best part to sit and",
          "Kids love this place the most we had to revisit the 2 day. It looks like amusement park, thanks to these Lion statues. On the bucket list if you accompanied with children. Even myself couldn't help the inner child of me from climbing theses Lions. C U Around",
          "Entertainers, street art and protests provide lots to look at in addition to the beautiful square. The National Gallery is a prominent building and worth visiting once you take in the commotion of the square.",

          "Trafalgar Square is one of the most known areas of London with rather significant history behind it. However, it may look a bit ordinary (should have been cleaner for sure). We have visited the square endless times over the last 20+ years, but still think it is missing some",
          "The Trafalgar square is an open war memorial with statues and pieces of art. It is surrounded by museums and several embassies. It is super crowded and impossible to get by car or bus during rush hour. However, it is a must to go and see when in London. It is a walking",

          "Again another place you must visit, a simple walk through it and see the famous lions, Nelson's Column and the back of the gallery. It's a truly spectacular space full to the brim of period buildings and magnificent stuff to look at. Don't listen to me, just go\")",
          "We were really excited doing the sightseeing trail and when we got to Trafalgar Square it was filled with Pakistani protestors doing massive group shots and selfies. The police were present but it just meant tourists got to stand back from the monuments",
          "A very large square, surrounded by great architecture of the many period building. Always something going on there, be it a protest or street musicians. Great fun. Plus the big blue what ever on the courner steps",
          "Another amazing place to visit. Easy to get to from Buckingham palace. Just walk down The Mall where there is no traffic. It felt weird walking down the road but watch out for cyclists. Another iconic place to visit. Toilets handy but there is a small fee for a pee.",

          "We had a lovely time in Trafalgar Square last weekend and the water fountain was put on. There were lots of people at the square and the place was clean and spacious. An iconic place to visit and to hang out with family and friends for a nice weekend With lots of restaurants",

          "Sat for hours ,people watching ,while our eight year old granddaughter thoroughly enjoyed exploring while we explained its history. Think it\u2019s probably one of the nicest London squares. Clean too, but admit I did miss the pigeons!",

          "This site is very good but going at the right time could make it excellent. As expected, it's very busy and lots of crowds with performers, artists and interest groups. If you don't care about crods and better photos, simply go anytime and it's great. If one goes in very early",

          "I struggled with whether to give this 3 or 4 stars. It's a solid 3.5 for me, above average but not VERY good. I didn't give Trafalgar Square points for what it is close to. Those museums, shops, and restaurants deserve their own ratings. I am just focused on the square itself,",
          "This place is much bigger than it looks in pictures! There were a ton of people there and people watching was my fave part about it. There was also a drinking fountain there which is good cuz there don\u2019t seem to be too many around London.",

          "Lots of history and we bought cheap lunch and then sat and watched across the square which was fun. Lots of cultures, different standards of behaviours ( a few drunks and homeless people) but stacks of history and an epic setting ! Recommended visit just watch personal",

          "A lovely area full of performers and places to sit and enjoy lunch. Lots of eating places nearby but also full of traffic.",
          "Trafalgar square is a traffic island. During the hours of 11am till 8pm it is so busy and congested with traffic that you are advised not to go there. An almost constant traffic jam persists, the trapped cars, lorries, buses and bikes belching an intense atmosphere of exhaust",

          "Trafalgar Square is located infront of the National Gallery along intersection of Strand St, Pall Mall E, Whitehall, A4, A400 and on top of Charring Cross Station. In the square there are two fountains, Neslon Column and statues - King George IV, General Sir Charles James Napier",
          "The square is well known for the various gatherings and demos that that take place from time to time. However this great square is far more useful than just a place for people to gather for demonstrations. Its in the centre of the city, surrounded by a number of embassies",
          "Nice place to stop and take pictures on our way to Buckingham Palace. Beautiful fountains and the statute of Lord Admiral Viscount Horatio Nelson is very impressive. The Admiralty Arch is across the road, which then leads to the Mall, which then leads to Buckingham Palace.",
          "Looking clean and was incredibly busy shame no pigeons and the statues are very grand. The column is rather splendid. It is expensive in this area. There is a cafe on the square itself but was too pricey.",
          "Unfortunately they were setting up a stage for some kind of concert so half of it was closed. It's a fountain in a public square. Good place to rest and \"people watch\". Nothing more to it. I suppose you have to go just to say \"you've been there\"."

        "wiki": "Bloemfontein (; Afrikaans: [\u02c8blumf\u0254nt\u025bin]; also known as Bloem) is the capital city of the province of Free State of South Africa; and, as the judicial capital of the nation, one of South Africa's three national capitals (the other two being Cape Town, the legislative capital, and Pretoria, the administrative capital) and is the seventh largest city in South Africa. Situated at an elevation of 1,395 m (4,577 ft) above sea level, the city is home to approximately 520,000 residents and forms part of the Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality which has a population of 747,431. It was one of the host cities for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nThe city of Bloemfontein hosts the Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa, the Franklin Game Reserve, Naval Hill, the Maselspoort Resort and the Sand du Plessis Theatre. The city hosts numerous museums, including the National Women's Monument, the Anglo-Boer War Museum, the National Museum, and the Oliewenhuis Art Museum.\nBloemfontein also host sub-Saharan Africa's first digital planetarium, the Naval Hill Planetarium and Boyden Observatory, an astronomical research observatory erected by Harvard University.\nBloemfontein is popularly and poetically known as \"the city of roses\", for its abundance of these flowers and the annual rose festival held there. The city's Sesotho name is Mangaung, meaning \"place of cheetahs\". Its !Orakobab name is \u01c0\u02bcAuxa \u01c3X\u0101s or \u01c0Kx\u02bcauxa \u01c3X\u0101s (Khoekhoegowab spelling: \u01c0Auxa !Kh\u0101s), which refers to Jan Bloem II, known as !X\u0101s-aob or Blumtseb who was a gaokx\u02bcaob (chief) of the \u01c0\u0168di\u01c1\u02bcaes (Springbok Clan) of the !Ora (\"Korana\") nation, whose kraal was the original settlement before the city was built.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe origin of the city's name is disputed. It has been assumed to be from the Dutch words bloem (flower) and fontein (fountain), meaning fountain of flowers. Popular colonial legends include an ox named \"Bloem\" owned by Rudolphus Martinus Brits, one of the pioneer farmers that was taken by a lion near a fountain on his property, while the more likely indigenous history names Jan Bloem II (1775\u20131858), a !Ora (\"Korana\" Khoekhoe) leader who settled there.  His father, Jan Bloem, was a fugitive from the Cape Colony, where he reportedly was escaping arrest after murdering his first wife. Bloem was well known as an expert marksmen, and married into the \u01c0H\u00f5a\u01c1\u02bcaes (Katz clan) and \u01c0\u0168di\u01c1\u02bcaes where he played a role in training !Ora artillery fighters during the first !Ora Wars (a century prior to the second !Ora Wars) on the \u01c2N\u016b!arib (Orange River) in the second half of the 18th century CE. His son was born in 1775 into the Springbok Clan (\u01c0\u0168di\u01c1\u02bcaes), later becoming the kapteijn or chief of this polity.\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThough historically a !Orana settlement, and then a Boer settlement, Bloemfontein was officially founded in 1846 as a fort by British army major Henry Douglas Warden as a British outpost in the Transoranje region, at that stage occupied by various groups of peoples including !Orana (so-called \"Korana\" of the \u01c0H\u00f5a\u01c1\u02bcaes, \u01c0H\u0169di\u01c1\u02bcaes, Eini\u01c1\u02bcaes and others), Cape Colony Trek Boers, Griqua (at that time known as Baasters), and Barolong.\nWarden originally chose the site largely because of its proximity to the main route to Winburg, the spacious open country, and the absence of horse sickness. Bloemfontein was the original farm of Johannes Nicolaas Brits born 21 February 1790, owner and first inhabitant of Bloemfontein. Johann \u2013 as he was known \u2013 sold the farm to Major Warden.With colonial policy shifts, the region changed into the Orange River Sovereignty (1848\u201354) and eventually the Orange Free State Republic (1854\u20131902). From 1902\u201310 it served as the capital of the Orange River Colony and since that time as the provincial capital of the Free State. In 1910 it became the Judicial capital of the Union of South Africa.\n\n\n=== Orange Free State (1854\u20131902) ===\nThe Orange Free State was an independent Boer sovereign republic in southern Africa during the second half of the 19th century. Extending between the Orange and Vaal rivers, its borders were determined by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1848 when the region was proclaimed as the Orange River Sovereignty, with a seat of a British Resident in Bloemfontein.\nAs the capital of the Orange Free State Republic the growth and maturing of the republic resulted in the growth of Bloemfontein. The city constructed numerous public buildings that remain in use today, facilitated by the governance of the republic and compensation from the British for the loss of the diamond rich Griqua Land area. The old Orange Free State's presidential residence the Old Presidency is currently a museum and cultural space in the city.\nA railway line was built in 1890 connecting Bloemfontein to Cape Town.\nThe writer J. R. R. Tolkien was born in the city on 3 January 1892, though his family left Orange Free State (now Free State province, South Africa) following the death of his father, Arthur Tolkien, when Tolkien was three (1895). He recorded that his earliest memories were of \"a hot country\".In 1899 the city was the site of the Bloemfontein Conference, which failed to prevent the outbreak of the Second Boer War. The conference was a final attempt to avert a war between Britain and the South African Republic. With its failure the stage was set for war, which broke out on 11 October 1899.\nThe rail line from Cape Town provided a centrally located railway station, and proved critical to the British in occupying the city later.\nOn 13 March 1900, following the Battle of Paardeberg, British forces captured the city and built a concentration camp nearby to house Boer women and children. The National Women's Monument, on the outskirts of the city, pays homage to the 26,370 women and children as well as 1,421 old men (also 14,154 black people, though some sources feel that the records are unsatisfactory, and that this number could be as high as 20,000) who died in these camps in various parts of the country.The hill in town was named Naval Hill after the naval guns brought in by the British in order to fortify the position against attack.\n\n\n=== Unionisation of South Africa (1910s) ===\nOn 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the Boers signed the Peace Treaty of Vereeniging that ended the Anglo-Boer War between the British Empire and two Boer states, the South African Republic (Republic of Transvaal) and the Orange Free State, South Africa became a Union.Due to disagreements over where the Union's capital should be, a compromise was reached that allowed Bloemfontein to host Appellate Division and become the Union's judicial capital. Bloemfontein was also given financial compensation.On 8 January 1912, the South African Native National Congress (SANNC) was founded in Bloemfontein. The Union of South Africa had not granted rights to black South Africans, causing the organisation's creation. Its primary aim was to fight for the rights of black South Africans.From 1 to 9 January 1914, James Barry Munnik Hertzog and his supporters met in Bloemfontein to form the National Party of the Orange Free State, and to lay down its principles, following Hertzog's exit from the South African Party in 1913. The National Party grew to govern South Africa in 1948 and implement the policy of racial segregation known as apartheid.\n\n\n=== Apartheid era (1948\u20131994) ===\nWhen the National Party won the 1948 South African national government elections they began implementing the policy known as apartheid. The policy was built on white supremacy and racial segregation was implemented. In Bloemfontein, residential segregation had begun in the 19th century with the passing of Ordinance 1 of 1860, which determined that no non-white, without written permission from the landlord, had the right to occupy urban land in towns where local municipalities did not yet exist. On 3 June 1861, the council demarcated three locations in the following areas; the black population was to move to the area which lay to the right of a neighbourhood that was known as Kaffirfontein, Coloureds were to move to the Waaihoek Black residential area on the eastern outskirts of the town. The inhabitants of these settlements had to pay taxes; the so-called hut tax as well as tax on grazing rights. This laid the foundation for the implementation of residential urban segregation as envisaged by the architects of apartheid.\nWhen the South African apartheid government passed the Group Areas Act of 1950, the Bloemfontein municipality put into effect changes in the racial set-up of the city. The municipality demolished the Cape Stands residential area which was occupied by the city's coloured population and moved the residents to Heidedal. However, due to Coloureds living in such close proximity with black people; intermarriages across racial lines occurred, resulting in a partial mixed population in Heidedal and Mangaung. In 1952 the Bloemfontein municipality began building new residential areas for the city's black population. New residential areas to separate ethnic groups such as Sotho, Xhosa and Tswana were formed. The residential areas were jointly known as Mangaung. Phahameng, a Sotho township, was the first formal housing projects to be approved by the municipality in 1956. Physical buffers such as the railway line and roads were put into place to separate black ethnic groups, the white and coloured population.11 000 housing structures, of which approximately 6 000 were government built rental accommodation, were erected in Mangaung between 1952- 1968.In 1968, Mangaung faced serious housing shortages when as many as 3000 to 6000 housing units were needed. To counter this problem, a 55 km east ward expansion called Botshabelo was added in 1979. The Bloemfontein municipality channelled of all black urbanisation to Thaba Nchu and Botshabelo.\nBotshabelo was developed as source of cheap labour for the city of Bloemfontein. A subsidised bus service was established, and Botshabelo was declared decentralisation point. This means that Botshabelo was to become an industrial development point in order to reduce the distance between place of employment and place of residence. In 1988, an approximate 14 500 people were commuting on a daily basis between Botshabelo and Bloemfontein. This meant that 55% of Botshabelo's work force was employed outside the city.In 1994, after the disestablishment of the apartheid government, Bloemfontein, Botshabelo, and Thaba Nchu became part of Motheo District Municipality. The Motheo District Municipality was disestablished on 18 May 2011 and Mangaung was upgraded to become an autonomous metropolitan municipality with Bloemfontein as the main seat.\n\n\n=== Since 1994 ===\nUntil 1994 the city was the sole judicial capital of South Africa. It remains the seat for the Supreme Court of Appeal (formerly the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court). It is also an administrative centre with many private hospitals and educational institutions.\n\n\n== Government ==\nFree State Provincial Government building\nBloemfontein forms part of the Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality, which was upgraded from a Local Municipality in 2011.\nThe Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality elects a municipal council for five-year periods, through a mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) system in which wards elect individual councillors alongside those named from party lists. Voters get two votes: one for a representative to become a ward councillor and the other for a political party. The latter vote is used to distribute seats in the municipal council amongst parties while the former distributes seats through the individual representatives. The current Executive Mayor of Mangaung, Olly Mlamleli, was elected in August 2016.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\nBloemfontein is located in central South Africa on the southern edge of the Highveld at an elevation of 1,400 metres (4,600 ft), bordering on the semi-arid region of the Karoo. The area is generally flat with occasional hills (koppies in Afrikaans) and the general vegetation is Highveld grassland. Bloemfontein experiences a semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk\u202f), with hot summer days and cooler, dry winters, often with frosts.

        "wiki": "Bloemfontein (; Afrikaans: [\u02c8blumf\u0254nt\u025bin]; also known as Bloem) is the capital city of the province of Free State of South Africa; and, as the judicial capital of the nation, one of South Africa's three national capitals (the other two being Cape Town, the legislative capital, and Pretoria, the administrative capital) and is the seventh largest city in South Africa. Situated at an elevation of 1,395 m (4,577 ft) above sea level, the city is home to approximately 520,000 residents and forms part of the Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality which has a population of 747,431. It was one of the host cities for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nThe city of Bloemfontein hosts the Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa, the Franklin Game Reserve, Naval Hill, the Maselspoort Resort and the Sand du Plessis Theatre. The city hosts numerous museums, including the National Women's Monument, the Anglo-Boer War Museum, the National Museum, and the Oliewenhuis Art Museum.\nBloemfontein also host sub-Saharan Africa's first digital planetarium, the Naval Hill Planetarium and Boyden Observatory, an astronomical research observatory erected by Harvard University.\nBloemfontein is popularly and poetically known as \"the city of roses\", for its abundance of these flowers and the annual rose festival held there. The city's Sesotho name is Mangaung, meaning \"place of cheetahs\". Its !Orakobab name is \u01c0\u02bcAuxa \u01c3X\u0101s or \u01c0Kx\u02bcauxa \u01c3X\u0101s (Khoekhoegowab spelling: \u01c0Auxa !Kh\u0101s), which refers to Jan Bloem II, known as !X\u0101s-aob or Blumtseb who was a gaokx\u02bcaob (chief) of the \u01c0\u0168di\u01c1\u02bcaes (Springbok Clan) of the !Ora (\"Korana\") nation, whose kraal was the original settlement before the city was built.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe origin of the city's name is disputed. It has been assumed to be from the Dutch words bloem (flower) and fontein (fountain), meaning fountain of flowers. Popular colonial legends include an ox named \"Bloem\" owned by Rudolphus Martinus Brits, one of the pioneer farmers that was taken by a lion near a fountain on his property, while the more likely indigenous history names Jan Bloem II (1775\u20131858), a !Ora (\"Korana\" Khoekhoe) leader who settled there.  His father, Jan Bloem, was a fugitive from the Cape Colony, where he reportedly was escaping arrest after murdering his first wife. Bloem was well known as an expert marksmen, and married into the \u01c0H\u00f5a\u01c1\u02bcaes (Katz clan) and \u01c0\u0168di\u01c1\u02bcaes where he played a role in training !Ora artillery fighters during the first !Ora Wars (a century prior to the second !Ora Wars) on the \u01c2N\u016b!arib (Orange River) in the second half of the 18th century CE. His son was born in 1775 into the Springbok Clan (\u01c0\u0168di\u01c1\u02bcaes), later becoming the kapteijn or chief of this polity.\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThough historically a !Orana settlement, and then a Boer settlement, Bloemfontein was officially founded in 1846 as a fort by British army major Henry Douglas Warden as a British outpost in the Transoranje region, at that stage occupied by various groups of peoples including !Orana (so-called \"Korana\" of the \u01c0H\u00f5a\u01c1\u02bcaes, \u01c0H\u0169di\u01c1\u02bcaes, Eini\u01c1\u02bcaes and others), Cape Colony Trek Boers, Griqua (at that time known as Baasters), and Barolong.\nWarden originally chose the site largely because of its proximity to the main route to Winburg, the spacious open country, and the absence of horse sickness. Bloemfontein was the original farm of Johannes Nicolaas Brits born 21 February 1790, owner and first inhabitant of Bloemfontein. Johann \u2013 as he was known \u2013 sold the farm to Major Warden.With colonial policy shifts, the region changed into the Orange River Sovereignty (1848\u201354) and eventually the Orange Free State Republic (1854\u20131902). From 1902\u201310 it served as the capital of the Orange River Colony and since that time as the provincial capital of the Free State. In 1910 it became the Judicial capital of the Union of South Africa.\n\n\n=== Orange Free State (1854\u20131902) ===\nThe Orange Free State was an independent Boer sovereign republic in southern Africa during the second half of the 19th century. Extending between the Orange and Vaal rivers, its borders were determined by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1848 when the region was proclaimed as the Orange River Sovereignty, with a seat of a British Resident in Bloemfontein.\nAs the capital of the Orange Free State Republic the growth and maturing of the republic resulted in the growth of Bloemfontein. The city constructed numerous public buildings that remain in use today, facilitated by the governance of the republic and compensation from the British for the loss of the diamond rich Griqua Land area. The old Orange Free State's presidential residence the Old Presidency is currently a museum and cultural space in the city.\nA railway line was built in 1890 connecting Bloemfontein to Cape Town.\nThe writer J. R. R. Tolkien was born in the city on 3 January 1892, though his family left Orange Free State (now Free State province, South Africa) following the death of his father, Arthur Tolkien, when Tolkien was three (1895). He recorded that his earliest memories were of \"a hot country\".In 1899 the city was the site of the Bloemfontein Conference, which failed to prevent the outbreak of the Second Boer War. The conference was a final attempt to avert a war between Britain and the South African Republic. With its failure the stage was set for war, which broke out on 11 October 1899.\nThe rail line from Cape Town provided a centrally located railway station, and proved critical to the British in occupying the city later.\nOn 13 March 1900, following the Battle of Paardeberg, British forces captured the city and built a concentration camp nearby to house Boer women and children. The National Women's Monument, on the outskirts of the city, pays homage to the 26,370 women and children as well as 1,421 old men (also 14,154 black people, though some sources feel that the records are unsatisfactory, and that this number could be as high as 20,000) who died in these camps in various parts of the country.The hill in town was named Naval Hill after the naval guns brought in by the British in order to fortify the position against attack.\n\n\n=== Unionisation of South Africa (1910s) ===\nOn 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the Boers signed the Peace Treaty of Vereeniging that ended the Anglo-Boer War between the British Empire and two Boer states, the South African Republic (Republic of Transvaal) and the Orange Free State, South Africa became a Union.Due to disagreements over where the Union's capital should be, a compromise was reached that allowed Bloemfontein to host Appellate Division and become the Union's judicial capital. Bloemfontein was also given financial compensation.On 8 January 1912, the South African Native National Congress (SANNC) was founded in Bloemfontein. The Union of South Africa had not granted rights to black South Africans, causing the organisation's creation. Its primary aim was to fight for the rights of black South Africans.From 1 to 9 January 1914, James Barry Munnik Hertzog and his supporters met in Bloemfontein to form the National Party of the Orange Free State, and to lay down its principles, following Hertzog's exit from the South African Party in 1913. The National Party grew to govern South Africa in 1948 and implement the policy of racial segregation known as apartheid.\n\n\n=== Apartheid era (1948\u20131994) ===\nWhen the National Party won the 1948 South African national government elections they began implementing the policy known as apartheid. The policy was built on white supremacy and racial segregation was implemented. In Bloemfontein, residential segregation had begun in the 19th century with the passing of Ordinance 1 of 1860, which determined that no non-white, without written permission from the landlord, had the right to occupy urban land in towns where local municipalities did not yet exist. On 3 June 1861, the council demarcated three locations in the following areas; the black population was to move to the area which lay to the right of a neighbourhood that was known as Kaffirfontein, Coloureds were to move to the Waaihoek Black residential area on the eastern outskirts of the town. The inhabitants of these settlements had to pay taxes; the so-called hut tax as well as tax on grazing rights. This laid the foundation for the implementation of residential urban segregation as envisaged by the architects of apartheid.\nWhen the South African apartheid government passed the Group Areas Act of 1950, the Bloemfontein municipality put into effect changes in the racial set-up of the city. The municipality demolished the Cape Stands residential area which was occupied by the city's coloured population and moved the residents to Heidedal. However, due to Coloureds living in such close proximity with black people; intermarriages across racial lines occurred, resulting in a partial mixed population in Heidedal and Mangaung. In 1952 the Bloemfontein municipality began building new residential areas for the city's black population. New residential areas to separate ethnic groups such as Sotho, Xhosa and Tswana were formed. The residential areas were jointly known as Mangaung. Phahameng, a Sotho township, was the first formal housing projects to be approved by the municipality in 1956. Physical buffers such as the railway line and roads were put into place to separate black ethnic groups, the white and coloured population.11 000 housing structures, of which approximately 6 000 were government built rental accommodation, were erected in Mangaung between 1952- 1968.In 1968, Mangaung faced serious housing shortages when as many as 3000 to 6000 housing units were needed. To counter this problem, a 55 km east ward expansion called Botshabelo was added in 1979. The Bloemfontein municipality channelled of all black urbanisation to Thaba Nchu and Botshabelo.\nBotshabelo was developed as source of cheap labour for the city of Bloemfontein. A subsidised bus service was established, and Botshabelo was declared decentralisation point. This means that Botshabelo was to become an industrial development point in order to reduce the distance between place of employment and place of residence. In 1988, an approximate 14 500 people were commuting on a daily basis between Botshabelo and Bloemfontein. This meant that 55% of Botshabelo's work force was employed outside the city.In 1994, after the disestablishment of the apartheid government, Bloemfontein, Botshabelo, and Thaba Nchu became part of Motheo District Municipality. The Motheo District Municipality was disestablished on 18 May 2011 and Mangaung was upgraded to become an autonomous metropolitan municipality with Bloemfontein as the main seat.\n\n\n=== Since 1994 ===\nUntil 1994 the city was the sole judicial capital of South Africa. It remains the seat for the Supreme Court of Appeal (formerly the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court). It is also an administrative centre with many private hospitals and educational institutions.\n\n\n== Government ==\nFree State Provincial Government building\nBloemfontein forms part of the Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality, which was upgraded from a Local Municipality in 2011.\nThe Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality elects a municipal council for five-year periods, through a mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) system in which wards elect individual councillors alongside those named from party lists. Voters get two votes: one for a representative to become a ward councillor and the other for a political party. The latter vote is used to distribute seats in the municipal council amongst parties while the former distributes seats through the individual representatives. The current Executive Mayor of Mangaung, Olly Mlamleli, was elected in August 2016.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\nBloemfontein is located in central South Africa on the southern edge of the Highveld at an elevation of 1,400 metres (4,600 ft), bordering on the semi-arid region of the Karoo.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Queen's Fort Military Museum is a museum in Bloemfontein, South Africa, which depicts all major wars in the Free State from the 1800s. The building was erected in 1848 and put to use for the first time in 1849. Along the years, it has been used as military headquarters, a hospital, an asylum or mental institution, and a prison.\n\n\n== Beginning ==\nThe idea to erect this building came after the Battle of Boomplaats (fought near Jagersfontein between the British and the Voortrekker on 28 August 1848). Major Henry Douglas Warden was instructed to build the Fort by Harry Smith to replace Fort Dury, which was situated at the Corner of Markgraaf and St Andrew\u2019s Streets, in Bloemfontein. The building was then named in honour of Queen Victoria, but later changed to The Fort. Currently, it is known as Military Museum.By 6 October 1848, new rampart walls had been built and the Fort was completed the following year. At first, the building was not an impressive one, and it was regarded as ineffective. Four nine-pounder and three six-pounder guns were mounted on the walls. These weapons were regarded as antiquated, obsolete and useless iron guns. Its powder magazine which was mounted inside the Fort, collapsed during heavy rain in 1850. The Fort was managed by two companies of the 45th Regiment, one company of the Cape Corps and 25 artillerymen.After the establishment of the Orange Free State, the building was taken over by Republican forces. After this exercise, the Fort was not used and all efforts to have it maintained were an exercise in futility. When a new Captain - FW Albrecht - was appointed as a commander of the Orange Free State Artillery in 1879, he ensured that the Fort was entirely rebuilt. This is when barracks for soldiers were built (1882), and a stable for horses was also built in 1888. The reconstruction of the Fort then ensued. Convicts from all parts of the Republic were transferred to the Fort to work there. The Fort was then completed in 1892 and the second stable only added in 1896.In 1900, the British again took ownership of the building and parts of it were turned into a military hospital, while the rest served as quarters for the Royal Engineers \u2013 one of the corps for the British Army. On 13 March 1900, the Orange Free State capital surrendered to the British. Lord Roberts then made his formal entrance into Bloemfontein that afternoon. The Coldstream Guards, part of the British Army, then took over the possession of the Fort and it became used as a prison, a hospital and later in 1902, as the headquarters of the South African Constabulary - a para-military body which was established at the end of 1900 with the hope that it would take over from British troops after the war. In 1930, it was taken over by the Union Defence Force and became headquarters of the Free State Command.  On 6 June 1942, it became the headquarters of 23rd Battalion of the National Volunteer Brigade. \n\n\n== The fort as a prison and mental institution ==\nFollowing the 1914-1915 Afrikaner Rebellion (against the South African government\u2019s decision to support Britain in the war against Germany, leaders such as General CR De Wet were held at the Fort, including many of his supporters during their trial. \nIn 1916, the Fort took over the services of Oranje Hospital and was thus used as a mental institution for the criminally insane. David Pratt who shot the then South African Prime Minister \u2013 Hendrik Verwoerd twice at point blank range with a .22 pistol, was incarcerated at the Fort. Pratt was found to not be held criminally liable for shooting the prime minister after reports from five different psychiatrists. On 26 September 1960, he was committed to the Fort where he died a year later in October 1961 \u2013 having committed suicide by hanging himself with a rolled-up bed sheet. \n\n\n== Other uses ==\nIn 1972, the Fort was used as the base of the South African Defence Force and changed its operations into a museum. In 1990, the museum was declared a heritage site under the National Monument Act of 1969. The declaration covers the arched entrance, earth banks and rampart walls, the museum building and land within the rampart walls, the old stable, the canon store and the dwelling house known as Blue Lodge situated on erf 1915. \nIn 1980, the museum fell under the administration of the Orange Free State Provincial Government (Later called Free State Provincial Government). This museum falls under the Department of Sport Arts Culture and Recreation \u2013 Provincial Museums. \n\n\n== Museum exhibitions ==\nThe museum depicts all major military conflicts in the Free State from 1820, as well as the struggle against apartheid. These exhibitions include:\n\nSan and Basotho conflicts\nDifaqane\nThe stories of Mzilikazi of the Matebele\nThe story of Hendrik Potgieter and the Battle of Vegkop (which took place near Heilbron on 16 October 1836)\nThe battle of Swartkoppies (1845) where Adam Kok - with assistance from the British - defeated the Trekboer (this battle took place on 2 May 1845 outside Trompsburg)\nAndries Pretorius - who outstated Major Warden during the battle of Boomplaats (1848).\nThe Battle of Viervoet of 1851 where King Moshoeshoe defeated the allied forces of Korana, Griquas, Barolong and the British under Major Warden.\nThe Battle of Berea (1852)\nThe Battle of Marabeng\nBasotho Wars\nThe First and Second World Wars\nSouth African War - Anglo-Boer War\n1914 Rebellion\nHistory of the liberation movements in South Africa (Umkhonto we Sizwe and Poqo)Tanks and Guns on terrain of the Military Museum\n\nQuick-Firing heavy anti-aircraft gun MK II\nThree-inch Mortar on carriage\nSix-pounder anti-tank gun\nSelf-propelled gun\nField gun MK II\nAnti-tank gun\nQuick-firing light anti-aircraft Bofors gun (x2)\nSherman medium tank M4/105 (FB 247)\nSherman medium tank M4A1 (W) (FB245)\nStuart M3A1 light tank \"honey\" (FB 871 and FB 872)\nEland MK 7/90 armoured car (FB 248)\nArmoured reconnaissance car MK IV\nCombat tank elephant MK 1A (FBN 453)\nNine-pounder muzzle-loader cannon\nFour-pounder mercantile cannon (FB 2141)\n\n\n== See also ==\nBloemfontein\nList of heritage sites in Free State\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttp://www.sahistory.org.za/places/queens-fort-bloemfontein",

The city hosts numerous museums, including the National Women's Monument, the Anglo-Boer War Museum, the National Museum, and the Oliewenhuis Art Museum.\nBloemfontein also host sub-Saharan Africa's first digital planetarium, the Naval Hill Planetarium and Boyden Observatory, an astronomical research observatory erected by Harvard University.\nBloemfontein is popularly and poetically known as \"the city of roses\", for its abundance of these flowers and the annual rose festival held there. The city's Sesotho name is Mangaung, meaning \"place of cheetahs\". Its !Orakobab name is \u01c0\u02bcAuxa \u01c3X\u0101s or \u01c0Kx\u02bcauxa \u01c3X\u0101s (Khoekhoegowab spelling: \u01c0Auxa !Kh\u0101s), which refers to Jan Bloem II, known as !X\u0101s-aob or Blumtseb who was a gaokx\u02bcaob (chief) of the \u01c0\u0168di\u01c1\u02bcaes (Springbok Clan) of the !Ora (\"Korana\") nation, whose kraal was the original settlement before the city was built.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe origin of the city's name is disputed. It has been assumed to be from the Dutch words bloem (flower) and fontein (fountain), meaning fountain of flowers. Popular colonial legends include an ox named \"Bloem\" owned by Rudolphus Martinus Brits, one of the pioneer farmers that was taken by a lion near a fountain on his property, while the more likely indigenous history names Jan Bloem II (1775\u20131858), a !Ora (\"Korana\" Khoekhoe) leader who settled there.  His father, Jan Bloem, was a fugitive from the Cape Colony, where he reportedly was escaping arrest after murdering his first wife. Bloem was well known as an expert marksmen, and married into the \u01c0H\u00f5a\u01c1\u02bcaes (Katz clan) and \u01c0\u0168di\u01c1\u02bcaes where he played a role in training !Ora artillery fighters during the first !Ora Wars (a century prior to the second !Ora Wars) on the \u01c2N\u016b!arib (Orange River) in the second half of the 18th century CE. His son was born in 1775 into the Springbok Clan (\u01c0\u0168di\u01c1\u02bcaes), later becoming the kapteijn or chief of this polity.\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThough historically a !Orana settlement, and then a Boer settlement, Bloemfontein was officially founded in 1846 as a fort by British army major Henry Douglas Warden as a British outpost in the Transoranje region, at that stage occupied by various groups of peoples including !Orana (so-called \"Korana\" of the \u01c0H\u00f5a\u01c1\u02bcaes, \u01c0H\u0169di\u01c1\u02bcaes, Eini\u01c1\u02bcaes and others), Cape Colony Trek Boers, Griqua (at that time known as Baasters), and Barolong.\nWarden originally chose the site largely because of its proximity to the main route to Winburg, the spacious open country, and the absence of horse sickness. Bloemfontein was the original farm of Johannes Nicolaas Brits born 21 February 1790, owner and first inhabitant of Bloemfontein. Johann \u2013 as he was known \u2013 sold the farm to Major Warden.With colonial policy shifts, the region changed into the Orange River Sovereignty (1848\u201354) and eventually the Orange Free State Republic (1854\u20131902). From 1902\u201310 it served as the capital of the Orange River Colony and since that time as the provincial capital of the Free State. In 1910 it became the Judicial capital of the Union of South Africa.\n\n\n=== Orange Free State (1854\u20131902) ===\nThe Orange Free State was an independent Boer sovereign republic in southern Africa during the second half of the 19th century. Extending between the Orange and Vaal rivers, its borders were determined by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1848 when the region was proclaimed as the Orange River Sovereignty, with a seat of a British Resident in Bloemfontein.\nAs the capital of the Orange Free State Republic the growth and maturing of the republic resulted in the growth of Bloemfontein. The city constructed numerous public buildings that remain in use today, facilitated by the governance of the republic and compensation from the British for the loss of the diamond rich Griqua Land area. The old Orange Free State's presidential residence the Old Presidency is currently a museum and cultural space in the city.\nA railway line was built in 1890 connecting Bloemfontein to Cape Town.\nThe writer J. R. R. Tolkien was born in the city on 3 January 1892, though his family left Orange Free State (now Free State province, South Africa) following the death of his father, Arthur Tolkien, when Tolkien was three (1895). He recorded that his earliest memories were of \"a hot country\".In 1899 the city was the site of the Bloemfontein Conference, which failed to prevent the outbreak of the Second Boer War. The conference was a final attempt to avert a war between Britain and the South African Republic. With its failure the stage was set for war, which broke out on 11 October 1899.\nThe rail line from Cape Town provided a centrally located railway station, and proved critical to the British in occupying the city later.\nOn 13 March 1900, following the Battle of Paardeberg, British forces captured the city and built a concentration camp nearby to house Boer women and children. The National Women's Monument, on the outskirts of the city, pays homage to the 26,370 women and children as well as 1,421 old men (also 14,154 black people, though some sources feel that the records are unsatisfactory, and that this number could be as high as 20,000) who died in these camps in various parts of the country.The hill in town was named Naval Hill after the naval guns brought in by the British in order to fortify the position against attack.\n\n\n=== Unionisation of South Africa (1910s) ===\nOn 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the Boers signed the Peace Treaty of Vereeniging that ended the Anglo-Boer War between the British Empire and two Boer states, the South African Republic (Republic of Transvaal) and the Orange Free State, South Africa became a Union.Due to disagreements over where the Union's capital should be, a compromise was reached that allowed Bloemfontein to host Appellate Division and become the Union's judicial capital. Bloemfontein was also given financial compensation.On 8 January 1912, the South African Native National Congress (SANNC) was founded in Bloemfontein. The Union of South Africa had not granted rights to black South Africans, causing the organisation's creation. Its primary aim was to fight for the rights of black South Africans.From 1 to 9 January 1914, James Barry Munnik Hertzog and his supporters met in Bloemfontein to form the National Party of the Orange Free State, and to lay down its principles, following Hertzog's exit from the South African Party in 1913. The National Party grew to govern South Africa in 1948 and implement the policy of racial segregation known as apartheid.\n\n\n=== Apartheid era (1948\u20131994) ===\nWhen the National Party won the 1948 South African national government elections they began implementing the policy known as apartheid. The policy was built on white supremacy and racial segregation was implemented. In Bloemfontein, residential segregation had begun in the 19th century with the passing of Ordinance 1 of 1860, which determined that no non-white, without written permission from the landlord, had the right to occupy urban land in towns where local municipalities did not yet exist. On 3 June 1861, the council demarcated three locations in the following areas; the black population was to move to the area which lay to the right of a neighbourhood that was known as Kaffirfontein, Coloureds were to move to the Waaihoek Black residential area on the eastern outskirts of the town. The inhabitants of these settlements had to pay taxes; the so-called hut tax as well as tax on grazing rights. This laid the foundation for the implementation of residential urban segregation as envisaged by the architects of apartheid.\nWhen the South African apartheid government passed the Group Areas Act of 1950, the Bloemfontein municipality put into effect changes in the racial set-up of the city. The municipality demolished the Cape Stands residential area which was occupied by the city's coloured population and moved the residents to Heidedal. However, due to Coloureds living in such close proximity with black people; intermarriages across racial lines occurred, resulting in a partial mixed population in Heidedal and Mangaung. In 1952 the Bloemfontein municipality began building new residential areas for the city's black population. New residential areas to separate ethnic groups such as Sotho, Xhosa and Tswana were formed. The residential areas were jointly known as Mangaung. Phahameng, a Sotho township, was the first formal housing projects to be approved by the municipality in 1956. Physical buffers such as the railway line and roads were put into place to separate black ethnic groups, the white and coloured population.11 000 housing structures, of which approximately 6 000 were government built rental accommodation, were erected in Mangaung between 1952- 1968.In 1968, Mangaung faced serious housing shortages when as many as 3000 to 6000 housing units were needed. To counter this problem, a 55 km east ward expansion called Botshabelo was added in 1979. The Bloemfontein municipality channelled of all black urbanisation to Thaba Nchu and Botshabelo.\nBotshabelo was developed as source of cheap labour for the city of Bloemfontein. A subsidised bus service was established, and Botshabelo was declared decentralisation point. This means that Botshabelo was to become an industrial development point in order to reduce the distance between place of employment and place of residence. In 1988, an approximate 14 500 people were commuting on a daily basis between Botshabelo and Bloemfontein. This meant that 55% of Botshabelo's work force was employed outside the city.In 1994, after the disestablishment of the apartheid government, Bloemfontein, Botshabelo, and Thaba Nchu became part of Motheo District Municipality. The Motheo District Municipality was disestablished on 18 May 2011 and Mangaung was upgraded to become an autonomous metropolitan municipality with Bloemfontein as the main seat.\n\n\n=== Since 1994 ===\nUntil 1994 the city was the sole judicial capital of South Africa.

Voters get two votes: one for a representative to become a ward councillor and the other for a political party. The latter vote is used to distribute seats in the municipal council amongst parties while the former distributes seats through the individual representatives. The current Executive Mayor of Mangaung, Olly Mlamleli, was elected in August 2016.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\nBloemfontein is located in central South Africa on the southern edge of the Highveld at an elevation of 1,400 metres (4,600 ft), bordering on the semi-arid region of the Karoo.

        "wiki": "Bloemfontein (; Afrikaans: [\u02c8blumf\u0254nt\u025bin]; also known as Bloem) is the capital city of the province of Free State of South Africa; and, as the judicial capital of the nation, one of South Africa's three national capitals (the other two being Cape Town, the legislative capital, and Pretoria, the administrative capital) and is the seventh largest city in South Africa. Situated at an elevation of 1,395 m (4,577 ft) above sea level, the city is home to approximately 520,000 residents and forms part of the Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality which has a population of 747,431. It was one of the host cities for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nThe city of Bloemfontein hosts the Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa, the Franklin Game Reserve, Naval Hill, the Maselspoort Resort and the Sand du Plessis Theatre. The city hosts numerous museums, including the National Women's Monument, the Anglo-Boer War Museum, the National Museum, and the Oliewenhuis Art Museum.\nBloemfontein also host sub-Saharan Africa's first digital planetarium, the Naval Hill Planetarium and Boyden Observatory, an astronomical research observatory erected by Harvard University.\nBloemfontein is popularly and poetically known as \"the city of roses\", for its abundance of these flowers and the annual rose festival held there. The city's Sesotho name is Mangaung, meaning \"place of cheetahs\". Its !Orakobab name is \u01c0\u02bcAuxa \u01c3X\u0101s or \u01c0Kx\u02bcauxa \u01c3X\u0101s (Khoekhoegowab spelling: \u01c0Auxa !Kh\u0101s), which refers to Jan Bloem II, known as !X\u0101s-aob or Blumtseb who was a gaokx\u02bcaob (chief) of the \u01c0\u0168di\u01c1\u02bcaes (Springbok Clan) of the !Ora (\"Korana\") nation, whose kraal was the original settlement before the city was built.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe origin of the city's name is disputed. It has been assumed to be from the Dutch words bloem (flower) and fontein (fountain), meaning fountain of flowers. Popular colonial legends include an ox named \"Bloem\" owned by Rudolphus Martinus Brits, one of the pioneer farmers that was taken by a lion near a fountain on his property, while the more likely indigenous history names Jan Bloem II (1775\u20131858), a !Ora (\"Korana\" Khoekhoe) leader who settled there.  His father, Jan Bloem, was a fugitive from the Cape Colony, where he reportedly was escaping arrest after murdering his first wife. Bloem was well known as an expert marksmen, and married into the \u01c0H\u00f5a\u01c1\u02bcaes (Katz clan) and \u01c0\u0168di\u01c1\u02bcaes where he played a role in training !Ora artillery fighters during the first !Ora Wars (a century prior to the second !Ora Wars) on the \u01c2N\u016b!arib (Orange River) in the second half of the 18th century CE. His son was born in 1775 into the Springbok Clan (\u01c0\u0168di\u01c1\u02bcaes), later becoming the kapteijn or chief of this polity.\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThough historically a !Orana settlement, and then a Boer settlement, Bloemfontein was officially founded in 1846 as a fort by British army major Henry Douglas Warden as a British outpost in the Transoranje region, at that stage occupied by various groups of peoples including !Orana (so-called \"Korana\" of the \u01c0H\u00f5a\u01c1\u02bcaes, \u01c0H\u0169di\u01c1\u02bcaes, Eini\u01c1\u02bcaes and others), Cape Colony Trek Boers, Griqua (at that time known as Baasters), and Barolong.\nWarden originally chose the site largely because of its proximity to the main route to Winburg, the spacious open country, and the absence of horse sickness. Bloemfontein was the original farm of Johannes Nicolaas Brits born 21 February 1790, owner and first inhabitant of Bloemfontein. Johann \u2013 as he was known \u2013 sold the farm to Major Warden.With colonial policy shifts, the region changed into the Orange River Sovereignty (1848\u201354) and eventually the Orange Free State Republic (1854\u20131902). From 1902\u201310 it served as the capital of the Orange River Colony and since that time as the provincial capital of the Free State. In 1910 it became the Judicial capital of the Union of South Africa.\n\n\n=== Orange Free State (1854\u20131902) ===\nThe Orange Free State was an independent Boer sovereign republic in southern Africa during the second half of the 19th century. Extending between the Orange and Vaal rivers, its borders were determined by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1848 when the region was proclaimed as the Orange River Sovereignty, with a seat of a British Resident in Bloemfontein.\nAs the capital of the Orange Free State Republic the growth and maturing of the republic resulted in the growth of Bloemfontein. The city constructed numerous public buildings that remain in use today, facilitated by the governance of the republic and compensation from the British for the loss of the diamond rich Griqua Land area. The old Orange Free State's presidential residence the Old Presidency is currently a museum and cultural space in the city.\nA railway line was built in 1890 connecting Bloemfontein to Cape Town.\nThe writer J. R. R. Tolkien was born in the city on 3 January 1892, though his family left Orange Free State (now Free State province, South Africa) following the death of his father, Arthur Tolkien, when Tolkien was three (1895). He recorded that his earliest memories were of \"a hot country\".In 1899 the city was the site of the Bloemfontein Conference, which failed to prevent the outbreak of the Second Boer War. The conference was a final attempt to avert a war between Britain and the South African Republic. With its failure the stage was set for war, which broke out on 11 October 1899.\nThe rail line from Cape Town provided a centrally located railway station, and proved critical to the British in occupying the city later.\nOn 13 March 1900, following the Battle of Paardeberg, British forces captured the city and built a concentration camp nearby to house Boer women and children. The National Women's Monument, on the outskirts of the city, pays homage to the 26,370 women and children as well as 1,421 old men (also 14,154 black people, though some sources feel that the records are unsatisfactory, and that this number could be as high as 20,000) who died in these camps in various parts of the country.The hill in town was named Naval Hill after the naval guns brought in by the British in order to fortify the position against attack.\n\n\n=== Unionisation of South Africa (1910s) ===\nOn 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the Boers signed the Peace Treaty of Vereeniging that ended the Anglo-Boer War between the British Empire and two Boer states, the South African Republic (Republic of Transvaal) and the Orange Free State, South Africa became a Union.Due to disagreements over where the Union's capital should be, a compromise was reached that allowed Bloemfontein to host Appellate Division and become the Union's judicial capital. Bloemfontein was also given financial compensation.On 8 January 1912, the South African Native National Congress (SANNC) was founded in Bloemfontein. The Union of South Africa had not granted rights to black South Africans, causing the organisation's creation. Its primary aim was to fight for the rights of black South Africans.From 1 to 9 January 1914, James Barry Munnik Hertzog and his supporters met in Bloemfontein to form the National Party of the Orange Free State, and to lay down its principles, following Hertzog's exit from the South African Party in 1913. The National Party grew to govern South Africa in 1948 and implement the policy of racial segregation known as apartheid.\n\n\n=== Apartheid era (1948\u20131994) ===\nWhen the National Party won the 1948 South African national government elections they began implementing the policy known as apartheid. The policy was built on white supremacy and racial segregation was implemented. In Bloemfontein, residential segregation had begun in the 19th century with the passing of Ordinance 1 of 1860, which determined that no non-white, without written permission from the landlord, had the right to occupy urban land in towns where local municipalities did not yet exist. On 3 June 1861, the council demarcated three locations in the following areas; the black population was to move to the area which lay to the right of a neighbourhood that was known as Kaffirfontein, Coloureds were to move to the Waaihoek Black residential area on the eastern outskirts of the town. The inhabitants of these settlements had to pay taxes; the so-called hut tax as well as tax on grazing rights. This laid the foundation for the implementation of residential urban segregation as envisaged by the architects of apartheid.\nWhen the South African apartheid government passed the Group Areas Act of 1950, the Bloemfontein municipality put into effect changes in the racial set-up of the city. The municipality demolished the Cape Stands residential area which was occupied by the city's coloured population and moved the residents to Heidedal. However, due to Coloureds living in such close proximity with black people; intermarriages across racial lines occurred, resulting in a partial mixed population in Heidedal and Mangaung. In 1952 the Bloemfontein municipality began building new residential areas for the city's black population. New residential areas to separate ethnic groups such as Sotho, Xhosa and Tswana were formed. The residential areas were jointly known as Mangaung. Phahameng, a Sotho township, was the first formal housing projects to be approved by the municipality in 1956. Physical buffers such as the railway line and roads were put into place to separate black ethnic groups, the white and coloured population.11 000 housing structures, of which approximately 6 000 were government built rental accommodation, were erected in Mangaung between 1952- 1968.In 1968, Mangaung faced serious housing shortages when as many as 3000 to 6000 housing units were needed. To counter this problem, a 55 km east ward expansion called Botshabelo was added in 1979. The Bloemfontein municipality channelled of all black urbanisation to Thaba Nchu and Botshabelo.\nBotshabelo was developed as source of cheap labour for the city of Bloemfontein. A subsidised bus service was established, and Botshabelo was declared decentralisation point. This means that Botshabelo was to become an industrial development point in order to reduce the distance between place of employment and place of residence. In 1988, an approximate 14 500 people were commuting on a daily basis between Botshabelo and Bloemfontein. This meant that 55% of Botshabelo's work force was employed outside the city.In 1994, after the disestablishment of the apartheid government, Bloemfontein, Botshabelo, and Thaba Nchu became part of Motheo District Municipality. The Motheo District Municipality was disestablished on 18 May 2011 and Mangaung was upgraded to become an autonomous metropolitan municipality with Bloemfontein as the main seat.\n\n\n=== Since 1994 ===\nUntil 1994 the city was the sole judicial capital of South Africa. It remains the seat for the Supreme Court of Appeal (formerly the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court). It is also an administrative centre with many private hospitals and educational institutions.\n\n\n== Government ==\nFree State Provincial Government building\nBloemfontein forms part of the Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality, which was upgraded from a Local Municipality in 2011.\nThe Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality elects a municipal council for five-year periods, through a mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) system in which wards elect individual councillors alongside those named from party lists. Voters get two votes: one for a representative to become a ward councillor and the other for a political party. The latter vote is used to distribute seats in the municipal council amongst parties while the former distributes seats through the individual representatives. The current Executive Mayor of Mangaung, Olly Mlamleli, was elected in August 2016.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\nBloemfontein is located in central South Africa on the southern edge of the Highveld at an elevation of 1,400 metres (4,600 ft), bordering on the semi-arid region of the Karoo.

Each of the thirty or so tombstones of these pioneer families has been completely transcribed.\nSouth Park: This cemetery was consecrated in 1978 and now includes more than 10 000 graves and is the biggest cemetery in the Free State.On 7 October 2010, Several tombstones in the Jewish cemetery in Bloemfontein were defaced with swastikas and antisemitic graffiti.\nOn 10 April 2012, Bloemfontein's historic Memorium cemetery was vandalized, with 35 tombstones toppled and obscene graffiti daubed on the walls of the adjoining Ohel. The graffiti included images of money bags and diamonds, as well as of a crudely drawn Magen David, allegedly as part of an anti-Semitic act.\nThere is also the old Phahameng cemetery which dates back to the 1960s and was specifically reserved for Africans during the apartheid era and has a Heroes Acre, where freedom fighters are laid to rest.\nThe Heide Heights cemetery in Heidedal was reserved for coloured people during the apartheid era but all races could bury their dead after 1994. This cemetery has been closed due to it being full.\n\n\n== Community service organisations ==\nRound Table 158 Bloemfontein The first Round Table was formed in Norwich, England in 1927. The founder, Louis Marchesi, was a young member of Norwich Rotary Club who felt a need existed for a club where the young business men of the town could gather on a regular basis. At their meetings they could exchange ideas, learn from the experiences of their colleagues and play a collective part in the civic life of Norwich. From a very early stage it was agreed that Round Table would be a non-religious, non-political club and this has continued to this day.\nChild Welfare Bloemfontein Child Welfare Bloemfontein & Childline Free State is a non-profit organisation that was founded in 1914 by a group of volunteers who identified a need for welfare services among the community. In 2004, Child Welfare Bloemfontein celebrated its 90th birthday. Over the past 90 years, many community programmes have been successfully implemented.\nFreeMasons The Masonic Centre, Bloemfontein, was built during the 1970s when all the Masonic Lodges in Bloemfontein, sold their individual properties. The Centre was erected to facilitate all Masonic activities in Bloemfontein and surrounding areas. All four Constitutions that is active in South Africa, gather at the Centre. The Lodges that has ownership of the Centre is Lodge Unie (est. 1864); the Rising Star Lodge (est. 1865); Thistle Lodge (est.1903); Emerald Lodge (est. 1905); Lodge Dagbreek (est. 1932) & Lodge Oranje (est. 1964). Various side degrees are catered for at the Centre which includes the Mark, Ark, the Royal Arch & Rose Croix. Bloemfontein has a rich Masonic history especially in the Anglo Boer War (1899\u20131902), with members such as Lord Kitchener, Rudyard Kipling and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, visiting Lodges in Bloemfontein.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Sister cities ===\n Nanjing, China\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBloemfontein The official Mangaung Local Municipality website\n \"Bloemfontein\" .

          "This is your typical casino that has everything one would expect: Gambling area, games area for children, general chain restaurants (Spur, Wimpy, Ocean basket), ten pin bowling, entertainment bar, hotel. Nothing more, nothing less. Karaoke night at the entertainment bar is fun,",
          "I'm not one for gambling and casinos, but I've been to casinos where there's quite a lot to offer even if you're not gambling. Proper entertainment events are too few and too far apart. The restaurants are nothing special. If you want to hang out with friends or family, take",

          "Great night out. Quite busy and full of serious gamblers that are trying to win back the thousands they have lost. If you enjoy a flutter of roulette you are sure to love it. The western bar is cool too. Secure parking a bonus. Good choice of drinks.",
          "As casino's go this must be the one most obviously built just for gamblers. There are no decent restaurants to speak of unless you rate a Spur as one and the \"entertainment\" is in the only bar available and while the dancers no doubt try very hard the singing, choreography and",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Old Presidency or Ou Presidensie (Afrikaans) is a museum, art gallery and theatre in the city of Bloemfontein, South Africa, located on President Brand Street in the heart of the city. The former residence of the President of the Republic of the Orange Free State from 1886 until 1899 when the city fell to the British Empire during the Second Anglo-Boer War.\n\n\n== History ==\nA trekboer family with the surname of Brits settled on the site in the 1820s and built a thatched A-frame dwelling for themselves.  Major Henry Douglas Warden (then the British resident for the area north of the Orange River) purchased it from the Brits family in 1846. The thatched-house built by the Brits family was demolished and the house he (Warden) erected began as a small farm building which was made out of sun-dried bricks. It is referred to as a 'nederige kleihuis' (Afrikaans for humble clay-house). In 1854, The British Government abandoned the Orange River Sovereignty and the Boer Republic then took over the residence.  This independence saw the new presidents of the republic take up quarters in the \"Residency\", reportedly Presidents Josias Philip Hoffman, Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff and Marthinus Wessel Pretorius.  They all lived in the dwelling during their terms in office. In 1860, the Volksraad (The parliament of the former Orange Free State Republic, which existed from 1857 to 1902) approved plans for a new Presidency house. At that time, the Volksraad could only afford \u00a3800 for the restoration of the old residency. Additional repairs were carried out in 1864 and 1874.In the early 1880s the Volksraad decided that the cost of maintenance was unfeasible and that the building was no longer suitable as the official residence of the head of state of an independent country. Thus in 1882 President Johannes Brand submitted plans for a competition to design the 'new' Presidency to the Volksraad. There were in total 27 proposals submitted in 1884 for the prize money of \u00a3100. An international architectural competition was held and won by English architects \u2013 Lennox Canning and F Goad of Canning & Goad Architects.   The construction of the building was budgeted at \u00a310,000, but the design submitted by Canning was too sophisticated and even after being asked to simplify their design, it still amounted to \u00a312, 200. With some reluctance, this was accepted. The excavation of new foundations for the new building was deemed too costly, subsequently it was decided to build the new building on the foundation of the old one. .Construction started on 22 May 1885, when the foundation stone was laid, and the building was completed in 1886 with President Brand taking up quarters until his death in 1888. Presidents F.W. Reitz (1888\u201395) and M.T. Steyn (1896-1900) also resided in the building until the British occupation of Bloemfontein on 13 March 1900 when the building served as the headquarters of Field-Marshal Lord Roberts during the Second Anglo-Boer War.\n\n\n== Other uses of the Presidency ==\nAfter the British captured Bloemfontein on 13 March 1900, the building became known as the Government House and was occupied by Lord Roberts and his officers; and later by Sir Hamilton J Goold-Adams (1901-1910) who was the Lieutenant-Governor of the Orange River Colony.  During the time of Goold-Adams, the architect Sir Herbert Baker made some additions to the Presidency and also added the stables to the back of the house. \nAlong the years, the Presidency served as the following: \n\nAnnexe for Eunice School\nHeadquarters for the Orange Free State Command\nHostel for Normal College students\nOffices for Free State Library Services\nVenue for Performing Arts Centre of the Free State (PACOFS)  \n\n\n== Haunting ==\nThe stables at the back of the building are thought to be haunted with several reports of people hearing carriages moving into the stables. The premises reportedly house the ghost of a dog with many people hearing ephemeral barking at night. There are also many stories of children being spotted within the building due to the buildings tenure as a school and hostel.\n\n\n== Declaration status and Museum ==\nThe building was restored from 1973 to 1983. The museum mainly focuses on the lives and history of the three heads of state (Brand, Reitz and Steyn) during their respective terms of office. This site was originally declared a national monument on 27 January 1938 and later revised 15 December 1989 to the following:\n\nSiteReference: 9/2/302/0007\nDeclarationType: Provincial Heritage Site\nGazetteNo: 12214\nGazette Date: Friday, December 15, 1989\nNoticeNo: 2709.Notice\nDate: Friday, December 15, 1989.\nDescription The property, together with the Old Presidency thereon situated in President Brand Street, Bloemfontein, being certain Consolidated Erf 24722, situated in the city of Bloemfontein, District of Bloemfontein, in extent 3, 0586 hectares.The museum has other attractions including \"art exhibitions, musical events and theatrical productions\" and the gardens outside prove to be a popular site for photography.

        "wiki": "The Orange Free State (Dutch: Oranje Vrijstaat, Afrikaans: Oranje-Vrystaat, abbreviated as OVS) was an independent Boer sovereign republic in Southern Africa during the second half of the 19th century, which ceased to exist after it was defeated and surrendered to the British Empire at the end of the Second Boer War in 1902. It is the historical precursor to the present-day Free State province.Extending between the Orange and Vaal rivers, its borders were determined by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1848 when the region was proclaimed as the Orange River Sovereignty, with a British Resident based in Bloemfontein. Bloemfontein and the southern parts of the Sovereignty had previously been settled by Griqua and by Trekboere from the Cape Colony.\nThe Voortrekker Republic of Natalia, founded in 1837, administered the northern part of the territory through a landdrost based at Winburg. This northern area was later in federation with the Republic of Potchefstroom which eventually formed part of the South African Republic (Transvaal).Following the granting of sovereignty to the Transvaal Republic, the British recognised the independence of the Orange River Sovereignty and the country officially became independent as the Orange Free State on 23 February 1854, with the signing of the Orange River Convention. The new republic incorporated the Orange River Sovereignty and continued the traditions of the Winburg-Potchefstroom Republic.The Orange Free State developed into a politically and economically successful republic and for the most part enjoyed good relationships with its neighbours. It was annexed as the Orange River Colony in 1900. It ceased to exist as an independent Boer republic on 31 May 1902 with the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging at the conclusion of the Second Boer War. Following a period of direct rule by the British, it attained self-government in 1907 and joined the Union of South Africa in 1910 as the Orange Free State Province, along with the Cape Province, Natal, and the Transvaal. In 1961, the Union of South Africa became the Republic of South Africa.The republic's name derives partly from the Orange River, which in turn was named in honour of the Dutch ruling family, the House of Orange, by the Dutch explorer Robert Jacob Gordon. The official language in the Orange Free State was Dutch.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Before the Voortrekkers ===\nEuropeans first visited the country north of the Orange River towards the close of the 18th century. One of the most notable visitors was the Dutch explorer Robert Jacob Gordon, who mapped the region and gave the Orange River its name. At that time, the population was sparse. The majority of the inhabitants appear to have been members of the Sotho people (colonial form Basuto), but in the valleys of the Orange and Vaal were Korana and other Khoikhoi, and in the Drakensberg and on the western border lived numbers of Bushmen. Early in the 19th century Griqua established themselves north of the Orange.\n\n\n=== Boer immigration ===\nIn 1824 farmers of Dutch, French Huguenot and German descent known as Voortrekkers (later named Boers by the English) emerged from the Cape Colony, seeking pasture for their flocks and to escape British governmental oversight, settling in the country. Up to this time the few Europeans who had crossed the Orange had come mainly as hunters or as missionaries. These early migrants were followed in 1836 by the first parties of the Great Trek. These emigrants left the Cape Colony for various reasons, but all shared the desire for independence from British authority. The leader of the first large party, Hendrik Potgieter, concluded an agreement with Makwana, the chief of the Bataung tribe of Batswana, ceding to the farmers the country between the Vet and Vaal rivers. When Boer families first reached the area they discovered that the country had been devastated, in the northern parts by the chief Mzilikazi and his Matabele in what was known as the Mfecane, and also by the Difaqane, in which three tribes roamed across the land attacking settled groups, absorbing them and their resources until they collapsed because of their sheer size. Consequently, large areas were depopulated. The Boers soon came into collision with Mzilikazi's raiding parties, which attacked Boer hunters who crossed the Vaal River. Reprisals followed, and in November 1837 the Boers decisively defeated Mzilikazi, who thereupon fled northward and eventually established himself on the site of the future Bulawayo in Zimbabwe.In the meantime another party of Cape Dutch emigrants had settled at Thaba Nchu, where the Wesleyans had a mission station for the Barolong. These Barolong had trekked from their original home under their chief, Moroka II, first south-westwards to the Langberg, and then eastwards to Thaba Nchu. The emigrants were treated with great kindness by Moroka, and with the Barolong the Boers maintained uniformly friendly relations after they defeated Mzilikazi. In December 1836 the emigrants beyond the Orange drew up in general assembly an elementary republican form of government. After the defeat of Mzilikazi the town of Winburg (so named by the Boers in commemoration of their victory) was founded, a Volksraad elected, and Piet Retief, one of the ablest of the Voortrekkers, chosen \u201cgovernor and commandant-general\u201d. The emigrants already numbered some 500 men, besides women and children and many servants. Dissensions speedily arose among the emigrants, whose numbers were constantly added to, and Retief, Potgieter and other leaders crossed the Drakensberg and entered Natal. Those that remained were divided into several parties.\n\n\n=== British rule ===\nMeanwhile, a new power had arisen along the upper Orange and in the valley of the Caledon. Moshoeshoe, a minor Basotho chief, had welded together a number of scattered and broken clans which had sought refuge in that mountainous region after fleeing from Mzilikazi, and had formed the Basotho nation which acknowledged him as king. In 1833 he had welcomed as workers among his people a band of French Protestant missionaries, and as the Boer immigrants began to settle in his neighborhood he decided to seek support from the British at the Cape. At that time the British government was not prepared to exercise control over the immigrants. Acting upon the advice of Dr John Philip, the superintendent of the London Missionary Society\u2019s stations in South Africa, a treaty was concluded in 1843 with Moshoeshoe, placing him under British protection. A similar treaty was made with the Griqua chief Adam Kok III. By these treaties, which recognised native sovereignty over large areas on which Boer farmers were settled, the British sought to keep a check on the Boers and to protect both the natives and Cape Colony. The effect was to precipitate collisions between all three parties.The year in which the treaty with Moshoeshoe was made, several large parties of Boers recrossed the Drakensberg into the country north of the Orange, refusing to remain in Natal when the British annexed the newly formed Boer republic of Natalia to form the Colony of Natal. During their stay in Natal the Boers inflicted a severe defeat on the Zulus under Dingane in the Battle of Blood River in December 1838, which, following on the flight of Mzilikazi, greatly strengthened the position of Moshoeshoe, whose power became a menace to that of the Boer farmers. Trouble first arose, however, between the Boers and the Griqua in the Philippolis district. Some of the Boer farmers in this district, unlike their fellows dwelling farther north, were willing to accept British rule. This fact induced Mr Justice Menzies, one of the judges of Cape Colony then on circuit at Colesberg, to cross the Orange and proclaim the country British territory in October 1842. The proclamation was disallowed by the governor, Sir George Napier, who, nevertheless, maintained that the Boer farmers remained British subjects. After this episode the British negotiated their treaties with Adam Kok III and Moshoeshoe.The treaties gave great offence to the Boers, who refused to acknowledge the sovereignty of the native chiefs. The majority of the Boer farmers in Kok's territory sent a deputation to the British commissioner in Natal, Henry Cloete, asking for equal treatment with the Griquas, and expressing the desire to come under British protection under such terms. Shortly afterwards hostilities between the farmers and the Griqua broke out. British troops moved up to support the Griquas, and after a skirmish at Zwartkopjes (2 May 1845) a new arrangement was made between Kok and Peregrine Maitland, then governor of Cape Colony, virtually placing the administration of his territory in the hands of a British resident, a post filled in 1846 by Captain Henry Douglas Warden. The place purchased by Captain (afterwards Major) Warden as the seat of his court was known as Bloemfontein, and it subsequently became the capital of the whole country. Bloemfontein lay to the south of the region settled by Voortrekkers.\n\n\n=== Boer governance ===\nThe Volksraad at Winburg during this period continued to claim jurisdiction over the Boers living between the Orange and the Vaal and was in federation with the Volksraad at Potchefstroom, which made a similar claim upon the Great Boers living north of the Vaal. In 1846 Major Warden occupied Winburg for a short time, and the relations between the Boers and the British were in a continual state of tension. Many of the farmers deserted Winburg for the Transvaal. Sir Harry Smith became governor of the Cape at the end of 1847. He recognised the failure of the attempt to govern on the lines of the treaties with the Griquas and Basotho, and on 3 February 1848 he issued a proclamation declaring British sovereignty over the country between the Orange and the Vaal eastward to the Drakensberg. Sir Harry Smith's popularity among the Boers gained for his policy considerable support, but the republican party, at whose head was Andries Pretorius, did not submit without a struggle. They were, however, defeated by Sir Harry Smith in the Battle of Boomplaats on 29 August 1848. Thereupon Pretorius, with those most bitterly opposed to British rule, retreated across the Vaal.\n\n\n=== Orange River Sovereignty ===\n\nIn March 1849 Major Warden was succeeded at Bloemfontein as civil commissioner by Mr C. U. Stuart, but he remained the British resident until July 1852. A nominated legislative council was created, a high court established and other steps taken for the orderly government of the country, which was officially styled the Orange River Sovereignty. In October 1849 Moshoeshoe was induced to sign a new arrangement considerably curtailing the boundaries of the Basotho reserve. The frontier towards the Sovereignty was thereafter known as the Warden line. A little later the reserves of other chieftains were precisely defined.The British Resident had, however, no force sufficient to maintain his authority, and Moshoeshoe and all the neighboring clans became involved in hostilities with one another and with the Europeans. In 1851 Moshoeshoe joined the republican party in the Sovereignty in an invitation to Pretorius to recross the Vaal. The intervention of Pretorius resulted in the Sand River Convention of 1852, which acknowledged the independence of the Transvaal but left the status of the Sovereignty untouched. The British government (under the first Russell administration), which had reluctantly agreed to the annexation of the country, had, however, already repented its decision and had resolved to abandon the Sovereignty. Lord Henry Grey, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, in a dispatch to Sir Harry Smith dated 21 October 1851, declared, \"The ultimate abandonment of the Orange Sovereignty should be a settled point in our policy.\"A meeting of representatives of all European inhabitants of the Sovereignty, elected on manhood suffrage, held at Bloemfontein in June 1852, nevertheless declared in favour of the retention of British rule. At the close of that year a settlement was at length concluded with Moshoeshoe, which left, perhaps, that chief in a stronger position than he had hitherto been. There had been ministerial changes in England and the Aberdeen ministry, then in power, adhered to the determination to withdraw from the Sovereignty. Sir George Russell Clerk was sent out in 1853 as special commissioner \"for the settling and adjusting of the affairs\" of the Sovereignty, and in August of that year he summoned a meeting of delegates to determine upon a form of self-government.At that time there were some 15,000 Europeans in the country, many of them recent immigrants from Cape Colony. There were among them numbers of farmers and tradesmen of British descent. The majority of the whites still wished for the continuance of British rule provided that it was effective and the country guarded against its enemies. The representations of their delegates, who drew up a proposed constitution retaining British control, were unavailing. Sir George Clerk announced that, as the elected delegates were unwilling to take steps to form an independent government, he would enter into negotiations with other persons. \" And then,\" wrote George McCall Theal, \"was seen forced the strange spectacle of an English commissioner addressing men who wished to be free of British control as the friendly and well-disposed inhabitants, while for those who desired to remain British subjects and who claimed that protection to which they believed themselves entitled he had no sympathising word.\" While the elected delegates sent two members to England to try and induce the government to alter their decision, Sir George Clerk speedily came to terms with a committee formed by the republican party and presided over by Mr J. H. Hoffman. Even before this committee met a royal proclamation had been signed (30 January 1854) \"abandoning and renouncing all dominion\" in the Sovereignty.The Orange River Convention, recognising the independence of the country, was signed at Bloemfontein on 23 February by Sir George Clerk and the republican committee, and in March the Boer government assumed office and the republican flag was hoisted. Five days later the representatives of the elected delegates had an interview in London with the colonial secretary, the Duke of Newcastle, who informed them that it was now too late to discuss the question of the retention of British rule. The colonial secretary added that it was impossible for England to supply troops to constantly advancing outposts, \"especially as Cape Town and the port of Table Bay were all she really required in South Africa.\" In withdrawing from the Sovereignty the British government declared that it had \"no alliance with any native chief or tribes to the northward of the Orange River with the exception of the Griqua chief Captain Adam Kok [III]\". Kok was not formidable in a military sense, nor could he prevent individual Griquas from alienating their lands. Eventually, in 1861, he sold his sovereign rights to the Free State for \u00a34000 and moved with his followers to the district later known as Griqualand East.On the abandonment of British rule, representatives of the people were elected and met at Bloemfontein on 28 March 1854, and between then and 18 April were engaged in framing a constitution. The country was declared a republic and named the Orange Free State. All persons of European blood possessing a six months' residential qualification were to be granted full burgher rights. The sole legislative authority was vested in a single popularly elected chamber of the Volksraad. Executive authority was entrusted to a president elected by the burghers from a list submitted by the Volksraad. The president was to be assisted by an executive council, was to hold office for five years and was eligible for re-election. The constitution was subsequently modified but remained of a liberal character. A residence of five years in the country was required before aliens could become naturalised. The first president was Josias Philip Hoffman, but he was accused of being too complaisant towards Moshoeshoe and resigned, being succeeded in 1855 by Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff, one of the voortrekkers, who had previously taken an active part in the affairs of the Natalia Republic.\n\n\n=== Conflict with the South African Republic ===\n\nDistracted among themselves, with the formidable Basotho power on their southern and eastern flank, the troubles of the infant state were speedily added to by the action of the Transvaal Boers of the South African Republic. Marthinus Pretorius, who had succeeded to his father's position as commandant general of Potchefstroom, wished to bring about a confederation between the two Boer states. Peaceful overtures from Pretorius were declined, and some of his partisans in the Free State were accused of treason in February 1857. Thereupon Pretorius, aided by Paul Kruger, conducted a raid into the Free State territory. On learning of the invasion President Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff proclaimed martial law throughout the country. The majority of the burghers rallied to his support, and on 25 May the two opposing forces faced one another on the banks of the Rhenoster. President Boshoff not only got together some 800 men within the Free State, but he received offers of support from Commandant Stephanus Schoeman, the Transvaal leader in the Zoutpansberg district and from Commandant Joubert of Lydenburg. Pretorius and Kruger, realising that they would have to sustain attack from both north and south, abandoned their enterprise. Their force, too, only amounted to some three hundred. Kruger came to Boshoff's camp with a flag of truce, the \"army\" of Pretorius returned north and on 2 June a treaty of peace was signed, each state acknowledging the absolute independence of the other.The conduct of Pretorius was stigmatised as \"blameworthy.\" Several of the malcontents in the Free State who had joined Pretorius permanently settled in the Transvaal, and other Free Staters who had been guilty of high treason were arrested and punished. This experience did not, however, heal the party strife within the Free State. In consequence of the dissensions among the burghers President Boshoff tendered his resignation in February 1858, but was for a time induced to remain in office. The difficulties of the state were at that time so great that the Volksraad in December 1858 passed a resolution in favor of confederation with the Cape Colony. This proposition received the strong support of Sir George Grey, then governor of Cape Colony, but his view did not commend itself to the British government, and was not adopted.In the same year, the disputes between the Basotho and the Boers culminated in open war. Both parties laid claims to land beyond the Warden line, and each party had taken possession of what it could, the Basotho being also expert cattle-lifters. In the war the advantage rested with the Basotho; thereupon the Free State appealed to Sir George Grey, who induced Moshoeshoe to come to terms. On 15 October 1858, a treaty was signed defining the new boundary. The peace was nominal only, while the burghers were also involved in disputes with other tribes. Mr. Boshoff again tendered his resignation in February 1859 and retired to Natal. Many of the burghers would have at this time welcomed union with the Transvaal, but learning from Sir George Grey that such a union would nullify the conventions of 1852 and 1854 and necessitate the reconsideration of Great Britain's policy towards the native tribes north of the Orange and Vaal rivers, the project was dropped. Commandant Marthinus Wessel Pretorius was, however, elected president in place of Mr Boshoff. Though unable to effect a durable peace with the Basotho, or to realise his ambition for the creation of one powerful Boer republic, Pretorius saw the Free State begin to grow in strength. The fertile district of Bethulie as well as Adam Kok's territory was acquired, and there was a considerable increase in the Boer population. The burghers generally, however, had little confidence in their elected rulers and little desire for taxes to be levied. Wearied like Mr Boshoff, and more interested in affairs in the Transvaal than in those of the Free State, Pretorius resigned the presidency in 1863.After an interval of seven months, Johannes Brand, an advocate at the Cape bar, was elected president. He assumed office in February 1864. His election proved a turning-point in the history of the country, which, under his guidance, became peaceful and prosperous. But before peace could be established an end had to be made of the difficulties with the Basothos. Moshoeshoe continued to menace the Free State border. Attempts at accommodation made by the governor of Cape Colony, Sir Philip Wodehouse, failed, and war between the Free State and Moshoeshoe was renewed in 1865. The Boers gained considerable successes, and this induced Moshoeshoe to sue for peace. The terms exacted were, however, too harsh for a nation yet unbroken to accept permanently. A treaty was signed at Thaba Bosiu in April 1866, but war again broke out in 1867, and the Free State attracted to its side a large number of adventurers from all parts of South Africa. The burghers thus reinforced gained at length a decisive victory over their great antagonist, every stronghold in Basutoland save Thaba Bosiu being stormed. Moshoeshoe now turned to Sir Philip Wodehouse for preservation. His call was heeded, and in 1868 he and his country were taken under British protection. Thus the thirty years' strife between the Basothos and the Boers came to an end. The intervention of the governor of Cape Colony led to the conclusion of the treaty of Aliwal North (12 February 1869), which defined the borders between the Orange Free State and Basutoland. The country lying to the north of the Orange River and west of the Caledon River, formerly a part of Basutoland, was ceded to the Free State, and became known as the Conquered Territory.A year after the addition of the Conquered Territory to the state another boundary dispute was settled by the arbitration of Robert William Keate, lieutenant-governor of Natal. By the Sand River Convention, independence had been granted to the Boers living \"north of the Vaal\", and the dispute turned on the question as to what stream constituted the true upper course of that river. Mr Keate decided on 19 February 1870 against the Free State view and fixed the Klip River as the dividing line, the Transvaal thus securing the Wakkerstroom and adjacent districts.\n\n\n=== Diamonds discovered ===\nThe Basutoland difficulties were no sooner arranged than the Free Staters found themselves confronted with a serious difficulty on their western border. In the years 1870\u20131871 a large number of foreign diggers had settled on the diamond fields near the junction of the Vaal and Orange rivers, which were situated in part on land claimed by the Griqua chief Nicholas Waterboer and by the Free State.The Free State established a temporary government over the diamond fields, but the administration of this body was satisfactory neither to the Free State nor to the diggers. At this juncture Waterboer offered to place the territory under the administration of Queen Victoria. The offer was accepted, and on 27 October 1871 the district, together with some adjacent territory to which the Transvaal had laid claim, was proclaimed, under the name of Griqualand West, British territory. Waterboer's claims were based on the treaty concluded by his father with the British in 1834, and on various arrangements with the Kok chiefs; the Free State based its claim on its purchase of Adam Kok's sovereign rights and on long occupation. The difference between proprietorship and sovereignty was confused or ignored. That Waterboer exercised no authority in the disputed district was admitted. When the British annexation took place a party in the Volksraad wished to go to war with Britain, but the counsels of President Johannes Brand prevailed. The Free State, however, did not abandon its claims. The matter involved no little irritation between the parties concerned until July 1876. It was then disposed of by Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon, at that time Secretary of State for the Colonies, who granted to the Free State a \u00a390,000 payment \"in full satisfaction of all claims which it considers it may possess to Griqualand West.\" Lord Carnarvon declined to entertain the proposal made by Mr Brand that the territory should be given up by Great Britain. In the opinion of historian George McCall Theal, the annexation of Griqualand West was probably in the best interests of the Free State. \"There was,\" he stated, \"no alternative from British sovereignty other than an independent diamond field republic.\"At this time, largely owing to the struggle with the Basothos, the Free State Boers, like their Transvaal neighbors, had drifted into financial straits. A paper currency had been instituted, and the notes, known as \"bluebacks\", soon dropped to less than half their nominal value. Commerce was largely carried on by barter, and many cases of bankruptcy occurred in the state. The influx of British and other immigrants to the diamond fields, in the early 1870s, restored public credit and individual prosperity to the Boers of the Free State. The diamond fields offered a ready market for stock and other agricultural produce. Money flowed into the pockets of the farmers. Public credit was restored. \"Bluebacks\" recovered par value, and were called in and redeemed by the government. Valuable diamond mines were also discovered within the Free State, of which the one at Jagersfontein was the richest. Capital from Kimberley and London was soon provided with which to work them.\n\n\n=== Peaceful relations with neighbours ===\nThe relations between the British and the Free State, after the question of the boundary was settled, remained perfectly amicable down to the outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899. From 1870 onward the history of the state was one of quiet, steady progress. At the time of the first annexation of the Transvaal the Free State declined Lord Carnarvon's invitation to federate with the other South African communities. In 1880, when a rising of the Boers in the Transvaal was threatening, President Brand showed every desire to avert the conflict. He suggested that Sir Henry de Villiers, Chief Justice of Cape Colony, should be sent into the Transvaal to endeavour to gauge the true state of affairs in that country. This suggestion was not acted upon, but when war broke out in the Transvaal, Brand declined to take any part in the struggle. In spite of the neutral attitude taken by their government a number of the Free State Boers, living in the northern part of the country, went to the Transvaal and joined their brethren then in arms against the British. This fact was not allowed to influence the friendly relations between the Free State and Great Britain. In 1888 Sir Johannes Brand died.\n\nDuring the period of Brand's presidency a great change, both political and economic, had come over South Africa. The renewal of the policy of British expansion had been answered by the formation of the Afrikaner Bond, which represented the aspirations of the Afrikaner people, and had active branches in the Free State. This alteration in the political outlook was accompanied, and in part occasioned, by economic changes of great significance. The development of the diamond mines and of the gold and coal industries \u2014 of which Brand saw the beginning \u2014 had far-reaching consequences, bringing the Boer republics into contact with the new industrial era. The Free Staters, under Brand's rule, had shown considerable ability to adapt their policy to meet the altered situation. In 1889 an agreement made between the Free State and the Cape Colony government, whereby the latter was empowered to extend, at its own cost, its railway system to Bloemfontein. The Free State retained the right to purchase this extension at cost, a right it exercised after the Jameson Raid.Having accepted the assistance of the Cape government in constructing its railway, the state also in 1889 entered into a Customs Union Convention with them. The convention was the outcome of a conference held at Cape Town in 1888, at which delegates from Natal, the Free State and the Cape Colony attended. Natal at this time had not seen its way to entering the Customs Union, but did so at a later date.\n\n\n=== Renewal of hostilities ===\nIn January 1889 Francis William Reitz was elected president of the Free State. Reitz had no sooner got into office than a meeting was arranged with Paul Kruger, president of the South African Republic, at which various terms were discussed and decided upon regarding an agreement dealing with the railways, terms of a treaty of amity and commerce, and what was called a political treaty. The political treaty referred in general terms to a federal union between the South African Republic and the Orange Free State, and bound each of them to help the other, whenever the independence of either should be assailed or threatened from without, unless the state so called upon for assistance should be able to show the injustice of the cause of quarrel in which the other state had engaged. While thus committed to an alliance with its northern neighbour no change was made in internal administration. The Free State, in fact, from its geographical position reaped the benefits without incurring the anxieties consequent on the settlement of a large Uitlander population on the Witwatersrand. The state, however, became increasingly identified with the reactionary party in the South African Republic.\nIn 1895 the Volksraad passed a resolution, in which they declared their readiness to entertain a proposition from the South African Republic in favour of some form of federal union. In the same year Reitz retired from the presidency of the Orange Free State. The 1896 presidential election to succeed him was won by  M. T. Steyn, a judge of the High Court, who took office in February 1896. In 1896 President Steyn visited Pretoria, where he received an ovation as the probable future president of the two Republics. A further offensive and defensive alliance between the two Republics was then entered into, under which the Orange Free State took up arms on the outbreak of hostilities between the British and the South African Republic in October 1899.In 1897 President Kruger, bent on still further cementing the union with the Orange Free State, had visited Bloemfontein. It was on this occasion that Kruger, referring to the London Convention, spoke of Queen Victoria as a kwaaje Vrouw (angry woman), an expression which caused a good deal of offence in England at the time, but which, in the phraseology of the Boers, was not meant by President Kruger as insulting.\n\nIn December 1897 the Free State revised its constitution in reference to the franchise law, and the period of residence necessary to obtain naturalization was reduced from five to three years. The oath of allegiance to the state was alone required, and no renunciation of nationality was insisted upon. In 1898 the Free State also acquiesced in the new convention arranged with regard to the Customs Union between the Cape Colony, Natal, Basutoland and the Bechuanaland Protectorate. But events were moving rapidly in the Transvaal, and matters had proceeded too far for the Free State to turn back. In May 1899 President Steyn suggested the conference at Bloemfontein between President Kruger and Sir Alfred Milner, but this act was too late. The Free Staters were practically bound to the South African Republic, under the offensive and defensive alliance, in case hostilities arose with Great Britain.The Free State began to expel British subjects in 1899, and the first act of the Second Boer War was committed by Free State Boers, who, on 11 October 1899, seized a train upon the border belonging to Natal. For President Steyn and the Free State of 1899, neutrality was impossible. A resolution was passed by the volksraad on 27 September declaring that the state would observe its obligations to the Transvaal whatever might happen.After the surrender of Piet Cronj\u00e9 in the Battle of Paardeberg on 27 February 1900, Bloemfontein was occupied by the British troops under Lord Roberts from 13 March onward, and on 28 May a proclamation was issued annexing the Free State to the British dominions under the title of Orange River Colony. For nearly two years longer the burghers kept the field under Christiaan de Wet and other leaders, but by the articles of peace signed on 31 May 1902 British sovereignty was acknowledged.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Divisions ===\nThe country was divided into the following districts:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAn estimate in 1875: White: 75,000; Native and Colored: 25,000. The first census, carried out in 1880, found that 'Europeans' made up 45.7% of the population. Bloemfontein, the capital, had 2,567 inhabitants. The 1890 census, which was reportedly not very accurate, found a population of 207,503.In 1904 the colonial census was taken. The population was 387.315, of whom 225.101 (58.11%) were blacks, 142.679 (36.84%) were whites, 19.282 (4.98%) were coloreds and 253 (0.07%) were Indians. The largest cities were Bloemfontein (33.883) (whites - 15.501 or 45.74%),  Harrismith (8.300) (whites - 4.817 or 58.03%), Kroonstad (7.191) (whites - 3.708 or 51.56%).In 1911 population was 528.174, of whom 325.824 (61.68%) were blacks, 175.189 (33.16%) were whites, 26.554 (5.02%) were coloreds and 607 (0.11%) were Indians. The capital, Bloemfontein, had a population of 26.925.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPostage stamps and postal history of the Orange Free State\nList of former sovereign states\nNatalia Republic\nConsulates of the Orange Free State\nParis Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property\nWitzieshoek revolt\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

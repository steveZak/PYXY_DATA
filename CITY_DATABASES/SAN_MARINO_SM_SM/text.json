Did not go to the second Torre but this should be as nice as the first one.",

If you are lucky with the wheather you can also see the sea.",

          "We took a guided tour up to the entrance of Guaita Fortress. It is the oldest and most famous tower on Mount Titano. This fortress was built in the 11th century. It does cost to go inside the fortress, but it is well worth the small price. Again it is a lot of uphill and/or",
          "The first thing to see when looking at Monte Titano (Titan Hill) are the beautiful fortresses of San Marino. It's a great experience walking through the narrow streets, squares and getting to the first fort, Guaita.The other two are De La Fratta ( Cesta ) and Montale. The Guaita",
          "We had never heard of the little country of San Marino, but we stayed there during our trip to Italy. Such a neat place. We parked in lot #7 and walked to Hotel Bellavista - a nice room with a great view. Don't forget to visit the tourist office while you're there - you can pay",

          "We have lived in Italy for two years and finally made it to see San Marino. The views are amazing. Traveling here is a must see. The town is stroller friendly but a lot of hills. Also there\u2019s a lot of stairs inside and around the castles.",
          "This tower was the highlight of our visit to San Marino! Make sure you enter, because I saw people looking in and turning around. They really missed the most breathtaking view from that tower. Inside the tower the steps to go up are quite dangerous looking and unsettling",

The story and independence of San Marino are more impressive than the site there. I bought tickets to visit the 2 towers. The view from the towers especially from",
          "The place is nice and the view wonderful. The place is like a supermarket - lots of little shops for tourists with high prices. However, the tower is worth the visit. San Marino is really a nice place and we will return there.",

          "Had an amazing time at San Marino with family. The city, restaurants, hotels, markets and shops were wonderful to visit to, especially seeing the view from above where the castle stands. There were some places where I has no time to visit sadly but would for sure come again and",

The ticket to climb both towers and see the museums is \u20ac10.50 with \u20ac1.50 returned if you give them the access card back at the end.

          "Didn't go inside, as we were on a flying visit, as others have said, there is not a lot to do here. I was just happy to see this beautiful tower. To me it epitomises San Marino, as this mighty structure totally dominates the city in images and now I know it does in reality as",

          "This was definitely the best part of our day trip to San Marino. Nice views around, not too crowded, small enough for families so that the kids don't get bored, nice little presentations of the history, no annoying tourist hawkers. Definitely everyone should climb up and visit",

          "Entering the old town, with restricted vehicular traffic, after 6pm gives the real feel of the medieval town. Though the crowds come for the shopping, just walking along the ramparts and paths from tower to tower is a great experience especially if you can do it just before",

          "As you approach San Marino from the road below, you just know the view will be great - and the view doesn't disappoint. Cool and breezy which is often a relief from the hot plains below. Make sure you arrive long before 16:30 as it closes then.",
          "We went on a clear day to San Marino and going up the towers was incredible. You can see Rimini and the coast of the Adriatic when it's clear, and on the other side there are mountains and rolling hills. It's well worth the hike up to the top of San Marino. Highly recommend.",
          "After making it all the very up to the very tip top of San Marino, it would be ridiculous to skip the views from this fortress/tower. There is a clear perspective for nearly 360 degrees and the panoramic photo opportunities are incredible. The towers themselves are simple and",

          "This Tower is part of the old walls and defence of San Marino and the one ticket that includes this plus the Cesta (second) tower, Palazzo Pubblico, State Museum, Church & Museum of San Francesco is very good value. This tower has a little history in English & Italian on boards",
          "Well worth trekking up the steep hill. Hair raising views all around and a really interesting short visit. The stairs require a degree of mobility and high heels are a bad idea.",

          "This tower made you feel that you were in Medival times. It is a hard walk if you have any leg problems. I only made it to the second tower. There is a small arms museum that made you think about the people who had to wear all that armor. If you are in San Marino then you",
          "It was totally worth visiting the Towers of San Marino, but the Guaita Tower was the best one. The highlight is going up to the top taking a very tight stairs, it was creepy but It made me feel like I was living at the time it was built. :)",
          "It isn't really a \"castle\" and none of these are, but it is a great little tower with just unreal UNREAL views. The climb is rough, and there aren't facilities, but did I mention how amazing the view is? Truly spectacular. I must have well over 100 photos. DO NOT miss this",
          "it is the smallest of the 3 towers and nothing to see except the view the other 2 towers are worth the trip. It is not suited if you have problems walking or wheel chair",
          "I was impressed how well conserved is the place. Inexpensive for visit, allow fantastic vies from the area. My advice is to be prepared for a good walk uphill, and possibly avoid very hot days. Driving around the place, even being a bit dangerous is another good experience.",

          "I visited San Marino from Bologna (train from Bologna to Rimini, then bus from Rimini to San Marino). If you travel during summer time, it's best to reserve the train tickets in advance since many of the trains are sold out. Before you do that, it's good idea to check the time",
          "No doubt it is one of the well-preserved city walls to which I have ever witnessed, it is placed on top of Mount Titan ( Monte Titano) and to reach it from the city of San Marino you have to walk for a few hundred meters before arriving to the towers. Enviable and breathtaking",

          "This should be everyone's first thing to do when they arrive in San Marino. The views from the tower are simply mesmerising and off the full 360 panorama of San Marino and the Adriatic coast as well as the mountains and valleys. Buy the red ticket for \u20ac4.50 as it gives you",

          "A visit to San Marino is not complete without a look over the towers. The first one has a excellent tower you can climb up to and get an even better view of the area, it also has some of the prison cells which are worthwhile seeing, there is a very nondescript well in the centre",
          "Definitely worth the trip and experience. The views are absolutely stunning (360 degrees). The towers and castles are beautiful, the town is charming, The Museums are nice (although not exceptional) and the people are friendly and nice. What more can you ask for?",

        "wiki": "The Basilica di San Marino (Marino translates from Latin to \"man of the sea\") is a Catholic church located in the Republic of San Marino. While the country has a distinct domination of historic religious buildings of Christian faith, the basilica is the main church of the City of San Marino.  It is situated on Piazza Domus Plebis in the northeastern edge of the city, adjacent to the Church of St. Peter. It is dedicated to Saint Marinus, the founder and patron of the Republic.The present church was built in 1836 in place of an earlier one that dated to 7th century.  It is built in the Neoclassical style, with a porch of eight Corinthian columns. Relics of St. Marino are enshrined in the basilica.\n\n\n== History ==\nAn earlier church was erected on the spot in the 4th century which was dedicated to the same patron. The first document attesting the existence of the church dates to 530 in the La Vita di San Severino by Eugippius.  A later document, the Placito Feretrano, dates from 885. The first document that directly relates to the \"Pieve di San Marino\" is dated 31 July 1113, with donations from the faithful public.At the beginning of the 1800s, the church was in critical condition.  In 1807, it was razed and a project for the construction of the new church was handed to the Bolognese Achille Serra. On 24 July 1825, the council decided to build a new church in the place where the old church had stood. Construction began on 28 July 1826 and was completed in 1838. On 5 February 1838, the church was solemnly inaugurated in the presence of the Bishop of Montefeltro, Crispino Agostinucci and the Captain's-Regent. On 21 July 1926, it was elevated to the rank of Basilica by Pius XI. The construction cost was 40,150 scudi and 76 baiocchi.\nOn 29 August 1982, the basilica was visited by John Paul II who blessed the church and the relics related to the deacon of San Marino. The Basilica of San Marino is depicted on the ten cent editions of the Sammarinese euro coins.\nOver the course of centuries, the basilica has witnessed civil turmoil. Because of this, in 1992, the Vatican made several decrees.  These included that the basilica, as the mother-church of all churches within the Republic, is made exempt from the jurisdiction of the parish of the city of San Marino. The basilica is entrusted to the care of a priest who holds the title of Rector, and the Rector is appointed and removed in accordance with canon law.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe interior of the basilica consists of three naves, supported by sixteen Corinthian columns which form a large ambulatory around the semicircular apse. The front porch of 8 columns, six at the front and two either side, has a Latin inscription written above it which reads \"DIVO. MARINO. PATRONO. ET. LIBERTATIS. AVCTORI. SEN. P. Q.\". The altar is adorned by a statue of St. Marino by Adamo Tadolini, a student of Antonio Canova. Under the altar are relics of St. Marino which were found on 3 March 1586; some relics were donated to the island of Rab (Croatia), the birthplace of the saint, on 28 January 1595. A reliquary bust in silver and gold dated to 2 September 1602 lies to the right of altar. In the right aisle is a small altar dedicated to Mary Magdelene and a painting by Elisabetta Sirani, on the subject Noli me tangere.\n\n\n== Chiesa di San Pietro ==\n\nThe Chiesa di San Pietro is located at the Basilica of San Marino, to the side of the front steps. It was originally built in 600. It houses a valuable altar with inlaid marble, donated by the musician Antonio Tedeschi in 1689, which is surmounted by a statue dedicated to St. Peter by Enrico Saroldi. In the crypt of this church there are two niches cut into rock that are said to be the beds of San Marino and San Leo. Inside is a monument to Pope John XXIII, erected by the Government of the Republic.\n\n\n== Celebrations ==\nSeveral liturgical celebrations are stipulated for the basilica.  Amongst these are included: the election and the establishment of the Captains Regent; the anniversary celebration of the Republic's Militia (25 March); national and religious holidays of San Marino, the Founder and Patron of the Republic (3 September), and St. Agatha, patroness of the Republic (5 February); and the religious festival honoring the St. of the Body and Blood of Christ.The basilica can also function as a venue for popular events such as the XII Autumn Music Festival production in 2010 of Mozart's Requiem Mass.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "The largest and most important church in San Marino, this isn't St Peter's, but it's still a very impressive sight. Small and conservatively decorated, it's a very tranquil and impressive spot nestling in amongst San Marino's curving, winding roads.",
          "This is the main church in San Marino. It is situated at the Piazzale Domus Plebis, and dedicated to Saint Marinus. He was the founder of chapel and monastery of San Marino. Church was built at the place of the old church from VII century in 1836. Relics of St. Marinus are kept",
          "When in San Marino the Basilica is well worth the time to take a quiet moment inside. The present church was built in 1836 and is built in the Neoclassical style, with a porch of eight Corinthian columns. Relics of St. Marino are enshrined in the basilica. The throne of the",
          "The Basilica is up a fairly steep hill but accessible for all. Traditional pillars outside of it, with a market in the evenings outside it too. During medieval week when I visited I watched swordfights outside too which was a unique experience! Worth seeing.",
          "If you are visiting San Marino you can't miss this basilica. Definitely worth a visit - from the outside as well the inside.",
          "I was there summer time and it was really beautiful. Normally you won't miss this place. You have so many restaurants and souvenir shop around the basilica. Enjoy in San Marino. Cheers",
          "San Marino like Vatican City is unique in being a country within a country , totally surrounded by Italy. For whatever reason they did not join the new republic crested by garibaldi in the 1850's. The Basilia is dedicated to St, Marinus, whose followers founded a community",
          "The basilica del santo marino is built in the Neoclassical style. On the right of this Basilica, one also finds the Chiesa Di San Pietro whehre one can peek through the gate inside. Beautiful :)",
          "If you take the time to travel to San Marino, this is just one of the beautiful sights worth seeing.",
          "Small but elegant, with a beautiful ceiling. This small, unobtrusive church is nicer than many we have visited. Surprising find.",
          "Another lovely old church in a wonderful location - not much else to say when you've visited lots of churches and are succumbing to 'Basillica fatigue'.",
          "I would say the bright clean modern day interior design was not quite what I was expecting but it was still worth the visit to step inside.",
          "Yet another of my accidental finds by simply wandering. I went inside and glad I did. Exterior is simple in design, and simple - as in this case - is elegant. The interior is beautiful but not in an outlandish way. Again; elegant.",
          "There was an ancient parish church and it was demolished so this could be built. This building is considered a blunder in the republic's history as its construction resulted in one of the very first Christian monuments which dated back to the 5th century to be demolished.",
          "The basilica is the most memorable part of San Marino. Views from around the basilica are beautiful.",
          "BASILICA DI SAN MARINO I love it! White pure simplicity, the inside invite you in a perfect and peaceful meditation. Not over distracted decorations, like most of Italian churches. By the entry \"No photos\" but I couldn't understand why not, it was empty, except for the beautiful",
          "Amazing place a must visit :) have dinner on top of the world, all the little side streets with shops with lots of treasure. Duty free shopping too. Have a nice cold drink on the way back down to soak up the atmosphere.",
          "It is worth visiting the Basilica for it's cool green neo-classical interior, altars and paintings. A restful stop on your tourist trail.",
          "This is situated on the edge of the wall of San Marino. Restoration has been taking place and the floor is done. It's very beautiful, but just to be in this amazing country on top of the mountain is an experience. Do stay the night here and walk the streets. Highly romantic.",
          "Regular bus service makes getting there really easy. It's quite a long trip from Rimini but well worth doing.",
          "An old church that retains its looks since it has never been damaged. It still had the golden candle holders and all its statues and paintings. Probably the only church in the world where you don't need to pay for the candles.",
          "Not as old as you might think but beautiful without the ostentatious and over the top decorations of other Basilicas. First and foremost this is church which is the way it should be, not an art gallery...",
          "If in San Marino, make sure you visit this beautiful church/basilica. It is different than most churches in neighboring Italy, much simpler in the architecture.",
          "I didn't expect to see such a big church in a place where everything looks so tiny. Despite not being among the biggest I've seen, the large columns make it look bigger than it is. There's nothing special about its interior, unless perhaps you enter to pray. The facade is",
          "ouside is like all romans building..the interior is lovely...the ceiling it is paited in beatifull and vived coloures...its aplce to see",
          "You'll recognize the outside style, but the interior is quite unique. It is simple and white, done gorgeously. This basilica is not as old as others in Italy, but is worth a visit - I promise there is none like it. It is light, less heavy and serious than other churches, and",
          "The Basilica di San Marino is a very attractive building with an even lovelier interior. Inside the church is quite light and airy with beautifully painted ceilings and a fresh appearance. Whilst it does not have a heavy, sombre and antiquated atmosphere it is nonetheless"

The other two are De La Fratta and Guaita.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nMontale is the smallest of the three peaks of Monte Titano. The tower on the peak was constructed in the 14th century. Unlike the other two towers constructed on the mount, Montale is not open to the public. It is one of the three towers depicted on both the national flag and coat of arms of San Marino.  It is thought to have been constructed to give protection against the increasing power of the Malatesta family in that region.  It was also used as a prison, and accordingly, the only entrance to the tower is a door about seven metres from ground level, which was common for prison architecture of the time.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nGuaita (1st tower)\nCesta (2nd tower)\nThree Towers of San Marino\nCity of San Marino",

          "It\u2019s a bit of a hike to reach the third tower in San Marino, but absolutely worth the walk. The views from the cliffs here are absolutely incredible and you can see for miles in every direction if the weather is clear.",
          "The third and the smallest tower of the three towers located at the three peaks of Monte Titano was built in the 14th century. It was probably constructed as a defense against the increasingly powerful Malatesta family and later it was used as a prison. It is not open to the",

          "This is the third of San Marino's three distinctive towers. Unlike the other two, it is not open so you can't go inside or climb up. There appears to be restoration work going on so maybe that will change in future. It's a short walk away from the other two, through pine",
          "The tower itself is closed but the views around and on the nature walk is stunning! I think San Marino is more of a tourist trap/novelty but you can't say anything bad about the views! Worth it to wake up early and see the sunrise and then walk the trail again to see the sunset."

The building, where official State ceremonies take place, is the seat of the Republic's main institutional and administrative bodies: the Captains Regent, the Grand and General Council, the Council of XII, and the Congress of State.\\nThe main section of the building is topped by battlements over a series of corbels. The clock tower above also features such an arrangement with battlements and corbels. The overall design is similar to the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, but on a much smaller scale.Located on the site of an ancient building called the Domus Magna Comunis, the current building was designed by the Roman architect Francesco Azzurri and was built between 1884 and 1894. After a hundred years of existence, it was becoming unsafe in today's standards, so a complex restoration project was undergone. The intervention was completed by the internationally renowned architect Gae Aulenti on 30 September 1996.\\n\\n\\n== References ==",

          "8euro is a lot to pay for what it is. It's at the end of the walk if you start at the bus station and go round to the castle at the top then back down.",
          "Interesting overview of our ability to inflict pain and suffering on each other. Number of items to look at labelled in 3 languages including English. Wish it had been a little lighter as would have easier to see but worth a visit.",
          "So my wife wasn't super into the museum, but I had looked forward to it immensely, maybe because I just love history and the study of human behaviour. We saved this museum for last (mainly because it is near the entrance to the city); it did not disappoint at all. My wife was",
          "one of the places to go while roaming around San Marino. Nothing spectacular but nice for a change of all what's possible there.",
          "Saying you \"like\" this museum feels odd, but it is certainly very informative and gives you terrible insight into how horrible people can be to people.",
          "Of all the small museums in the city, this one is the best, with the huge collection of the medieval torture instruments and devices. It was an interesting visit, although a bit hard to comprehend what a man can invent and produce to procure a physical pain or death to the",
          "this is the perfect place for the wifes that there husbunds did not let them buy what they wanted. pick up some pointers.",
          "One thing makes this museum so memorable. The lengths that human beings go to inflict the maximum pain, suffering and damage to another human being. I wonder if we have evolved at all.",
          "Nice and creative idea, but poor organisation. No sound, no route directions, bad organisation scenes (for example, you can not find right place to see the whole scene)",
          "This museum has a lot of staff inside it and doesn't take a long time to visit like about 30min. This museum is definitely worth visiting! I promise!",
          "This museum is good, interesting to see how humans can be so cruel to their own species. But your talking to the person who hates horror film and anything like that. My friend who went with me really liked it so it just depends on what you like. It's on the top so why not take",
          "Wandering around san marino came across this and thought we'd have a look, glad we did, fascinating different techniques displayed from around the world",
          "After a bit of prior research I made this a stop off point during our day visit to the city. Costing 8euro each, the excellent staff gave some very helpful instructions on the museum. 10 minutes later after reading 90% of the information we left. The museum has not a lot of",
          "all this things you can read online but to see it in real life, it is different story. multilingual explanations on every torture method, vivid pictures. makes you wonder how was it for real in that time when this was normal occurence. dont miss!!!!",
          "This is in a very nice and relaxed place in San Marino .Its high up on a mountain but the bus leaves you more on less there.The museum is small and good .Its very creepy in a good way",
          "Not so good as the museum in San Gimignano but it shows a lot of evil that man has invented. Most pieces are from the time of the Inquisition, when heretics were tortured by black coated Dominican monks.",
          "I did not realize that there were so many types of torture or that people are willing to do those types of things to other people. Worth a visit just to enlighten and educate yourself, but can be a little depressing as well.",
          "We visited San Marino on an afternoon. We saw the main monuments ( Castle, Statues, View) and then visted the Torture museum. It took about an hour to go trough the whole 2 1/2 floors and tis is reading each description. the museum has many devices I have never seen and each",
          "Amazing, stomach churning and a real eye opener. Steps within make it unsuitable for disabled visitors beyond the first floor.",
          "This is a monstrous topic, but as a significant part of history it is worth attention. There's a lot of information about various means of torture in this museum. It's curious",
          "The city has some great museums, The Torture Museum being one of them. The museum offers great information about the means of torture used back in history.",

          "It was an enjoyable (if toe-curling) experience to go round this little museum... The things humans did (and presumably still do) to each other! The English notations on each 'exhibit' were great, and the music helped add to the atmosphere. Lower the price a little, and you've",
          "Expensive entrance fee for this horrible attraction making fun with instruments of torture. A real tourist trap best being avoided.",

          "Small, dull, worst of all, expensive! Price is not mentioned anywhere at/around this place. You pay 8.5euro for an even duller ticket and the website on this ticket is even fake! I'm not saying 8.5euro is big money for me. It's just the comparison with the price for La Rocca,",

          "This museum was all things garish and grisly. A look at many exhibits (some I think we're genuine) of how human beings have done hideous things to each other over the ages by extreme measures of torture. I think the whole thing over two smallish floors took us around 15 minutes",
          "It is a very interesting museum with real things but could be bigger,although in a very short way you can learn about the horror of inquisition and could be even better with a guide helping you.You also get 50% discount, with San Marino card",
          "The museum was not huge but it was quite interesting. Definitely worth a visit. If you get the San Marino Card the entrance fee is reduced.",
          "Our trip to the museum lasted about 15 to 20 minutes, it was rather small, but the objects on display were interesting and well explained in at least four languages. If you don't have a lot of time to spend, but want to visit something the Torture Museum is worth a visit",
          "Informative, but gruesome to read and see the museum pieces. Items are well displayed and descriptions are in English, Italian, and German",
          "Whilst in Italy, came across various Torture museums and had a couple of minutes to spare at S. Marino and thought of giving it a try. Worth visiting as had various displays with simple explanations. Small yet dense museum. Recommend.",
          "San Marino itself was amazing so I wouldn't waste my time there inside at the torture museum. There were some interesting and depressing torture devices, the explanations were informative, and the lady selling the tickets was very friendly. But unless you really care about",
          "Well worth a visit. Fascinating to see but pleased I did not live in those times (or did I?). The exhibits are well set out with good explanations.",
          "The museum advertises it's instruments of torture, but that is only a small portion of the museum. The rest are wax figures of famous Italian and other heros. Could be better, but a nice change from archeology museums, etc."

        "wiki": "Tourism in San Marino, known also as the Most Serene Republic of San Marino (Italian: Serenissima Repubblica di San Marino) is an integral element of the economy within the microstate. The tourism sector contributes a large part of San Marino's GDP, with approximately 2 million tourists visiting per year.Tourism is among the republic\u2019s most important sectors due to its significant contribution to the GDP. The rate of tourists has increased exponentially in recent years, as visitors are drawn to the landscape, cuisine and architectural sights of the mountainous microstate. San Marino attracts approximately two million tourists a year, of which 1,822,000 derived from Europe in 2018. In comparison with the five other European microstates (Andorra, Liechtenstein, Malta, Monaco and Vatican City), as of 2018 San Marino attracts the fewest tourists.  \n\nGeographically, San Marino is an independent microstate surrounded by the Italian Republic. The enclave state is situated in central Italy on the northeastern edge of the Apennine Mountains, and is completely landlocked. However it is in close proximity to the Adriatic coastline, accessed through the Emilia-Romagna region. In the summer season, many tourists flock to San Marino for its vicinity to the beaches of the Adriatic coastline. Additionally people visit the republic to encounter the culture and cuisine, as well as to visit the many historical monuments, churches, and castles. \nMost tourists who visit San Marino are Italian, usually consisting of people who come to spend holidays in the Romagna riviera and decide to spend a half-day or at most a night in the country. Even though there are only a small number of non-Italian foreigners who visit the country, they still are vital to the Sammarinese economy. There are no border formalities with Italy. However, at the tourist office visitors can purchase souvenir stamps which are officially canceled inside their passports.\nThe City of San Marino itself contains most attractions.  The City is perched on a hill with regular parking areas for cars and buses.  The City historic centre itself is only a pedestrian zone that has mostly gift shops and food venues on both sides.\n\n\n== Land and Climate ==\nSan Marino is located on the Italian peninsula and consequently experiences the same weather patterns as the Italian state. San Marino has a Mediterranean climate of hot, dry summers and wet winters. However, as it is located in the vicinity of the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines the climate is often more harsh, with very hot, especially humid summers and very cold winters.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe commercial tourism sector in the Republic of San Marino originates primarily from the early nineteenth century onwards . Prior to the infrastructure improvements of the nineteenth century, the region never aroused great interest for a number of reasons. These included the fact that the state was quite impoverished and lacked the infrastructure to develop accessible connections with Italy.  During the late nineteenth century, the microstate embarked on a process of modernisation through the restructuring of the City of San Marino\u2019s historic centre.  This was marked by the construction of a new seat of government (Italian: Palazzo Pubblico) that was inaugurated in 1894.  Although the construction caused a fiscal strain on the Republic, the Palazzo Pubblico remains a major tourist attraction within the microstate. \nThe rates of tourists gradually increased in the successive years, facilitated by improvements to transportation and infrastructure in San Marino during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . The tourism industry in the region developed in great part following World War II, as the Italian economic \u201cboom\u201d brought developments to infrastructure that allowed for increased commercial tourism . \n\n\n== Visitor Attractions ==\nThe main tourist attractions in the most popular destination in the country, the City of San Marino, and the rest of the nation are:\n\n\n==== Palazzo Pubblico/Piazza della Libert\u00e0 ====\nThe Palazzo Pubblico (alternatively, the town hall) is located in Piazza della Libert\u00e0 in San Marino\u2019s historic city centre . The present building stands where the old town hall, named Domus Magna Comunis, built at the close of the fourteenth century, once stood. Following centuries of continued restorations, the original building was demolished in 1884 and inaugurated one decade later. The Roman architect Francesco Azzurri, who designed the Palazzo Pubblico, developed a design that resembled the simple, severe style of thirteenth and fourteenth century municipal halls. The modern Palazzo Pubblico encompasses the parliament of San Marino, including the Great and General Council, as well as the government and parliamentary committees. The Palazzo Pubblico is situated in the Piazza della Libert\u00e0, named for the Statue of Liberty found at the centre of the piazza. The neoclassical architecture attracts many tourists, especially the white carrara marble \u201cStatua della Libert\u00e0\u201d.\n\n\n==== Basilica di San Marino ====\nThe Basilica di San Marino is a Catholic church located on Piazza Domus Plebis on the northeastern side of the city of San Marino. The basilica is dedicated to Saint Marinus, the patron and founder of the microstate. The current basilica was reconstructed in the neoclassical style in 1836, replacing an earlier basilica from the 7th century. The relics of Saint Marinus are enshrined in the current basilica. \n\n\n==== Museo di Stato ====\nThe state museum of San Marino holds artistic, archeological and numismatic artefacts. From 2001, the state museum has been housed within San Marino\u2019s historic Palazzo Pergami-Belluzzi. It is divided into four floors and holds a combination of permanent and temporary exhibitions.\n\n\n==== Monte Titano and The Three Towers of San Marino (Guaita, Cesta , and Montale) ====\nThe historic centre of San Marino is situated on Mount Titano. Many of the original Medieval elements of the historic centre on Mount Titano have been preserved and the site is on the UNESCO World Heritage list . The historical centre of San Marino dates back to the thirteenth century and includes many Medieval architectural features such as fortification towers, bastions, gates and walls. The city centre also comprises the Titano Theatre (dating back to the eighteenth century), the neoclassical San Marino Basilica, and convents dating from the fourteenth and sixteenth century respectively. Monte Titano covers fifty five hectares and features three Medieval towers built on its three peaks; Guaita, De La Fratta (alternatively, Cesta) and Montale.\n\n\n== Visitors ==\nIn recent years, tourism to the region of San Marino has increased exponentially. San Marino recently experienced a 5.6% rise in tourists visiting the republic, with an increase from 1,888,000 tourists in 2015 to 2,000,000 in 2016 . The primary visitors to the microstate come from the nation surrounding it; Italy. In 2018, tourism from Italy held the majority of the tourism market at 66.84%, a decrease of 3.16% from 2017. \nIn 2015, 37% of tourists to the region visited for leisure and holiday-making, while 38% visited for personal purposes. The remaining 25% of visitors travelled for the purpose of business. Although data from 2014 to 2018 conveys that all visitors to the republic arrived on land (via roads/driving), this is because San Marino is inaccessible to any other mode of transport. Between 2017 and 2018, the average overnight stay in a commercial hotel or equivalent increased from 1.69 to 1.81 nights.  \n\n\n== Economic Impact ==\nThe economic impact of tourism on San Marino is visible through the significant increase in infrastructure amenable to commercial tourism. From 2015 to 2018, the number of hotels and equivalent accommodation increased from 35 to 43 establishments. In 2014, the available capacity of beds per 1,000 inhabitants peaked at 47.1.  \nEmployment in the commercial tourism industry has remained steady at 3,500 employed individuals from 2014 to 2018.  Within the industry, a recorded 700 are employed in accommodation services for hotels, while travel agencies and reservation services employ approximately 100 people. The majority work in miscellaneous tourism sectors, with the figure standing at 2,500. \n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nThe Sammarinese cuisine boasts strong similarities to Italian cuisine, particularly that of the regions it borders; Le Marche and Emilia-Romagna. There are a number of traditional dishes that attract visitors to the microstate. The Christmas cake of honey, nuts and dried fruit, known as bustrengo in San Marino, draws visitors to the region for festive celebrations. The dessert the region is most renowned for is named the \u2018torta tre monti\u2019 (or \u2018cake of the three towers\u2019). This traditional Sammarinese cake is made from thin layers of wafer held together by a hazelnut paste and covered in dark chocolate fondant. The name of the cake derives from the three towers of Monte Titano (Guaita, Cesta and Montale) which are depicted on the flag of the microstate. \nIn terms of savoury dishes, the Sammarinesi are known for their traditional northeastern Appenine fare of roast rabbit with fennel, piadina (a chickpea flour flatbread) \n\n and \u2018nidi di rondine\u2019 (a handmade pasta with a name meaning \u2018swallow\u2019s nests\u2019). The region upholds a tradition of manufacturing cheese, a major facet of northern Italian cuisine adopted from its neighbours. Much like the bordering region of Emilia-Romagna, pasta and meat dishes play a significant role in Sammarinese cuisine. Typical savoury dishes of this category include tagliatelle, lasagna, ravioli, pasta e ceci (chickpea soup), passatelli in brodo (dumplings in broth) and cotoletta alla bolognese (cutlets bolognese style). Locally produced wine also is a major part of Sammarinese cuisine.

Common second languages of citizens include English, French, and Sammarinese (the local dialect, a distant relative of the Romagnol dialect).\n\n\n== Shopping ==\nTourists are drawn to San Marino for its promise of tax-free shopping. The microstate features many stores offering luxury products, such as jewellery, perfume, and clothing. Handmade leather goods (including bags, shoes, and wallets) are also popular purchases due to the many artisan leather goods available for purchase without the 20% VAT imposed in the principality. Other items popular with visiting tourists include local wine and cigarettes.  \n\n\n=== Currency ===\nShopping in the state of San Marino is facilitated by the fact that the nation maintains a currency union with Italy, meaning that they use the euro like the vast majority of their European neighbours. \n\n\n== Promoting Tourism In San Marino ==\nThe government of San Marino intends to promote further tourism to the microstate through the Republic of San Marino\u2019s Economic Development Agency Chamber of Commerce. The primary objectives of the agency are to support the Tourist Office and the Ministry of Tourism in order to attract tourists and manage incoming tourist flows, and also to further pursue diplomatic networks and consular connections, in order to develop a profile for the state of San Marino as a unique destination renowned for hospitality, history and landscape. \nThe Ministry of Tourism in San Marino is reforming its tourism strategy in order to increase the microstate\u2019s rate of foreign visitors. This reformed strategy is being implemented through the development of the Internationalization Division within San Marino\u2019s Chamber of Commerce. This division seeks to attract arrivals to the region based on three categories; visit San Marino, study in San Marino, and invest in San Marino. The diversification of San Marino\u2019s Ministry of Tourism comes as a result of their newly implemented marketing of a \u201cculture of \"barrier-free\" hospitality\u2026 offering tailor-made services according to needs.\u201dThe San Marino Ministry of Tourism has further expanded its capacity for tourists through the development of the \u2018Republic of San Marino Conventions & Visitors Bureau\u2019. The establishment of the bureau as a directory for services available in the region has occurred to further promote tourism to San Marino by encouraging the conduct of business in the microstate. \nThe current slogan for tourism in San Marino is as follows; \u201cImagining It Is Not Enough. Come and experience it.\u201d The new campaign is being implemented to further revenue from tourism, as currently San Marino is the least visited microstate in Europe. \n\n\n== Events in San Marino ==\n\nSan Marino attracts tourists at all times of the year. The principality holds many ceremonies intended to display the millenary history of San Marino as well as its religious heritage.\nFor example, each year on the 3rd of September, San Marino celebrates the Feast of Saint Marinus (the founder of the Republic) with mass at the Basilica of Saint Marinus. This is followed by a procession throughout the city in which the relics of Saint Marinus are carried. The procession is succeeded by the famous \u201cPalio delle Balestre Gradi\u201d (\u201ccrossbow competition\u201d) and a concert by the San Marino military band with a firework display. \nOnce a year, the world's smallest Republic revives its history when it turns into a theatrical spectacle of the Medieval Days festival. Every July, San Marino entices people within its ancient walls to experience the microstate's centuries-old stories in its medieval village.Another annual celebration in San Marino is the Catholic religious festivity of the Corpus Domini, held on June 11 each year. This festivity begins with mass at the Basilica of Saint Marinus, followed by a procession around Piazza della Liberta accompanied by the military band. \nAdditionally, the San Marino and Rimini Coast Motorcycle Grand Prix is an annual event that occurs each September, the first having taken place in 1980. \n\n\n== See also ==\nEconomy of San Marino\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nState Board of Tourism website",

As I\u2019m reading the reviews, I am noticing many people paid a cheaper price than we were charged and we were even charged the \u201cdiscounted\u201d museum rate. It was terrible, and took us less than 5",

        "wiki": "The San Gabriel Valley (Spanish: Valle de San Gabriel) is one of the principal valleys of Southern California, lying generally to the east of the city of Los Angeles. Surrounding features include:\n\nSan Gabriel Mountains on the north,\nSan Rafael Hills to the west, with Los Angeles Basin beyond; San Fernando Valley and Crescenta Valley farther to the northwest,\nPuente Hills to the south, with the coastal plain of Orange County beyond,\nChino Hills and San Jose Hills to the east, with the Pomona Valley and Inland Empire beyond.The San Gabriel valley derives its name from the San Gabriel River that flows southward through the center of the valley, which itself was named for the Spanish Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel originally built in the Whittier Narrows in 1771.\nAt one time predominantly agricultural, the San Gabriel Valley is today almost entirely urbanized and is an integral part of the Greater Los Angeles metropolitan area. It is one of the most ethnically diverse regions in the country. About 200 square miles (520 km2) in size, the valley includes thirty-one cities and five unincorporated communities.In 1886, Pasadena was the first independent incorporated city still located in Los Angeles County (both Anaheim and Santa Ana are now located in Orange County).\n\n\n== Cities and communities ==\n\nThe San Gabriel Valley is in Los Angeles County. The incorporated cities and unincorporated neighborhoods of the San Gabriel Valley include:\n\nWhittier, like Montebello, is considered a part of the Gateway Cities region. An unincorporated portion of Whittier, Rose Hills, sits below the Puente Hills. Although most of the city sits around the San Gabriel Mountains Whittier is not a San Gabriel Valley city. This is different from Montebello, which is a member of the Gateway Cities Council of Governments, despite geographically being part of the San Gabriel Valley.Claremont, Diamond Bar, La Verne, Pomona, San Dimas and Walnut are adjacent to the San Gabriel Valley, and although are properly considered part of the Pomona Valley, they are also commonly considered part of the San Gabriel Valley. The 57 Freeway (Orange Freeway) is generally considered the dividing line between the Pomona and San Gabriel valleys. However, for statistical and economic development purposes, the County of Los Angeles generally includes these six cities as part of the San Gabriel Valley.  The community of El Sereno, in the city of Los Angeles, is situated at the westernmost edge of the Valley. Unofficial estimates place the combined population of the San Gabriel Valley at around 2 million\u2014roughly a fifth of the population of Los Angeles County.\n\n\n== Early history ==\nBefore the arrival of the Spaniards, the land along the Rio Hondo River, a branch of the San Gabriel River, was populated by the Tongva part of the Uto-Aztecan family Native Americans. The Tongva occupied much of the Los Angeles basin and the islands of Santa Catalina, San Nicolas, San Clemente and Santa Barbara. In the northern part of the valley were the Hahanog-na Indian tribe, a branch of the Tongva Nation (part of the Shoshone language group) who lived in villages scattered along the Arroyo Seco and the canyons from the mountains down to the South Pasadena area. In 1542, when the explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo arrived off the shores of San Pedro and Santa Catalina. The Tongva were the people who rowed the remarkable Ti'ats (plank canoes) out to meet Cabrilho. The language of the Tongva was different from the neighboring Indian tribes and it was called Gabrielino by the Spanish. The Tongva also provide the origin of many current names; Piwongna \u2013 Pomona,  Pasakeg-na \u2013 Pasadena, Cucomog-na \u2013 Cucamonga. The Gabrielinos lived in dome-like structures with thatched exteriors. Both sexes wore long hair styles and tattooed their bodies.  During warm weather the men wore little clothing, but the women would wear minimal skirts made of animal hides. During the cold weather they would wear animal skin capes. European diseases killed many of the Tongva and by 1870 the area had few remaining native inhabitants. Today, several bands of Tongva people live in the Los Angeles area.The first Europeans to see inland areas of California were the members of the 1769 Portol\u00e0 expedition, which traveled north by land after establishing the first Spanish settlement in today's state of California at San Diego. On July 30, the expedition crossed the San Gabriel River and continued north toward what is now the city of Los Angeles. To cross the river, the expedition built a rough bridge, which gave the name La Puente to today's San Gabriel Valley city, and hills to the south are called the Puente Hills. A few years later, a mission was established near the river crossing.\n\nMission San Gabriel Arcangel was founded by Franciscan Father Junipero Serra, first head of the Spanish missions in California, on September 8, 1771. Its original location, called Mission Vieja, was near where San Gabriel Boulevard now crosses the Rio Hondo, which is also near the present day Juan Matias Sanchez Adobe. Angel Somera and Pedro Cambon were the first missionary priests at the new mission, which marked the beginning of the Los Angeles region's settlement by Spaniards. The San Gabriel mission was the third of twenty-one missions that would ultimately be established along California's El Camino Real.\nThe San Gabriel mission did well in establishing cattle ranching and farming, but six years after its founding a destructive flood led the mission fathers to relocate the establishment to its current location farther north in present-day city of San Gabriel. The original mission site is now marked by a California Historical Landmark.During the early years of the mission, the region operated under a Rancho system. The lands which now compose the city of Montebello were originally parts of Rancho San Antonio, Rancho La Merced, and Rancho Paso de Bartolo. The Juan Matias Sanchez Adobe, built in 1844, remains standing at the center of old Rancho La Merced in Eastern Montebello in the La Merced area. Recently restored, it is the city's oldest structure.\nMission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel  served a central role in Spanish colonial society, with many of the area's first Mexican settlers being baptized at the mission, including Pio Pico, who was born and baptized at the mission in 1801. He became governor of California twice, in 1832 and in 1845 and the city of Pico Rivera was named honoring him as the last Mexican governor of California.\nThe Battle of Rio San Gabriel took place in Montebello on January 8, 1847 on the banks of the Rio Hondo. This battle gave the control of Los Angeles and Alta California to the United States, and was a decisive battle in the Mexican-American war. Two days later, after several battle losses and defeats, Mexico was forced to cede Alta California to the United States. By 1852, after American occupation, San Gabriel became one of the first townships in the County of Los Angeles. Today the battle site is California State Historical Landmark #385, and there are two old cannons and a plaque commemorating the battle overlooking the river on Bluff Rd. and Washington Blvd.In 1853, with a contingent of Army Engineers passing through searching for the best route to build a railroad, Geologist William P. Blake observed that the once-extensive vineyards were falling to decay, with fences broken down and animals roaming freely through it. But the bells were ringing, and the church was in use. Prophetically, he wrote, \"I believe that when the adaptation of that portion of California to the culture of the grape and the manufacture of wine becomes known and appreciated, the state will become celebrated not only for its gold and grain, but for it fruits and wines.Following the American Civil War, some 5,000 acres (20 km2) of the East Los Angeles region were owned by an Italian settler from Genoa, Alessandro Repetto. After Repetto's death in 1885, his brother sold his rancho to a consortium of five Los Angeles businessmen including banker Isaias Hellman and wholesale grocer/historian Harris Newmark for $60,000, about $12 an acre.Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, and South Asian pioneers and settlers first came to the San Gabriel Valley in the mid-19th century. These pioneers worked the fields, picked the grapes and citrus fruit, and built part the infrastructure of today's San Gabriel Valley. In the 1920s Japanese immigrants arrived in Monterey Park to work as farmhands.\nThe discovery of oil by Standard Oil Company in the Montebello hills, in 1917, brought about a revolutionary change to the locality. The agricultural hills soon became a major contributor to oil production. By 1920, its oil fields were producing one-eighth of California's crude oil. For several decades, the hills were dotted with active oil wells.The cities of Whittier, Covina and Pasadena were formerly the sites of the citrus industry. In addition, the oil, dairy and cattle industries used to flourish in the southern region of the SGV. Many equestrian trails in the San Gabriel Valley\u2014specifically, in Covina and Walnut\u2014have disappeared or fallen into disuse. The remaining rural countryside-like areas include the area between eastern West Covina and Cal Poly Pomona and in Walnut and Diamond Bar and La Puente.\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n1769: First Europeans pass through in the Spanish Portola Expedition.\n1771: Mission San Gabriel established. The entire valley eventually becomes mission-controlled ranch and agricultural land. Native tribes are absorbed into the mission system.\n1774: First Europeans reach the valley from the east, an expedition led by Juan Bautista de Anza.\n1834: With the secularization of the missions, former mission lands are divided into large land grants called ranchos.\n1886: Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad opens.\n1890: The first Tournament of Roses Parade is presented in Pasadena.\n1914: Erection of the first two tents which were the first building blocks of today's City of Hope National Medical Center\n1920: The California Institute of Technology or Caltech opens in Pasadena (previously Throop College of Technology, est. 1891).\n1941: The first freeway in the United States, Arroyo Seco Parkway (now part of California 110, north of downtown Los Angeles), opens.\n1942\u20131944 Japanese American citizens were sent to a Japanese internment camp at Santa Anita Park during World War II, with up to 17,000 people living in horse stables.\n1940s1950s: San Gabriel Valley changes from acres of farmland to suburban bedroom community.\n1957: San Bernardino Freeway (Interstate 10) opens.\n1970s\u20131980s: Taiwanese immigrants began settling in Monterey Park and its neighborhoods.\n1980s\u2013present Chinese and Hong Kong immigrants began to settle in Alhambra, Arcadia, El Monte, Monterey Park, Rosemead, San Gabriel, and San Marino.\n\n\n== Demographics and ethnic diversity ==\nThe total population of the San Gabriel Valley in the 2000 Census was 1,510,378 people, of which 1,425,596 were living in the 30 incorporated cities. The average size of a household in the San Gabriel Valley according to the 2000 Census was 3.28 persons compared with 2.98 persons for Los Angeles County as a whole. Eight cities in the Valley have average household sizes of over 4 persons, while an unincorporated area, the South San Jose Hills, was at a significant 5.07 persons per household. (Most addresses do not use South San Jose Hills as the city but use La Puente, West Covina, or Valinda.) At the other end of this scale is Sierra Madre, at 2.20 persons per household.The age distribution in the San Gabriel Valley was a little unusual when compared with the County. A larger share of the population was aged 10\u201319, 15.5% versus 14.8% for the County. Also, the Valley had a higher share of people over 45 years of age. The income ranges in the San Gabriel Valley area are also quite wide. The highest median household income was found in San Marino ($117,267), followed by Bradbury ($100,454). At the other end of the scale was El Monte with a median household income of $32,439. Four other cities in the Valley had household incomes of less than $40,000.Significant percentages of all major ethnic groups reside in San Gabriel Valley communities, and the area is in general one of the most ethnically diverse regions in the country. The majority of people residing in the San Gabriel Valley are Hispanics and Asian Americans. The communities of Glendora, La Verne, Claremont, Monrovia, San Marino, Sierra Madre, Pasadena, South Pasadena, and San Dimas have significant Caucasian populations.\nThe African American population in the San Gabriel Valley is relatively low. However, there are sizable, long-established  African American communities in the western Altadena area and in northwest Pasadena, as well as in Monrovia.Montebello is home to the oldest Armenian community in Los Angeles County and home to Holy Cross Armenian Apostolic Cathedral, which was the only Armenian cathedral in California until Saint Leon Cathedral was built in Burbank in 2012.  The Armenian Martyrs Monument at Bicknell Park commemorating the victims of the Armenian Genocide by the Ottoman Turks is the largest monument of the genocide found on public property in the world. The Armenian community of Pasadena has its roots in the 1890s. The Pashgian Bros. Oriental Rugs and Fine Carpets was established in 1889.\nHispanics, predominately Mexican Americans, are concentrated in Azusa, Alhambra, Baldwin Park, City of Industry, El Monte, Hacienda Heights, La Puente, Montebello, Rosemead, San Gabriel, South El Monte, West Covina, Covina, Pomona, and Whittier, with significant populations in Pasadena and South Pasadena.The San Gabriel Valley has the largest concentration of Asian American communities in the United States. Eight of the ten cities in the United States with the largest proportion of Chinese Americans are located in the San Gabriel Valley. The cities of Monterey Park, Walnut, Alhambra, San Gabriel, San Marino, Rowland Heights, Hacienda Heights, Diamond Bar, and Arcadia contain Asian American majorities. \"New\" Chinatowns have been established in many cities in the San Gabriel Valley.\nThe Gabrieleno/Tongva of San Gabriel are headquartered in San Gabriel. A small Native American population is also located in Arcadia, Rowland Heights, Walnut, and Diamond Bar. Despite the European influx they remained an integral part of the Southern California community, and continue to in the present day.There are many Filipino Americans, residing in West Covina and Walnut. Vietnamese Americans tend to be concentrated in San Gabriel, Rosemead, and El Monte. Many Korean Americans live in Hacienda Heights, Rowland Heights, and Diamond Bar. A longstanding Japanese American community exists in Monterey Park.\n\n\n=== Asian American influx ===\n\nEarly Chinese pioneers settled into the Valley mostly as laborers. They packed oranges, picked walnuts, did construction, owned or worked in laundries, and worked as cooks and servants in the homes of the wealthy. Mostly a bachelor society, the early Chinese did not leave many descendants. By the late 1880s, there was a growing Japanese pioneer population. Filipinos and Asian Indians also served as laborers in the valley.\nAlmost a century later, in the wake of the San Gabriel Valley's burgeoning population of Asian Americans, they have become a dominant cultural force. Several business districts developed to serve their needs creating a collection of Southern California Chinatowns loosely connected along the Valley Boulevard Corridor. This trend began in the city of Monterey Park during the late 1970s when many well-to-do Taiwanese professionals began settling in the area.  Initially, many Chinese restaurateurs and business owners used primarily Traditional Chinese script and not English names on their business signs. This changed in 1986, when the city council of Monterey Park enacted an ordinance requiring the all businesses to translate their business signs and describe the nature of their businesses in English, deemed a matter of public safety.\nMonterey Park is a microcosm of changing demographics, highlighting Asian American history and evolution in the San Gabriel Valley. Rosemead has a smaller group of Vietnamese and Chinese business districts. There are also small pockets of Chinese American businesses that are scattered throughout San Gabriel Valley cities. In Rowland Heights, a handful of Korean American strip malls co-exist with Chinese American businesses. Another ethnic enclave is the Filipino American business district of Little Manila, in West Covina along with an Asian indoor and outdoor shopping center. Small Chinatowns have sprung up in many cities throughout the valley.\nBy the 2010 census there were more than half a million Asian Americans living in San Gabriel Valley. While smaller than the Latino population in the valley, it outnumbered the White population, and had a faster growth rate.  More than a quarter of the population in the region are Asian American. The largest populations of Asian Americans in San Gabriel Valley were Chinese, Filipinos, Vietnamese, Korean, Taiwanese, and Japanese.\n\n\n== Local interest ==\nThe San Gabriel Valley is home to the annual Tournament of Roses Parade, which is broadcast live on television on New Year's Day from Pasadena. After the parade, the Rose Bowl game between two rival college football teams is also televised live.\n\nAs the oldest incorporated community in the valley, the City of Pasadena serves as  a cultural center for the San Gabriel Valley. Several art-house film and play theatres are located in Pasadena, including the Pasadena Playhouse. In addition, the local news/talk National Public Radio station KPCC 89.3 FM broadcasts from Pasadena City College, although it is operated by Minnesota Public Radio.Old Pasadena, which has been restored and rejuvenated, remains highly popular. Old Pasadena has an active nightlife, a shopping mall, boutiques, outdoor caf\u00e9s, nightclubs, comedy clubs, and varied restaurants. Other communities hope to emulate its successes through commercial redevelopment and reviving their own downtown areas or \"Main Streets\".\nThe city of Azusa has attempted to encourage redevelopment of its once-dilapidated downtown section by using a Route 66 theme. Covina has had moderate success with its nostalgic Downtown Covina, with emphasis placed on a small-town America atmosphere and mom-and-pop merchants rather than big-box retail chains; Monrovia has also embraced this theme for their \"Old Town.\" Alhambra has also worked to renovate its downtown along Main St. San Gabriel Mission is the center of Historical Culture in SGV.\nThe California Institute of Technology is located in Pasadena. The university is ranked in the top 10 universities worldwide by metrics such as citation index, Nobel Prizes, and general university rankings. Caltech is also responsible for the well-known Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which designs and engineers many of NASA's spacecraft.The city of Baldwin Park is the birthplace of the popular hamburger fast food chain In-N-Out Burger. Its first location opened in the city in 1948.Huy Fong's Sriracha sauce, the ubiquitous Sriracha sauce found at Vietnamese restaurants across the western world, manufactures and is headquartered in Irwindale.Naked Juice, now a division of PepsiCo, is headquartered in Monrovia.\nPanda Express was launched as a fast food version of the Panda Inn restaurant in Pasadena in 1983. The company's headquarters are in Rosemead.\nTrader Joe's opened its first location in Pasadena in 1967. The company's headquarters are now in Monrovia.\n\n\n=== Politics and government ===\nMost cities have their own local mayor, city council, police and fire departments. Unincorporated areas such as Hacienda Heights and Rowland Heights are governed by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has jurisdiction in these areas.\nIn many unincorporated areas, advisory town councils guide the decisions, made by a supervisor or city manager. Often these groups began as collaborations of local homeowner associations. The Hacienda Heights Improvement Association, Rowland Heights Coordinating Council, and Altadena Town Council are examples of advisory bodies that are officially sanctioned by the county supervisor representing that community.\nIn 2003, voters in the unincorporated community of Hacienda Heights defeated a proposal to incorporate as a city. It remains an unincorporated district governed by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors rather than by a locally elected mayor and city council.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nFoothill Transit and the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority provide bus transit services throughout the valley. El Monte Station, a large regional bus station, provides transportation to Union Station in downtown Los Angeles via the El Monte Busway, an 11-mile (18 km) shared-use bus corridor (transitway). The Metrolink San Bernardino Line commuter train runs westward to Downtown Los Angeles and eastward to San Bernardino through the valley.\nOn March 5, 2016 the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority opened the Metro Gold Line foothill extension, expanding the current light rail service that previously traveled from East LA to Pasadena through Downtown LA to a new Northern terminus in Azusa.Several cities provide their own in-city transportation shuttles. Cities known to provide such service are:\n\nAlhambra\nArcadia\nBaldwin Park\nDuarte\nGlendora\nLa Puente\nMonrovia\nMontebello\nMonterey Park\nPasadena\nTemple City\nWest CovinaThe San Gabriel Valley is served by several major freeways:\n\nthe Foothill Freeway (Interstate 210 (California) and State Route 210)\nthe Ventura Freeway (State Route 134)\nthe San Bernardino Freeway (Interstate 10)\nthe Pomona Freeway (State Route 60)\nthe Pasadena Freeway (State Route 110)\nthe Long Beach Freeway (Interstate 710)\nthe San Gabriel River Freeway (Interstate 605)\nthe Orange Freeway (State Route 57)I-710 ends abruptly at the western border of Alhambra, near California State University, Los Angeles, with an unsigned spur of I-710 starting again in Pasadena at California Boulevard and ending at the junction of I-210 and SR 134. Efforts to complete the freeway were met with fierce opposition, including the possibility of using advanced tunneling technologies to overcome objections by South Pasadena. The gap will no longer be constructed, and both Pasadena and Alhambra are exploring options on the future of their respective spurs.\nAt the eastern end of the San Gabriel Valley, the eastern freeway segment of SR 210 (formerly designated SR 30 and still signed as such in some places in San Bernardino County) between SR 57 and I-15 had been a source of similar contention in the bordering community of La Verne, but was finally constructed and added to the Foothill Freeway in 2002.\nState Route 39 leads north into the San Gabriel Mountains to the Crystal Lake Recreation Area. The portion connecting the recreation area to the Angeles Crest Highway (State Route 2) has been closed to the public since the early 1970s due to massive damage and rockslides.\nGeneral aviation is served by San Gabriel Valley Airport (EMT) in El Monte, and Brackett Field (POC) in Pomona. Commercial aviation is served by the five major Southern California airports: Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), Hollywood Burbank Airport (BUR), Ontario International Airport (ONT), Long Beach Airport (LGB), and John Wayne Airport (SNA).\n\n\n== Local media ==\n\n\n=== Newspapers and online media ===\nSee also Los Angeles Times suburban sectionsThe local daily English-language newspapers are The Los Angeles Times, which includes a real estate and automotive advertising section for the San Gabriel Valley/Inland Empire, the San Gabriel Valley Tribune, and the Pasadena Star-News, which operates from its Monrovia office. The Pasadena Star-News covers the Pasadena/Arcadia area and the Tribune covers the central and eastern San Gabriel Valley communities. Business news is covered by the San Gabriel Valley Business Journal.\nOther San Gabriel Valley-wide publications include the weekly Mountain Views News and the San Gabriel Valley Examiner  that serve the foothill communities, the Mid Valley News which serves the central San Gabriel Valley, and the Beacon Media weekly newspaper chain, whose weekly newspapers cover several San Gabriel Valley cities. The South Pasadena Review serves South Pasadena and the San Marino Tribune serves San Marino. Additionally, the cities of Alhambra, Glendora, Azusa, San Dimas and La Verne have monthly community newspapers that are published on the first Friday of every month. These papers include Around Alhambra, Glendora Community News, Azusa Community News, San Dimas Community News and the La Verne Community News, all ddistributed directly to each mailing address. The Alhambra Source is a USC Annenberg-backed community news site founded in 2010. The site is based on research into local information need, and includes a multilingual cadre of volunteer and young adult contributors. It is published online every weekday and includes select content in Spanish and Chinese as well as English. In the eastern part of the valley, Claremont has its own community newspaper called the Claremont Courier.\nSeveral large newspaper publishing companies serve the large Chinese-speaking readership in the Greater Los Angeles Area; a number of them are based in the San Gabriel Valley. The national daily Chinese-language newspapers Chinese Daily News (Los Angeles edition of the World Journal newspaper) and International Daily News are both printed in Monterey Park. The Los Angeles edition of the Hong Kong-based Sing Tao is printed in Alhambra and the newspaper is specifically tailored to the Cantonese-speaking readership. The Epoch Times (\u5927\u7eaa\u5143) is based in New York City and has its Los Angeles office in San Gabriel. These newspapers are circulated and distributed throughout Chinese American communities in the San Gabriel Valley, Chinatown, San Diego, and in Las Vegas, Nevada (where the latter two cities generally receive the Los Angeles editions due to a relatively lower population density of Chinese-speaking Americans).\n\n\n=== Filming locations ===\nSeveral blockbuster Hollywood films have been filmed on location in the San Gabriel Valley. Chantry Flats above Arcadia is featured as the landing site of aliens in the original film \"War of the Worlds\". South Pasadena and Alhambra served as the gloomy backgrounds of a fictional Illinois town of Haddonfield in John Carpenter's 1978 horror film Halloween. Some areas of Pasadena and South Pasadena have a distinctly Midwestern look. Pasadena's distinctive domed City Hall has doubled as a courthouse or capitol building in countless television commercials and movies, and its South Lake shopping district filled in for Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills Ninja.\n\nThe city of San Marino has taken acted as a backdrop for a number of films and television shows. Major studio motion pictures filmed in San Marino include Mr. & Mrs, Smith, Disturbia, Enough, Monster-in-Law, Memoirs of a Geisha, Frailty, Men in Black II, The Hot Chick, One Hour Photo, Anger Management, The Wedding Planner, Starsky & Hutch, Intolerable Cruelty, Mystery Men, Legally Blonde 2, The Nutty Professor, Beverly Hills Ninja, The Sweetest Thing, S1m0ne, Charlie's Angels, Indecent Proposal, and American Wedding. Prime time television programs filmed within city borders include Felicity, The Office, The West Wing, and Alias. In addition, San Marino High School students in the graduating classes of 2004 and 2005 were documented in two separate reality television programs by MTV, which aired on the cable television network in 2005.\nThe cities of Temple City and Rosemead served as the backdrop for the Emmy Award-winning television series The Wonder Years (1988 to 1993). While Temple City's Las Tunas Drive served as the downtown for the Arnold Family's fictitious hometown, Rosemead High School stood in for the town's high school. Downtown Covina was used in the show \"Roswell.\"\nThe city of Whittier also hosts film crews for various motion picture, television and feature films. In Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future trilogy of time travel adventure movies (1985, 1989, 1990), Whittier High School was used as Hill Valley High School. Michael J. Fox's character travels back in time on the huge parking lot of the Puente Hills Mall in the City of Industry that served as the location of the fictitious Twin Pines Mall/Lone Pine Mall. The Gamble House in Pasadena provided the exterior of Christopher Lloyd's character's 1950s mansion. The city of El Monte served as a dilapidated future neighborhood. Another movie starring Fox, Teen Wolf. was largely filmed in Arcadia. The Pasadena Chapter building of the Red Cross served as JAG Headquarters for the TV series JAG, and the Caltech campus is regularly seen as the \"Cal Sci\" campus in the TV series Numb3rs. The actual house used as the residence of the main characters is also located in the southern end of Pasadena. Uptown Whittier was a principal location for the 1987 release Masters of the Universe, and many scenes of the film show the buildings of the neighborhood as they appeared before most of them were damaged or destroyed by the Whittier Narrows earthquake of that year. Forrest Gump (1994), starring Tom Hanks, was partially filmed at East Los Angeles College in Monterey Park. The downtown portion of Myrtle Avenue in Monrovia has been used in many movies and television commercials. Multiple locations throughout Monrovia also played the role of the fictitious Rome, WI in the TV series Picket Fences.Pinky's Record Store in Friday; The 90s television show Roswell filmed in Covina, most noticeably the downtown area. Most recently, the former location of a now closed IKEA in the City of Industry was used to film scenes in the movie Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), starring Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. Across the street from the defunct IKEA is Speed Zone, an amusement center with 4 race tracks, it has been featured in the films Guess Who and Clerks 2 and on TV in Melrose Place (2009 TV series), CSI: Miami, Hell's Kitchen, Attack of the Show!, Freaks And Geeks, and more.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nLike much of the Los Angeles region, the San Gabriel Valley enjoys a warm, sunny, and Mediterranean climate year-round. Rain is sporadic. Due to the Eastern San Gabriel Valley, (East of State Route 57) being more inland, the area is subject to hotter summers and colder winters. Light snow is extremely rare in the Valley but can often be viewed on the nearby San Gabriel Mountains.\n\n\n== Institutions of higher learning ==\nThe San Gabriel Valley is home to a number of post-secondary educational institutions, including the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), the Claremont Colleges, and California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (Cal Poly Pomona).\"\n\n\n== Local sites of interest ==\n\n\n== Company headquarters ==\nAvery Dennison Corporation (packaging products) \u2013 Pasadena\nCommunity Bank \u2013 Pasadena\nEast West Bank (large Chinese American bank) \u2013 Pasadena\nEdison International (large energy provider) \u2013 Rosemead\nHuy Fong Foods (leader in Asian hot sauce) \u2013 Irwindale\nOneWest Bank \u2013 Pasadena\nViewsonic (computer monitors) \u2013 Walnut\nPanda Restaurant Group (Largest Chinese Restaurant chain) \u2013 Rosemead\nTrader Joe's (food market) \u2013 Monrovia\nWestern Asset (investment firm) \u2013 Pasadena\n\n\n== Area codes ==\nMost of the San Gabriel Valley lies within the 626 area code. Montebello, Whittier, and portions of its valley neighbors are in the 323 and 562 area codes. Some of northwestern Pasadena is also serviced by the 818 area code. Most of the communities in the Eastern San Gabriel Valley which lie east of State Route 57 are located in the 909 area code.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCategory: San Gabriel Valley\nGreater Los Angeles Area\nPomona Valley\nSan Gabriel Mountains Regional Conservancy\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSan Gabriel Valley Conservation and Service Corps\nSan Gabriel Valley Economic Partnership\nSan Gabriel Valley Council of Governments",

        "wiki": "The City of San Marino (Italian: Citt\u00e0 di San Marino) (also known simply as San Marino or locally as Citt\u00e0) is the capital city of the Republic of San Marino, Southern Europe. The city has a population of 4,044. It is on the western slopes of San Marino's highest point, Monte Titano.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAlthough not the capital, most of the businesses are in Borgo Maggiore. It is the third largest city in the country, after Dogana and Borgo Maggiore. It borders the San Marino municipalities Acquaviva, Borgo Maggiore, Fiorentino, and Chiesanuova and the Italian municipality San Leo.\nAkademio Internacia de la Sciencoj San Marino is centered here.\n\n\n== History ==\nDue to its being the capital and previously the only city in San Marino, the history of this city is almost the same as the History of San Marino. For more information on that topic, see that article.\nThe city was founded by Saint Marinus and several Christian refugees in the year 301. From then on the city became a center of Christian refugees who fled from Roman persecution.\nThe urban heart of the city was protected by three towers: the first, Guaita, constructed in the 11th century, was famous for being impenetrable, which to a great extent discouraged attacks on the city.\nDue to the Crusades, it was felt necessary to construct a second tower, Cesta (13th century). But the Sanmarinense defensive system was not completed until the construction of a third tower, the Montale (14th century) - the smallest of all and constructed on the last of the summits of Monte Titano.\nWith the population of the city increasing, the territory of the country was extended by a few square kilometers. Since the Sanmarinese policy was not to invade or to use war to obtain new territories, it was by means of purchases and treaties that San Marino obtained the other eight castelli which make up San Marino.\n\n\n== Parishes ==\nThe City of San Marino has the following 7 parishes or wards (curazie):\nC\u00e0 Berlone, Canepa, Casole, Castellaro, Montalbo, Murata, Santa Mustiola\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of the city of San Marino has always been closely bound to that of the country. Until recently, the main economic activities of the locality were stone extraction and carving. Today, there is a more varied economy, including tourism, commerce, sale of postage stamps, and a small agricultural industry, although the latter is in decline.\n\n\n=== Landmarks ===\n\nThe city is visited by more than three million people per year, and has developed progressively as a tourist centre. Of the tourists, 85% are Italian. There are also more than a thousand retail outlets, where one can find a great variety of products.\n\n\n==== Main sights ====\nBasilica di San Marino\nPalazzo dei Capitani\nPalazzo Pubblico\nTeatro Titano\nThe Three Towers of San Marino\nPiazza del Titano\nPiazza Garibaldi\nMonastery of Santa Clara\nGrand Hotel San Marino\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nThe town is known for its long, winding cobblestoned streets, as its altitude and steep approach put it beyond the reach of the San Marino Superhighway. San Marino is also notable in that cars are prohibited in much of the town center.\nBefore the Second World War, a railway was built from San Marino to Rimini under the dictatorship of Benito Mussolini. Its tunnels, and the railway station 'Piazzale Lo Stradone', still exist. Proposals for the reopening of this railway have been presented to the government on several occasions, but thus far without action.\nThere is a regular bus service to Rimini, and a 1.5 kilometres (0.9 miles) cable car line connects the capital with Borgo Maggiore.\nA series of lifts also connects the upper part of town with the lower.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe city of San Marino has two football teams: the S.S. Murata and the S.P. Tre Penne. The city had the Olympic Flame pass through San Marino during the run-up to the 2006 Winter Olympics.\n\n\n== Photogallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns\u2014Sister cities ===\nThe City of San Marino is twinned with: \n\n San Leo, Italy\n Rab, Croatia\n R\u00f8nne, Denmark\n Scranton, Pennsylvania, United States\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to San Marino (city) at Wikimedia Commons\n\n(in Italian) San Marino's page on giuntedicastello.sm",

          "After a steep but short climb and then a slightly higher ticket price than I expected (\u20ac8), I was prepared to be disappointed but was instead delighted. You can visit a great deal of the castle, climbing in and out of prison cells and living areas, and the views from all over",

        "wiki": "The Castle of Sant'Aniceto (also San Niceto) is a Byzantine castle built in the early 11th century on a hill in Motta San Giovanni, now in the province of Reggio Calabria, southern Italy.\nIt is one of the few examples of High Middle Ages architecture in Calabria, as well as one of the few well-preserved Byzantine fortifications in the world. The name derives from that of St. Nicetas, a Byzantine admiral who lived in the 7th-8th centuries.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe castle was built as a refuge and a warning place during a period in which the ravages of Saracen pirates on the Calabrian and Sicilian coasts were frequent. When the Normans conquered southern Italy, the structure was enlarged, with the addition of rectangular towers.\nIn the 13th century the castle became the command center of the flourishing fief of Sant'Aniceto (which included Motta San Giovanni and Montebello). Two centuries later, entered in conflict with Reggio Calabria, and in 1459 it was destroyed by Alfonso of Calabria.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe castles has an irregular plan, which reminds that of a ship with the bow directed towards the mountains and the aft to the sea.\nNest to the entrance are two square towers. At the feet of the short steep path leading to the plain below is a small church, which has a frescoed dome portraying the Christ Pantokrator, a typical subject of Byzantine Art.\nThe height of the well-preserved walls varies from 3 to 3.5 meters, and they are some one meters thick.\n\n\n== References ==\nDe Lorenzo, A.

Located on the three peaks of Monte Titano in the capital, also called San Marino, they are depicted on both the national flag and coat of arms. \n\n\n== First Tower ==\nThe Guaita is the oldest of the three towers, and the most famous. It was constructed in the 11th century and served briefly as a prison.  It was rebuilt numerous times and reached its current form in the 15th century during the war fought between San Marino and the House of Malatesta.\n\n\n== Second Tower ==\nThe Cesta  is located on the highest of Monte Titano's summits. A museum to honour Saint Marinus, created in 1956, is located in this tower and showcases over 1,550 weapons dating from the Medieval Era to the modern day. It was constructed in the 13th century on the remains of an older Roman fort.\n\n\n== Third Tower ==\n\nThe Montale is located on the smallest of Monte Titano's summits. Unlike the other towers, this one is not open to the public. It was constructed in the 14th century. It is thought to have been constructed to give protection against the increasing power of the Malatesta family in that region.  It was also used as a prison, and accordingly, the only entrance to the tower is a door about seven metres from ground level, which was common for prison architecture of the time.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Rimini ( RIM-in-ee, Italian: [\u02c8ri\u02d0mini] (listen); Romagnol: R\u00e9min; Latin: Ariminum) is a city in the Emilia-Romagna region of northern Italy and capital city of the Province of Rimini. It sprawls along the Adriatic Sea, on the coast between the rivers Marecchia (the ancient Ariminus) and Ausa (ancient Aprusa). It is one of the most notable seaside resorts in Europe with revenue from both internal and international tourism forming a significant portion of the city's economy. The first bathing establishment opened in 1843. Rimini is an art city with ancient Roman and Renaissance monuments, and is also the birthplace of the famous film director Federico Fellini.\nThe city was founded by the Romans in 268 BC. Throughout Roman times, Rimini was a key communications link between the north and south of the peninsula. On its soil, Roman emperors erected monuments such as the Arch of Augustus and the Tiberius Bridge to mark the beginning and the end of the Decumanus of Rimini. During the Renaissance, the city benefited from the court of the House of Malatesta, which hosted artists like Leonardo da Vinci and produced works such as the Tempio Malatestiano. The main monuments in Rimini are the Tiberius Bridge and the Arch of Augustus.\nIn the 19th century, Rimini was one of the most active cities on the revolutionary front, hosting many of the movements seeking to achieve Italian unification. In the course of World War II, the city was the scene of numerous clashes and bombings, but also of a fierce partisan resistance that earned it the honour of a gold medal for civic valour. In recent years it has become one of the most important sites for trade fairs and conferences in Italy.\nAs of 31 May 2019, Rimini's urban area was home to 150,951 people, with approximately 325,000 living in the eponymous province, making it the twenty-eighth largest city in Italy.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient history ===\n\nThe area was part of the Etruscan civilization until the arrival of the Celts, who held it from the 6th century BC until their defeat by the Umbri in 283 BC. In 268 BC at the mouth of the Ariminus (now called the Marecchia), the Roman Republic founded the colonia of Ariminum.\nThe city was involved in the civil wars but remained faithful to the popular party and to its leaders, firstly Gaius Marius, and then Julius Caesar. After crossing the Rubicon, the latter made his legendary appeal to the legions in the Forum of Rimini.\nAriminum was seen as a bastion against invaders from Celts and also as a springboard for conquering the Padana plain. As the terminus of the Via Flaminia, which ended in the town at the surviving prestigious Arch of Augustus (erected 27 BC), Rimini was a road junction connecting central and northern Italy by the Via Aemilia that led to Piacenza and the Via Popilia that extended northwards; it also opened up trade by sea and river. Remains of the amphitheatre that could seat 12,000 people, and a five-arched bridge of Istrian stone completed by Tiberius (21 AD) are still visible. Later Galla Placidia built the church of Santo Stefano. The evidence that Rimini is of Roman origins is illustrated by the city being divided by two main streets, the Cardo and the Decumanus.\nThe end of Roman rule was marked by destruction caused by invasions and wars, but also by the establishment of the palaces of the Imperial officers and the first churches, the symbol of the spread of Christianity that held the important Council of Ariminum in the city in 359.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nWhen the Ostrogoths conquered Rimini in 493, Odoacer, besieged in Ravenna, had to capitulate. During the Gothic War (535\u2013554), Rimini was taken and retaken many times. In its vicinity the Byzantine general Narses overthrew (553) the Alamanni. Under the Byzantine rule, it belonged to the Pentapolis, part of the Exarchate of Ravenna.\nIn 728, it was taken with many other cities by Liutprand, King of the Lombards but returned to the Byzantines about 735. Pepin the Short gave it to the Holy See, but during the wars of the popes and the Italian cities against the emperors, Rimini sided with the latter.\nIn the 13th century, it suffered from the discords of the Gambacari and Ansidei families. The city became a municipality in the 14th century, and with the arrival of the religious orders, numerous convents and churches were built, providing work for many illustrious artists. In fact, Giotto inspired the 14th-century School of Rimini, which was the expression of original cultural ferment.\nThe House of Malatesta emerged from the struggles between municipal factions with Malatesta da Verucchio, who in 1239 was named podest\u00e0 (chief magistrate) of the city. Despite interruptions, his family held authority until 1528. In 1312 he was succeeded by Malatestino Malatesta, first signore (lord) of the city and Pandolfo I Malatesta, the latter's brother, named by Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, as imperial vicar of Romagna. Ferrantino, son of Malatesta II (1335), was opposed by his cousin Ramberto and by Cardinal Bertrand du Pouget (1331), legate of Pope John XXII. Malatesta II was also lord of Pesaro. He was succeeded by Malatesta Ungaro (1373) and Galeotto I Malatesta, uncle of the former (1385), lord also of Fano (from 1340), Pesaro, and Cesena (1378).\nHis son Carlo I Malatesta, one of the most respected condottieri of the time, enlarged the Riminese possessions and restored the port. Carlo died childless in 1429, and the lordship was divided into three parts, Rimini going to Galeotto Roberto Malatesta, a Catholic zealot who turned out to be totally inadequate for the role. The Pesarese line of the Malatestas tried, in fact, to take advantage of his weakness and to capture the city, but Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, Carlo's nephew, who was only 14 at the time, intervened to save it. Galeotto retired to a convent, and Sigismondo obtained the rule of Rimini.\nSigismondo Pandolfo was the most famous lord of Rimini. In 1433, Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, sojourned in the city and for a while he was the commander-in-chief of the Papal armies. A skilled general, Sigismondo often acted as condottiero for other states to gain money to embellish it (he was also a dilettante poet). He had the famous Tempio Malatestiano rebuilt by Leon Battista Alberti. However, after the rise of Pope Pius II, he had to fight constantly for the independence of the city. In 1463 he was forced to submit to Pius II, who left him only Rimini and little more; Roberto Malatesta, his son (1482), under Pope Paul II, nearly lost his state, but under Pope Sixtus IV, became the commanding officer of the pontifical army against Ferdinand of Naples. Sigismondo was, however, defeated by Neapolitan forces in the battle of Campomorto (1482). Pandolfo IV, his son (1500), lost Rimini to Cesare Borgia, after whose overthrow it fell to Venice (1503\u20131509), but it was later retaken by Pope Julius II and incorporated into the Papal States. After the death of Pope Leo X, Pandolfo returned for several months, and with his son Sigismondo Malatesta held a rule which looked tyrannous even for the time. Pope Adrian VI expelled him again and gave Rimini to the Duke of Urbino, the pope's vicar in Romagna. In 1527 Sigismondo managed to regain the city, but in the following year the Malatesta dominion died forever.\n\n\n=== Renaissance and Enlightment ===\n\nAt the beginning of the 16th century, Rimini, now a secondary town of the Papal States, was ruled by an Apostolic Legate. Towards the end of the 16th century, the municipal square (now Piazza Cavour), which had been closed off on a site where the Poletti Theatre was subsequently built, was redesigned. The statue of Pope Paul V has stood in the centre of the square next to the fountain since 1614.\nIn the 16th century, the 'grand square' (now the Piazza Tre Martiri in honor of three civilians hanged by the retreating Nazis at the end of World War II), which was where markets and tournaments were held, underwent various changes. A small temple dedicated to Saint Anthony of Padua and a clock tower were built there, giving the square its present shape and size.\nUntil the 18th century raiding armies, earthquakes, famines, floods and pirate attacks ravaged the city. In this gloomy situation and due to a weakened local economy, fishing took on great importance, a fact testified by the construction of structures such as the fish market and the lighthouse.\nIn 1797, Rimini, along with the rest of Romagna, was affected by the passage of the Napoleonic army and became part of the Cisalpine Republic. Napoleonic policy suppressed the monastic orders, confiscating their property and thus dispersing a substantial heritage, and demolished many churches including the ancient cathedral of Santa Colomba.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nOn 30 March 1815, Joachim Murat launched his Rimini Proclamation to the Italian people from here, hoping to incite them to unity and independence. In 1845, a band of adventurers commanded by Ribbotti entered the city and proclaimed a constitution which was soon abolished. In 1860, Rimini and Romagna were incorporated into the Kingdom of Italy.\nThe city was transformed after the 1843 founding of the first bathing establishment and the Kursaal, a building constructed to host sumptuous social events, became the symbol of Rimini's status as a tourist resort. In just a few years, the seafront underwent considerable development work making Rimini 'the city of small villas'. At the beginning of the 20th century, The Grand Hotel, the city's first major accommodation facility, was built near the beach.\nDuring the first World War, Rimini and its surrounding infrastructure was one of the primary targets of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. After Italy's declaration of war on 15 May 1915, the Austro-Hungarian fleet left its harbours the same day and started its assault on the Adriatic coast between Venice and Barletta.\nDuring World War II, the city was torn apart by heavy bombardments and by the passage of the front over the Gothic Line during the Battle of Rimini and was eventually captured by Greek and Canadian forces. Following its liberation on September 21, 1944, reconstruction work began, culminating in huge development of the tourist industry in the city.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nRimini is situated at 44\u00b003\u203200\u2033 north and 12\u00b034\u203200\u2033 east, along the coast of the Adriatic sea, at the southeastern edge of Emilia-Romagna, at a short distance from Montefeltro and Marche. Rimini extends for 135.71 square km and borders the municipalities of Bellaria-Igea Marina, San Mauro Pascoli, and Santarcangelo di Romagna towards NW, Verucchio and Serravalle towards SW, Coriano towards S, and Riccione towards SE. The city is also located at the intersection of three Roman roads: Via Emilia, Via Popilia, and Via Flaminia. Viserba is the most important of Rimini's northern districts, with 8,556 inhabitants.\nRimini is located in a historically strategic position, at the extreme southern edge of the Po Valley, at the junction point of Northern and Central Italy.\nIt is surrounded towards southwest by the gently rolling hills of Covignano (153 metres high), Vergiano (81 m), San Martino Monte l'Abbate (57 m) and San Lorenzo in Correggiano (60 m), widely cultivated, with vineyards, olive groves and orchards, and dominated by ancient mansions. These hills, mostly made of clay and sand, connect the plains, created by the Marecchia and Ausa, the two most important rivers of Rimini territory, to the higher hills of the Apennines.\nThe Marecchia river runs through its valley and the plain in a very large riverbed and, after confluence with the Ausa, it flows into the Adriatic sea through a deviator between San Giuliano Mare and Rivabella, while the ancient riverbed is used in its last section as the city's harbour.\nThe Marecchia, usually with little water flow, was subjected to periodic, destructive floods near its mouth, where the riverbed became narrow after various bends: for this reason it was deviated north.  Ausa creek, which was the eastern limit of Rimini for many centuries, was deviated as well after World War II, and its original riverbed was filled and turned into an urban park.\nThe coastal strip, made of recent marine deposits, is edged by a fine sandy beach, 15 km long and up to 200 metres wide, interrupted only by the mouth of the rivers and gently shelving towards the sea. Along the coastline there is a low sandy cliff, created by sea rise around 4000 B.C., partly conserved north of Rimini, between Rivabella and Bellaria-Igea Marina, at a distance of about 1,300 metres from the coast.Rimini's territory, for its geographical position and its climatic features, is situated on the edge between the mediterranean and the central European phytoclimatic zones, and thus it represents an environment of notable naturalistic value.\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nRimini is the main centre of a 50 kilometres (31 miles) long coastal conurbation, which extends from Cervia to Gabicce Mare, including the seaside resorts of Cesenatico, Gatteo a Mare, Bellaria-Igea Marina, Riccione, Misano Adriatico and Cattolica. The conurbation has about 300,000 inhabitants and originated around the mid-20th century due to urban sprawl following intensive tourism development.\nThe city of Rimini includes the seaside localities and districts of Torre Pedrera, Viserbella, Viserba, Rivabella, San Giuliano Mare towards north and Bellariva, Marebello, Rivazzurra, Miramare towards south. These districts are important to tourism in Rimini.\nThe city proper includes the historic centre, the four ancient boroughs of S. Giuliano, S. Giovanni, S. Andrea and Marina, the seaside district of Marina Centro and various modern districts\u2014Celle, Marecchiese, INA Casa, V PEEP, Colonnella, Lagomaggio\u2014and outer suburbs such as Padulli, Spadarolo, Covignano, Grottarossa and Villaggio 1\u00b0 Maggio, located outside of the Adriatic Highway beltline. More outer suburbs are S. Giustina, S. Vito, Spadarolo, Vergiano, Corpol\u00f2 and Gaiofana.\nThe historic centre of Rimini, surrounded by the city walls built by Malatesta, and formerly bounded by the Marecchia and Ausa rivers, has a distinctive, regular urban structure of Roman origins. It was divided since the Middle Ages in four districts (Rioni): Cittadella, Clodio, Pomposo and Montecavallo. The boundaries of these districts are not known, but it is assumed that they followed the current Corso d'Augusto, Via Garibaldi, and Via Gambalunga. Additionally, the ancient coastline was situated much farther inland than today's; it gradually shifted outward over centuries and the new land was developed throughout the 20th century.Rione Cittadella, in the western area of the centre, was the most important district of the city and included the Municipal palaces, Castel Sismondo and the Cathedral of Santa Colomba. Rione Clodio, towards the north, was popular and a peculiar urban structure tied with the near Marecchia river. Rione Pomposo, the widest district of the city, included large orchards and convents. Rione Montecavallo, on the southern part of the historical centre, is characterized by bowed, irregular streets of medieval origins, by the Fossa Patara creek and a small hill called \"Montirone\".Outside of the city walls, there are four boroughs (Borghi), which were entirely incorporated to the city by the urban sprawl in early 20th century.Borgo S. Giuliano, along Via Emilia, dates back to the 11th century and was originally a fishermen's settlement. Dominated by the Church of San Giuliano, it is one of the most picturesque spots of the city, with narrow streets and squares, colourful small houses and many frescoes representing characters and places of Federico Fellini's films.\nBorgo S. Giovanni, on both sides of Via Flaminia, was populated by artisans and middle-class; Borgo S. Andrea, located outside of Porta Montanara, along Via Covignano, Via Montefeltro and Via Monte Titano, was strictly tied with agriculture and commerce of cows. Both these two boroughs were developed in 15th century; then they burned in a fire in 1469 and were rebuilt in 19th century, relocating small industries and manufactures, including a brick factory and a phosphorus matches factory.\nBorgo Marina, situated on the right bank of the Marecchia, was a portual borough, heavily transformed by Fascist demolitions and World War II bombings, which hit this area due to the proximity to the bridges of the city and the railway station.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nRimini has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa) moderated by the influence of the Adriatic sea, featuring the highest autumn and winter mean temperatures and the highest annual low temperatures in Emilia-Romagna.Precipitations are equally distributed during the year, with a peak in October (75 mm) and two slight minimums, in January (42 mm) and July (43 mm). In spring, autumn and winter precipitations mainly come from oceanic fronts, while in summer they are brought by thunderstorms, coming from the Apennines or the Po Valley.\nHumidity is high all year round, with a minimum of 72% in June and July and a maximum of 84% in November and December. Prevailing winds blow from W, S, E and NE. Southwesterly winds, known as libeccio or garbino, are foehn winds, which may bring warm temperatures in each season. On average, there are over 2,040 sunshine hours per year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nAs of 2019, Rimini has 150,951 inhabitants, with a density of about 1,100 inhabitants per square kilometre within the city limits.\nIn 1861, by the time of the first Italian census, the population was around 28,000; in 1931 it was more than double, 57,000.\nWith the increasing tourism development, population rapidly grew between 1951 and 1981, the fastest growing period for Rimini in the 20th century, when the city's population grew from 77,000 to over 128,000.During the 20th century, two former districts of Rimini got administrative autonomy, causing two distinct temporary drops in population totals: Riccione in 1922 and Bellaria-Igea Marina in 1956.\nForeign population is 18,396, (12.5% of the total), mainly from Eastern Europe, East Asia and North Africa. Between 1992 and 2014, foreign population grew from around 1,800 to over 18,000 units. \nThe most important foreign communities are Albanians (3,479), Romanians (2,904), Ukrainians (2,409), Chinese (1,197) and Moldovans (1,023). Other notable foreign groups in the city are Senegalese, Moroccans, Macedonians, Tunisians, Russians, Bangladeshis and Peruvians.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nRimini's population is mostly Catholic. The city is the seat of the Diocese of Rimini, a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Ravenna-Cervia.\nThe first cathedral of the diocese was the former Cathedral of Santa Colomba until 1798, when the title was transferred to the church of Sant'Agostino. Since 1809, Rimini's cathedral is the Tempio Malatestiano.\nBesides Roman Catholic churches, there are also Orthodox, Evangelical and Adventist churches. Between the 13th and 14th century, Rimini had a flourishing Jewish community, which built three distinct synagogues, all destroyed, formerly located around the area of Piazza Cavour, Via Cairoli and Santa Colomba.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nRimini is a major international tourist destination and seaside resort, among the most famous ones in Europe and the Mediterranean basin, thanks to a long sandy beach, well-equipped bathing establishments, theme parks and a number of opportunities for leisure and spare time. The economy of the city is entirely based on tourism, whose development started in the first half of the 19th century and increased after World War II.\nRimini's origins as a seaside resort date back to 1843, when the first \"Bathing Establishment\" was founded, the oldest one of the Adriatic Sea. The width of the beach, the gentle gradient of the sea bed, the equipment of bathing establishments, the luxurious hotels, the mildness of the climate, the richness of curative waters, the prestigious social events, made Rimini a renowned tourist destination among the Italian and European aristocracy.\n\nTourism in Rimini started as therapeutic stay (thalassotherapy, hydrotherapy and heliotherapy), evolving into elite vacation in the late 19th century, into middle-class tourism during the fascist era and finally into mass tourism in the postwar period.On summer nights, there is a festival called \"La Notte Rosa\".\nRimini concentrates a quarter of Emilia-Romagna's hotels, with over 1,000 hotels, 300 of which are open all year round, and hundreds of apartment hotels, apartments, holiday homes, bed & breakfast and campings. Tourism is mainly based on seaside holidays, but also includes trade fairs and conventions, events, nightlife, culture, wellness, food and wine.\nRimini is a leading trade fair and convention site in Italy, with an important trade fair (Rimini Fiera) and a convention centre (Palacongressi di Rimini).\nThe city's other economic sectors, such as services, commerce, construction industry, have been influenced by the development of tourism. Commerce is one of the main economic sectors, thanks to the presence of a large wholesale center, two hypermarkets, department stores, supermarkets and hundreds of shops and boutiques. Industry, less developed than tourism and services, includes various companies active in food industry, woodworking machineries, building constructions, furnishing, clothing and publishing. Notable companies are Bimota (motorcycles), SCM (woodworking machines), Trevi S.p.A. (electronic goods). Rimini is also seat of a historic railway works plant.Agriculture and fishing were the city's main economic sources until the early 20th century. Rimini boasts an important tradition in wine production (Sangiovese, Trebbiano, Rebola, Pagadebit, Albana wines) and an historic extra virgin olive oil production. The most common crops of the area, besides vineyards and olive groves, are orchards (peaches, nectarines, apricots, persimmons, apples, pears, cherries, kiwifruits and plums), vegetables and legumes (lettuce, zucchini, potatoes, tomatoes, beans, green beans, cauliflowers, fennels, strawberries), seminatives (wheat, barley, grain sorghum, corn, oat), sunflowers and canola. The fishing industry can count on a fleet of about 100 fishing boats, the most consistent of Rimini's fishing department, which includes the coast between Cattolica and Cesenatico.\n\n\n== Arts and culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe City Museum (Museo della Citt\u00e0), main museal institution of Rimini, was inaugurated as \"Archaeology Gallery\", at the ground floor of Palazzo Gambalunga in 1872, thanks to Riminese historian Luigi Tonini, active in researching and studying the local archaeological heritage. The Archaeology Gallery was the first museum of the city and was conceived as a collection of Etruscan civilization and Roman antiquities, found in Rimini and in the surrounding countryside.\nThe civic museum was arranged in San Francesco monastery in 1923 and in 1938 was enlarged with a section of Medieval Art. The objects avoided the destructions of World War II, being moved between 1940 and 1943 to two different shelters in Spadarolo and Novafeltria. In 1964, the collections were moved to Palazzo Visconti and finally, from 1990, to the Collegio dei Gesuiti, a large Jesuit convent designed by bolognese architect Alfonso Torreggiani, built in 1749.\n\nIn the Archaeological department are exhibited grave goods from Villanovian tombs of Verucchio and Covignano, architectural pieces, sculptures, mosaics, ceramics, coins of Republican and Imperial eras, and the exceptional medical kit from the Domus del Chirurgo. The collection of the Roman Lapidary, exhibited in the inner courtyard of the convent, has funerary monuments, epigraphies and milestones.\nThe Medieval and Modern Art departments include collections of paintings, sculptures and art objects by artists from Romagna (Giovanni da Rimini, Giuliano da Rimini, Guido Cagnacci), Emilia (Guercino, Vittorio Maria Bigari), Tuscany (Domenico Ghirlandaio, Agostino di Duccio) and Veneto (Giovanni Bellini), from 14th to 19th century. The City Museum arranges temporary exhibitions and promotes researches, study and restoration activities of the city's historical and artistic heritage.\nThe Fellini Museum (Museo Fellini), dedicated to Federico Fellini, houses temporary exhibitions of documents, drawings, scenographies and costumes related to the movie production of the famous film director.The Museum of Glances (Museo degli Sguardi), housed in Villa Alvarado, on Covignano hill, was instituted in 2005 acquiring the objects of the former Museum of Extra European Cultures \"Dinz Rialto\", founded in Rimini in 1972 by explorer Delfino Dinz Rialto, the art pieces of the former Missionary Museum of the Grazie and other private collections. The museum has over 3,000 objects coming from China, Oceania, Africa and pre-Columbian America, with paintings, sculptures, everyday objects, totems, masks, musical instruments and clothes illustrating how the Western world has looked at these territories' cultures through history.\nThe Museum of Small Fishing and Marine (Museo della Piccola Pesca e della Marineria), in Viserbella, shows the history of Rimini's Marine through a collection of boats, fishing tools, photographs and a large seashells collection, with pieces from all over the Mediterranean Sea.In the municipality of Rimini there are also two private museums: the Aviation Museum (Museo dell'Aviazione) in Sant'Aquilina, close to the boundary of the Republic of San Marino, and the National Museum of Motorcycle (Museo Nazionale del Motociclo) in Casalecchio.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nThe Gambalunghiana Library, historic institution founded in 1617 by jurist Alessandro Gambalunga, plays a leading role in the city's cultural life. The library has over 280,000 books, including 60,000 ancient books, 1,350 manuscripts, 6,000 prints and 80,000 photographs. Among the incunables, dated back from the 15th century, stand out De Claris mulieribus (1497) by Giacomo Filippo Foresti and De re militari by Roberto Valturio. The collection of illuminated manuscripts, coming from different cultural and linguistic European boundaries, includes the Regalis Historia by Frate Leonardo and De Civitate Dei by Saint Augustine.\n\n\n=== Theatre and Films ===\n\nThe first stable theatre in Rimini is documented since 1681, when the city council decided on the transformation of the Arengo's main hall into a large theatre hall, hosting shows of amateur dramatics companies and the young Carlo Goldoni, who was studying philosophy in the city at that time.\nBetween 1842 and 1857 the great Municipal Theatre Vittorio Emanuele II was built, designed in Neoclassical style by the architect Luigi Poletti, according to the traditional canons of the 19th-century Italian theatre. The theatre was inaugurated by Giuseppe Verdi, who directed \"L'Aroldo\", and hosted prestigious opera seasons until its destruction in 1943 due to aerial bombings. Since 1947, it has been called Amintore Galli Theatre. Since its closure, theatre shows has been hosted in the modern Teatro Ermete Novelli in Marina Centro.\nRimini appeared on the movie screen for the first time in some early footages, such as the documentary \"Rimini l'Ostenda d'Italia\" (1912), and in various Istituto Luce's newsreels in the Thirties. The film director Federico Fellini, was born and raised in Rimini, portrayed characters, places and atmospheres of his hometown through his movies, which however were almost entirely shot in Cinecitt\u00e0's studios in Rome: I Vitelloni, 8 e \u00bd (Oscar award in 1964), I clowns, Amarcord (Oscar award in 1975). Other Italian movies filmed in Rimini includes \"La prima notte di quiete\" by Valerio Zurlini, \"Rimini Rimini\" by Sergio Corbucci, \"Abbronzatissimi\" by Bruno Gaburro, \"Sole negli occhi\" by Andrea Porporati, \"Da zero a dieci\" by Luciano Ligabue and \"Non pensarci\" by Gianni Zanasi.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe earliest musician from Rimini was Saint Arduino (10th century); a musical tradition of some distinction was witnessed in the following century by the presence of a music school, named \"Scuola cantorum\", at the Cathedral of Santa Colomba. French composer Guillaume Dufay stayed in Rimini, at Malatesta's court until 1427. In 1518 Pietro Aaron became the first choirmaster of the Cathedral's chapel. In 1690 Carlo Tessarini, violinist and composer, was born in Rimini. The city also gave birth to the musician Benedetto Neri, professor at the Academy of Music in Milan.\nAmintore Galli, illustrious musicologist and composer born in Talamello in 1845, attended the city's Classical Lyceum before moving to Milan, where he studied at the Academy of Music; in 1945 the Municipal Theatre of Rimini was dedicated to him.Between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many social events and dance parties took place at the Bathing Establishment, hosting celebrities such as soprano Elena Bianchini-Cappelli and tenor Enrico Caruso.\nIn recent years, the city inspired the homonymous music album by Fabrizio De Andr\u00e9, released in 1978, and it is cited in various popular Italian and foreign songs by Fabrizio De Andr\u00e9, Francesco Guccini, Nino Rota, Elvis Costello, Fred Buscaglione. Also born in Rimini were the songwriter Samuele Bersani and the composer and music producer Carlo Alberto Rossi, author of some of Mina's songs.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nRimini's cuisine is simple and characterized by intense flavours, and it is indissolubly related to the traditions of rural culture, with peculiar influences due to the city's position between the sea and the hills, near the edge between Romagna and Marche.\nThe traditional first course is pasta, which includes regular pasta, pasta in broth and baked pasta, prepared in many different shapes. Almost all pasta dishes require a base of \"sfoglia\", a dough of eggs and flour, handmade with a rolling pin. First courses include cappelletti, passatelli in broth, lasagne, cannelloni, nidi di rondine, ravioli, tagliatelle, garganelli, maltagliati, gnocchi and strozzapreti, seasoned with bolognese sauce or a dressing of butter and sage.\nSecond courses include meat dishes, such as pollo alla cacciatora, rabbit in porchetta, meat-filled zucchini, sausages and mixed grilled meats, and fish dishes, like barbecues of atlantic mackerels, sardines, rotisseries of oily fishes, sepias with peas, fried squids and gianchetti (known here as \"omini nudi\").Piada is a flatbread of ancient traditions, thin and crumbly, obtained from a dough of flour, water, lard and salt, and baked on a scorching \"testo\" of terracotta or cast iron. It is often accompanied by grilled meats or fishes, sausages, gratin\u00e9e vegetables, salami, prosciutto, fresh cheeses and country herbs. Cassoni, are stuffed flatbreads similar to piada, with various fillings: country herbs, potatoes and sausages, tomato and mozzarella. Side dishes include mixed salads, gratin\u00e9e vegetables, roasted potatoes, saut\u00e9e bladder campion leaves, marinated olives with dill, garlic and orange zest.\nTraditional desserts are ciambella, Carnevale's fried fiocchetti and castagnole, piada dei morti (a doughnut with walnuts, raisins, pinenuts and almonds, prepared in November), zuppa inglese (a rich dessert with custard, savoiardi and liqueurs), caramelized figs, peaches in white wine and strawberries in red wine.\nTypical local products are squacquerone (a fresh cheese) and saba, a grape syrup used to prepare desserts. Quality extra virgin olive oil is traditionally produced in Rimini area since ancient times.\nThe most famous wines include Sangiovese, Trebbiano, Pagadebit, Rebola, Cabernet Sauvignon and Albana, a dessert wine of Roman origins.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nRimini has a rich historical and artistic heritage, which includes churches and monasteries, villas and palaces, fortifications, archaeological sites, streets and squares. This richness is the result of the succession of various civilizations, dominations and historical events through 22 centuries of history: the Romans, the Byzantines, the role of medieval comune and capital of the Malatesta seignory, the Venetian Republic and the Papal States dominations.\nThe city has always been a key gate to the Orient and the southern areas of the Mediterranean, thanks to its geographical position and the importance of its harbour, and a meeting point between cultures of Northern and Central Italy.\nRimini has monuments of all epochs, with important examples of architecture from the Roman age, such as the Arch of Augustus, the Tiberius Bridge, the Amphiteatre and the Domus del Chirurgo; from the Middle Ages, such as the Palazzo dell'Arengo, the church of Sant'Agostino and Castel Sismondo; from the Renaissance, with the Tempio Malatestiano, masterpiece of Leon Battista Alberti.Rimini's archaeological heritage includes various domus of Republican and Imperial age, characterized by polychrome or black and white mosaics, necropolis and sections of the pavement of the ancient Roman streets.\nThe city, along with its boroughs and the seaside district of Marina Centro, also preserves a wide architectural heritage from the Baroque, the Neoclassical and Art Nouveau periods, with churches, palaces, hotels and mansions, which reveal its role of cultural, political, trading centre and famous seaside resort.\nThe city has a Roman structure, partly modified by following medieval transformations. A continuous evolution, through the urban renovation of the Malatesta, earthquakes, the suppressions of monasteries, has led to a peculiar stratification of historic sites and buildings. The bombings of World War II destroyed the city almost completely, compromising the monumental heritage and the integrity of the city centre, which has been reconstructed and restored in order to valorize its historic places and its numerous fine buildings.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Main sights ===\n\n\n==== Religious buildings ====\nTempio Malatestiano: The original gothic-style cathedral of San Francesco was built in the 13th century, but reconstructed into a Renaissance masterwork by the Florentine architect Leon Battista Alberti, commissioned by Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, hence the name.

The villa was built in the 17th century for want of the Diotallevi family; in 1843 it was purchased by French historian and archaeologist Adolphe No\u00ebl des Vergers and entirely renovated between 1880 and 1890 by architect Arthur-Stanislas Diet. The palace is a typical example of Napoleon III Eclectic architecture, with a main building fronted by a pronaos and flanked by two lateral wings, and internal halls characterized by Neoclassical furnitures and decorations. The villa is surrounded by a 6 hectares park, which includes a water parterre, a formal giardino all'italiana and a landscape garden, with groups of evergreen oaks, pines and cypresses which frame the palace in scenographic perspectives.\n\n\n==== Monuments ====\nArch of Augustus: This arch built in 27 BC has a single gate 9.92 metres (33 ft) high and 8.45 metres (28 ft) wide.

The bridge still connects the city centre to Borgo San Giuliano and leads to the consular roads Via Emilia and Via Popilia that lead north. Built in Istria stone, the bridge consists of five arches that rest on massive pillars with breakwater spurs set at an oblique angle with respect to the bridge's axis in order to follow the current. The bridge's structure, on the other hand, rests on a practical system of wooden poles.\nTorre dell'Orologio: The Clock tower was built in 1547 in Piazza Tre Martiri, replacing the ancient \"beccherie\" (public butcher's), and reconstructed in 1759 by Giovan Francesco Buonamici. In 1875, the top of the tower was ruined due to an earthquake, and it was restored in 1933.

        "wiki": "Rimini ( RIM-in-ee, Italian: [\u02c8ri\u02d0mini] (listen); Romagnol: R\u00e9min; Latin: Ariminum) is a city in the Emilia-Romagna region of northern Italy and capital city of the Province of Rimini. It sprawls along the Adriatic Sea, on the coast between the rivers Marecchia (the ancient Ariminus) and Ausa (ancient Aprusa). It is one of the most notable seaside resorts in Europe with revenue from both internal and international tourism forming a significant portion of the city's economy. The first bathing establishment opened in 1843. Rimini is an art city with ancient Roman and Renaissance monuments, and is also the birthplace of the famous film director Federico Fellini.\nThe city was founded by the Romans in 268 BC. Throughout Roman times, Rimini was a key communications link between the north and south of the peninsula. On its soil, Roman emperors erected monuments such as the Arch of Augustus and the Tiberius Bridge to mark the beginning and the end of the Decumanus of Rimini. During the Renaissance, the city benefited from the court of the House of Malatesta, which hosted artists like Leonardo da Vinci and produced works such as the Tempio Malatestiano. The main monuments in Rimini are the Tiberius Bridge and the Arch of Augustus.\nIn the 19th century, Rimini was one of the most active cities on the revolutionary front, hosting many of the movements seeking to achieve Italian unification. In the course of World War II, the city was the scene of numerous clashes and bombings, but also of a fierce partisan resistance that earned it the honour of a gold medal for civic valour. In recent years it has become one of the most important sites for trade fairs and conferences in Italy.\nAs of 31 May 2019, Rimini's urban area was home to 150,951 people, with approximately 325,000 living in the eponymous province, making it the twenty-eighth largest city in Italy.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient history ===\n\nThe area was part of the Etruscan civilization until the arrival of the Celts, who held it from the 6th century BC until their defeat by the Umbri in 283 BC. In 268 BC at the mouth of the Ariminus (now called the Marecchia), the Roman Republic founded the colonia of Ariminum.\nThe city was involved in the civil wars but remained faithful to the popular party and to its leaders, firstly Gaius Marius, and then Julius Caesar. After crossing the Rubicon, the latter made his legendary appeal to the legions in the Forum of Rimini.\nAriminum was seen as a bastion against invaders from Celts and also as a springboard for conquering the Padana plain. As the terminus of the Via Flaminia, which ended in the town at the surviving prestigious Arch of Augustus (erected 27 BC), Rimini was a road junction connecting central and northern Italy by the Via Aemilia that led to Piacenza and the Via Popilia that extended northwards; it also opened up trade by sea and river. Remains of the amphitheatre that could seat 12,000 people, and a five-arched bridge of Istrian stone completed by Tiberius (21 AD) are still visible. Later Galla Placidia built the church of Santo Stefano. The evidence that Rimini is of Roman origins is illustrated by the city being divided by two main streets, the Cardo and the Decumanus.\nThe end of Roman rule was marked by destruction caused by invasions and wars, but also by the establishment of the palaces of the Imperial officers and the first churches, the symbol of the spread of Christianity that held the important Council of Ariminum in the city in 359.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nWhen the Ostrogoths conquered Rimini in 493, Odoacer, besieged in Ravenna, had to capitulate. During the Gothic War (535\u2013554), Rimini was taken and retaken many times. In its vicinity the Byzantine general Narses overthrew (553) the Alamanni. Under the Byzantine rule, it belonged to the Pentapolis, part of the Exarchate of Ravenna.\nIn 728, it was taken with many other cities by Liutprand, King of the Lombards but returned to the Byzantines about 735. Pepin the Short gave it to the Holy See, but during the wars of the popes and the Italian cities against the emperors, Rimini sided with the latter.\nIn the 13th century, it suffered from the discords of the Gambacari and Ansidei families. The city became a municipality in the 14th century, and with the arrival of the religious orders, numerous convents and churches were built, providing work for many illustrious artists. In fact, Giotto inspired the 14th-century School of Rimini, which was the expression of original cultural ferment.\nThe House of Malatesta emerged from the struggles between municipal factions with Malatesta da Verucchio, who in 1239 was named podest\u00e0 (chief magistrate) of the city. Despite interruptions, his family held authority until 1528. In 1312 he was succeeded by Malatestino Malatesta, first signore (lord) of the city and Pandolfo I Malatesta, the latter's brother, named by Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, as imperial vicar of Romagna. Ferrantino, son of Malatesta II (1335), was opposed by his cousin Ramberto and by Cardinal Bertrand du Pouget (1331), legate of Pope John XXII. Malatesta II was also lord of Pesaro. He was succeeded by Malatesta Ungaro (1373) and Galeotto I Malatesta, uncle of the former (1385), lord also of Fano (from 1340), Pesaro, and Cesena (1378).\nHis son Carlo I Malatesta, one of the most respected condottieri of the time, enlarged the Riminese possessions and restored the port. Carlo died childless in 1429, and the lordship was divided into three parts, Rimini going to Galeotto Roberto Malatesta, a Catholic zealot who turned out to be totally inadequate for the role. The Pesarese line of the Malatestas tried, in fact, to take advantage of his weakness and to capture the city, but Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, Carlo's nephew, who was only 14 at the time, intervened to save it. Galeotto retired to a convent, and Sigismondo obtained the rule of Rimini.\nSigismondo Pandolfo was the most famous lord of Rimini. In 1433, Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, sojourned in the city and for a while he was the commander-in-chief of the Papal armies. A skilled general, Sigismondo often acted as condottiero for other states to gain money to embellish it (he was also a dilettante poet). He had the famous Tempio Malatestiano rebuilt by Leon Battista Alberti. However, after the rise of Pope Pius II, he had to fight constantly for the independence of the city. In 1463 he was forced to submit to Pius II, who left him only Rimini and little more; Roberto Malatesta, his son (1482), under Pope Paul II, nearly lost his state, but under Pope Sixtus IV, became the commanding officer of the pontifical army against Ferdinand of Naples. Sigismondo was, however, defeated by Neapolitan forces in the battle of Campomorto (1482). Pandolfo IV, his son (1500), lost Rimini to Cesare Borgia, after whose overthrow it fell to Venice (1503\u20131509), but it was later retaken by Pope Julius II and incorporated into the Papal States. After the death of Pope Leo X, Pandolfo returned for several months, and with his son Sigismondo Malatesta held a rule which looked tyrannous even for the time. Pope Adrian VI expelled him again and gave Rimini to the Duke of Urbino, the pope's vicar in Romagna. In 1527 Sigismondo managed to regain the city, but in the following year the Malatesta dominion died forever.\n\n\n=== Renaissance and Enlightment ===\n\nAt the beginning of the 16th century, Rimini, now a secondary town of the Papal States, was ruled by an Apostolic Legate. Towards the end of the 16th century, the municipal square (now Piazza Cavour), which had been closed off on a site where the Poletti Theatre was subsequently built, was redesigned. The statue of Pope Paul V has stood in the centre of the square next to the fountain since 1614.\nIn the 16th century, the 'grand square' (now the Piazza Tre Martiri in honor of three civilians hanged by the retreating Nazis at the end of World War II), which was where markets and tournaments were held, underwent various changes. A small temple dedicated to Saint Anthony of Padua and a clock tower were built there, giving the square its present shape and size.\nUntil the 18th century raiding armies, earthquakes, famines, floods and pirate attacks ravaged the city. In this gloomy situation and due to a weakened local economy, fishing took on great importance, a fact testified by the construction of structures such as the fish market and the lighthouse.\nIn 1797, Rimini, along with the rest of Romagna, was affected by the passage of the Napoleonic army and became part of the Cisalpine Republic. Napoleonic policy suppressed the monastic orders, confiscating their property and thus dispersing a substantial heritage, and demolished many churches including the ancient cathedral of Santa Colomba.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nOn 30 March 1815, Joachim Murat launched his Rimini Proclamation to the Italian people from here, hoping to incite them to unity and independence. In 1845, a band of adventurers commanded by Ribbotti entered the city and proclaimed a constitution which was soon abolished. In 1860, Rimini and Romagna were incorporated into the Kingdom of Italy.\nThe city was transformed after the 1843 founding of the first bathing establishment and the Kursaal, a building constructed to host sumptuous social events, became the symbol of Rimini's status as a tourist resort. In just a few years, the seafront underwent considerable development work making Rimini 'the city of small villas'. At the beginning of the 20th century, The Grand Hotel, the city's first major accommodation facility, was built near the beach.\nDuring the first World War, Rimini and its surrounding infrastructure was one of the primary targets of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. After Italy's declaration of war on 15 May 1915, the Austro-Hungarian fleet left its harbours the same day and started its assault on the Adriatic coast between Venice and Barletta.\nDuring World War II, the city was torn apart by heavy bombardments and by the passage of the front over the Gothic Line during the Battle of Rimini and was eventually captured by Greek and Canadian forces. Following its liberation on September 21, 1944, reconstruction work began, culminating in huge development of the tourist industry in the city.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nRimini is situated at 44\u00b003\u203200\u2033 north and 12\u00b034\u203200\u2033 east, along the coast of the Adriatic sea, at the southeastern edge of Emilia-Romagna, at a short distance from Montefeltro and Marche. Rimini extends for 135.71 square km and borders the municipalities of Bellaria-Igea Marina, San Mauro Pascoli, and Santarcangelo di Romagna towards NW, Verucchio and Serravalle towards SW, Coriano towards S, and Riccione towards SE. The city is also located at the intersection of three Roman roads: Via Emilia, Via Popilia, and Via Flaminia. Viserba is the most important of Rimini's northern districts, with 8,556 inhabitants.\nRimini is located in a historically strategic position, at the extreme southern edge of the Po Valley, at the junction point of Northern and Central Italy.\nIt is surrounded towards southwest by the gently rolling hills of Covignano (153 metres high), Vergiano (81 m), San Martino Monte l'Abbate (57 m) and San Lorenzo in Correggiano (60 m), widely cultivated, with vineyards, olive groves and orchards, and dominated by ancient mansions. These hills, mostly made of clay and sand, connect the plains, created by the Marecchia and Ausa, the two most important rivers of Rimini territory, to the higher hills of the Apennines.\nThe Marecchia river runs through its valley and the plain in a very large riverbed and, after confluence with the Ausa, it flows into the Adriatic sea through a deviator between San Giuliano Mare and Rivabella, while the ancient riverbed is used in its last section as the city's harbour.\nThe Marecchia, usually with little water flow, was subjected to periodic, destructive floods near its mouth, where the riverbed became narrow after various bends: for this reason it was deviated north.  Ausa creek, which was the eastern limit of Rimini for many centuries, was deviated as well after World War II, and its original riverbed was filled and turned into an urban park.\nThe coastal strip, made of recent marine deposits, is edged by a fine sandy beach, 15 km long and up to 200 metres wide, interrupted only by the mouth of the rivers and gently shelving towards the sea. Along the coastline there is a low sandy cliff, created by sea rise around 4000 B.C., partly conserved north of Rimini, between Rivabella and Bellaria-Igea Marina, at a distance of about 1,300 metres from the coast.Rimini's territory, for its geographical position and its climatic features, is situated on the edge between the mediterranean and the central European phytoclimatic zones, and thus it represents an environment of notable naturalistic value.\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nRimini is the main centre of a 50 kilometres (31 miles) long coastal conurbation, which extends from Cervia to Gabicce Mare, including the seaside resorts of Cesenatico, Gatteo a Mare, Bellaria-Igea Marina, Riccione, Misano Adriatico and Cattolica. The conurbation has about 300,000 inhabitants and originated around the mid-20th century due to urban sprawl following intensive tourism development.\nThe city of Rimini includes the seaside localities and districts of Torre Pedrera, Viserbella, Viserba, Rivabella, San Giuliano Mare towards north and Bellariva, Marebello, Rivazzurra, Miramare towards south. These districts are important to tourism in Rimini.\nThe city proper includes the historic centre, the four ancient boroughs of S. Giuliano, S. Giovanni, S. Andrea and Marina, the seaside district of Marina Centro and various modern districts\u2014Celle, Marecchiese, INA Casa, V PEEP, Colonnella, Lagomaggio\u2014and outer suburbs such as Padulli, Spadarolo, Covignano, Grottarossa and Villaggio 1\u00b0 Maggio, located outside of the Adriatic Highway beltline. More outer suburbs are S. Giustina, S. Vito, Spadarolo, Vergiano, Corpol\u00f2 and Gaiofana.\nThe historic centre of Rimini, surrounded by the city walls built by Malatesta, and formerly bounded by the Marecchia and Ausa rivers, has a distinctive, regular urban structure of Roman origins. It was divided since the Middle Ages in four districts (Rioni): Cittadella, Clodio, Pomposo and Montecavallo. The boundaries of these districts are not known, but it is assumed that they followed the current Corso d'Augusto, Via Garibaldi, and Via Gambalunga. Additionally, the ancient coastline was situated much farther inland than today's; it gradually shifted outward over centuries and the new land was developed throughout the 20th century.Rione Cittadella, in the western area of the centre, was the most important district of the city and included the Municipal palaces, Castel Sismondo and the Cathedral of Santa Colomba. Rione Clodio, towards the north, was popular and a peculiar urban structure tied with the near Marecchia river. Rione Pomposo, the widest district of the city, included large orchards and convents. Rione Montecavallo, on the southern part of the historical centre, is characterized by bowed, irregular streets of medieval origins, by the Fossa Patara creek and a small hill called \"Montirone\".Outside of the city walls, there are four boroughs (Borghi), which were entirely incorporated to the city by the urban sprawl in early 20th century.Borgo S. Giuliano, along Via Emilia, dates back to the 11th century and was originally a fishermen's settlement. Dominated by the Church of San Giuliano, it is one of the most picturesque spots of the city, with narrow streets and squares, colourful small houses and many frescoes representing characters and places of Federico Fellini's films.\nBorgo S. Giovanni, on both sides of Via Flaminia, was populated by artisans and middle-class; Borgo S. Andrea, located outside of Porta Montanara, along Via Covignano, Via Montefeltro and Via Monte Titano, was strictly tied with agriculture and commerce of cows. Both these two boroughs were developed in 15th century; then they burned in a fire in 1469 and were rebuilt in 19th century, relocating small industries and manufactures, including a brick factory and a phosphorus matches factory.\nBorgo Marina, situated on the right bank of the Marecchia, was a portual borough, heavily transformed by Fascist demolitions and World War II bombings, which hit this area due to the proximity to the bridges of the city and the railway station.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nRimini has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa) moderated by the influence of the Adriatic sea, featuring the highest autumn and winter mean temperatures and the highest annual low temperatures in Emilia-Romagna.Precipitations are equally distributed during the year, with a peak in October (75 mm) and two slight minimums, in January (42 mm) and July (43 mm). In spring, autumn and winter precipitations mainly come from oceanic fronts, while in summer they are brought by thunderstorms, coming from the Apennines or the Po Valley.\nHumidity is high all year round, with a minimum of 72% in June and July and a maximum of 84% in November and December. Prevailing winds blow from W, S, E and NE. Southwesterly winds, known as libeccio or garbino, are foehn winds, which may bring warm temperatures in each season. On average, there are over 2,040 sunshine hours per year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nAs of 2019, Rimini has 150,951 inhabitants, with a density of about 1,100 inhabitants per square kilometre within the city limits.\nIn 1861, by the time of the first Italian census, the population was around 28,000; in 1931 it was more than double, 57,000.\nWith the increasing tourism development, population rapidly grew between 1951 and 1981, the fastest growing period for Rimini in the 20th century, when the city's population grew from 77,000 to over 128,000.During the 20th century, two former districts of Rimini got administrative autonomy, causing two distinct temporary drops in population totals: Riccione in 1922 and Bellaria-Igea Marina in 1956.\nForeign population is 18,396, (12.5% of the total), mainly from Eastern Europe, East Asia and North Africa. Between 1992 and 2014, foreign population grew from around 1,800 to over 18,000 units. \nThe most important foreign communities are Albanians (3,479), Romanians (2,904), Ukrainians (2,409), Chinese (1,197) and Moldovans (1,023). Other notable foreign groups in the city are Senegalese, Moroccans, Macedonians, Tunisians, Russians, Bangladeshis and Peruvians.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nRimini's population is mostly Catholic. The city is the seat of the Diocese of Rimini, a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Ravenna-Cervia.\nThe first cathedral of the diocese was the former Cathedral of Santa Colomba until 1798, when the title was transferred to the church of Sant'Agostino. Since 1809, Rimini's cathedral is the Tempio Malatestiano.\nBesides Roman Catholic churches, there are also Orthodox, Evangelical and Adventist churches. Between the 13th and 14th century, Rimini had a flourishing Jewish community, which built three distinct synagogues, all destroyed, formerly located around the area of Piazza Cavour, Via Cairoli and Santa Colomba.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nRimini is a major international tourist destination and seaside resort, among the most famous ones in Europe and the Mediterranean basin, thanks to a long sandy beach, well-equipped bathing establishments, theme parks and a number of opportunities for leisure and spare time. The economy of the city is entirely based on tourism, whose development started in the first half of the 19th century and increased after World War II.\nRimini's origins as a seaside resort date back to 1843, when the first \"Bathing Establishment\" was founded, the oldest one of the Adriatic Sea. The width of the beach, the gentle gradient of the sea bed, the equipment of bathing establishments, the luxurious hotels, the mildness of the climate, the richness of curative waters, the prestigious social events, made Rimini a renowned tourist destination among the Italian and European aristocracy.\n\nTourism in Rimini started as therapeutic stay (thalassotherapy, hydrotherapy and heliotherapy), evolving into elite vacation in the late 19th century, into middle-class tourism during the fascist era and finally into mass tourism in the postwar period.On summer nights, there is a festival called \"La Notte Rosa\".\nRimini concentrates a quarter of Emilia-Romagna's hotels, with over 1,000 hotels, 300 of which are open all year round, and hundreds of apartment hotels, apartments, holiday homes, bed & breakfast and campings. Tourism is mainly based on seaside holidays, but also includes trade fairs and conventions, events, nightlife, culture, wellness, food and wine.\nRimini is a leading trade fair and convention site in Italy, with an important trade fair (Rimini Fiera) and a convention centre (Palacongressi di Rimini).\nThe city's other economic sectors, such as services, commerce, construction industry, have been influenced by the development of tourism. Commerce is one of the main economic sectors, thanks to the presence of a large wholesale center, two hypermarkets, department stores, supermarkets and hundreds of shops and boutiques. Industry, less developed than tourism and services, includes various companies active in food industry, woodworking machineries, building constructions, furnishing, clothing and publishing. Notable companies are Bimota (motorcycles), SCM (woodworking machines), Trevi S.p.A. (electronic goods). Rimini is also seat of a historic railway works plant.Agriculture and fishing were the city's main economic sources until the early 20th century. Rimini boasts an important tradition in wine production (Sangiovese, Trebbiano, Rebola, Pagadebit, Albana wines) and an historic extra virgin olive oil production. The most common crops of the area, besides vineyards and olive groves, are orchards (peaches, nectarines, apricots, persimmons, apples, pears, cherries, kiwifruits and plums), vegetables and legumes (lettuce, zucchini, potatoes, tomatoes, beans, green beans, cauliflowers, fennels, strawberries), seminatives (wheat, barley, grain sorghum, corn, oat), sunflowers and canola. The fishing industry can count on a fleet of about 100 fishing boats, the most consistent of Rimini's fishing department, which includes the coast between Cattolica and Cesenatico.\n\n\n== Arts and culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe City Museum (Museo della Citt\u00e0), main museal institution of Rimini, was inaugurated as \"Archaeology Gallery\", at the ground floor of Palazzo Gambalunga in 1872, thanks to Riminese historian Luigi Tonini, active in researching and studying the local archaeological heritage. The Archaeology Gallery was the first museum of the city and was conceived as a collection of Etruscan civilization and Roman antiquities, found in Rimini and in the surrounding countryside.\nThe civic museum was arranged in San Francesco monastery in 1923 and in 1938 was enlarged with a section of Medieval Art. The objects avoided the destructions of World War II, being moved between 1940 and 1943 to two different shelters in Spadarolo and Novafeltria. In 1964, the collections were moved to Palazzo Visconti and finally, from 1990, to the Collegio dei Gesuiti, a large Jesuit convent designed by bolognese architect Alfonso Torreggiani, built in 1749.\n\nIn the Archaeological department are exhibited grave goods from Villanovian tombs of Verucchio and Covignano, architectural pieces, sculptures, mosaics, ceramics, coins of Republican and Imperial eras, and the exceptional medical kit from the Domus del Chirurgo. The collection of the Roman Lapidary, exhibited in the inner courtyard of the convent, has funerary monuments, epigraphies and milestones.\nThe Medieval and Modern Art departments include collections of paintings, sculptures and art objects by artists from Romagna (Giovanni da Rimini, Giuliano da Rimini, Guido Cagnacci), Emilia (Guercino, Vittorio Maria Bigari), Tuscany (Domenico Ghirlandaio, Agostino di Duccio) and Veneto (Giovanni Bellini), from 14th to 19th century. The City Museum arranges temporary exhibitions and promotes researches, study and restoration activities of the city's historical and artistic heritage.\nThe Fellini Museum (Museo Fellini), dedicated to Federico Fellini, houses temporary exhibitions of documents, drawings, scenographies and costumes related to the movie production of the famous film director.The Museum of Glances (Museo degli Sguardi), housed in Villa Alvarado, on Covignano hill, was instituted in 2005 acquiring the objects of the former Museum of Extra European Cultures \"Dinz Rialto\", founded in Rimini in 1972 by explorer Delfino Dinz Rialto, the art pieces of the former Missionary Museum of the Grazie and other private collections. The museum has over 3,000 objects coming from China, Oceania, Africa and pre-Columbian America, with paintings, sculptures, everyday objects, totems, masks, musical instruments and clothes illustrating how the Western world has looked at these territories' cultures through history.\nThe Museum of Small Fishing and Marine (Museo della Piccola Pesca e della Marineria), in Viserbella, shows the history of Rimini's Marine through a collection of boats, fishing tools, photographs and a large seashells collection, with pieces from all over the Mediterranean Sea.In the municipality of Rimini there are also two private museums: the Aviation Museum (Museo dell'Aviazione) in Sant'Aquilina, close to the boundary of the Republic of San Marino, and the National Museum of Motorcycle (Museo Nazionale del Motociclo) in Casalecchio.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nThe Gambalunghiana Library, historic institution founded in 1617 by jurist Alessandro Gambalunga, plays a leading role in the city's cultural life. The library has over 280,000 books, including 60,000 ancient books, 1,350 manuscripts, 6,000 prints and 80,000 photographs. Among the incunables, dated back from the 15th century, stand out De Claris mulieribus (1497) by Giacomo Filippo Foresti and De re militari by Roberto Valturio. The collection of illuminated manuscripts, coming from different cultural and linguistic European boundaries, includes the Regalis Historia by Frate Leonardo and De Civitate Dei by Saint Augustine.\n\n\n=== Theatre and Films ===\n\nThe first stable theatre in Rimini is documented since 1681, when the city council decided on the transformation of the Arengo's main hall into a large theatre hall, hosting shows of amateur dramatics companies and the young Carlo Goldoni, who was studying philosophy in the city at that time.\nBetween 1842 and 1857 the great Municipal Theatre Vittorio Emanuele II was built, designed in Neoclassical style by the architect Luigi Poletti, according to the traditional canons of the 19th-century Italian theatre. The theatre was inaugurated by Giuseppe Verdi, who directed \"L'Aroldo\", and hosted prestigious opera seasons until its destruction in 1943 due to aerial bombings. Since 1947, it has been called Amintore Galli Theatre. Since its closure, theatre shows has been hosted in the modern Teatro Ermete Novelli in Marina Centro.\nRimini appeared on the movie screen for the first time in some early footages, such as the documentary \"Rimini l'Ostenda d'Italia\" (1912), and in various Istituto Luce's newsreels in the Thirties. The film director Federico Fellini, was born and raised in Rimini, portrayed characters, places and atmospheres of his hometown through his movies, which however were almost entirely shot in Cinecitt\u00e0's studios in Rome: I Vitelloni, 8 e \u00bd (Oscar award in 1964), I clowns, Amarcord (Oscar award in 1975). Other Italian movies filmed in Rimini includes \"La prima notte di quiete\" by Valerio Zurlini, \"Rimini Rimini\" by Sergio Corbucci, \"Abbronzatissimi\" by Bruno Gaburro, \"Sole negli occhi\" by Andrea Porporati, \"Da zero a dieci\" by Luciano Ligabue and \"Non pensarci\" by Gianni Zanasi.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe earliest musician from Rimini was Saint Arduino (10th century); a musical tradition of some distinction was witnessed in the following century by the presence of a music school, named \"Scuola cantorum\", at the Cathedral of Santa Colomba. French composer Guillaume Dufay stayed in Rimini, at Malatesta's court until 1427. In 1518 Pietro Aaron became the first choirmaster of the Cathedral's chapel. In 1690 Carlo Tessarini, violinist and composer, was born in Rimini. The city also gave birth to the musician Benedetto Neri, professor at the Academy of Music in Milan.\nAmintore Galli, illustrious musicologist and composer born in Talamello in 1845, attended the city's Classical Lyceum before moving to Milan, where he studied at the Academy of Music; in 1945 the Municipal Theatre of Rimini was dedicated to him.Between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many social events and dance parties took place at the Bathing Establishment, hosting celebrities such as soprano Elena Bianchini-Cappelli and tenor Enrico Caruso.\nIn recent years, the city inspired the homonymous music album by Fabrizio De Andr\u00e9, released in 1978, and it is cited in various popular Italian and foreign songs by Fabrizio De Andr\u00e9, Francesco Guccini, Nino Rota, Elvis Costello, Fred Buscaglione. Also born in Rimini were the songwriter Samuele Bersani and the composer and music producer Carlo Alberto Rossi, author of some of Mina's songs.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nRimini's cuisine is simple and characterized by intense flavours, and it is indissolubly related to the traditions of rural culture, with peculiar influences due to the city's position between the sea and the hills, near the edge between Romagna and Marche.\nThe traditional first course is pasta, which includes regular pasta, pasta in broth and baked pasta, prepared in many different shapes. Almost all pasta dishes require a base of \"sfoglia\", a dough of eggs and flour, handmade with a rolling pin. First courses include cappelletti, passatelli in broth, lasagne, cannelloni, nidi di rondine, ravioli, tagliatelle, garganelli, maltagliati, gnocchi and strozzapreti, seasoned with bolognese sauce or a dressing of butter and sage.\nSecond courses include meat dishes, such as pollo alla cacciatora, rabbit in porchetta, meat-filled zucchini, sausages and mixed grilled meats, and fish dishes, like barbecues of atlantic mackerels, sardines, rotisseries of oily fishes, sepias with peas, fried squids and gianchetti (known here as \"omini nudi\").Piada is a flatbread of ancient traditions, thin and crumbly, obtained from a dough of flour, water, lard and salt, and baked on a scorching \"testo\" of terracotta or cast iron. It is often accompanied by grilled meats or fishes, sausages, gratin\u00e9e vegetables, salami, prosciutto, fresh cheeses and country herbs. Cassoni, are stuffed flatbreads similar to piada, with various fillings: country herbs, potatoes and sausages, tomato and mozzarella. Side dishes include mixed salads, gratin\u00e9e vegetables, roasted potatoes, saut\u00e9e bladder campion leaves, marinated olives with dill, garlic and orange zest.\nTraditional desserts are ciambella, Carnevale's fried fiocchetti and castagnole, piada dei morti (a doughnut with walnuts, raisins, pinenuts and almonds, prepared in November), zuppa inglese (a rich dessert with custard, savoiardi and liqueurs), caramelized figs, peaches in white wine and strawberries in red wine.\nTypical local products are squacquerone (a fresh cheese) and saba, a grape syrup used to prepare desserts. Quality extra virgin olive oil is traditionally produced in Rimini area since ancient times.\nThe most famous wines include Sangiovese, Trebbiano, Pagadebit, Rebola, Cabernet Sauvignon and Albana, a dessert wine of Roman origins.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nRimini has a rich historical and artistic heritage, which includes churches and monasteries, villas and palaces, fortifications, archaeological sites, streets and squares. This richness is the result of the succession of various civilizations, dominations and historical events through 22 centuries of history: the Romans, the Byzantines, the role of medieval comune and capital of the Malatesta seignory, the Venetian Republic and the Papal States dominations.\nThe city has always been a key gate to the Orient and the southern areas of the Mediterranean, thanks to its geographical position and the importance of its harbour, and a meeting point between cultures of Northern and Central Italy.\nRimini has monuments of all epochs, with important examples of architecture from the Roman age, such as the Arch of Augustus, the Tiberius Bridge, the Amphiteatre and the Domus del Chirurgo; from the Middle Ages, such as the Palazzo dell'Arengo, the church of Sant'Agostino and Castel Sismondo; from the Renaissance, with the Tempio Malatestiano, masterpiece of Leon Battista Alberti.Rimini's archaeological heritage includes various domus of Republican and Imperial age, characterized by polychrome or black and white mosaics, necropolis and sections of the pavement of the ancient Roman streets.\nThe city, along with its boroughs and the seaside district of Marina Centro, also preserves a wide architectural heritage from the Baroque, the Neoclassical and Art Nouveau periods, with churches, palaces, hotels and mansions, which reveal its role of cultural, political, trading centre and famous seaside resort.\nThe city has a Roman structure, partly modified by following medieval transformations. A continuous evolution, through the urban renovation of the Malatesta, earthquakes, the suppressions of monasteries, has led to a peculiar stratification of historic sites and buildings. The bombings of World War II destroyed the city almost completely, compromising the monumental heritage and the integrity of the city centre, which has been reconstructed and restored in order to valorize its historic places and its numerous fine buildings.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Main sights ===\n\n\n==== Religious buildings ====\nTempio Malatestiano: The original gothic-style cathedral of San Francesco was built in the 13th century, but reconstructed into a Renaissance masterwork by the Florentine architect Leon Battista Alberti, commissioned by Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, hence the name.

The villa was built in the 17th century for want of the Diotallevi family; in 1843 it was purchased by French historian and archaeologist Adolphe No\u00ebl des Vergers and entirely renovated between 1880 and 1890 by architect Arthur-Stanislas Diet. The palace is a typical example of Napoleon III Eclectic architecture, with a main building fronted by a pronaos and flanked by two lateral wings, and internal halls characterized by Neoclassical furnitures and decorations.

Built in Istria stone, the bridge consists of five arches that rest on massive pillars with breakwater spurs set at an oblique angle with respect to the bridge's axis in order to follow the current. The bridge's structure, on the other hand, rests on a practical system of wooden poles.\nTorre dell'Orologio: The Clock tower was built in 1547 in Piazza Tre Martiri, replacing the ancient \"beccherie\" (public butcher's), and reconstructed in 1759 by Giovan Francesco Buonamici. In 1875, the top of the tower was ruined due to an earthquake, and it was restored in 1933.

          "Another incredible piece of ancient history when not relaxing on the beach. By all means worth seeing!!",
          "That this is still standing is amazing. There isn't too much to see but I'm glad I did to imagine the Romans entering into the (old) fortified town was worth it. The arch comes at the end of a path that runs under the railway line connecting you to the beach.",
          "a very great historic part of the old city.we took a lot of photos here and the authenticity of this part of the town is amazing.",

          "One of the best things you can see in Rimini. Arco d'Augosto it s a very well preserved piece of art. The details of this piece are still, even after so many years, easy to see. Arco d'Augusto it's a very good place for taking photos.",
          "Second marvel in historical Rimini. Watch it under daylight but also at night as it looks even more impressive.",
          "This is a wonderfully preserved example of Roman architecture in Rimini. It's easy to access in a town which is ideally suited for strolling around.",
          "We came to theis plae straight from railway station. From the station you go to the left, pass Amphitheater, go to the right through Parco Alcide Cevi. At the end of the park cross the street and you will see The Arc. It is dediated to the Emperor Augustus.",
          "The arc is massive and at first you think it's just an arc however on reflection you realise this is architectural genius in the Roman era. The arc was too big for gates but is a nice photo opportunity in the heart of the city",

          "I really liked it. Finding history all over Italy is not rare. I liked the way he was re-building it so he could be renamed for it. I don't like that he didn't finished the work.",
          "this roman arch is very old and still in use with cars and people going throu it,its worth a visit while walking and sight seeing the old town,",

          "A great example of Roman architecture. Worth dragging yourself away from the beach for the day / morning / afternoon. Pay a visit to Cafe Romana too.",
          "The Arco d'Augusto is a great way to admire Roman architecture. It is the oldest Roman arch, dating back to 27 BC. Other than passing thru the arc and admiring it, there's not much to do. But it a nice way to go in the old city of Rimini.",
          "See my review of Tiberius Bridge, lovely walk through old Rimini town, passing by Piazzas and lots of back streets, nice counterbalance to the Rimini beachfront strip.",
          "The Arch is at the other end of Rimini from the Roman Bridge and is an important historical landmark. Constructed from a softer stone than the bridge, it is quite badly eroded. although the main features are still evident. Nice to sit and watch everyday life passing by - it is",
          "The Arch of Augustus at Rimini was dedicated to the Emperor Augustus by the Roman Senate in 27 BC and is the oldest Roman arch which survives. The gate's principal function, aside from functioning as a city gate, was to support the lavish bronze statue of Augustus. The",
          "I pass by here often and I look at it and it think it's nice such an old monument that it's still well preserved , it's also the main attraction of rimini downtown I would suggest to check it",
          "An Imposing Roman arch is set off in a traffic oval and serves as an entry point to the old town. Remains of the old town wall extend from the arch along side a lovely park that serves as a boundary to part of the old town and a traffic free zone for cyclists and walkers.",

          "I liked this place! It was a start of our observing of an old city of Rimini. There is a great bicycle road around this memorial.",
          "This is an interesting monument, but I don't think rimini sells it as such. The area is run down. There are no coffee bars or anywhere to get anything to eat. Which is a shame",
          "The arch is a short walk from the town center. If you go to see it, plan on spending a few minutes there and taking some nice photos.",
          "Well, um, clearly a lot of history attached to it, but visually it's a bit dull. It's an arch. Nothing much around it to contextualise it. Looks like it's lost its way and landed there by accident. If you're in the square in the middle of the Old Town you'll see it, but don't",
          "A must see place in the heart of Rimini. Very good location - if you go for a walk in the historic centre you can't miss it.",
          "I have seen plenty of ruins. This is in good shape, but it is still an arch. If you have never seen one before you may be very impressed. What is impressive is that it withstood wars and time.",
          "It is considered to be one of the most visited ancient arches in Rimini and Italy. It is like a symbol of Caesar Oktavian Epoch.",

          "Yes thisl one still stays here, where it was first built. You can feel the aura of the many people from the old times went through it.",
          "Beautiful part of the old town rich in history. There is a pleasant walk in the surroundings and It is worth of seeing.",
          "The beautiful Arco di Augusto stands at the south eastern end of Via Corso di Augusto (a busy shopping street). This is the oldest surviving Roman arch in the world. It was erected in 27 BC to honour Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus at the intersection of two main roads of the Roman",
          "Nice and relaxing area with a lot of green, at the end of the main shopping street.",
          "Is the oldest Roman Arch ( 27 B.C. ) and , up to me , the most beautiful. Many people think that there was a door under the Arch. No way !!!!! Emperor Augustus politics was keen to peace, Pax Augustea, and is opinion was that you don't need to protect what doesn't have to be",
          "Enjoy some history. This is a beautiful arch that was part of the city wall."

        "wiki": "The Misano World Circuit (officially known as Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli, and before 2006 called Circuito Internazionale Santa Monica), also known as Marco Simoncelli Circuit is a race track located next to the town of Misano Adriatico (Province of Rimini) in the frazione of Santa Monica-Cella. Originally designed in 1969 as a length of 3.488 kilometres (2.17 mi), it hosted its first event in 1972. In 1993, the track length was increased to 4.064 kilometres (2.53 mi).\nAs of 2007, it began hosting the San Marino and Rimini Coast Grand Prix as part of the MotoGP World Championship.\nIn 2012, the track was renamed to commemorate Marco Simoncelli, a local motorcycle racer who died in 2011.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe circuit was designed in 1969; it was built from 1970 and 1972, and inaugurated that year. Its initial length was 3.488 km (2.167 miles) and only had a small, open pit area. This version of the circuit hosted three editions of the San Marino motorcycle Grand Prix, from the 1985 season to the 1987 season. In 1993 it was modified for the first time: the track length was increased to 4.060 km (2.523 miles), with the possibility to race both the long and the old short loop; moreover, new facilities and new pit garages were built.  It was at Misano during the 1993 Italian Grand Prix that the defending 500 cc World Champion Wayne Rainey's career ended after he fell and suffered a broken spine. Between 1996 and 2001 all facilities were improved further, adding more pits and stands. In 2005, a new access point to the circuit was built, Via Daijiro Kato, in honor of the late Japanese rider, killed during the 2003 Japanese Grand Prix, whose in-season race home was in the Portoverde frazione of Misano Adriatico.\nIn order to host again the World motorcycle championship, the circuit was extensively modified in 2006. The circuit direction was changed to clockwise direction, the track length was brought to 4.180 km (2.597 miles), track width has been widened to 14 m (46 ft), facilities were improved, and all security measures have been applied. The first MotoGP race held on the circuit after the modifications was the 2007 San Marino and Rimini Coast Grand Prix, which was won by \"home\" marque Ducati.\n\nDuring the 2010 Moto2 event, Japanese rider Shoya Tomizawa was killed after losing control of his bike and being subsequently struck by both Scott Redding and Alex de Angelis. Coincidentally this incident occurred 17 years to the day of Wayne Rainey's career ending incident also at Misano.\nOn 3 November 2011, the circuit owners announced that it would be named after Marco Simoncelli, an Italian motorcycle racer who died during the Shell Advance Malaysian Grand Prix in Sepang a week prior. Simoncelli was born in nearby Cattolica and had lived from childhood in Coriano. On 8 June 2012 the track's new name was confirmed at the San Marino round of the Superbike World Championship. Also, Scuderia Toro Rosso, later known as Scuderia AlphaTauri, make first shakedowns at this track. Most recently, the Scuderia AlphaTauri AT01, AlphaTauri's 2020 challenger and the first car to be run under the name 'AlphaTauri', had its first shakedown here 24 hours after it was first revealed, by Daniil Kvyat and Pierre Gasly.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Homepage in English",

          "Went to the 2013 round of MotoGP at MWC Marco Simoncelli and had a great time. The circuit is well placed just a few KM from the coastal town of Misano, and we had no problems driving to & from Rimini each day. We parked about 500m from the circuit in a field for free. The",
          "Had a good time in grandstand D in terms of atmosphere/weather/racing at MotoGP but certainly a very primitive track in terms of facilities. Can't walk around track which is a real downer and the queue to get a portion of chips(or any food) was utter madness :-) I could",
          "We purchased our tickets for the GP before we left England and had to pick them up from a place not too far from the train station. they provided a land train to get to the circuit. The circuit itself is great!! We sat in Prato 2 for race day. Good views of the racing and they",
          "GOOD: near of Misano adriatico, it's possible to walk from the hotel to the circuit. NOT GOOD: impossible to change the point of view, I was in the Grandstand D, impossible to walk around the circuit, watch something else with an other point of view.",
          "The sound and speed of the track is immense and I would definitely recommend it for that. I do think though that the ticket prices are too high and the cost of food and drink inside the circuit is disgusting!! I would defintely risk trying to get your own food and drink in and",
          "The two large grass mounds give a great view of most of the circuit and are the least expensive to enter at E70 or E90. Take plenty of drinks as there is no shade in these areas. Went for MotoGP on 15th September 2013 and enjoyed 3 races from amongst the local supporters who",
          "We attended Misano for the MotoGP weekend of 14-15 September 2013. The track is superb and only a short walk from the local town of Misano Adriatico. It is also only a 20minute drive to Rossi's home town of Tavullia. The only caution i would offer is that the ticket you buy is",
          "Excellent weekend, excellent races. Visited Misano Circuit for FIA European Truck Racing Championship. It is very interesting, truck is very accessible and not hard to find. Great atmosphere. Different than any other race I have seen until now.",

          "Great atmosphere! Great to be there if there is a MotoGP race. Real Italian surroundings. A must do as a race fan",
          "Misano is a great circuit for spectators, we have visited for both World Superbike & Moto GP. For WSB we sat in Tribuna A or B which was great with plenty of room and free paddock entry on Friday. Our most recent trip was to Moto GP and would recommend a ticket for Prato 1 or 2",
          "If you're a member of the Rossi fan club or if you follow MotoGP in general, give Misano a try, you can walk to the track which is always a bonus",
          "We went to Misano and found ourselves having to walk for ages in the heat along a dirt track to be locked in a concrete grandstand that had been oversold to the locals it seemed without seat allocations, no shade, 1 food outlet, 1 drink outlet, 1 toilet block and you're not",

        "wiki": "San Marino ( (listen), Italian: [sam ma\u02c8ri\u02d0no]), officially the Republic of San Marino (Italian: Repubblica di San Marino; Romagnol: Rip\u00f3bblica d' San Marein), also known as the Most Serene Republic of San Marino (Italian: Serenissima Repubblica di San Marino), is a microstate in Southern Europe completely enclosed by Italy.Located on the northeastern side of the Apennine Mountains, San Marino covers a land area of just over 61 km2 (24 sq mi), and has a population of 33,562. Its capital is the City of San Marino and its largest settlement is Dogana. San Marino's official language is Italian.\nThe country derives its name from Saint Marinus, a stonemason from the then Roman island of Rab, in modern-day Croatia. Born in AD 275, Marinus participated in the reconstruction of Rimini's city walls after their destruction by Liburnian pirates. Marinus then went on to find an independent monastic community on Monte Titano in AD 301; thus, San Marino lays claim to being the oldest extant sovereign state, as well as the oldest constitutional republic.San Marino's politics are ruled by its constitution, which dictates that every six months San Marino's parliament must elect two Captains Regent. The Captain Regents have equal powers, and are free to exercise them within the limits of the constitution and parliamentary legislation until their term expires.\nThe country's economy is mainly based on finance, industry, services and tourism. It is one of the wealthiest countries in the world in terms of GDP per capita, with a figure comparable to the most developed European regions. San Marino is considered to have a highly stable economy, with one of the lowest unemployment rates in Europe, no national debt and a budget surplus.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSaint Marinus left the island of Rab in present-day Croatia with his lifelong friend Leo, and went to the city of Rimini as a stonemason. After the Diocletianic Persecution following his Christian sermons, he escaped to the nearby Monte Titano, where he built a small church and thus founded what is now the city and state of San Marino.\nThe official founding date is 3 September 301. In 1320 the community of Chiesanuova chose to join the country. In 1463 San Marino was extended with the communities of Faetano, Fiorentino, Montegiardino, and Serravalle, after which the country's borders have remained unchanged.In 1503, Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander VI occupied the Republic for six months until his father's successor, Pope Julius II, intervened and restored the country's independence.On June 4, 1543 Fabiano di Monte San Savino, nephew of the later Pope Julius III, attempted to conquer the republic, but his infantry and cavalry failed as they got lost in a dense fog, which the Sammarinese attributed to Saint Quirinus, whose feast day it was.After the Duchy of Urbino was annexed by the Papal States in 1625, San Marino became an enclave within the Papal States, something which led to its seeking the formal protection of the Papal States in 1631, but this never equalled a de facto Papal control of the republic.The country was occupied on October 17, 1739 by the legate (Papal governor) of Ravenna, Cardinal Giulio Alberoni, but the independence was restored by Pope Clement XII on February 5, 1740, the feast day of Saint Agatha, after which she became a patron saint of the republic.The advance of Napoleon's army in 1797 presented a brief threat to the independence of San Marino, but the country was saved from losing its liberty thanks to one of its regents, Antonio Onofri, who managed to gain the respect and friendship of Napoleon. Thanks to his intervention, Napoleon, in a letter delivered to Gaspard Monge, scientist and commissary of the French Government for Science and Art, promised to guarantee and protect the independence of the Republic, even offering to extend its territory according to its needs. The offer was declined by the regents, fearing future retaliation from other states' revanchism.\n\nDuring the later phase of the Italian unification process in the 19th century, San Marino served as a refuge for many people persecuted because of their support for unification, including Giuseppe Garibaldi and his wife Anita.\nThe government of San Marino made United States President Abraham Lincoln an honorary citizen. He wrote in reply, saying that the republic proved that \"government founded on republican principles is capable of being so administered as to be secure and enduring.\"During World War I, when Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915, San Marino remained neutral and Italy adopted a hostile view of Sammarinese neutrality, suspecting that San Marino could harbour Austrian spies who could be given access to its new radiotelegraph station. Italy tried to forcibly establish a detachment of Carabinieri in the republic and then cut the republic's telephone lines when it did not comply. Two groups of ten volunteers joined Italian forces in the fighting on the Italian front, the first as combatants and the second as a medical corps operating a Red Cross field hospital. The existence of this hospital later caused Austria-Hungary to suspend diplomatic relations with San Marino.After the war, San Marino suffered from high rates of unemployment and inflation, leading to increased tensions between the lower and middle classes. The latter, fearing that the moderate government of San Marino would make concessions to the lower class majority, began to show support for the Sammarinese Fascist Party (Partito Fascista Sammarinese, PFS), founded in 1922 and styled largely on their Italian counterpart. PFS rule lasted from 1923 to 1943, and during this time they often sought support from Benito Mussolini's fascist government in Italy.\n\nDuring World War II, San Marino remained neutral, although it was wrongly reported in an article from The New York Times that it had declared war on the United Kingdom on 17 September 1940. The Sammarinese government later transmitted a message to the British government stating that they had not declared war on the United Kingdom.Three days after the fall of Benito Mussolini in Italy, PFS rule collapsed and the new government declared neutrality in the conflict. The Fascists regained power on 1 April 1944 but kept neutrality intact. Despite that, on 26 June 1944, San Marino was bombed by the Royal Air Force, in the belief that San Marino had been overrun by German forces and was being used to amass stores and ammunition. The Sammarinese government declared on the same day that no military installations or equipment were located on its territory, and that no belligerent forces had been allowed to enter. San Marino accepted thousands of civilian refugees when Allied forces went over the Gothic Line. In September 1944, it was briefly occupied by German forces, who were defeated by Allied forces in the Battle of San Marino.\nSan Marino had the world's first democratically elected communist government \u2013 a coalition between the Sammarinese Communist Party and the Sammarinese Socialist Party, which held office between 1945 and 1957.San Marino is the world's smallest republic, although when Nauru gained independence in 1968 it challenged that claim, Nauru's land mass being only 21 km2 (8.1 sq mi). However Nauru's jurisdiction over its surrounding waters covers 431,000 km2 (166,000 sq mi), an area thousands of times greater than the territory of San Marino. San Marino became a member of the Council of Europe in 1988 and of the United Nations in 1992. It is neither a member of the European Union nor of the Eurozone, although it uses the euro as its currency.\nDuring the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic, as of June 2020, San Marino had the highest death rate per capita of any country.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSan Marino is an enclave (landlocked) surrounded by Italy in Southern Europe, on the border between the regions of Emilia Romagna and Marche and about 10 km (6.21 mi) from the Adriatic coast at Rimini. Its hilly topography, with no flat ground, is part of the Apennine mountain range. The highest point in the country, the summit of Monte Titano, is 749 m (2,457 ft) above sea level. San Marino has no still or contained bodies of water of any significant size.\nIt is one of only three countries in the world to be completely enclosed by another country (the others being Vatican City, also enclosed by Italy, and Lesotho, enclosed by South Africa). It is the third smallest country in Europe, after Vatican City and Monaco, and the fifth smallest country in the world.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of San Marino is a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa), with continental influences, having warm summers and cool winters that are typical of inland areas of the central Italian peninsula. Snowfalls are common and heavy almost every winter, especially above 400\u2013500 m of altitude.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nSan Marino has the political framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic: the captains regent are both heads of state and heads of government, and there is a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Grand and General Council. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.\nSan Marino is considered to have the earliest written governing documents still in effect, as the Statues of 1600 are still at the core of its constitutional framework.San Marino was originally led by the Arengo, initially formed from the heads of each family. In the 13th century, power was given to the Grand and General Council. In 1243, the first two captains regent were nominated by the Council. Still today, Captains Regent are elected every six months by the Council.\nThe legislature of the republic is the Grand and General Council (Consiglio grande e generale). The Council is a unicameral legislature with 60 members. There are elections every five years by proportional representation in all nine administrative districts. These districts (townships) correspond to the old parishes of the republic. All citizens 18 years or older are eligible to vote.\nBesides general legislation, the Grand and General Council approves the budget and elects the captains regent, the State Congress (composed of ten secretaries with executive power), the Council of Twelve (which forms the judicial branch during the period of legislature of the Council), the Advising Commissions, and the Government Unions. The council also has the power to ratify treaties with other countries. The council is divided into five different Advising Commissions consisting of fifteen councilors who examine, propose, and discuss the implementation of new laws that are on their way to being presented on the floor of the council.\nEvery six months, the council elects two captains regents to be the heads of state. The regents are chosen from opposing parties so that there is a balance of power. They serve a six-month term. The investiture of the captains regent takes place on 1 April and 1 October in every year. Once this term is over, citizens have three days in which to file complaints about the captains' activities. If they warrant it, judicial proceedings against the ex-head(s) of state can be initiated.\nThe practice of having two heads of state, like Roman consuls, chosen in frequent elections, is derived directly from the customs of the Roman Republic. The Council is equivalent to the Roman Senate; the captains regent, to the consuls of ancient Rome. It is thought the inhabitants of the area came together as Roman rule collapsed to form a rudimentary government for their own protection from foreign rule.\nSan Marino is a multi-party democratic republic. A new election law in 2008 raised the threshold for small parties entering Parliament, causing political parties to organise themselves into two alliances: the right-wing Pact for San Marino, led by the San Marinese Christian Democratic Party; and the left-wing Reforms and Freedom, led by the Party of Socialists and Democrats, a merger of the Socialist Party of San Marino and the former communist Party of Democrats. The 2008 general election was won by the Pact for San Marino with 35 seats in the Grand and General Council against Reforms and Freedom's 25.\nOn 1 October 2007, Mirko Tomassoni was elected as among the heads of state, making him the first disabled person ever to have been elected as captain regent.San Marino has had more female heads of state than any other country: 15 as of October 2014, including three who served twice. With regard to the legal profession, while the Order of Lawyers and Notaries of the Republic of San Marino [Ordine degli Avvocati e Notai della Repubblica di San Marino] exists, there is no clear indication as to how demographic groups have fared in the legal field.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\n\n==== Municipalities ====\n\nSan Marino is divided into the following nine municipalities, known locally as castelli (meaning \"castles\"):\n\nSan Marino (City of San Marino, officially Citt\u00e0 di San Marino) is the capital.There are also eight minor municipalities:\n\nAcquaviva\nBorgo Maggiore\nChiesanuova\nDomagnano\nFaetano\nFiorentino\nMontegiardino\nSerravalleThe largest settlement of the Republic is Dogana, which is not an autonomous castello, but rather belongs to the Castello of Serravalle.\nIn a similar way to an Italian comune, each castello includes a main settlement, called capoluogo, which is the seat of the castello, and some even smaller localities known as frazioni.\n\n\n==== Curacies ====\nThe republic is made up of 43 parishes named curacies (It: curazie):C\u00e0 Berlone, C\u00e0 Chiavello, C\u00e0 Giannino, C\u00e0 Melone, C\u00e0 Ragni, C\u00e0 Rigo, Cailungo, Caladino, Calligaria, Canepa, Capanne, Casole, Castellaro, Cerbaiola, Cinque Vie, Confine, Corianino, Crociale, Dogana, Falciano, Fiorina, Galavotto, Gualdicciolo, La Serra, Lesignano, Molarini, Montalbo, Monte Pulito, Murata, Pianacci, Piandivello, Poggio Casalino, Poggio Chiesanuova, Ponte Mellini, Rovereta, San Giovanni sotto le Penne, Santa Mustiola, Spaccio Giannoni, Teglio, Torraccia, Valdragone, Valgiurata and Ventoso.\n\n\n=== Military ===\n\nSan Marino's military forces are among the smallest in the world. National defence is, by arrangement, the responsibility of Italy's armed forces. Different branches have varied functions, including: performing ceremonial duties; patrolling borders; mounting guard at government buildings; and assisting police in major criminal cases. The police are not included in the military of San Marino.\n\n\n==== Crossbow Corps ====\nOnce at the heart of San Marino's army, the Crossbow Corps is now a ceremonial force of approximately 80 volunteers. Since 1295, the Crossbow Corps has provided demonstrations of crossbow shooting at festivals. Its uniform design is medieval. While still a statutory military unit, the Crossbow Corps has no military function today.\n\n\n==== Guard of the Rock ====\n\nThe Guard of the Rock is a front-line military unit in the San Marino armed forces, a state border patrol, with responsibility for patrolling borders and defending them. In their role as Fortress Guards they are responsible for guarding the Palazzo Pubblico in San Marino City, the seat of national government.\nIn this role they are the forces most visible to tourists, and are known for their colourful ceremony of Changing the Guard. Under the 1987 statute the Guard of the Rock are all enrolled as \"Criminal Police Officers\" (in addition to their military role) and assist the police in investigating major crime. The uniform of the Guard of the Rock is a distinctive red and green.\n\n\n==== Guard of the Grand and General Council ====\nThe Guard of the Grand and General Council commonly known as The Guard of the Council or locally as the \"Guard of Nobles\", formed in 1741, is a volunteer unit with ceremonial duties. Due to its striking blue, white, and gold uniform, it is perhaps the best-known part of the Sammarinese military, and appears on countless postcard views of the republic. The functions of the Guard of the Council are to protect the captains regent, and to defend the Grand and General Council during its formal sessions. They also act as ceremonial bodyguards to government officials at both state and church festivals.\n\n\n==== Company of Uniformed Militia ====\nIn former times, all families with two or more adult male members were required to enroll half of them in the Company of Uniformed Militia. This unit remains the basic fighting force of the armed forces of San Marino, but is largely ceremonial. It is a matter of civic pride for many Sammarinese to belong to the force, and all citizens with at least six years residence in the republic are entitled to enroll.\nThe uniform is dark blue, with a kepi bearing a blue and white plume. The ceremonial form of the uniform includes a white cross-strap, and white and blue sash, white epaulets, and white decorated cuffs.\n\n\n==== Military Ensemble ====\nFormally this is part of the Army Militia, and is the ceremonial military band of San Marino. It consists of approximately 60 musicians. The uniform is similar to that of the Army Militia. Military Ensemble music accompanies most state occasions in the republic.\n\n\n==== Gendarmerie ====\nEstablished in 1842, the Gendarmerie of San Marino is a militarised law enforcement agency. Its members are full-time and have responsibility for the protection of citizens and property, and the preservation of law and order.\nThe entire military corps of San Marino depends upon the co-operation of full-time forces and their retained (volunteer) colleagues, known as the Corpi Militari Volontari, or Voluntary Military Force.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nSan Marino is a developed country and although it is not a European Union member, it is allowed to use the euro as its currency by arrangement with the Council of the European Union; it is also granted the right to use its own designs on the national side of the euro coins. Before the euro, the Sammarinese lira was pegged to, and exchangeable with, the Italian lira. The small number of Sammarinese euro coins, as was the case with the lira before it, are primarily of interest to coin collectors.\nSan Marino's per capita GDP and standard of living are comparable to that of Italy. Key industries include banking, electronics, and ceramics. The main agricultural products are wine and cheese. San Marino imports mainly staple goods from Italy.\nSan Marino's postage stamps, which are valid for mail posted in the country, are mostly sold to philatelists and are an important source of income. San Marino is no longer a member of the Small European Postal Administration Cooperation.It has the world's highest rate of car ownership, being the only country with more vehicles than people.\n\n\n=== Taxation ===\nThe corporate profits tax rate in San Marino is 17%, capital gains are subject to a five per cent tax, and active interest is subject to a 11% withholding tax. Several benefits apply to new businesses, which can strongly reduced the amount of taxes to be paid.\nThe personal income tax (IGR, Italian: Imposta Generale sui Redditi) was introduced in 1984 and it was heavily reformed in 2013 with the goal of increasing fiscal revenue. The nominal tax rate ranges from 9% for an annual revenue below \u20ac10,000 to 35% for revenues above \u20ac80,000.\nIn 1972, a value-added tax (VAT) system was introduced in Italy, and an equivalent tax was introduced also in San Marino, in accordance with the 1939 friendship treaty. However, this tax is not a standard value-added tax, but rather it is an import tax, thus, it is levied only on imported goods and raw resources. For this reason it is locally best known as single stage tax (Italian: imposta monofase), as it is only applied one time during importation, while VAT is applied at every exchange. Furthermore, while VAT also applies to services, the import tax only applies on physical goods. Another important difference is that while VAT is computed on the final price paid by the consumer, the import tax is levied on the importation cost paid by the company, which is generally much lower.\nUnder the European Union customs agreement, San Marino import tax is considered equivalent to the European VAT system. A separate tax on services, with a rate of 3%, has been introduced in 2011. The introduction of a true VAT system, not dissimilar from the European one, is under development.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nThe tourism sector contributes over 22% of San Marino's GDP, with approximately 2 million tourists having visited in 2014.\n\n\n=== Conventions with Italy ===\nSan Marino and Italy have engaged in conventions since 1862, dictating some economic activities in San Marino's territory.\nCultivation of tobacco and production of goods which are subject to Italy's government monopoly are forbidden in San Marino. Direct import is forbidden; all goods coming from a third party have to travel through Italy before reaching the country. Although it is allowed to print its own postal stamps, San Marino is not allowed to coin its own currency and is obliged to use Italy's mint; the agreement does not affect the right of the Republic of San Marino to continue to issue gold coins denominated in Scudi (legal value of 1 gold Scudo is 37.50 euros). Gambling is legal and regulated; however, casinos were outlawed prior to 2007. There is currently one legally operating casino.\nIn exchange for these limitations, Italy provides San Marino with an annual stipend, and at cost, sea salt (not more than 250 tonnes per year), tobacco (40 tonnes), cigarettes (20 tonnes) and matches (unlimited amount).At the border there are no formalities with Italy. However, at the tourist office visitors can purchase officially cancelled souvenir stamps for their passports.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\n\nSan Marino has a population of approximately 33,000, with 4,800 foreign residents, most of whom are Italian citizens. Another 12,000 Sammarinese live abroad (5,700 in Italy, 3,000 in the US, 1,900 in France and 1,600 in Argentina).\nThe first census since 1976 was conducted in 2010. Results were expected by the end of 2011; however, 13% of families did not return their forms.\nThe primary language spoken is Italian; Romagnol is also widely spoken.\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\nGiovanni Battista Belluzzi (1506 in San Marino \u2013 1554) an architect\nFrancesco Maria Marini (di Pesaro) (1630\u20131686), a composer, playwright, and Catholic archbishop\nAntonio Onofri (1759-1825), statesman, \"Father of his Country.\"\nLittle Tony (1941\u20132013), a pop and rock musician\nPasquale Valentini (born 1953 in San Marino), a politician who has held multiple ministerial posts\nMassimo Bonini (born 1959 in San Marino), a football player who played for Juventus\nMarco Macina (born 30 September 1964 in San Marino), a footballer who played for Bologna FC, Parma, Reggiana and AC Milan.\nValentina Monetta (born 1 March 1975 in San Marino), a singer who represented San Marino four times in the Eurovision Song Contest\nSimone Pacini (born 1981 in San Marino), a footballer who plays for local club Folgore as a midfielder\nManuel Poggiali (born 1983 in San Marino), a Grand Prix motorcycle road racing World Champion\nAlex De Angelis (born 1984 in Rimini), a Grand Prix motorcycle road racer\nDavide Simoncini (born 30 August 1986 in San Marino), a footballer who plays as a defender for San Marino club A.C. Libertas and San Marino national football team\nAldo Junior Simoncini (born 30 August 1986 in San Marino), a footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for San Marino club A.C. Libertas and San Marino national football team\nAlessandra Perilli (born 1988), shooting Olympian\nAlessandro Bianchi (born 19 July 1989 in San Marino), a San Marino international footballer who plays as a forward\nSimone Benedettini (born 1997 in San Marino), a footballer who plays as a goalkeeper\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nSan Marino is a predominantly Catholic state\u2014over 97% of the population profess the Roman Catholic faith, but Catholicism is not an established religion. Approximately half of those who profess to be Catholic practice the faith. There is no episcopal see in San Marino, although its name is part of the present diocesan title. Historically, the various parishes in San Marino were divided between two Italian dioceses, mostly in the Diocese of Montefeltro, and partly in the Diocese of Rimini. In 1977, the border between Montefeltro and Rimini was readjusted so that all of San Marino fell within the diocese of Montefeltro. The bishop of Montefeltro-San Marino resides in Pennabilli, in Italy's province of Pesaro e Urbino.\nThere is a provision under the income tax rules that the taxpayers have the right to request for allocation of 0.3% of their income tax to the Catholic Church or to charities. The churches include the two religious groups of the Waldensian Church and Jehovah's Witnesses.\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of San Marino-Montefeltro was until 1977 the historic diocese of Montefeltro. It is a suffragan of the archdiocese of Ravenna-Cervia. The current diocese includes all the parishes of San Marino. The earliest mention of Montefeltro, as Mona Feretri, is in the diplomas by which Charlemagne confirmed the donation of Pepin. The first known bishop of Montefeltro was Agatho (826), whose residence was at San Leo. Under Bishop Flaminios Dondi (1724) the see was again transferred to San Leo, but later it returned to Pennabilli. The historic diocese was a suffragan of the archdiocese of Urbino. Since 1988, there is formally an apostolic nunciature to the republic, but it is vested in the nuncio to Italy.\nThere has been a Jewish presence in San Marino for at least 600 years. The first mention of Jews in San Marino dates to the late 14th century, in official documents recording the business transactions of Jews. There are many documents throughout the 15th to 17th centuries describing Jewish dealings and verifying the presence of a Jewish community in San Marino. Jews were permitted official protection by the government.\nDuring World War II, San Marino provided a haven for more than 100,000 Italians and Jews (approximately 10 times the Sammarinese population at the time) from Nazi persecution. As of 2012, few Jews remain. In 2019 it has been inaugurated the 'Chapel of three religions', the first ever building of its kind devoted to interfaith dialogue.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nThere are 220 km (140 mi) of roads in the country, the main road being the San Marino Highway. Authorities license private vehicles with distinctive Sammarinese license plates, which are white with blue figures and the coat of arms, usually a letter followed by up to four numbers. Many vehicles also carry the international vehicle identification code (in black on a white oval sticker), which is \"RSM\".\nThere are no public airports in San Marino, but there is a small private airstrip located in Torraccia and an international heliport located in Borgo Maggiore. Most tourists who arrive by air land at Federico Fellini International Airport close to the city of Rimini, then make the transfer by bus.\nTwo rivers flow through San Marino, but there is no major water transport, and no port or harbour.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nSan Marino has limited public transport facilities. There is a regular bus service between Rimini and the city of San Marino that is popular with both tourists and workers commuting to San Marino from Italy. This service stops at approximately 20 locations in Rimini and within San Marino, with its two terminus stops at Rimini railway station and San Marino coach station.\nA limited licensed taxi service operates nationwide. There are seven licensed taxi companies operating in the republic, and Italian taxis regularly operate within San Marino when carrying passengers picked up in Italian territory.\n\nThere is a 1.5 km (0.93 mi) aerial tramway connecting the City of San Marino on top of Monte Titano with Borgo Maggiore, a major town in the republic, with the second largest population of any Sammarinese settlement. From here a further connection is available to the nation's largest settlement, Dogana, via the local bus service.\nTwo aerial tramway cars (gondolas) operate, with service provided at roughly 15-minute intervals throughout the day. A third vehicle is available on the system, a service car for the use of engineers maintaining the tramway.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\n\nToday, there is no railway in San Marino, but for a short period before World War II, it had a single narrow-gauge line called the Ferrovia Rimini\u2013San Marino which connected the country with the Italian rail network at Rimini. Because of the difficulties in accessing the capital, City of San Marino, with its mountain-top location, the terminus station was planned to be located in the village of Valdragone, but was extended to reach the capital through a steep and winding track comprising many tunnels. The railway was opened on 12 June 1932.\nAn advanced system for its time, it was an electric railway, powered from overhead cables. It was well built and had a high frequency of passengers, but was almost completely destroyed during World War II. Many facilities such as bridges, tunnels, and stations remain visible today, and some have been converted to parks, public footpaths, or traffic routes.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe Three Towers of San Marino are located on the three peaks of Monte Titano in the capital. They are depicted on both the flag of San Marino and its coat of arms. The three towers are: Guaita, the oldest of the three (it was constructed in the 11th century); the 13th-century Cesta, located on the highest of Monte Titano's summits; and the 14th-century Montale, on the smallest of Monte Titano's summits, still privately owned.\n\n\n=== University ===\nThe Universit\u00e0 degli Studi della Repubblica di San Marino (University of the Republic of San Marino) is the main university, which includes the Scuola Superiore di Studi Storici di San Marino (Graduate School of Historical Studies), a distinguished research and advanced international study centre governed by an international Scientific Committee coordinated by the emeritus historian Luciano Canfora. Other important institutes are the Istituto Musicale Sammarinese (Sammarinese Musical Institute) and the Akademio Internacia de la Sciencoj San Marino or Accademia Internazionale delle Scienze San Marino (International Academy of Sciences San Marino). The latter is known for adopting Esperanto as the language for teaching and for scientific publications; further, it makes wide use of electronic educational technology (also called e-learning).\nItalian author Umberto Eco had attempted to create a \"university without physical structures\" in San Marino.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nIn San Marino football is the most popular sport. Basketball and volleyball are also popular. The three sports have their own federations, the San Marino Football Federation, the San Marino Basketball Federation and the San Marino Volleyball Federation.\nThe San Marino national football team has had little success, being made up of part-timers, never qualifying for a major tournament, and recording only one win in over 25 years of its history, a 1\u20130 victory in 2004 against Liechtenstein. They have drawn four more, with their most notable result being a 1993 0\u20130 draw with Turkey during the European qualifiers for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. In the same qualifying competition Davide Gualtieri scored a goal 8.3 seconds into a match against England; this goal held the record for the fastest in international football until 2016.\n\nA Formula One race, the San Marino Grand Prix, was named after the state, although it did not take place there. Instead, it was held at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in the Italian town of Imola, about 100 km (60 mi) northwest of San Marino. Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna suffered fatal accidents a day apart during the 1994 Grand Prix. This international event was removed from the calendar in 2007.\nThe San Marino and Rimini's Coast motorcycle Grand Prix was reinstated in the schedule in 2007 and takes place at the Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli, as does San Marino's round of the World Superbike Championship.\nSan Marino has a professional baseball team which plays in Italy's top division. It has participated in the European Cup tournament for the continent's top club sides several times, hosting the event in 1996, 2000, 2004, and 2007. It won the championship in 2006 and was a runner-up in 2010.Together with Italy, San Marino held the 2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, with teams playing at the Stadio Olimpico in Serravalle.\nSan Marino has had little success at the Olympic Games, winning no medals.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nThe cuisine of San Marino is extremely similar to Italian, especially that of the adjoining Emilia-Romagna and Marche regions, but it has a number of its own unique dishes and products. Its best known is probably the Torta Tre Monti (\"Cake of the Three Mountains\" or \"Cake of the Three Towers\"), a wafer layered cake covered in chocolate depicting the Three Towers of San Marino. The country also has a small wine industry.\n\n\n=== UNESCO ===\nThe site San Marino: Historic Centre and Mount Titano became part of the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2008. The decision was taken during the 32nd Session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee composed of 21 Countries convened in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nThe country has a long and rich musical tradition, closely linked to that of Italy, but which is also highly independent in itself. A well-known 17th-century composer is Francesco Maria Marini. The pop singer Little Tony achieved considerable success in the United Kingdom and Italy in the 1950s and 1960s.\nSan Marino has taken part in the Eurovision Song Contest ten times, achieving two final qualifications to date (with then-three, eventually four-time contestant and San Marino native Valentina Monetta with \"Maybe\" in 2014 and Turkish singer Serhat with \"Say Na Na Na\" who achieved 19th place in the final in 2019).\n\n\n=== Public holidays and festivals ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAssociazione Guide Esploratori Cattolici Sammarinesi\nCity-state\nIndex of San Marino\u2013related articles\nOutline of San Marino\nPostage stamps and postal history of San Marino\nTelecommunications in San Marino\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Geographic data related to San Marino at OpenStreetMap\nSan Marino at Curlie\n Wikimedia Atlas of San Marino",

        "wiki": "Rimini ( RIM-in-ee, Italian: [\u02c8ri\u02d0mini] (listen); Romagnol: R\u00e9min; Latin: Ariminum) is a city in the Emilia-Romagna region of northern Italy and capital city of the Province of Rimini. It sprawls along the Adriatic Sea, on the coast between the rivers Marecchia (the ancient Ariminus) and Ausa (ancient Aprusa). It is one of the most notable seaside resorts in Europe with revenue from both internal and international tourism forming a significant portion of the city's economy. The first bathing establishment opened in 1843. Rimini is an art city with ancient Roman and Renaissance monuments, and is also the birthplace of the famous film director Federico Fellini.\nThe city was founded by the Romans in 268 BC. Throughout Roman times, Rimini was a key communications link between the north and south of the peninsula. On its soil, Roman emperors erected monuments such as the Arch of Augustus and the Tiberius Bridge to mark the beginning and the end of the Decumanus of Rimini. During the Renaissance, the city benefited from the court of the House of Malatesta, which hosted artists like Leonardo da Vinci and produced works such as the Tempio Malatestiano. The main monuments in Rimini are the Tiberius Bridge and the Arch of Augustus.\nIn the 19th century, Rimini was one of the most active cities on the revolutionary front, hosting many of the movements seeking to achieve Italian unification. In the course of World War II, the city was the scene of numerous clashes and bombings, but also of a fierce partisan resistance that earned it the honour of a gold medal for civic valour. In recent years it has become one of the most important sites for trade fairs and conferences in Italy.\nAs of 31 May 2019, Rimini's urban area was home to 150,951 people, with approximately 325,000 living in the eponymous province, making it the twenty-eighth largest city in Italy.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient history ===\n\nThe area was part of the Etruscan civilization until the arrival of the Celts, who held it from the 6th century BC until their defeat by the Umbri in 283 BC. In 268 BC at the mouth of the Ariminus (now called the Marecchia), the Roman Republic founded the colonia of Ariminum.\nThe city was involved in the civil wars but remained faithful to the popular party and to its leaders, firstly Gaius Marius, and then Julius Caesar. After crossing the Rubicon, the latter made his legendary appeal to the legions in the Forum of Rimini.\nAriminum was seen as a bastion against invaders from Celts and also as a springboard for conquering the Padana plain. As the terminus of the Via Flaminia, which ended in the town at the surviving prestigious Arch of Augustus (erected 27 BC), Rimini was a road junction connecting central and northern Italy by the Via Aemilia that led to Piacenza and the Via Popilia that extended northwards; it also opened up trade by sea and river. Remains of the amphitheatre that could seat 12,000 people, and a five-arched bridge of Istrian stone completed by Tiberius (21 AD) are still visible. Later Galla Placidia built the church of Santo Stefano. The evidence that Rimini is of Roman origins is illustrated by the city being divided by two main streets, the Cardo and the Decumanus.\nThe end of Roman rule was marked by destruction caused by invasions and wars, but also by the establishment of the palaces of the Imperial officers and the first churches, the symbol of the spread of Christianity that held the important Council of Ariminum in the city in 359.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nWhen the Ostrogoths conquered Rimini in 493, Odoacer, besieged in Ravenna, had to capitulate. During the Gothic War (535\u2013554), Rimini was taken and retaken many times. In its vicinity the Byzantine general Narses overthrew (553) the Alamanni. Under the Byzantine rule, it belonged to the Pentapolis, part of the Exarchate of Ravenna.\nIn 728, it was taken with many other cities by Liutprand, King of the Lombards but returned to the Byzantines about 735. Pepin the Short gave it to the Holy See, but during the wars of the popes and the Italian cities against the emperors, Rimini sided with the latter.\nIn the 13th century, it suffered from the discords of the Gambacari and Ansidei families. The city became a municipality in the 14th century, and with the arrival of the religious orders, numerous convents and churches were built, providing work for many illustrious artists. In fact, Giotto inspired the 14th-century School of Rimini, which was the expression of original cultural ferment.\nThe House of Malatesta emerged from the struggles between municipal factions with Malatesta da Verucchio, who in 1239 was named podest\u00e0 (chief magistrate) of the city. Despite interruptions, his family held authority until 1528. In 1312 he was succeeded by Malatestino Malatesta, first signore (lord) of the city and Pandolfo I Malatesta, the latter's brother, named by Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, as imperial vicar of Romagna. Ferrantino, son of Malatesta II (1335), was opposed by his cousin Ramberto and by Cardinal Bertrand du Pouget (1331), legate of Pope John XXII. Malatesta II was also lord of Pesaro. He was succeeded by Malatesta Ungaro (1373) and Galeotto I Malatesta, uncle of the former (1385), lord also of Fano (from 1340), Pesaro, and Cesena (1378).\nHis son Carlo I Malatesta, one of the most respected condottieri of the time, enlarged the Riminese possessions and restored the port. Carlo died childless in 1429, and the lordship was divided into three parts, Rimini going to Galeotto Roberto Malatesta, a Catholic zealot who turned out to be totally inadequate for the role. The Pesarese line of the Malatestas tried, in fact, to take advantage of his weakness and to capture the city, but Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, Carlo's nephew, who was only 14 at the time, intervened to save it. Galeotto retired to a convent, and Sigismondo obtained the rule of Rimini.\nSigismondo Pandolfo was the most famous lord of Rimini. In 1433, Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, sojourned in the city and for a while he was the commander-in-chief of the Papal armies. A skilled general, Sigismondo often acted as condottiero for other states to gain money to embellish it (he was also a dilettante poet). He had the famous Tempio Malatestiano rebuilt by Leon Battista Alberti. However, after the rise of Pope Pius II, he had to fight constantly for the independence of the city. In 1463 he was forced to submit to Pius II, who left him only Rimini and little more; Roberto Malatesta, his son (1482), under Pope Paul II, nearly lost his state, but under Pope Sixtus IV, became the commanding officer of the pontifical army against Ferdinand of Naples. Sigismondo was, however, defeated by Neapolitan forces in the battle of Campomorto (1482). Pandolfo IV, his son (1500), lost Rimini to Cesare Borgia, after whose overthrow it fell to Venice (1503\u20131509), but it was later retaken by Pope Julius II and incorporated into the Papal States. After the death of Pope Leo X, Pandolfo returned for several months, and with his son Sigismondo Malatesta held a rule which looked tyrannous even for the time. Pope Adrian VI expelled him again and gave Rimini to the Duke of Urbino, the pope's vicar in Romagna. In 1527 Sigismondo managed to regain the city, but in the following year the Malatesta dominion died forever.\n\n\n=== Renaissance and Enlightment ===\n\nAt the beginning of the 16th century, Rimini, now a secondary town of the Papal States, was ruled by an Apostolic Legate. Towards the end of the 16th century, the municipal square (now Piazza Cavour), which had been closed off on a site where the Poletti Theatre was subsequently built, was redesigned. The statue of Pope Paul V has stood in the centre of the square next to the fountain since 1614.\nIn the 16th century, the 'grand square' (now the Piazza Tre Martiri in honor of three civilians hanged by the retreating Nazis at the end of World War II), which was where markets and tournaments were held, underwent various changes. A small temple dedicated to Saint Anthony of Padua and a clock tower were built there, giving the square its present shape and size.\nUntil the 18th century raiding armies, earthquakes, famines, floods and pirate attacks ravaged the city. In this gloomy situation and due to a weakened local economy, fishing took on great importance, a fact testified by the construction of structures such as the fish market and the lighthouse.\nIn 1797, Rimini, along with the rest of Romagna, was affected by the passage of the Napoleonic army and became part of the Cisalpine Republic. Napoleonic policy suppressed the monastic orders, confiscating their property and thus dispersing a substantial heritage, and demolished many churches including the ancient cathedral of Santa Colomba.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nOn 30 March 1815, Joachim Murat launched his Rimini Proclamation to the Italian people from here, hoping to incite them to unity and independence. In 1845, a band of adventurers commanded by Ribbotti entered the city and proclaimed a constitution which was soon abolished. In 1860, Rimini and Romagna were incorporated into the Kingdom of Italy.\nThe city was transformed after the 1843 founding of the first bathing establishment and the Kursaal, a building constructed to host sumptuous social events, became the symbol of Rimini's status as a tourist resort. In just a few years, the seafront underwent considerable development work making Rimini 'the city of small villas'. At the beginning of the 20th century, The Grand Hotel, the city's first major accommodation facility, was built near the beach.\nDuring the first World War, Rimini and its surrounding infrastructure was one of the primary targets of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. After Italy's declaration of war on 15 May 1915, the Austro-Hungarian fleet left its harbours the same day and started its assault on the Adriatic coast between Venice and Barletta.\nDuring World War II, the city was torn apart by heavy bombardments and by the passage of the front over the Gothic Line during the Battle of Rimini and was eventually captured by Greek and Canadian forces. Following its liberation on September 21, 1944, reconstruction work began, culminating in huge development of the tourist industry in the city.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nRimini is situated at 44\u00b003\u203200\u2033 north and 12\u00b034\u203200\u2033 east, along the coast of the Adriatic sea, at the southeastern edge of Emilia-Romagna, at a short distance from Montefeltro and Marche. Rimini extends for 135.71 square km and borders the municipalities of Bellaria-Igea Marina, San Mauro Pascoli, and Santarcangelo di Romagna towards NW, Verucchio and Serravalle towards SW, Coriano towards S, and Riccione towards SE. The city is also located at the intersection of three Roman roads: Via Emilia, Via Popilia, and Via Flaminia. Viserba is the most important of Rimini's northern districts, with 8,556 inhabitants.\nRimini is located in a historically strategic position, at the extreme southern edge of the Po Valley, at the junction point of Northern and Central Italy.\nIt is surrounded towards southwest by the gently rolling hills of Covignano (153 metres high), Vergiano (81 m), San Martino Monte l'Abbate (57 m) and San Lorenzo in Correggiano (60 m), widely cultivated, with vineyards, olive groves and orchards, and dominated by ancient mansions. These hills, mostly made of clay and sand, connect the plains, created by the Marecchia and Ausa, the two most important rivers of Rimini territory, to the higher hills of the Apennines.\nThe Marecchia river runs through its valley and the plain in a very large riverbed and, after confluence with the Ausa, it flows into the Adriatic sea through a deviator between San Giuliano Mare and Rivabella, while the ancient riverbed is used in its last section as the city's harbour.\nThe Marecchia, usually with little water flow, was subjected to periodic, destructive floods near its mouth, where the riverbed became narrow after various bends: for this reason it was deviated north.  Ausa creek, which was the eastern limit of Rimini for many centuries, was deviated as well after World War II, and its original riverbed was filled and turned into an urban park.\nThe coastal strip, made of recent marine deposits, is edged by a fine sandy beach, 15 km long and up to 200 metres wide, interrupted only by the mouth of the rivers and gently shelving towards the sea. Along the coastline there is a low sandy cliff, created by sea rise around 4000 B.C., partly conserved north of Rimini, between Rivabella and Bellaria-Igea Marina, at a distance of about 1,300 metres from the coast.Rimini's territory, for its geographical position and its climatic features, is situated on the edge between the mediterranean and the central European phytoclimatic zones, and thus it represents an environment of notable naturalistic value.\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nRimini is the main centre of a 50 kilometres (31 miles) long coastal conurbation, which extends from Cervia to Gabicce Mare, including the seaside resorts of Cesenatico, Gatteo a Mare, Bellaria-Igea Marina, Riccione, Misano Adriatico and Cattolica. The conurbation has about 300,000 inhabitants and originated around the mid-20th century due to urban sprawl following intensive tourism development.\nThe city of Rimini includes the seaside localities and districts of Torre Pedrera, Viserbella, Viserba, Rivabella, San Giuliano Mare towards north and Bellariva, Marebello, Rivazzurra, Miramare towards south. These districts are important to tourism in Rimini.\nThe city proper includes the historic centre, the four ancient boroughs of S. Giuliano, S. Giovanni, S. Andrea and Marina, the seaside district of Marina Centro and various modern districts\u2014Celle, Marecchiese, INA Casa, V PEEP, Colonnella, Lagomaggio\u2014and outer suburbs such as Padulli, Spadarolo, Covignano, Grottarossa and Villaggio 1\u00b0 Maggio, located outside of the Adriatic Highway beltline. More outer suburbs are S. Giustina, S. Vito, Spadarolo, Vergiano, Corpol\u00f2 and Gaiofana.\nThe historic centre of Rimini, surrounded by the city walls built by Malatesta, and formerly bounded by the Marecchia and Ausa rivers, has a distinctive, regular urban structure of Roman origins. It was divided since the Middle Ages in four districts (Rioni): Cittadella, Clodio, Pomposo and Montecavallo. The boundaries of these districts are not known, but it is assumed that they followed the current Corso d'Augusto, Via Garibaldi, and Via Gambalunga. Additionally, the ancient coastline was situated much farther inland than today's; it gradually shifted outward over centuries and the new land was developed throughout the 20th century.Rione Cittadella, in the western area of the centre, was the most important district of the city and included the Municipal palaces, Castel Sismondo and the Cathedral of Santa Colomba. Rione Clodio, towards the north, was popular and a peculiar urban structure tied with the near Marecchia river. Rione Pomposo, the widest district of the city, included large orchards and convents. Rione Montecavallo, on the southern part of the historical centre, is characterized by bowed, irregular streets of medieval origins, by the Fossa Patara creek and a small hill called \"Montirone\".Outside of the city walls, there are four boroughs (Borghi), which were entirely incorporated to the city by the urban sprawl in early 20th century.Borgo S. Giuliano, along Via Emilia, dates back to the 11th century and was originally a fishermen's settlement. Dominated by the Church of San Giuliano, it is one of the most picturesque spots of the city, with narrow streets and squares, colourful small houses and many frescoes representing characters and places of Federico Fellini's films.\nBorgo S. Giovanni, on both sides of Via Flaminia, was populated by artisans and middle-class; Borgo S. Andrea, located outside of Porta Montanara, along Via Covignano, Via Montefeltro and Via Monte Titano, was strictly tied with agriculture and commerce of cows. Both these two boroughs were developed in 15th century; then they burned in a fire in 1469 and were rebuilt in 19th century, relocating small industries and manufactures, including a brick factory and a phosphorus matches factory.\nBorgo Marina, situated on the right bank of the Marecchia, was a portual borough, heavily transformed by Fascist demolitions and World War II bombings, which hit this area due to the proximity to the bridges of the city and the railway station.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nRimini has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa) moderated by the influence of the Adriatic sea, featuring the highest autumn and winter mean temperatures and the highest annual low temperatures in Emilia-Romagna.Precipitations are equally distributed during the year, with a peak in October (75 mm) and two slight minimums, in January (42 mm) and July (43 mm). In spring, autumn and winter precipitations mainly come from oceanic fronts, while in summer they are brought by thunderstorms, coming from the Apennines or the Po Valley.\nHumidity is high all year round, with a minimum of 72% in June and July and a maximum of 84% in November and December. Prevailing winds blow from W, S, E and NE. Southwesterly winds, known as libeccio or garbino, are foehn winds, which may bring warm temperatures in each season. On average, there are over 2,040 sunshine hours per year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nAs of 2019, Rimini has 150,951 inhabitants, with a density of about 1,100 inhabitants per square kilometre within the city limits.\nIn 1861, by the time of the first Italian census, the population was around 28,000; in 1931 it was more than double, 57,000.\nWith the increasing tourism development, population rapidly grew between 1951 and 1981, the fastest growing period for Rimini in the 20th century, when the city's population grew from 77,000 to over 128,000.During the 20th century, two former districts of Rimini got administrative autonomy, causing two distinct temporary drops in population totals: Riccione in 1922 and Bellaria-Igea Marina in 1956.\nForeign population is 18,396, (12.5% of the total), mainly from Eastern Europe, East Asia and North Africa. Between 1992 and 2014, foreign population grew from around 1,800 to over 18,000 units. \nThe most important foreign communities are Albanians (3,479), Romanians (2,904), Ukrainians (2,409), Chinese (1,197) and Moldovans (1,023). Other notable foreign groups in the city are Senegalese, Moroccans, Macedonians, Tunisians, Russians, Bangladeshis and Peruvians.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nRimini's population is mostly Catholic. The city is the seat of the Diocese of Rimini, a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Ravenna-Cervia.\nThe first cathedral of the diocese was the former Cathedral of Santa Colomba until 1798, when the title was transferred to the church of Sant'Agostino. Since 1809, Rimini's cathedral is the Tempio Malatestiano.\nBesides Roman Catholic churches, there are also Orthodox, Evangelical and Adventist churches. Between the 13th and 14th century, Rimini had a flourishing Jewish community, which built three distinct synagogues, all destroyed, formerly located around the area of Piazza Cavour, Via Cairoli and Santa Colomba.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nRimini is a major international tourist destination and seaside resort, among the most famous ones in Europe and the Mediterranean basin, thanks to a long sandy beach, well-equipped bathing establishments, theme parks and a number of opportunities for leisure and spare time. The economy of the city is entirely based on tourism, whose development started in the first half of the 19th century and increased after World War II.\nRimini's origins as a seaside resort date back to 1843, when the first \"Bathing Establishment\" was founded, the oldest one of the Adriatic Sea. The width of the beach, the gentle gradient of the sea bed, the equipment of bathing establishments, the luxurious hotels, the mildness of the climate, the richness of curative waters, the prestigious social events, made Rimini a renowned tourist destination among the Italian and European aristocracy.\n\nTourism in Rimini started as therapeutic stay (thalassotherapy, hydrotherapy and heliotherapy), evolving into elite vacation in the late 19th century, into middle-class tourism during the fascist era and finally into mass tourism in the postwar period.On summer nights, there is a festival called \"La Notte Rosa\".\nRimini concentrates a quarter of Emilia-Romagna's hotels, with over 1,000 hotels, 300 of which are open all year round, and hundreds of apartment hotels, apartments, holiday homes, bed & breakfast and campings. Tourism is mainly based on seaside holidays, but also includes trade fairs and conventions, events, nightlife, culture, wellness, food and wine.\nRimini is a leading trade fair and convention site in Italy, with an important trade fair (Rimini Fiera) and a convention centre (Palacongressi di Rimini).\nThe city's other economic sectors, such as services, commerce, construction industry, have been influenced by the development of tourism. Commerce is one of the main economic sectors, thanks to the presence of a large wholesale center, two hypermarkets, department stores, supermarkets and hundreds of shops and boutiques. Industry, less developed than tourism and services, includes various companies active in food industry, woodworking machineries, building constructions, furnishing, clothing and publishing. Notable companies are Bimota (motorcycles), SCM (woodworking machines), Trevi S.p.A. (electronic goods). Rimini is also seat of a historic railway works plant.Agriculture and fishing were the city's main economic sources until the early 20th century. Rimini boasts an important tradition in wine production (Sangiovese, Trebbiano, Rebola, Pagadebit, Albana wines) and an historic extra virgin olive oil production. The most common crops of the area, besides vineyards and olive groves, are orchards (peaches, nectarines, apricots, persimmons, apples, pears, cherries, kiwifruits and plums), vegetables and legumes (lettuce, zucchini, potatoes, tomatoes, beans, green beans, cauliflowers, fennels, strawberries), seminatives (wheat, barley, grain sorghum, corn, oat), sunflowers and canola. The fishing industry can count on a fleet of about 100 fishing boats, the most consistent of Rimini's fishing department, which includes the coast between Cattolica and Cesenatico.\n\n\n== Arts and culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe City Museum (Museo della Citt\u00e0), main museal institution of Rimini, was inaugurated as \"Archaeology Gallery\", at the ground floor of Palazzo Gambalunga in 1872, thanks to Riminese historian Luigi Tonini, active in researching and studying the local archaeological heritage. The Archaeology Gallery was the first museum of the city and was conceived as a collection of Etruscan civilization and Roman antiquities, found in Rimini and in the surrounding countryside.\nThe civic museum was arranged in San Francesco monastery in 1923 and in 1938 was enlarged with a section of Medieval Art. The objects avoided the destructions of World War II, being moved between 1940 and 1943 to two different shelters in Spadarolo and Novafeltria. In 1964, the collections were moved to Palazzo Visconti and finally, from 1990, to the Collegio dei Gesuiti, a large Jesuit convent designed by bolognese architect Alfonso Torreggiani, built in 1749.\n\nIn the Archaeological department are exhibited grave goods from Villanovian tombs of Verucchio and Covignano, architectural pieces, sculptures, mosaics, ceramics, coins of Republican and Imperial eras, and the exceptional medical kit from the Domus del Chirurgo. The collection of the Roman Lapidary, exhibited in the inner courtyard of the convent, has funerary monuments, epigraphies and milestones.\nThe Medieval and Modern Art departments include collections of paintings, sculptures and art objects by artists from Romagna (Giovanni da Rimini, Giuliano da Rimini, Guido Cagnacci), Emilia (Guercino, Vittorio Maria Bigari), Tuscany (Domenico Ghirlandaio, Agostino di Duccio) and Veneto (Giovanni Bellini), from 14th to 19th century. The City Museum arranges temporary exhibitions and promotes researches, study and restoration activities of the city's historical and artistic heritage.\nThe Fellini Museum (Museo Fellini), dedicated to Federico Fellini, houses temporary exhibitions of documents, drawings, scenographies and costumes related to the movie production of the famous film director.The Museum of Glances (Museo degli Sguardi), housed in Villa Alvarado, on Covignano hill, was instituted in 2005 acquiring the objects of the former Museum of Extra European Cultures \"Dinz Rialto\", founded in Rimini in 1972 by explorer Delfino Dinz Rialto, the art pieces of the former Missionary Museum of the Grazie and other private collections. The museum has over 3,000 objects coming from China, Oceania, Africa and pre-Columbian America, with paintings, sculptures, everyday objects, totems, masks, musical instruments and clothes illustrating how the Western world has looked at these territories' cultures through history.\nThe Museum of Small Fishing and Marine (Museo della Piccola Pesca e della Marineria), in Viserbella, shows the history of Rimini's Marine through a collection of boats, fishing tools, photographs and a large seashells collection, with pieces from all over the Mediterranean Sea.In the municipality of Rimini there are also two private museums: the Aviation Museum (Museo dell'Aviazione) in Sant'Aquilina, close to the boundary of the Republic of San Marino, and the National Museum of Motorcycle (Museo Nazionale del Motociclo) in Casalecchio.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nThe Gambalunghiana Library, historic institution founded in 1617 by jurist Alessandro Gambalunga, plays a leading role in the city's cultural life. The library has over 280,000 books, including 60,000 ancient books, 1,350 manuscripts, 6,000 prints and 80,000 photographs. Among the incunables, dated back from the 15th century, stand out De Claris mulieribus (1497) by Giacomo Filippo Foresti and De re militari by Roberto Valturio. The collection of illuminated manuscripts, coming from different cultural and linguistic European boundaries, includes the Regalis Historia by Frate Leonardo and De Civitate Dei by Saint Augustine.\n\n\n=== Theatre and Films ===\n\nThe first stable theatre in Rimini is documented since 1681, when the city council decided on the transformation of the Arengo's main hall into a large theatre hall, hosting shows of amateur dramatics companies and the young Carlo Goldoni, who was studying philosophy in the city at that time.\nBetween 1842 and 1857 the great Municipal Theatre Vittorio Emanuele II was built, designed in Neoclassical style by the architect Luigi Poletti, according to the traditional canons of the 19th-century Italian theatre. The theatre was inaugurated by Giuseppe Verdi, who directed \"L'Aroldo\", and hosted prestigious opera seasons until its destruction in 1943 due to aerial bombings. Since 1947, it has been called Amintore Galli Theatre. Since its closure, theatre shows has been hosted in the modern Teatro Ermete Novelli in Marina Centro.\nRimini appeared on the movie screen for the first time in some early footages, such as the documentary \"Rimini l'Ostenda d'Italia\" (1912), and in various Istituto Luce's newsreels in the Thirties. The film director Federico Fellini, was born and raised in Rimini, portrayed characters, places and atmospheres of his hometown through his movies, which however were almost entirely shot in Cinecitt\u00e0's studios in Rome: I Vitelloni, 8 e \u00bd (Oscar award in 1964), I clowns, Amarcord (Oscar award in 1975). Other Italian movies filmed in Rimini includes \"La prima notte di quiete\" by Valerio Zurlini, \"Rimini Rimini\" by Sergio Corbucci, \"Abbronzatissimi\" by Bruno Gaburro, \"Sole negli occhi\" by Andrea Porporati, \"Da zero a dieci\" by Luciano Ligabue and \"Non pensarci\" by Gianni Zanasi.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe earliest musician from Rimini was Saint Arduino (10th century); a musical tradition of some distinction was witnessed in the following century by the presence of a music school, named \"Scuola cantorum\", at the Cathedral of Santa Colomba. French composer Guillaume Dufay stayed in Rimini, at Malatesta's court until 1427. In 1518 Pietro Aaron became the first choirmaster of the Cathedral's chapel. In 1690 Carlo Tessarini, violinist and composer, was born in Rimini. The city also gave birth to the musician Benedetto Neri, professor at the Academy of Music in Milan.\nAmintore Galli, illustrious musicologist and composer born in Talamello in 1845, attended the city's Classical Lyceum before moving to Milan, where he studied at the Academy of Music; in 1945 the Municipal Theatre of Rimini was dedicated to him.Between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many social events and dance parties took place at the Bathing Establishment, hosting celebrities such as soprano Elena Bianchini-Cappelli and tenor Enrico Caruso.\nIn recent years, the city inspired the homonymous music album by Fabrizio De Andr\u00e9, released in 1978, and it is cited in various popular Italian and foreign songs by Fabrizio De Andr\u00e9, Francesco Guccini, Nino Rota, Elvis Costello, Fred Buscaglione. Also born in Rimini were the songwriter Samuele Bersani and the composer and music producer Carlo Alberto Rossi, author of some of Mina's songs.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nRimini's cuisine is simple and characterized by intense flavours, and it is indissolubly related to the traditions of rural culture, with peculiar influences due to the city's position between the sea and the hills, near the edge between Romagna and Marche.\nThe traditional first course is pasta, which includes regular pasta, pasta in broth and baked pasta, prepared in many different shapes. Almost all pasta dishes require a base of \"sfoglia\", a dough of eggs and flour, handmade with a rolling pin. First courses include cappelletti, passatelli in broth, lasagne, cannelloni, nidi di rondine, ravioli, tagliatelle, garganelli, maltagliati, gnocchi and strozzapreti, seasoned with bolognese sauce or a dressing of butter and sage.\nSecond courses include meat dishes, such as pollo alla cacciatora, rabbit in porchetta, meat-filled zucchini, sausages and mixed grilled meats, and fish dishes, like barbecues of atlantic mackerels, sardines, rotisseries of oily fishes, sepias with peas, fried squids and gianchetti (known here as \"omini nudi\").Piada is a flatbread of ancient traditions, thin and crumbly, obtained from a dough of flour, water, lard and salt, and baked on a scorching \"testo\" of terracotta or cast iron. It is often accompanied by grilled meats or fishes, sausages, gratin\u00e9e vegetables, salami, prosciutto, fresh cheeses and country herbs. Cassoni, are stuffed flatbreads similar to piada, with various fillings: country herbs, potatoes and sausages, tomato and mozzarella. Side dishes include mixed salads, gratin\u00e9e vegetables, roasted potatoes, saut\u00e9e bladder campion leaves, marinated olives with dill, garlic and orange zest.\nTraditional desserts are ciambella, Carnevale's fried fiocchetti and castagnole, piada dei morti (a doughnut with walnuts, raisins, pinenuts and almonds, prepared in November), zuppa inglese (a rich dessert with custard, savoiardi and liqueurs), caramelized figs, peaches in white wine and strawberries in red wine.\nTypical local products are squacquerone (a fresh cheese) and saba, a grape syrup used to prepare desserts. Quality extra virgin olive oil is traditionally produced in Rimini area since ancient times.\nThe most famous wines include Sangiovese, Trebbiano, Pagadebit, Rebola, Cabernet Sauvignon and Albana, a dessert wine of Roman origins.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nRimini has a rich historical and artistic heritage, which includes churches and monasteries, villas and palaces, fortifications, archaeological sites, streets and squares. This richness is the result of the succession of various civilizations, dominations and historical events through 22 centuries of history: the Romans, the Byzantines, the role of medieval comune and capital of the Malatesta seignory, the Venetian Republic and the Papal States dominations.\nThe city has always been a key gate to the Orient and the southern areas of the Mediterranean, thanks to its geographical position and the importance of its harbour, and a meeting point between cultures of Northern and Central Italy.\nRimini has monuments of all epochs, with important examples of architecture from the Roman age, such as the Arch of Augustus, the Tiberius Bridge, the Amphiteatre and the Domus del Chirurgo; from the Middle Ages, such as the Palazzo dell'Arengo, the church of Sant'Agostino and Castel Sismondo; from the Renaissance, with the Tempio Malatestiano, masterpiece of Leon Battista Alberti.Rimini's archaeological heritage includes various domus of Republican and Imperial age, characterized by polychrome or black and white mosaics, necropolis and sections of the pavement of the ancient Roman streets.\nThe city, along with its boroughs and the seaside district of Marina Centro, also preserves a wide architectural heritage from the Baroque, the Neoclassical and Art Nouveau periods, with churches, palaces, hotels and mansions, which reveal its role of cultural, political, trading centre and famous seaside resort.\nThe city has a Roman structure, partly modified by following medieval transformations. A continuous evolution, through the urban renovation of the Malatesta, earthquakes, the suppressions of monasteries, has led to a peculiar stratification of historic sites and buildings. The bombings of World War II destroyed the city almost completely, compromising the monumental heritage and the integrity of the city centre, which has been reconstructed and restored in order to valorize its historic places and its numerous fine buildings.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Main sights ===\n\n\n==== Religious buildings ====\nTempio Malatestiano: The original gothic-style cathedral of San Francesco was built in the 13th century, but reconstructed into a Renaissance masterwork by the Florentine architect Leon Battista Alberti, commissioned by Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, hence the name.

Many projects were started to restore it; it reopened in 2019.\nVilla Des Vergers: It is the largest and most famous riminese villa, situated on the hills of San Lorenzo in Correggiano, about 6 km from the city centre. The villa was built in the 17th century for want of the Diotallevi family; in 1843 it was purchased by French historian and archaeologist Adolphe No\u00ebl des Vergers and entirely renovated between 1880 and 1890 by architect Arthur-Stanislas Diet. The palace is a typical example of Napoleon III Eclectic architecture, with a main building fronted by a pronaos and flanked by two lateral wings, and internal halls characterized by Neoclassical furnitures and decorations. The villa is surrounded by a 6 hectares park, which includes a water parterre, a formal giardino all'italiana and a landscape garden, with groups of evergreen oaks, pines and cypresses which frame the palace in scenographic perspectives.\n\n\n==== Monuments ====\nArch of Augustus: This arch built in 27 BC has a single gate 9.92 metres (33 ft) high and 8.45 metres (28 ft) wide.

The bridge still connects the city centre to Borgo San Giuliano and leads to the consular roads Via Emilia and Via Popilia that lead north. Built in Istria stone, the bridge consists of five arches that rest on massive pillars with breakwater spurs set at an oblique angle with respect to the bridge's axis in order to follow the current. The bridge's structure, on the other hand, rests on a practical system of wooden poles.\nTorre dell'Orologio: The Clock tower was built in 1547 in Piazza Tre Martiri, replacing the ancient \"beccherie\" (public butcher's), and reconstructed in 1759 by Giovan Francesco Buonamici. In 1875, the top of the tower was ruined due to an earthquake, and it was restored in 1933. The clock, which dates back to 1562, overlooks a perpetual calendar assembled in 1750, decorated by terracotta panels depicting zodiacal signs, months and lunar phases. The central, blind arch of the porch houses the memorial of the victims of World War II.\n\n\n==== Archaeological sites ====\nRoman amphitheater (2nd century): The amphitheater was erected alongside the ancient coast line, and had two orders of porticoes with 60 arcades. It had elliptical shape, with axes of 117.7 by 88 metres (386 by 289 ft).

        "wiki": "San Marino ( (listen), Italian: [sam ma\u02c8ri\u02d0no]), officially the Republic of San Marino (Italian: Repubblica di San Marino; Romagnol: Rip\u00f3bblica d' San Marein), also known as the Most Serene Republic of San Marino (Italian: Serenissima Repubblica di San Marino), is a microstate in Southern Europe completely enclosed by Italy.Located on the northeastern side of the Apennine Mountains, San Marino covers a land area of just over 61 km2 (24 sq mi), and has a population of 33,562. Its capital is the City of San Marino and its largest settlement is Dogana. San Marino's official language is Italian.\nThe country derives its name from Saint Marinus, a stonemason from the then Roman island of Rab, in modern-day Croatia. Born in AD 275, Marinus participated in the reconstruction of Rimini's city walls after their destruction by Liburnian pirates. Marinus then went on to find an independent monastic community on Monte Titano in AD 301; thus, San Marino lays claim to being the oldest extant sovereign state, as well as the oldest constitutional republic.San Marino's politics are ruled by its constitution, which dictates that every six months San Marino's parliament must elect two Captains Regent. The Captain Regents have equal powers, and are free to exercise them within the limits of the constitution and parliamentary legislation until their term expires.\nThe country's economy is mainly based on finance, industry, services and tourism. It is one of the wealthiest countries in the world in terms of GDP per capita, with a figure comparable to the most developed European regions. San Marino is considered to have a highly stable economy, with one of the lowest unemployment rates in Europe, no national debt and a budget surplus.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSaint Marinus left the island of Rab in present-day Croatia with his lifelong friend Leo, and went to the city of Rimini as a stonemason. After the Diocletianic Persecution following his Christian sermons, he escaped to the nearby Monte Titano, where he built a small church and thus founded what is now the city and state of San Marino.\nThe official founding date is 3 September 301. In 1320 the community of Chiesanuova chose to join the country. In 1463 San Marino was extended with the communities of Faetano, Fiorentino, Montegiardino, and Serravalle, after which the country's borders have remained unchanged.In 1503, Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander VI occupied the Republic for six months until his father's successor, Pope Julius II, intervened and restored the country's independence.On June 4, 1543 Fabiano di Monte San Savino, nephew of the later Pope Julius III, attempted to conquer the republic, but his infantry and cavalry failed as they got lost in a dense fog, which the Sammarinese attributed to Saint Quirinus, whose feast day it was.After the Duchy of Urbino was annexed by the Papal States in 1625, San Marino became an enclave within the Papal States, something which led to its seeking the formal protection of the Papal States in 1631, but this never equalled a de facto Papal control of the republic.The country was occupied on October 17, 1739 by the legate (Papal governor) of Ravenna, Cardinal Giulio Alberoni, but the independence was restored by Pope Clement XII on February 5, 1740, the feast day of Saint Agatha, after which she became a patron saint of the republic.The advance of Napoleon's army in 1797 presented a brief threat to the independence of San Marino, but the country was saved from losing its liberty thanks to one of its regents, Antonio Onofri, who managed to gain the respect and friendship of Napoleon. Thanks to his intervention, Napoleon, in a letter delivered to Gaspard Monge, scientist and commissary of the French Government for Science and Art, promised to guarantee and protect the independence of the Republic, even offering to extend its territory according to its needs. The offer was declined by the regents, fearing future retaliation from other states' revanchism.\n\nDuring the later phase of the Italian unification process in the 19th century, San Marino served as a refuge for many people persecuted because of their support for unification, including Giuseppe Garibaldi and his wife Anita.\nThe government of San Marino made United States President Abraham Lincoln an honorary citizen. He wrote in reply, saying that the republic proved that \"government founded on republican principles is capable of being so administered as to be secure and enduring.\"During World War I, when Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915, San Marino remained neutral and Italy adopted a hostile view of Sammarinese neutrality, suspecting that San Marino could harbour Austrian spies who could be given access to its new radiotelegraph station. Italy tried to forcibly establish a detachment of Carabinieri in the republic and then cut the republic's telephone lines when it did not comply. Two groups of ten volunteers joined Italian forces in the fighting on the Italian front, the first as combatants and the second as a medical corps operating a Red Cross field hospital. The existence of this hospital later caused Austria-Hungary to suspend diplomatic relations with San Marino.After the war, San Marino suffered from high rates of unemployment and inflation, leading to increased tensions between the lower and middle classes. The latter, fearing that the moderate government of San Marino would make concessions to the lower class majority, began to show support for the Sammarinese Fascist Party (Partito Fascista Sammarinese, PFS), founded in 1922 and styled largely on their Italian counterpart. PFS rule lasted from 1923 to 1943, and during this time they often sought support from Benito Mussolini's fascist government in Italy.\n\nDuring World War II, San Marino remained neutral, although it was wrongly reported in an article from The New York Times that it had declared war on the United Kingdom on 17 September 1940. The Sammarinese government later transmitted a message to the British government stating that they had not declared war on the United Kingdom.Three days after the fall of Benito Mussolini in Italy, PFS rule collapsed and the new government declared neutrality in the conflict. The Fascists regained power on 1 April 1944 but kept neutrality intact. Despite that, on 26 June 1944, San Marino was bombed by the Royal Air Force, in the belief that San Marino had been overrun by German forces and was being used to amass stores and ammunition. The Sammarinese government declared on the same day that no military installations or equipment were located on its territory, and that no belligerent forces had been allowed to enter. San Marino accepted thousands of civilian refugees when Allied forces went over the Gothic Line. In September 1944, it was briefly occupied by German forces, who were defeated by Allied forces in the Battle of San Marino.\nSan Marino had the world's first democratically elected communist government \u2013 a coalition between the Sammarinese Communist Party and the Sammarinese Socialist Party, which held office between 1945 and 1957.San Marino is the world's smallest republic, although when Nauru gained independence in 1968 it challenged that claim, Nauru's land mass being only 21 km2 (8.1 sq mi). However Nauru's jurisdiction over its surrounding waters covers 431,000 km2 (166,000 sq mi), an area thousands of times greater than the territory of San Marino. San Marino became a member of the Council of Europe in 1988 and of the United Nations in 1992. It is neither a member of the European Union nor of the Eurozone, although it uses the euro as its currency.\nDuring the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic, as of June 2020, San Marino had the highest death rate per capita of any country.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSan Marino is an enclave (landlocked) surrounded by Italy in Southern Europe, on the border between the regions of Emilia Romagna and Marche and about 10 km (6.21 mi) from the Adriatic coast at Rimini. Its hilly topography, with no flat ground, is part of the Apennine mountain range. The highest point in the country, the summit of Monte Titano, is 749 m (2,457 ft) above sea level. San Marino has no still or contained bodies of water of any significant size.\nIt is one of only three countries in the world to be completely enclosed by another country (the others being Vatican City, also enclosed by Italy, and Lesotho, enclosed by South Africa). It is the third smallest country in Europe, after Vatican City and Monaco, and the fifth smallest country in the world.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of San Marino is a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa), with continental influences, having warm summers and cool winters that are typical of inland areas of the central Italian peninsula. Snowfalls are common and heavy almost every winter, especially above 400\u2013500 m of altitude.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nSan Marino has the political framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic: the captains regent are both heads of state and heads of government, and there is a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Grand and General Council. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.\nSan Marino is considered to have the earliest written governing documents still in effect, as the Statues of 1600 are still at the core of its constitutional framework.San Marino was originally led by the Arengo, initially formed from the heads of each family. In the 13th century, power was given to the Grand and General Council. In 1243, the first two captains regent were nominated by the Council. Still today, Captains Regent are elected every six months by the Council.\nThe legislature of the republic is the Grand and General Council (Consiglio grande e generale). The Council is a unicameral legislature with 60 members. There are elections every five years by proportional representation in all nine administrative districts. These districts (townships) correspond to the old parishes of the republic. All citizens 18 years or older are eligible to vote.\nBesides general legislation, the Grand and General Council approves the budget and elects the captains regent, the State Congress (composed of ten secretaries with executive power), the Council of Twelve (which forms the judicial branch during the period of legislature of the Council), the Advising Commissions, and the Government Unions. The council also has the power to ratify treaties with other countries. The council is divided into five different Advising Commissions consisting of fifteen councilors who examine, propose, and discuss the implementation of new laws that are on their way to being presented on the floor of the council.\nEvery six months, the council elects two captains regents to be the heads of state. The regents are chosen from opposing parties so that there is a balance of power. They serve a six-month term. The investiture of the captains regent takes place on 1 April and 1 October in every year. Once this term is over, citizens have three days in which to file complaints about the captains' activities. If they warrant it, judicial proceedings against the ex-head(s) of state can be initiated.\nThe practice of having two heads of state, like Roman consuls, chosen in frequent elections, is derived directly from the customs of the Roman Republic. The Council is equivalent to the Roman Senate; the captains regent, to the consuls of ancient Rome. It is thought the inhabitants of the area came together as Roman rule collapsed to form a rudimentary government for their own protection from foreign rule.\nSan Marino is a multi-party democratic republic. A new election law in 2008 raised the threshold for small parties entering Parliament, causing political parties to organise themselves into two alliances: the right-wing Pact for San Marino, led by the San Marinese Christian Democratic Party; and the left-wing Reforms and Freedom, led by the Party of Socialists and Democrats, a merger of the Socialist Party of San Marino and the former communist Party of Democrats. The 2008 general election was won by the Pact for San Marino with 35 seats in the Grand and General Council against Reforms and Freedom's 25.\nOn 1 October 2007, Mirko Tomassoni was elected as among the heads of state, making him the first disabled person ever to have been elected as captain regent.San Marino has had more female heads of state than any other country: 15 as of October 2014, including three who served twice. With regard to the legal profession, while the Order of Lawyers and Notaries of the Republic of San Marino [Ordine degli Avvocati e Notai della Repubblica di San Marino] exists, there is no clear indication as to how demographic groups have fared in the legal field.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\n\n==== Municipalities ====\n\nSan Marino is divided into the following nine municipalities, known locally as castelli (meaning \"castles\"):\n\nSan Marino (City of San Marino, officially Citt\u00e0 di San Marino) is the capital.There are also eight minor municipalities:\n\nAcquaviva\nBorgo Maggiore\nChiesanuova\nDomagnano\nFaetano\nFiorentino\nMontegiardino\nSerravalleThe largest settlement of the Republic is Dogana, which is not an autonomous castello, but rather belongs to the Castello of Serravalle.\nIn a similar way to an Italian comune, each castello includes a main settlement, called capoluogo, which is the seat of the castello, and some even smaller localities known as frazioni.\n\n\n==== Curacies ====\nThe republic is made up of 43 parishes named curacies (It: curazie):C\u00e0 Berlone, C\u00e0 Chiavello, C\u00e0 Giannino, C\u00e0 Melone, C\u00e0 Ragni, C\u00e0 Rigo, Cailungo, Caladino, Calligaria, Canepa, Capanne, Casole, Castellaro, Cerbaiola, Cinque Vie, Confine, Corianino, Crociale, Dogana, Falciano, Fiorina, Galavotto, Gualdicciolo, La Serra, Lesignano, Molarini, Montalbo, Monte Pulito, Murata, Pianacci, Piandivello, Poggio Casalino, Poggio Chiesanuova, Ponte Mellini, Rovereta, San Giovanni sotto le Penne, Santa Mustiola, Spaccio Giannoni, Teglio, Torraccia, Valdragone, Valgiurata and Ventoso.\n\n\n=== Military ===\n\nSan Marino's military forces are among the smallest in the world. National defence is, by arrangement, the responsibility of Italy's armed forces. Different branches have varied functions, including: performing ceremonial duties; patrolling borders; mounting guard at government buildings; and assisting police in major criminal cases. The police are not included in the military of San Marino.\n\n\n==== Crossbow Corps ====\nOnce at the heart of San Marino's army, the Crossbow Corps is now a ceremonial force of approximately 80 volunteers. Since 1295, the Crossbow Corps has provided demonstrations of crossbow shooting at festivals. Its uniform design is medieval. While still a statutory military unit, the Crossbow Corps has no military function today.\n\n\n==== Guard of the Rock ====\n\nThe Guard of the Rock is a front-line military unit in the San Marino armed forces, a state border patrol, with responsibility for patrolling borders and defending them. In their role as Fortress Guards they are responsible for guarding the Palazzo Pubblico in San Marino City, the seat of national government.\nIn this role they are the forces most visible to tourists, and are known for their colourful ceremony of Changing the Guard. Under the 1987 statute the Guard of the Rock are all enrolled as \"Criminal Police Officers\" (in addition to their military role) and assist the police in investigating major crime. The uniform of the Guard of the Rock is a distinctive red and green.\n\n\n==== Guard of the Grand and General Council ====\nThe Guard of the Grand and General Council commonly known as The Guard of the Council or locally as the \"Guard of Nobles\", formed in 1741, is a volunteer unit with ceremonial duties. Due to its striking blue, white, and gold uniform, it is perhaps the best-known part of the Sammarinese military, and appears on countless postcard views of the republic. The functions of the Guard of the Council are to protect the captains regent, and to defend the Grand and General Council during its formal sessions. They also act as ceremonial bodyguards to government officials at both state and church festivals.\n\n\n==== Company of Uniformed Militia ====\nIn former times, all families with two or more adult male members were required to enroll half of them in the Company of Uniformed Militia. This unit remains the basic fighting force of the armed forces of San Marino, but is largely ceremonial. It is a matter of civic pride for many Sammarinese to belong to the force, and all citizens with at least six years residence in the republic are entitled to enroll.\nThe uniform is dark blue, with a kepi bearing a blue and white plume. The ceremonial form of the uniform includes a white cross-strap, and white and blue sash, white epaulets, and white decorated cuffs.\n\n\n==== Military Ensemble ====\nFormally this is part of the Army Militia, and is the ceremonial military band of San Marino. It consists of approximately 60 musicians. The uniform is similar to that of the Army Militia. Military Ensemble music accompanies most state occasions in the republic.\n\n\n==== Gendarmerie ====\nEstablished in 1842, the Gendarmerie of San Marino is a militarised law enforcement agency. Its members are full-time and have responsibility for the protection of citizens and property, and the preservation of law and order.\nThe entire military corps of San Marino depends upon the co-operation of full-time forces and their retained (volunteer) colleagues, known as the Corpi Militari Volontari, or Voluntary Military Force.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nSan Marino is a developed country and although it is not a European Union member, it is allowed to use the euro as its currency by arrangement with the Council of the European Union; it is also granted the right to use its own designs on the national side of the euro coins. Before the euro, the Sammarinese lira was pegged to, and exchangeable with, the Italian lira. The small number of Sammarinese euro coins, as was the case with the lira before it, are primarily of interest to coin collectors.\nSan Marino's per capita GDP and standard of living are comparable to that of Italy. Key industries include banking, electronics, and ceramics. The main agricultural products are wine and cheese. San Marino imports mainly staple goods from Italy.\nSan Marino's postage stamps, which are valid for mail posted in the country, are mostly sold to philatelists and are an important source of income. San Marino is no longer a member of the Small European Postal Administration Cooperation.It has the world's highest rate of car ownership, being the only country with more vehicles than people.\n\n\n=== Taxation ===\nThe corporate profits tax rate in San Marino is 17%, capital gains are subject to a five per cent tax, and active interest is subject to a 11% withholding tax. Several benefits apply to new businesses, which can strongly reduced the amount of taxes to be paid.\nThe personal income tax (IGR, Italian: Imposta Generale sui Redditi) was introduced in 1984 and it was heavily reformed in 2013 with the goal of increasing fiscal revenue. The nominal tax rate ranges from 9% for an annual revenue below \u20ac10,000 to 35% for revenues above \u20ac80,000.\nIn 1972, a value-added tax (VAT) system was introduced in Italy, and an equivalent tax was introduced also in San Marino, in accordance with the 1939 friendship treaty. However, this tax is not a standard value-added tax, but rather it is an import tax, thus, it is levied only on imported goods and raw resources. For this reason it is locally best known as single stage tax (Italian: imposta monofase), as it is only applied one time during importation, while VAT is applied at every exchange. Furthermore, while VAT also applies to services, the import tax only applies on physical goods. Another important difference is that while VAT is computed on the final price paid by the consumer, the import tax is levied on the importation cost paid by the company, which is generally much lower.\nUnder the European Union customs agreement, San Marino import tax is considered equivalent to the European VAT system. A separate tax on services, with a rate of 3%, has been introduced in 2011. The introduction of a true VAT system, not dissimilar from the European one, is under development.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nThe tourism sector contributes over 22% of San Marino's GDP, with approximately 2 million tourists having visited in 2014.\n\n\n=== Conventions with Italy ===\nSan Marino and Italy have engaged in conventions since 1862, dictating some economic activities in San Marino's territory.\nCultivation of tobacco and production of goods which are subject to Italy's government monopoly are forbidden in San Marino. Direct import is forbidden; all goods coming from a third party have to travel through Italy before reaching the country. Although it is allowed to print its own postal stamps, San Marino is not allowed to coin its own currency and is obliged to use Italy's mint; the agreement does not affect the right of the Republic of San Marino to continue to issue gold coins denominated in Scudi (legal value of 1 gold Scudo is 37.50 euros). Gambling is legal and regulated; however, casinos were outlawed prior to 2007. There is currently one legally operating casino.\nIn exchange for these limitations, Italy provides San Marino with an annual stipend, and at cost, sea salt (not more than 250 tonnes per year), tobacco (40 tonnes), cigarettes (20 tonnes) and matches (unlimited amount).At the border there are no formalities with Italy. However, at the tourist office visitors can purchase officially cancelled souvenir stamps for their passports.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\n\nSan Marino has a population of approximately 33,000, with 4,800 foreign residents, most of whom are Italian citizens. Another 12,000 Sammarinese live abroad (5,700 in Italy, 3,000 in the US, 1,900 in France and 1,600 in Argentina).\nThe first census since 1976 was conducted in 2010. Results were expected by the end of 2011; however, 13% of families did not return their forms.\nThe primary language spoken is Italian; Romagnol is also widely spoken.\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\nGiovanni Battista Belluzzi (1506 in San Marino \u2013 1554) an architect\nFrancesco Maria Marini (di Pesaro) (1630\u20131686), a composer, playwright, and Catholic archbishop\nAntonio Onofri (1759-1825), statesman, \"Father of his Country.\"\nLittle Tony (1941\u20132013), a pop and rock musician\nPasquale Valentini (born 1953 in San Marino), a politician who has held multiple ministerial posts\nMassimo Bonini (born 1959 in San Marino), a football player who played for Juventus\nMarco Macina (born 30 September 1964 in San Marino), a footballer who played for Bologna FC, Parma, Reggiana and AC Milan.\nValentina Monetta (born 1 March 1975 in San Marino), a singer who represented San Marino four times in the Eurovision Song Contest\nSimone Pacini (born 1981 in San Marino), a footballer who plays for local club Folgore as a midfielder\nManuel Poggiali (born 1983 in San Marino), a Grand Prix motorcycle road racing World Champion\nAlex De Angelis (born 1984 in Rimini), a Grand Prix motorcycle road racer\nDavide Simoncini (born 30 August 1986 in San Marino), a footballer who plays as a defender for San Marino club A.C.

Approximately half of those who profess to be Catholic practice the faith. There is no episcopal see in San Marino, although its name is part of the present diocesan title. Historically, the various parishes in San Marino were divided between two Italian dioceses, mostly in the Diocese of Montefeltro, and partly in the Diocese of Rimini. In 1977, the border between Montefeltro and Rimini was readjusted so that all of San Marino fell within the diocese of Montefeltro. The bishop of Montefeltro-San Marino resides in Pennabilli, in Italy's province of Pesaro e Urbino.\nThere is a provision under the income tax rules that the taxpayers have the right to request for allocation of 0.3% of their income tax to the Catholic Church or to charities. The churches include the two religious groups of the Waldensian Church and Jehovah's Witnesses.\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of San Marino-Montefeltro was until 1977 the historic diocese of Montefeltro. It is a suffragan of the archdiocese of Ravenna-Cervia. The current diocese includes all the parishes of San Marino. The earliest mention of Montefeltro, as Mona Feretri, is in the diplomas by which Charlemagne confirmed the donation of Pepin. The first known bishop of Montefeltro was Agatho (826), whose residence was at San Leo. Under Bishop Flaminios Dondi (1724) the see was again transferred to San Leo, but later it returned to Pennabilli. The historic diocese was a suffragan of the archdiocese of Urbino. Since 1988, there is formally an apostolic nunciature to the republic, but it is vested in the nuncio to Italy.\nThere has been a Jewish presence in San Marino for at least 600 years. The first mention of Jews in San Marino dates to the late 14th century, in official documents recording the business transactions of Jews. There are many documents throughout the 15th to 17th centuries describing Jewish dealings and verifying the presence of a Jewish community in San Marino. Jews were permitted official protection by the government.\nDuring World War II, San Marino provided a haven for more than 100,000 Italians and Jews (approximately 10 times the Sammarinese population at the time) from Nazi persecution. As of 2012, few Jews remain. In 2019 it has been inaugurated the 'Chapel of three religions', the first ever building of its kind devoted to interfaith dialogue.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nThere are 220 km (140 mi) of roads in the country, the main road being the San Marino Highway. Authorities license private vehicles with distinctive Sammarinese license plates, which are white with blue figures and the coat of arms, usually a letter followed by up to four numbers. Many vehicles also carry the international vehicle identification code (in black on a white oval sticker), which is \"RSM\".\nThere are no public airports in San Marino, but there is a small private airstrip located in Torraccia and an international heliport located in Borgo Maggiore. Most tourists who arrive by air land at Federico Fellini International Airport close to the city of Rimini, then make the transfer by bus.\nTwo rivers flow through San Marino, but there is no major water transport, and no port or harbour.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nSan Marino has limited public transport facilities. There is a regular bus service between Rimini and the city of San Marino that is popular with both tourists and workers commuting to San Marino from Italy. This service stops at approximately 20 locations in Rimini and within San Marino, with its two terminus stops at Rimini railway station and San Marino coach station.\nA limited licensed taxi service operates nationwide. There are seven licensed taxi companies operating in the republic, and Italian taxis regularly operate within San Marino when carrying passengers picked up in Italian territory.\n\nThere is a 1.5 km (0.93 mi) aerial tramway connecting the City of San Marino on top of Monte Titano with Borgo Maggiore, a major town in the republic, with the second largest population of any Sammarinese settlement. From here a further connection is available to the nation's largest settlement, Dogana, via the local bus service.\nTwo aerial tramway cars (gondolas) operate, with service provided at roughly 15-minute intervals throughout the day. A third vehicle is available on the system, a service car for the use of engineers maintaining the tramway.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\n\nToday, there is no railway in San Marino, but for a short period before World War II, it had a single narrow-gauge line called the Ferrovia Rimini\u2013San Marino which connected the country with the Italian rail network at Rimini. Because of the difficulties in accessing the capital, City of San Marino, with its mountain-top location, the terminus station was planned to be located in the village of Valdragone, but was extended to reach the capital through a steep and winding track comprising many tunnels. The railway was opened on 12 June 1932.\nAn advanced system for its time, it was an electric railway, powered from overhead cables. It was well built and had a high frequency of passengers, but was almost completely destroyed during World War II. Many facilities such as bridges, tunnels, and stations remain visible today, and some have been converted to parks, public footpaths, or traffic routes.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe Three Towers of San Marino are located on the three peaks of Monte Titano in the capital. They are depicted on both the flag of San Marino and its coat of arms. The three towers are: Guaita, the oldest of the three (it was constructed in the 11th century); the 13th-century Cesta, located on the highest of Monte Titano's summits; and the 14th-century Montale, on the smallest of Monte Titano's summits, still privately owned.\n\n\n=== University ===\nThe Universit\u00e0 degli Studi della Repubblica di San Marino (University of the Republic of San Marino) is the main university, which includes the Scuola Superiore di Studi Storici di San Marino (Graduate School of Historical Studies), a distinguished research and advanced international study centre governed by an international Scientific Committee coordinated by the emeritus historian Luciano Canfora. Other important institutes are the Istituto Musicale Sammarinese (Sammarinese Musical Institute) and the Akademio Internacia de la Sciencoj San Marino or Accademia Internazionale delle Scienze San Marino (International Academy of Sciences San Marino). The latter is known for adopting Esperanto as the language for teaching and for scientific publications; further, it makes wide use of electronic educational technology (also called e-learning).\nItalian author Umberto Eco had attempted to create a \"university without physical structures\" in San Marino.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nIn San Marino football is the most popular sport. Basketball and volleyball are also popular. The three sports have their own federations, the San Marino Football Federation, the San Marino Basketball Federation and the San Marino Volleyball Federation.\nThe San Marino national football team has had little success, being made up of part-timers, never qualifying for a major tournament, and recording only one win in over 25 years of its history, a 1\u20130 victory in 2004 against Liechtenstein. They have drawn four more, with their most notable result being a 1993 0\u20130 draw with Turkey during the European qualifiers for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. In the same qualifying competition Davide Gualtieri scored a goal 8.3 seconds into a match against England; this goal held the record for the fastest in international football until 2016.\n\nA Formula One race, the San Marino Grand Prix, was named after the state, although it did not take place there. Instead, it was held at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in the Italian town of Imola, about 100 km (60 mi) northwest of San Marino. Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna suffered fatal accidents a day apart during the 1994 Grand Prix. This international event was removed from the calendar in 2007.\nThe San Marino and Rimini's Coast motorcycle Grand Prix was reinstated in the schedule in 2007 and takes place at the Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli, as does San Marino's round of the World Superbike Championship.\nSan Marino has a professional baseball team which plays in Italy's top division. It has participated in the European Cup tournament for the continent's top club sides several times, hosting the event in 1996, 2000, 2004, and 2007. It won the championship in 2006 and was a runner-up in 2010.Together with Italy, San Marino held the 2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, with teams playing at the Stadio Olimpico in Serravalle.\nSan Marino has had little success at the Olympic Games, winning no medals.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nThe cuisine of San Marino is extremely similar to Italian, especially that of the adjoining Emilia-Romagna and Marche regions, but it has a number of its own unique dishes and products. Its best known is probably the Torta Tre Monti (\"Cake of the Three Mountains\" or \"Cake of the Three Towers\"), a wafer layered cake covered in chocolate depicting the Three Towers of San Marino. The country also has a small wine industry.\n\n\n=== UNESCO ===\nThe site San Marino: Historic Centre and Mount Titano became part of the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2008. The decision was taken during the 32nd Session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee composed of 21 Countries convened in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nThe country has a long and rich musical tradition, closely linked to that of Italy, but which is also highly independent in itself. A well-known 17th-century composer is Francesco Maria Marini. The pop singer Little Tony achieved considerable success in the United Kingdom and Italy in the 1950s and 1960s.\nSan Marino has taken part in the Eurovision Song Contest ten times, achieving two final qualifications to date (with then-three, eventually four-time contestant and San Marino native Valentina Monetta with \"Maybe\" in 2014 and Turkish singer Serhat with \"Say Na Na Na\" who achieved 19th place in the final in 2019).\n\n\n=== Public holidays and festivals ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAssociazione Guide Esploratori Cattolici Sammarinesi\nCity-state\nIndex of San Marino\u2013related articles\nOutline of San Marino\nPostage stamps and postal history of San Marino\nTelecommunications in San Marino\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Geographic data related to San Marino at OpenStreetMap\nSan Marino at Curlie\n Wikimedia Atlas of San Marino",

          "A lot of miniatures from different cities in Italy, a ride through Venice and a giant feeling :). I took pictures of the ones I want to visit. Improvements needed: Audio guide they say it is broken, I have seen this issue in other places in San Marino also. Some miniature",
          "A nice entertainement Park, among the oldest in Romagna . Replica Of italian boot with playgrounds and water games to enjoy even in a hot summer . Our children liked a lot the water cannon and the water truck games . Worthy up to 10-11 years .",
          "This attraction near Rimini is a decent distraction if in the area. We arrived early and made our way around the park before the crowds set in. The actual models are very well done and while it\u2019s not enthralling, it is interesting. The entry fee of 23\u20ac also includes most of the",
          "Outside Rimini, by buss ~30 min. Kids (6 and 14 y.o.) loved it as well as adults. 4 hours is max for walking around inside. Buy tickets in the official information centers or online.",
          "A very beautiful place clean and nice! It is a bit expensive but we didnt regret going! The bad thing is that after we pay 69 euro for 3 person we had to pay appart the parking :/",
          "We've been with the family and we all enjoyed it! It's extremely well made! The only thing missing is the Gran Sasso which personally I would have liked to see since it's the highest chain in the Apennines. There are play areas for young children which is very good and trip into",
          "It was nice to learn more about most famous places in Italy. I think it is perfect for children and families, because there is lot to do and see. But the ticket price was really high - 23 euros. But it was nice that it was possible to register the ticket and it means that next",
          "This park is well worth a visit for children between 4-12.The models are very realistic and you feel like you really are in all the sites .Very good rides as well including a good water slide, monorail and boat ride in Venice. Europe in miniature is worth a visit as well.",
          "Lovely place, interesting for adults, and particularly amusing for kids... Models are very authentic.",
          "I'd rather spend my money at the bar then visit this relic from the 50's! the place hasn't had any renovations done in 60 years.",
          "Good way to entertain family. Combo tickits with other parks are pfva great value Keep in mind that you can use those to enter the park two days",
          "We really enjoyed our day in this park. Our three children age 7-10 and 12 loved this place. Rides, fun and Italy all in one place. You can bring your snacks and drinks. You can also use your ticket twice :)",
          "Nice place to visit, though it was much too hot under the sun when we went there. I agree with whoever said to visit it in the evening! The models are nice, but some of them need repairs. Our 5.5yo was very happy there. We only took a couple hours to go around it.",
          "It is a great place for having fun with little children.Our son is 5 years old and he had fun on each attraction in the park.The only one problem we had was reaching the park.We travelled with a bus -number 4 and after that we have to walk about 2 kilometers.",
          "There are many reviews of this place but I had to say that I had a great time here, as probably all the other guests. There are miniatures of different places from the entire Italy, so that if you visited the places you have the occasion to remember your trips or you can",
          "The park was a highly recommended spot during our stay. We have two young children, ages 5 and 3. We did the whole park in less than 3 hours. The few rides were perfect for their age group. They loved the small displays of landmarks and pushing the buttons to interact with them.",
          "Nice little 2-3 hours max if you want something different. A good round up of miniature buildings from Italy and a few from Europe. There are also a number of activities for little ones. I would recommend the McDonald's for lunch as there are only two small options in the park",
          "Great oportunity to visit all the Italy in just one day. Very interesant attraction park and the details are just unbeliveable. This place is very suitable for family with children. You will have a lot of free atractions for children.",
          "We spent almost all day walking around the impressive miniatures. Literally, every important landmark. The details are just unbelievable!",
          "The idea is perfect, but the place is starting to be dated. Some of the things didn't work at all and some were just worn out. Also the ticket prices are quite high. If you don't have anything else to do, this is maybe worth visit.",
          "Very nice attraction park....buildings are so detailed..beautiful..lots of things to do beside seing the miniature buildings...nice place to spend time",
          "It was a very good decision to go to Italiy in Miniature beacuse it's a very beautiful theme park and it s a pleasure to walk by all the important attraction in Italy( Colloseum, The Pisa Tower, The Alps, Etna,Vatican, etc.) They have a special tour for Venice in miniature which",
          "I have been several times to this attraction and it is beginning to look dated. Several attractions were not open at the same time as the park and the monorail was closed for maintenance, although no one appeared to be working on it. Some of the doors in the Italian Piazza were",
          "This place was more interesting than we expected. Huge number of mini copies of buildings across whole Italy, and each of them made with high level of detalisation. If You make photo of some building without other objects in the frame (signs, people, fence etc) - it will be",
          "The park itself is a nice idea and gives you a good overview of the most important buildings in Italy. It's a bit aging though and not too well mantained. What bothered me the most though, was that the surrounding fun activities stop working one full hour before the park closes.",
          "Very interesting and funny place. Price is so higher but it's a great experience. The place is suitable for families with children.",
          "Wow what a wonderful place.very nice to see all the small builldings of italy. A nice park.it Will take about 2 hours to see the all builldings and you want to see more, And you wont to leave.Very beautyful place.will recomended IT to freinds .",
          "A nice little place to visit, perhaps a little dated but still good to see all the buildings of Italy. Went with my two teenage boys, they enjoyed Ferrari simulator (the one at the museum was 5 times more expensive) and water fight. Loved the Venice boat ride and the water",
          "This is a nice little park. All you really need is maybe 2hrs and you would have seen and done everything.... Twice. With the purchase of the initial entrance fee, you can go take a picture and come back for free for the rest of the year. If you live in Rimini, I guess it's a",
          "We can imagine that with little childeren this park is fantastic however with teenagers it is wasted time and especially money! \u20ac22,00 a person is also with little childeren to much...",
          "We visited this park during the journey from Senigallia to Cecina by chance -:). Our navigation worked bad and we left highway in Rimini. There were not many people at 11 a.m. Tickets cost 88 Euro for four person. It was interesting to look buildings which I really visited last",
          "Not every city but those in there are very well done even in small details. Italy is great! I enjoyed also the Europe side and my daughter loved Pinocchio live story with a round trip in train! The castle for water wars is funny and the exotic birds side as well. I would love",
          "Italiaans in miniatuur is a lovely outing. You can see where you've been before in Italy or where you wish to go to. It's a very nice set up, bit a bit pricy.",
          "Good bits - plenty of scale monuments to see, makes you want to visit more of the country, free boat trip around a staged Venice, plenty to do for kids and if you swap your entrance ticket for a photo pass you get an unlimited annual pass. Bad bits - lots of activities not",
          "Good for kids too....there are lot's of other attractions besides the model of Italian monuments. There is a lovely gondola ride that takes you through a \"fake\" Venice, car driving races and more.",
          "Nice and unique place ,I think, in Italy. You can watch all the most important Monuments in the Italian cities. You really can feel to be there yourself. max.",
          "Catch the bus number 8 from the station and this drops you right outside the gates. Your entrance fee is valid all season but don't forget to convert your tickets to a photo pass at the information centre. Great to have a wonder and some good exhibits, don't miss the Venice",
          "Well..it Was a little of disappointing cus we really expecte it to be grandeur and all but when we arrive there after 5 hours of travel by car thru traffic and stuff ..what was inside was not worth 22 euros..it's was really a pluff!!! They did not maintained the miniatures in",
          "A great introduction to the beautiful structures of Italy. I loved the boat ride in mini Venice. The miniatures are really mini, unlike the 'windows of the world' in China. So they are really great for kids to see from their eye level.",
          "This is must see, I would love to go back if I could. The place is wonderful and all miniature architecture is so accurate. This is defiantly a must do and must see",
          "I liked the park although for small children the miniatures are not really interesting but the amusement park. I believe if you really want to enjoy you go without children or if you go with children you simply miss the miniatures.",
          "We had looked forward to visit the park, but was disappointed! 22\u20ac to enter and it was nice but not too interesting. Many of the mini building and locations were well done, but only those we knew were possible to recognize as the location was only mention with the name of the",
          "Great amusement park near Rimini, within walking slowly for an hour by beautiful small streets surrounding area of Rimini. Tickets cost 22 euros in the summer, in the winter of 10 euros. But the park is worth the money - everything is beautiful, clean, lots of attractions, is",
          "I love see micro-men and micro-machines moving! but manteinance a bit poor... I will return with my children :)",
          "Very nice place to visit, but quite expensive and very crowded. Not a must see, except if you are traveling with kids, then it can be interesting to them.",
          "It was amazing to see Italy in Miniature. The park was not too big, the mini-version of Itlay was great to watch, and last but not the least the park had a lot of amusement for kids that was included in the price. It was a great fun for the whole family.",
          "Well, A trip to Italia in Miniatura is a must for all the family. Easily reachable. Just take bus No 8 from the main central station. Ticket only 1.5 Euros which is valid for 120 minutes. Don't forget to validate ticket on board This was a theatrical production depicting the",
          "Great way for kids to get a visual on Italy, where cities are located, and what monuments they can visit - grown ups too! Monday is family day so children get a discount on tickets. There are a couple of rides that are cute too, we went on the canoe ride, definitely low key",
          "We had a fun time walking around \"Italy\" - I loved that the miniature area was shaped like the country, so the miniatures are placed in the geographically correct place. The tags on the models would be more helpful for those not familiar with Italy if they would say more",
          "It was the penultimate day of our holiday and we decided to wing it, and get whatever bus turned up next. It was either going to be the Mall or Little Italy, Little Italy won and we lost. Usually on holiday I like to get the most out of every day, but since I'd made the",
          "Very cute and cool. I get to see all of Italy in one place!! Moving trains and interactive models make it even more enjoyable!!",
          "Great entertainment and also a lot of things to learn, from little children up to seniors. Beautiful floral choreography, good food. Spent the whole day and visiting all Italy! Great for all of us.",
          "it is tourist trap like the one in Barcelona. It is not worth time and money. better to spend the day in San Marino or at the beach.",
          "We popped in here as an afterthought on the way back from San Marino to Ravenna, and it was one of the best decisions we made while on holiday! Although entry is a touch on the expensive side, you could easily spend a whole day here with small children - particularly if they've",
          "I Regret visting the park for 3 reasons. First: the entry fee is absurdly expensive (22\u20ac each). Second: most of the monuments are not accurate in one way or another. Third: it was overcrowded and \"messed-up\". A place to carefully avoid!",
          "Being familiar with Madurodam in the Netherlands, the monuments in the park are well made and number around 200. The quality is however not consistent, in that some models are of much better quality and level of detail than others. That said, we came to the conclusion, there is",
          "Had a fab time at Italy in Miniature. Travelled there by the no.8 hourly-bus from Rimini train station. Quite a long journey about 45 mins - it is the last stop. Went on a Monday, as Mondays are \"family days\" and children get a reduction in entry fee from 16 euros to 6 euros",
          "To be honest, I didn't really want to go to a miniature park. We went there for the kids. But it is actually quite fun. The rides (although very limited) has absolutely no lines. We really really enjoy the Venice ride. The kids really like it too. Oh the water cannons",
          "Good to take into account if you're around. If you travel with kids, they will enjoy the small train and the amusements inside it. Also, there is a place where science is queen, for kids 10yrs+, that understand how things work. Venezia in miniatura is fun and really nice.",
          "I thought it's gonna be great to see Italy in Miniature, but unfortunately everything is more for little children than for adults. And the entry price is WAY TO EXPENSIVE!",
          "This is a well done attraction with plenty to do. The science fair was very educational, even for the adults. The only reason we rate it as three stars is because on the day we were there many things were not working, the monorail, the water cannons, the ballon ride, slingshot",
          "It is worth to visit this place. The ticket is 20-22 euro for all day but check at the reception at your hotel - can provide you a seasonal ticket or coupon, or a discount. Prepare a sun cream. It has many facilities and playgrounds for children. Buy a raincoat from the store",
          "we ought our tickets from our hotel as they were more reasonable . thought it would be all tatty small models well we were really pleased that indeed the building looked brilliant with fine details trains wizzing around and loads of cars and vans placed . the place in the mini",
          "It is worth to visit, but i suggest to consider there is not any tree or sunshade at all so there is terrible hot. Prepare with sun cream unless sunburn is sure. All in all it is a great fun especially for children but also in all age. I really enjoyed it. Getting there using",
          "We went to italia in miniatura while on holiday in igea (a seaside town nearby) last august. We went there with our 3 years and half son and thanks to a discount coupon from the hotel we bought a seasonal ticket. I think the park is not well focused, in that although the main",
          "Been there, it was interesting but i prefer to see reall structures instead of miniatures. But if you have kids, they will like it for sure!",
          "When you visit Rimini in ITALY you willfind it has beutiful squares and the dominant Clock Tower should not be missed . However, there are many other sites on the outsckirts of the city . Plenty of places to wine and dine at reasonable costs . If you like cities travel any time",
          "A lot to see. Most of the inside attractions included in the ticket price. Great combination with mulit-attraction ticket for dolphinarium & oceanarium.",
          "We reached it by \"Happy Bus\". Ticket for this bus is 3 \u20ac but if you have lunch or have something to drink or eat in bar or restaurant you can find in Italy in Miniature you have a discount for the cost of the bus ticket. It's interesting and amazing for children and their",
          "It's a funny attraction. We went there spontaneously in August 2010 and had some fun. You can see all the main Italian attractions in miniature and take a little boat tour through the canals of Venice. Also, they have one/two carousels that are fun if it's hot, which usually is",
          "Had mixed feelings about visiting this amusement park not far from Rimini, as its not really my kind of thing as such, it is difficult for me to compare it to other similar attractions. That said, it is cheaper than similar parks in the UK, The food, as one would expect, is far",
          "Although this park has some rides which are fun for children, it is mostly to visit the wonderful scale models of famous Italian buildings and places. My child was 7 years old when we went and she really wasn't interested in the models. She wanted to go on the rides. This being",
          "A lot of fun and attractions for both family and friends, i liked it. There are water slides, rope jumping, sightseeing of mini Italy and more",
          "Italia in miniatura is one of those understated places that sticks in your mind long after you've gone. Exact replicas of all the famous monuments in Italy and beyond, it offers you an entirely different perspective on your travels through Italy. In recent years they've added so",
          "We did have a real fun in this park and I would recommend it not only for families with children but also for adults. You need to plan at least 3 hours in the park. The entrance fee is a GOOD VALUE for what you get. Very interesting and rich of information. You get around the",
          "This little theme park reminded me of the kitschy American places of days gone by, such as storybook island, paul bunyan land, and the wisconsin dells. The mini replicas of italian and european landmarks are exquisite yet durable to exposure by the weather. The attentive",
          "you go inside and can visit many country and cities in the world",
          "Fun and culture for people of all ages: children, families, grown-up and young people, groups and scholl trips",
          "You can really get a taste of everything in Italy here, it is also good for collecting ideas about what to see in this country. Excellent reproductions, little Venice almost like the real one.",
          "20 euros for that? Better you spend your money in beers.. I was expecting detail of miniatures, I have got a patchwork of stratified development phases where you can see huge differences in detail, techniques and themes. The artificial grass in some points of the tour its ugly.",
          "The kids liked seeing all of the minauture. This is a fun place to see with the kids.",
          "Not cheap to get in, but offered a second day free (has to be the following day). Not much in the way of queues, but the rides were pretty basic - fine for our 5 year old, but pushing it to excite a 7 year old we'd guess. The miniature part of the attraction was of reasonable",
          "We visited Italia in Miniatura several times when our son was young. You walk all around the displays which are in the shape of Italy and see very life-like depictions of the Colosseum, the Leaning Tower etc.. There were rides for the smaller children as well as the usual food"

        "wiki": "The Gradara Castle is a medieval fortress that is located in the town of Gradara, Marche, in Italy.\nIt is protected by two walls, the outermost of which extends for almost 800 meters, making it the imposing structure. Particularly striking is the view of the fortress and the underlying historical village at night.\nThe castle is one of the most visited monuments in the region and is the scene of museum events, musical and artistic.\nGradara was, by geographical position, since ancient times a crossroads of traffic and people: during the Middle Ages the fortress was one of the main theaters of clashes between militias loyal to the papacy and the turbulent families Romagna and Marche.\nSituated at 142 metres above sea level, with the Republic of San Marino, Rimini and Carpegna in the background, Gradara represents an extraordinary urban and architectural combination. Legend has it that the castle was the scene of the famous and tragic love story of Paolo and Francesca, caught in each other's arms and killed by Gianciotto, Francesca's husband. This love story was immortalized by Dante in his Divine Comedy.\nThe Gradara Castle dates back to the period between 11th and 15th centuries. Its history is inextricably linked with the infamous feuds between the Malatesta and Montefeltro families. This long-standing conflict came to a halt only after the control of the castle fell into the hands of the Sforza family. It was Dante, however, who intervened with his Divine Comedy, making the castle the locale for the tale of Paolo and Francesca and thus turning the castle forever into a symbol of love.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Urbino (UK:  ur-BEE-noh, Italian: [ur\u02c8bi\u02d0no] (listen)) is a walled city in the Marche region of Italy, south-west of Pesaro, a World Heritage Site notable for a remarkable historical legacy of independent Renaissance culture, especially under the patronage of Federico da Montefeltro, duke of Urbino from 1444 to 1482. The town, nestled on a high sloping hillside, retains much of its picturesque medieval aspect. It hosts the University of Urbino, founded in 1506, and is the seat of the Archbishop of Urbino. Its best-known architectural piece is the Palazzo Ducale, rebuilt by Luciano Laurana.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe city is located in a predominantly hilly area, at the foothills of the Northern Apennines and the Tuscan-Romagnolo Apennines. The city is in the southern area of Montefeltro, an area classified as medium-high seismic risk. In the database of earthquakes developed by the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, nearly 65 seismic events have affected the town of Urbino between 26 March 1511 and 26 March 1998. They include 24 April 1741, when the shocks were stronger than VIII on the Mercalli intensity scale, with an epicenter in Fabriano (where it reached 6.08 on the moment magnitude scale).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins and Middle Ages ===\nThe modest Roman town of Urbinum Mataurense (\"the little city on the river Mataurus\") became an important strategic stronghold in the Gothic Wars of the 6th century, captured in 538 from the Ostrogoths by the Byzantine general Belisarius, and frequently mentioned by the historian Procopius.\nThough Pepin the Short (King of the Franks) presented Urbino to the Papacy in 754\u201356, independent traditions were expressed in its commune, until, around 1200, it came into the possession of the House of Montefeltro. Although these noblemen had no direct authority over the commune, they could pressure it to elect them to the position of podest\u00e0, a title that Bonconte di Montefeltro managed to obtain in 1213, with the result that Urbino's population rebelled and formed an alliance with the independent commune of Rimini (1228), finally regaining control of the town in 1234. Eventually, though, the Montefeltro noblemen took control once more, and held it until 1508. In the struggles between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, when factions supported either the Papacy or the Holy Roman Empire respectively, the 13th and 14th century Montefeltro lords of Urbino were leaders of the Ghibellines of the Marche and in the Romagna region.\n\n\n=== Period of Federico da Montefeltro ===\nThe most famous member of the Montefeltro family, Federico da Montefeltro, ruled as Duke of Urbino from 1444 to 1482. A very successful condottiere, a skillful diplomat and an enthusiastic patron of art and literature, he took over in 1444  as the son of Guidantonio, after a conspiracy and the murder of the legitimate Oddantonio, hated for his \"unbridled lust\" and for the excessive taxation exercised during his seventeen months in office.\nFederico set his hand to the political imperative and began a reorganization of the state, which also included a restructuring of the city according to a modern conception - comfortable, efficient and beautiful. Thanks to his efforts, for the nearly four decades of his rule the government aimed at this purpose, and thanks to the Duke's extraordinary qualities combined with a considerable fortune, he fully realized this dream.\nAt his court, Piero della Francesca wrote on the science of perspective, Francesco di Giorgio Martini wrote his Trattato di architettura (Treatise on Architecture) and Raphael's father, Giovanni Santi, wrote his poetical account of the chief artists of his time. Federico's brilliant court, according to the descriptions in Baldassare Castiglione's Il Cortegiano (The Book of the Courtier, published in 1528), set standards of what would characterize a modern European \"gentleman\" for centuries to come.\n\n\n=== Cesare Borgia and the years of the Duchy Della Rovere ===\nCesare Borgia dispossessed Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, and Elisabetta Gonzaga in 1502, with the complicity of his father, Pope Alexander VI. After the attempt of Pope Leo X to appoint a young Medici as duke, thwarted by the early death of Lorenzo II de Medici in 1519, Urbino was part of the Papal States, under the dynasty of the dukes Della Rovere (1508\u20131631). They moved the court to the city of Pesaro in 1523 and Urbino began a slow decline that would continue until the last decades of the seventeenth century.\n\n\n=== Annexation by the Papal States ===\nIn 1626, Pope Urban VIII definitively incorporated the Duchy into the papal dominions, the gift of the last Della Rovere duke, in retirement after the assassination of his heir, to be governed by the archbishop. The state was ruled thereafter by a papal legate, generally belonging to high ecclesiastical hierarchy. Following the annexation of the duchy by the Papal States, the rich artistic heritage (including furniture) of the Ducal Palace went to form, for the most part, the dowry of the last direct descendant of the Della Rovere, Vittoria della Rovere, who married Ferdinand II de Medici. These works went on to form the core of the future Uffizi Gallery. Among the works that went to Florence is the diptych of the Dukes of Urbino by Piero della Francesca. Other works of the Ducal Palace were brought to Rome, such as the Barberini Ex Tables of Fra Carnevale and the famous library, absorbed entirely by the Vatican Library in 1657.\n\n\n=== The Albani and the French occupation ===\nThe eighteenth century opened with the election to the papacy (1701) of Cardinal Giovan Francesco Albani Urbino, under the name of Clement XI. This was a windfall for the city and was its last great era, especially in terms of arts and culture, thanks to funding by Pope Albani and his family. Major renovation of several buildings, churches and monasteries took place; such as Palazzo Albani, part of the fa\u00e7ade of the Town Hall, the Archbishop's Palace, the Chapel Albani (inside the convent of St. Francis), St. Joseph's Oratory, and the internal structure of the churches of San Francesco, San Domenico and St. Augustine. In addition, due to the patronage of the Pope and of his family, the Duomo di Urbino received many improvements (like the new altar) as did other religious institutions in the city. From July 1717 to November 1718 Urbino hosted the court of James Stuart the exiled pretender to the British throne, who had the strong backing of the Papacy.\nThis new age of splendor for the city ended with the death of Clement XI in 1721, placing the city in a long decline that has continued to the present day. After the Pope's death, the Albani family remained the main patron of the most significant works until the first half of the nineteenth century.\nIn 1789, the collapse of the Cathedral dome following a massive earthquake led to the total renovation of the church.\nBetween 1797 and 1800 the city was occupied by French troops, like much of northern and central Italy. During the French occupation Urbino and its territory suffered from the acquisitions of important works of art by the French, which were moved to Paris or Milan, in the nascent galleries of the Louvre and Brera. This event was a further cause of the impoverished local artistic heritage, already tried by the loss of the works following the devolution of the duchy in the seventeenth century.\n\n\n=== Redevelopment of the nineteenth century ===\nThe century opened with the consecration in 1809 of the new Duomo di Urbino, as designed by the architect Giuseppe Valadier, who restored the city's Montefeltro-era buildings, such as the old Seminary, adjacent to the church of St. Sergius, now partly occupied by the Hotel Raffaello.\nFollowing the construction of the New Palace of Alban (1831), designed by architect Peter Ghinelli, which gave rise to the present Piazza della Repubblica that went on to form the first part of the future Corso Garibaldi, the city experienced a number of urban improvements designed to change the face of the city. From the construction of the Sanzio theater (1845\u201353) came the final realization of Corso Garibaldi, with a covered walkway on the downhill side to that ensure theater-goers were sheltered from rain and snow on their walk to the Piazza della Repubblica, with construction that lasted until the early part of the twentieth century. In addition, another important change was the destruction, in 1868, of a part of the walls to create a customs barrier, called Porta Nuova or barrier Margherita (in honor of Princess Margaret of Savoy), which was necessitated by a new road that ran along a stretch of the walls and was connected to Corso Garibaldi. This resulted in a new urban layout with the large spit of land below the Doge's Palace incorporated into the city, called the Pincio.\nThese urban transformations brought about a change in access to the city. Instead of passing through narrow, winding streets, through the gates of the walls, now one could enter through the Porta Nuova in an easier and convenient way to arrive in the present Piazza della Repubblica and the Palazzo Ducale (the city center).\nThis urban renewal reflected many of the ideas of Fulvio Corboli but its design was largely done by the architect Vincenzo Ghinelli.\n\n\n=== Unification of Italy ===\nOn 8 September 1860 the Piedmontese troops entered Urbino from Port Saint Lucia, forcing the surrender of the last resistance of the papal army under the portico of the childhood house of Raphael. But it was not until 29 September, with the capture of Ancona, that the total conquest of the Marche region was completed by the Piedmont army.\nBetween 4 and 5 November, the plebiscite was held for the annexation of the Marche to the Kingdom of Sardinia, which ended with 133,783 votes in favor, 260 votes against and 1,212 invalid ballots. In the province of Urbino (excluding the territory of Pesaro) the count was 21,111 for and 365 against with 29 invalid ballots. Subsequently, on 10 November, the Marche was included in the Statuto Albertino, and then, on 17 December, it was made official with the issuance of a royal decree.The new government began the confiscation of various ecclesiastical goods, including good part of the convent of San Francisco (where a part of a botanical garden, designed by Vincenzo Ghinelli, was located), the monastery of Santa Chiara, that of San Girolamo, and many others.\n\n\n=== First half of the twentieth century ===\nThe century began as had the previous one. This period of quiet lasted for almost the entire first half of the twentieth century, with no particular significant events. In this period, the Scuola del Libro (Istituto per la Decorazione e l'Illustrazione del Libro) was founded and expressed considerable talent both nationally and internationally. In addition to the artistic development from the Scuola del Libro, Urbino also began to grow as a university town, with the elevation to university faculty of nineteenth-century School of Pharmacy and the birth of the department of Education (approximately 1934). Due to these changes in the University, an increase in the student population led to housing shortages that highlighted the state of total unpreparedness of the city, so much that for the first time many students were housed in the homes of private citizens. The problem was partly solved with the establishment of the male boarding school \"Raphael\" at the beginning of the century, and the female boarding school \"Laura Battiferri\" in approximately 1926. \nThis period was dominated by great events of national and international history, which inevitably were expressed in Urbino. The period of the fascist dictatorship left its mark on the city, especially from an architectural point of view, with a fascist elementary school \"Giovanni Pascoli\" (1932) built on the ancient Garden of Saint Lucia (part of the duke's private gardens), the restoration of the palace-Mauruzi Gherardi, then the seat of the court, as well as the Student House, to compensate for the shortage of accommodation as a result of the large increase in university population and housing for the maimed and disabled civilians.\nIn 1938, the city was designated as the headquarters for the fledgling Soprintendenza alle Gallerie e alle Opere d'Arte delle Marche, roughly translated as the Organization of Galleries and Works of Art of the Marche.\nWith the outbreak of World War II the city suffered no bombing, thanks to the large red cross painted on the roof of the Ducal Palace and an agreement between the Germans and the Allies. Only towards the end of the war did the retreating German troops try to destroy all the ramparts of the walls, but luckily the mines were tampered with by the workers the Germans had hired from Urbino. During the retreat, the German army isolated the city with the destruction of rail and road links. In addition, the Germans planned to blow up a tunnel, then under construction, between Urbino and the parish of Schieti that was being used by the Nazis to store weapons. Because of its location at the foot of the historic center, the population feared that an explosion would lead to the destruction of the village above, but this did not happen. During the Second World War, the then Superintendent of the Galleries and Works of Art in Urbino in the Marche Pasquale Rotondi  secretly placed around 10,000 priceless works (including those of Giorgione, Piero della Francesca, Paolo Uccello, Titian, Mantegna, Raphael and many more, from all the major museums in Italy) that were being stolen by the Nazis into the Rock of Sassocorvaro. His actions gained worldwide recognition and to this day the Rock of Sassocorvaro is known as the \u201cArk of Art\u201d.Urbino was liberated from the Nazi occupation on 28 August 1944, thanks to the British V Corps, Polish troops, and the heroic actions of partisan groups in the area. Some of the members of these partisan groups were captured by the Nazis and executed on the current Punto Panoramica, where memorials are now placed celebrating their sacrifice.\n\n\n=== Urbino and De Carlo ===\nThe second half of the twentieth century was characterized in Urbino by the cooperation with the major public institutions (the University and the City) by the architect Giancarlo De Carlo. This relationship began in 1956 when Carlo Bo, former rector of the University, commissioned from De Carlo the internal renovation project of Montefeltro- Bonaventure building, headquarters of the University. Immediately after that, the Genoese architect was commissioned by the City to prepare the General Plan (1958\u201364) aimed at the recovery of the historical center, which had been in poor condition and was in danger of losing several neighborhoods including the Palazzo Ducale to the land subsidence below. This problem was solved thanks to state funding derived from two special laws enacted for the city (in 1968 and in 1982 ).\nSubsequently, De Carlo realized several projects for the university including the college's dormitories, near the Capuchin church outside the city center, an interesting example of how architecture can merge with the surrounding landscape. He also completed projects like the construction of the department of Magisterium (1968\u201376), the restructuring of the department of Law ( 1966\u201368 ) and the Battiferri building (1986\u201399) for the department of Economics. They are three significant examples of the inclusion of a contemporary architecture in an ancient surrounding, and are still studied today.\nThe seventies were marked by a collaboration with the Municipality for a project called Operation Mercatale (1969\u201372), which included the construction of a multi-story underground car park under Torricini's famous Ducal Palace and the restoration of the helical ramp under the theater by Francesco di Giorgio Martini (1971\u201375), in collaboration with the City. They also developed the project of renovation of the Sanzio theater (1977\u201382) and the renovation project, much discussed, of the ancient Ducal Stables. In addition, thanks to the close relationship with De Carlo, the city has hosted twice (1976\u201381, and 1992\u201393) the laboratories of the ILAUD, founded and directed by the Genoese architect.\nOne of the last of De Carlo actions was the preparation, between 1989 and 1994, of the New General Plan.\n\n\n== Maiolica ==\nThe clay earth of Urbino, which still supports industrial brickworks, supplied a cluster of earthenware manufactories (botteghe) making the tin-glazed pottery known as maiolica.  Simple local wares were being made in the 15th century at Urbino, but after 1520 the Della Rovere dukes, Francesco Maria I della Rovere and his successor Guidobaldo II, encouraged the industry, which exported wares throughout Italy, first in a manner called istoriato using engravings after Mannerist painters, then in a style of light arabesques and grottesche after the manner of Raphael's stanze at the Vatican.  Other centers of 16th century wares in the Duchy of Urbino were at Gubbio and Castel Durante. The great name in Urbino majolica was that of Nicolo Pillipario's son Guido Fontana.\n\n\n== Main attractions ==\n\n\n=== Palaces and public buildings ===\nThe main attraction of Urbino is the Palazzo Ducale, begun in the second half of the 15th century by Federico II da Montefeltro. It houses the Galleria Nazionale delle Marche, one of the most important collections of Renaissance paintings in the world.\nOther buildings include Palazzo Albani (17th century), Palazzo Odasi and Palazzo Passionei.\nThe Albornoz Fortress (known locally as La Fortezza), built by the eponymous Papal legate in the 14th century. In 1507-1511, when the Della Rovere added a new series of walls to the city, the rock was enclosed in them. It is now a public park.\nRaphael's house and monument (1897).\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nDuomo: the Cathedral of Urbino was founded in 1021 atop a 6th-century religious edifice. Federico II commissioned the design from the architect Francesco di Giorgio Martini, who also designed the Ducal Palace. Finished in 1604, the Duomo had a simple plan with a nave and two aisles, and was destroyed by an earthquake in 1789. The church was rebuilt in Neoclassic style by the architect Giuseppe Valadier, with work completed in 1801. The new church has a soaring dome, and houses a St Sebastian (1557), an Assumption (1701) by Maratta, and a famous Last Supper (1603\u20131608) by Federico Barocci.\nSant'Agostino: the church was built in 13th-century Romanesque style, but largely modified in following centuries. The fa\u00e7ade has a late-14th century almond portal in Gothic-Romanesque style, while the interior is greatly decorated. It houses a carved choir from the 16th century, created for the marriage of Costanzo Sforza and Camilla of Aragona. The bell tower is from the 15th century.\nSan Francesco: This 14th-century church was originally a Gothic-Romanesque edifice, but an 18th-century restoration has left only the portico and the bell tower. The interior has a nave and two aisles, and houses the Pardon of St Francis, a 15th-century work by Barocci.\nOratory of San Giovanni Battista: the oratory has 15th-century frescoes by Lorenzo Salimbeni\nOratory of San Giuseppe (early 16th century), composed of two chapels: one of which contains a 16th-century stucco presepio or Nativity scene by Federico Brandani with highly naturalistic, life-size figures.\nSan Bernardino: church outside the city center, housing the tombs of the Dukes of Urbino.\n\n\n=== Other points of interest ===\nOrto Botanico \"Pierina Scaramella\", a botanical garden\nUniversity of Urbino, housed in various old and new buildings within the city centre.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nBartolomeo Carusi, theologian and professor at Bologna and Paris\nBattista Malatesta (1384\u20131448), Renaissance poet\nBernardino Baldi, mathematician and writer\nClorinda Corradi, lyrical singer (1804\u201377)\nCrispino Agostinucci, bishop of Montefeltro\nDonato Bramante was born nearby, and witnessed Laurana's work going up while he was a youth\nElisabetta Gonzaga  Duchess of Urbino (1471\u20131526)\nFederico Barocci, painter\nFederico Commandini (1509), mathematician\nFederico III da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, medieval condottiere and patron of the arts\nFederico Zuccari and Taddeo Zuccari, painters, were born nearby\nFernando Aiuti (1935), immunologist\nFrancesco Puccinotti (1794\u20131872), pathologist\nGiovanni Francesco Albani, Pope Clement XI\nGiovanni Santi, painter and poet, father of Raphael, was born nearby\nGuidobaldo II della Rovere, Duke of Urbino, commissioned the Venus of Urbino painting\nMuzio Oddi (1569-1639), mathematician, architect, military engineer, writer\nOttaviano Petrucci, inventor of the music print with movable type, was born nearby\nPaolo Volponi (1924\u201394), writer and poet\nPolydore Vergil or Virgil, chronicler in England\nRaffaello Carboni, writer\nRaphael Gualazzi, jazz pianist and singer, runner-up in the 2011 Eurovision Song Contest\nRaphael, painter; his family's house is a museum-shrine\nUmberto Piersanti, poet and writer\nValentino Rossi, multiple MotoGP World Champion\nMarica Branchesi, astrophysicist\nStefano Sensi, association football player\n\n\n== See also ==\nArchdiocese of Urbino-Urbania-Sant'Angelo in Vado\nDukes of Urbino\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\n\n== Sources ==\nNegroni, F.

        "wiki": "Rimini ( RIM-in-ee, Italian: [\u02c8ri\u02d0mini] (listen); Romagnol: R\u00e9min; Latin: Ariminum) is a city in the Emilia-Romagna region of northern Italy and capital city of the Province of Rimini. It sprawls along the Adriatic Sea, on the coast between the rivers Marecchia (the ancient Ariminus) and Ausa (ancient Aprusa). It is one of the most notable seaside resorts in Europe with revenue from both internal and international tourism forming a significant portion of the city's economy. The first bathing establishment opened in 1843. Rimini is an art city with ancient Roman and Renaissance monuments, and is also the birthplace of the famous film director Federico Fellini.\nThe city was founded by the Romans in 268 BC. Throughout Roman times, Rimini was a key communications link between the north and south of the peninsula. On its soil, Roman emperors erected monuments such as the Arch of Augustus and the Tiberius Bridge to mark the beginning and the end of the Decumanus of Rimini. During the Renaissance, the city benefited from the court of the House of Malatesta, which hosted artists like Leonardo da Vinci and produced works such as the Tempio Malatestiano. The main monuments in Rimini are the Tiberius Bridge and the Arch of Augustus.\nIn the 19th century, Rimini was one of the most active cities on the revolutionary front, hosting many of the movements seeking to achieve Italian unification. In the course of World War II, the city was the scene of numerous clashes and bombings, but also of a fierce partisan resistance that earned it the honour of a gold medal for civic valour. In recent years it has become one of the most important sites for trade fairs and conferences in Italy.\nAs of 31 May 2019, Rimini's urban area was home to 150,951 people, with approximately 325,000 living in the eponymous province, making it the twenty-eighth largest city in Italy.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient history ===\n\nThe area was part of the Etruscan civilization until the arrival of the Celts, who held it from the 6th century BC until their defeat by the Umbri in 283 BC. In 268 BC at the mouth of the Ariminus (now called the Marecchia), the Roman Republic founded the colonia of Ariminum.\nThe city was involved in the civil wars but remained faithful to the popular party and to its leaders, firstly Gaius Marius, and then Julius Caesar. After crossing the Rubicon, the latter made his legendary appeal to the legions in the Forum of Rimini.\nAriminum was seen as a bastion against invaders from Celts and also as a springboard for conquering the Padana plain. As the terminus of the Via Flaminia, which ended in the town at the surviving prestigious Arch of Augustus (erected 27 BC), Rimini was a road junction connecting central and northern Italy by the Via Aemilia that led to Piacenza and the Via Popilia that extended northwards; it also opened up trade by sea and river. Remains of the amphitheatre that could seat 12,000 people, and a five-arched bridge of Istrian stone completed by Tiberius (21 AD) are still visible. Later Galla Placidia built the church of Santo Stefano. The evidence that Rimini is of Roman origins is illustrated by the city being divided by two main streets, the Cardo and the Decumanus.\nThe end of Roman rule was marked by destruction caused by invasions and wars, but also by the establishment of the palaces of the Imperial officers and the first churches, the symbol of the spread of Christianity that held the important Council of Ariminum in the city in 359.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nWhen the Ostrogoths conquered Rimini in 493, Odoacer, besieged in Ravenna, had to capitulate. During the Gothic War (535\u2013554), Rimini was taken and retaken many times. In its vicinity the Byzantine general Narses overthrew (553) the Alamanni. Under the Byzantine rule, it belonged to the Pentapolis, part of the Exarchate of Ravenna.\nIn 728, it was taken with many other cities by Liutprand, King of the Lombards but returned to the Byzantines about 735. Pepin the Short gave it to the Holy See, but during the wars of the popes and the Italian cities against the emperors, Rimini sided with the latter.\nIn the 13th century, it suffered from the discords of the Gambacari and Ansidei families. The city became a municipality in the 14th century, and with the arrival of the religious orders, numerous convents and churches were built, providing work for many illustrious artists. In fact, Giotto inspired the 14th-century School of Rimini, which was the expression of original cultural ferment.\nThe House of Malatesta emerged from the struggles between municipal factions with Malatesta da Verucchio, who in 1239 was named podest\u00e0 (chief magistrate) of the city. Despite interruptions, his family held authority until 1528. In 1312 he was succeeded by Malatestino Malatesta, first signore (lord) of the city and Pandolfo I Malatesta, the latter's brother, named by Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, as imperial vicar of Romagna. Ferrantino, son of Malatesta II (1335), was opposed by his cousin Ramberto and by Cardinal Bertrand du Pouget (1331), legate of Pope John XXII. Malatesta II was also lord of Pesaro. He was succeeded by Malatesta Ungaro (1373) and Galeotto I Malatesta, uncle of the former (1385), lord also of Fano (from 1340), Pesaro, and Cesena (1378).\nHis son Carlo I Malatesta, one of the most respected condottieri of the time, enlarged the Riminese possessions and restored the port. Carlo died childless in 1429, and the lordship was divided into three parts, Rimini going to Galeotto Roberto Malatesta, a Catholic zealot who turned out to be totally inadequate for the role. The Pesarese line of the Malatestas tried, in fact, to take advantage of his weakness and to capture the city, but Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, Carlo's nephew, who was only 14 at the time, intervened to save it. Galeotto retired to a convent, and Sigismondo obtained the rule of Rimini.\nSigismondo Pandolfo was the most famous lord of Rimini. In 1433, Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, sojourned in the city and for a while he was the commander-in-chief of the Papal armies. A skilled general, Sigismondo often acted as condottiero for other states to gain money to embellish it (he was also a dilettante poet). He had the famous Tempio Malatestiano rebuilt by Leon Battista Alberti. However, after the rise of Pope Pius II, he had to fight constantly for the independence of the city. In 1463 he was forced to submit to Pius II, who left him only Rimini and little more; Roberto Malatesta, his son (1482), under Pope Paul II, nearly lost his state, but under Pope Sixtus IV, became the commanding officer of the pontifical army against Ferdinand of Naples. Sigismondo was, however, defeated by Neapolitan forces in the battle of Campomorto (1482). Pandolfo IV, his son (1500), lost Rimini to Cesare Borgia, after whose overthrow it fell to Venice (1503\u20131509), but it was later retaken by Pope Julius II and incorporated into the Papal States. After the death of Pope Leo X, Pandolfo returned for several months, and with his son Sigismondo Malatesta held a rule which looked tyrannous even for the time. Pope Adrian VI expelled him again and gave Rimini to the Duke of Urbino, the pope's vicar in Romagna. In 1527 Sigismondo managed to regain the city, but in the following year the Malatesta dominion died forever.\n\n\n=== Renaissance and Enlightment ===\n\nAt the beginning of the 16th century, Rimini, now a secondary town of the Papal States, was ruled by an Apostolic Legate. Towards the end of the 16th century, the municipal square (now Piazza Cavour), which had been closed off on a site where the Poletti Theatre was subsequently built, was redesigned. The statue of Pope Paul V has stood in the centre of the square next to the fountain since 1614.\nIn the 16th century, the 'grand square' (now the Piazza Tre Martiri in honor of three civilians hanged by the retreating Nazis at the end of World War II), which was where markets and tournaments were held, underwent various changes. A small temple dedicated to Saint Anthony of Padua and a clock tower were built there, giving the square its present shape and size.\nUntil the 18th century raiding armies, earthquakes, famines, floods and pirate attacks ravaged the city. In this gloomy situation and due to a weakened local economy, fishing took on great importance, a fact testified by the construction of structures such as the fish market and the lighthouse.\nIn 1797, Rimini, along with the rest of Romagna, was affected by the passage of the Napoleonic army and became part of the Cisalpine Republic. Napoleonic policy suppressed the monastic orders, confiscating their property and thus dispersing a substantial heritage, and demolished many churches including the ancient cathedral of Santa Colomba.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nOn 30 March 1815, Joachim Murat launched his Rimini Proclamation to the Italian people from here, hoping to incite them to unity and independence. In 1845, a band of adventurers commanded by Ribbotti entered the city and proclaimed a constitution which was soon abolished. In 1860, Rimini and Romagna were incorporated into the Kingdom of Italy.\nThe city was transformed after the 1843 founding of the first bathing establishment and the Kursaal, a building constructed to host sumptuous social events, became the symbol of Rimini's status as a tourist resort. In just a few years, the seafront underwent considerable development work making Rimini 'the city of small villas'. At the beginning of the 20th century, The Grand Hotel, the city's first major accommodation facility, was built near the beach.\nDuring the first World War, Rimini and its surrounding infrastructure was one of the primary targets of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. After Italy's declaration of war on 15 May 1915, the Austro-Hungarian fleet left its harbours the same day and started its assault on the Adriatic coast between Venice and Barletta.\nDuring World War II, the city was torn apart by heavy bombardments and by the passage of the front over the Gothic Line during the Battle of Rimini and was eventually captured by Greek and Canadian forces. Following its liberation on September 21, 1944, reconstruction work began, culminating in huge development of the tourist industry in the city.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nRimini is situated at 44\u00b003\u203200\u2033 north and 12\u00b034\u203200\u2033 east, along the coast of the Adriatic sea, at the southeastern edge of Emilia-Romagna, at a short distance from Montefeltro and Marche. Rimini extends for 135.71 square km and borders the municipalities of Bellaria-Igea Marina, San Mauro Pascoli, and Santarcangelo di Romagna towards NW, Verucchio and Serravalle towards SW, Coriano towards S, and Riccione towards SE. The city is also located at the intersection of three Roman roads: Via Emilia, Via Popilia, and Via Flaminia. Viserba is the most important of Rimini's northern districts, with 8,556 inhabitants.\nRimini is located in a historically strategic position, at the extreme southern edge of the Po Valley, at the junction point of Northern and Central Italy.\nIt is surrounded towards southwest by the gently rolling hills of Covignano (153 metres high), Vergiano (81 m), San Martino Monte l'Abbate (57 m) and San Lorenzo in Correggiano (60 m), widely cultivated, with vineyards, olive groves and orchards, and dominated by ancient mansions. These hills, mostly made of clay and sand, connect the plains, created by the Marecchia and Ausa, the two most important rivers of Rimini territory, to the higher hills of the Apennines.\nThe Marecchia river runs through its valley and the plain in a very large riverbed and, after confluence with the Ausa, it flows into the Adriatic sea through a deviator between San Giuliano Mare and Rivabella, while the ancient riverbed is used in its last section as the city's harbour.\nThe Marecchia, usually with little water flow, was subjected to periodic, destructive floods near its mouth, where the riverbed became narrow after various bends: for this reason it was deviated north.  Ausa creek, which was the eastern limit of Rimini for many centuries, was deviated as well after World War II, and its original riverbed was filled and turned into an urban park.\nThe coastal strip, made of recent marine deposits, is edged by a fine sandy beach, 15 km long and up to 200 metres wide, interrupted only by the mouth of the rivers and gently shelving towards the sea. Along the coastline there is a low sandy cliff, created by sea rise around 4000 B.C., partly conserved north of Rimini, between Rivabella and Bellaria-Igea Marina, at a distance of about 1,300 metres from the coast.Rimini's territory, for its geographical position and its climatic features, is situated on the edge between the mediterranean and the central European phytoclimatic zones, and thus it represents an environment of notable naturalistic value.\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nRimini is the main centre of a 50 kilometres (31 miles) long coastal conurbation, which extends from Cervia to Gabicce Mare, including the seaside resorts of Cesenatico, Gatteo a Mare, Bellaria-Igea Marina, Riccione, Misano Adriatico and Cattolica. The conurbation has about 300,000 inhabitants and originated around the mid-20th century due to urban sprawl following intensive tourism development.\nThe city of Rimini includes the seaside localities and districts of Torre Pedrera, Viserbella, Viserba, Rivabella, San Giuliano Mare towards north and Bellariva, Marebello, Rivazzurra, Miramare towards south. These districts are important to tourism in Rimini.\nThe city proper includes the historic centre, the four ancient boroughs of S. Giuliano, S. Giovanni, S. Andrea and Marina, the seaside district of Marina Centro and various modern districts\u2014Celle, Marecchiese, INA Casa, V PEEP, Colonnella, Lagomaggio\u2014and outer suburbs such as Padulli, Spadarolo, Covignano, Grottarossa and Villaggio 1\u00b0 Maggio, located outside of the Adriatic Highway beltline. More outer suburbs are S. Giustina, S. Vito, Spadarolo, Vergiano, Corpol\u00f2 and Gaiofana.\nThe historic centre of Rimini, surrounded by the city walls built by Malatesta, and formerly bounded by the Marecchia and Ausa rivers, has a distinctive, regular urban structure of Roman origins. It was divided since the Middle Ages in four districts (Rioni): Cittadella, Clodio, Pomposo and Montecavallo. The boundaries of these districts are not known, but it is assumed that they followed the current Corso d'Augusto, Via Garibaldi, and Via Gambalunga. Additionally, the ancient coastline was situated much farther inland than today's; it gradually shifted outward over centuries and the new land was developed throughout the 20th century.Rione Cittadella, in the western area of the centre, was the most important district of the city and included the Municipal palaces, Castel Sismondo and the Cathedral of Santa Colomba. Rione Clodio, towards the north, was popular and a peculiar urban structure tied with the near Marecchia river. Rione Pomposo, the widest district of the city, included large orchards and convents. Rione Montecavallo, on the southern part of the historical centre, is characterized by bowed, irregular streets of medieval origins, by the Fossa Patara creek and a small hill called \"Montirone\".Outside of the city walls, there are four boroughs (Borghi), which were entirely incorporated to the city by the urban sprawl in early 20th century.Borgo S. Giuliano, along Via Emilia, dates back to the 11th century and was originally a fishermen's settlement. Dominated by the Church of San Giuliano, it is one of the most picturesque spots of the city, with narrow streets and squares, colourful small houses and many frescoes representing characters and places of Federico Fellini's films.\nBorgo S. Giovanni, on both sides of Via Flaminia, was populated by artisans and middle-class; Borgo S. Andrea, located outside of Porta Montanara, along Via Covignano, Via Montefeltro and Via Monte Titano, was strictly tied with agriculture and commerce of cows. Both these two boroughs were developed in 15th century; then they burned in a fire in 1469 and were rebuilt in 19th century, relocating small industries and manufactures, including a brick factory and a phosphorus matches factory.\nBorgo Marina, situated on the right bank of the Marecchia, was a portual borough, heavily transformed by Fascist demolitions and World War II bombings, which hit this area due to the proximity to the bridges of the city and the railway station.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nRimini has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa) moderated by the influence of the Adriatic sea, featuring the highest autumn and winter mean temperatures and the highest annual low temperatures in Emilia-Romagna.Precipitations are equally distributed during the year, with a peak in October (75 mm) and two slight minimums, in January (42 mm) and July (43 mm). In spring, autumn and winter precipitations mainly come from oceanic fronts, while in summer they are brought by thunderstorms, coming from the Apennines or the Po Valley.\nHumidity is high all year round, with a minimum of 72% in June and July and a maximum of 84% in November and December. Prevailing winds blow from W, S, E and NE. Southwesterly winds, known as libeccio or garbino, are foehn winds, which may bring warm temperatures in each season. On average, there are over 2,040 sunshine hours per year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nAs of 2019, Rimini has 150,951 inhabitants, with a density of about 1,100 inhabitants per square kilometre within the city limits.\nIn 1861, by the time of the first Italian census, the population was around 28,000; in 1931 it was more than double, 57,000.\nWith the increasing tourism development, population rapidly grew between 1951 and 1981, the fastest growing period for Rimini in the 20th century, when the city's population grew from 77,000 to over 128,000.During the 20th century, two former districts of Rimini got administrative autonomy, causing two distinct temporary drops in population totals: Riccione in 1922 and Bellaria-Igea Marina in 1956.\nForeign population is 18,396, (12.5% of the total), mainly from Eastern Europe, East Asia and North Africa. Between 1992 and 2014, foreign population grew from around 1,800 to over 18,000 units. \nThe most important foreign communities are Albanians (3,479), Romanians (2,904), Ukrainians (2,409), Chinese (1,197) and Moldovans (1,023). Other notable foreign groups in the city are Senegalese, Moroccans, Macedonians, Tunisians, Russians, Bangladeshis and Peruvians.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nRimini's population is mostly Catholic. The city is the seat of the Diocese of Rimini, a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Ravenna-Cervia.\nThe first cathedral of the diocese was the former Cathedral of Santa Colomba until 1798, when the title was transferred to the church of Sant'Agostino. Since 1809, Rimini's cathedral is the Tempio Malatestiano.\nBesides Roman Catholic churches, there are also Orthodox, Evangelical and Adventist churches. Between the 13th and 14th century, Rimini had a flourishing Jewish community, which built three distinct synagogues, all destroyed, formerly located around the area of Piazza Cavour, Via Cairoli and Santa Colomba.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nRimini is a major international tourist destination and seaside resort, among the most famous ones in Europe and the Mediterranean basin, thanks to a long sandy beach, well-equipped bathing establishments, theme parks and a number of opportunities for leisure and spare time. The economy of the city is entirely based on tourism, whose development started in the first half of the 19th century and increased after World War II.\nRimini's origins as a seaside resort date back to 1843, when the first \"Bathing Establishment\" was founded, the oldest one of the Adriatic Sea. The width of the beach, the gentle gradient of the sea bed, the equipment of bathing establishments, the luxurious hotels, the mildness of the climate, the richness of curative waters, the prestigious social events, made Rimini a renowned tourist destination among the Italian and European aristocracy.\n\nTourism in Rimini started as therapeutic stay (thalassotherapy, hydrotherapy and heliotherapy), evolving into elite vacation in the late 19th century, into middle-class tourism during the fascist era and finally into mass tourism in the postwar period.On summer nights, there is a festival called \"La Notte Rosa\".\nRimini concentrates a quarter of Emilia-Romagna's hotels, with over 1,000 hotels, 300 of which are open all year round, and hundreds of apartment hotels, apartments, holiday homes, bed & breakfast and campings. Tourism is mainly based on seaside holidays, but also includes trade fairs and conventions, events, nightlife, culture, wellness, food and wine.\nRimini is a leading trade fair and convention site in Italy, with an important trade fair (Rimini Fiera) and a convention centre (Palacongressi di Rimini).\nThe city's other economic sectors, such as services, commerce, construction industry, have been influenced by the development of tourism. Commerce is one of the main economic sectors, thanks to the presence of a large wholesale center, two hypermarkets, department stores, supermarkets and hundreds of shops and boutiques. Industry, less developed than tourism and services, includes various companies active in food industry, woodworking machineries, building constructions, furnishing, clothing and publishing. Notable companies are Bimota (motorcycles), SCM (woodworking machines), Trevi S.p.A. (electronic goods). Rimini is also seat of a historic railway works plant.Agriculture and fishing were the city's main economic sources until the early 20th century. Rimini boasts an important tradition in wine production (Sangiovese, Trebbiano, Rebola, Pagadebit, Albana wines) and an historic extra virgin olive oil production. The most common crops of the area, besides vineyards and olive groves, are orchards (peaches, nectarines, apricots, persimmons, apples, pears, cherries, kiwifruits and plums), vegetables and legumes (lettuce, zucchini, potatoes, tomatoes, beans, green beans, cauliflowers, fennels, strawberries), seminatives (wheat, barley, grain sorghum, corn, oat), sunflowers and canola. The fishing industry can count on a fleet of about 100 fishing boats, the most consistent of Rimini's fishing department, which includes the coast between Cattolica and Cesenatico.\n\n\n== Arts and culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe City Museum (Museo della Citt\u00e0), main museal institution of Rimini, was inaugurated as \"Archaeology Gallery\", at the ground floor of Palazzo Gambalunga in 1872, thanks to Riminese historian Luigi Tonini, active in researching and studying the local archaeological heritage. The Archaeology Gallery was the first museum of the city and was conceived as a collection of Etruscan civilization and Roman antiquities, found in Rimini and in the surrounding countryside.\nThe civic museum was arranged in San Francesco monastery in 1923 and in 1938 was enlarged with a section of Medieval Art. The objects avoided the destructions of World War II, being moved between 1940 and 1943 to two different shelters in Spadarolo and Novafeltria. In 1964, the collections were moved to Palazzo Visconti and finally, from 1990, to the Collegio dei Gesuiti, a large Jesuit convent designed by bolognese architect Alfonso Torreggiani, built in 1749.\n\nIn the Archaeological department are exhibited grave goods from Villanovian tombs of Verucchio and Covignano, architectural pieces, sculptures, mosaics, ceramics, coins of Republican and Imperial eras, and the exceptional medical kit from the Domus del Chirurgo. The collection of the Roman Lapidary, exhibited in the inner courtyard of the convent, has funerary monuments, epigraphies and milestones.\nThe Medieval and Modern Art departments include collections of paintings, sculptures and art objects by artists from Romagna (Giovanni da Rimini, Giuliano da Rimini, Guido Cagnacci), Emilia (Guercino, Vittorio Maria Bigari), Tuscany (Domenico Ghirlandaio, Agostino di Duccio) and Veneto (Giovanni Bellini), from 14th to 19th century. The City Museum arranges temporary exhibitions and promotes researches, study and restoration activities of the city's historical and artistic heritage.\nThe Fellini Museum (Museo Fellini), dedicated to Federico Fellini, houses temporary exhibitions of documents, drawings, scenographies and costumes related to the movie production of the famous film director.The Museum of Glances (Museo degli Sguardi), housed in Villa Alvarado, on Covignano hill, was instituted in 2005 acquiring the objects of the former Museum of Extra European Cultures \"Dinz Rialto\", founded in Rimini in 1972 by explorer Delfino Dinz Rialto, the art pieces of the former Missionary Museum of the Grazie and other private collections. The museum has over 3,000 objects coming from China, Oceania, Africa and pre-Columbian America, with paintings, sculptures, everyday objects, totems, masks, musical instruments and clothes illustrating how the Western world has looked at these territories' cultures through history.\nThe Museum of Small Fishing and Marine (Museo della Piccola Pesca e della Marineria), in Viserbella, shows the history of Rimini's Marine through a collection of boats, fishing tools, photographs and a large seashells collection, with pieces from all over the Mediterranean Sea.In the municipality of Rimini there are also two private museums: the Aviation Museum (Museo dell'Aviazione) in Sant'Aquilina, close to the boundary of the Republic of San Marino, and the National Museum of Motorcycle (Museo Nazionale del Motociclo) in Casalecchio.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nThe Gambalunghiana Library, historic institution founded in 1617 by jurist Alessandro Gambalunga, plays a leading role in the city's cultural life. The library has over 280,000 books, including 60,000 ancient books, 1,350 manuscripts, 6,000 prints and 80,000 photographs. Among the incunables, dated back from the 15th century, stand out De Claris mulieribus (1497) by Giacomo Filippo Foresti and De re militari by Roberto Valturio. The collection of illuminated manuscripts, coming from different cultural and linguistic European boundaries, includes the Regalis Historia by Frate Leonardo and De Civitate Dei by Saint Augustine.\n\n\n=== Theatre and Films ===\n\nThe first stable theatre in Rimini is documented since 1681, when the city council decided on the transformation of the Arengo's main hall into a large theatre hall, hosting shows of amateur dramatics companies and the young Carlo Goldoni, who was studying philosophy in the city at that time.\nBetween 1842 and 1857 the great Municipal Theatre Vittorio Emanuele II was built, designed in Neoclassical style by the architect Luigi Poletti, according to the traditional canons of the 19th-century Italian theatre. The theatre was inaugurated by Giuseppe Verdi, who directed \"L'Aroldo\", and hosted prestigious opera seasons until its destruction in 1943 due to aerial bombings. Since 1947, it has been called Amintore Galli Theatre. Since its closure, theatre shows has been hosted in the modern Teatro Ermete Novelli in Marina Centro.\nRimini appeared on the movie screen for the first time in some early footages, such as the documentary \"Rimini l'Ostenda d'Italia\" (1912), and in various Istituto Luce's newsreels in the Thirties. The film director Federico Fellini, was born and raised in Rimini, portrayed characters, places and atmospheres of his hometown through his movies, which however were almost entirely shot in Cinecitt\u00e0's studios in Rome: I Vitelloni, 8 e \u00bd (Oscar award in 1964), I clowns, Amarcord (Oscar award in 1975). Other Italian movies filmed in Rimini includes \"La prima notte di quiete\" by Valerio Zurlini, \"Rimini Rimini\" by Sergio Corbucci, \"Abbronzatissimi\" by Bruno Gaburro, \"Sole negli occhi\" by Andrea Porporati, \"Da zero a dieci\" by Luciano Ligabue and \"Non pensarci\" by Gianni Zanasi.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe earliest musician from Rimini was Saint Arduino (10th century); a musical tradition of some distinction was witnessed in the following century by the presence of a music school, named \"Scuola cantorum\", at the Cathedral of Santa Colomba. French composer Guillaume Dufay stayed in Rimini, at Malatesta's court until 1427. In 1518 Pietro Aaron became the first choirmaster of the Cathedral's chapel. In 1690 Carlo Tessarini, violinist and composer, was born in Rimini. The city also gave birth to the musician Benedetto Neri, professor at the Academy of Music in Milan.\nAmintore Galli, illustrious musicologist and composer born in Talamello in 1845, attended the city's Classical Lyceum before moving to Milan, where he studied at the Academy of Music; in 1945 the Municipal Theatre of Rimini was dedicated to him.Between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many social events and dance parties took place at the Bathing Establishment, hosting celebrities such as soprano Elena Bianchini-Cappelli and tenor Enrico Caruso.\nIn recent years, the city inspired the homonymous music album by Fabrizio De Andr\u00e9, released in 1978, and it is cited in various popular Italian and foreign songs by Fabrizio De Andr\u00e9, Francesco Guccini, Nino Rota, Elvis Costello, Fred Buscaglione. Also born in Rimini were the songwriter Samuele Bersani and the composer and music producer Carlo Alberto Rossi, author of some of Mina's songs.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nRimini's cuisine is simple and characterized by intense flavours, and it is indissolubly related to the traditions of rural culture, with peculiar influences due to the city's position between the sea and the hills, near the edge between Romagna and Marche.\nThe traditional first course is pasta, which includes regular pasta, pasta in broth and baked pasta, prepared in many different shapes. Almost all pasta dishes require a base of \"sfoglia\", a dough of eggs and flour, handmade with a rolling pin. First courses include cappelletti, passatelli in broth, lasagne, cannelloni, nidi di rondine, ravioli, tagliatelle, garganelli, maltagliati, gnocchi and strozzapreti, seasoned with bolognese sauce or a dressing of butter and sage.\nSecond courses include meat dishes, such as pollo alla cacciatora, rabbit in porchetta, meat-filled zucchini, sausages and mixed grilled meats, and fish dishes, like barbecues of atlantic mackerels, sardines, rotisseries of oily fishes, sepias with peas, fried squids and gianchetti (known here as \"omini nudi\").Piada is a flatbread of ancient traditions, thin and crumbly, obtained from a dough of flour, water, lard and salt, and baked on a scorching \"testo\" of terracotta or cast iron. It is often accompanied by grilled meats or fishes, sausages, gratin\u00e9e vegetables, salami, prosciutto, fresh cheeses and country herbs. Cassoni, are stuffed flatbreads similar to piada, with various fillings: country herbs, potatoes and sausages, tomato and mozzarella. Side dishes include mixed salads, gratin\u00e9e vegetables, roasted potatoes, saut\u00e9e bladder campion leaves, marinated olives with dill, garlic and orange zest.\nTraditional desserts are ciambella, Carnevale's fried fiocchetti and castagnole, piada dei morti (a doughnut with walnuts, raisins, pinenuts and almonds, prepared in November), zuppa inglese (a rich dessert with custard, savoiardi and liqueurs), caramelized figs, peaches in white wine and strawberries in red wine.\nTypical local products are squacquerone (a fresh cheese) and saba, a grape syrup used to prepare desserts. Quality extra virgin olive oil is traditionally produced in Rimini area since ancient times.\nThe most famous wines include Sangiovese, Trebbiano, Pagadebit, Rebola, Cabernet Sauvignon and Albana, a dessert wine of Roman origins.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nRimini has a rich historical and artistic heritage, which includes churches and monasteries, villas and palaces, fortifications, archaeological sites, streets and squares. This richness is the result of the succession of various civilizations, dominations and historical events through 22 centuries of history: the Romans, the Byzantines, the role of medieval comune and capital of the Malatesta seignory, the Venetian Republic and the Papal States dominations.\nThe city has always been a key gate to the Orient and the southern areas of the Mediterranean, thanks to its geographical position and the importance of its harbour, and a meeting point between cultures of Northern and Central Italy.\nRimini has monuments of all epochs, with important examples of architecture from the Roman age, such as the Arch of Augustus, the Tiberius Bridge, the Amphiteatre and the Domus del Chirurgo; from the Middle Ages, such as the Palazzo dell'Arengo, the church of Sant'Agostino and Castel Sismondo; from the Renaissance, with the Tempio Malatestiano, masterpiece of Leon Battista Alberti.Rimini's archaeological heritage includes various domus of Republican and Imperial age, characterized by polychrome or black and white mosaics, necropolis and sections of the pavement of the ancient Roman streets.\nThe city, along with its boroughs and the seaside district of Marina Centro, also preserves a wide architectural heritage from the Baroque, the Neoclassical and Art Nouveau periods, with churches, palaces, hotels and mansions, which reveal its role of cultural, political, trading centre and famous seaside resort.\nThe city has a Roman structure, partly modified by following medieval transformations. A continuous evolution, through the urban renovation of the Malatesta, earthquakes, the suppressions of monasteries, has led to a peculiar stratification of historic sites and buildings. The bombings of World War II destroyed the city almost completely, compromising the monumental heritage and the integrity of the city centre, which has been reconstructed and restored in order to valorize its historic places and its numerous fine buildings.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Main sights ===\n\n\n==== Religious buildings ====\nTempio Malatestiano: The original gothic-style cathedral of San Francesco was built in the 13th century, but reconstructed into a Renaissance masterwork by the Florentine architect Leon Battista Alberti, commissioned by Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, hence the name.

The villa was built in the 17th century for want of the Diotallevi family; in 1843 it was purchased by French historian and archaeologist Adolphe No\u00ebl des Vergers and entirely renovated between 1880 and 1890 by architect Arthur-Stanislas Diet. The palace is a typical example of Napoleon III Eclectic architecture, with a main building fronted by a pronaos and flanked by two lateral wings, and internal halls characterized by Neoclassical furnitures and decorations. The villa is surrounded by a 6 hectares park, which includes a water parterre, a formal giardino all'italiana and a landscape garden, with groups of evergreen oaks, pines and cypresses which frame the palace in scenographic perspectives.\n\n\n==== Monuments ====\nArch of Augustus: This arch built in 27 BC has a single gate 9.92 metres (33 ft) high and 8.45 metres (28 ft) wide.

Built in Istria stone, the bridge consists of five arches that rest on massive pillars with breakwater spurs set at an oblique angle with respect to the bridge's axis in order to follow the current. The bridge's structure, on the other hand, rests on a practical system of wooden poles.\nTorre dell'Orologio: The Clock tower was built in 1547 in Piazza Tre Martiri, replacing the ancient \"beccherie\" (public butcher's), and reconstructed in 1759 by Giovan Francesco Buonamici.

          "It's very good. The only thing that the guys who let in on the slides have to agree well on the height. Some let in if 2cm are missing, others not even at 140cm.Boo ... anyway congratulations for everything else \u2026",
          "Very nice and all in all enjoyable attractions despite the flood of people ...\nCertainly it is not cheap (maybe you could pay for a family ticket ...).\nPS: if I catch the wretch who stole my new Nike slippers \u2026",
          "Total disappointment ... Entered at 13.30 paying 35 euros each, discovering that if we had entered from 14.30 we would have paid 20 (and therefore that after an hour more people would have arrived). Park absolutely \u2026",
          "Always perfectly maintained, friendly staff and finally, thanks to the fairly high price, the selection of customers comes by itself !!! This statement does not want to be absolutely provocative, it is only to say \u2026",
          "My daughter says \"it is better that the children do not go there because it is almost all for the great\" ... innocent words .... The park is very beautiful and anyway we had fun in the wave pool. In fact for children \u2026",
          "I thought better, funny slides ... at least I think, I was in the queue 20 minutes then I got the urge and I went to do the little slides ...... too much waiting, mostly in a weekly day with little turnout. A little \u2026",
          "The park is really beautiful, but the mid-August period is not suitable. Too many people, endless queues, in a whole day you can make very few slides. The second entry for 3 euros helps but does not resolve. \u2026",
          "Magnificent water park, fun with its attractions. The only downside are the queues in almost all the slides you have to do and waits can be up to 45 minutes. But it's worth it.\n\n",
          "Cool park for the whole family! With each visit you can relax, relax and at the same time feel the drive on the steepest slides. The service is top notch, but despite the entrance fee for additional services you have \u2026",
          "Total disgust, 35 \u20ac of ticket to do 2 hours in a row to slide, announce shows during the day that will never do, most of the staff rude and the place is not even all I'm much ... disappointment more total, apparte for \u2026",
          "Funny, nice and entertaining staff.\nSlides to fix a little, especially in the joints, sometimes they are painful / annoying.\nBeautiful facility overall but needs a breath of fresh air.\n\n",
          "Great for fun, but inconsistent for rules child height 1.40 for access to all games. We have to wait for the shift change and on the basis of the lifeguard on duty the lifeguard has the faculty to let my son pass, \u2026",
          "I love this place. But today I witnessed a bad scene: a mother (I think Chinese) runs and brings the child of about three years to pee in the elephant's pool. The most serious thing is that the staf boy is there at \u2026",
          "Today I was with my boyfriend at this beautiful water park, it has many attractions both for children and for adults, very organized, many shows starting from the bathing track with foam for the little ones, swimming \u2026",
          "From this year the entry for the second day costs 3 euros per person ... but you pay in advance ...\nSo if by chance you can't get back you lose the money, which for a \"family\" are not few.\nIn addition, children of 8 \u2026",
          "Beautiful property, great fun, these are the positive aspects.\nExpensive ticket, because in addition you have to pay for parking (which is exempt from everything), umbrellas and sunbeds. It's high bar prices / \u2026",
          "We were with the girls several times, always a pleasure\n\n",
          "Nice big rich even though I haven't been anywhere else to compare.\nEntrance paid 33 euros parking 5 euros locker 4 euros total 42 euros and if you plan to eat or take a sunbed .... A day in 2 here that we were passing \u2026",
          "Games for all tastes and fun guaranteed. Prices a little high. I would ask the lifeguards to smile ... I understand that the whole day is challenging ..... With a smile you work better.\n\n",
          "Guaranteed fun. I went with my friends and it was a fantastic day. It is always full of activity and this can only be that positive, you never get bored!\n\n",
          "Changing the current rules is never right. I bought the tickets before June 1 (where it says 2 days free) why I should pay another 3 euros x The 2nd day. Shame on you!!!\n\n",
          "Nice place but shame about the heavy rules. If you are not taller than 1.40, they will not let you do anything. In my opinion if you don't lower the height of how high one must be, it's just a waste of money \u2026",
          "I hadn't been there for years .... But as always the water fan never disappoints.\nI was on the games all day already at 10:15 am The beds were finished and I preferred to put things in the lockers. Very long files for \u2026",
          "Beautiful .. a well-organized water park..different swimming pools and slides .. attention however to children under the meter and 40, they cannot do all the attractions .. that's why they pay reduced..beautiful the \u2026",
          "One great negative note Maxi Wave.\nA BUFFALO created for advertising purposes, truly a troiaio !!! Take advantage of the hours of 14:30 x to the slides that will be empty.\nSorry even more so seeing that Rudy Zerbi is \u2026",
          "PESSIMA EXPERIENCE, at 6.30 pm they started literally throwing people out of the park, even knocking on the doors of showers and dressing rooms to urge people interested to do faster using an arrogant and somewhat \u2026",
          "Unfortunately I have to give a star for the reason of the rescues, we were very little inside, a friend of mine dislocates his shoulder and they took very long to help him, I thank the staff member who accompanied us \u2026",
          "By now it is a fixed stop in the summer, I always go there in June when it is not very crowded and you can do all the games without running into kilometers. Although my children (and I) always have a lot of fun this \u2026",
          "Beautiful playground suitable for children and teenagers ... Well organized and followed by the staff.\nVery pleasant days pass between games and the umbrella ... Wonderful day to spend with the family.\n\n",
          "One of the most beautiful water parks in Europe. Big enough to guarantee continuous fun while hosting thousands of people. Visited on August 16, for two slides only we did 45-60 minutes of queue. For the rest 10-15 \u2026",
          "I found the park very distracting and I spent the majority of my stay making lines and walking from one slide to the other. I found it ridiculous that you had to queue to get the boat and then make a second row to \u2026",
          "If you go on holiday in Riccione, a day at the Aquafun is a must. It doesn't matter how old you are. There are so many pools for all ages. I, who am \"big\", love the pool with the waves and the highest slides. \u2026",
          "Overpriced not too exciting experience\n\n",
          "I had a wonderful day of fun with my family.\nThere are attractions of all levels, from the most adrenaline to the softest.\nMany slides for children too.\nMore care should be taken of parking, since you pay it should \u2026",
          "I go back there after three years and it is always beautiful for adults and children. Only that sun beds and umbrellas are paid and to return a second time you pay 3 euros. But they can stay there ..\n\n",
          "ALWAYS the TOP !!! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\n\n",
          "Beautiful water park, I come here every year. In my opinion it is one of the most beautiful because it offers different pools for all tastes, both for small and large.\nHere you can find the wave pool Slides of all \u2026",
          "Bellissimo.parco water for the whole family! Having a 4 and a half year old child we were pleasantly surprised because there are so many attractions with shallow tubs specially for the little ones !!! Very nice \u2026",
          "In this period it is closed but it is a very large and well equipped amusement park\n\n",
          "Beautiful park, lots of space and lots of different types of attractions!\nFew promotions for entry, between one thing and another less than \u20ac 28 you do not spend and for a water park is not little.\nNot recommended in \u2026",
          "Don't go to this park on the last Sunday of June because there is the \"Summer party\" and practically you can't do almost any slide, even the children have to make rows that are really tiring! This party is not \u2026",
          "In short .. The park is always beautiful, for adults but for children between 110cm and 140cm the games have decreased in number and the waves of the pool are reduced, changed after the tragic accident of \u2026",
          "It will be the age that is no longer that of summers on the Riviera but this place in some ways mythical has not thrilled me at all. Exorbitant price, almost offensive. 30 \u20ac adult, 21 under 140cm.Parcheggio \u2026",
          "He lost the verve of the past but the structure is still worth a lot. A day of pure fun provided you don't find endless things. The internal refreshment points cost a lot in relation to the quality, better to equip \u2026",
          "Compared to previous years, I have found a lot of deterioration. Increased the price and the second day you do not enter for free but you need to pay 3 euros. Missing the music and the shows they did during the \u2026",
          "Ideal place for both small and large with different attractions based on water slides. Several swimming pools with umbrellas and a discreet green expanse to lie down and rest after lunch. Availability of pizzeria, \u2026",
          "Summer, sun and fun, a place suitable for families and full of entertainment. Very well organized, clean and functional. The only drawback is the long queues for the most reckless slides\n\n",
          "Very nice aquafan we went with my friends we had a lot of fun with the slides.\n\n",
          "I had a great time, at first I was afraid of climbing on the highest slides, then in the end I made them all, I asked for the slide because it is what gave me the most adrenaline, instead the slide that I expected was \u2026",
          "It is the water park par excellence, the slides are a must do for my children, they had a lot of fun in the pools for the little ones, even our parents are not sorry at all, to do absolutely the pool with the giant \u2026",
          "I really enjoyed this water park, despite having gone during a very busy period the rows to make the slides were quite long. The attractions are well done, very funny and the park is very well maintained, well \u2026",
          "Accompanying the children, Mah, I find him boring. Now then it is also all for a fee. All 5 euros parking, cots, if you join the 30 per person for entry it is easy for a family to spend between 150 and 200 euros \u2026",
          "I was in this park twenty years ago 'today I find the same wooden locker room and the same showers, what has changed? ..... entrance \u20ac 34 parking \u20ac 5 two boxes for backpacks \u20ac 4 each, but if you want be a family with \u2026",
          "Beautiful, fun, qualified lifeguards and attentive with swimmers ready to rush to the aid to the minimum even really sure difficulty x children .. Beware .. Because only the height under 140cm you can do a few slides! \u2026",
          "The swimming pool lifeguard very rude to the information office after paying the umbrella told me it was not a problem to add a cot instead the lifeguard answered me only for emergency: what does that mean.? Well \u2026",
          "Aquafan is truly one of the most beautiful water parks in Italy! Innovative and adrenaline slides. The only flaw: too much row (which obviously cannot be avoided) and the cost! You pay for everything. Already the \u2026",
          "Efficient, nothing is missing.\nYou have room to lie down or get-together equipped to eat while sitting.\nObviously there is all the rest of the fun !!\n\n",
          "Water park with different kind of slides for boys and younger children. Definitely a cult for youngsters. Well maintained and with many facilities to spend a nice day between pools and water games.\n\n",
          "Pretty quiet slides apart from the extreme River which is hilarious. The only flaw? There is an excellent sound system, they are sponsored by Deejay radio and you find yourself almost all the time without music and \u2026",
          "One of the most beautiful water parks in Italy. Attractions for all ages, slides for children, for large, foam parties and giant wave pool! Highly recommended to spend a nice day of fun\n\n",
          "It gets 5 stars from our athletes.\n\n",
          "An interesting leisure. The price was certainly not low, but also a lot of advantages. Prices in the area are adequate. There is a very good service, which allows people to visit the water park for 3 \u20ac, one more day \u2026",
          "Well-built park.\nThere are attractions for everyone for the little ones and the big ones.\nThe only flaw is the bathrooms are not cleaned at all especially with the overcrowding on Saturday and Sunday.\nThe swimming \u2026"

          "A bit expensive but nice. Okay, not as great as the aquarium in Dingle or Bray (Ireland), but they have many different see creatures. No dolphins!\nMany parking spaces, costs 5 euros in 2020.",
          "Very nice and clean place, the animal seems very well kept and fed, they inform people about pollution and  share some projects to save the wildlife, which is a great positive for me, completely worth it",
          "Great for kids, a lot to see. The reptile exhibition was a bit squished but everything else was well laid out. Also a pesce azzurro restaurant there where you can eat decent seafood and fish for low prices. \nNot a lot of wheelchair access so taking around the stroller means having to lift it up and down the stairs.",
          "Aside from the \"blue gallery\" it doesn't have many other attractive features. It has a stunning selection of really beautiful fishes to look upon and the \"pet the fish\" zone is really funny. Hope to see it expand in the future, especially \u2026",
          "Nice idea. Big public area. Maybe a little too dispersive. Nice place for kids. The restaurant incredibly packed with people.",
          "Giant sharks were alone worth it, but other creatures were also very interesting. Warning: huge queues for tickets and to enter aquarium on rainy days. Better buy a ticket in your hotel if they offer it.",
          "Our baby likes to go there and enjoy the shark tank and the crocodile as well.\nThe animals are in good condition even if some of them, in my opinion, do not have enough space (like the crocodile).\nUnfortunately to pass from a sector to \u2026",
          "Incredible.",
          "The day we went was bad weather and the place was packed with people. I think it is over priced for what it is but was not bad. I have been to better ones but the kids enjoyed it.",

The reasoj why it gets a 3 star rating though, is because the queues are always sooo long which is mostly due to the bad organisation skills of the workers. All in all though, it is a beautiful aquarium as long as you arrive an queue in the morning.",
          "The best for young kids for older nothing much to do. Although a lot of places to sit and relax.",

          "Good variety of different animals",
          "Not really bad, but still rather poor, especially for the price. The sharks are okay, the other areas are small and the mammals part literally non-existent. 3 stars at most. \nI can recommend it for adults and especially for nature enthusiasts. Not really good for families with small children.",

          "Kind of rubbish place. I've been literally robbed: 70 euros for 2 adults and 2 children, when something like this is in the UK would not cost more than \u00a335 with a family ticket.\nThe place is for most of its part inaccessible to impaired and \u2026",

          "I expected more animals and less people.",

          "Quite worm down but nice selection of animals",
          "Lots of fish and snakes and insects. It's expensive. The buildings are old and have way too many stairs and are not disabled person friendly at all. I'd say visit here if you've run out of things to do with the kids and really need to find some entertainment for them. ",

          "Nice aquarium, although I liked it better a few years ago with the part dedicated to the history of ships. Fantastic stage to spend an afternoon other than sun-sea-beach. Excellent park for picnics and play area \u2026",
          "We weren't really close to the place: we took an hour to get there but it was really worth it. The aquarium is beautiful. The division into pavilions is a magnificent idea: it allows you to take breaks between one \u2026",

        "wiki": "The Dominican Republic ( d\u0259-MIN-ik-\u0259n; Spanish: Rep\u00fablica Dominicana, pronounced [re\u02c8pu\u03b2lika \u00f0omini\u02c8kana] (listen)) is a country located on the island of Hispaniola in the Greater Antilles archipelago of the Caribbean region. It occupies the eastern five-eighths of the island, which it shares with Haiti, making Hispaniola one of only two Caribbean islands, along with Saint Martin, that are shared by two sovereign states. The Dominican Republic is the second-largest nation in the Antilles by area (after Cuba) at 48,671 square kilometers (18,792 sq mi), and third by population with approximately 10.5 million people (2020 est.), of whom approximately 3.3 million live in the metropolitan area of Santo Domingo, the capital city. The official language of the country is Spanish.\nThe native Ta\u00edno people had inhabited Hispaniola before the arrival of the Europeans, dividing it into five chiefdoms. The Ta\u00edno people had eventually moved north over many years, and lived around the Caribbean islands. The Ta\u00edno natives had done quite well for themselves and were on their way to being an organized civilization. Christopher Columbus explored and claimed the island, landing here on his first voyage in 1492. The colony of Santo Domingo became the site of the first permanent European settlement in the Americas, the oldest continuously inhabited city, and the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the New World. Meanwhile, France occupied the western third of Hispaniola, naming their colony Saint-Domingue, which became the independent state of Haiti in 1804. After more than three hundred years of Spanish rule the Dominican people declared independence in November 1821. The leader of the independence movement Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres, intended the Dominican nation to unite with the country of Gran Colombia, but the newly independent Dominicans were forcefully annexed by Haiti in February 1822. Independence came 22 years later in 1844, after victory in the Dominican War of Independence. Over the next 72 years the Dominican Republic experienced mostly internal conflicts and a brief return to Spanish colonial status before permanently ousting the Spanish during the Dominican War of Restoration of 1863\u20131865. The United States occupied the country between 1916 and 1924; a subsequent calm and prosperous six-year period under Horacio V\u00e1squez followed. From 1930 the dictatorship of Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo ruled until 1961. A civil war in 1965, the country's last, was ended by U.S. military occupation and was followed by the authoritarian rule of Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer (1966\u20131978 and 1986\u20131996). Since 1978 the Dominican Republic has moved toward representative democracy. Danilo Medina, the Dominican Republic's current president, succeeded Fern\u00e1ndez in 2012, winning 51% of the electoral vote over his opponent ex-president Hip\u00f3lito Mej\u00eda.\nThe Dominican Republic has the largest economy in the Caribbean and Central American region and is the eighth-largest economy in Latin America. Over the last 25 years, the Dominican Republic has had the fastest-growing economy in the Western Hemisphere \u2013 with an average real GDP growth rate of 5.3% between 1992 and 2018. GDP growth in 2014 and 2015 reached 7.3 and 7.0%, respectively, the highest in the Western Hemisphere. In the first half of 2016 the Dominican economy grew 7.4% continuing its trend of rapid economic growth. Recent growth has been driven by construction, manufacturing, tourism, and mining. The country is the site of the second largest gold mine in the world, the Pueblo Viejo mine. Private consumption has been strong, as a result of low inflation (under 1% on average in 2015), job creation, and a high level of remittances.\nThe Dominican Republic is the most visited destination in the Caribbean. The year-round golf courses are major attractions. A geographically diverse nation, the Dominican Republic is home to both the Caribbean's tallest mountain peak, Pico Duarte, and the Caribbean's largest lake and point of lowest elevation, Lake Enriquillo. The island has an average temperature of 26 \u00b0C (78.8 \u00b0F) and great climatic and biological diversity. The country is also the site of the first cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress built in the Americas, located in Santo Domingo's Colonial Zone, a World Heritage Site. Music and sport are of great importance in the Dominican culture, with Merengue and Bachata as the national dance and music, and baseball as the most popular sport.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe \"Dominican\" word comes from the Latin Dominicus, meaning Sunday. However, the island has this name by Santo Domingo de Guzm\u00e1n (Saint Dominic), founder of the Order of the Dominicans.The Dominicans established a house of high studies in the island of Santo Domingo that today is known as the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Santo Domingo and dedicated themselves to the protection of the native Ta\u00edno people, who were subjected to slavery, and to the education of the inhabitants of the island.For most of its history, up until independence, the country was known as Santo Domingo \u2013 the name of its present capital and patron saint, Saint Dominic \u2013 and continued to be commonly known as such in English until the early 20th century.  The residents were called \"Dominicans\" (Dominicanos), the adjectival form of \"Domingo\", and the revolutionaries named their newly independent country \"Dominican Republic\" (Rep\u00fablica Dominicana).\nIn the national anthem of the Dominican Republic (himno nacional de la Rep\u00fablica Dominicana), the term \"Dominicans\" does not appear. The author of its lyrics, Emilio Prud'Homme, consistently uses the poetic term \"Quisqueyans\" (Quisqueyanos). The word \"Quisqueya\" derives from a native tongue of the Ta\u00edno Indians and means \"Mother of the lands\" (Madre de las tierras). It is often used in songs as another name for the country. The name of the country is often shortened to \"the D.R.\" (la R.D.)\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-European history ===\n\nThe Arawakan-speaking Ta\u00edno moved into Hispaniola from the north east region of what is now known as South America, displacing earlier inhabitants, c. 650 C.E. They engaged in farming and fishing and hunting and gathering. The fierce Caribs drove the Ta\u00edno to the northeastern Caribbean during much of the 15th century. The estimates of Hispaniola's population in 1492 vary widely, including one hundred thousand, three hundred thousand, and four hundred thousand to two million. Determining precisely how many people lived on the island in pre-Columbian times is next to impossible, as no accurate records exist. By 1492 the island was divided into five Ta\u00edno chiefdoms. The Ta\u00edno name for the entire island was either Ayiti or Quisqueya.The Spaniards arrived in 1492. After initially friendly relationships, the Ta\u00ednos resisted the conquest, led by the female Chief Anacaona of Xaragua and her ex-husband Chief Caonabo of Maguana, as well as Chiefs Guacanagar\u00edx, Guam\u00e1, Hatuey, and Enriquillo. The latter's successes gained his people an autonomous enclave for a time on the island. Within a few years after 1492, the population of Ta\u00ednos had declined drastically, due to smallpox, measles, and other diseases that arrived with the Europeans, and from other causes discussed below.\nThe first recorded smallpox outbreak in the Americas occurred on Hispaniola in 1507. The last record of pure Ta\u00ednos in the country was from 1864. Still, Ta\u00edno biological heritage survived to an important extent, due to intermixing. Census records from 1514 reveal that 40% of Spanish men in Santo Domingo were married to Taino women, and some present-day Dominicans have Ta\u00edno ancestry. Remnants of the Taino culture include their cave paintings, (including the Pomier Caves) as well as pottery designs which are still used in the small artisan village of Hig\u00fcerito, Moca.\n\n\n=== European colonization ===\n\nChristopher Columbus arrived on the island on December 5, 1492, during the first of his four voyages to the Americas. He claimed the land for Spain and named it La Espa\u00f1ola due to its diverse climate and terrain which reminded him of the Spanish landscape. Traveling further east Columbus came across the Yaque del Norte River in the Cibao region, which he named Rio de Oro after discovering gold deposits nearby. On Columbus's return during his second voyage he established the settlement of La Isabela in what is now Puerto Plata on Jan. 1494, while he sent Alonso de Ojeda to search for gold in the region.\nIn 1496 Bartholomew Columbus, Christopher's brother, built the city of Santo Domingo, Western Europe's first permanent settlement in the \"New World.\" The colony thus became the springboard for the further Spanish conquest of the Americas and for decades the headquarters of Spanish colonial power in the hemisphere. Soon after the largest discovery of gold in the island was made in the cordillera central region, which led to a mining boom. By 1501, Columbus's cousin Giovanni Columbus, had also discovered gold near Buenaventura, the deposits were later known as Minas Nuevas. Two major mining areas resulted, one along San Crist\u00f3bal-Buenaventura, and another in Cibao within the La Vega-Cotuy-Bonao triangle, while Santiago de los Caballeros, Concepcion, and Bonao became mining towns.  The gold rush of 1500\u20131508 ensued. Ferdinand II of Aragon \"ordered gold from the richest mines reserved for the Crown.\" Thus, Ovando expropriated the gold mines of Miguel Diaz and Francisco de Garay in 1504, as pit mines became royal mines, though placers were open to private prospectors. Furthermore, Ferdinand wanted the \"best Indians\" working his royal mines, and kept 967 in the San Crist\u00f3bal mining area supervised by salaried miners.Under Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando y C\u00e1ceres' governorship, the Indians were made to work in the gold mines, \"where they were grossly overworked, mistreated, and underfed,\" according to Pons.  By 1503, the Spanish Crown legalized the distribution of Indians to work the mines as part of the encomienda system.  According to Pons, \"Once the Indians entered the mines, hunger and disease literally wiped them out.\"  By 1508 the Indian population of about 400,000 was reduced to 60,000, and by 1514, only 26,334 remained.  About half were located in the mining towns of Concepci\u00f3n, Santiago, Santo Domingo, and Buenaventura.  The repartimiento of 1514 accelerated emigration of the Spanish colonists, coupled with the exhaustion of the mines. In 1516, a smallpox epidemic killed an additional 8,000, of the remaining 11,000 Indians, in one month.  By 1519, according to Pons, \"Both the gold economy and the Indian population became extinct at the same time.\"The southern city of Santo Domingo served as the administrative heart of the expanding Spanish empire. Conquistadors like Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and Francisco Pizarro lived and worked in Santo Domingo before they embarked on their prosperous endeavors in the American continent. Sugar cane was introduced to Hispaniola from the Canary Islands, and the first sugar mill in the New World was established in 1516, on Hispaniola. The need for a labor force to meet the growing demands of sugar cane cultivation led to an exponential increase in the importation of slaves over the following two decades. The sugar mill owners soon formed a new colonial elite and convinced the Spanish king to allow them to elect the members of the Real Audiencia from their ranks. Poorer colonists subsisted by hunting the herds of wild cattle that roamed throughout the island and selling their leather.\nIn the 1560s English pirates joined the French in regularly raiding Spanish shipping in the Americas. With the conquest of the American mainland, Hispaniola's sugar plantation economy quickly declined. Most Spanish colonists left for the silver-mines of Mexico and Peru, while new immigrants from Spain bypassed the island. Agriculture dwindled, new imports of slaves ceased, and white colonists, free people of color, and slaves lived in similar conditions, weakening the racial hierarchy and aiding intermixing, resulting in a population of predominantly mixed Spaniard, Taino, and African descent. Except for the city of Santo Domingo, which managed to maintain some legal exports, Dominican ports were forced to rely on contraband trade, which, along with livestock, became one of the main sources of livelihood for the island's inhabitants.\nBy the mid-17th century the French sent colonists and privateers to settle the northwestern coast of Hispaniola due to its strategic position in the region. In order to entice the pirates, the French supplied them with women who had been taken from prisons, accused of prostitution and thieving. After decades of armed struggles with the French, Spain ceded the western coast of the island to France with the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick, whilst the Central Plateau remained under Spanish domain. France created a wealthy colony in the island, while the Spanish colony continued to suffer an economic decline.On April 17, 1655, the English landed on nearby Hispaniola and marched 30 miles overland to Santo Domingo, the main Spanish stronghold on the island. The sweltering heat soon felled many of the northern European invaders. The Spanish defenders, having had time to prepare an ambush for the aimlessly thrashing, mosquito-swatting newcomers, sprang on them with mounted lancers, sending them careening back toward the beach in utter confusion. Their commander, Venables, hid behind a tree where, in the words of one disgusted observer, he was \u201cso much possessed with terror that he could hardly speak.\u201d The elite defenders of Santo Domingo were amply rewarded with titles from the Spanish Crown.\nThe French attacked Santiago in 1667, and this was followed by a devastating hurricane the next year and a smallpox epidemic that killed about 1,500 in 1669. In 1687, the Spaniards captured the fort at Petit-Goave, but the French fought back and hanged their leaders. Two years later Louis XIV was at war and ordered the French to invade the Spaniards, and Tarin de Cussy sacked Santiago. In 1691, the Spaniards attacked the north and sacked Cap-Fran\u00e7ois. Island tensions subsided once peace was restored and Spain's last Habsburg monarch\u2014the deformed invalid Charles II\u2014died on 30 November 1700, being succeeded by the sixteen-year-old French Bourbon princeling Philip of Anjou.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\nThe House of Bourbon replaced the House of Habsburg in Spain in 1700 and introduced economic reforms that gradually began to revive trade in Santo Domingo. The crown progressively relaxed the rigid controls and restrictions on commerce between Spain and the colonies and among the colonies. The last flotas sailed in 1737; the monopoly port system was abolished shortly thereafter. By the middle of the century, the population was bolstered by the emigration of Spaniards from the Canary Islands, resettling the northern part of the colony and planting tobacco in the Cibao Valley, and importation of slaves was renewed. The colony of Santo Domingo saw a population increase during the 18th century, as it rose to about 91,272 in 1750. Of this number approximately 38,272 were white landowners, 38,000 were free mixed people of color, and some 15,000 were slaves. This contrasted sharply with the population of the French colony of Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti) \u2013 the wealthiest colony in the Caribbean and whose population of one-half a million was 90% enslaved and overall seven times as numerous as the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo. The 'Spanish' settlers, whose blood by now was mixed with that of Tainos, Africans and Canary Guanches, proclaimed: 'It does not matter if the French are richer than us, we are still the true inheritors of this island. In our veins runs the blood of the heroic conquistadores who won this island of ours with sword and blood.'\n\nWhen the War of Jenkins' Ear between Spain and Britain broke out in 1739, Spanish privateers, particularly from Santo Domingo, began to troll the Caribbean Sea, a development that lasted until the end of the eighteenth century. During this period, Spanish privateers from Santo Domingo sailed into enemy ports looking for ships to plunder, thus harming commerce with Britain and New York. As a result, the Spanish obtained stolen merchandise\u2014foodstuffs, ships, enslaved persons\u2014that were sold in Hispaniola's ports, with profits accruing to individual sea raiders. The revenue acquired in these acts of piracy was invested in the economic expansion of the colony and led to repopulation from Europe. As restrictions on colonial trade were relaxed, the colonial elites of St. Domingue offered the principal market for Santo Domingo's exports of beef, hides, mahogany, and tobacco. With the outbreak of the Haitian Revolution in 1791, the rich urban families linked to the colonial bureaucracy fled the island, while most of the rural hateros (cattle ranchers) remained, even though they lost their principal market. Although the population of Spanish Santo Domingo was perhaps one-fourth that of French Saint-Domingue, this did not prevent the Spanish king from launching an invasion of the French side of the island in 1793, attempting to take advantage of the chaos sparked by the French Revolution. French forces checked Spanish progress toward Port-au-Prince in the south, but the Spanish pushed rapidly through the north, most of which they occupied by 1794.\nAlthough the Spanish military effort went well on Hispaniola, it did not so in Europe (see War of the Pyrenees). As a consequence, Spain was forced to cede Santo Domingo to the French under the terms of the Treaty of Basel (July 22, 1795) in order to get the French to withdraw from Spain.\n\n\n=== French rule ===\n\nFrom 1795 to 1822, Santo Domingo (the city) changed hands several times along with the colony it headed. It was ceded to France in 1795 after years of struggles. However, the French failed to consolidate this cession, mainly because of the continued presence of British troops in Saint-Domingue (they remained there until 1798). As the news of Santo Domingo's cession became known on the island, many Dominicans had sided with Britain against France, welcoming British ships into their ports, pledging allegiance to the British and enlisting in the military forces of France's longtime opponent.In 1801, Toussaint Louverture, who at least in theory represented imperial France, marched into Santo Domingo from Saint-Domingue to enforce the terms of the Treaty of Basel. Toussaint's army committed numerous atrocities; as a consequence, the Spanish population fled from Santo Domingo in exodus proportions. French control of the former Spanish colony passed from Toussaint Louverture to Gen. Charles Leclerc when he seized the city of Santo Domingo in early 1802. Following the defeat of the French under Gen. Donatien de Rochembeau at Le Cap in November 1803 by the Haitians, their new leader, Dessalines, attempted to drive the French out of Santo Domingo. He invaded the Spanish side of the island, defeated the French-led Spanish colonials at River Yaque del Sur, and besieged the capital on March 5, 1805. At the same time, the Haitian General Christophe marched north through Cibao, capturing Santiago where he massacred prominent individuals who had sought refuge in a church. The arrival of small French squadrons off the Haitian coast at Goncaives and at Santo Domingo forced the Haitians to withdraw. As Christophe retreated across the island, he slaughtered and burned. In October 1808 the landowner Juan S\u00e1nchez Ram\u00edrez began a rebellion against the French colonial government in Santo Domingo and the insurgents were aided by Puerto Rico and Jamaica. A combined Anglo-Spanish force recaptured the territory in 1809. The Spaniards, upon re-establishing control, not only tried to re-establish slavery in Santo Domingo, but many of them also mounted raiding expeditions into Haiti to capture blacks and enslave them as well.\n\n\n=== Independence from Spain (1821) ===\n\nAfter a dozen years of discontent and failed independence plots by various opposing groups, Santo Domingo's former Lieutenant-Governor (top administrator), Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres, declared the colony's independence from the Spanish crown as Spanish Haiti, on November 30, 1821. This period is also known as the Ephemeral independence.\n\n\n=== Unification of Hispaniola (1822\u201344) ===\n\nThe newly independent republic ended two months later under the Haitian government led by Jean-Pierre Boyer.As Toussaint Louverture had done two decades earlier, the Haitians abolished slavery. In order to raise funds for the huge indemnity of 150 million francs that Haiti agreed to pay the former French colonists, and which was subsequently lowered to 60 million francs, the Haitian government imposed heavy taxes on the Dominicans. Since Haiti was unable to adequately provision its army, the occupying forces largely survived by commandeering or confiscating food and supplies at gunpoint. Attempts to redistribute land conflicted with the system of communal land tenure (terrenos comuneros), which had arisen with the ranching economy, and some people resented being forced to grow cash crops under Boyer and Joseph Balthazar Inginac's Code Rural. In the rural and rugged mountainous areas, the Haitian administration was usually too inefficient to enforce its own laws. It was in the city of Santo Domingo that the effects of the occupation were most acutely felt, and it was there that the movement for independence originated.\nThe Haitians associated the Roman Catholic Church with the French slave-masters who had exploited them before independence and confiscated all church property, deported all foreign clergy, and severed the ties of the remaining clergy to the Vatican. All levels of education collapsed; the university was shut down, as it was starved both of resources and students, with young Dominican men from 16 to 25 years old being drafted into the Haitian army. Boyer's occupation troops, who were largely Dominicans, were unpaid and had to \"forage and sack\" from Dominican civilians. Haiti imposed a \"heavy tribute\" on the Dominican people.Haiti's constitution forbade white elites from owning land, and Dominican major landowning families were forcibly deprived of their properties. During this time, many white elites in Santo Domingo did not consider owning slaves due to the economic crisis that Santo Domingo faced during the Espa\u00f1a Boba period. The few landowners that wanted slavery established in Santo Domingo had to emigrate to other colonies such as Cuba, Puerto Rico, or Gran Colombia. Many landowning families stayed on the island, with a heavy concentration of landowners settling in the cibao region. After independence, and eventually being under Spanish rule once again in 1861, many families returned to Santo Domingo including new waves of immigration from Spain.\n\n\n=== Dominican War of Independence (1844) ===\n\nIn 1838, Juan Pablo Duarte founded a secret society called La Trinitaria, which sought the complete independence of Santo Domingo without any foreign intervention. Also Francisco del Rosario S\u00e1nchez and Ramon Matias Mella, despite not being among the founding members of La Trinitaria, were decisive in the fight for independence. Duarte, Mella, and S\u00e1nchez are considered the three Founding Fathers of the Dominican Republic.The Trinitarios took advantage of a Haitian rebellion against the dictator Jean-Pierre Boyer. They rose up on January 27, 1843, ostensibly in support of the Haitian Charles H\u00e9rard who was challenging Boyer for the control of Haiti. However, the movement soon discarded its pretext of support for H\u00e9rard and now championed Dominican independence. After overthrowing Boyer, H\u00e9rard executed some Dominicans, and threw many others into prison; Duarte escaped. After subduing the Dominicans, H\u00e9rard, a mulatto, faced a rebellion by blacks in Port-au-Prince. Haiti had formed two regiments composed of Dominicans from the city of Santo Domingo; these were used by H\u00e9rard to suppress the uprising.\n\nOn February 27, 1844, the surviving members of La Trinitaria declared the independence from Haiti. They were backed by Pedro Santana, a wealthy cattle rancher from El Seibo, who became general of the army of the nascent republic. The Dominican Republic's first Constitution was adopted on November 6, 1844, and was modeled after the United States Constitution. The decades that followed were filled with tyranny, factionalism, economic difficulties, rapid changes of government, and exile for political opponents. Archrivals Santana and Buenaventura B\u00e1ez held power most of the time, both ruling arbitrarily. They promoted competing plans to annex the new nation to another power: Santana favored Spain, and B\u00e1ez the United States.\nThreatening the nation's independence were renewed Haitian invasions. On 19 March 1844, the Haitian Army, under the personal command of President H\u00e9rard, invaded the eastern province from the north and progressed as far as Santiago, but was soon forced to withdraw after suffering disproportionate losses. According to Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Imbert's (the General defending Santiago) report of April 5, 1844 to Santo Domingo, \u201cin Santiago, the enemy did not leave behind in the battlefield less than six hundred dead and\u2026the number of wounded was very superior\u2026[while on] our part we suffered not one casualty.\u201dThe Dominicans repelled the Haitian forces, on both land and sea, by December 1845. The Haitians invaded again in 1849 after France recognized the Dominican Republic as an independent nation. In an overwhelming onslaught, the Haitians seized one frontier town after another. Santana being called upon to assume command of the troops, met the enemy at Ocoa, April 21, 1849, with only 400 men, and succeeded in utterly defeating the Haitian army. In November 1849 B\u00e1ez launched a naval offensive against Haiti to forestall the threat of another invasion. His seamen under the French adventurer, Fagalde, raided the Haitian coasts, plundered seaside villages, as far as Cape Dame Marie, and butchered crews of captured enemy ships. In 1855, Haiti invaded again, but its forces were repulsed at the bloodiest clashes in the history of the Dominican\u2013Haitian wars, the Battle of Santom\u00e9 in December 1855 and the Battle of Sabana Larga in January 1856.\n\n\n=== First Republic ===\n\nThe Dominican Republic's first constitution was adopted on November 6, 1844. The state was commonly known as Santo Domingo in English until the early 20th century.  It featured a presidential form of government with many liberal tendencies, but it was marred by Article 210, imposed by Pedro Santana on the constitutional assembly by force, giving him the privileges of a dictatorship until the war of independence was over. These privileges not only served him to win the war but also allowed him to persecute, execute and drive into exile his political opponents, among which Duarte was the most important. In Haiti after the fall of Boyer, black leaders had ascended to the power once enjoyed exclusively by the mulatto elite.Without adequate roads, the regions of the Dominican Republic developed in isolation from one another. In the south, also known at the time as Ozama, the economy was dominated by cattle-ranching (particularly in the southeastern savannah) and cutting mahogany and other hardwoods for export. This region retained a semi-feudal character, with little commercial agriculture, the hacienda as the dominant social unit, and the majority of the population living at a subsistence level. In the north (better-known as Cibao), the nation's richest farmland, peasants supplemented their subsistence crops by growing tobacco for export, mainly to Germany. Tobacco required less land than cattle ranching and was mainly grown by smallholders, who relied on itinerant traders to transport their crops to Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi. Santana antagonized the Cibao farmers, enriching himself and his supporters at their expense by resorting to multiple peso printings that allowed him to buy their crops for a fraction of their value. In 1848, he was forced to resign and was succeeded by his vice-president, Manuel Jimenes.\nAfter defeating a new Haitian invasion in 1849, Santana marched on Santo Domingo and deposed Jimenes in a coup d'\u00e9tat. At his behest, Congress elected Buenaventura B\u00e1ez as President, but B\u00e1ez was unwilling to serve as Santana's puppet, challenging his role as the country's acknowledged military leader. In 1853, Santana was elected president for his second term, forcing B\u00e1ez into exile. Three years later, after repulsing another Haitian invasion, he negotiated a treaty leasing a portion of Saman\u00e1 Peninsula to a U.S. company; popular opposition forced him to abdicate, enabling B\u00e1ez to return and seize power. With the treasury depleted, B\u00e1ez printed eighteen million uninsured pesos, purchasing the 1857 tobacco crop with this currency and exporting it for hard cash at immense profit to himself and his followers. Cibao tobacco planters, who were ruined when hyperinflation ensued, revolted and formed a new government headed by Jos\u00e9 Desiderio Valverde and headquartered in Santiago de los Caballeros. In July 1857 General Juan Luis Franco Bid\u00f3 besieged Santo Domingo. The Cibao-based government declared an amnesty to exiles and Santana returned and managed to replace Franco Bid\u00f3 in September 1857. After a year of civil war, Santana captured Santo Domingo in June 1858, overthrew both B\u00e1ez and Valverde and installed himself as president.\n\n\n=== Restoration republic ===\n\nIn 1861, after imprisoning, silencing, exiling, and executing many of his opponents and due to political and economic reasons, Santana signed a pact with the Spanish Crown and reverted the Dominican nation to colonial status. This action was supported by the cattlemen of the south while the northern elites opposed it. Spanish rule finally came to an end with the War of Restoration in 1865, after four years of conflict between Dominican nationalists and Spanish sympathizers. The war claimed more than 50,000 lives.Political strife again prevailed in the following years; warlords ruled, military revolts were extremely common, and the nation amassed debt. In 1869, President Ulysses S. Grant ordered U.S. Marines to the island for the first time. Pirates operating from Haiti had been raiding U.S. commercial shipping in the Caribbean, and Grant directed the Marines to stop them at their source. Following the virtual takeover of the island, B\u00e1ez offered to sell the country to the United States. Grant desired a naval base at Saman\u00e1 and also a place for resettling newly freed Blacks. The treaty, which included U.S. payment of $1.5 million for Dominican debt repayment, was defeated in the United States Senate in 1870 on a vote of 28\u201328, two-thirds being required.B\u00e1ez was toppled in 1874, returned, and was toppled for good in 1878. A new generation was thence in charge, with the passing of Santana (he died in 1864) and B\u00e1ez from the scene. Relative peace came to the country in the 1880s, which saw the coming to power of General Ulises Heureaux.\"Lil\u00eds\", as the new president was nicknamed, enjoyed a period of popularity. He was, however, \"a consummate dissembler\", who put the nation deep into debt while using much of the proceeds for his personal use and to maintain his police state. Heureaux became rampantly despotic and unpopular. In 1899, he was assassinated. However, the relative calm over which he presided allowed improvement in the Dominican economy. The sugar industry was modernized, and the country attracted foreign workers and immigrants.\n\n\n=== 20th century (1900\u201330) ===\n\nFrom 1902 on, short-lived governments were again the norm, with their power usurped by caudillos in parts of the country. Furthermore, the national government was bankrupt and, unable to pay Heureaux's debts, faced the threat of military intervention by France and other European creditor powers.United States President Theodore Roosevelt sought to prevent European intervention, largely to protect the routes to the future Panama Canal, as the canal was already under construction. He made a small military intervention to ward off European powers, to proclaim his famous Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, and also to obtain his 1905 Dominican agreement for U.S. administration of Dominican customs, which was the chief source of income for the Dominican government. A 1906 agreement provided for the arrangement to last 50 years. The United States agreed to use part of the customs proceeds to reduce the immense foreign debt of the Dominican Republic and assumed responsibility for said debt.\n\nAfter six years in power, President Ram\u00f3n C\u00e1ceres (who had himself assassinated Heureaux) was assassinated in 1911. The result was several years of great political instability and civil war. U.S. mediation by the William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson administrations achieved only a short respite each time. A political deadlock in 1914 was broken after an ultimatum by Wilson telling the Dominicans to choose a president or see the U.S. impose one. A provisional president was chosen, and later the same year relatively free elections put former president (1899\u20131902) Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra back in power. To achieve a more broadly supported government, Jimenes named opposition individuals to his cabinet. But this brought no peace and, with his former Secretary of War Desiderio Arias maneuvering to depose him and despite a U.S. offer of military aid against Arias, Jimenes resigned on May 7, 1916.\n\nWilson thus ordered the U.S. occupation of the Dominican Republic. U.S. Marines landed on May 16, 1916, and had control of the country two months later. The military government established by the U.S., led by Vice Admiral Harry Shepard Knapp, was widely repudiated by the Dominicans, with many factions within the country leading guerrilla campaigns against U.S. forces. The occupation regime kept most Dominican laws and institutions and largely pacified the general population. The occupying government also revived the Dominican economy, reduced the nation's debt, built a road network that at last interconnected all regions of the country, and created a professional National Guard to replace the warring partisan units.Vigorous opposition to the occupation continued, nevertheless, and after World War I it increased in the U.S. as well. There, President Warren G. Harding (1921\u201323), Wilson's successor, worked to put an end to the occupation, as he had promised to do during his campaign. The U.S. government's rule ended in October 1922, and elections were held in March 1924.\n\nThe victor was former president (1902\u201303) Horacio V\u00e1squez, who had cooperated with the U.S. He was inaugurated on July 13, and the last U.S. forces left in September. In six years, the Marines were involved in at least 467 engagements, with 950 insurgents killed or wounded in action. V\u00e1squez gave the country six years of stable governance, in which political and civil rights were respected and the economy grew strongly, in a relatively peaceful atmosphere.During the government of Horacio V\u00e1squez, Rafael Trujillo held the rank of lieutenant colonel and was chief of police. This position helped him launch his plans to overthrow the government of V\u00e1squez. Trujillo had the support of Carlos Rosario Pe\u00f1a, who formed the Civic Movement, which had as its main objective to overthrow the government of V\u00e1squez.\nIn February 1930, when V\u00e1squez attempted to win another term, his opponents rebelled in secret alliance with the commander of the National Army (the former National Guard), General Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina. Trujillo secretly cut a deal with rebel leader Rafael Estrella Ure\u00f1a; in return for letting Ure\u00f1a take power, Trujillo would be allowed to run for president in new elections. As the rebels marched toward Santo Domingo, V\u00e1squez ordered Trujillo to suppress them. However, feigning \"neutrality,\" Trujillo kept his men in barracks, allowing Ure\u00f1a's rebels to take the capital virtually uncontested. On March 3, Ure\u00f1a was proclaimed acting president with Trujillo confirmed as head of the police and the army.\nAs per their agreement, Trujillo became the presidential nominee of the newly formed Patriotic Coalition of Citizens (Spanish: Coalici\u00f3n patriotica de los ciudadanos), with Ure\u00f1a as his running mate. During the election campaign, Trujillo used the army to unleash his repression, forcing his opponents to withdraw from the race. Trujillo stood to elect himself, and in May he was elected president virtually unopposed after a violent campaign against his opponents, ascending to power on August 16, 1930.\n\n\n=== Trujillo Era (1930\u201361) ===\n\nThere was considerable economic growth during Rafael Trujillo's long and iron-fisted regime, although a great deal of the wealth was taken by the dictator and other regime elements. There was progress in healthcare, education, and transportation, with the building of hospitals and clinics, schools, and roads and harbors. Trujillo also carried out an important housing construction program and instituted a pension plan. He finally negotiated an undisputed border with Haiti in 1935 and achieved the end of the 50-year customs agreement in 1941, instead of 1956. He made the country debt-free in 1947.This was accompanied by absolute repression and the copious use of murder, torture, and terrorist methods against the opposition. Trujillo renamed Santo Domingo to \"Ciudad Trujillo\" (Trujillo City), the nation's \u2013 and the Caribbean's \u2013 highest mountain La Pelona Grande (Spanish for: The Great Bald) to \"Pico Trujillo\" (Spanish for: Trujillo Peak), and many towns and a province. Some other places he renamed after members of his family. By the end of his first term in 1934 he was the country's wealthiest person, and one of the wealthiest in the world by the early 1950s; near the end of his regime his fortune was an estimated $800 million. He used the secret police extensively to eliminate political opposition and to prevent several coup attempts during and after World War II. The secret police allegedly murdered more than 500,000 people during the Trujillo era.\nAlthough one-quarter Haitian, Trujillo promoted propaganda against them. In 1937, he ordered what became known as the Parsley Massacre or, in the Dominican Republic, as El Corte (The Cutting), directing the army to kill Haitians living on the Dominican side of the border. The army killed an estimated 17,000 to 35,000 Haitian men, women, and children over six days, from the night of October 2, 1937, through October 8, 1937. To avoid leaving evidence of the army's involvement, the soldiers used edged weapons rather than guns. The soldiers were said to have interrogated anyone with dark skin, using the shibboleth perejil (parsley) to distinguish Haitians from Afro-Dominicans when necessary; the 'r' of perejil was of difficult pronunciation for Haitians. As a result of the massacre, the Dominican Republic agreed to pay Haiti US$750,000, later reduced to US$525,000. In 1938, reports from the Dominican Republic revealed hundreds more Haitians had been killed and thousands deported.\nOn November 25, 1960, Trujillo killed three of the four Mirabal sisters, nicknamed Las Mariposas (The Butterflies). The victims were Patria Mercedes Mirabal (born on February 27, 1924), Argentina Minerva Mirabal (born on March 12, 1926), and Antonia Mar\u00eda Teresa Mirabal (born on October 15, 1935). Along with their husbands, the sisters were conspiring to overthrow Trujillo in a violent revolt. The Mirabals had communist ideological leanings as did their husbands. The sisters have received many honors posthumously and have many memorials in various cities in the Dominican Republic. Salcedo, their home province, changed its name to Provincia Hermanas Mirabal (Mirabal Sisters Province). The International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women is observed on the anniversary of their deaths.\nFor a long time, the U.S. and the Dominican elite supported the Trujillo government. This support persisted despite the assassinations of political opposition, the massacre of Haitians, and Trujillo's plots against other countries. The U.S. believed Trujillo was the lesser of two or more evils. The U.S. finally broke with Trujillo in 1960, after Trujillo's agents attempted to assassinate the Venezuelan president, R\u00f3mulo Betancourt, a fierce critic of Trujillo.Trujillo had become expendable. Dissidents inside the Dominican Republic argued that assassination was the only certain way to remove Trujillo.According to Chester Bowles, the U.S. Undersecretary of State, internal Department of State discussions in 1961 on the topic were vigorous. Richard N. Goodwin, Assistant Special Counsel to the President, who had direct contacts with the rebel alliance, argued for intervention against Trujillo. Quoting Bowles directly: The next morning I learned that in spite of the clear decision against having the dissident group request our assistance Dick Goodwin following the meeting sent a cable to CIA people in the Dominican Republic without checking with State or CIA; indeed, with the protest of the Department of State. The cable directed the CIA people in the Dominican Republic to get this request at any cost. When Allen Dulles found this out the next morning, he withdrew the order. We later discovered it had already been carried out.\n\n\n=== Post-Trujillo (1962\u20131996) ===\n\nTrujillo was assassinated on May 30, 1961 with weapons supplied by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).In February 1963, a democratically elected government under leftist Juan Bosch took office but it was overthrown in September. On April 24, 1965, after 19 months of military rule, a pro-Bosch revolt broke out.Days later U.S. President Lyndon Johnson, concerned that Communists might take over the revolt and create a \"second Cuba,\" sent the Marines, followed immediately by the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division and other elements of the XVIIIth Airborne Corps, in Operation Powerpack. \"We don't propose to sit here in a rocking chair with our hands folded and let the Communist set up any government in the western hemisphere,\" Johnson said. The forces were soon joined by comparatively small contingents from the Organization of American States. All these remained in the country for over a year and left after supervising elections in 1966 won by Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer. He had been Trujillo's last puppet-president.\n\nThe Dominican death toll for the entire period of civil war and occupation totaled more than three thousand, many of them black civilians killed when the US-backed military junta engaged in a campaign of ethnic cleansing in the northern (also the industrial) part of Santo Domingo.Balaguer remained in power as president for 12 years. His tenure was a period of repression of human rights and civil liberties, ostensibly to keep pro-Castro or pro-communist parties out of power; 11,000 persons were killed. His rule was criticized for a growing disparity between rich and poor. It was, however, praised for an ambitious infrastructure program, which included the construction of large housing projects, sports complexes, theaters, museums, aqueducts, roads, highways, and the massive Columbus Lighthouse, completed in 1992 during a later tenure.\nDuring Balaguer's administration, the Dominican military forced Haitians to cut sugarcane on Dominican sugar plantations (bateyes).In 1978, Balaguer was succeeded in the presidency by opposition candidate Antonio Guzm\u00e1n Fern\u00e1ndez, of the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD). Another PRD win in 1982 followed, under Salvador Jorge Blanco. Under the PRD presidents, the Dominican Republic enjoyed a period of relative freedom and basic human rights.\nBalaguer regained the presidency in 1986 and was re-elected in 1990 and 1994, this last time just defeating PRD candidate Jos\u00e9 Francisco Pe\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, a former mayor of Santo Domingo. The 1994 elections were flawed, bringing on international pressure, to which Balaguer responded by scheduling another presidential contest in 1996. Balaguer was not a candidate. The PSRC candidate was his Vice President Jacinto Peynado Garrigosa.\n\n\n=== 1996\u2013present ===\n\nIn the 1996 presidential election, Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez achieved the first-ever win for the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD), which Bosch had founded in 1973 after leaving the PRD (which he also had founded). Fern\u00e1ndez oversaw a fast-growing economy: growth averaged 7.7% per year, unemployment fell, and there were stable exchange and inflation rates.In 2000, the PRD's Hip\u00f3lito Mej\u00eda won the election. This was a time of economic troubles. Mej\u00eda was defeated in his re-election effort in 2004 by Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez of the PLD. In 2008, Fern\u00e1ndez was as elected for a third term. Fern\u00e1ndez and the PLD are credited with initiatives that have moved the country forward technologically, such as the construction of the Metro Railway (\"El Metro\"). On the other hand, his administrations have been accused of corruption.Danilo Medina of the PLD was elected president in 2012 and re-elected in 2016. On the other hand, a significant increase in crime, government corruption and a weak justice system threaten to overshadow their administrative period.The Dominican Republic has the ninth-largest economy in Latin America and is the largest economy in the Caribbean and Central American region. Over the last two decades, the Dominican Republic has had one of the fastest-growing economies in the Americas \u2013 with an average real GDP growth rate of 5.4% between 1992 and 2014. GDP growth in 2014 and 2015 reached 7.3 and 7.0%, respectively, the highest in the Western Hemisphere. In the first half of 2016 the Dominican economy grew 7.4% continuing its trend of rapid economic growth. Recent growth has been driven by construction, manufacturing, tourism, and mining. Private consumption has been strong, as a result of low inflation (under 1% on average in 2015), job creation, as well as a high level of remittances.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\n\n==== 20th century ====\nThe 20th century brought many prominent Dominican writers, and saw a general increase in the perception of Dominican literature.  Writers such as Juan Bosch (one of the greatest storytellers in Latin America), Pedro Mir (national poet of the Dominican Republic), Aida Cartagena Portalatin (poetess par excellence who spoke in the Era of Rafael Trujillo), Emilio Rodr\u00edguez Demorizi (the most important Dominican historian, with more than 1000 written works), Manuel del Cabral (main Dominican poet featured in black poetry), Hector Inchustegui Cabral (considered one of the most prominent voices of the Caribbean social poetry of the twentieth century), Miguel Alfonseca (poet belonging to Generation 60), Rene del Risco (acclaimed poet who was a participant in the June 14 Movement), Mateo Morrison (excellent poet and writer with numerous awards), among many more prolific authors, put the island in one of the most important in Literature in the twentieth century.\n\n\n==== 21st century ====\nNew 21st century Dominican writers have not yet achieved the renown of their 20th century counterparts. However, writers such as Frank B\u00e1ez (won the 2006 Santo Domingo Book Fair First Prize), Junot D\u00edaz (2008 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for his novel The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao) and Emil Cerda (won the Premio Joven Destacado Award 2019 for his novel M\u00e1s all\u00e1 de lo espiritual Vol. 1), lead Dominican literature in the 21st century. \n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Dominican Republic comprises the eastern five-eighths of Hispaniola, the second-largest island in the Greater Antilles, with the Atlantic Ocean to the north and the Caribbean Sea to the south. It shares the island roughly at a 2:1 ratio with Haiti, the north-to-south (though somewhat irregular) border between the two countries being 376 km (234 mi). To the north and north-west lie The Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands, and to the east, across the Mona Passage, the US Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The country's area is reported variously as 48,442 km2 (18,704 sq mi) (by the embassy in the United States) and 48,670 km2 (18,792 sq mi), making it the second largest country in the Antilles, after Cuba. The Dominican Republic's capital and largest city Santo Domingo is on the southern coast.\n\nThe Dominican Republic has four important mountain ranges. The most northerly is the Cordillera Septentrional (\"Northern Mountain Range\"), which extends from the northwestern coastal town of Monte Cristi, near the Haitian border, to the Saman\u00e1 Peninsula in the east, running parallel to the Atlantic coast. The highest range in the Dominican Republic \u2013 indeed, in the whole of the West Indies \u2013 is the Cordillera Central (\"Central Mountain Range\"). It gradually bends southwards and finishes near the town of Azua, on the Caribbean coast. In the Cordillera Central are the four highest peaks in the Caribbean: Pico Duarte (3,098 metres or 10,164 feet above sea level), La Pelona (3,094 metres or 10,151 feet), La Rucilla (3,049 metres or 10,003 feet), and Pico Yaque (2,760 metres or 9,055 feet). In the southwest corner of the country, south of the Cordillera Central, there are two other ranges: the more northerly of the two is the Sierra de Neiba, while in the south the Sierra de Bahoruco is a continuation of the Massif de la Selle in Haiti. There are other, minor mountain ranges, such as the Cordillera Oriental (\"Eastern Mountain Range\"), Sierra Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda, Sierra de Yamas\u00e1, and Sierra de Saman\u00e1.\nBetween the Central and Northern mountain ranges lies the rich and fertile Cibao valley. This major valley is home to the cities of Santiago and La Vega and most of the farming areas of the nation. Rather less productive are the semi-arid San Juan Valley, south of the Central Cordillera, and the Neiba Valley, tucked between the Sierra de Neiba and the Sierra de Bahoruco. Much of the land around the Enriquillo Basin is below sea level, with a hot, arid, desert-like environment. There are other smaller valleys in the mountains, such as the Constanza, Jarabacoa, Villa Altagracia, and Bonao valleys.\nThe Llano Costero del Caribe (\"Caribbean Coastal Plain\") is the largest of the plains in the Dominican Republic. Stretching north and east of Santo Domingo, it contains many sugar plantations in the savannahs that are common there. West of Santo Domingo its width is reduced to 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) as it hugs the coast, finishing at the mouth of the Ocoa River. Another large plain is the Plena de Azua (\"Azua Plain\"), a very arid region in Azua Province. A few other small coastal plains are on the northern coast and in the Pedernales Peninsula.\n\nFour major rivers drain the numerous mountains of the Dominican Republic. The Yaque del Norte is the longest and most important Dominican river. It carries excess water down from the Cibao Valley and empties into Monte Cristi Bay, in the northwest. Likewise, the Yuna River serves the Vega Real and empties into Saman\u00e1 Bay, in the northeast. Drainage of the San Juan Valley is provided by the San Juan River, tributary of the Yaque del Sur, which empties into the Caribbean, in the south. The Artibonito is the longest river of Hispaniola and flows westward into Haiti.\nThere are many lakes and coastal lagoons. The largest lake is Enriquillo, a salt lake at 45 metres (148 ft) below sea level, the lowest elevation in the Caribbean. Other important lakes are Laguna de Rinc\u00f3n or Cabral, with fresh water, and Laguna de Oviedo, a lagoon with brackish water.\nThere are many small offshore islands and cays that form part of the Dominican territory. The two largest islands near shore are Saona, in the southeast, and Beata, in the southwest. Smaller islands include the Cayos Siete Hermanos, Isla Cabra, Cayo Jackson, Cayo Lim\u00f3n, Cayo Levantado, Cayo la Bocaina, Catalanita, Cayo Pisaje and Isla Alto Velo. To the north, at distances of 100\u2013200 kilometres (62\u2013124 mi), are three extensive, largely submerged banks, which geographically are a southeast continuation of the Bahamas: Navidad Bank, Silver Bank, and Mouchoir Bank. Navidad Bank and Silver Bank have been officially claimed by the Dominican Republic. Isla Cabritos lies within Lago Enriquillo.\nThe Dominican Republic is located near fault action in the Caribbean. In 1946, it suffered a magnitude 8.1 earthquake off the northeast coast, triggering a tsunami that killed about 1,800, mostly in coastal communities. Caribbean countries and the United States have collaborated to create tsunami warning systems and are mapping high-risk low-lying areas.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nThe Dominican Republic has a tropical rainforest climate in the coastal and lowland areas. Due to its diverse topography, Dominican Republic's climate shows considerable variation over short distances and is the most varied of all the Antilles. The annual average temperature is 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). At higher elevations the temperature averages 18 \u00b0C (64.4 \u00b0F) while near sea level the average temperature is 28 \u00b0C (82.4 \u00b0F). Low temperatures of 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) are possible in the mountains while high temperatures of 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) are possible in protected valleys. January and February are the coolest months of the year while August is the hottest month. Snowfall can be seen on rare occasions on the summit of Pico Duarte.The wet season along the northern coast lasts from November through January. Elsewhere the wet season stretches from May through November, with May being the wettest month. Average annual rainfall is 1,500 millimetres (59.1 in) countrywide, with individual locations in the Valle de Neiba seeing averages as low as 350 millimetres (13.8 in) while the Cordillera Oriental averages 2,740 millimetres (107.9 in). The driest part of the country lies in the west.Tropical cyclones strike the Dominican Republic every couple of years, with 65% of the impacts along the southern coast. Hurricanes are most likely between June and October. The last major hurricane that struck the country was Hurricane Georges in 1998.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nThe Dominican Republic is a representative democracy or democratic republic, with three branches of power: executive, legislative, and judicial. The president of the Dominican Republic heads the executive branch and executes laws passed by the congress, appoints the cabinet, and is commander in chief of the armed forces. The president and vice-president run for office on the same ticket and are elected by direct vote for 4-year terms. The national legislature is bicameral, composed of a senate, which has 32 members, and the Chamber of Deputies, with 178 members.Judicial authority rests with the Supreme Court of Justice's 16 members. They are appointed by a council composed of the president, the leaders of both houses of Congress, the President of the Supreme Court, and an opposition or non\u2013governing-party member. The court \"alone hears actions against the president, designated members of his Cabinet, and members of Congress when the legislature is in session.\"The Dominican Republic has a multi-party political system. Elections are held every two years, alternating between the presidential elections, which are held in years evenly divisible by four, and the congressional and municipal elections, which are held in even-numbered years not divisible by four. \"International observers have found that presidential and congressional elections since 1996 have been generally free and fair.\" The Central Elections Board (JCE) of nine members supervises elections, and its decisions are unappealable. Starting from 2016, elections will be held jointly, after a constitutional reform.\n\n\n=== Political culture ===\nThe three major parties are the conservative Social Christian Reformist Party (Spanish: Partido Reformista Social Cristiano (PRSC)), in power 1966\u201378 and 1986\u201396; and the social democratic Dominican Revolutionary Party (Spanish: Partido Revolucionario Dominicano (PRD)), in power in 1963, 1978\u201386, and 2000\u201304; and the Dominican Liberation Party (Spanish: Partido de la Liberaci\u00f3n Dominicana (PLD)), in power 1996\u20132000 and since 2004.\nThe presidential elections of 2008 were held on May 16, 2008, with incumbent Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez winning 53% of the vote. He defeated Miguel Vargas Maldonado, of the PRD, who achieved a 40.48% share of the vote. Amable Aristy, of the PRSC, achieved 4.59% of the vote. Other minority candidates, which included former Attorney General Guillermo Moreno from the Movement for Independence, Unity and Change (Spanish: Movimiento Independencia, Unidad y Cambio (MIUCA)), and PRSC former presidential candidate and defector Eduardo Estrella, obtained less than 1% of the vote.\nIn the 2012 presidential elections, the incumbent president Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez (PLD) declined his aspirations and instead the PLD elected Danilo Medina as its candidate. This time the PRD presented ex-president Hipolito Mejia as its choice. The contest was won by Medina with 51.21% of the vote, against 46.95% in favor of Mejia. Candidate Guillermo Moreno obtained 1.37% of the votes.In 2014, the Modern Revolutionary Party (Spanish: Partido revolucionario Moderno) was created by a faction of leaders from the PRD and has since become the predominant opposition party, polling in second place for the upcoming May 2016 general elections.\n\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n\nThe Dominican Republic has a close relationship with the United States, mostly with the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and with the other states of the Inter-American system. \nThe Dominican Republic's relationship with neighbouring Haiti is strained over mass Haitian migration to the Dominican Republic, with citizens of the Dominican Republic blaming the Haitians for increased crime and other social problems. The Dominican Republic is a regular member of the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie.\nThe Dominican Republic has a Free Trade Agreement with the United States, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua via the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement. And an Economic Partnership Agreement with the European Union and the Caribbean Community via the Caribbean Forum.\n\n\n=== Military ===\n\nCongress authorizes a combined military force of 44,000 active duty personnel. Actual active duty strength is approximately 32,000. Approximately 50% of those are used for non-military activities such as security providers for government-owned non-military facilities, highway toll stations, prisons, forestry work, state enterprises, and private businesses. The commander in chief of the military is the president.\nThe army is larger than the other services combined with approximately 56,780 active duty personnel, consisting of six infantry brigades, a combat support brigade, and a combat service support brigade. The air force operates two main bases, one in the southern region near Santo Domingo and one in the northern region near Puerto Plata. The navy operates two major naval bases, one in Santo Domingo and one in Las Calderas on the southwestern coast, and maintains 12 operational vessels. The Dominican Republic has the largest military in the Caribbean region surpassing Cuba.The armed forces have organized a Specialized Airport Security Corps (CESA) and a Specialized Port Security Corps (CESEP) to meet international security needs in these areas. The secretary of the armed forces has also announced plans to form a specialized border corps (CESEF). The armed forces provide 75% of personnel to the National Investigations Directorate (DNI) and the Counter-Drug Directorate (DNCD).The Dominican National Police force contains 32,000 agents. The police are not part of the Dominican armed forces but share some overlapping security functions. Sixty-three percent of the force serve in areas outside traditional police functions, similar to the situation of their military counterparts.In 2018, Dominican Republic signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nThe Dominican Republic is divided into 31 provinces. Santo Domingo, the capital, is designated Distrito Nacional (National District). The provinces are divided into municipalities (municipios; singular municipio). They are the second-level political and administrative subdivisions of the country. The president appoints the governors of the 31 provinces. Mayors and municipal councils administer the 124 municipal districts and the National District (Santo Domingo). They are elected at the same time as congressional representatives.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe Dominican Republic is the largest economy (according to the U.S. State Department and the World Bank) in the Caribbean and Central American region. It is an upper middle-income developing country, with a 2015 GDP per capita of US$14,770, in PPP terms. Over the last 25 years, the Dominican Republic has had the fastest-growing economy in the Americas \u2013 with an average real GDP growth rate of 5.53% between 1992 and 2018. GDP growth in 2014 and 2015 reached 7.3 and 7.0%, respectively, the highest in the Western Hemisphere. In the first half of 2016 the Dominican economy grew 7.4%. As of 2015, the average wage in nominal terms is US$392 per month (RD$17,829). The country is the site of the second largest gold mine in the world, the Pueblo Viejo mine.During the last three decades, the Dominican economy, formerly dependent on the export of agricultural commodities (mainly sugar, cocoa and coffee), has transitioned to a diversified mix of services, manufacturing, agriculture, mining, and trade. The service sector accounts for almost 60% of GDP; manufacturing, for 22%; tourism, telecommunications and finance are the main components of the service sector; however, none of them accounts for more than 10% of the whole. The Dominican Republic has a stock market, Bolsa de Valores de la Republica Dominicana (BVRD). and advanced telecommunication system and transportation infrastructure. High unemployment and income inequality are long-term challenges. International migration affects the Dominican Republic greatly, as it receives and sends large flows of migrants. Mass illegal Haitian immigration and the integration of Dominicans of Haitian descent are major issues. A large Dominican diaspora exists, mostly in the United States, contributes to development, sending billions of dollars to Dominican families in remittances.Remittances in Dominican Republic increased to US$4571.30 million in 2014 from US$3333 million in 2013 (according to data reported by the Inter-American Development Bank). Economic growth takes place in spite of a chronic energy shortage, which causes frequent blackouts and very high prices. Despite a widening merchandise trade deficit, tourism earnings and remittances have helped build foreign exchange reserves. Following economic turmoil in the late 1980s and 1990, during which the gross domestic product (GDP) fell by up to 5% and consumer price inflation reached an unprecedented 100%, the Dominican Republic entered a period of growth and declining inflation until 2002, after which the economy entered a recession.This recession followed the collapse of the second-largest commercial bank in the country, Baninter, linked to a major incident of fraud valued at US$3.5 billion. The Baninter fraud had a devastating effect on the Dominican economy, with GDP dropping by 1% in 2003 as inflation ballooned by over 27%. All defendants, including the star of the trial, Ram\u00f3n B\u00e1ez Figueroa (the great-grandson of President Buenaventura B\u00e1ez), were convicted.\nAccording to the 2005 Annual Report of the United Nations Subcommittee on Human Development in the Dominican Republic, the country is ranked No. 71 in the world for resource availability, No. 79 for human development, and No. 14 in the world for resource mismanagement. These statistics emphasize national government corruption, foreign economic interference in the country, and the rift between the rich and poor.\nThe Dominican Republic has a noted problem of child labor in its coffee, rice, sugarcane, and tomato industries. The labor injustices in the sugarcane industry extend to forced labor according to the U.S. Department of Labor. Three large groups own 75% of the land: the State Sugar Council (Consejo Estatal del Az\u00facar, CEA), Grupo Vicini, and Central Romana Corporation.According to the 2016 Global Slavery Index, an estimated 104,800 people are enslaved in the modern day Dominican Republic, or 1.00% of the population. Some slaves in the Dominican Republic are held on sugar plantations, guarded by men on horseback with rifles, and forced to work.\n\n\n=== Currency ===\n\nThe Dominican peso (abbreviated $ or RD$; ISO 4217 code is \"DOP\") is the national currency, with the United States dollar, the Euro, the Canadian dollar and the Swiss franc also accepted at most tourist sites. The exchange rate to the U.S. dollar, liberalized by 1985, stood at 2.70 pesos per dollar in August 1986, 14.00 pesos in 1993, and 16.00 pesos in 2000. As of September 2018 the rate was 50.08 pesos per dollar.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nThe Dominican Republic is the most visited destination in the Caribbean. The year-round golf courses are major attractions. A geographically diverse nation, the Dominican Republic is home to both the Caribbean's tallest mountain peak, Pico Duarte, and the Caribbean's largest lake and point of lowest elevation, Lake Enriquillo. The island has an average temperature of 26 \u00b0C (78.8 \u00b0F) and great climatic and biological diversity. The country is also the site of the first cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress built in the Americas, located in Santo Domingo's Colonial Zone, a World Heritage Site.Tourism is one of the fueling factors in the Dominican Republic's economic growth. The Dominican Republic is the most popular tourist destination in the Caribbean. With the construction of projects like Cap Cana, San Souci Port in Santo Domingo, Casa De Campo and the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino (ancient Moon Palace Resort) in Punta Cana, the Dominican Republic expects increased tourism activity in the upcoming years.\nEcotourism has also been a topic increasingly important in this nation, with towns like Jarabacoa and neighboring Constanza, and locations like the Pico Duarte, Bahia de las Aguilas, and others becoming more significant in efforts to increase direct benefits from tourism. Most residents from other countries are required to get a tourist card, depending on the country they live in. In the last 10 years the Dominican Republic has become one of the worlds notably progressive states in terms of recycling and waste disposal. A UN report cited there was a 221.3% efficiency increase in the previous 10 years due, in part, to the opening of the largest open air landfill site located in the north 10 km from the Haitian border.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nThe country has three national trunk highways, which connect every major town. These are DR-1, DR-2, and DR-3, which depart from Santo Domingo toward the northern (Cibao), southwestern (Sur), and eastern (El Este) parts of the country respectively. These highways have been consistently improved with the expansion and reconstruction of many sections. Two other national highways serve as spur (DR-5) or alternative routes (DR-4).\nIn addition to the national highways, the government has embarked on an expansive reconstruction of spur secondary routes, which connect smaller towns to the trunk routes. In the last few years the government constructed a 106-kilometer toll road that connects Santo Domingo with the country's northeastern peninsula. Travelers may now arrive in the Saman\u00e1 Peninsula in less than two hours. Other additions are the reconstruction of the DR-28 (Jarabacoa \u2013 Constanza) and DR-12 (Constanza \u2013 Bonao). Despite these efforts, many secondary routes still remain either unpaved or in need of maintenance. There is currently a nationwide program to pave these and other commonly used routes. Also, the Santiago light rail system is in planning stages but currently on hold.\n\n\n=== Bus services ===\nThere are two main bus transportation services in the Dominican Republic: one controlled by the government, through the Oficina T\u00e9cnica de Transito Terrestre (OTTT) and the Oficina Metropolitana de Servicios de Autobuses (OMSA), and the other controlled by private business, among them, Federaci\u00f3n Nacional de Transporte La Nueva Opci\u00f3n (FENATRANO) and the Confederacion Nacional de Transporte (CONATRA). The government transportation system covers large routes in metropolitan areas such as Santo Domingo and Santiago.\nThere are many privately owned bus companies, such as Metro Servicios Tur\u00edsticos and Caribe Tours, that run daily routes.\n\n\n=== Santo Domingo Metro ===\n\nThe Dominican Republic has a rapid transit system in Santo Domingo, the country's capital. It is the most extensive metro system in the insular Caribbean and Central American region by length and number of stations. The Santo Domingo Metro is part of a major \"National Master Plan\" to improve transportation in Santo Domingo as well as the rest of the nation. The first line was planned to relieve traffic congestion in the M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez and Hermanas Mirabal Avenue. The second line, which opened in April 2013, is meant to relieve the congestion along the Duarte-Kennedy-Centenario Corridor in the city from west to east. The current length of the Metro, with the sections of the two lines open as of August 2013, is 27.35 kilometres (16.99 mi). Before the opening of the second line, 30,856,515 passengers rode the Santo Domingo Metro in 2012. With both lines opened, ridership increased to 61,270,054 passengers in 2014.\n\n\n=== Communications ===\n\nThe Dominican Republic has a well developed telecommunications infrastructure, with extensive mobile phone and landline services. Cable Internet and DSL are available in most parts of the country, and many Internet service providers offer 3G wireless internet service. The Dominican Republic became the second country in Latin America to have 4G LTE wireless service. The reported speeds are from 1 Mbit/s up to 100 Mbit/s for residential services.\nFor commercial service there are speeds from 256 kbit/s up to 154 Mbit/s. (Each set of numbers denotes downstream/upstream speed; that is, to the user/from the user.) Projects to extend Wi-Fi hot spots have been made in Santo Domingo. The country's commercial radio stations and television stations are in the process of transferring to the digital spectrum, via HD Radio and HDTV after officially adopting ATSC as the digital medium in the country with a switch-off of analog transmission by September 2015. The telecommunications regulator in the country is INDOTEL (Instituto Dominicano de Telecomunicaciones).\nThe largest telecommunications company is Claro \u2013 part of Carlos Slim's Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil \u2013 which provides wireless, landline, broadband, and IPTV services. In June 2009 there were more than 8 million phone line subscribers (land and cell users) in the D.R., representing 81% of the country's population and a fivefold increase since the year 2000, when there were 1.6 million. The communications sector generates about 3.0% of the GDP. There were 2,439,997 Internet users in March 2009.In November 2009, the Dominican Republic became the first Latin American country to pledge to include a \"gender perspective\" in every information and communications technology (ICT) initiative and policy developed by the government. This is part of the regional eLAC2010 plan. The tool the Dominicans have chosen to design and evaluate all the public policies is the APC Gender Evaluation Methodology (GEM).\n\n\n=== Electricity ===\n\nElectric power service has been unreliable since the Trujillo era, and as much as 75% of the equipment is that old. The country's antiquated power grid causes transmission losses that account for a large share of billed electricity from generators. The privatization of the sector started under a previous administration of Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez. The recent investment in a 345 kilovolt \"Santo Domingo\u2013Santiago Electrical Highway\" with reduced transmission losses, is being heralded as a major capital improvement to the national grid since the mid-1960s.\nDuring the Trujillo regime electrical service was introduced to many cities. Almost 95% of usage was not billed at all. Around half of the Dominican Republic's 2.1 million houses have no meters and most do not pay or pay a fixed monthly rate for their electric service.Household and general electrical service is delivered at 110 volts alternating at 60 Hz. Electrically powered items from the United States work with no modifications. The majority of the Dominican Republic has access to electricity. Tourist areas tend to have more reliable power, as do business, travel, healthcare, and vital infrastructure. Concentrated efforts were announced to increase efficiency of delivery to places where the collection rate reached 70%. The electricity sector is highly politicized. Some generating companies are undercapitalized and at times unable to purchase adequate fuel supplies.\n\n\n== Society ==\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\n\nThe Dominican Republic's population was 10,627,141 in 2018. In 2010, 31.2% of the population was under 15 years of age, with 6% of the population over 65 years of age. There were an estimated 102.3 males for every 100 females in 2020. The annual population growth rate for 2006\u20132007 was 1.5%, with the projected population for the year 2015 being 10,121,000.The population density in 2007 was 192 per km\u00b2 (498 per sq mi), and 63% of the population lived in urban areas. The southern coastal plains and the Cibao Valley are the most densely populated areas of the country. The capital city Santo Domingo had a population of 2,907,100 in 2010.Other important cities are Santiago de los Caballeros (pop. 745,293), La Romana (pop. 214,109), San Pedro de Macor\u00eds (pop. 185,255), Hig\u00fcey (153,174), San Francisco de Macor\u00eds (pop. 132,725), Puerto Plata (pop. 118,282), and La Vega (pop. 104,536). Per the United Nations, the urban population growth rate for 2000\u20132005 was 2.3%.\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\n\nIn a 2014 population survey, 70.4% self-identified as mixed (mestizo/indio 58%, mulatto 12.4%), 15.8% as black, 13.5% as white, and 0.3% as \"other\". Ethnic immigrant groups in the country include West Asians\u2014mostly Lebanese, Syrians, and Palestinians. East Asians, primarily ethnic Chinese and Japanese, can also be found. Europeans are represented mostly by Spanish whites but also with smaller populations of German Jews, Italians, Portuguese, British, Dutch, Danes, and Hungarians. Some converted Sephardic Jews from Spain were part of early expeditions; only Catholics were allowed to come to the New World. Later there were Jewish migrants coming from the Iberian peninsula and other parts of Europe in the 1700s. Some managed to reach the Caribbean as refugees during and after the Second World War. Some Sephardic Jews reside in Sos\u00faa while others are dispersed throughout the country. Self-identified Jews number about 3,000; other Dominicans may have some Jewish ancestry because of marriages among converted Jewish Catholics and other Dominicans since the colonial years. Some Dominicans born in the United States now reside in the Dominican Republic, creating a kind of expatriate community.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThe population of the Dominican Republic is mostly Spanish-speaking. The local variant of Spanish is called Dominican Spanish, which closely resembles other Spanish vernaculars in the Caribbean and has similarities to Canarian Spanish. In addition, it has influences from African languages and borrowed words from indigenous Caribbean languages particular to the island of Hispaniola. Schools are based on a Spanish educational model; English and French are mandatory foreign languages in both private and public schools, although the quality of foreign languages teaching is poor. Some private educational institutes provide teaching in other languages, notably Italian, Japanese and Mandarin.Haitian Creole is the largest minority language in the Dominican Republic and is spoken by Haitian immigrants and their descendants. There is a community of a few thousand people whose ancestors spoke Saman\u00e1 English in the Saman\u00e1 Peninsula. They are the descendants of formerly enslaved African Americans who arrived in the nineteenth century, but only a few elders speak the language today. Tourism, American pop culture, the influence of Dominican Americans, and the country's economic ties with the United States motivate other Dominicans to learn English. The Dominican Republic is ranked 2nd in Latin America and 23rd in the World on English proficiency.\n\n\n=== Population centres ===\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\n95.0%  Christians 2.6%  No religion 2.2%  Other religions As of 2014, 57% of the population (5.7 million) identified themselves as Roman Catholics and 23% (2.3 million) as Protestants (in Latin American countries, Protestants are often called Evangelicos because they emphasize personal and public evangelising and many are Evangelical Protestant or of a Pentecostal group). From 1896 to 1907 missionaries from the Episcopal, Free Methodist, Seventh-day Adventist and Moravians churches began work in the Dominican Republic. Three percent of the 10.63 million Dominican Republic population are Seventh-day Adventists. Recent immigration as well as proselytizing efforts have brought in other religious groups, with the following shares of the population: Spiritist: 2.2%, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints: 1.3%, Buddhist: 0.1%, Bah\u00e1'\u00ed: 0.1%, Chinese Folk Religion: 0.1%, Islam: 0.02%, Judaism: 0.01%.\nThe Catholic Church began to lose its strong dominance in the late 19th century. This was due to a lack of funding, priests, and support programs. During the same time, Protestant Evangelicalism began to gain a wider support \"with their emphasis on personal responsibility and family rejuvenation, economic entrepreneurship, and biblical fundamentalism\". The Dominican Republic has two Catholic patroness saints: Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Altagracia (Our Lady Of High Grace) and Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Mercedes (Our Lady Of Mercy).\nThe Dominican Republic has historically granted extensive religious freedom. According to the United States Department of State, \"The constitution specifies that there is no state church and provides for freedom of religion and belief. A concordat with the Vatican designates Catholicism as the official religion and extends special privileges to the Catholic Church not granted to other religious groups. These include the legal recognition of church law, use of public funds to underwrite some church expenses, and complete exoneration from customs duties.\" In the 1950s restrictions were placed upon churches by the government of Trujillo. Letters of protest were sent against the mass arrests of government adversaries. Trujillo began a campaign against the Catholic Church and planned to arrest priests and bishops who preached against the government. This campaign ended before it was put into place, with his assassination.\nDuring World War II a group of Jews escaping Nazi Germany fled to the Dominican Republic and founded the city of Sos\u00faa. It has remained the center of the Jewish population since.\n\n\n=== 20th century immigration ===\n\nIn the 20th century, many Arabs (from Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine), Japanese, and, to a lesser degree, Koreans settled in the country as agricultural laborers and merchants. The Chinese companies found business in telecom, mining, and railroads. The Arab community is rising at an increasing rate and is estimated at 80,000.In addition, there are descendants of immigrants who came from other Caribbean islands, including St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua, St. Vincent, Montserrat, Tortola, St. Croix, St. Thomas, and Guadeloupe. They worked on sugarcane plantations and docks and settled mainly in the cities of San Pedro de Macor\u00eds and Puerto Plata. Puerto Rican, and to a lesser extent, Cuban immigrants fled to the Dominican Republic from the mid-1800s until about 1940 due to a poor economy and social unrest in their respective home countries. Many Puerto Rican immigrants settled in Hig\u00fcey, among other cities, and quickly assimilated due to similar culture. Before and during World War II, 800 Jewish refugees moved to the Dominican Republic.Numerous immigrants have come from other Caribbean countries, as the country has offered economic opportunities. There is an increasing number of Puerto Rican immigrants, especially in and around Santo Domingo; they are believed to number around 10,000. There are over 700,000 people of Haitian descent, including a generation born in the Dominican Republic.\n\n\n==== Haitian immigration ====\n\nHaiti is the neighboring nation to the Dominican Republic and is considerably poorer, less developed and is additionally the least developed country in the western hemisphere. In 2003, 80% of all Haitians were poor (54% living in abject poverty) and 47.1% were illiterate. The country of nine million people also has a fast growing population, but over two-thirds of the labor force lack formal jobs. Haiti's per capita GDP (PPP) was $1,800 in 2017, or just over one-tenth of the Dominican figure.As a result, hundreds of thousands of Haitians have migrated to the Dominican Republic, with some estimates of 800,000 Haitians in the country, while others put the Haitian-born population as high as one million. They usually work at low-paying and unskilled jobs in building construction and house cleaning and in sugar plantations. There have been accusations that some Haitian immigrants work in slavery-like conditions and are severely exploited.Due to the lack of basic amenities and medical facilities in Haiti a large number of Haitian women, often arriving with several health problems, cross the border to Dominican soil. They deliberately come during their last weeks of pregnancy to obtain medical attention for childbirth, since Dominican public hospitals do not refuse medical services based on nationality or legal status. Statistics from a hospital in Santo Domingo report that over 22% of childbirths are by Haitian mothers.Haiti also suffers from severe environmental degradation. Deforestation is rampant in Haiti; today less than 4 percent of Haiti's forests remain, and in many places the soil has eroded right down to the bedrock. Haitians burn wood charcoal for 60% of their domestic energy production. Because of Haiti running out of plant material to burn, some Haitian bootleggers have created an illegal market for charcoal on the Dominican side. Conservative estimates calculate the illegal movement of 115 tons of charcoal per week from the Dominican Republic to Haiti. Dominican officials estimate that at least 10 trucks per week are crossing the border loaded with charcoal.In 2005, Dominican President Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez criticized collective expulsions of Haitians as having taken place \"in an abusive and inhuman way.\" After a UN delegation issued a preliminary report stating that it found a profound problem of racism and discrimination against people of Haitian origin, Dominican Foreign Minister Carlos Morales Troncoso issued a formal statement denouncing it, asserting that \"our border with Haiti has its problems[;] this is our reality and it must be understood. It is important not to confuse national sovereignty with indifference, and not to confuse security with xenophobia.\"The children of Haitian immigrants are eligible for Haitian nationality, are denied it by Haiti because of a lack of proper documents or witnesses.\n\n\n=== Emigration ===\n\nThe first of three late-20th century emigration waves began in 1961 after the assassination of dictator Trujillo, due to fear of retaliation by Trujillo's allies and political uncertainty in general. In 1965, the United States began a military occupation of the Dominican Republic to end a civil war. Upon this, the U.S. eased travel restrictions, making it easier for Dominicans to obtain U.S. visas. From 1966 to 1978, the exodus continued, fueled by high unemployment and political repression. Communities established by the first wave of immigrants to the U.S. created a network that assisted subsequent arrivals.In the early 1980s, underemployment, inflation, and the rise in value of the dollar all contributed to a third wave of emigration from the Dominican Republic. Today, emigration from the Dominican Republic remains high. In 2012, there were approximately 1.7 million people of Dominican descent in the U.S., counting both native- and foreign-born. There was also a growing Dominican immigration to Puerto Rico, with nearly 70,000 Dominicans living there as of 2010. Although that number is slowly decreasing and immigration trends have reversed because of Puerto Rico's economic crisis as of 2016.\nThere is a significant Dominican population in Spain.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nIn 2020, the Dominican Republic had an estimated birth rate of 18.5 per 1000 and a death rate of 6.3 per 1000.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nPrimary education is regulated by the Ministry of Education, with education being a right of all citizens and youth in the Dominican Republic.Preschool education is organized in different cycles and serves the 2\u20134 age group and the 4\u20136 age group. Preschool education is not mandatory except for the last year. Basic education is compulsory and serves the population of the 6\u201314 age group. Secondary education is not compulsory, although it is the duty of the state to offer it for free. It caters to the 14\u201318 age group and is organized in a common core of four years and three modes of two years of study that are offered in three different options: general or academic, vocational (industrial, agricultural, and services), and artistic.\nThe higher education system consists of institutes and universities. The institutes offer courses of a higher technical level. The universities offer technical careers, undergraduate and graduate; these are regulated by the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\n\nIn 2012, the Dominican Republic had a murder rate of 22.1 per 100,000 population. There was a total of 2,268 murders in the Dominican Republic in 2012.The Dominican Republic has become a trans-shipment point for Colombian drugs destined for Europe as well as the United States and Canada. Money-laundering via the Dominican Republic is favored by Colombian drug cartels for the ease of illicit financial transactions. In 2004, it was estimated that 8% of all cocaine smuggled into the United States had come through the Dominican Republic. The Dominican Republic responded with increased efforts to seize drug shipments, arrest and extradite those involved, and combat money-laundering.\nThe often light treatment of violent criminals has been a continuous source of local controversy. In April 2010, five teenagers, aged 15 to 17, shot and killed two taxi drivers and killed another five by forcing them to drink drain-cleaning acid. On September 24, 2010, the teens were sentenced to prison terms of three to five years, despite the protests of the taxi drivers' families.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nDue to cultural syncretism, the culture and customs of the Dominican people have a European cultural basis, influenced by both African and native Ta\u00edno elements, although endogenous elements have emerged within Dominican culture; culturally the Dominican Republic is among the most-European countries in Spanish America, alongside Puerto Rico, Cuba, Central Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay. Spanish institutions in the colonial era were able to predominate in the Dominican culture's making-of as a relative success in the acculturation and cultural assimilation of African slaves diminished African cultural influence in comparison to other Caribbean countries.\nMusic and sport are of great importance in the Dominican culture, with Merengue and Bachata as the national dance and music, and baseball as the favorite sport.\n\n\n=== Visual arts ===\nDominican art is perhaps most commonly associated with the bright, vibrant colors and images that are sold in every tourist gift shop across the country. However, the country has a long history of fine art that goes back to the middle of the 1800s when the country became independent and the beginnings of a national art scene emerged.\nHistorically, the painting of this time were centered around images connected to national independence, historical scenes, portraits but also landscapes and images of still life. Styles of painting ranged between neoclassicism and romanticism. Between 1920 and 1940 the art scene was influenced by styles of realism and impressionism. Dominican artists were focused on breaking from previous, academic styles in order to develop more independent and individual styles.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe architecture in the Dominican Republic represents a complex blend of diverse cultures. The deep influence of the European colonists is the most evident throughout the country. Characterized by ornate designs and baroque structures, the style can best be seen in the capital city of Santo Domingo, which is home to the first cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in all of the Americas, located in the city's Colonial Zone, an area declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The designs carry over into the villas and buildings throughout the country. It can also be observed on buildings that contain stucco exteriors, arched doors and windows, and red tiled roofs.\nThe indigenous peoples of the Dominican Republic have also had a significant influence on the architecture of the country. The Ta\u00edno people relied heavily on the mahogany and guano (dried palm tree leaf) to put together crafts, artwork, furniture, and houses. Utilizing mud, thatched roofs, and mahogany trees, they gave buildings and the furniture inside a natural look, seamlessly blending in with the island's surroundings.\nLately, with the rise in tourism and increasing popularity as a Caribbean vacation destination, architects in the Dominican Republic have now begun to incorporate cutting-edge designs that emphasize luxury. In many ways an architectural playground, villas and hotels implement new styles, while offering new takes on the old. This new style is characterized by simplified, angular corners and large windows that blend outdoor and indoor spaces. As with the culture as a whole, contemporary architects embrace the Dominican Republic's rich history and various cultures to create something new. Surveying modern villas, one can find any combination of the three major styles: a villa may contain angular, modernist building construction, Spanish Colonial-style arched windows, and a traditional Taino hammock in the bedroom balcony.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nDominican cuisine is predominantly Spanish, Ta\u00edno, and African. The typical cuisine is quite similar to what can be found in other Latin American countries. One breakfast dish consists of eggs and mang\u00fa (mashed, boiled plantain). Heartier versions of mang\u00fa are accompanied by deep-fried meat (Dominican salami, typically), cheese, or both. Lunch, generally the largest and most important meal of the day, usually consists of rice, meat, beans, and  salad. \"La Bandera\" (literally \"The Flag\") is the most popular lunch dish; it consists of meat and red beans on white rice. Sancocho is a stew often made with seven varieties of meat.\n\nMeals tend to favor meats and starches over dairy products and vegetables. Many dishes are made with sofrito, which is a mix of local herbs used as a wet rub for meats and saut\u00e9ed to bring out all of a dish's flavors. Throughout the south-central coast, bulgur, or whole wheat, is a main ingredient in quipes or tipili (bulgur salad). Other favorite Dominican foods include chicharr\u00f3n, yuca, casabe, pastelitos (empanadas), batata, yam, pasteles en hoja, chimichurris, and tostones.\nSome treats Dominicans enjoy are arroz con leche (or arroz con dulce), bizcocho dominicano (lit. Dominican cake), habichuelas con dulce, flan, fr\u00edo fr\u00edo (snow cones), dulce de leche, and ca\u00f1a (sugarcane). The beverages Dominicans enjoy are Morir So\u00f1ando, rum, beer, Mama Juana, batida (smoothie), jugos naturales (freshly squeezed fruit juices), mab\u00ed, coffee, and chaca (also called maiz caqueao/casqueado, maiz con dulce and maiz con leche), the last item being found only in the southern provinces of the country such as San Juan.\n\n\n=== Music and dance ===\n\nMusically, the Dominican Republic is known for the world popular musical style and genre called merengue, a type of lively, fast-paced rhythm and dance music consisting of a tempo of about 120 to 160 beats per minute (though it varies) based on musical elements like drums, brass, chorded instruments, and accordion, as well as some elements unique to the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, such as the tambora and g\u00fcira.\nIts syncopated beats use Latin percussion, brass instruments, bass, and piano or keyboard. Between 1937 and 1950 merengue music was promoted internationally by Dominican groups like Billo's Caracas Boys, Chapuseaux and Damiron \"Los Reyes del Merengue,\" Joseito Mateo, and others. Radio, television, and international media popularized it further. Some well known merengue performers are Wilfrido Vargas, Johnny Ventura, singer-songwriter Los Hermanos Rosario, Juan Luis Guerra, Fernando Villalona, Eddy Herrera, Sergio Vargas, To\u00f1o Rosario, Milly Quezada, and Chich\u00ed Peralta.\nMerengue became popular in the United States, mostly on the East Coast, during the 1980s and 1990s, when many Dominican artists residing in the U.S. (particularly New York) started performing in the Latin club scene and gained radio airplay. They included Victor Roque y La Gran Manzana, Henry Hierro, Zacarias Ferreira, Aventura, and Milly Jocelyn Y Los Vecinos. The emergence of bachata, along with an increase in the number of Dominicans living among other Latino groups in New York, New Jersey, and Florida, has contributed to Dominican music's overall growth in popularity.Bachata, a form of music and dance that originated in the countryside and rural marginal neighborhoods of the Dominican Republic, has become quite popular in recent years. Its subjects are often romantic; especially prevalent are tales of heartbreak and sadness. In fact, the original name for the genre was amargue (\"bitterness,\" or \"bitter music,\"), until the rather ambiguous (and mood-neutral) term bachata became popular. Bachata grew out of, and is still closely related to, the pan-Latin American romantic style called bolero. Over time, it has been influenced by merengue and by a variety of Latin American guitar styles.\nPalo is an Afro-Dominican sacred music that can be found throughout the island. The drum and human voice are the principal instruments. Palo is played at religious ceremonies\u2014usually coinciding with saints' religious feast days\u2014as well as for secular parties and special occasions. Its roots are in the Congo region of central-west Africa, but it is mixed with European influences in the melodies.Salsa music has had a great deal of popularity in the country. During the late 1960s Dominican musicians like Johnny Pacheco, creator of the Fania All Stars, played a significant role in the development and popularization of the genre.\nDominican rock and Reggaeton are also popular. Many, if not the majority, of its performers are based in Santo Domingo and Santiago.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\n\nThe country boasts one of the ten most important design schools in the region, La Escuela de Dise\u00f1o de Altos de Chav\u00f3n, which is making the country a key player in the world of fashion and design. Noted fashion designer Oscar de la Renta was born in the Dominican Republic in 1932, and became a US citizen in 1971. He studied under the leading Spaniard designer Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga and then worked with the house of Lanvin in Paris. By 1963, he had designs bearing his own label. After establishing himself in the US, de la Renta opened boutiques across the country. His work blends French and Spaniard fashion with American styles. Although he settled in New York, de la Renta also marketed his work in Latin America, where it became very popular, and remained active in his native Dominican Republic, where his charitable activities and personal achievements earned him the Juan Pablo Duarte Order of Merit and the Order of Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n. De la Renta died of complications from cancer on October 20, 2014.\n\n\n=== National symbols ===\n\nSome of the Dominican Republic's important symbols are the flag, the coat of arms, and the national anthem, titled Himno Nacional. The flag has a large white cross that divides it into four quarters. Two quarters are red and two are blue. Red represents the blood shed by the liberators. Blue expresses God's protection over the nation. The white cross symbolizes the struggle of the liberators to bequeath future generations a free nation. An alternative interpretation is that blue represents the ideals of progress and liberty, whereas white symbolizes peace and unity among Dominicans.In the center of the cross is the Dominican coat of arms, in the same colors as the national flag. The coat of arms pictures a red, white, and blue flag-draped shield with a Bible, a gold cross, and arrows; the shield is surrounded by an olive branch (on the left) and a palm branch (on the right). The Bible traditionally represents the truth and the light. The gold cross symbolizes the redemption from slavery, and the arrows symbolize the noble soldiers and their proud military.  A blue ribbon above the shield reads, \"Dios, Patria, Libertad\" (meaning \"God, Fatherland, Liberty\"). A red ribbon under the shield reads, \"Rep\u00fablica Dominicana\" (meaning \"Dominican Republic\"). Out of all the flags in the world, the depiction of a Bible is unique to the Dominican flag.\nThe national flower is the Bayahibe Rose and the national tree is the West Indian Mahogany. The national bird is the Cigua Palmera or Palmchat (\"Dulus dominicus\").The Dominican Republic celebrates Dia de la Altagracia on January 21 in honor of its patroness, Duarte's Day on January 26 in honor of one of its founding fathers, Independence Day on February 27, Restoration Day on August 16, Virgen de las Mercedes on September 24, and Constitution Day on November 6.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nBaseball is by far the most popular sport in the Dominican Republic. The country has a baseball league of six teams. Its season usually begins in October and ends in January. After the United States, the Dominican Republic has the second highest number of Major League Baseball (MLB) players. Ozzie Virgil Sr. became the first Dominican-born player in the MLB on September 23, 1956. Juan Marichal, Pedro Mart\u00ednez, and Vladimir Guerrero are the only Dominican-born players in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Other notable baseball players born in the Dominican Republic are Jos\u00e9 Bautista, Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9, George Bell, Robinson Can\u00f3, Rico Carty, Bartolo Col\u00f3n, Nelson Cruz, Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n, Ubaldo Jim\u00e9nez, Francisco Liriano, David Ortiz, Pl\u00e1cido Polanco, Albert Pujols, Hanley Ram\u00edrez, Manny Ram\u00edrez, Jos\u00e9 Reyes, Sammy Sosa, and Miguel Tejada. Felipe Alou has also enjoyed success as a manager and Omar Minaya as a general manager. In 2013, the Dominican team went undefeated en route to winning the World Baseball Classic.\nIn boxing, the country has produced scores of world-class fighters and several world champions, such as Carlos Cruz, his brother Leo, Juan Guzman, and Joan Guzman. Basketball also enjoys a relatively high level of popularity. Tito Horford, his son Al, Felipe Lopez, and Francisco Garcia are among the Dominican-born players currently or formerly in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Olympic gold medalist and world champion hurdler F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez hails from the Dominican Republic, as does NFL defensive end Luis Castillo.Other important sports are volleyball, introduced in 1916 by U.S. Marines and controlled by the Dominican Volleyball Federation, taekwondo, in which Gabriel Mercedes won an Olympic silver medal in 2008, and judo.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nIndex of Dominican Republic-related articles\nOutline of the Dominican Republic\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nThatsDominican.Com (June 18, 2011). \"Dominican Republic Population\".

        "wiki": "San Marino is a residential city in Los Angeles County, California, United States.  It was incorporated on April 25, 1913. As of the 2010 census the population was 13,147. The city is ranked as number 78 among the wealthiest places in the nation in terms of household income. By extension, with a median home price of $2,699,098, San Marino is one of the most expensive and exclusive neighborhoods in Los Angeles.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of name ===\nThe city takes its name from the ancient Republic of San Marino, founded by Saint Marinus who fled his home in Dalmatia (modern Croatia) at the time of the Diocletianic Persecution of Christians. Marinus took refuge at Monte Titano on the Italian peninsula, where he built a chapel and founded a monastic community in 301 A.D.  The state which grew from the monastery is the world's oldest surviving republic.The seal of the City of San Marino, California is modeled on that of the republic, depicting the Three Towers of San Marino each capped with a bronze plume, surrounded by a heart-shaped scroll with two roundels and a lozenge (of unknown significance) at the top. The crown representing the monarchy on the original was replaced with five stars representing the five members of the City's governing body. Beneath the city's seal are crossed palm fronds and orange branches. Note that other than the city's use of the name and copy of the Republic of San Marino seal there is absolutely no historical connection between them.\nThe city celebrated its centennial in 2013, including publication by the San Marino Historical Society of a 268-page book, San Marino, A Centennial History, by Elizabeth Pomeroy. In September 2014, this book and author Elizabeth Pomeroy received a prestigious Award of Merit for Leadership in History from the American Association for State and Local History (AASLH).\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe site of San Marino was originally occupied by a village of Tongva (Gabriele\u00f1o) Indians located approximately where the Huntington School is today. The area was part of the lands of the San Gabriel Mission.  (The \"Old Mill\" was the Mission's grist mill.)  Principal portions of San Marino were included in an 1838 Mexican land grant of 128 acres to Victoria Bartolmea Reid, a Gabriele\u00f1a Indian.  (After her first husband, also a Gabriele\u00f1o, died in 1836 of smallpox, she remarried Scotsman Hugo Reid in 1837).  She called the property Rancho Huerta de Cuati.  After Hugo Reid's death in 1852, Se\u00f1ora Reid sold her rancho in 1854 to Don Benito Wilson, the first Anglo owner of Rancho San Pascual.  In 1873, Don Benito conveyed to his son-in-law, James DeBarth Shorb, 500 acres (2.0 km2), including Rancho Huerta de Cuati, which Shorb named \"San Marino\" after his grandfather's plantation in Maryland, which, in turn, was named after the Republic of San Marino located on the Italian Peninsula in Europe.\n\n\n=== History (1900s) ===\nIn 1903, the Shorb rancho was purchased by Henry E. Huntington (1850\u20131927), who built a large mansion on the property. The site of the Shorb/Huntington rancho is occupied today by the Huntington Library, which houses a world-renowned art collection, research and rare-book library, and botanical gardens. In 1913 the three primary ranchos of Wilson, Patton, and Huntington, together with the subdivided areas from those and smaller ranchos, such as the Stoneman, White, and Rose ranchos, were incorporated as the city of San Marino.The first mayor of the city of San Marino was George Smith Patton (1856-1927), the son of a slain Confederate States of America colonel in the U.S. Civil War (also named George Smith Patton, 1833-1864). He married Ruth Wilson, the daughter of Don Benito Wilson.  Their son was the World War II general, George S. Patton Jr.\nTo a prior generation of Southern Californians, San Marino was known for its old-money wealth and as a bastion of the region's WASP gentry.  By mid-century, other European ethnic groups had become the majority. \nIn 1970, the city was 99.7% White.\nIn 1984, at Huntington Middle School, a Chinese 17 year old youth was brutally attacked with pepper spray and racial slurs by three White teenagers. As a result of racial tensions, the city formed an Ethnic Harmony Commission\" to study the new racial make up in the city.By 1990, the city's households were 23.7% Asian.\nIn 2000, the city's Asian households increased to 40%.\nIn recent decades, immigrants of Chinese and Taiwanese ancestry have come to represent more than 60% of the population, perhaps due to its location in the San Gabriel Valley, known to be a popular destination for East Asian immigrants.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe city is located in the San Rafael Hills, and is divided into seven zones, based on minimum lot size. The smallest lot size is about 4,500 square feet (420 m2), with many averaging over 30,000 square feet (2,800 m2). Because of this and other factors, most of the homes in San Marino, built between 1920 and 1950, do not resemble the houses in surrounding Southern California neighborhoods (with the exception, perhaps, of neighboring portions of Pasadena). San Marino has also fostered a sense of historic preservation among its homeowners. With minor exceptions, the city's strict design review and zoning laws have thus far prevented the development of large homes found elsewhere in Los Angeles.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 3.8 square miles (9.8 km2), virtually all land.\nSan Marino is highly restrictive of commercial operations in the city. It is one of the few cities that requires commercial vehicles to have permits to work within the city. The rationale is that commercial vehicle operators and service providers, such as gardeners, pool service providers and maintenance workers, are more likely to cause social disruption within the city, and so must be preauthorized for crime control and prosecutorial purposes. This regulation and others, including the bans on apartment buildings, townhouses and overnight parking, are some of the more obvious examples.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== 2010 ===\nThe 2010 United States Census reported that San Marino had a population of 13,147. The population density was 3,483.4 people per square mile (1,345.0/km2). The racial makeup of San Marino was 5,434 (41.3%) White (37.1% Non-Hispanic White), 55 (0.4%) African American, 5 (0.0%) Native American, 7,039 (53.5%) Asian, 2 (0.0%) Pacific Islander, 198 (1.5%) from other races, and 414 (3.1%) from two or more races.  Hispanic or Latino of any race were 855 persons (6.5%).\nThe census reported that 13,066 people (99.4% of the population) lived in households, 81 (0.6%) lived in non-institutionalized group quarters, and 0 (0%) were institutionalized.\nThere were 4,330 households, out of which 1,818 (42.0%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 3,220 (74.4%) were opposite-sex married couples living together, 367 (8.5%) had a female householder with no husband present, 143 (3.3%) had a male householder with no wife present.

The median age was 45.3 years. For every 100 females, there were 92.4 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.7 males.\nThere were 4,477 housing units at an average density of 1,186.2 per square mile (458.0/km2), of which 3,959 (91.4%) were owner-occupied, and 371 (8.6%) were occupied by renters. The homeowner vacancy rate was 0.5%; the rental vacancy rate was 6.5%; 11,834 people (90.0% of the population) lived in owner-occupied housing units and 1,232 people (9.4%) lived in rental housing units.\nAccording to the 2010 United States Census, San Marino had a median household income of $131,758, with 5.4% of the population living below the federal poverty line.\n\n\n=== 2000 ===\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 12,945 people, 4,266 households, and 3,673 families residing in the city. The population density was 3,430.5 per square mile (1,325.8/km2). There were 4,437 housing units at an average density of 1,175.8 per square mile (454.4/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 51.98% White, 0.15% African American, 0.05% Native American, 47.7% Asian, 0.08% Pacific Islander, 1.04% from other races, and 2.30% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 3.25% of the population. More than one-third of the city's population, 33.3%, was Chinese.There were 4,266 households, out of which 42% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 75% were married couples living together, 8.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 13.9% were non-families. Of all households 12% were made up of individuals, and 7.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.03 and the average family size was 3.29.\nIn the city, the age distribution of the population showed 26.5% under the age of 18, 6.4% from 18 to 24, 21.5% from 25 to 44, 29.4% from 45 to 64, and 16.2% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 43 years (this was older than average age in the U.S.). For every 100 females, there were 93.1 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 89.1 males.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $147,267, and the median income for a family was $155,708. Males had a median income of $98,928 versus $51,853 for females. The per capita income for the city was $59,150.  About 3.7% of families and 5.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 4.8% of those under age 18 and 3.0% of those age 65 or over. The vast majority, 69.7% of persons, had a Bachelor's degree or higher, compared to 27.2% at the national average.San Marino is one of the county's cities with the highest proportion of residents of Asian ancestry. These were the ten neighborhoods in Los Angeles County with the largest percentage of Asian residents, according to the 2000 census:\n\n\n== Arts and culture ==\n\n\n=== Notable sites ===\n\nSan Marino is the location of the Huntington Library, Art Museum, and Botanical Gardens. In 1919, Henry E. Huntington provided limited access to his art collection, library containing the rare books and historical documents, and botanical collection. The Huntington's library contains 8 million manuscripts, 440,000 rare books, 454,000 reference books, 900,000 prints and ephemera, 777,000 photographs, and 300,000 digital files. The Huntington's art collections are housed in his large Neoclassical\u2013Palladian mansion and feature European and American art spanning more than 500 years. In addition, the surrounding botanical gardens span approximately 120 acres and contain more than a dozen themed gardens. Collectively, the institution is known as \"The Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens\", or as \"The Huntington,\" to the public.El Molino Viejo (\"The Old Mill\"), completed about 1816 as a grist mill for Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel, is in San Marino. The original two-story structure measured 53 feet (16 m) by 26 feet (7.9 m). It is the oldest commercial building in Southern California. The town is located on the former lands of the historic Rancho Huerta de Cuati.The Edwin Hubble House: From 1925 to 1953, this two-story stucco home was the residence of one of America's greatest 20th-century astronomers, Edwin Hubble, who, among other accomplishments, discovered extragalactic nebulae and their separation from each other.  It is a National Historic Landmark.The Michael White Adobe House, is located on the high school campus and houses the San Marino Historical Society archives.The University of Southern California owns a house in San Marino which is used as the residence of the President of the University. The residence and grounds are often used for University Presidential events.\nAcross from City Hall is the Centennial Clock, standing at the northeast corner of Huntington Drive and San Marino Avenue, donated to the community in 2005 by the Rotary Club of San Marino in celebration of Rotary International's 100th anniversary. Dedicated on July 4, 2005, the nineteen foot high clock includes a time capsule with artifacts donated by residents and community organizations which is to be opened on July 4, 2039 to mark the 100th anniversary of the Rotary Club of San Marino.In the middle of San Marino lies Lacy Park, a 30-acre (120,000 m2) expanse of grass and trees. Originally named Wilson Lake in 1875, the land was purchased by the city in 1925 and dedicated as a park. It is one of the few neighborhood parks that charge for admission, with a $5 fee for non-San Marino residents on weekends. A picnic area is often the site of musical concerts, civic events and pancake breakfasts.  Within the park are two walking loops:  an inner loop of approximately 3/4 mile in length, and an outer loop of approximately 1-mile (1.6 km) in length.  Dogs are welcome with their owners, providing they are on a leash. In recent years, proposals from SMHS alumni Brent and Derek Barker to build a dedicated dog park on the unlandscaped western edge of the park have been shelved due to strident opposition from some of the city's elderly residents. The park includes six championship tennis courts and a pro shop, administered by the San Marino Tennis Foundation. At the west entrance of the park is the Rose Arbor, which is of special significance for the people of San Marino. It is sixty years old and has long been a source of beauty and tranquility to many residents. In recent years the care and upkeep of the Rose Arbor itself has been augmented by private donations from residents who have chosen to sponsor individual posts. The park recently built a memorial to General George S. Patton (a native of San Marino) and also a large memorial to the Armed Forces along with a statue of a sad soldier. The memorial includes the names of all military personnel from San Marino.The city's local newspaper office is located near the city's most prominent street, Huntington Drive. \"The San Marino Tribune\" has been the official newspaper of the city since 1929. There are two sections of the weekly paper, an \"A\" section and a \"B\" section, the distinction being that it covers not only San Marino news but also the Pasadena, San Gabriel, Alhambra, Arcadia and South Pasadena news.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Local government ===\nGoverning the City of San Marino is a city council of five members, elected by the people for a four-year term. Elections are consolidated with the county and are held on the first Tuesday, following the first Monday in November of odd numbered years.  Terms are staggered so that three seats are available during one election cycle and two seats are available during the next cycle. In 2015, the state enacted a law to require municipalities to consolidate their elections beginning January 1, 2018. The five council members serve without any financial compensation and elect one of their own members as Mayor.\nThe current city council members are: \n\nMayor: Gretchen S. Romey (2020) \nVice Mayor: Ken Ude (2020)\nCouncil members: Dr. Steven W. Huang, Susan Jakubowski, and Steve Talt (2020)San Marino's Fiscal Year 2019-2020 operating budget is $25,807,192. The city manager reports that for FY 2019-2020 \"personnel costs comprise 2/3rds of the operating budget, and the largest portion of the increase from FY 2018-2019 is in that area.\"The San Marino City Council page states:\n \"San Marino was formed to protect your personal rights and to control the growth and activities of the City in such a way that each individual resident will be guaranteed a pleasant place in which to live with a minimum of nuisance, with assurance that his property values will be protected by stringent zoning regulations. It is your City Council's desire to acquaint the old and new residents with the history and background of San Marino, its many advantages and some of your responsibilities as a citizen.\"\n\n\n=== List of mayors ===\nThis is a list of San Marino mayors by year.\n\n1913-1922 George S.

There were three teachers and thirty-five pupils, grades kindergarten through the eighth; High School students attended South Pasadena High School for 50 years, until San Marino High School was founded in 1952.  San Marino High School graduated its first class in 1956. The high school's mascot, \"The Titans\", comes from Mt. Titano, in the Republic of San Marino.San Marino High School is situated on the former site of Carver Elementary School.  In 1996, the high school reconstruction was begun and the school is now equipped with new laboratories, classrooms, and ethernet connections, supported mainly by bond issues and rigorous fund-raising by the San Marino Schools Endowment. The new buildings include a brand new cafeteria, orchestra and band room, dance studio, journalism lab, and renovated auditoriums, as well as a renovated baseball field and a brand new football field/track. The School Board's budget totals around $3 million in a given year.\nSan Marino High School is part of the San Marino Unified School District.  Its public funding is supplemented by private donations raised through the San Marino Schools Foundation. Each year, the Foundation raises funds necessary to balance the District's budget.  To date, the San Marino Schools Foundation has contributed $18,268,485 to the schools since its inception in March 1980.  Between 2013 and 2017, the district was noted for having the highest percentage of students meet and exceed the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress standards.The San Marino Unified School District has, been ranked as the top unified school district in the state of California for eighteen consecutive years, including 2018. Each of its public primary schools has also been honored as a California Distinguished School and a National Blue Ribbon School.There are four public schools in San Marino Unified School District:\n\nValentine Elementary School\nCarver Elementary School\nHuntington Middle School\nSan Marino High SchoolThe two elementary schools offer instruction for grades K-5, the middle school for grades 6-8 and the high school for grades 9-12.  The middle school was named Henry E. Huntington School, after San Marino's \"first citizen.\" In 1953, a new K. L. Carver Elementary was completed at its current location on San Gabriel Boulevard and was named after a school board member of 19 years \u2013 K. L. Carver.\nStoneman Elementary School, named for Governor George Stoneman, who had resided in San Marino, is no longer used for instruction by San Marino School District. The former school is now leased by the San Marino City Recreation Department and houses San Marino Unified School District special education staff.In November 2007, San Marino High School was ranked 82nd on a list of the best high schools in the nation, according to U.S. News & World Report.\n\n\n=== Private schools ===\nSouthwestern Academy, a private college preparatory school, was founded on April 7, 1924. The campus was part of an original Spanish grant (the old ranch grew orange and avocado trees) and the land was subsequently legalized by Abraham Lincoln. \"Southwestern Academy\" was named to capture the distinctive spirit of the Southwestern United States.  Pioneer Hall, which was Southwestern's original campus building, was the home of then Governor, George Stoneman.\nSaints Felicitas and Perpetua school is a Catholic school that offers education in grades K-8.  The city took the Archdiocese of Los Angeles to the Supreme Court to block the opening of this school, as it was attempting to demolish a historical site called Casa Blanca or the Old Adobe (at one time the Luther Harvey Titus Adobe) to make way for the new school.  Saints Felicitas & Perpetua School was completed and dedicated in 1950.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Newspapers ===\nThe city is served by the San Marino Tribune, a paid community weekly newspaper and the San Marino Outlook, also a community weekly newspaper.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\nThe city is currently served by the San Marino Police Department.The Crowell Public Library opened in 2008.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n\n=== Movies ===\nFather of the Bride, The Wedding Singer, and The Holiday were filmed in San Marino.\n\n\n=== Television ===\nTV shows, like Alias, The Office, Parks and Recreation, The West Wing, Felicity, and The Good Place were filmed on location in San Marino.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCalifornia's 25th State Senate district\nHistory of the Chinese Americans in Los Angeles\nGovernor Stoneman Adobe, Los Robles California Historical Landmark\nEl Molino Viejo  California Historical Landmark\n\n\n== References ==\n\nJames T.

          "An excellent museum for a such a small city and country. You is better than any museum I've been to in a city of less than 50,000. There are some interesting paintings with christian settings and the 3 city towers included. The old coins may also be of interest to some people.",
          "If you only see one museum in San Marino, it should be this one! The Sate Museum has four floors of exhibits on various aspects of San Marino from archaeology to paintings to crafts produced in the country. You can learn a lot about San Marino by visiting this museum.",
          "The State museum of San marino is quite something only four floors with all kinds of artefacts on display. They have some beautiful paintings as well. The fun is that the State itself is allready so small that is was quite the surprise....",
          "This museum has different things from art to old archeological objects. I especially remember the painting of Agatha when she gets her breast cut off. She was martyred and the square is named after her. If you like museums this is for you.",
          "The State Museum of San Marino is located inside Palazzo Pergami-Belluzzi located in Piazzetta del Titano, the historic center of San Marino. The museum was established in 1865 in Palazzo Valloni and officially inaugurated in 1899. The current museum location was opened in 2001.",
          "Enjoy art and historical relics related to San Marino in this well organized museum. The personnel is nice and helpful. An audio guide would be helpful however.",
          "If your really into history, facts and ancient times then go. Otherwise, you will probably find it boring. I like learning but found this quite dull. Some English. Felt like I was looking at the same things and was not keeping me interested. There are three small floors. I",
          "The State Museum of San Marino was formed in the second half of the 19th century, based on the donations from all over the world. It is located in the Palazzo Pergami Belluzzi, after its relocation at the beginning of this century. There are numerous archeological findings,",
          "This museum was pretty interesting, just to see San Marino's history. I also loved all the painting which had to do something with San Marino. Only problem was that in some parts of the museum there wasn't any English translation so you just had to guess what it was saying",
          "This is on the combined ticket of for 5 San Marino sights and worth a visit. Check out the violin display. Paganini's violin is there.",
          "I wasn't sure what to expect to see in here, but it's pleasant to spend half an hour or so if you have time. Lots of artifacts from centuries ago, but if you run out of time to catch the bus back to Rimini it's such a nice place to see rather than a must see. I would suggest",
          "This museum displays historical materials of this republic and it is located close to other major attractions of this city.",
          "This museum is pretty pathetic. Its so small and the main thing to see is the parliament. Don't visit unless there's nothing better to do. EUR4.50/- is enough for 3 scoops of gelato.",
          "It's not worth the \u20ac4.50 euros on its own but as part of the combo pass, it's worth popping into. The individual items do not have English translations but the rooms have translated English summaries. There are four floors. Staff are really friendly and I found it interesting",

          "There is a huge cobbled square in front of this. If you are luckly there will be a parade of magnificent pomp when you are there. Im not sure how often it takes place but is truly fantastic to see.",
          "Most of the content does not pertain to San Marino. Very little material is in English. I don't think I learned anything new. It seems like the primary function of this museum is as a jobs program for museum attendants, since I was the only one there. I'm only giving it to",

          "Entrance to the museum is included in the combined ticket for 9 euro (Museo, Palazzo Pubblico, first and second tower). Visit of museum takes 1-2 hours. You can see different exhibits inside from prehistoric to recent times. There is nothing bad but also nothing special or",
          "What a beautiful building, particularly at night when it's all lit up. I was lucky enough to have crystal clear skies, both day and night. Shopping in that area seemed reasonable, although it obviously catered to the tourist.",
          "Its really nice, I got to take a picture with the guards and go for an inside tour. It is a beautiful place.",
          "Changing of the guard is good to watch and there are plenty of shops and restaurants right next door and all of them were cheaper than expected. Wonderful views of the surrounding area, but do not go on a misty or rainy day as you will not see much.",
          "The museum is rather small which I like since you can cover the collections in an hour or two. It gives a good overview of San Marino history with good focus on \"pre-Roman\" era that I find very interesting.",
          "The heart of San Marino, the parliament building houses the current beating heart of the republic, but also tells it's history. Resplendent guards in full regalia welcome you inside this living museum, which is probably the most interesting place to visit in the country.",
          "This museum was surprisingly good considering how small San Marino is. They began soliciting donations some decades ago when the museum was founded and they've been pretty successful. Some decent art, quite a number of old artifacts dating back centuries, and not crowded. We",
          "This is actually an old castle placed right on top of San Marino. The most intereting things to see is the stone architecture and tower. There are a few displays.",
          "It needs more documents of San Marino history although pictures and archeology is good.There is not help with the language offered with your visit but they are washing what you do all the time",
          "Lots of interesting pieces of history - art, stonework, coins, some Etruscan - good mix of periods. Centrally located, lovely building, helpful staff (particuarly the gentleman in the coin area!)",
          "The museum is well laid-out. There is a very small selection of pre-historic (especially Iron Age) material relating directly to the San Marino area, and it is not clearly labelled. I enjoyed the excellent display of the 5th/6th century AD Domagnano treasure, which is very",
          "The place was founded around 300 and is the third smallest state in Europe. It's views from the ramparts must be the world's most beautiful ...anyone in this part of the world should visit. The busses are Euro 9 return from Rimini Railway Station and the food up in the old city",
          "It is free to visit this museum, and they have a great collection of items. There is not enough written in English for me, but I still learned quite a lot about the area.",
          "We travelled in our motorhome, parking was easy and there were passenger lifts to take you upto the entrance to the city. It looked classy, no tacky souvenir shops, brilliant views and all in all, a spectacular place to visit, we were amazed with the place. Well worth visiting",
          "i travelled a lot all over the world. The trip was perfectly well-done . The respublic is very beautiful to see thanks to agency SAMARKANDA located in the centre near Carducci street.I am from Moscow and prefer to travel without tour operators.It is more easier to go alone and",
          "It was anticipated that San Marino might be a tacky tourist trap but it was not and it turned to be a classy and very interesting historic place. There were a few tourist type shops selling 'junk' but overall it was quite spectacular and interesting. The old towers high above",
          "San Marino is the oldest republic in the world; over 1700 years old. It is a country surrounded by Italy near the Italian city of Rimini on the coast of the Adriatic Sea. It has a population of about 32,000 in the entire country. Situated on the top of a huge rock mountain,",
          "Very pretty for a bureaucratic place. Noticeable is the Abe Lincoln words about San Marino. The place is steeped in history.",

          "We were in Reccione, Italy and I couldn't leave until we were actually in San Marino, the city, and the country. The road has lots of twists and turns to get you to the top, and the resulting scenery is impressive, showing the San Marino countryside where the 30,000 citizens of",
          "We went there in between thunderstorms, and were fortunate to see three castles before the rain hit, which was rather dramtic from the tower. The castles are unreal, because they are real. Hold your kid's hands, this is the real thing and gravity works here. Many wlakways",
          "Great castle with cannon, battlements, towers. Climb to the top for a view in all directions of the entire country and surrounding Italy. The access to the top is very tight and two-ways including a narrow ladder. Wait for your turn, it's worth the view. Small fee to enter.",
          "Everything about San Marino was interesting--just enough for a fun weekend. The views are fantastic, good food, good hotel, Be sure to take a jacket--it seems to always be windy. Teleferic ride gives a great view of the country and the sea.",
          "Everything there - in San Marino - is wonderful. You can taka a bus to the city just across the train station Rimini. The ticket is around 9 euro - to the San Marino and back.",
          "I guess it was worth a trip here because there was no entrance fee. The collection is not well-organized however.",
          "I'm astonished to find no-one else has mentioned this museum, because it's outstanding, for its the variety and interest of the objects on display, for the modernity of its approach, and for its general visitor-friendliness. The variety speaks for itself. I remember, for"

        "wiki": "The Sirenusas (Italian: Le Sirenuse), also known as the Gallos (Li Galli, \"the Cocks\"), are an archipelago of little islands off the Amalfi Coast of Italy between Isle of Capri and 6 km (4 mi) southwest of Province of Salerno's Positano, to which it is administratively attached. \nThey are part of the Campanian Archipelago.\nThe name, Sirenuse, is a reference to the mythological sirens said to have lived there.\n\n\n== Extent ==\nThe archipelago consists of three main islands:\n\nGallo Lungo which takes the form of a half-moon,\nLa Castelluccia, also known as Gallo dei Briganti, and\nthe nearly circular La Rotonda.Smaller islets include, nearer the shore,  Isca and, midway between the main islands and Isca, a prominent rocky outcropping that juts above the water, Vetara.\n\n\n== Mythology ==\nSeveral sirens were said to have inhabited the islands, the most famous of whom were Parthenope, Leucosia, and Ligeia. One of them played the lyre, another sang, and another played the flute. They are mentioned in the 1st century BC by Strabo, the Greek Geographer and by Straton of Sardis in 120 AD. In ancient stories, the sirens were depicted as having bodies of a bird and human heads, but the medieval interpretations of the stories depicted them as mermaids.\nThe terms Sirenai and Sirenusai, from the Latin Sirenusae, meaning indicate both the sirens themselves and their residence.\nThe modern name, I Galli or The Cocks, references the bird-like form of the ancient sirens.\n\n\n== History ==\nOriginally the site of an ancient Roman anchorage, in the Middle Ages the islands became medieval fiefdoms of the 13th-century Emperor Frederick II and the Capetian House of Anjou.\n\n\n=== Gallo Lungo ===\nOriginally Gallo Lungo hosted a monastery and then a prison.\nDuring the reign Charles II of Naples (late 13th century), the Amalfi coast became subject to increasing attacks by pirates. To deter them, Charles wished to build a watchtower on top of the remains of a Roman tower on Gallo Lungo. As he lacked sufficient funds he accepted an offer from  Pasquale Celentano of Positano to lend the required funds, in return for being appointed warden of the fortification. The tower (today called the Aragonese Tower) was constructed around 1312  and occupied by a garrison of four soldiers. The wardenship was subsequently passed to Angelo Balbo in 1382 and in 1425 to Viviano Mirelli. Responsibility for the islands then passed to Catalian Gilberto Squanes, the Miroballo family and then to the Marino Mastrogiudice before passing to the crown and then the Marquises of Positano. Eventually with the establishment of the Republic of Italy ownership passed to the town of Positano.  The town later sold the islands to a native of Salerno who sold them to Davide Pariato.In 1919 the Russian choreographer and dancer Leonide Massine sighted the islands while staying with a friend in Positano. In 1922, he purchased Gallo Lungo and began converting it from a place of defense into a private residence.  Initially Massine restored and converted the old Aragonese Tower on Gallo Lungo into accommodation with a dance studio and featuring an open-air theatre. The theatre was subsequently destroyed by a storm.  With design advice from his friend Le Corbusier he constructed a villa on the site of the original Roman structure .  The villa featured the bedrooms facing Positano with a large terrace garden on the first floor facing Cape Licosa and Capri.\nShirley Hazzard in her book Greene on Capri recounts a visit to Massine.\nAfter Massine\u2019s death the islands were purchased in 1988 by Russian dancer Rudolf Nureyev, who spent the last years of his life here. He redecorated  the villa in the Moorish style and clad its interiors with 19th-century tiles from Seville. He also installed a desalinization plant which provided a reliable water supply to and assisted in the development of the gardens,\nAfter Nureyev\u2019s death the islands were purchased from his foundation in 1996 by Giovanni Russo, a Sorrento hotelier who besides using them as a private residence also makes them available for private rental with a staff of 7 and a launch to take guests to and from the mainland.  Members of the public are not allowed to land but can swim in the surrounding waters.\n\n\n=== Isca ===\nThe Neapolitan playwright Eduardo De Filippo purchased this island, which was later owned by his son Luca De Filippo.\nIsca has a  villa and garden on the side facing the cliff (and, thus, not visible if  sailing behind the island). \nThe island was described by the playwright\u2019s wife, Isabella, in a book entitled, In mezzo al mare un'isola c'\u00e8... (\"There is an island in the sea\u2026\").\nThe property has been on and off the market for years, most recently a public listing of the three islands in 2011 was for US$268,000,000.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBerger, Diane (1999).

        "wiki": "Guadalajara (, Spanish: [\u0261wa\u00f0ala\u02c8xa\u027ea] (listen)) is a metropolis in western Mexico and the capital of the state of Jalisco. The city has a population of 1,460,148, while the Guadalajara metropolitan area has a population of 5,002,466, making it the second-largest metropolitan area in the country. Guadalajara has the second highest population density in Mexico, with over 10,361 people per square kilometre. Guadalajara is an international center of business, finance, arts, and culture, as well as the economic center of the Baj\u00edo region, one of the most productive and developed regions in Latin America.Guadalajara is the tenth largest metropolitan area in Latin America and a major Latin American tech hub and financial center. It is one of the most productive and globally competitive cities in the world. The city is an important center for science, technology, finance, culture, innovation, education, business, and tourism in Mexico. It is home to numerous landmarks, including Guadalajara Cathedral, the Teatro Degollado, the Templo Expiatorio, the Hospicio Caba\u00f1as, and the San Juan de Dios Market\u2014the largest indoor market in Latin America.Guadalajara was founded on 14 February 1542 by Crist\u00f3bal de O\u00f1ate, a Basque conquistador, as the capital of the Kingdom of Nueva Galicia, part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. After 1572, the Royal Audiencia of Guadalajara, previously subordinate to Mexico City, became the only authority in New Spain with autonomy over Nueva Galicia, owing to rapidly growing wealth in the kingdom following the discovery of silver. By the 18th century, Guadalajara had taken its place as Mexico's second largest city, following mass colonial migrations in the 1720s and 1760s. During the Mexican War of Independence, independence leader Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla established Mexico's first revolutionary government in Guadalajara in 1810. The city flourished during the Porfiriato, with the advent of the industrial revolution, but its growth was hampered significantly during the Mexican Revolution. In 1929, the Cristero War ended within the confines of the city, when President Plutarco El\u00edas Calles proclaimed the Grito de Guadalajara. The city saw continuous growth throughout the rest of the 20th century, attaining a 1 million metro population in the 1960s and passing 3 million in the 1990s.\nGuadalajara is a global city and one of Mexico's most important cultural centers. It is home to numerous mainstays of Mexican culture, including Mariachi, Tequila, and Birria and hosts numerous notable events, including the Guadalajara International Film Festival, the most important film festival in Latin America, and the Guadalajara International Book Fair, the largest book fair in the Americas. The city was the American Capital of Culture in 2005 and has hosted numerous global events, including the 1970 FIFA World Cup, the 1986 FIFA World Cup, the 1st Ibero-American Summit in 1991, and the 2011 Pan American Games. The city is home to numerous universities and research institutions, including the University of Guadalajara and the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Guadalajara, two of the highest-ranked universities in Mexico and Latin America.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe conquistador, Crist\u00f3bal de O\u00f1ate, named the city in honor of the conqueror of western Mexico, Nu\u00f1o de Guzm\u00e1n, who was born in Guadalajara, Spain. The name comes from the Arabic \u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062c\u0627\u0631\u0629 (w\u0101d\u012b al-\u1e25aj\u0101rah), which means 'Valley of the Stone', or 'Fortress Valley'.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Hispanic Era ===\nUnlike the surrounding areas, the central Atemajac Valley, where Guadalajara is located, contained no human settlements. To the east of the Atemajac Valley were the Tonallan and Tetl\u00e1n peoples. At the extremes were the Zapopan, Atemajac, Zoquipan, Thesistan, Coyula, and Huentit\u00e1n.\nThe historic city center encompasses what was once four population centers, as the villages of the Mezquit\u00e1n, Analco and Mexicaltzingo were annexed to the Atemajac site in 1669.\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\n\nGuadalajara was originally founded at three other sites before moving to its current location. The first settlement in 1532 was in Mesa del Cerro, now known as Nochistl\u00e1n, Zacatecas. This site was settled by Crist\u00f3bal de O\u00f1ate as commissioned by Nu\u00f1o de Guzm\u00e1n, with the purpose of securing recent conquests and defending them from the still-hostile natives. This settlement did not last long due to its lack of usable water sources. In 1533 it was moved to a site near Tonal\u00e1. Four years later, Guzm\u00e1n ordered that the village be moved to Tlacot\u00e1n. During this time, the Spanish king Charles I granted the city the coat of arms which it retains to this day.During the Mixt\u00f3n War, settlers were attacked by the Caxcan, Portecuex, and Zacateco peoples under the command of Tenamaxtli. The war was initiated in response to the cruel treatment of indigenous peoples by Nu\u00f1o de Guzm\u00e1n, in particular the enslavement of captured natives. After multiple defeats, Viceroy Antonio de Mendoza took control of the Spanish campaign to suppress the revolt. The conflict ended after Mendoza made concessions such as freeing Indian slaves and granting amnesty. The village of Guadalajara barely survived the war, and the villagers attributed their survival to the Archangel Michael, who remains the patron of the city to this day.\nAfter the war, the city was moved once again\u2014this time to a more defensible location. This final relocation would prove permanent. In 1542, records indicate that 126 people were living in Guadalajara. That same year, it was granted cityhood by the king of Spain. Guadalajara was officially founded on February 14, 1542 in the Atemajac Valley. The settlement was named for Nu\u00f1o de Guzm\u00e1n's Spanish hometown.In 1559, royal and bishopric offices for the province of Nueva Galicia were moved from Compostela to Guadalajara and, in 1560, Guadalajara became the province's new capital. Construction of the cathedral began in 1563. In 1575, religious orders such as the Augustinians and Dominicans arrived, eventually making the city a center for evangelization efforts.While capital of the Kingdom of Nueva Galicia, the city's inhabitants achieved a high standard of living, due to flourishing industry, agriculture, commerce, mining and trade.\n\nThe Guadalajara of the sixteenth century was a rather small and often overlooked community. It was mainly frequented by traveling merchants. Several epidemics drastically reduced the city's indigenous population, leading to the construction of its first hospital in 1557.\n\nIn 1791, the University of Guadalajara was established. The dedication was held in 1792 at the site of the old Santo Tomas College. While the institution was founded during the 18th century, it would not be fully developed until the 20th century, starting in 1925. In 1794, the Hospital Real de San Miguel de Bel\u00e9n, or simply the Hospital de Bel\u00e9n, was opened.Guadalajara's economy during the 18th century was based on agriculture and the production of non-durable goods such as textiles, shoes and food products.Despite epidemics, plagues, and earthquakes, Guadalajara would become one of the most important population centers in New Spain.\nThe city's heyday attracted numerous architects, philosophers, lawyers, scientists, poets, writers and speakers; Francisco Xavier Clavijero and Mat\u00edas de la Mota Padilla were among the most prominent. 1771 saw the arrival of one of the most notable characters in the history of Guadalajara: Bishop Fray Antonio Alcalde, who founded the Civil Hospital and the University of Guadalajara.\nIn 1793 Mariano Vald\u00e9s T\u00e9llez ran the city's firs printing press, whose first publication was a funeral eulogy for Fray Antonio Alcalde.\n\n\n=== Independence ===\n\nGuadalajara remained the capital of Nueva Galicia with some modifications until the Mexican War of Independence. Miguel Hidalgo entered San Pedro (now Tlaquepaque) on November 25, 1810 and the next day he was greeted effusively in Guadalajara. The city's workers had experienced poor living conditions and were swayed by promises of lower taxes and the abolition of slavery. Despite a soured welcome, due to the rebel army's violence toward city residents, especially royalists, Hidalgo kept his promise and, on December 6, 1810, slavery was abolished in Guadalajara, a proclamation which has been honored since the end of the war. During this time, he founded the newspaper El Despertador Americano, dedicated to the insurgent cause.Royalist forces marched to Guadalajara, arriving in January 1811 with nearly 6,000 men. Insurgents Ignacio Allende and Mariano Abasolo wanted to concentrate their forces in the city and plan an escape route should they be defeated, but Hidalgo rejected this idea. Their second choice was to make a stand at the Puente de Calderon just outside the city. Hidalgo had between 80,000 and 100,000 men and 95 cannons, but the better-trained royalists won, decimating the insurgent army and forcing Hidalgo to flee toward Aguascalientes. Guadalajara remained in royalist hands until near the end of the war.'\n\nOn January 17, 1817, the insurgent army was again defeated on the outskirts of Guadalajara in the Battle of Calder\u00f3n Bridge.\nNew Galicia, now Jalisco, adhered to the Plan de Iguala on June 13, 1821.\nIn 1823, Guadalajara became capital of the newly founded state of Jalisco. In 1844, General Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga initiated a revolt against the government of President Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna. Santa Anna personally ensured that the revolt was quelled. However, while Santa Anna was in Guadalajara, a revolt called the Three Hour Revolution brought Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Herrera to the presidency and put Santa Anna into exile.President Benito Ju\u00e1rez made Guadalajara the seat of his government in 1856, during the Reform War. French troops entered the city during the French Intervention in 1864, and it was retaken by Mexican troops in 1866.Despite the violence, the 19th century was a period of economic, technological and social growth for the city. After Independence, small-scale industries developed, many of which were owned by European immigrants. Rail lines connecting the city to the Pacific coast and north to the United States intensified trade and allowed the shipment of products from rural areas of Jalisco. Ranch Culture became a very important aspect of Jalisco and Guadalajara's identities during this time. From 1884 to 1890, electrical and railroad services, as well as the Guadalajara Observatory were established.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nThroughout the twentieth century, seeing growth in its industrial, tourist and service industries, Guadalajara began a period of rapid transformation into the metropolis it is today. The city would gain the second largest economy in Mexico, following only by Mexico City. After the Mexican Revolution of 1910, Guadalajara became the second most populous city in the country. However, the decades that followed brought a number of regional wars in the states of Jalisco, Michoac\u00e1n, and Guanajuato. The aftermath of the Great Depression took further toll on the city. Fortunately, by the 1940s the city would experience industrial, demographic, and trade growth.\nIn 1910, the Mexican Revolution began, bringing an end to the Porfiriato. With conflict concentrated in the capital, Guadalajara experienced relative calm. After the Cristero Conflict, peace returned to Guadalajara and the city flourished, outgrowing its colonial roots. This period saw the birth of new schools of architecture that would decorate the city from the 1920s to the 1980s.\n\nGuadalajara again experienced substantial growth after the 1930s, and the first industrial park was established in 1947. Its population surpassed one million in 1964, and by the 1970s it was Mexico's second-largest city and the largest in western Mexico. Most of the modern city's urbanization took place between the 1940s and the 1980s, with the population doubling every ten years until it stood at 2.5 million in 1980. The population of the municipality has stagnated, and even declined, slowly but steadily, since the early 1990s.The increase in population brought with it an increase in the size of what is now called Greater Guadalajara, rather than an increase in the population density of the city. Migrants coming into Guadalajara from the 1940s to the 1980s were mostly from rural areas and lived in the city center until they had enough money to buy property. This property was generally bought in the edges of the city, which were urbanizing into fraccionamientos, or residential areas. In the 1980s, it was described as a \"divided city\" east to west based on socioeconomic class. Since then, the city has evolved into four sectors, which are still more or less class-centered. The upper classes tend to live in Hidalgo and Ju\u00e1rez in the northwest and southwest, while lower classes tend to live in the city center, Libertad in the northeast and southeast in Reforma. However, lower class development has developed on the city's periphery and upper and middle classes are migrating toward Zapopan, making the situation less neatly divided.\n\nSince 1996, the activity of multinational corporations has had a significant effect on the economic and social development of the city. The presence of companies such as Kodak, Hewlett-Packard, Motorola and IBM has been based on production facilities built outside the city proper, bringing in foreign labor and capital. This was made possible in the 1980s by surplus labor, infrastructure improvements and government incentives. These companies focus on electrical and electronic items, which is now one of Guadalajara's two main products (the other being beer). This has internationalized the economy, steering it away from manufacturing and toward services, dependent on technology and foreign investment. This has not been favorable for the unskilled working class and traditional labor sectors.\n\nThe 1992 Guadalajara explosions occurred on April 22, 1992, when gasoline explosions in the sewer system over four hours destroyed 8 km (5 mi) of streets in the downtown district of Analco. Gante Street was the most damaged. Officially, 206 people were killed, nearly 500 injured and 15,000 were left homeless. The estimated monetary damage ranges between $300 million and $1 billion. The affected areas can be recognized by their more modern architecture.Three days before the explosion, residents started complaining of a strong gasoline-like smell coming from the sewers. City workers were dispatched to check the sewers and found dangerously high levels of gasoline fumes. However, no evacuations were ordered. An investigation into the disaster found that there were two precipitating causes. The first was new water pipes that were built too close to an existing gasoline pipeline. Chemical reactions between the pipes caused erosion. The second was a flaw in the sewer design that did not allow accumulated gases to escape.Arrests were made to indict those responsible for the blasts. Four officials of Pemex (the state oil company) were indicted and charged on the basis of negligence. Ultimately, however, these people were cleared of all charges. Calls for the restructuring of PEMEX were made but they were successfully resisted.The 1990s were marked by events such as the explosions of April 22, 1992, the Mexican peso crisis of 1994, and the murder of the Cardinal Juan Jes\u00fas Posadas Ocampo in 1993. The 1992 explosions caused massive infrastructure damage to hundreds of houses, avenues, streets, and businesses in the Analco colony, \"without a clear delineator of information and responsibilities to date,\" in one of the most tragic events in the history of Guadalajara. The investigation of the facts lasted more than 11 years in which insufficient evidence was found to appoint a manager, investigations are now closed attributing the events to an accident. This event, in addition to Mexico's 1994 economic crisis, resulted in the loss of Guadalajara's industrial power.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nThe city has hosted numerous important international events, such as the first Cumbre Iberoamericana in 1991; the Third Summit of Heads of State and Governments of Latin America, the Caribbean and the European Union in 2004; the Encuentro Internacional de Promotores y Gestores Culturales in 2005; and the 2011 Pan American Games. It was named the American Capital of Culture in 2005 and the Ciudad Educadora (Educator City). in 2006. It was recognized as Mexico's first Smart City due to its use of developing technology. \nDuring each government period, the city went through structural plans with which new areas and commercial hubs were born and with which transnational corporations and international industries arrived in the city. The city housed the first shopping malls in Mexico. \nThe city expanded rapidly before merging with the Zapopan municipality. Among the developments created during this period were the Guadalajara Expo, the light rail, shopping centers, the expansion of streets and avenues, and the birth and development of road infrastructure, services, tourism, industrial, etc. The first shopping center in Latin America emerged in the city, the first urban electric-train system in Latin America, and the first autonomous university in Mexico.A 2007 survey entitled \"Cities of the Future\", FDi magazine ranked Guadalajara first among major Mexican cities and second among major North American cities in terms of economic potential, behind Chicago. The magazine also rated it as the most business-friendly Latin American city in 2007.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Guadalajara has a humid subtropical climate (Cwa) that is quite close to a tropical climate, featuring dry, warm winters and hot, wet summers. Guadalajara's climate is influenced by its high altitude and the general seasonality of precipitation patterns in western North America.\nAlthough the temperature is warm year-round, Guadalajara has very strong seasonal variation in precipitation. The northward movement of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone brings a great deal of rain in the summer months, whereas, for the rest of the year, the climate is rather dry. The extra moisture in the wet months moderates the temperatures, resulting in cooler days and nights during this period. The highest temperatures are usually reached in May averaging 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F), but can reach up to 37 \u00b0C (99 \u00b0F) just before the onset of monsoon season. March tends to be the driest month and July the wettest, with an average of 273 millimetres (10.7 in) of rain, over a quarter of the annual average of about 1,002 millimetres (39.4 in).\nDuring the summer, afternoon storms are very common and can sometimes bring hail flurries to the city, especially toward late August or September. Winters are relatively warm despite the city's altitude, with January daytime temperatures reaching about 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) and nighttime temperatures about 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F). However, the outskirts of the city (generally those close to the Primavera Forest) experience on average cooler temperatures than the city itself. There, temperatures around 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) can be recorded during the coldest nights. Frost may also occur during the coldest nights, but temperatures rarely fall below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) in the city, making it an uncommon phenomenon. Cold fronts in winter can sometimes bring light rain to the city for several days in a row. Snowfall is extraordinarily rare, with the last recorded one occurring in December 1997, which was the first time in 116 years, as it had previously last fallen in 1881.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nGuadalajara's natural wealth is represented by the La Primavera Forest, Los Colomos, and the Barranca de Huentit\u00e1n. The flora in these areas includes michoacan pines, several species of oak, sweetgum, ash, willow, and introduced trees such as poincianas, jacarandas and ficus.  It also includes orchids, roses and various species of fungi. The fauna includes typical urban fauna in addition to 106 species of mammals, 19 species of reptiles and six species of fish.La Barranca de Huentit\u00e1n (the Huentit\u00e1n Forest) (also known as Barranca de Oblatos and Barranca de Oblatos-Huentit\u00e1n) is a National Park located just north of the municipality of Guadalajara. The barranca (canyon) borders two colonias (neighborhoods) of the city, Oblatos and Huentitan.\nIt covers approximately 1,136 hectares, and varies 600 meters in altitude. The funicular railway in the park starts at 1000 meters above sea level and rises to 1520 meters above sea level. In the 16th century, during the Spanish Conquest, the Huentit\u00e1n area including the canyon was the site of battles between local Indian populations and the Spanish.  Later, it was the site of battles between different factions during the Mexican Revolution and the Cristero Rebellion.\n\nThe canyon is a biogeographic corridor which is home to four types of vegetation: deciduous tropical forest, gallery forest, heath vegetation and secondary vegetation. In addition to introduced species, there are many native species of flora and fauna. The canyon is studied by national and international researchers as it contains great biological diversity due to its geographical location.\nOn June 5, 1997 it was declared a Protected Natural Area, as an Area Subject to Ecological Conservation (Zona Sujeta a Conservaci\u00f3n Ecol\u00f3gica).\nLa Cascada Cola de Caballo (The Horse Tail Waterfall) is located on the Guadalajara to Zacatecas road (Highway 54, km 15) a few kilometers from the Northern Peripheral, just after passing the village of San Esteban. The waterfall is fed by a stream from the Atemajac Valley. It is close to Guadalajara and a town with very little development, and as a result of poor ecological practices it is very polluted.\nEl Bosque los Colomos, the Colomos Forest, is located in the northwestern part of Guadalajara along the Rio Atemajac. It is in a wealthy part of the metropolitan area, and has been developed for recreation rather than being preserved in its wild state. The river was once one of the main sources of water supply to the city, and today continues to provide water to some surrounding colonias (neighborhoods). Currently, this forest covers an area of 92 hectares in which pine trees, eucalyptus trees and cedars predominate. The park has jogging tracks, gardens (including a Japanese garden), ponds, a bird lake, instructional areas for school field days, playgrounds, camping areas, and horses to ride.\nOther places of interest around Guadalajara include Camachos Aquatic Natural Park, a commercial water park, and Barranca Colimilla, a beautiful canyon with hiking trails near Tonala, east of Guadalajara.\n\n\n=== Urbanism ===\n Guadalajara's street plan has evolved over time into a radial urban plan, with five major routes into and out of the city.  It is surrounded by ring roads. \nThe original city of Guadalajara was planned on a grid, with north-south and east-west intersecting streets.\nOver time, villages surrounding Guadalajara were incorporated into the city - first Analco to the southeast, then Mexicaltzingo to the south, Mezquitan to the north and San Juan de Dios to the east, all of which introduced more variety to the plan.  As it grew towards the west, it kept the original north-south orientation.  As it grew towards the east, this grid was tilted towards the south-east to match up with the grids of the former towns Analco and San Juan de Dios, across the river from central Guadalajara on the eastern side of Rio San Juan de Dios (Rio San Juan de Dios is now underground; it runs beneath Calzada Independencia).    \n\n \nWhen the railway was introduced to Guadalajara in 1888, the southern part of the city began development, and its streets aligned with the grid to the east of the old Rio San Juan de Dios.  Additional 20th century expansion of the city introduced even more variety, as developers introduced different kinds of non-grid street plans in new areas.\n\nDuring the government of Jos\u00e9 de Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez Gallo, between 1947 and 1953, major public works changed the urban landscape of the historic center of the city.\nMajor controversial projects included the widening of Avenida 16 de Septiembre and Avenida Ju\u00e1rez, which were no longer adequate to handle car traffic in the center of the city. In the process, many buildings of architectural and historical value were demolished. Historical buildings around Guadalajara Cathedral were also demolished to leave large open spaces on the four sides of the Cathedral in the form of a large Latin cross, in which the Cathedral is now centered.  There were other, somewhat less controversial, projects to improve the flow of traffic and increase commerce in other parts of the city.\n\n\n=== Districts ===\n\nGuadalajara is made up of more than 2300 colonias (neighborhoods) in the Metropolitan Area. The oldest parts of the city include colonia Centro (the oldest in the city), Santuario, Mexicaltzingo, Mezquitan, Analco, and San Juan de Dios. Private houses in the oldest sector of the city are mostly made up of one and two level houses, with architectural styles ranging from simple colonial architecture to the Churrigueresco, Baroque and early nineteenth century European styles. \nJust west of the oldest part of the city are upper-class colonias built in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, containing the neoclassical structures and houses of the Porfiriato. In the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s and 1950s well-to-do Tapatios expanded into colonias Lafayette, Americana, Moderna, and Arcos Vallarta. New architectural trends of the 1960s and 1970s also left their mark in colonias such as Colonia Americana, Vallarta Poniente, Moderna, Providencia, Vallarta San Jorge, Forest Gardens, and Chapalita.  \n\nThe Metropolitan Area has more wealthy neighborhoods than any other part of western Mexico. These colonias are located both inside and outside the municipality of Guadalajara, including some in its neighboring municipalities of Zapopan and Tlajomulco, in the west and south. Some of these colonias are: Colinas de San Javier, Puerta de Hierro, Providencia, Chapalita, Jardines de San Ignacio, Ciudad del Sol, Valle Real, Lomas del Valle, Santa Rita, Monraz, Santa Anita Golf Club, El Cielo, Santa Isabel, Virreyes, Bugambilias, Las Ca\u00f1adas, and The Stay.\n\nIn general, residents in the west of the city are the wealthiest, while residents in the east are the poorest. \nNew development to accommodate the growing population is made up of a mix of middle-class colonias and housing complexes developed as part of government plans, and colonias developed less formally for working class people.  The Metropolitan Area extends to the west in colonias such as Pinar de la Calma, Las Fuentes, Paseos del Sol, El Colli Urbano, and La Estancia and extends to the east in colonias such as St. John Bosco, St. Andrew, Oblates, St. Onofre, Insurgents, Gardens of Peace, and Garden of Poets.\nThe expansion of the population creates a constant demand for more colonias and more government infrastructure services.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\n\nParks and forests are important in Guadalajara; while many of the oldest neighborhoods of the municipality of Guadalajara do not have sufficient green spaces, of the three most important metropolitan areas in Mexico, the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area (ZMG) has the most green areas and plants. \nThe most important parks are:\n\nGardens (Jard\u00ednes)\nParks (Parques)\nForests (Bosques)\nZoos (Zool\u00f3gicos)\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe most current figures by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI), confirmed in 2010, the municipality of Guadalajara has a population of approximately 1,495,189, with a population in the metropolitan area of 4,334,878, the most populous city in the state of Jalisco, the most conurbation-highest-population within the province of Jalisco. of the Guadalajara metropolitan area, and the second most populous city in Mexico; the first is Mexico City.\nIn 2007, the United Nations listed the world's 100 most populous urban agglomerations. Mexico excelled with three cities on the list: Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey. Guadalajara ranked 66th in these cities, followed by Sydney and Washington, D.C. On the Latin American list, Guadalajara ranked 10th.\nThe municipality of Guadalajara is located in the center of the State, a little to the east, at coordinates 20-&36' 40\" to 20- 45' 00\" north latitude and 103- 16' 00\" to 103- 24' 00\" west-latitude and 103-&16' 00\" to 103- 24' 00\" west-west longitude, at a height of 1700 meters above sea level.\nThe municipality of Guadalajara is bounded to the north by Zapopan and Ixtlahuac\u00e1n del R\u00edo, to the east by Tonal\u00e1 (Jalisco)' Tonal\u00e1 and Zapotlanejo, to the south with Tlaquepaque and to the west with Zapopan.\n\n\n=== Guadalajara Metropolitan Area ===\n\nThe Guadalajara metropolitan area is the second most populous metropolitan area in the country and has six central and three exterior municipalities. The central municipalities are Guadalajara, Zapopan, Tlaquepaque, Tonal\u00e1, Tlajomulco de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga and El Salto, Jalisco. The exterior municipalities are Ixtlahuac\u00e1n de los Membrillos, Juanacatl\u00e1n and Zapotlanejo.\n\nThe growth of the city is due to Guadalajara absorbing the closest communities. This was the case with the former communities Atemajac, Huentit\u00e1n, Tetl\u00e1n, Analco, Mexicaltzingo, Mezquitan and San Andr\u00e9s, among others.\nSome of the closest communities to Guadalajara:\n\nIxtlahuac\u00e1n del R\u00edo (21.7 km from the municipal seat of Guadalajara,20\u00b051\u203248.96\u2033N 103\u00b014\u203222.57\u2033W).\nSanta Anita (19.6 km from Guadalajara's municipal seat,  20\u00b032\u203259.09\u2033N 103\u00b026\u203229.50\u2033W).\nSanta Cruz de las Flores (27.9 km from the municipal seat of Guadalajara,20\u00b028\u203249.33\u2033N 103\u00b030\u203229.09\u2033W).\nNuevo M\u00e9xico (14 km from municipal seat of Guadalajara, 20\u00b045\u203247.02\u2033N 103\u00b026\u203227.24\u2033W).\nTesist\u00e1n (20,8 km from the municipal seat of Guadalajara, 20\u00b047\u203254.91\u2033N 103\u00b028\u203239.85\u2033W).\nLa Primavera (24.4 km from the municipal seat of Guadalajara,20\u00b037\u203259.25\u2033N 103\u00b033\u203235.37\u2033W).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nGuadalajara has the third-largest economy and industrial infrastructure in Mexico and contributes 37% of the state of Jalisco's total gross production. Its economic base is strong and well diversified, mainly based on commerce and services, although the manufacturing sector plays a defining role. It is ranked in the top ten in Latin America in gross domestic product and the third highest ranking in Mexico. \nIn its 2007 survey entitled \"Cities of the Future\", FDi magazine ranked Guadalajara highest among major Mexican cities and designated Guadalajara as having the second strongest economic potential of any major North American city behind Chicago. FDI ranked it as the most business-friendly Latin American city in 2007.In 2009 Moody's Investors Service assigned ratings of Ba1 (Global scale, local currency) and A1.mx (Mexican national scale). During the prior five years, the municipality's financial performance had been mixed but had begun to stabilize in the later two years. Guadalajara manages one of the largest budgets among Mexican municipalities and its revenue per capita indicator (Ps. $2,265) places it above the average for Moody's-rated municipalities in Mexico.The city's economy has two main sectors. Commerce and tourism employ most: about 60% of the population. The other is industry, which has been the engine of economic growth and the basis of Guadalajara's economic importance nationally even though it employs only about a third of the population. Industries here produce products such as food and beverages, toys, textiles, auto parts, electronic equipment, pharmaceuticals, footwear, furniture and steel products.Two of the major industries have been textiles and shoes, which are still dynamic and growing. Sixty percent of manufactured products are sold domestically, while forty percent are exported, mostly to the United States. This makes Guadalajara's economic fortunes dependent on those of the U.S., both as a source of investment and as a market for its goods.In 2007, fDi magazine stated that Guadalajara has the second strongest economic potential of any major North American city, behind only Chicago. The same research noted Guadalajara as a \"city of the future\" due to its youthful population, low unemployment and large number of recent foreign investment deals; it was found to be the third most business-friendly city in North America.The city has to compete with China, especially for electronics industries which rely on high volume and low wages. This has caused the it to move toward high-mix, mid-volume and value-added services, such as automotives. However, its traditional advantage of proximity to the U.S. market is one reason Guadalajara stays competitive. Mexico ranked third in 2009 in Latin America for the export of information technology services, behind Brazil and Argentina. This kind of service is mostly related to online and telephone technical support. The major challenge this sector has is the lack of university graduates who speak English.\n\n\n=== Technology ===\n\nThe electronics and information technology sectors that have nicknamed the city the \"Silicon Valley of Mexico\". Guadalajara is the main producer of software, electronic and digital components in Mexico. Telecom and computer equipment from Guadalajara accounts for about a quarter of Mexico's electronics exports. Companies such as General Electric, IBM, SANMINA, Intel Corporation, Freescale Semiconductor, Hitachi Ltd., Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP Inc, Siemens, Flextronics, Oracle, Wipro, TCS, Cognizant Technology Solutions and Jabil Circuit have facilities in the city or its suburbs. This phenomenon began after the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). International firms started building facilities in Mexico, especially Guadalajara, displacing Mexican firms, especially in information technology. One of the problems this has created is that when there are economic downturns, these international firms scale back.Guadalajara was selected as \"Smart City\" in 2013 by IEEE, the world's largest professional association for the advancement of technology.\nSeveral cities invest in the areas of research to design pilot projects and as an example, in early March in 2013 was the first \"Cluster Smart Cities \" in the world, composed Dublin, Ireland; San Jos\u00e9, California; Cardiff, Wales, and Guadalajara, Jalisco, whose objective is the exchange of information and experiences that can be applied in principle to issues of agribusiness and health sciences.\nThe Secretariat of Communications and Transportation also reported that Guadalajara, Jalisco was chosen as the official venue for the first \"Digital Creative City of Mexico and Latin America\", what will be the spearhead for our country to consolidate the potential in this area.\nThe \"Cluster Smart Cities\" unprecedented in the world, will focus on what each of these cities is making in innovation and the creation of an alliance to attract technology. The Ministry of Innovation, Science and Technology (SICyT ) of Jalisco, said the combination of talent development investments allow Jalisco enter the \"knowledge economy\" .\nFrom 25 to 28 October 2015, the city was the venue for the first conference of the Smart Cities Initiative.\n\n\n=== Industries ===\nMost of the economy revolves around commerce, employing 60% of the population. This activity has mainly focused on the purchase and sale of the following products: food and beverages, textiles, electronic appliances, tobacco, cosmetics, sport articles, construction materials and others. Guadalajara's commercial activity is second only to Mexico City.\n\nGlobalization and neoliberal reforms have affected the form and distribution of commerce in Guadalajara since the early 1990s. This has led to tensions between traditional markets, such as the Mercardo Libertad, and retailers such as department stores and supermarkets. Local governments in the metropolitan area used to invest in and heavily regulate traditional markets but this is no longer the case. To attract private corporate investment, regulatory control eased and most commercial developments now are controlled by private concerns.\n\nThe city is the national leader in the development and investment of shopping malls. Many shopping centers have been built, such as Plaza Galerias, one of the largest shopping centers in Latin America, and Andares. Galer\u00edas Guadalajara covers 160,000 m2 (1,722,225.67 sq ft) and has 220 stores. It contains the two largest movie theaters in Latin America, both with IMAX screens. It hosts art exhibits and fashion shows, and has an area for cultural workshops. Anchor stores includes Liverpool and Sears and specialty stores such as Hugo Boss, Max Mara and Lacoste, Tesla MotorsCostco. Best Buy opened its first Guadalajara store here. It has an additional private entrance on the top floor of the adjacent parking lot. Another Best Buy store was inaugurated in Ciudadela Lifestyle Center mall, which was the chain's third-largest in the world, according to the company.\nAndares is another important commercial center in Zapopan. This $530 million mixed-use complex opened in 2008, designed by renowned Mexican Sordo Madaleno architecture firm features luxury residences and a high-level mall anchored by two large department stores, Liverpool and El Palacio de Hierro. The 133,000 m2 (1,400,000+ sq ft) mall offers hundreds of stores, a big food court located on the second floor and several restaurants at the Paseo Andares.\nA large segment of the commercial sector caters to tourists and other visitors. Recreational tourism is mainly concentrated in the historic downtown. In addition to being a cultural and recreational attraction and thanks to its privileged geographical location, the city serves as an axis to nearby popular beach destinations such as Puerto Vallarta, Manzanillo and Mazatl\u00e1n. Other types of visitors include those who travel to attend seminars, conventions and other events in fields such as academic, entertainment, sports and business. The best-known venue for this purposes is the Expo Guadalajara, a large convention center surrounded by several hotels. It was built in 1987, and it is considered the most important convention center in Mexico.\n\n\n=== Foreign trade ===\n\nMost of Guadalajara's economic growth since 1990 has been tied with foreign investment. International firms have invested here to take advantage of the relatively cheap but educated and highly productive labor, establishing manufacturing plants that re-export their products to the United States, as well as provide goods for the internal Mexican market.A media report in early October 2013 stated that five major Indian IT (information technology) companies have established offices in Guadalajara, while several other Indian IT companies continue to explore the option of expanding to Mexico.

The Temple of San Juan de Dios, a Baroque church built in the 17th century, is next to the market.\n\nAt the far east end is the Plaza de los Mariachis and the Ex-Hospicio Caba\u00f1as. The Plaza de los Mariachis is faced by restaurants where one can hear live mariachis play, especially at night. The Ex-Hospicio Caba\u00f1as extends along the entire east side of the Plaza. This building was constructed by Manuel Tols\u00e1 beginning in 1805 under orders of Carlos III. It was inaugurated and began its function as an orphanage in 1810, in spite of the fact that it would not be finished until 1845. It was named after Bishop Ruiz de Caba\u00f1as y Crespo.

The connection between the city and mariachi began in 1907 when an eight-piece mariachi band and four dancers from the city performed on stage at the president's residence for both Porfirio D\u00edaz and the Secretary of State of the United States. This made the music a symbol of west Mexico, and after the migration of many people from the Guadalajara area to Mexico City (mostly settling near Plaza Garibaldi), it then became a symbol of Mexican identity as wellGuadalajara hosts the Festival of Mariachi and Charreria, which began in 1994. It attracts people in the fields of art, culture and politics from Mexico and abroad.

Over 750 mariachi musicians play traditional melodies on the plaza, and along with the restaurants and other businesses, the plaza supports more than 830 families.\n\nA recent innovation has been the fusion of mariachi melodies and instruments with rock and roll performed by rock musicians in the Guadalajara area. An album collecting a number of these melodies was produced called \"Mariachi Rock-O\". There are plans to take these bands on tour in Mexico, the United States and Europe.The city is also host to several dance and ballet companies such as the Chamber Ballet of Jalisco, the Folkloric Ballet of the University of Guadalajara, and University of Guadalajara Contemporary Ballet.\nThe city is home to a renowned symphony orchestra. The Orquesta Filarm\u00f3nica de Jalisco (Jalisco Philharmonic Orchestra) was founded by Jos\u00e9 Rol\u00f3n in 1915. It held concerts from that time until 1924, when state funding was lost. However, the musicians kept playing to keep the orchestra alive. This eventually caught the attention of authorities and funding was restated in 1939. Private funding started in the 1940s and in 1950, an organization called Conciertos Guadalajara A. C. was formed to continue fundraising for the orchestra. In 1971, the orchestra became affiliated with the Department of Fine Arts of the State of Jalisco. The current name was adopted in 1988/ International soloists such as Paul Badura-Skoda, Claudio Arrau, J\u00f6rg Demus, Henryck Szeryng, Nicanor Zabaleta, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, Kurt Rydl and Alfred Brendel have performed with the organization.

But one that totally sets it apart from the whole country are the \"Torta Ahogada \", which is of salted birote (typical bread [tapat\u00edo]) smeared with refried beans, with fried pork cut into pieces \u2013 also known as \"carnitas\" \u2013 all in sauce tomato seasoned with spices; it is also eaten accompanied by onions deflated in lemon and hot sauce; to drink, it can be accompanied either with the famous tejuino \u2013 which is made with a base of sourdough corn, accompanied by lemon ice cream \u2013 or with the tepache (made from the bark of fermented pineapple). The cuisine is a mix of pre-Hispanic and Spanish influences, like the rest of Mexico, but dishes have their own flavors and are made with local techniques.\nAnother typical meal of Guadalajara and the entire state of Jalisco is the \"birria\", which is usually made with either pork, beef, or goat. Handcrafted birria is made in a special oven, which can be underground and covered with maguey leaves; the meat can be mixed with a tomato broth and spices, or consumed separately. The traditional way of preparing birria is to pit roast the meat and spices wrapped in maguey leaves. It is served in bowls with minced onion, limes and tortillas. \n\nAnother typical dish of the tapat\u00eda kitchen is the carne en su jugo This dish consists of a beef broth with beans from the pot and is accompanied by bacon, coriander, onion and radish (sliced or whole). The dessert that is considered as a typical tapat\u00edo is the jericalla.\nWhen the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the Aztec empire, a few religious ceremonies included eating pozole made with hominy and human flesh. This was the first type of pozole mentioned in Spanish writing, as a ritual dish eaten only by select priests and noblemen. The meat from the thighs of slain enemy warriors was used. The Franciscan missionaries ended this custom when they banned Aztec religious ceremonies. The pozole in the local common cuisine was related to the ritual dish, but prepared with turkey meat, and later pork, not with human flesh.\n\nOther dishes that are popular here include pozole, a soup prepared with hominy, pork or chicken, topped with cabbage, radishes, minced onions and other condiments; pipi\u00e1n, which is a sauce prepared with peanuts, squash and sesame seed, and bi\u00f3nico, a popular local dessert.\nJericallas are a typical Guadalajara dessert that is similar to flan, that was created to give children proper nutrients while being delicious. It is made with eggs, milk, sugar, vanilla and cinnamon, and baked in the oven where it is broiled to the point that a burnt layer is produced. The burnt layer at the surface is what makes this dessert special and delicious.One of the drinks that is popular in Guadalajara is Tejuino, a refreshing drink that contains a corn fermented base with sugarcane, lime, salt and chili powder.The city hosts the Feria Internacional Gastronom\u00eda (International Gastronomy Fair) each year in September showcasing Mexican and international cuisines. Many restaurants, bars, bakeries and caf\u00e9s participate as well as producers of beer, wine and tequila.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nGuadalajara is home to four professional football teams; Guadalajara, also known as Chivas, Atlas, C.D.

Every September 15, charros make a parade in the downtown streets to celebrate the Charro and Mariachi Day.Guadalajara hosted the 2011 Pan American Games. Since winning the bid to host the Games, the city had been undergoing extensive renovations. The games brought in more than 5,000 athletes from approximately 42 countries from the Americas and the Caribbean. Sports included aquatics, football, racquetball and 27 more, with six others being considered. COPAG (the Organizing Committee for the Pan American Games Guadalajara 2011) had a total budget of US$250 million with the aim of updating the city's sports and general infrastructure. The center of the city was repaved and new hotels were constructed for the approximately 22,000 rooms that were needed in 2011. The new bus rapid transit (BRT) system, Macrob\u00fas, was launched in March and runs along Avenida Independencia. The Pan-American village was built around the Bajio Zone. After the Games, the buildings will be used for housing. There are already 13 existing venues in Guadalajara that the games will use, including the Jalisco Stadium, UAG 3 de Marzo Stadium, and the UAG Gymnasium. Eleven new sporting facilities were created for the event. Other works included a second terminal in the airport, a highway to Puerto Vallarta and a bypass for the southern part of the city.Lorena Ochoa, a retired and former #1 female golfer, Formula One driver Sergio P\u00e9rez who drives for Racing Point F1 Team and Javier \"Chicharito\" Hern\u00e1ndez, a forward who currently plays for LA Galaxy and the Mexico national team were also born in the city.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAs the capital of the state, the city is the seat of the state's government. As a result, state politics have a heavy influence in local decision-making and vice versa. Historically, the mayorship of the city has been a common leaping platform for the state governorship. Additionally, because of the sheer size of the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the state, the city's urban agglomeration\u2014largely dominated and coordinated by the Guadalajara city council\u2014captures 12 of the 20 seats in the state legislature allocated by district.\nAll three branches of the state government are concentrated around the historic city center, with the Palace of Government, seat of the state executive, immediately southeast of the Cathedral. North, across the Plaza de la Liberaci\u00f3n, is the State Legislature Building, and immediately east of the latter is the Supreme Tribunal of State Justice.\n\nLike other municipalities in Mexico, Guadalajara is governed by a municipal president, who exercises executive power for three consecutive years. This office is currently occupied by Enrique Alfaro (Movimiento Ciudadano). \n\nThe legislature has the cabildo, formed by the form chosen by the candidate for mayor, made up of aldermen, who are not elected by the people by direct or indirect voting, but the return happens automatically if the mayor wins.\nThe municipality is divided into five electoral districts for the purpose of election of representatives of the city in the federal legislature. These districts are the VIII, IX, XI, XIII and XIV of the state of Jalisco.\nThe city and the municipality of Guadalajara are essentially co extensive with over 99% of the municipality living within the city limits and nearly all of the municipality urbanized. Urbanization centered on the city spreads out over seven other municipalities; of Zapopan, Tlaquepaque, Tonal\u00e1, Tlajomulco de Zu\u00f1iga, El Salto, Ixtlahuac\u00e1n de los Membrillos and Juanacatl\u00e1n.These areas form the \"Guadalajara Metropolitan Area\" (Zona Metropolitana de Guadalajara in Spanish), which is the most populous in the state of Jalisco and the second most populous in the country after the Mexico City Metropolitan area. This metropolitan area had a population of 4,298,715 in 2008.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nGuadalajara is an important hub for higher education in both Mexico and Latin America, as the home to numerous nationally and internationally ranked universities and research centers.\nThe most important is the University of Guadalajara, which was established on October 12, 1791, by royal decree. The entity underwent a number of reorganizations since then, but the modern university as it exists today was established in 1925, when the governor of Jalisco convened professors, students and others to re-establish the university. These precepts were organized into a law called the \"Ley Organica\". It was ranked fifth among the best Mexican universities in 2012.\n\nGuadalajara is home to Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Guadalajara (UAG), which was founded in 1935 and is the oldest private university in Mexico, and Universidad del Valle de Atemajac (UNIVA), and the Western Institute of Technology and Higher Education.\nThe city hosts campuses of several private schools, including:\n\nUniversidad Panamericana\nUniversidad La Salle\nITESO\nMonterrey Institute of Technology\nGuadalajara Metropolitan Technological University\nUniversidad del Valle de M\u00e9xico\nUniversidad Marista de Guadalajara\nUniversidad Tecnol\u00f3gica de Guadalajara\nUniversidad del Valle de AtemajacIn addition, the city hosts numerous international schools, including:\n\nAmerican School Foundation of Guadalajara (ASFG)\nLyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais de Guadalajara\nColegio Alem\u00e1n de Guadalajara\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nGuadalajara is well connected by a number of modern highways. These include Fed 15, which connects the city northwestward to Nogales, Sonora, via Tepic, Nayarit and eastwards to Mexico City via Morelia; Fed 80D which runs northwest toward Aguascalientes; and Fed 54D which runs southward to the coast via Colima. The city's well connected transportation infrastructure allows easy access to Mexico City, to the northwest and to the major beach resorts of Manzanillo, Mazatl\u00e1n and Puerto Vallarta to the southwest, northwest, and west, respectively.\nThe Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla Guadalajara International Airport, also known as Guadalajara International Airport (ICAO code: MMGL) opened in 1966. It is located 16 km (10 mi) south of downtown Guadalajara, and it was built on the Tlajomulco de Zu\u00f1iga city, near Chapala. The airport is the third most active in the country (after Mexico City and Canc\u00fan) with direct flights to many Mexican and American cities.Within the city itself, there are many forms of public transportation. The Guadalajara light rail/metro system, named SITEUR (Sistema de Tren El\u00e9ctrico Urbano), Spanish for Urban Electrical Train System, provides rapid transit service within Guadalajara and the neighboring municipalities of Zapopan and Tlaquepaque. It consists of two lines: line 1, running from north to south, with 19 stations, and line 2, running from downtown to the east, with 10 stations. The trains are electric and have a top speed of 70 km/h (43 mph). The 48 articulated cars currently in service were built in Mexico by Concarril/Bombardier. Construction on a third line began in 2014. Line 3 will run from Zapopan, in the northwest, to Tlaquepaque and Tonal\u00e1, in the southeast, via the city center.\n\nThe Guadalajara Macrobus is a public transportation system based on the concept of Bus Rapid Transit, where each bus has a single route and boarding station. Phase I of the Macrob\u00fas project opened in 2009 with a 16-kilometre-long (9.9 mi) corridor following Calzada Independencia and serving 27 stations. The Guadalajara trolleybus system has been operating since the 1970s,, along with many city buses run by private companies and a bustling network of pedestrianised streets.\nMi Bici P\u00fablica, PBSC Urban Solutions-based public bike share system, was launched in 2014. In 2016, the city implemented 242 docking stations and 2116 bikes. As of September 2018 Mi Bici has 19,664 annually subscribed users.In Guadalajara, a person spends an average of 82 minutes per weekday commuting with public transportation. 23% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day.

        "wiki": "Florence ( FLORR-\u0259nss; Italian: Firenze [fi\u02c8r\u025bntse] (listen)) is a city in central Italy and the capital city of the Tuscany region. It is the most populated city in Tuscany, with 383,084 inhabitants in 2013, and over 1,520,000 in its metropolitan area.Florence was a centre of medieval European trade and finance and one of the wealthiest cities of that era. It is considered by many academics to have been the birthplace of the Renaissance, and has been called \"the Athens of the Middle Ages\". Its turbulent political history includes periods of rule by the powerful Medici family and numerous religious and republican revolutions. From 1865 to 1871 the city served as the capital of the Kingdom of Italy (established in 1861). The Florentine dialect forms the base of Standard Italian and it became the language of culture throughout Italy due to the prestige of the masterpieces by Dante Alighieri, Petrarch, Giovanni Boccaccio, Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli and Francesco Guicciardini.\nThe city attracts millions of tourists each year, and UNESCO declared the Historic Centre of Florence a World Heritage Site in 1982. The city is noted for its culture, Renaissance art and architecture and monuments. The city also contains numerous museums and art galleries, such as the Uffizi Gallery and the Palazzo Pitti, and still exerts an influence in the fields of art, culture and politics. Due to Florence's artistic and architectural heritage, Forbes has ranked it as one of the most beautiful cities in the world.Florence plays an important role in Italian fashion, and is ranked in the top 15 fashion capitals of the world by Global Language Monitor; furthermore, it is a major national economic centre, as well as a tourist and industrial hub. In 2008 the city had the 17th-highest average income in Italy.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nFlorence originated as a Roman city, and later, after a long period as a flourishing trading and banking medieval commune, it was the birthplace of the Italian Renaissance. It was politically, economically, and culturally one of the most important cities in Europe and the world from the 14th to 16th centuries.The language spoken in the city during the 14th century came to be accepted as the model for what would become the Italian language. Thanks especially to the works of the Tuscans Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio, Florentine dialect, above all the local dialects, was adopted as the basis for a national literary language.Starting from the late Middle Ages, Florentine money\u2014in the form of the gold florin\u2014financed the development of industry all over Europe, from Britain to Bruges, to Lyon and Hungary. Florentine bankers financed the English kings during the Hundred Years War. They similarly financed the papacy, including the construction of their provisional capital of Avignon and, after their return to Rome, the reconstruction and Renaissance embellishment of Rome.\nFlorence was home to the Medici, one of European history's most important noble families. Lorenzo de' Medici was considered a political and cultural mastermind of Italy in the late 15th century. Two members of the family were popes in the early 16th century: Leo X and Clement VII. Catherine de Medici married King Henry II of France and, after his death in 1559, reigned as regent in France. Marie de' Medici married Henry IV of France and gave birth to the future King Louis XIII. The Medici reigned as Grand Dukes of Tuscany, starting with Cosimo I de' Medici in 1569 and ending with the death of Gian Gastone de' Medici in 1737.\n\n\n=== Roman origins ===\n\nThe Etruscans initially formed in the 9th\u20138th century BC  the small settlement of Fiesole (Faesulae in Latin), which was destroyed by Lucius Cornelius Sulla in 80 BC in reprisal for supporting the populares faction in Rome. The present city of Florence was established by Julius Caesar in 59 BC as a settlement for his veteran soldiers and was named originally Fluentia, owing to the fact that it was built between two rivers, which was later changed to Florentia (\"flowering\"). It was built in the style of an army camp with the main streets, the cardo and the decumanus, intersecting at the present Piazza della Repubblica. Situated along the Via Cassia, the main route between Rome and the north, and within the fertile valley of the Arno, the settlement quickly became an important commercial centre.\nIn centuries to come, the city experienced turbulent periods of Ostrogothic rule, during which the city was often troubled by warfare between the Ostrogoths and the Byzantines, which may have caused the population to fall to as few as 1,000 people. Peace returned under Lombard rule in the 6th century. Florence was conquered by Charlemagne in 774 and became part of the Duchy of Tuscany, with Lucca as capital. The population began to grow again and commerce prospered. In 854, Florence and Fiesole were united in one county.\n\n\n=== Second millennium ===\n\nMargrave Hugo chose Florence as his residency instead of Lucca at about 1000 AD. The Golden Age of Florentine art began around this time. In 1013, construction began on the Basilica di San Miniato al Monte. The exterior of the church was reworked in Romanesque style between 1059 and 1128. In 1100, Florence was a \"Commune\", meaning a city state. The city's primary resource was the Arno river, providing power and access for the industry (mainly textile industry), and access to the Mediterranean sea for international trade. Another great source of strength was its industrious merchant community. The Florentine merchant banking skills became recognised in Europe after they brought decisive financial innovation (e.g. bills of exchange, double-entry bookkeeping system) to medieval fairs. This period also saw the eclipse of Florence's formerly powerful rival Pisa (defeated by Genoa in 1284 and subjugated by Florence in 1406), and the exercise of power by the mercantile elite following an anti-aristocratic movement, led by Giano della Bella, that resulted in a set of laws called the Ordinances of Justice (1293).\n\n\n=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===\n\n\n==== Rise of the Medici ====\n\nAt the height of demographic expansion around 1325, the urban population may have been as great as 120,000, and the rural population around the city was probably close to 300,000. The Black Death of 1348 reduced it by over half, about 25,000 are said to have been supported by the city's wool industry: in 1345 Florence was the scene of an attempted strike by wool combers (ciompi), who in 1378 rose up in a brief revolt against oligarchic rule in the Revolt of the Ciompi. After their suppression, Florence came under the sway (1382\u20131434) of the Albizzi family, who became bitter rivals of the Medici.\nIn the 15th century, Florence was among the largest cities in Europe with a population of 60,000 and was considered rich and economically successful. Cosimo de' Medici was the first Medici family member to essentially control the city from behind the scenes. Although the city was technically a democracy of sorts, his power came from a vast patronage network along with his alliance to the new immigrants, the gente nuova (new people). The fact that the Medici were bankers to the pope also contributed to their ascendancy. Cosimo was succeeded by his son Piero, who was, soon after, succeeded by Cosimo's grandson, Lorenzo in 1469. Lorenzo was a great patron of the arts, commissioning works by Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and Botticelli. Lorenzo was an accomplished poet and musician and brought composers and singers to Florence, including Alexander Agricola, Johannes Ghiselin, and Heinrich Isaac. By contemporary Florentines (and since), he was known as \"Lorenzo the Magnificent\" (Lorenzo il Magnifico).\nFollowing Lorenzo de' Medici's death in 1492, he was succeeded by his son Piero II. When the French king Charles VIII invaded northern Italy, Piero II chose to resist his army. But when he realised the size of the French army at the gates of Pisa, he had to accept the humiliating conditions of the French king. These made the Florentines rebel, and they expelled Piero II. With his exile in 1494, the first period of Medici rule ended with the restoration of a republican government.\n\n\n==== Savonarola, Machiavelli, and the Medici Popes ====\n\nDuring this period, the Dominican friar Girolamo Savonarola had become prior of the San Marco monastery in 1490. He was famed for his penitential sermons, lambasting what he viewed as widespread immorality and attachment to material riches. He praised the exile of the Medici as the work of God, punishing them for their decadence. He seized the opportunity to carry through political reforms leading to a more democratic rule. But when Savonarola publicly accused Pope Alexander VI of corruption, he was banned from speaking in public. When he broke this ban, he was excommunicated. The Florentines, tired of his extreme teachings, turned against him and arrested him. He was convicted as a heretic and burned at the stake on the Piazza della Signoria on 23 May 1498.\nA second individual of unusually acute insight was Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, whose prescriptions for Florence's regeneration under strong leadership have often been seen as a legitimisation of political expediency and even malpractice. In other words, Machiavelli was a political thinker, perhaps most renowned for his political handbook, titled The Prince, which is about ruling and the exercise of power. Commissioned by the Medici, Machiavelli also wrote the Florentine Histories, the history of the city. Florentines drove out the Medici for a second time and re-established a republic on 16 May 1527. Restored twice with the support of both Emperor Charles V and Pope Clement VII (Giulio de Medici), the Medici in 1532 became hereditary dukes of Florence, and in 1569 Grand Dukes of Tuscany, ruling for two centuries. In all Tuscany, only the Republic of Lucca (later a Duchy) and the Principality of Piombino were independent from Florence.\n\n\n=== 18th and 19th centuries ===\n\nThe extinction of the Medici dynasty and the accession in 1737 of Francis Stephen, duke of Lorraine and husband of Maria Theresa of Austria, led to Tuscany's temporary inclusion in the territories of the Austrian crown. It became a secundogeniture of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty, who were deposed for the House of Bourbon-Parma in 1801. From 1801 to 1807 Florence was the capital of the Napoleonic client state Kingdom of Etruria. The Bourbon-Parma were deposed in December 1807 when Tuscany was annexed by France. Florence was the prefecture of the French d\u00e9partement of Arno from 1808 to the fall of Napoleon in 1814. The Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty was restored on the throne of Tuscany at the Congress of Vienna but finally deposed in 1859. Tuscany became a region of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861.\nFlorence replaced Turin as Italy's capital in 1865 and, in an effort to modernise the city, the old market in the Piazza del Mercato Vecchio and many medieval houses were pulled down and replaced by a more formal street plan with newer houses. The Piazza (first renamed Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II, then Piazza della Repubblica, the present name) was significantly widened and a large triumphal arch was constructed at the west end. This development was unpopular and was prevented from continuing by the efforts of several British and American people living in the city. A museum recording the destruction stands nearby today.\nThe country's second capital city was superseded by Rome six years later, after the withdrawal of the French troops allowed the capture of Rome.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nDuring World War II the city experienced a year-long German occupation (1943\u20131944) being part of the Italian Social Republic. Hitler declared it an open city on July 3, 1944 as troops of the British 8th Army closed in. In early August, the retreating Germans decided to demolish all the bridges along the Arno linking the district of Oltrarno to the rest of the city, making it difficult for troops of the 8th Army to cross. However, at the last moment Charles Steinhauslin, at the time consul of 26 countries in Florence, convinced the German general in Italy that the Ponte Vecchio was not to be destroyed due to its historical value. Instead, an equally historic area of streets directly to the south of the bridge, including part of the Corridoio Vasariano, was destroyed using mines. Since then the bridges have been restored to their original forms using as many of the remaining materials as possible, but the buildings surrounding the Ponte Vecchio have been rebuilt in a style combining the old with modern design. Shortly before leaving Florence, as they knew that they would soon have to retreat, the Germans executed many freedom fighters and political opponents publicly, in streets and squares including the Piazza Santo Spirito.Florence was liberated by New Zealand, South African and British troops on 4 August 1944 alongside partisans from the Tuscan Committee of National Liberation (CTLN). The Allied soldiers who died driving the Germans from Tuscany are buried in cemeteries outside the city (Americans about nine kilometres (5.6 miles) south of the city, British and Commonwealth soldiers a few kilometres east of the centre on the right bank of the Arno).\nAt the end of World War II in May 1945, the US Army's Information and Educational Branch was ordered to establish an overseas university campus for demobilised American service men and women in Florence, Italy. The first American University for service personnel was established in June 1945 at the School of Aeronautics in Florence, Italy. Some 7,500 soldier-students were to pass through the University during its four one-month sessions (see G. I. American Universities).In November 1966, the Arno flooded parts of the centre, damaging many art treasures. Around the city there are tiny placards on the walls noting where the flood waters reached at their highest point.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nFlorence lies in a basin formed by the hills of Careggi, Fiesole, Settignano, Arcetri, Poggio Imperiale and Bellosguardo (Florence). The Arno river, three other minor rivers (Mugnone, Ema and Greve) and some streams flow through it.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nFlorence has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), tending to Mediterranean (Csa). It has hot summers with moderate or light rainfall and cool, damp winters. As Florence lacks a prevailing wind, summer temperatures are higher than along the coast. Rainfall in summer is convectional, while relief rainfall dominates in the winter. Snow flurries happen almost every year, but often result in no accumulation. The highest officially recorded temperature was 42.6 \u00b0C (108.7 \u00b0F) on 26 July 1983 and the lowest was \u221223.2 \u00b0C (\u22129.8 \u00b0F) on 12 January 1985.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\t\t\n\nThe legislative body of the municipality is the City Council (Consiglio Comunale), which is composed of 36 councillors elected every five years with a proportional system, contextually to the mayoral elections. The executive body is the City Committee (Giunta Comunale), composed by 7 assessors, that is nominated and presieded over by a directly elected Mayor. The current mayor of Florence is Dario Nardella.\nThe municipality of Florence is subdivided into five administrative Boroughs (Quartieri). Each Borough is governed by a Council (Consiglio) and a President, elected contextually to the city Mayor. The urban organisation is governed by the Italian Constitution (art. 114). The Boroughs have the power to advise the Mayor with nonbinding opinions on a large spectrum of topics (environment, construction, public health, local markets) and exercise the functions delegated to them by the City Council; in addition they are supplied with an autonomous founding in order to finance local activities. The Boroughs are:\n\nQ1 \u2013 Centro storico (Historic Centre); population: 67,170;\nQ2 \u2013 Campo di Marte; population: 88,588;\nQ3 \u2013 Gavinana-Galluzzo; population: 40,907;\nQ4 \u2013 Isolotto-Legnaia; population: 66,636;\nQ5 \u2013 Rifredi; population: 103,761.All of the five boroughs are governed by the Democratic Party.\nThe former Italian Prime Minister (2014\u20132016), Matteo Renzi, served as mayor from 2009 to 2014.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nFlorence is known as the \"cradle of the Renaissance\" (la culla del Rinascimento) for its monuments, churches, and buildings. The best-known site of Florence is the domed cathedral of the city, Santa Maria del Fiore, known as The Duomo, whose dome was built by Filippo Brunelleschi. The nearby Campanile (partly designed by Giotto) and the Baptistery buildings are also highlights. The dome, 600 years after its completion, is still the largest dome built in brick and mortar in the world. In 1982, the historic centre of Florence (Italian: centro storico di Firenze) was declared a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO. The centre of the city is contained in medieval walls that were built in the 14th century to defend the city. At the heart of the city, in Piazza della Signoria, is Bartolomeo Ammannati's Fountain of Neptune (1563\u20131565), which is a masterpiece of marble sculpture at the terminus of a still functioning Roman aqueduct.\nThe layout and structure of Florence in many ways harkens back to the Roman era, where it was designed as a garrison settlement. Nevertheless, the majority of the city was built during the Renaissance. Despite the strong presence of Renaissance architecture within the city, traces of medieval, Baroque, Neoclassical and modern architecture can be found. The Palazzo Vecchio as well as the Duomo, or the city's Cathedral, are the two buildings which dominate Florence's skyline.The river Arno, which cuts through the old part of the city, is as much a character in Florentine history as many of the people who lived there. Historically, the locals have had a love-hate relationship with the Arno \u2013 which alternated between nourishing the city with commerce, and destroying it by flood.\n\nOne of the bridges in particular stands out \u2014 the Ponte Vecchio (Old Bridge), whose most striking feature is the multitude of shops built upon its edges, held up by stilts. The bridge also carries Vasari's elevated corridor linking the Uffizi to the Medici residence (Palazzo Pitti). Although the original bridge was constructed by the Etruscans, the current bridge was rebuilt in the 14th century. It is the only bridge in the city to have survived World War II intact. It is the first example in the western world of a bridge built using segmental arches, that is, arches less than a semicircle, to reduce both span-to-rise ratio and the numbers of pillars to allow lesser encumbrance in the riverbed (being in this much more successful than the Roman Alcon\u00e9tar Bridge).\n\nThe church of San Lorenzo contains the Medici Chapel, the mausoleum of the Medici family\u2014the most powerful family in Florence from the 15th to the 18th century. Nearby is the Uffizi Gallery, one of the finest art museums in the world \u2013 founded on a large bequest from the last member of the Medici family.\n\nThe Uffizi is located at the corner of Piazza della Signoria, a site important for being the centre of Florence's civil life and government for centuries. The Palazzo della Signoria facing it is still home of the municipal government. Many significant episodes in the history of art and political changes were staged here, such as:\n\nIn 1301, Dante Alighieri was sent into exile from here (commemorated by a plaque on one of the walls of the Uffizi).\nOn 26 April 1478, Jacopo de' Pazzi and his retainers tried to raise the city against the Medici after the plot known as La congiura dei Pazzi (The Pazzi conspiracy), murdering Giuliano di Piero de' Medici and wounding his brother Lorenzo. All the members of the plot who could be apprehended were seized by the Florentines and hanged from the windows of the palace.\nIn 1497, it was the location of the Bonfire of the Vanities instigated by the Dominican friar and preacher Girolamo Savonarola\nOn 23 May 1498, the same Savonarola and two followers were hanged and burnt at the stake. (A round plate in the ground marks the spot where he was hanged)\nIn 1504, Michelangelo's David (now replaced by a replica, since the original was moved in 1873 to the Galleria dell'Accademia) was installed in front of the Palazzo della Signoria (also known as Palazzo Vecchio).The Loggia dei Lanzi in Piazza della Signoria is the location of a number of statues by other sculptors such as Donatello, Giambologna, Ammannati and Cellini, although some have been replaced with copies to preserve the originals.\n\n\n=== Monuments, museums and religious buildings ===\n\nFlorence contains several palaces and buildings from various eras. The Palazzo Vecchio is the town hall of Florence and also an art museum. This large Romanesque crenellated fortress-palace overlooks the Piazza della Signoria with its copy of Michelangelo's David statue as well as the gallery of statues in the adjacent Loggia dei Lanzi. Originally called the Palazzo della Signoria, after the Signoria of Florence, the ruling body of the Republic of Florence, it was also given several other names: Palazzo del Popolo, Palazzo dei Priori, and Palazzo Ducale, in accordance with the varying use of the palace during its long history. The building acquired its current name when the Medici duke's residence was moved across the Arno to the Palazzo Pitti. It is linked to the Uffizi and the Palazzo Pitti through the Corridoio Vasariano.\nPalazzo Medici Riccardi, designed by Michelozzo di Bartolomeo for Cosimo il Vecchio, of the Medici family, is another major edifice, and was built between 1445 and 1460. It was well known for its stone masonry that includes rustication and ashlar. Today it is the head office of the Metropolitan City of Florence and hosts museums and the Riccardiana Library. The Palazzo Strozzi, an example of civil architecture with its rusticated stone, was inspired by the Palazzo Medici, but with more harmonious proportions. Today the palace is used for international expositions like the annual antique show (founded as the Biennale dell'Antiquariato in 1959), fashion shows and other cultural and artistic events. Here also is the seat of the Istituto Nazionale del Rinascimento and the noted Gabinetto Vieusseux, with the library and reading room.\nThere are several other notable places, including the Palazzo Rucellai, designed by Leon Battista Alberti between 1446 and 1451 and executed, at least in part, by Bernardo Rossellino; the Palazzo Davanzati, which houses the museum of the Old Florentine House; the Palazzo delle Assicurazioni Generali, designed in the Neo-Renaissance style in 1871; the Palazzo Spini Feroni, in Piazza Santa Trinita, a historic 13th-century private palace, owned since the 1920s by shoe-designer Salvatore Ferragamo; as well as various others, including the Palazzo Borghese, the Palazzo di Bianca Cappello, the Palazzo Antinori, and the Royal building of Santa Maria Novella.\n\nFlorence contains numerous museums and art galleries where some of the world's most important works of art are held. The city is one of the best preserved Renaissance centres of art and architecture in the world and has a high concentration of art, architecture and culture. In the ranking list of the 15 most visited Italian art museums, \u2154 are represented by Florentine museums. The Uffizi is one of these, having a very large collection of international and Florentine art. The gallery is articulated in many halls, catalogued by schools and chronological order. Engendered by the Medici family's artistic collections through the centuries, it houses works of art by various painters and artists. The Vasari Corridor is another gallery, built connecting the Palazzo Vecchio with the Pitti Palace passing by the Uffizi and over the Ponte Vecchio. The Galleria dell'Accademia houses a Michelangelo collection, including the David. It has a collection of Russian icons and works by various artists and painters. Other museums and galleries include the Bargello, which concentrates on sculpture works by artists including Donatello, Giambologna and Michelangelo; the Palazzo Pitti, containing part of the Medici family's former private collection. In addition to the Medici collection, the palace's galleries contain many Renaissance works, including several by Raphael and Titian, large collections of costumes, ceremonial carriages, silver, porcelain and a gallery of modern art dating from the 18th century. Adjoining the palace are the Boboli Gardens, elaborately landscaped and with numerous sculptures.\n\nThere are several different churches and religious buildings in Florence. The cathedral is Santa Maria del Fiore. The San Giovanni Baptistery located in front of the cathedral, is decorated by numerous artists, notably by Lorenzo Ghiberti with the Gates of Paradise. Other churches in Florence include the Basilica of Santa Maria Novella, located in Santa Maria Novella square (near the Firenze Santa Maria Novella railway station) which contains works by Masaccio, Paolo Uccello, Filippino Lippi and Domenico Ghirlandaio; the Basilica of Santa Croce, the principal Franciscan church in the city, which is situated on the Piazza di Santa Croce, about 800 metres (2,600 feet) south east of the Duomo, and is the burial place of some of the most illustrious Italians, such as Michelangelo, Galileo, Machiavelli, Foscolo, Rossini, thus it is known also as the Temple of the Italian Glories (Tempio dell'Itale Glorie); the Basilica of San Lorenzo, which is one of the largest churches in the city, situated at the centre of Florence's main market district, and the burial place of all the principal members of the Medici family from Cosimo il Vecchio to Cosimo III; Santo Spirito, in the Oltrarno quarter, facing the square with the same name; Orsanmichele, whose building was constructed on the site of the kitchen garden of the monastery of San Michele, now demolished; Santissima Annunziata, a Roman Catholic basilica and the mother church of the Servite order; Ognissanti, which was founded by the lay order of the Umiliati, and is among the first examples of Baroque architecture built in the city; the Santa Maria del Carmine, in the Oltrarno district of Florence, which is the location of the Brancacci Chapel, housing outstanding Renaissance frescoes by Masaccio and Masolino da Panicale, later finished by Filippino Lippi; the Medici Chapel with statues by Michelangelo, in the San Lorenzo; as well as several others, including Santa Trinita, San Marco, Santa Felicita, Badia Fiorentina, San Gaetano, San Miniato al Monte, Florence Charterhouse, and Santa Maria del Carmine. The city additionally contains the Orthodox Russian church of Nativity, and the Great Synagogue of Florence, built in the 19th century.\nFlorence contains various theatres and cinemas. The Odeon Cinema of the Palazzo dello Strozzino is one of the oldest cinemas in the city. Established from 1920 to 1922 in a wing of the Palazzo dello Strozzino, it used to be called the Cinema Teatro Savoia (Savoy Cinema-Theatre), yet was later called Odeon. The Teatro della Pergola, located in the centre of the city on the eponymous street, is an opera house built in the 17th century. Another theatre is the Teatro Comunale (or Teatro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino), originally built as the open-air amphitheatre, the Politeama Fiorentino Vittorio Emanuele, which was inaugurated on 17 May 1862 with a production of Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor and which seated 6,000 people. There are several other theatres, such as the Saloncino Castinelli, the Teatro Puccini, the Teatro Verdi, the Teatro Goldoni and the Teatro Niccolini.\n\n\n=== Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore ===\nFlorence Cathedral, formally the Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore, is the cathedral of Florence, Italy. It was begun in 1296 in the Gothic style to a design of Arnolfo di Cambio and was structurally completed by 1436, with the dome designed by Filippo Brunelleschi.\n\n\n=== Squares, streets and parks ===\n\nAside from such monuments, Florence contains numerous major squares (piazze) and streets. The Piazza della Repubblica is a square in the city centre, location of the cultural caf\u00e9s and bourgeois palaces. Among the square's caf\u00e9s (like Caff\u00e8 Gilli, Paszkowski or the Hard Rock Caf\u00e8), the Giubbe Rosse caf\u00e9 has long been a meeting place for artists and writers, notably those of Futurism. The Piazza Santa Croce is another; dominated by the Basilica of Santa Croce, it is a rectangular square in the centre of the city where the Calcio Fiorentino is played every year. Furthermore, there is the Piazza Santa Trinita, a square near the Arno that mark the end of the Via de' Tornabuoni street.\n\nOther squares include the Piazza San Marco, the Piazza Santa Maria Novella, the Piazza Beccaria and the Piazza della Libert\u00e0. The centre additionally contains several streets. Such include the Via Camillo Cavour, one of the main roads of the northern area of the historic centre; the Via Ghibellina, one of central Florence's longest streets; the Via dei Calzaiuoli, one of the most central streets of the historic centre  which links Piazza del Duomo to Piazza della Signoria, winding parallel to via Roma and Piazza della Repubblica; the Via de' Tornabuoni, a luxurious street in the city centre that goes from Antinori square to ponte Santa Trinita, across Piazza Santa Trinita, characterised by the presence of fashion boutiques; the Viali di Circonvallazione, 6-lane boulevards surrounding the northern part of the historic centre; as well as others, such as Via Roma, Via degli Speziali, Via de' Cerretani, and the Viale dei Colli.\nFlorence also contains various parks and gardens. Such include the Boboli Gardens, the Parco delle Cascine, the Giardino Bardini and the Giardino dei Semplici, amongst others.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn 1200 the city was home to 50,000 people. By 1300 the population of the city proper was 120,000, with an additional 300,000 living in the Contado. Between 1500 and 1650 the population was around 70,000.As of 31 October 2010, the population of the city proper is 370,702, while Eurostat estimates that 696,767 people live in the urban area of Florence. The Metropolitan Area of Florence, Prato and Pistoia, constituted in 2000 over an area of roughly 4,800 square kilometres (1,853 sq mi), is home to 1.5 million people. Within Florence proper, 46.8% of the population was male in 2007 and 53.2% were female. Minors (children aged 18 and less) totalled 14.10 percent of the population compared to pensioners, who numbered 25.95 percent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners). The average age of Florence resident is 49 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Florence grew by 3.22 percent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.56 percent. The birth rate of Florence is 7.66 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.\nAs of 2009, 87.46% of the population was Italian. An estimated 6,000 Chinese live in the city. The largest immigrant group came from other European countries (mostly Romanians and Albanians): 3.52%, East Asia (mostly Chinese and Filipino): 2.17%, the Americas: 1.41%, and North Africa (mostly Moroccan): 0.9%.Much like the rest of Italy most of the people in Florence are Roman Catholic, with more than 90% of the population belonging to the Archdiocese of Florence.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nTourism is, by far, the most important of all industries and most of the Florentine economy relies on the money generated by international arrivals and students studying in the city. The value tourism to the city totalled some \u20ac2.5 billion in 2015 and the number of visitors had increased by 5.5% from the previous year.In 2013, Florence was listed as the second best world city by Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler.Manufacturing and commerce, however, still remain highly important. Florence is also Italy's 17th richest city in terms of average workers' earnings, with the figure being \u20ac23,265 (the overall city's income is \u20ac6,531,204,473), coming after Mantua, yet surpassing Bolzano.\n\n\n=== Industry, commerce and services ===\nFlorence is a major production and commercial centre in Italy, where the Florentine industrial complexes in the suburbs produce all sorts of goods, from furniture, rubber goods, chemicals, and food. However, traditional and local products, such as antiques, handicrafts, glassware, leatherwork, art reproductions, jewellery, souvenirs, elaborate metal and iron-work, shoes, accessories and high fashion clothes also dominate a fair sector of Florence's economy. The city's income relies partially on services and commercial and cultural interests, such as annual fairs, theatrical and lyrical productions, art exhibitions, festivals and fashion shows, such as the Calcio Fiorentino. Heavy industry and machinery also take their part in providing an income. In Nuovo Pignone, numerous factories are still present, and small-to medium industrial businesses are dominant. The Florence-Prato-Pistoia industrial districts and areas were known as the 'Third Italy' in the 1990s, due to the exports of high-quality goods and automobile (especially the Vespa) and the prosperity and productivity of the Florentine entrepreneurs. Some of these industries even rivalled the traditional industrial districts in Emilia-Romagna and Veneto due to high profits and productivity.In the fourth quarter of 2015, manufacturing increased by 2.4% and exports increased by 7.2%. Leading sectors included mechanical engineering, fashion, pharmaceutics, food and wine. During 2015, permanent employment contracts increased by 48.8 percent, boosted by nationwide tax break.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism is the most significant industry in central Florence. From April to October, tourists outnumber local population. Tickets to the Uffizi and Accademia museums are regularly sold out and large groups regularly fill the basilicas of Santa Croce and Santa Maria Novella, both of which charge for entry. Tickets for The Uffizi and Accademia can be purchased online prior to visiting. In 2010, readers of Travel + Leisure magazine ranked the city as their third favourite tourist destination. In 2015, Cond\u00e9 Nast Travel readers voted Florence as the best city in Europe.Studies by Euromonitor International have concluded that cultural and history-oriented tourism is generating significantly increased spending throughout Europe.Florence is believed to have the greatest concentration of art (in proportion to its size) in the world. Thus, cultural tourism is particularly strong, with world-renowned museums such as the Uffizi selling over 1.93 million tickets in 2014. The city's convention centre facilities were restructured during the 1990s and host exhibitions, conferences, meetings, social forums, concerts and other events all year.\n\nIn 2016, Florence had 20,588 hotel rooms in 570 facilities. International visitors use 75% of the rooms; some 18% of those were from the U.S. In 2014, the city had 8.5 million overnight stays. A Euromonitor report indicates that in 2015 the city ranked as the world's 36th most visited in the world, with over 4.95 million arrivals for the year.Tourism brings revenue to Florence, but it creates certain problems. The Ponte Vecchio, The San Lorenzo Market and Santa Maria Novella are plagued by pickpockets. The province of Florence receives roughly 13 million visitors per year and in peak seasons, that can lead to over crowding at popular locations. Mayor Dario Nardella is particularly concerned about visitors who arrive on buses, stay only a few hours, spend little money but contribute significantly to overcrowding. \"No museum visit, just a photo from the square, the bus back and then on to Venice... We don\u2019t want tourists like that,\" he said.Some tourists are less than respectful of the city's cultural heritage, according to Nardella. In June 2017, he instituted a programme of spraying church steps with water to prevent tourists from using such areas as picnic spots. While he values the benefits of tourism, there has been \"an increase among those who  sit down on church steps, eat their food and leave rubbish strewn on them,\" he explained. To boost the sale of traditional foods, the mayor had introduced legislation (enacted in 2016) that requires restaurants to use typical Tuscan products and rejected McDonald's application to open a location in the  Piazza del Duomo.\n\n\n=== Food and wine production ===\n\nFood and wine have long been an important staple of the economy. The Chianti region is just south of the city, and its Sangiovese grapes figure prominently not only in its Chianti Classico wines but also in many of the more recently developed Supertuscan blends. Within 32 km (20 mi) to the west is the Carmignano area, also home to flavourful sangiovese-based reds. The celebrated Chianti Rufina district, geographically and historically separated from the main Chianti region, is also few kilometres east of Florence. More recently, the Bolgheri region (about 150 km (93 mi) southwest of Florence) has become celebrated for its \"Super Tuscan\" reds such as Sassicaia and Ornellaia.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nFlorence was the birthplace of High Renaissance art, which lasted from 1450\u20131527. While Medieval art focused on basic story telling of the Bible, Renaissance art focused on naturalism and human emotion. Medieval art was abstract, formulaic, and largely produced by monks whereas Renaissance art was rational, mathematical, individualistic, consisted of linear perspective and shading (Chiaroscuro) and produced by specialists (Leonardo da Vinci, Donatello, Michelangelo, and Raphael). Religion was important, but with this new age came the humanization of religious figures in art, such as Expulsion from the Garden of Eden, Ecce Homo (Bosch, 1470s), and Madonna Della Seggiola; People of this age began to understand themselves as human beings, which reflected in art. The Renaissance marked the rebirth of classical values in art and society as people studied the ancient masters of the Greco-Roman world; Art became focused on realism as opposed to idealism.\n\nCimabue and Giotto, the fathers of Italian painting, lived in Florence as well as Arnolfo and Andrea Pisano, renewers of architecture and sculpture; Brunelleschi, Donatello and Masaccio, forefathers of the Renaissance, Ghiberti and the Della Robbias, Filippo Lippi and Angelico; Botticelli, Paolo Uccello and the universal genius of Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo.Their works, together with those of many other generations of artists, are gathered in the several museums of the town: the Uffizi Gallery, the Palatina gallery with the paintings of the \"Golden Ages\", the Bargello with the sculptures of the Renaissance, the museum of San Marco with Fra Angelico's works, the Academy, the chapels of the Medicis Buonarroti's house with the sculptures of Michelangelo, the following museums: Bardini, Horne, Stibbert, Romano, Corsini, The Gallery of Modern Art, the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, the museum of Silverware and the museum of Precious Stones.\nSeveral monuments are located in Florence: the Florence Baptistery with its mosaics; the Cathedral with its sculptures, the medieval churches with bands of frescoes; public as well as private palaces: Palazzo Vecchio, Palazzo Pitti, Palazzo Medici Riccardi, Palazzo Davanzati; monasteries, cloisters, refectories; the \"Certosa\". In the archaeological museum includes documents of Etruscan civilisation. In fact the city is so rich in art that some first time visitors experience the Stendhal syndrome as they encounter its art for the first time.\n\nFlorentine architects such as Filippo Brunelleschi (1377\u20131466) and Leon Battista Alberti (1404\u20131472) were among the fathers of both Renaissance and Neoclassical architecture.The cathedral, topped by Brunelleschi's dome, dominates the Florentine skyline. The Florentines decided to start building it \u2013 late in the 13th century, without a design for the dome. The project proposed by Brunelleschi in the 14th century was the largest ever built at the time, and the first major dome built in Europe since the two great domes of Roman times \u2013 the Pantheon in Rome, and Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. The dome of Santa Maria del Fiore remains the largest brick construction of its kind in the world. In front of it is the medieval Baptistery. The two buildings incorporate in their decoration the transition from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance. In recent years, most of the important works of art from the two buildings \u2013 and from the nearby Giotto's Campanile, have been removed and replaced by copies. The originals are now housed in the Museum dell'Opera del Duomo, just to the east of the Cathedral.\nFlorence has large numbers of art-filled churches, such as San Miniato al Monte, San Lorenzo, Santa Maria Novella, Santa Trinita, Santa Maria del Carmine, Santa Croce, Santo Spirito, the Annunziata, Ognissanti and numerous others.\n\nArtists associated with Florence range from Arnolfo di Cambio and Cimabue to Giotto, Nanni di Banco, and Paolo Uccello; through Lorenzo Ghiberti, and Donatello and Massaccio and the della Robbia family; through Fra Angelico and Botticelli and Piero della Francesca, and on to Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. Others include Benvenuto Cellini, Andrea del Sarto, Benozzo Gozzoli, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Filippo Lippi, Bernardo Buontalenti, Orcagna, Pollaiuolo, Filippino Lippi, Verrocchio, Bronzino, Desiderio da Settignano, Michelozzo, the Rossellis, the Sangallos, and Pontormo. Artists from other regions who worked in Florence include Raphael, Andrea Pisano, Giambologna, Il Sodoma and Peter Paul Rubens.\n\nPicture galleries in Florence include the Uffizi and the Pitti Palace. Two superb collections of sculpture are in the Bargello and the Museum of the Works of the Duomo. They are filled with the creations of Donatello, Verrochio, Desiderio da Settignano, Michelangelo and others. The Galleria dell'Accademia has Michelangelo's David \u2013 perhaps the best-known work of art anywhere, plus the unfinished statues of the slaves Michelangelo created for the tomb of Pope Julius II. Other sights include the medieval city hall, the Palazzo della Signoria (also known as the Palazzo Vecchio), the Archeological Museum, the Museum of the History of Science, the Garden of Archimedes, the Palazzo Davanzatti, the Stibbert Museum, St. Marks, the Medici Chapels, the Museum of the Works of Santa Croce, the Museum of the Cloister of Santa Maria Novella, the Zoological Museum (\"La Specola\"), the Bardini, and the Museo Horne. There is also a collection of works by the modern sculptor, Marino Marini, in a museum named after him. The Strozzi Palace is the site of special exhibits.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nFlorentine (fiorentino), spoken by inhabitants of Florence and its environs, is a Tuscan dialect and the immediate parent language to modern Italian.\nAlthough its vocabulary and pronunciation are largely identical to standard Italian, differences do exist. The Vocabolario del fiorentino contemporaneo (Dictionary of Modern Florentine) reveals lexical distinctions from all walks of life. Florentines have a highly recognisable accent in phonetic terms due to the so-called gorgia toscana): \"hard c\" /k/ between two vowels is pronounced as a fricative [h] similar to an English h, so that dico 'I say' is phonetically [\u02c8di\u02d0ho], i cani 'the dogs' is [i\u02c8ha\u02d0ni]. Similarly, t between vowels is pronounced [\u03b8] as in English thin, and p in the same position is the bilabial fricative [\u0278]. Other traits include using a form of the subjunctive mood last commonly used in medieval times, a frequent usage in everyday speech of the modern subjunctive, and a shortened pronunciation of the definite article, [i] instead of \"il\", causing doubling of the consonant that follows, so that il cane 'the dog', for example, is pronounced [ik\u02c8ka\u02d0ne].\nDante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio pioneered the use of the vernacular instead of the Latin used for most literary works at the time.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nDespite Latin being the main language of the courts and the Church in the Middle Ages, writers such as Dante Alighieri and many others used their own language, the Florentine vernacular descended from Latin, in composing their greatest works. The oldest literary pieces written in Florentine go as far back as the 13th century. Florence's literature fully blossomed in the 14th century, when not only Dante with his Divine Comedy (1306\u20131321) and Petrarch, but also poets such as Guido Cavalcanti and Lapo Gianni composed their most important works. Dante's masterpiece is the Divine Comedy, which mainly deals with the poet himself taking an allegoric and moral tour of Hell, Purgatory and finally Heaven, during which he meets numerous mythological or real characters of his age or before. He is first guided by the Roman poet Virgil, whose non-Christian beliefs damned him to Hell. Later on he is joined by Beatrice, who guides him through Heaven.In the 14th century, Petrarch and Giovanni Boccaccio led the literary scene in Florence after Dante's death in 1321. Petrarch was an all-rounder writer, author and poet, but was particularly known for his Canzoniere, or the Book of Songs, where he conveyed his unremitting love for Laura. His style of writing has since become known as Petrarchism. Boccaccio was better known for his Decameron, a slightly grim story of Florence during the 1350s bubonic plague, known as the Black Death, when some people fled the ravaged city to an isolated country mansion, and spent their time there recounting stories and novellas taken from the medieval and contemporary tradition. All of this is written in a series of 100 distinct novellas.In the 16th century, during the Renaissance, Florence was the home town of political writer and philosopher Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, whose ideas on how rulers should govern the land, detailed in The Prince, spread across European courts and enjoyed enduring popularity for centuries. These principles became known as Machiavellianism.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nFlorence became a musical centre during the Middle Ages and music and the performing arts remain an important part of its culture. The growth of Northern Italian Cities in the 1500s likely contributed to its increased prominence. During the Renaissance, there were four kinds of musical patronage in the city with respect to both sacred and secular music: state, corporate, church, and private. It was here that the Florentine Camerata convened in the mid-16th century and experimented with setting tales of Greek mythology to music and staging the result\u2014in other words, the first operas, setting the wheels in motion not just for the further development of the operatic form, but for later developments of separate \"classical\" forms such as the symphony and concerto.  After the year 1600, Italian trends prevailed across Europe, by 1750 it was the primary musical language. The genre of the Madrigal, born in Italy, gained popularity in Britain and elsewhere. Several Italian cities were \"larger on the musical map than their real-size for power suggested. Florence, was once such city which experienced a fantastic period in the early seventeenth Century of musico-theatrical innovation, including the beginning and flourishing of opera.Opera was invented in Florence in the late 16th century when Jacobo Peri's Dafne an opera in the style of monody, was premiered.  Opera spread from Florence throughout Italy and eventually Europe.  Vocal Music in the choir setting was also taking new identity at this time.  At the beginning of the 17th century, two practices for writing music were devised, one the first practice or Stile Antico/Prima Prattica the other the Stile Moderno/Seconda Prattica.  The Stile Antico was more prevalent in Northern Europe and Stile Moderno was practiced more by the Italian Composers of the time.Composers and musicians who have lived in Florence include Piero Strozzi (1550 \u2013 after 1608), Giulio Caccini (1551\u20131618) and Mike Francis (1961\u20132009). Giulio Caccini's book Le Nuove Musiche was significant in performance practice technique instruction at the time.  The book specified a new term, in use by the 1630s, called monody which indicated the combination of voice and basso continuo and connoted a practice of stating text in a free, lyrical, yet speech-like manner.  This would occur while an instrument, usually a keyboard type such as harpsichord, played and held chords while the singer sang/spoke the monodic line.\n\n\n=== Cinema ===\nFlorence has been a setting for numerous works of fiction and movies, including the novels and associated films, such as Light in the Piazza, The Girl Who Couldn't Say No, Calmi Cuori Appassionati, Hannibal, A Room with a View, Tea with Mussolini, Virgin Territory and Inferno. The city is home to renowned Italian actors and actresses, such as Roberto Benigni, Leonardo Pieraccioni and Vittoria Puccini.\n\n\n=== Video games ===\nFlorence has appeared as a location in video games such as Assassins Creed II. The Republic of Florence also appears as a playable nation in Paradox Interactive's grand strategy game Europa Universalis IV.\n\n\n=== Other Media ===\n16th century Florence is the setting of the Japanese manga and anime series Arte.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nFlorentine food grows out of a tradition of peasant eating rather than rarefied high cooking. The majority of dishes are based on meat. The whole animal was traditionally eaten; tripe (trippa) and stomach (lampredotto) were once regularly on the menu and still are sold at the food carts stationed throughout the city. Antipasti include crostini toscani, sliced bread rounds topped with a chicken liver-based p\u00e2t\u00e9, and sliced meats (mainly prosciutto and salame, often served with melon when in season). The typically saltless Tuscan bread, obtained with natural levain frequently features in Florentine courses, especially in its soups, ribollita and pappa al pomodoro, or in the salad of bread and fresh vegetables called panzanella that is served in summer. The bistecca alla fiorentina is a large (the customary size should weigh around 1.2 to 1.5 kg [40 to 50 oz]) \u2013 the \"date\" steak \u2013 T-bone steak of Chianina beef cooked over hot charcoal and served very rare with its more recently derived version, the tagliata, sliced rare beef served on a bed of arugula, often with slices of Parmesan cheese on top. Most of these courses are generally served with local olive oil, also a prime product enjoying a worldwide reputation. Among the desserts, schiacciata alla fiorentina, a white flatbread cake, is one of the most popular; it is a very soft cake, prepared with extremely simple ingredients, typical of Florentine cuisine, and is especially eaten at Carnival.\n\n\n=== Research activity ===\n\nResearch institutes and university departments are located within the Florence area and within two campuses at\nPolo di Novoli and Polo Scientifico di Sesto Fiorentino as well as in the Research Area of Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche.\n\n\n=== Science and discovery ===\n\nFlorence has been an important scientific centre for centuries, notably during the Renaissance with scientists such as Leonardo da Vinci.\nFlorentines were one of the driving forces behind the Age of Discovery. Florentine bankers financed Henry the Navigator and the Portuguese explorers who pioneered the route around Africa to India and the Far East. It was a map drawn by the Florentine Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli, a student of Brunelleschi, that Christopher Columbus used to sell his \"enterprise\" to the Spanish monarchs, and which he used on his first voyage. Mercator's \"Projection\" is a refined version of Toscanelli's \u2013 taking into account the Americas, of which the Florentine was, obviously, ignorant.\nGalileo and other scientists pioneered the study of optics, ballistics, astronomy, anatomy, and so on. Pico della Mirandola, Leonardo Bruni, Machiavelli, and many others laid the groundwork for our understanding of science.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\n\nBy the year 1300 Florence had become a centre of textile production in Europe. Many of the rich families in Renaissance Florence were major purchasers of locally produced fine clothing, and the specialists of fashion in the economy and culture of Florence during that period is often underestimated. Florence is regarded by some as the birthplace and earliest centre of the modern (post World War Two) fashion industry in Italy. The Florentine \"soir\u00e9es\" of the early 1950s organised by Giovanni Battista Giorgini were events where several Italian designers participated in group shows and first garnered international attention. Florence has served as the home of the Italian fashion company Salvatore Ferragamo since 1928. Gucci, Roberto Cavalli, and Emilio Pucci are also headquartered in Florence. Other major players in the fashion industry such as Prada and Chanel have large offices and stores in Florence or its outskirts. Florence's main upscale shopping street is Via de' Tornabuoni, where major luxury fashion houses and jewellery labels, such as Armani and Bulgari, have their elegant boutiques. Via del Parione and Via Roma are other streets that are also well known for their high-end fashion stores.\n\n\n=== Historical evocations ===\n\n\n==== Scoppio del Carro ====\nThe Scoppio del Carro (\"Explosion of the Cart\") is a celebration of the First Crusade. During the day of Easter, a cart, which the Florentines call the Brindellone and which is led by four white oxen, is taken to the Piazza del Duomo between the Baptistery of St. John the Baptist (Battistero di San Giovanni) and the Florence Cathedral (Santa Maria del Fiore). The cart is connected by a rope to the interior of the church. Near the cart there is a model of a dove, which, according to legend, is a symbol of good luck for the city: at the end of the Easter mass, the dove emerges from the nave of the Duomo and ignites the fireworks on the cart.\n\n\n==== Calcio Storico ====\n\nCalcio Storico Fiorentino (\"Historic Florentine Football\"), sometimes called Calcio in costume, is a traditional sport, regarded as a forerunner of soccer, though the actual gameplay most closely resembles rugby. The event originates from the Middle Ages, when the most important Florentine nobles amused themselves playing while wearing bright costumes. The most important match was played on 17 February 1530, during the siege of Florence. That day Papal troops besieged the city while the Florentines, with contempt of the enemies, decided to play the game notwithstanding the situation. The game is played in the Piazza di Santa Croce. A temporary arena is constructed, with bleachers and a sand-covered playing field. A series of matches are held between four teams representing each quartiere (quarter) of Florence during late June and early July. There are four teams: Azzurri (light blue), Bianchi (white), Rossi (red) and Verdi (green). The Azzurri are from the quarter of Santa Croce, Bianchi from the quarter of Santo Spirito, Verdi are from San Giovanni and Rossi from Santa Maria Novella.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nIn association football Florence is represented by ACF Fiorentina, which plays in Serie A, the top league of Italian league system.\nACF Fiorentina has won two Italian Championships, in 1956 and 1969, and 6 Italian cup,  since their formation in 1926. They play their games at the Stadio Artemio Franchi, which holds 47,282.\nThe female squad of ACF Fiorentina have won the women's association football Italian Championship of the 2016\u201317 season.\nThe city is home of the Centro Tecnico Federale di Coverciano, in Coverciano, Florence, the main training ground of the Italian national team, and the technical department of the Italian Football Federation.\nFlorence was selected to host the 2013 UCI World Road Cycling Championships.\nSince 2017 Florence is also represented in Eccellenza, the top tier of rugby union league system in Italy, by I Medicei, which is a club established in 2015 by the merging of the senior squads of I Cavalieri (of Prato) and Firenze Rugby 1931.\nI Medicei won the Serie A Championship in 2016\u201317 and were promoted to Eccellenza for the 2017\u201318 season.\nRari Nantes Florentia is a successful water polo club based in Florence; both its male and female squads have won several Italian championships and the female squad has also European titles in their palmar\u00e8s.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe University of Florence was first founded in 1321, and was recognized by Pope Clement VI in 1349. In 2019, over 50,000 students were enrolled at the university.\nSeveral American universities host a campus in Florence. Including New York University, Marist College, Pepperdine, Stanford, Florida State and James Madison. Over 8,000 American students are enrolled for study in Florence.The private school, Centro Machiavelli which teaches Italian language and culture to foreigners, is located in Piazza Santo Spirito in Florence.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Cars ===\nThe centre of Florence is closed to through-traffic, although buses, taxis and residents with appropriate permits are allowed in. This area is commonly referred to as the ZTL (Zona Traffico Limitato), which is divided into several subsections. Residents of one section, therefore, will only be able to drive in their district and perhaps some surrounding ones. Cars without permits are allowed to enter after 7.30 pm, or before 7.30 am. The rules shift during the tourist-filled summers, putting more restrictions on where one can get in and out.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\n\nThe principal public transit network in the city is run by the ATAF and Li-nea bus company. Individual tickets, or a pass called Carta Agile with multiple rides, should be purchased in advance and are available at local tobacconists, bars and newspaper stalls and must be validated once on board. These tickets may be used on ATAF and Li-nea buses, Tramvia and second-class local trains only within city railway stations. Train tickets must be validated before boarding. The main bus station is next to Santa Maria Novella railway station. Trenitalia runs trains between the railway stations within the city, and to other destinations around Italy and Europe. The central railway station, Santa Maria Novella, is about 500 m (1,600 ft) northwest of the Piazza del Duomo. There are two other important stations: Campo di Marte and Rifredi. Most bundled routes are Firenze\u2014Pisa, Firenze\u2014Viareggio and Firenze-Arezzo (along the main line to Rome). Other local railways connect Florence with Borgo San Lorenzo in the Mugello area (Faentina railway) and Siena.\nLong distance 10 km (6.21 mi) buses are run by the SITA, Copit, CAP companies. The transit companies also accommodate travellers from the Amerigo Vespucci Airport, which is 5 km (3.1 mi) west of the city centre, and which has scheduled services run by major European carriers.\n\n\n=== Trams ===\n\nIn an effort to reduce air pollution and car traffic in the city, a multi-line tram network called Tramvia is under construction. The first line began operation on 14 February 2010 and connects Florence's primary intercity railway station (Santa Maria Novella) with the southwestern suburb of Scandicci. This line is 7.4 km (4.6 mi) long and has 14 stops. The construction of a second line began on 5 November 2011, construction was stopped due to contractors' difficulties and restarted in 2014 with the new line opening on February 11, 2019. This second line connects Florence's airport with the city centre. A third line (from Santa Maria Novella to the Careggi area, where the most important hospitals of Florence are located) is also under construction.\n\n\n=== Florence public transport statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Firenze, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 59 min. 13% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 min, while 22% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.1 km, while 3% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n=== Railway station ===\nFirenze Santa Maria Novella railway station is the main national and international railway station in Florence and is used by 59 million people every year. The building, designed by Giovanni Michelucci, was built in the Italian Rationalism style and it is one of the major rationalist buildings in Italy. It is located in Piazza della Stazione, near the Fortezza da Basso (a masterpiece of the military Renaissance architecture) and the Viali di Circonvallazione, and in front of the Basilica of Santa Maria Novella's apse from which it takes its name. As well as numerous high speed trains to major Italian cities Florence is served by international overnight sleeper services to Munich and Vienna operated by Austrian railways \u00d6BB.\nA new high-speed rail station is under construction and is contracted to be operational by 2015. It is planned to be connected to Vespucci airport, Santa Maria Novella railway station, and to the city centre by the second line of Tramvia. The architectural firms Foster + Partners and Lancietti Passaleva Giordo and Associates designed this new rail station.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\n\nThe Florence Airport, Peretola, is one of two main airports in the Tuscany region though it is not widely used by popular airlines. The other airport in the Tuscany region is the Galileo Galilei International Airport in Pisa.\n\n\n=== Mobike (bike-sharing) ===\n\nMobike, a Chinese dockless bike sharing company, has been operating in Florence since July 2017. As of 2019, the company operates 4,000 bikes in Florence. The users scan the QR code on the bike using the Mobike app, and end the ride by parking curbside. The bikes have a fixed rate of \u20ac1 every 20 minutes. Since Mobike is a dock-less bike-sharing system, it does not provide stations, therefore the bikes can be left almost anywhere.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nFlorence is twinned with:\n\n\n== Other partnerships ==\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\nAntonia of Florence, saint\nAgnes of Montepulciano, saint\nHarold Acton, author and aesthete\nJohn Argyropoulos, scholar\nLeone Battista Alberti, polymath\nDante Alighieri, poet\nGiovanni Boccaccio, poet\nBaldassarre Bonaiuti, 14th-century chronicler\nSandro Botticelli, painter\nAureliano Brandolini, agronomist and development cooperation scholar\nRobert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, 19th-century English poets\nFilippo Brunelleschi, architect\nMichelangelo Buonarroti, sculptor, painter, author of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and David\nFrancesco Casagrande, cyclist\nRoberto Cavalli, fashion designer\nCarlo Collodi, writer\nEnrico Coveri, fashion designer\nDonatello, sculptor\nOriana Fallaci, journalist and author\nSalvatore Ferragamo, fashion designer and shoemaker\nMike Francis (born Francesco Puccioni), singer and composer\nSilpa Bhirasri (born Corrado Feroci), sculptor, credited as the principal figure of modern art in Thailand.\nFrescobaldi Family, notable bankers and wine producers\nGalileo Galilei, Italian physicist, astronomer, and philosopher\nGiotto, early 14th-century painter, sculptor and architect\nLorenzo Ghiberti, sculptor\nGuccio Gucci, founder of the Gucci label\nBruno Innocenti, sculptor\nRobert Lowell, poet\nNiccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, poet, philosopher and political thinker, author of The Prince and The Discourses\nMasaccio, painter\nRose McGowan, Florence-born actress\nMedici family\nGirolamo Mei, historian and humanist\nAntonio Meucci, inventor of the telephone\nFlorence Nightingale, pioneer of modern nursing, and statistician\nVirginia Oldoini, Countess of Castiglione, early photographic artist, secret agent and courtesan\nValerio Profondavalle, Flemish painter\nGiulio Racah (1909\u20131965), Italian-Israeli mathematician and physicist; Acting President of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem\nRaphael, painter\nAnna Sarfatti, children's author\nGirolamo Savonarola, reformist\nAdriana Seroni, politician\nGiovanni Spadolini, politician\nAntonio Squarcialupi, organist and composer\nEvangelista Torricelli, Italian physicist\nGiorgio Vasari, painter, architect, and historian\nAmerigo Vespucci, explorer and cartographer, namesake of the Americas\nLeonardo da Vinci, polymath\nLisa del Giocondo, model of the Mona Lisa\nGiorgio Antonucci, physician, psychoanalyst and an international reference on the questioning of the basis of psychiatry\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCategory:Buildings and structures in Florence\nChancellor of Florence\nCronaca fiorentina\nEuropean University Institute\nFlorentine School\nHistorical states of Italy\nList of squares in Florence\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nFlorence Art Museums\nThe High Renaissance in Florence \u2013 Video\nUNESCO video",

          "My family was here in October 2018. I recommend this place to must see. I have a photo taken just right on the Lion statue fountain. A lot of my friends were asking where this photo was? They didn't believe it was in Italy coz they never been there. I would say, please visit",
          "This plaza is farther to the north in Rome. We came here after going to the Borghese Museum and the park and on our way to the Spanish Steps. The plaza is large so despite huge crowds, it doesn't feel crowded. We slowly marveled at the size of the place, walking from one side",
          "This Piazza is a 7-8 minute walk from the Spanish Steps and rarely part of a tour of Rome. I love this Piazza with it's fountains and the beautiful twin cathedrals! Left one is Santa Maria in Montesanto, 1662-75, and Santa Maria dei Miracoli, 1675-79. The obelisk in the center",

          "We stumbled across here on the way to the Borghese park. It is worth seeing the fountains and the obelisk in the centre (yep thats egyptian!). It is worth climbing the hill to see the view over the whole area, there are steps you can climb which is worth it. The sculptures",
          "Piazza del Popolo is a large urban square in Rome. I won't go out of your way to see this square, not as good as all the others, climb the steps to top to get a view of landscape - it's the best part, lots of shops nearby",

          "Given the weight of 'Very Good' and 'Excellent' reviews on TA we feel a little mean rating at 'Average'. Perhaps it was the scaffolding obscuring one side of the piazza...but we don't think so. Yes it's a vast tranquil space, yes the surrounding architecture is ornate, yes the",
          "Even though this square is not included among the first 5 most famous signts of Rome I think it is indeed at least as beautiful and impacting as Piazza Navona. The square offers beautiful perspectives for pictures from different angles, and at night becomes one of the most",
          "We loved it so much we went twice in a four day trip. The fact that this spectacular, historic piazza is minutes from the Spanish steps and minutes from the Pincio, palace Medici and the parc Borghese is a treat. The twin churches, the 1900years old second tallest Egyptian",

          "We started our walking tour of Rome here on our first day. It is to the north of most of the places we wanted to see so thought it was a great starting point moving southward. The Leonardo Da Vinci Museum is located right here as well as a lot of restaurants are located close",

          "This was the old traditional north entrance to Rome. Today, there are other entrances but many locals and tourists come here to see the churches and more just in this square. There is an obelisk there too which once graced a temple in Egypt. It was brought to this square in",
          "A defendant must see but the sidewalk cafe's are expensive. Situated next the Park Villa Borghese. Beware of the men dressed as Roman Centurions in the park. They want to take a picture with you and then demand 10 euro for there trouble",
          "One of the first place we visited and what a view we had when we finally reached the top. It was a long way up but well worth it. It's also a great spot to enjoy your gelato in the square and just take a little break from all the walking and sightseeing! Located a short walk",

          "Once the entrance to Rome from the North and the Piazza del Popolo is the perfect gateway to Rome to give a taste of the grandeur to come. It has a bloody history (doesn\u2019t all Rome?) with it being the last place to host public executions in Rome but this isn\u2019t to distract from",
          "Add this to your Bucket List when visiting Rome! Here you can sip wine, beer, or whatever from one of the sidewalk cafe's while watching all the people walk by. Stop in to visit a local church to admire its beauty. All of the boutique shops and gelato options will have you",

          "This is one square in Rome that is never quiet \u2013 it is always bustling. This square is named after the poplar, a deciduous tree of the willow family and was designed by Giuseppe Valadier between 1811 and 1822. There used to be a central fountain, but it was moved to Piazza",
          "Very large area to sit and have a rest. It is just under the city park and close to Spanish steps. Large squares like this one is one of the nice characteristics of Rome.",
          "Located just inside the northern gate to the old city, the square is the start of Via Flaminia and was the main entrance into the city during Roman times. Within the confines of the square, there is a lot to see; Flaminio Obelisk, Santa Maria dei Popolo, Santa Maria dei Miracoli",

          "This fountain sits on the west side of the Piazza and is mate to the fountain opposite. Statuary is Neptune standing with trident in hand, flanked by two mermen each with a dolphin. The water feature is rather uninspiring, compared to the statuary; it consists of a simple bowl",
          "Fun plaza full of fountains but plenty of open spaces. Not to crowded, but lots of folks having fun at various improvised activities. Worth a few minutes if you are headed to Borgeses or the adjoining park.",

          "This place is big, airy and lots of space. The statues, lion fountains, churches and many other buildings surrounding the piazza are magnificent. However, we were disappointed that there are no seats to stretch your legs with all that walking you do. I mean Rome is a tourist",

          "I visited this piazza on two occasions during my visit to Rome, and when the sun is out, this square is sensational. The rays of the sun reflect beautifully on the white masonry of the buildings and flood the piazza with light. I am no believer but it is pretty magical. On a",

          "The fountain and Obelisk are the centre piece, of a very impressive piazza (see review, Piazza Del Popolo). Some could say a fountain is a fountain, however we are always impressed how different the many fountains of Rome are. We especially like this one as four lions surround",
          "Located on the surrounds of Piazza del Popolo, stands the monumental fountain of Neptune (with two attendants), constructed in the early 1800 as part the aqueduct system. This ornate fountain adds to the beauty of a very impressive square.",

          "From this piazza stretch Rome's three grandest boulevards, and from the centre you can see right to the Emmanuel monument, the heart of Rome. Two churches sit at the apex of the boulevards, marking a grand entrance to the square. 'You want to know what town planning is? That's",
          "Walking along towards the centre during the day is good, but at night when it is all light up even better. People watching at its best too. The nativity scene was set out around the base of the needle, certainly worth seeing. Was also amazed to find free public toilets!",
          "Piazza is a huge open square, decorated at the corners, with three churches, way up to the Pincio Hill. Central point is decorated with an obelisk and a fountain with lions. We just want to have some more greenery closer to the central point. Main decoration of the square is",
          "The People's Plaza was (apparently) a place to hang convicts or whoever the local ruler or the Emperor didn't like! Yikes! Now people go to just sit and relax, or climb the steps to overlook the plaza, or visit the Da Vinci museum next door, or appreciate the nice marble work",
          "The square is big and not very crowded. Take your time to feel the city around it and take photos while enjoying your gelato.",
          "The 2nd largest piazza I have seen in Rome so far. The lights that decorated the piazza because it's Christmas time made it prettier. It's beautiful already plus the buildings that surround it make it an awesome place to spend some time hand in hand. There are live musical",
          "It's a beautiful place in Rome you really have to go. Incredible statues and temples close to Villa Borghese",
          "During my first visit to Rome over 10 years ago we started exploring the city from here. Of course, the obelisk with the fountain of lions were the first attractions in the square. After that I`ve met many squares in Rome with obelisks and fountains : Piazza Navona, Piazza della",
          "It wasn\u2019t much to see while we were there, though there are some nice churches, we enjoyed the street musicians cover of stairway to heaven softly echoing through the beautiful church we went in. I hear the flea market here on Sundays is worth the stop and regretted going to the",
          "We started here to make a walk down Via del Corso to Piazza Venezia. Lots of shops, interesting to see people (by that, I mean Tourist, like me :). I guess I was really disappointed that we couldn't go into Cheese di Santa Maria del Popolo, it was closed and seemed to be worked",
          "Due to my inability to read a map correctly we ended up in Piazza del Popolo after visiting the Spanish Steps. There was a marathon being run that day so a lot of the area/square was marked off and inaccessible. There is not much in the way of shade in this square, so on a warm",
          "We literally stumbled into the massive gate that separates this piazza from the street. Not the most popular or most visited, but way less crowded. We greatly enjoyed being able to get photos of us, without 500 total strangers in the pic with us. A museo of da Vinci is there",
          "Via Borgezi is a huge garden where you actually need something like a gulf Cart to navigate and it\u2019s reasonably affordable to rent this cart. Then we come down and see Piazza del Popolo",
          "Piazza del Popolo has so much to see and do. Museums, history, fountains, an Egyptian obelisk, basilicas...it\u2019s adjacent to gardens and the head of the street with some of the best designer shops in Rome. Wander the square, explore the adjacent museums, have a coffee and people",

          "We first walked to the square from the westerly side of Villa Borghese. This large square has the impressive Obelisk Flamino from Egypt in the center and is the home of at least two old churches, Santa Maria Montesanto and Santa Maria Miracoli. Both are worth dropping into.",
          "Fabulous place. Amazing sculptures. Lovely atmosphere . Fabulous surrounding buildings . We visited this square most days as our hotel was nearby and we loved it so much.",
          "This is a hug plaza and is perfect central point for a walk about-a bit of a walk but doable to walk to the Spanish steps, Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon. and its a great place to people watch and visit the church.",
          "Close to Piazza Spagna and other attractions, it\u2019s a good place to start one of many walking tours or to catch a breath after walking on the many tiny streets with cobblestones (to rest your feet a bit). Great views, churches and the traditional (stolen) obelisk make the square",
          "We started a tour from here. Nice large square - 2 nearly identical churches and the metro is nearby. Can walk to the Spanish Steps pretty easily from here. After entering the main arched entry from the main street/metro side if you go to the left and up a bit of hill and then",
          "A brief and pleasant walk from the base of the Spanish Steps, this is a huge open area. I am sure it does get crowded but the morning we were there it was quite wide open and easy to criss cross and view the various monuments, fountains and statues.There are quite a few spots",
          "Fontana Dei Leoni In Piazza Del Popolo is a nice fountain, as far as fountains go, but it is not a great one. There are numerous other fountains in Rome where you can spend hours admiring and relaxing, but this one is worth seeing for a short time and then move on. The piazza",
          "Great place for people watching or for meeting up with a walking tour. The great Basilica Santa Maria in Popolo is there as well as Villa Borghese above. There are fountains a plenty to wash your face or refill your water bottle and you have three roads (the Tridente) to",
          "Wonderful view and huge square. If you also have nice weather, it would be great. It's a nice place to stay and calm down.",

          "This Fontana del Nettuno is a beautiful fountain in Piazza del Popolo, in central Rome. Some reviewers have confused it with the one of the same name in Piazza Navona. Perhaps they should check all details before pressing the submit button for their review! We found all these",
          "The day we visited was the day we also had a thunderstorm.. first rain in 4 months for this beautiful city and much needed as the Piazza looked very clean with all the dust washed off!",
          "While the name in modern Italian means \"People's Square\", the name actually comes from the poplar tree (populus in Latin). A favourite of mine to visit, this large urban square has standing at its center the magnificent Egyptian obelisk of Ramesses II while in its perimeter",
          "Walked from the Spanish Steps to Piazza del Popolo. A bit of a walk but what a grand sight. Then walked from the Piazza to the Vatican. Now that's a walk!",
          "We stayed not far from this square.Great atmosphere and joined by 3 churches. The church near the Leonardo experience museum holds 3 paintings by Caravaggio, a must see.",
          "Me and my wife stopped off here on the way back from visiting the Vatican City in October 2017. You step out of the metro station and you are right in the main square. If you look directly to your left you will see some stairs, if you go up them you then see a park and you climb",
          "We went at night, and the entire structure was breathtaking. I'm not Catholic, so I approach this from a slightly different perspective, I admit. But the architecture is beautiful and quite historic. Think of all of the movies and actual news that have featured this very view",
          "The Piazza Del Popolo, or People's Square, is absolutely vast. It was really bus yon our visit but not as crowded as other piazzas like Navonna or St.Peter's. There are lots of nice restaurants and cafes along its edge and there were lots of locals here which I always take to be",
          "We were staying at the Hotel de Russie and our room had a view of this beautiful square. It is not as crowded as other areas like the Spanish steps, but there's plenty of activity. Something always seems to be going on, but on a smaller scale. Feels like a lot more locals and",
          "Connect this attraction with the Piazza of Spania or event the Castel of Sant'Angel. It is located at the edge of the tourist's perimeter and you will not miss more than 30 minutes exploring this interesting site with fountains, stairs, churches and the Egyptian-style obelisk.",
          "Piazza del Popolo is a very large public square, in a central location in Rome. It is quite family friendly and you will see many people around. There are a couple of fountains and also an obelisk in the middle. There are many cafes, restaurants and other shops in the areas",
          "After the noise and push of Rome, it's nice to hit a quiet spot. There's a little less going on in this piazza and thus fewer crowds. Still there's lots to admire around the area, lots of art to look at. As well there are a few eating spots around the square for a drink or",
          "Not so crowded when compared to the Spanish Steps. Less hawkers too I guess it\u2019s because there are less tourists there. Not a bad idea to do some budget shopping there. And just a 10 minutes walk to the Spanish Steps area where you can do some crazy shoppings.",
          "We were on an all-day \"guide yourself\" tour of Rome. The Piazza del Popolo was the drop-off point and the meeting pint for our tour group. We had been to the huge square during a previous visit to Rome and consequently, we were quite familiar with the square. When we returned",

          "This is a very beautiful piazza. Lots to do and see around it, or you can sit near the fountains. Just be careful with the men selling roses! They'll try to force you to buy a rose if you touch it",
          "Great during the day or evening as can be peaceful. Avoid all men with bunches of roses - you touch the rose you have to buy it and they will force them on you! Otherwise a great place to visit and good access to the spanish steps and trevi fountain!",
          "Piazza del Popolo is a large urban square in Rome. Well they say this piazza was the traveller's first view of Rome upon arrival and for centuries, it was a place for public executions. It wasn't in our list initially but glad we took a hault for a while here. It's a really nice",
          "This is a nice square to come to if you have time to walk around and enjoy watching people go about their daily lives. It is surrounded by an array of cafes and restaurants which is convenient.",
          "This piazza wasn't on our list until a tour we were on to Pompeii met here. It's not Piazza Navona but it is really nice with a big fountain in the middle, beautiful arches and statues.",
          "Very large piazza which was great! Took some awesome photos here and we noticed there were a variety of places you could go and see from churches, parks to museums. Could quite easily spend most of the day around here. As always, be aware of your bags and wallets (which is",
          "Sitting at a cafe eating pizza while watching the tourists is one of the main features of the Piazza del Popolo. It's a huge plaza with a fountain that everyone stops to take selfies of. The pizza isn't that great---not a good spot for food. Have a cold drink and watch the",
          "We did the Dolce Vita stroll as recommended by Rick Steves. My recommendation is to do this on a weekend (Saturday preferably). Take the metro to Flamino, walk down Via del Corso and make your way to the Spanish Steps. We even crammed dinner, the mausoleum of Augustus and the",

          "We arrived here in the afternoon and the square was hosting a concert. So we were not able to see it properly, non the less it was interesting. We continued our journey on to Pincio.",
          "Piazza del Popolo is a \"must visit\" location in the center of Rome. Nice historical churches of Santa Maria (one of the churches was closed for restoration during of our visit), and the ancient obelisk of Ramesses II of Egypt, relocated to the square from the Circus Maximus.",
          "When I'm reading some other comments I wonder where these people were. Definitely the yevn don't don't know which part of the world. On The Piazza Navona there are 3 beautifel fountains, but this one is on the Piazza del Popolo! There are many great fountains in the city, but",
          "This was the first time that I'd visited this area of Rome (after quite a few visits) and I'm disappointed that I hadn't come across it before. It's a really nice example of Roman piazzi with an excellent obelisk as a centre-piece and great architecture all around.",
          "Me and my partner popped in briefly to take photos on the way home from the Vatican,very beautiful place with lovely statues. Would recommend a visit here if staying in Rome for a few days.",
          "Saw the square from up the Villa Borghese gardens and we went down to view. So lovely. A lot of artistry. Shame we had no time to explore further but it's very picturesque",
          "Sitting here in the evening was such a beautiful feeling in the very depths of summer. The ground was hot but the feeling was spectacular.",
          "There is so much more here than a beautiful square. There are the statues, fountains and obelisk that everyone wants pictures of. A trip up the steps leads to the Borghease Gardens which are beautiful in themselves and offer great views and photo opportunities of the square",
          "Our group was staying in a nearby hotel so we came down here to enjoy some local color. A number of people were here just relaxing. Nice place to meet and spend some time with the locals.",

          "This is a beautiful Piazza with some stunning sculptures and architecture around.....well worth the visit. Its a 5/10 minute walk to the Spanish Steps so perfect to tie in with a visit there. The church nearby is stunning to pop your head in too!!",
          "Wonderful gathering spot with excellent sculptures and good people watching. Visit Santa Maria del Popolo from here and climb up to the next level (not sure of name) for great view with St. Peter's in the background.",

          "Coming from the Metro we walked through here to the left there are steps that lead to a park. Look straight ahead past the monument in the centre of Piazza de Popolo. Keep walking up the street & you will come to the Spanish Steps. This is a beautiful huge open Piazza del Popolo",
          "The Piazza deal Popolo sits at the northern end of the Via del Corso but also allowing easy access to the streets that run parallel to the Via del Corso as well as the Borghese Gardens and it's not from the Piazza de Spagna and the Spanish Steps. It's really useful for picking",

          "Stand on the outside of Piazza on the Viale del Muro Torto look at the entrance to the piazza and and enter Rome by the first entrance to the city. So you need to read about the facade on the entrance, and the obelisk history. From there in front 2 churches, with three important",

          "The cafe's on the square were very expensive and there is not a lot to see here, but the walk up the hill behind was well worth it and not just for the views. A lovely park area with different sections, we only did about a 1/3 of it but will go back to explore one day.",
          "Big and lots of open vistas, but not one of the charming places to visit. Cafes to sit at, churches to visit off the nice shopping streets. Detours to the Spanish Steps - all make this a place to drop by as you'll probably be in the area anyway. But if you're running short",
          "The Piazza del Popolo was the main entrance into the city during the Roman Empire. Several of my day tours left from the Piazza, which meant I could enjoy the architecture in the early morning hours in peace and quiet ... not sure this would be the case during the day.",
          "If come walking from Via del Corso, you'll find yourself heading the center of the Piazza, just keep going straightforward. It's a lovely place to know, I enjoy reading a newspaper while having coffee here. There's an Egyptian monument, right at the center of the Piazza, one of",
          "A great place to visit but completely ruined by the ever present lookie lookie men that won't leave you alone. I have only given it an average score because couldn't relax at all and saw a disagreement between these men which looked as though it was turning nasty. Security in",
          "Imagine a beautiful sunny hot day just had an iced coffee and went to look round the square and for a sit down but no peace here. The annoying lookie lookie men trying to sell you the usual rubbish water, selfie sticks, roses that are wilting, hats even when you are wearing one",
          "We decided to enter the Borghese Gardens from the Piazza de Popolo. It is one of the large piazzas in the city and has a number of statues around the outside and fountain in the middle. We stopped for a coffee at one of the cafes that line the sidewalk and we were charged 4",
          "We took the subway to this location from the Termini to Flaminio stop. The Santa Maria del Pololo is located here as well Santa Maria in Monesanto (exterior was under construction) and the Santa Maria del Miracoli faces the piazza. A large Egyptian obelisk is in the middle of",

          "Dating back almost 450 years, the basin of the fountain is relatively plain, sculpted from reddish marble, though the shape is an interesting geometric figure. The statues were added in the 19th century to complement the others in the plaza.",

          "If you have gone all the way from the Spanish Steps or from Fontana Di Trevi, this is the natural 'turning point' to go back (probably another way). However, you can take a break at one of the nearby cafes and study the passing tourists and the general movements on the spot ...",
          "Piazza del Popolo was just in a must-see list. Like everything else in Rome it was packed with tourists",
          "Very crowded and there are a good number of rude and obnoxious junk sellers that do not take \"No Grazie\" as a sign to leave you alone. Most good things are inside. Look at the architecture and photo the many statues on the top of buildings. Sun Screen needed, there is little",

          "Steve and I visited this square a couple of times last week. It is very popular with the tourists and is also the home to the Da Vinci museum. Why not climb the steps at the side of the museum, which leads up to a very popular public park and offers stunning views across Rome.",
          "Beautiful Piazza with Chiesa di Santa Maria del Popolo to visit and witness the signs from the Da Vinci Code literature. The church also has 2 masterpieces by Caravaggio!",
          "Pleasant square with nice fountain, but there are more nice ones in Rome. and the square is windy. yes.",

          "A very alive, vibrant piazza, the popular meeting spot. The place itself is amazing and astonishing. Around you, there are a lot of historical buildings. There can be a lot of people on the plazza, but it doesn't get crowded because it's so spacious. A must - see!",
          "This is where Mussolini could speak to packed crowds apparently and I know why - it is such a big place and not over-run by cars. It has the obligatory Egyptian obelisk in the middle, but is generally just a great place to people watch.",
          "Probably the biggest piazza in Rome itself, it is a meeting place for locals and the old entry point to Rome for travellers. Head up the steps towards Borghese for a great view across the piazza and over to the Vatican.",
          "I went to this Piazza a couple of times on my recent trip to Rome. It is a popular meeting place for tours to leave from and that is why I was there. It has a gorgeous fountain in the middle and restaurants around the perimeter. The Santa Maria del Popolo is there as well and",

          "We rented an apartment that was one block from this plaza and thought it might be a little bit too out of the way, but we were wrong on many levels! There are 3 main roads that go south of the plaza and each can provide access to distinct parts of the city without leading you",
          "For me this is the most beautiful piazza in Rome, for its peace and tranquility, great proportions and simple beauty of sculptures around there. It is advised to climb up to Villa Borghese park to look at the square from above.",

          "I visited during a rainy October day so I might have missed the hordes of tourist, but I found the city lovely, with plenty of opportunities to climb your way away from the most trafficked roads and finding some little pearls by yourself. I was just turned off by the multitude",

          "We approached frem Urbino, via the hills and back roads, and you glimpse the towers and the cliff face from over 20kms away - unbelievable! The best time to be in the centre is early morning, before the crowds of day visitors arrive. Mke sure that you do walk the city wall",
          "Now among my top favorites this beautiful mountain top city is a great destination but not for those who aren't physically fit. There are numerous stairs and winding hilly roads, but so worth the exploration. Numerous little shops and eateries to select from and wonderful",

          "Easy to get to taking the bus from Rimini opposite the main station. The return costs \u20ac10 and runs frequently. Expect a lot of pushing getting on to the bus as no one queues. Bus drops you right at the entrance to the historical city centre and it\u2019s good to spend a few hours",
          "Beautiful town, a lot of walking but it\u2019s all worth it, gorgeous scenarios and a fascinating history. Truly recommend it. We parked on parking number 9 and did lots of stairs to reach the top and it was all worth it at the end.",

        "wiki": "Agatha of Sicily (c. 231 \u2013 c. 251 AD) is a Christian saint. Her memorial is on 5 February. Agatha was born at Catania or Palermo, Sicily, and she was martyred in approximately 251. She is one of seven women, who, along with the Blessed Virgin Mary, are commemorated by name in the Canon of the Mass.She is the patron saint of Catania, Molise, Malta, San Marino, Gallipoli in Apulia, and Zamarramala, a municipality of the Province of Segovia in Spain. She is also the patron saint of breast cancer patients, martyrs, wet nurses, bell-founders, bakers, and invoked against fire, earthquakes, and eruptions of Mount Etna.\n\n\n== Early history ==\nAgatha is buried at the Badia di Sant'Agata, Catania.  She is listed in the late 6th-century Martyrologium Hieronymianum associated with Jerome, and the Synaxarion, the calendar of the church of Carthage, ca. 530. Agatha also appears in one of the carmina of Venantius Fortunatus.Two early churches were dedicated to her in Rome, notably the Church of Sant'Agata dei Goti in Via Mazzarino, a titular church with apse mosaics of ca. 460 and traces of a fresco cycle, overpainted by Gismondo Cerrini in 1630. In the 6th century AD, the church was adapted to Arianism, hence its name \"Saint Agatha of Goths\", and later reconsecrated by Gregory the Great, who confirmed her traditional sainthood.\nAgatha is also depicted in the mosaics of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo in Ravenna, where she appears, richly dressed, in the procession of female martyrs along the north wall. Her image forms an initial I in the Sacramentary of Gellone, which dates from the end of the 8th century.\n\n\n== Life ==\nOne of the most highly venerated virgin martyrs of Christian antiquity, Agatha was put to death during the persecution of Decius (250\u2013253) in Catania, Sicily, for her determined profession of faith.Her written legend comprises \"straightforward accounts of interrogation, torture, resistance, and triumph which constitute some of the earliest hagiographic literature\", and are reflected in later recensions, the earliest surviving one being an illustrated late 10th-century passio bound into a composite volume in the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France, originating probably in Autun, Burgundy; in its margin illustrations Magdalena Carrasco detected Carolingian or Late Antique iconographic traditions.\n\nAccording to the 13th-century Golden Legend (III.15) by Jacobus de Voragine,  fifteen-year-old Agatha, from a rich and noble family, made a vow of virginity and rejected the amorous advances of the Roman prefect Quintianus, who thought he could force her to turn away from her vow and marry him. His persistent proposals were consistently spurned by Agatha. This was during the persecutions of Decius, so Quintianus, knowing she was a Christian, reported her to the authorities. Quintianus himself was governor of the district.He expected her to give in to his demands when she was faced with torture and possible death, but she simply reaffirmed her belief in God by praying: \"Jesus Christ, Lord of all, you see my heart, you know my desires. Possess all that I am. I am your sheep: make me worthy to overcome the devil.\" With tears falling from her eyes, she prayed for courage. To force her to change her mind, Quintianus sent Agatha to Aphrodisia, the keeper of a brothel, and had her imprisoned there. Agatha never lost her confidence in God.Quintianus sent for her again, argued, threatened, and finally had her imprisoned and tortured. She was stretched on a rack to be torn with iron hooks, burned with torches, and whipped. Amongst the tortures she underwent was the cutting off of her breasts with pincers. After further dramatic confrontations with Quintianus, represented in a sequence of dialogues in her passio that document her fortitude and steadfast devotion, Agatha was then sentenced to be burnt at the stake, but an earthquake saved her from that fate; instead, she was sent to prison where St. Peter the Apostle appeared to her and healed her wounds.Agatha died in prison, probably in the year 251 according to the Legenda Aurea. Although the martyrdom of Agatha is authenticated, and her veneration as a saint had spread beyond her native place even in antiquity, there is no reliable information concerning the details of her death.Osbern Bokenham, A Legend of Holy Women, written in the 1440s, offers some further detail.\n\n\n== Veneration ==\nAccording to Maltese tradition, during the persecution of Roman Emperor Decius (AD 249\u2013251), Agatha, together with some of her friends, fled from Sicily and took refuge in Malta. Some historians believe that her stay on the island was rather short, and she spent her days in a rock-hewn crypt at Rabat, praying and teaching the Christian Faith to children. After some time, Agatha returned to Sicily, where she faced martyrdom. Agatha was arrested and brought before Quintanus, praetor of Catania, who condemned her to torture and imprisonment. The crypt of St. Agatha is an underground basilica, which from early ages was venerated by the Maltese. At the time of St. Agatha's stay, the crypt was a small natural cave which later on, during the 4th or 5th century, was enlarged and embellished.After the Reformation era, Agatha was retained in the calendar of the Church of England's Book of Common Prayer with her feast on 5 February. Several Church of England parish churches are dedicated to her.\n\n\n=== Festival of Saint Agatha in Catania ===\n\nThe Festival of Saint Agatha in Catania is a major festival in the region, it takes place in the first five days of February. The Catania Cathedral (also known as Cattedrale di Sant'Agata) is dedicated to the saint.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Patronage ==\n\nSaint Agatha is the patron saint of rape victims, breast cancer patients, wet nurses, and bellfounders (due to the shape of her severed breasts). She is also considered to be a powerful intercessor when people suffer from fires. Her feast day is celebrated on February 5. \nShe is also a patron saint of Malta, where in 1551 her intercession through a reported apparition to a Benedictine nun is said to have saved Malta from Turkish invasion.She became the patron saint of the Republic of San Marino after Pope Clement XII restored the independence of the state on her feast day of February 5, 1740.She is also the patron saint of Catania, Sorihuela del Guadalimar (Spain), Molise, San Marino and Kalsa, a historical quarter of Palermo.\nShe is claimed as the patroness of Palermo. The year after her death, the stilling of an eruption of Mount Etna was attributed to her intercession. As a result, apparently, people continued to ask her prayers for protection against fire.In Switzerland Agatha is considered the patron saint of fire services.\n\n\n== Iconography ==\n\nSaint Agatha is often depicted iconographically carrying her excised breasts on a platter, as in Bernardino Luini's Saint Agatha (1510\u20131515) in the Galleria Borghese, Rome, in which Agatha contemplates the breasts on a standing salver held in her hand.\nThe tradition of Agatha Buns, Agatha bread, or so-called St Agatha's Breasts or Minne di Sant'Agata (Italian/Sicilian for Breasts of St. Agatha) or Minni di Virgini (Italian/Sicilian for Breasts of (a) virgin), served or blessed on her feast day, is found in many countries.\nThe small round fruit buns are iced and topped with a cherry, intended to represent breasts.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nBasques have a tradition of gathering on Saint Agatha's Eve (Basque: Santa Ageda bezpera) and going round the village. Homeowners can choose to hear a song about her life, accompanied by the beats of their walking sticks on the floor or a prayer for the household's deceased. After that, the homeowner donates food to the chorus. This song has varying lyrics according to the local tradition and the Basque language. An exceptional case was that of 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, when a version appeared that in the Spanish language praised the Soviet ship Komsomol, which had sunk while carrying Soviet weapons to the Second Spanish Republic.\nAn annual festival to commemorate the life of Saint Agatha takes place in Catania, Sicily, from February 3 to 5. The festival culminates in an all-night procession through the city.St. Agatha's Tower is a former Knight's stronghold located in the north west of Malta. The seventeenth-century tower served as a military base during both World Wars and was used as a radar station by the Maltese army.\n\n\n=== Saint Agatha in art ===\n\nAgatha is a featured figure on Judy Chicago's 1979 installation piece The Dinner Party, being represented as one of the 999 names on the Heritage Floor.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nIncorruptibility\nList of Catholic saints\nSaint Agatha of Sicily, patron saint archive\nSanta Gadea, a church of historical importance devoted to Agatha, located in Burgos\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"St Agatha - St Peter's Square Colonnades\"\n\"Here Followeth the Life of St. Agatha,\" from Jacobus Voragine, The Golden Legend, tr.

        "wiki": "Marche ( MAR-kay, Italian: [\u02c8marke] (listen)) or the Marches ( MAR-chiz) is one of the twenty regions of Italy. The name of the region derives from the plural name of marca, originally referring to the medieval March of Ancona and nearby marches of Camerino and Fermo. Marche is well known for its shoemaking tradition, with fine and luxurious Italian footwear manufacturing facilities in the region.The region is located in the Central area of the country, bordered by Emilia-Romagna and the republic of San Marino to the north, Tuscany to the west, Umbria to the southwest, Abruzzo and Lazio to the south and the Adriatic Sea to the east. Except for river valleys and the often very narrow coastal strip, the land is hilly. A railway from Bologna to Brindisi, built in the 19th century, runs along the coast of the entire territory. Inland, the mountainous nature of the region, even today, allows relatively little travel north and south, except by twisting roads over the passes. The Umbrian enclave of Monte Ruperto (a subdivision of the Comune of Citt\u00e0 di Castello) is entirely surrounded by the Province of Pesaro and Urbino, which constitutes the northern part of the region. Urbino, one of the major cities of the region, was the birthplace of Raphael, as well as a major center of Renaissance history.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMarche extends over an area of 9,694 square kilometres (3,743 sq mi) of the central Adriatic slope between Emilia-Romagna to the north, Tuscany and Umbria to the west, and Lazio and Abruzzo to the south, the entire eastern boundary being formed by the Adriatic. Most of the region is mountainous or hilly, the main features being the Apennine chain along the internal boundary and an extensive system of hills descending towards the Adriatic. With the sole exception of Monte Vettore, 2,476 metres (8,123 ft) high, the mountains do not exceed 2,400 metres (7,900 ft). The hilly area covers two-thirds of the region and is interrupted by wide gullies with numerous \u2013 albeit short \u2013 rivers and by alluvial plains perpendicular to the principal chain. The parallel mountain chains contain deep river gorges, the best known being those of the Furlo, the Rossa and the Frasassi.\nThe coastal area is 173 kilometres (107 mi) long and is relatively flat and straight except for the hilly area between Gabicce and Pesaro in the north, and the eastern slopes of Monte Conero near Ancona.\nClimate is temperate. Inland, in the mountainous areas, is more continental with cold and often snowy winters; by the sea is more mediterranean. Precipitation varies from 1,000 to 1,500 millimetres (40 to 60 inches) per year inland and 600 to 800 mm (25 to 30 in) per year on the Adriatic coast.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMarche was known in ancient times as the Picenum territory. The Picens or Picentes (Ancient Greek: \u03a0\u03af\u03ba\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2) were the Italic tribe who lived in Picenum during the Iron Age. Many artefacts from their time are exhibited in National Archaeological Museum of the Marche Region in Ancona. In the fourth century BC, the northern area was occupied by the Senones, a tribe of Gauls. The Battle of Sentinum was fought in Marche in 295 BC; afterwards, the Romans founded numerous colonies in the area, connected to Rome by the Via Flaminia and the Via Salaria. Ascoli was a seat of Italic resistance during the Social War (91\u201388 BC).\n\nFollowing the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the region was invaded by the Goths. After the Gothic War, it was part of the Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna (Ancona, Fano, Pesaro, Rimini, and Senigallia forming the so-called Pentapolis). After the fall of the Exarchate, it was briefly in the possession of the Lombards, but was conquered by Charlemagne in the late eighth century. In the ninth to eleventh centuries, the marches of Camerino, Fermo and Ancona were created, hence the modern name.\nMarche was nominally part of the Papal States, but most of the territory was under local lords, while the major cities ruled themselves as free communes. In the twelfth century, the commune of Ancona resisted both the imperial authority of Frederick Barbarossa and the Republic of Venice, and was a maritime republic on its own. An attempt to restore Papal suzerainty by Gil de Albornoz in the fourteenth century was short-lived.\n\nDuring the Renaissance, the region was fought over by rival aristocratic families, such as the Malatesta of Rimini, Pesaro, Fano and the house of Montefeltro of Urbino. The last independent entity, the Duchy of Urbino, was dissolved in 1631, and from then on, Marche was firmly part of the Papal States except during the Napoleonic period. This saw the short lived Republic of Ancona, in 1797\u201398; the merging of the region with the Roman Republic in 1798\u201399, and with the Kingdom of Italy from 1808 to 1813; and the short occupation by Joachim Murat in 1815. After Napoleon's defeat, Marche returned to Papal rule until 4 November 1860, when it was annexed to the unified Kingdom of Italy by a plebiscite.\nAfter the referendum of 2006, 7 municipalities of Montefeltro were detached from the Province of Pesaro and Urbino to join the Province of Rimini (Emilia-Romagna) on 15 August 2009. The municipalities are Casteldelci, Maiolo, Novafeltria, Pennabilli, San Leo, Sant'Agata Feltria and Talamello.\nTowns in Marche were devastated by the 2016 Central Italy earthquake which occurred on 24 August 2016.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nPrior to the 1980s, Marche was considered a rather poor region, although economically stable in some sectors, thanks particularly to its agricultural output and to the contribution of traditional crafts.Today the contribution of agriculture to the economy of the region is less significant and the gross value generated by this sector remains slightly above the national average. Marche has never suffered from the extremes of fragmented land ownership or 'latifondo'. Greatly diffused in the past, the sharecropping never produced an extreme land fragmentation. The main products are cereals, vegetables, animal products and grapes. Truffle hunting is popular; although it has often led to 'truffle wars' between hunters due to the imposition of quotas.  Olives are also produced and managed by various harvesters. In spite of the marine impoverishment, the sea has always furnished a plentiful supply of fish, the main fishing centres being Ancona, San Benedetto del Tronto, Fano and Civitanova Marche.Since the 1980s the economy of the region has been radically transformed, without however repudiating its rural past. Many of the small craft workshops scattered throughout the rural settlements have modernised and become small businesses, some of which have become major brands known all over the world (Indesit, Tod's, Guzzini, Teuco). This evolution led to the emergence of 'specialised' industrial areas, which are still profitable: footwear and leather goods in a large area straddling the provinces of Macerata and Fermo; furniture in the Pesaro area in particular; household appliances and textile industry in the province of Ancona, in which the main engineering companies are also to be found (including ship building, petrochemicals and paper, as well as consumer durables). The city of Castelfidardo remains an important centre for the production of musical instruments, the accordion in particular. The region continues to draw tourists, whose increasing numbers have been attracted by the rich and broadly distributed heritage of history and monuments, as well as by the traditional seaside resorts.The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 43.3 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 2.5% of Italy's economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 28,200 euros or 94% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 96% of the EU average.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population density in the region is below the national average. In 2008, it was 161.5 inhabitants per square kilometre (418/sq mi), compared to the national figure of 198.8/km2 (515/sq mi). It is highest in the province of Ancona (244.6/km2 or 634/sq mi inhabitants per km2), and lowest in the province of Macerata (116.1/km2 or 301/sq mi). Between 1952 and 1967 the population of the region decreased by 1.7% as a result of a negative migration balance, well above the national average, with a rate varying between 4.9 and 10.0 per 1,000 inhabitants. The Average fund of this region is worth about a few million or maybe higher. In the same period the natural balance of the population was positive, but lower than the national average and insufficient to counterbalance the net emigration. The population continued to decline until 1971, but in 1968 began growing again. In 2008, the Italian national institute of statistics (ISTAT) estimated that 115,299 foreign-born immigrants live in Marche, 7.4% of the total regional population.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nMarche forms, along with Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany and Umbria, the Italian \"Red Quadrilateral\", a strongly left-wing area. In the 2014 European elections, the people of Marche gave 45% of their votes to Matteo Renzi's Democratic Party.\nIt is one of the very few regions in Italy where the right-wing coalition led by Silvio Berlusconi has never been able to have a majority, either in a national election or at the regional level.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe region is divided into five provinces: Ancona, Ascoli Piceno, Fermo, Macerata, Pesaro e Urbino.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Marche travel guide from Wikivoyage\nOfficial Website of the Marche Regional Council\nPhoto gallery made by a UNESCO photographer.",

        "wiki": "San Marino ( (listen), Italian: [sam ma\u02c8ri\u02d0no]), officially the Republic of San Marino (Italian: Repubblica di San Marino; Romagnol: Rip\u00f3bblica d' San Marein), also known as the Most Serene Republic of San Marino (Italian: Serenissima Repubblica di San Marino), is a microstate in Southern Europe completely enclosed by Italy.Located on the northeastern side of the Apennine Mountains, San Marino covers a land area of just over 61 km2 (24 sq mi), and has a population of 33,562. Its capital is the City of San Marino and its largest settlement is Dogana. San Marino's official language is Italian.\nThe country derives its name from Saint Marinus, a stonemason from the then Roman island of Rab, in modern-day Croatia. Born in AD 275, Marinus participated in the reconstruction of Rimini's city walls after their destruction by Liburnian pirates. Marinus then went on to find an independent monastic community on Monte Titano in AD 301; thus, San Marino lays claim to being the oldest extant sovereign state, as well as the oldest constitutional republic.San Marino's politics are ruled by its constitution, which dictates that every six months San Marino's parliament must elect two Captains Regent. The Captain Regents have equal powers, and are free to exercise them within the limits of the constitution and parliamentary legislation until their term expires.\nThe country's economy is mainly based on finance, industry, services and tourism. It is one of the wealthiest countries in the world in terms of GDP per capita, with a figure comparable to the most developed European regions. San Marino is considered to have a highly stable economy, with one of the lowest unemployment rates in Europe, no national debt and a budget surplus.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSaint Marinus left the island of Rab in present-day Croatia with his lifelong friend Leo, and went to the city of Rimini as a stonemason. After the Diocletianic Persecution following his Christian sermons, he escaped to the nearby Monte Titano, where he built a small church and thus founded what is now the city and state of San Marino.\nThe official founding date is 3 September 301. In 1320 the community of Chiesanuova chose to join the country. In 1463 San Marino was extended with the communities of Faetano, Fiorentino, Montegiardino, and Serravalle, after which the country's borders have remained unchanged.In 1503, Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander VI occupied the Republic for six months until his father's successor, Pope Julius II, intervened and restored the country's independence.On June 4, 1543 Fabiano di Monte San Savino, nephew of the later Pope Julius III, attempted to conquer the republic, but his infantry and cavalry failed as they got lost in a dense fog, which the Sammarinese attributed to Saint Quirinus, whose feast day it was.After the Duchy of Urbino was annexed by the Papal States in 1625, San Marino became an enclave within the Papal States, something which led to its seeking the formal protection of the Papal States in 1631, but this never equalled a de facto Papal control of the republic.The country was occupied on October 17, 1739 by the legate (Papal governor) of Ravenna, Cardinal Giulio Alberoni, but the independence was restored by Pope Clement XII on February 5, 1740, the feast day of Saint Agatha, after which she became a patron saint of the republic.The advance of Napoleon's army in 1797 presented a brief threat to the independence of San Marino, but the country was saved from losing its liberty thanks to one of its regents, Antonio Onofri, who managed to gain the respect and friendship of Napoleon. Thanks to his intervention, Napoleon, in a letter delivered to Gaspard Monge, scientist and commissary of the French Government for Science and Art, promised to guarantee and protect the independence of the Republic, even offering to extend its territory according to its needs. The offer was declined by the regents, fearing future retaliation from other states' revanchism.\n\nDuring the later phase of the Italian unification process in the 19th century, San Marino served as a refuge for many people persecuted because of their support for unification, including Giuseppe Garibaldi and his wife Anita.\nThe government of San Marino made United States President Abraham Lincoln an honorary citizen. He wrote in reply, saying that the republic proved that \"government founded on republican principles is capable of being so administered as to be secure and enduring.\"During World War I, when Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915, San Marino remained neutral and Italy adopted a hostile view of Sammarinese neutrality, suspecting that San Marino could harbour Austrian spies who could be given access to its new radiotelegraph station. Italy tried to forcibly establish a detachment of Carabinieri in the republic and then cut the republic's telephone lines when it did not comply. Two groups of ten volunteers joined Italian forces in the fighting on the Italian front, the first as combatants and the second as a medical corps operating a Red Cross field hospital. The existence of this hospital later caused Austria-Hungary to suspend diplomatic relations with San Marino.After the war, San Marino suffered from high rates of unemployment and inflation, leading to increased tensions between the lower and middle classes. The latter, fearing that the moderate government of San Marino would make concessions to the lower class majority, began to show support for the Sammarinese Fascist Party (Partito Fascista Sammarinese, PFS), founded in 1922 and styled largely on their Italian counterpart. PFS rule lasted from 1923 to 1943, and during this time they often sought support from Benito Mussolini's fascist government in Italy.\n\nDuring World War II, San Marino remained neutral, although it was wrongly reported in an article from The New York Times that it had declared war on the United Kingdom on 17 September 1940. The Sammarinese government later transmitted a message to the British government stating that they had not declared war on the United Kingdom.Three days after the fall of Benito Mussolini in Italy, PFS rule collapsed and the new government declared neutrality in the conflict. The Fascists regained power on 1 April 1944 but kept neutrality intact. Despite that, on 26 June 1944, San Marino was bombed by the Royal Air Force, in the belief that San Marino had been overrun by German forces and was being used to amass stores and ammunition. The Sammarinese government declared on the same day that no military installations or equipment were located on its territory, and that no belligerent forces had been allowed to enter. San Marino accepted thousands of civilian refugees when Allied forces went over the Gothic Line. In September 1944, it was briefly occupied by German forces, who were defeated by Allied forces in the Battle of San Marino.\nSan Marino had the world's first democratically elected communist government \u2013 a coalition between the Sammarinese Communist Party and the Sammarinese Socialist Party, which held office between 1945 and 1957.San Marino is the world's smallest republic, although when Nauru gained independence in 1968 it challenged that claim, Nauru's land mass being only 21 km2 (8.1 sq mi). However Nauru's jurisdiction over its surrounding waters covers 431,000 km2 (166,000 sq mi), an area thousands of times greater than the territory of San Marino. San Marino became a member of the Council of Europe in 1988 and of the United Nations in 1992. It is neither a member of the European Union nor of the Eurozone, although it uses the euro as its currency.\nDuring the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic, as of June 2020, San Marino had the highest death rate per capita of any country.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSan Marino is an enclave (landlocked) surrounded by Italy in Southern Europe, on the border between the regions of Emilia Romagna and Marche and about 10 km (6.21 mi) from the Adriatic coast at Rimini. Its hilly topography, with no flat ground, is part of the Apennine mountain range. The highest point in the country, the summit of Monte Titano, is 749 m (2,457 ft) above sea level. San Marino has no still or contained bodies of water of any significant size.\nIt is one of only three countries in the world to be completely enclosed by another country (the others being Vatican City, also enclosed by Italy, and Lesotho, enclosed by South Africa). It is the third smallest country in Europe, after Vatican City and Monaco, and the fifth smallest country in the world.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of San Marino is a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa), with continental influences, having warm summers and cool winters that are typical of inland areas of the central Italian peninsula. Snowfalls are common and heavy almost every winter, especially above 400\u2013500 m of altitude.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nSan Marino has the political framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic: the captains regent are both heads of state and heads of government, and there is a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Grand and General Council. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.\nSan Marino is considered to have the earliest written governing documents still in effect, as the Statues of 1600 are still at the core of its constitutional framework.San Marino was originally led by the Arengo, initially formed from the heads of each family. In the 13th century, power was given to the Grand and General Council. In 1243, the first two captains regent were nominated by the Council. Still today, Captains Regent are elected every six months by the Council.\nThe legislature of the republic is the Grand and General Council (Consiglio grande e generale). The Council is a unicameral legislature with 60 members. There are elections every five years by proportional representation in all nine administrative districts. These districts (townships) correspond to the old parishes of the republic. All citizens 18 years or older are eligible to vote.\nBesides general legislation, the Grand and General Council approves the budget and elects the captains regent, the State Congress (composed of ten secretaries with executive power), the Council of Twelve (which forms the judicial branch during the period of legislature of the Council), the Advising Commissions, and the Government Unions. The council also has the power to ratify treaties with other countries. The council is divided into five different Advising Commissions consisting of fifteen councilors who examine, propose, and discuss the implementation of new laws that are on their way to being presented on the floor of the council.\nEvery six months, the council elects two captains regents to be the heads of state. The regents are chosen from opposing parties so that there is a balance of power. They serve a six-month term. The investiture of the captains regent takes place on 1 April and 1 October in every year. Once this term is over, citizens have three days in which to file complaints about the captains' activities. If they warrant it, judicial proceedings against the ex-head(s) of state can be initiated.\nThe practice of having two heads of state, like Roman consuls, chosen in frequent elections, is derived directly from the customs of the Roman Republic. The Council is equivalent to the Roman Senate; the captains regent, to the consuls of ancient Rome. It is thought the inhabitants of the area came together as Roman rule collapsed to form a rudimentary government for their own protection from foreign rule.\nSan Marino is a multi-party democratic republic. A new election law in 2008 raised the threshold for small parties entering Parliament, causing political parties to organise themselves into two alliances: the right-wing Pact for San Marino, led by the San Marinese Christian Democratic Party; and the left-wing Reforms and Freedom, led by the Party of Socialists and Democrats, a merger of the Socialist Party of San Marino and the former communist Party of Democrats. The 2008 general election was won by the Pact for San Marino with 35 seats in the Grand and General Council against Reforms and Freedom's 25.\nOn 1 October 2007, Mirko Tomassoni was elected as among the heads of state, making him the first disabled person ever to have been elected as captain regent.San Marino has had more female heads of state than any other country: 15 as of October 2014, including three who served twice. With regard to the legal profession, while the Order of Lawyers and Notaries of the Republic of San Marino [Ordine degli Avvocati e Notai della Repubblica di San Marino] exists, there is no clear indication as to how demographic groups have fared in the legal field.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\n\n==== Municipalities ====\n\nSan Marino is divided into the following nine municipalities, known locally as castelli (meaning \"castles\"):\n\nSan Marino (City of San Marino, officially Citt\u00e0 di San Marino) is the capital.There are also eight minor municipalities:\n\nAcquaviva\nBorgo Maggiore\nChiesanuova\nDomagnano\nFaetano\nFiorentino\nMontegiardino\nSerravalleThe largest settlement of the Republic is Dogana, which is not an autonomous castello, but rather belongs to the Castello of Serravalle.\nIn a similar way to an Italian comune, each castello includes a main settlement, called capoluogo, which is the seat of the castello, and some even smaller localities known as frazioni.\n\n\n==== Curacies ====\nThe republic is made up of 43 parishes named curacies (It: curazie):C\u00e0 Berlone, C\u00e0 Chiavello, C\u00e0 Giannino, C\u00e0 Melone, C\u00e0 Ragni, C\u00e0 Rigo, Cailungo, Caladino, Calligaria, Canepa, Capanne, Casole, Castellaro, Cerbaiola, Cinque Vie, Confine, Corianino, Crociale, Dogana, Falciano, Fiorina, Galavotto, Gualdicciolo, La Serra, Lesignano, Molarini, Montalbo, Monte Pulito, Murata, Pianacci, Piandivello, Poggio Casalino, Poggio Chiesanuova, Ponte Mellini, Rovereta, San Giovanni sotto le Penne, Santa Mustiola, Spaccio Giannoni, Teglio, Torraccia, Valdragone, Valgiurata and Ventoso.\n\n\n=== Military ===\n\nSan Marino's military forces are among the smallest in the world. National defence is, by arrangement, the responsibility of Italy's armed forces. Different branches have varied functions, including: performing ceremonial duties; patrolling borders; mounting guard at government buildings; and assisting police in major criminal cases. The police are not included in the military of San Marino.\n\n\n==== Crossbow Corps ====\nOnce at the heart of San Marino's army, the Crossbow Corps is now a ceremonial force of approximately 80 volunteers. Since 1295, the Crossbow Corps has provided demonstrations of crossbow shooting at festivals. Its uniform design is medieval. While still a statutory military unit, the Crossbow Corps has no military function today.\n\n\n==== Guard of the Rock ====\n\nThe Guard of the Rock is a front-line military unit in the San Marino armed forces, a state border patrol, with responsibility for patrolling borders and defending them. In their role as Fortress Guards they are responsible for guarding the Palazzo Pubblico in San Marino City, the seat of national government.\nIn this role they are the forces most visible to tourists, and are known for their colourful ceremony of Changing the Guard. Under the 1987 statute the Guard of the Rock are all enrolled as \"Criminal Police Officers\" (in addition to their military role) and assist the police in investigating major crime. The uniform of the Guard of the Rock is a distinctive red and green.\n\n\n==== Guard of the Grand and General Council ====\nThe Guard of the Grand and General Council commonly known as The Guard of the Council or locally as the \"Guard of Nobles\", formed in 1741, is a volunteer unit with ceremonial duties. Due to its striking blue, white, and gold uniform, it is perhaps the best-known part of the Sammarinese military, and appears on countless postcard views of the republic. The functions of the Guard of the Council are to protect the captains regent, and to defend the Grand and General Council during its formal sessions. They also act as ceremonial bodyguards to government officials at both state and church festivals.\n\n\n==== Company of Uniformed Militia ====\nIn former times, all families with two or more adult male members were required to enroll half of them in the Company of Uniformed Militia. This unit remains the basic fighting force of the armed forces of San Marino, but is largely ceremonial. It is a matter of civic pride for many Sammarinese to belong to the force, and all citizens with at least six years residence in the republic are entitled to enroll.\nThe uniform is dark blue, with a kepi bearing a blue and white plume. The ceremonial form of the uniform includes a white cross-strap, and white and blue sash, white epaulets, and white decorated cuffs.\n\n\n==== Military Ensemble ====\nFormally this is part of the Army Militia, and is the ceremonial military band of San Marino. It consists of approximately 60 musicians. The uniform is similar to that of the Army Militia. Military Ensemble music accompanies most state occasions in the republic.\n\n\n==== Gendarmerie ====\nEstablished in 1842, the Gendarmerie of San Marino is a militarised law enforcement agency. Its members are full-time and have responsibility for the protection of citizens and property, and the preservation of law and order.\nThe entire military corps of San Marino depends upon the co-operation of full-time forces and their retained (volunteer) colleagues, known as the Corpi Militari Volontari, or Voluntary Military Force.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nSan Marino is a developed country and although it is not a European Union member, it is allowed to use the euro as its currency by arrangement with the Council of the European Union; it is also granted the right to use its own designs on the national side of the euro coins. Before the euro, the Sammarinese lira was pegged to, and exchangeable with, the Italian lira. The small number of Sammarinese euro coins, as was the case with the lira before it, are primarily of interest to coin collectors.\nSan Marino's per capita GDP and standard of living are comparable to that of Italy. Key industries include banking, electronics, and ceramics. The main agricultural products are wine and cheese. San Marino imports mainly staple goods from Italy.\nSan Marino's postage stamps, which are valid for mail posted in the country, are mostly sold to philatelists and are an important source of income. San Marino is no longer a member of the Small European Postal Administration Cooperation.It has the world's highest rate of car ownership, being the only country with more vehicles than people.\n\n\n=== Taxation ===\nThe corporate profits tax rate in San Marino is 17%, capital gains are subject to a five per cent tax, and active interest is subject to a 11% withholding tax. Several benefits apply to new businesses, which can strongly reduced the amount of taxes to be paid.\nThe personal income tax (IGR, Italian: Imposta Generale sui Redditi) was introduced in 1984 and it was heavily reformed in 2013 with the goal of increasing fiscal revenue. The nominal tax rate ranges from 9% for an annual revenue below \u20ac10,000 to 35% for revenues above \u20ac80,000.\nIn 1972, a value-added tax (VAT) system was introduced in Italy, and an equivalent tax was introduced also in San Marino, in accordance with the 1939 friendship treaty. However, this tax is not a standard value-added tax, but rather it is an import tax, thus, it is levied only on imported goods and raw resources. For this reason it is locally best known as single stage tax (Italian: imposta monofase), as it is only applied one time during importation, while VAT is applied at every exchange. Furthermore, while VAT also applies to services, the import tax only applies on physical goods. Another important difference is that while VAT is computed on the final price paid by the consumer, the import tax is levied on the importation cost paid by the company, which is generally much lower.\nUnder the European Union customs agreement, San Marino import tax is considered equivalent to the European VAT system. A separate tax on services, with a rate of 3%, has been introduced in 2011. The introduction of a true VAT system, not dissimilar from the European one, is under development.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nThe tourism sector contributes over 22% of San Marino's GDP, with approximately 2 million tourists having visited in 2014.\n\n\n=== Conventions with Italy ===\nSan Marino and Italy have engaged in conventions since 1862, dictating some economic activities in San Marino's territory.\nCultivation of tobacco and production of goods which are subject to Italy's government monopoly are forbidden in San Marino. Direct import is forbidden; all goods coming from a third party have to travel through Italy before reaching the country. Although it is allowed to print its own postal stamps, San Marino is not allowed to coin its own currency and is obliged to use Italy's mint; the agreement does not affect the right of the Republic of San Marino to continue to issue gold coins denominated in Scudi (legal value of 1 gold Scudo is 37.50 euros). Gambling is legal and regulated; however, casinos were outlawed prior to 2007. There is currently one legally operating casino.\nIn exchange for these limitations, Italy provides San Marino with an annual stipend, and at cost, sea salt (not more than 250 tonnes per year), tobacco (40 tonnes), cigarettes (20 tonnes) and matches (unlimited amount).At the border there are no formalities with Italy. However, at the tourist office visitors can purchase officially cancelled souvenir stamps for their passports.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\n\nSan Marino has a population of approximately 33,000, with 4,800 foreign residents, most of whom are Italian citizens. Another 12,000 Sammarinese live abroad (5,700 in Italy, 3,000 in the US, 1,900 in France and 1,600 in Argentina).\nThe first census since 1976 was conducted in 2010. Results were expected by the end of 2011; however, 13% of families did not return their forms.\nThe primary language spoken is Italian; Romagnol is also widely spoken.\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\nGiovanni Battista Belluzzi (1506 in San Marino \u2013 1554) an architect\nFrancesco Maria Marini (di Pesaro) (1630\u20131686), a composer, playwright, and Catholic archbishop\nAntonio Onofri (1759-1825), statesman, \"Father of his Country.\"\nLittle Tony (1941\u20132013), a pop and rock musician\nPasquale Valentini (born 1953 in San Marino), a politician who has held multiple ministerial posts\nMassimo Bonini (born 1959 in San Marino), a football player who played for Juventus\nMarco Macina (born 30 September 1964 in San Marino), a footballer who played for Bologna FC, Parma, Reggiana and AC Milan.\nValentina Monetta (born 1 March 1975 in San Marino), a singer who represented San Marino four times in the Eurovision Song Contest\nSimone Pacini (born 1981 in San Marino), a footballer who plays for local club Folgore as a midfielder\nManuel Poggiali (born 1983 in San Marino), a Grand Prix motorcycle road racing World Champion\nAlex De Angelis (born 1984 in Rimini), a Grand Prix motorcycle road racer\nDavide Simoncini (born 30 August 1986 in San Marino), a footballer who plays as a defender for San Marino club A.C. Libertas and San Marino national football team\nAldo Junior Simoncini (born 30 August 1986 in San Marino), a footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for San Marino club A.C. Libertas and San Marino national football team\nAlessandra Perilli (born 1988), shooting Olympian\nAlessandro Bianchi (born 19 July 1989 in San Marino), a San Marino international footballer who plays as a forward\nSimone Benedettini (born 1997 in San Marino), a footballer who plays as a goalkeeper\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nSan Marino is a predominantly Catholic state\u2014over 97% of the population profess the Roman Catholic faith, but Catholicism is not an established religion. Approximately half of those who profess to be Catholic practice the faith. There is no episcopal see in San Marino, although its name is part of the present diocesan title. Historically, the various parishes in San Marino were divided between two Italian dioceses, mostly in the Diocese of Montefeltro, and partly in the Diocese of Rimini. In 1977, the border between Montefeltro and Rimini was readjusted so that all of San Marino fell within the diocese of Montefeltro. The bishop of Montefeltro-San Marino resides in Pennabilli, in Italy's province of Pesaro e Urbino.\nThere is a provision under the income tax rules that the taxpayers have the right to request for allocation of 0.3% of their income tax to the Catholic Church or to charities. The churches include the two religious groups of the Waldensian Church and Jehovah's Witnesses.\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of San Marino-Montefeltro was until 1977 the historic diocese of Montefeltro. It is a suffragan of the archdiocese of Ravenna-Cervia. The current diocese includes all the parishes of San Marino. The earliest mention of Montefeltro, as Mona Feretri, is in the diplomas by which Charlemagne confirmed the donation of Pepin. The first known bishop of Montefeltro was Agatho (826), whose residence was at San Leo. Under Bishop Flaminios Dondi (1724) the see was again transferred to San Leo, but later it returned to Pennabilli. The historic diocese was a suffragan of the archdiocese of Urbino. Since 1988, there is formally an apostolic nunciature to the republic, but it is vested in the nuncio to Italy.\nThere has been a Jewish presence in San Marino for at least 600 years. The first mention of Jews in San Marino dates to the late 14th century, in official documents recording the business transactions of Jews. There are many documents throughout the 15th to 17th centuries describing Jewish dealings and verifying the presence of a Jewish community in San Marino. Jews were permitted official protection by the government.\nDuring World War II, San Marino provided a haven for more than 100,000 Italians and Jews (approximately 10 times the Sammarinese population at the time) from Nazi persecution. As of 2012, few Jews remain. In 2019 it has been inaugurated the 'Chapel of three religions', the first ever building of its kind devoted to interfaith dialogue.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nThere are 220 km (140 mi) of roads in the country, the main road being the San Marino Highway. Authorities license private vehicles with distinctive Sammarinese license plates, which are white with blue figures and the coat of arms, usually a letter followed by up to four numbers. Many vehicles also carry the international vehicle identification code (in black on a white oval sticker), which is \"RSM\".\nThere are no public airports in San Marino, but there is a small private airstrip located in Torraccia and an international heliport located in Borgo Maggiore. Most tourists who arrive by air land at Federico Fellini International Airport close to the city of Rimini, then make the transfer by bus.\nTwo rivers flow through San Marino, but there is no major water transport, and no port or harbour.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nSan Marino has limited public transport facilities. There is a regular bus service between Rimini and the city of San Marino that is popular with both tourists and workers commuting to San Marino from Italy. This service stops at approximately 20 locations in Rimini and within San Marino, with its two terminus stops at Rimini railway station and San Marino coach station.\nA limited licensed taxi service operates nationwide. There are seven licensed taxi companies operating in the republic, and Italian taxis regularly operate within San Marino when carrying passengers picked up in Italian territory.\n\nThere is a 1.5 km (0.93 mi) aerial tramway connecting the City of San Marino on top of Monte Titano with Borgo Maggiore, a major town in the republic, with the second largest population of any Sammarinese settlement. From here a further connection is available to the nation's largest settlement, Dogana, via the local bus service.\nTwo aerial tramway cars (gondolas) operate, with service provided at roughly 15-minute intervals throughout the day. A third vehicle is available on the system, a service car for the use of engineers maintaining the tramway.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\n\nToday, there is no railway in San Marino, but for a short period before World War II, it had a single narrow-gauge line called the Ferrovia Rimini\u2013San Marino which connected the country with the Italian rail network at Rimini. Because of the difficulties in accessing the capital, City of San Marino, with its mountain-top location, the terminus station was planned to be located in the village of Valdragone, but was extended to reach the capital through a steep and winding track comprising many tunnels. The railway was opened on 12 June 1932.\nAn advanced system for its time, it was an electric railway, powered from overhead cables. It was well built and had a high frequency of passengers, but was almost completely destroyed during World War II. Many facilities such as bridges, tunnels, and stations remain visible today, and some have been converted to parks, public footpaths, or traffic routes.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe Three Towers of San Marino are located on the three peaks of Monte Titano in the capital. They are depicted on both the flag of San Marino and its coat of arms. The three towers are: Guaita, the oldest of the three (it was constructed in the 11th century); the 13th-century Cesta, located on the highest of Monte Titano's summits; and the 14th-century Montale, on the smallest of Monte Titano's summits, still privately owned.\n\n\n=== University ===\nThe Universit\u00e0 degli Studi della Repubblica di San Marino (University of the Republic of San Marino) is the main university, which includes the Scuola Superiore di Studi Storici di San Marino (Graduate School of Historical Studies), a distinguished research and advanced international study centre governed by an international Scientific Committee coordinated by the emeritus historian Luciano Canfora. Other important institutes are the Istituto Musicale Sammarinese (Sammarinese Musical Institute) and the Akademio Internacia de la Sciencoj San Marino or Accademia Internazionale delle Scienze San Marino (International Academy of Sciences San Marino). The latter is known for adopting Esperanto as the language for teaching and for scientific publications; further, it makes wide use of electronic educational technology (also called e-learning).\nItalian author Umberto Eco had attempted to create a \"university without physical structures\" in San Marino.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nIn San Marino football is the most popular sport. Basketball and volleyball are also popular. The three sports have their own federations, the San Marino Football Federation, the San Marino Basketball Federation and the San Marino Volleyball Federation.\nThe San Marino national football team has had little success, being made up of part-timers, never qualifying for a major tournament, and recording only one win in over 25 years of its history, a 1\u20130 victory in 2004 against Liechtenstein. They have drawn four more, with their most notable result being a 1993 0\u20130 draw with Turkey during the European qualifiers for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. In the same qualifying competition Davide Gualtieri scored a goal 8.3 seconds into a match against England; this goal held the record for the fastest in international football until 2016.\n\nA Formula One race, the San Marino Grand Prix, was named after the state, although it did not take place there. Instead, it was held at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in the Italian town of Imola, about 100 km (60 mi) northwest of San Marino. Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna suffered fatal accidents a day apart during the 1994 Grand Prix. This international event was removed from the calendar in 2007.\nThe San Marino and Rimini's Coast motorcycle Grand Prix was reinstated in the schedule in 2007 and takes place at the Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli, as does San Marino's round of the World Superbike Championship.\nSan Marino has a professional baseball team which plays in Italy's top division. It has participated in the European Cup tournament for the continent's top club sides several times, hosting the event in 1996, 2000, 2004, and 2007. It won the championship in 2006 and was a runner-up in 2010.Together with Italy, San Marino held the 2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, with teams playing at the Stadio Olimpico in Serravalle.\nSan Marino has had little success at the Olympic Games, winning no medals.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nThe cuisine of San Marino is extremely similar to Italian, especially that of the adjoining Emilia-Romagna and Marche regions, but it has a number of its own unique dishes and products. Its best known is probably the Torta Tre Monti (\"Cake of the Three Mountains\" or \"Cake of the Three Towers\"), a wafer layered cake covered in chocolate depicting the Three Towers of San Marino. The country also has a small wine industry.\n\n\n=== UNESCO ===\nThe site San Marino: Historic Centre and Mount Titano became part of the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2008. The decision was taken during the 32nd Session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee composed of 21 Countries convened in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nThe country has a long and rich musical tradition, closely linked to that of Italy, but which is also highly independent in itself. A well-known 17th-century composer is Francesco Maria Marini. The pop singer Little Tony achieved considerable success in the United Kingdom and Italy in the 1950s and 1960s.\nSan Marino has taken part in the Eurovision Song Contest ten times, achieving two final qualifications to date (with then-three, eventually four-time contestant and San Marino native Valentina Monetta with \"Maybe\" in 2014 and Turkish singer Serhat with \"Say Na Na Na\" who achieved 19th place in the final in 2019).\n\n\n=== Public holidays and festivals ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAssociazione Guide Esploratori Cattolici Sammarinesi\nCity-state\nIndex of San Marino\u2013related articles\nOutline of San Marino\nPostage stamps and postal history of San Marino\nTelecommunications in San Marino\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Geographic data related to San Marino at OpenStreetMap\nSan Marino at Curlie\n Wikimedia Atlas of San Marino",

          "This is a lovely old town with incredible views that is well worth visiting. San Marino is one of my favourite of the European microstates. It perches on top of a craggy mountain and looks like something from a fairytale from a distance. The well preserved castle walls and",

          "A wonderful historic city with lot's of small shops and restaurants in narrow streets. Filled with tourists from all over the world. Take a cable car ride up to the castle if you are not fit enough to walk through the steep streets. Unfortunately with a lot of weapon and gun",
          "We came here during off season and I already thought it was crowded. All the perfume, leather and luxury goods stores combined with the very clean streets give the whole town a flair of DisneyLand. It just looks to good to be true, boarding on kitch. I wouldn't want to go there",

          "Lovely old town but just a little bit manicured and lacking that \"lived in\" ambience. It clearly gets bus loads of tourists and, as a consequence, has all of the commercial tatt that goes with that but it seems to accommodate all that without losing too much integrity. It's",
          "You can see whole San Marino from the top of the city! You can also buy lots of parfumes and things... I only missed a good restaurant, there are mostly pizzas and fast foods. For people who likes history and old cities the City of San Marino is a good choice. The only problem",

          "San Marino is a lovely locale. It's a stratified city in the sense that it is located on the side of a mountain. The city is attracts less tourists than other nearby sites. It is known for its shopping and conventions. There are gorgeous views from many angles. I was told",

          "Situated on the top of Mount Titano, the price you pay for heavenly views of the surrounding countryside and towns is walking up and down steep cobblestone city streets. A fair trade to me! Lots of shopping (perfume, leather bags, and, of all things, air soft guns are big here).",

        "wiki": "The Rucellai Sepulchre is a small funerary chapel built inside the Rucellai Chapel of the church of San Pancrazio, Florence. It was commissioned by Giovanni di Paolo Rucellai and built to designs by Leon Battista Alberti in imitation or emulation of the Holy Sepulchre in the Anastasis in Jerusalem. It contains the tombs of Giovanni Rucellai and members of his family.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Rucellai sepulchre is known by various names, including Sacellum of the Holy Sepulchre, Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre, Italian: Tempietto del Santo Sepolcro, Sacello del Santo Sepolcro and Tempietto Rucellai.\n\n\n== History ==\nAlberti's work on the Rucellai Chapel and on the sepulchre within it probably began in about 1458; the origins of the chapel date to 1417, when the walls of the nave of San Pancrazio were built. According to the inscription above the door, the Sepulchre was completed in 1467.\nThe Rucellai Chapel was closed for many years for restoration. Since 16 February 2013 it has been re-opened to the public. Access is through the Marino Marini Museum, which occupies the deconsecrated part of the church of San Pancrazio.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe inner walls and vault of the sepulchre are entirely frescoed, work that one author has attributed to Giovanni da Piamonte.\n\n\n=== Inscriptions ===\nThe sepulchre has two inscriptions: one, on a square panel above the door, reads:\n\nmeaning approximately \"Giovanni di Paolo Rucellai, in order that his salvation might be prayed for from where, through Christ, the resurrection of all was achieved, had this temple built in the shape of the tomb in Jerusalem [in] 1467\".\nThe other inscription runs round the top of the building and reads:\n\nYHESVM QVERITIS NAZARENVM CRVCIFIXVM SURREXIT NON EST HIC ECCE LOCVS VBI POSVERVNT EVM\nor approximately \"you seek Jesus of Nazareth who was crucified; he rose, he is not here; this is the place where they put him\".\n\n\n=== Gallery: exterior ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "La7 is an Italian free-to-air television channel owned by Cairo Communication. Until 2013 it was owned by Telecom Italia Media and operated by Telecom Italia. The head office is located in Rome.\nSignal overspill means that parts of Albania, Croatia, Switzerland, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, San Marino, the Vatican City and Slovenia also receive La7 broadcasts.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Telemontecarlo ===\n\nTele Monte Carlo (TMC) was the Italian language television channel from the Principality of Monaco. Telemontecarlo was founded in 1974 in the Principality of Monaco. During that time, the channel was the only competitor of Italian public television network RAI, broadcasting in colour. Since the introduction of Mediaset channels, TMC survived with some difficulties until 2001, but already in 1999 the last owner, the film producer Vittorio Cecchi Gori, sold the network to SEAT Pagine Gialle.\nThe first show transmitted by Telemontecarlo was Un peu d'amour, d'amiti\u00e9 et beaucoup de musique (A Little Bit of Love, Friendship and a Lot of Music), hosted by Jocelyn, who couldn't speak proper Italian at the time. \nOn 12 March 1982, RAI acquired the remaining 10% of the network. On 4 August 1985, Brazilian company Organiza\u00e7\u00f5es Globo acquired the remaining 90%. The programming changed and included more Brazilian programmes like telenovelas and other television series. The channel also broadcast the Rio Carnival live. In general, the channel adopted the same station identification and commercial bumpers from Rede Globo, the largest commercial TV network in South America and the second-largest commercial TV network in annual revenue worldwide just behind the American ABC Television Network and the largest producer of telenovelas, with the music and graphics being adapted for the channel.\nIn 1993 Telemontecarlo became a member of Eurovision Network where they were broadcast parts of 1992 Summer Olympics, the 1992 America's Cup and the UEFA Euro 1992 football championship.\nIn 1994, Italian film producer Vittorio Cecchi Gori, who at that time already owner of Videomusic, acquired TMC, and then, in 1996, created TMC2 to compete with RAI and Mediaset networks. However, his intentions were thwarted and ratings were at an all-time low, because the channel lacked nationwide coverage in Italy. It was also at the time, in 1992, Organiza\u00e7\u00f5es Globo took 15% of the shares in the new third TV channel in Portugal, SIC, which may have hurt TMC.\nIn 1996, the channel also tried to acquire the television rights of Serie A, competing against RAI. On 10 March 2000 the channel broadcast the Italian premiere of Sex and the City.\nIn 1999 Vittorio Cecchi Gori sold the network to SEAT Pagine Gialle (part of Telecom Italia holding) and the channel moved from its historical headquarters in Monte Carlo to a new building in Rome.\n\n\n=== La7 ===\nIn 2001, Lorenzo Pellicioli and Roberto Colaninno of Telecom Italia announced they had acquired Telemontecarlo, to create a strong competitor against the six other national channels in Italy. On 24 June 2001, the network changed the station name to La7. \nAgainst the initial premises, like the hiring of popular TV hosts, anchors and journalists,  La7 ratings and shares were much lower than its major competitors. However, in 2010\u20132011, the channel began doubling its rates, also thanks to current News director Enrico Mentana and his news program TG La7. \nOn 4 March 2013, it was announced the acquisition by Urbano Cairo's Cairo Editore. The sale was effective from 30 April 2013.\n\n\n== Programmes ==\n\n\n=== Shows ===\nG'Day with Geppi Cucciari, evening comedy show, airing at 19:20 every weekday;\n(ah)iPiroso with Antonello Piroso, former La7 News & Sports director, and former tennis player Adriano Panatta, and writer Fulvio Abbate;

          "Mirabilandia had a good number of rides and I greatly enjoyed them. I would say my favorite is Katun, I was able to go on it 3 times in one visit. The park has a wide variety of rides that got you wet, which they were very nice when it is a \u2026",
          "Nice Park. Operations from hell.\n\nWaiting Time of the top attractions (date 18.07.2020 - afternoon):\nKatun - 10 Minutes \niSpeed - 90 Minutes (no downtime or other circumstances - capacity: estimated 200 persons per hour (!?!) - and also: no \u2026",
          "i remember how mirabilandia was amazing now u mast waiting one hour for ispeed  when queue isn't so big and drifting cars show that was the most disappointing because it's 30 minutes when for 15 minutes 2 men are talking and cars are driving some about 4 times. 3 years ago they did incredible things.",
          "One of the bests parkland in Italy and one of the place for everyone where have fun in the summer! The rides are really amazing, safe and cool!",
          "Must see. Recommended to buy Flash pass in advance, to avoid long queues. Buy it online not in the same day or you will pay almost twice.",
          "Only queues and again queues, some attractions are closed and some others are running half capacity reducing the amount of people accepted.\nPlease give yourself a favour and avoid Mirabilandia.",
          "I love going to there again because the place is full of entertainment.",
          "Great place, but I still have to go to Energylandia in Poland :)",
          "Overall it's a nice experience. I go there almost every year for the past 5-6 years or so and it was great every time. This time however I was pretty disappointed as most rides were closed, especially the new ones, with no notice as why \u2026",
          "Amazing experience i really recommend this place! I would say these games are the most extreme once I've ever tried! Definitely will visit again \u2764\ufe0f",
          "The price is ok and it was very fun there. For a family trip I totally recommend it. Try all. Some of the rides are extrem to bei honest and even though I am an adult I was scared on some rides but it was fun though. I would recommend \u2026",
          "We had so much fun here and ispeed was great. I don't care about the lack of decent restaurants but some closed attractions were a real disappointment. Some rides that were open on Saturday, on Sunday were closed!? I do not believe that it \u2026",
          "The perfect place for all the family. My favourite ride is the ISPEED. The staff is really friendly. As expected, one is expected to wait for some rides but if the need be, one can easy buy priority tickets. Go, relax and enjoy the RIDES",
          "The amusement park is very big and perhaps most people who like such facilities will like it but not me. First you pay for the parking, then you pay almost 40 EUR per person for admission. Then you go inside and after first included in the \u2026",
          "Very interesting and you have fun there.",
          ":( Would give five stars, but been there on the first weekend with closed water part, even it was still summer out there. What a pity they look only the callendar...\nDo not go just for one day.",
          "This is such a great amusement park! You have rides for everybody, from awesome roller coasters to gentle rides for kids. If it's hot the water rides can cool you off. We were here during the week and off-season so there was no crowd and no \u2026",
          "It was one of the best experiences of my life \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03",

          "Funny adventure park for every ages",
          "Great fun, plenty to go at with queues going down quickly.  At least you don\u2019t get cold coz it is usually 30c!",
          "Great fun for the whole family. It's a huge place and there's too much to do in one day,  fortunately they offer free entrance for your second day entrance. Great roller-coaster rides very impressive. The ducati track under construction looks mind blowing. We will go again.",
          "For years we were going to Gardaland. We also enjoyed here, 2 days. Mirabilandia was open till dark.",
          "Great place for kids and adults. Reserve at least one full day to pass in all the great attractions.",
          "Amazing park. We really enjoyed it especially our 4 years old kid. Although for some rides we waited for about 1 hour but still we had fun.",
          "This amusement park was the first park in my whole life so I can not compare it to other, but for my experience it was amazing . I tried it in September so there were no queues to the rides so I tried lots of different rides. I liked the \u2026",
          "Spent 2 days here. Took the bus in and out. Was the beginning of the season, so it was very quiet. Unfortunately Ducati world wasn't open yet, but my dad loved the hot wheels show. Lots of nice shows to choose from and great musical vibe throughout the park.",
          "Fun park to go to! We went on a very warm day and therefore it was very busy in the park, causing very long waiting lines. The park was decorated very nicely and it was cleaned all around. There wasn't much choice for food however, though there were plenty of rollercoasters to go to that really boosted my adrenaline.",
          "Long waiting and in special day some palace area are closed , like new atrraction ducati world. The price for express way Is so expensive like 50\u20ac per person",
          "The most entertaining place I've been in so far, many extreme adrenaline pumping rides and amazing beautiful views",

          "Very nice fun Park... We spend some great time. Some rides are like in USA, very nice. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d.. Flashpass cost a lot, but we did not have to wate at all, at the rides \ud83d\udc4d... And using them as often we like \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4c",
          "Everyone who's been here knows how great the park is. The attention to detail in nearly every aspect is amazing. My only feedback to Mirabilandia, on this visit, is I was surprised how many rides were having trouble. We were on two of them \u2026",
          "6 hours in the park...waiting times up to 1,5 hour per attraction. Too crowded, too expensive. Fast Pass 49\u20ac additional on regular 38\u20ac and price is changing every day! Without fast pass you can do max. 4-5 attractions in one complete day. \u2026",
          "Main problem is too many people and waiting cues over 30 minutes (max was 50 minutes) for main attractions. Big park to visit. It has great shows, and attractions from 2 till 99 years old adrenaline junkies ;)",
          "Its the best activity park out there, would be better if the employees could speak a little bit more english because of the tourists :)",
          "Funny place where you can easily spend a day. Or two.",
          "It was really fun. I went there for the Halloween experience and I was truly terrified.",
          "Every year we go to Mirabilandia because it is really great\ud83d\ude17",
          "Ducati attraction closed. Others open late... katum is great",
          "Great place to spend a day (or two) with the family. Lots of attractions to choose from. You'll find something for every age group.",
          "Nice experience, not to missed for any kid 3+ in the area. The park is closing to early. Some attractions close at 17:00.",
          "It's an incredible theme park with water slides too..perfect for all the family!it's our second visit there!!",
          "Fabulous for kids and grown-ups alike, with plenty to do on a day out or two (free entrance on your second day is a good bonus). Like most parks, if all, it's a tad expensive on extras.",
          "Very cool definitely should go there, especially the iSpeed rollercoaster",
          "Stay away... Unless you are sure nobody else will go than you. Every attraction need literally hours of waiting in line. And was not just a bad day today.. Is evidently proven by fact they there are signal that with no asheme say 50 or 60 \u2026",
          "Incredible! So fun! Shame the Ducati ride wasn't working thought",
          "This park would be really perfect, if there would be mantained very old and traditional attractions like Rio Bravo, Niagara, Autosplash. It is a pity that I can remember how they used to look like at the start. I don't think that it is a good attitude to let those attractions ruin... Try to evaluate this.",
          "It is hit and miss park. They have really good rides, like Katun or divertical. But there are rides, which just doesn't work like they should. Like reset or desmo race. And whole ducati area just lacks something. basically It is worth the visit, but it could be even better.",
          "Just great time spent in this amusement park, recommend 100%, not only for children!!",
          "Fun for all ages. After gardaland i think it even might be better, the rides are insane and less lines to wait and also the priority ticketa are very affordable. Best park in Italy! Spend 3 days there... I am 28 years old xD",
          "Nice rides, but waiting time to long",
          "Very good Park with good rollercoaster but if you have a GoPro It's strictly forbidden",
          "Great place for family and friends!!KATUN is cool!!",
          "The park is interesting for adults and children. It has various themes with great attractions.",
          "Fun place, que times may be a bit long though",
          "Th rides are really great but there were some minor technical difficulties which caused a couple of delays through the day.  Also some of the rides closed at 22:00h even though the official closing time was 23:00h.",
          "bello",
          "Please make some better rules for priority line, rotating priority people sometimes block attractions. We were waiting for hours, because lines were freezed. Then we've got stuck on top of new Ducati rollercoaster. Few attractions don't work properly. iSpeed and Katun are great rides, need to try.",
          "I had so much fun and seemed to be quite cheap for me.",
          "Attractions quite good but everything else terrible, worst food I had in a while and everything is very expensive 3 euro for little Coca-Cola? Worst part for me is that funfair inside.",
          "A great place for whole family! Kids were delighted!",

        "wiki": "Monterey Park is a city located in the western San Gabriel Valley region of Los Angeles County, California in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, United States, approximately seven miles (11 km) from the Downtown Los Angeles civic center. The city's motto is \"Pride in the past, Faith in the future\". Monterey Park is part of a cluster of cities (Alhambra, Arcadia, Temple City, Rosemead, San Marino, and San Gabriel in the west San Gabriel Valley) with a growing Asian American population. According to the 2010 Census, the city had a total population of 60,269. Monterey Park has consistently ranked as one of the country's best places to live due to its good schools, growing economy, and central location.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nFor at least seven thousand years the land was populated by the Tongva (Gabrielino) Native Americans. The Tongva lived in dome like structures with thatched exteriors, an open smoke hole for ventilation and light at the top.  Both sexes wore long hair styles and tattooed their bodies. During warm weather the men wore little clothes but the women would wear minimal skirts made of animal hides. During the cold weather they would wear animal skin capes and occasionally wore sandals made from hide of yucca fiber.  With the arrival of the Spaniards, Old World diseases killed off many of the Tongva, and by 1870 very few Native-Americans had survived. In the early 19th century the area was part of the Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel mission system and later, the Rancho San Antonio.\n\n\n=== 1860s\u20131960s ===\nFollowing the Civil War, an Italian, Alessandro Repetto, purchased 5,000 acres (20 km2) of the rancho and built his ranch house on the hill overlooking his land, about a half-mile north of where Garfield Avenue crosses the Pomona Freeway, not far from where the Edison substation is now located on Garfield Avenue.It was at this time, Richard Garvey, a mail rider for the U.S. Army whose route took him through Monterey Pass, a trail that is now Garvey Avenue, settled down in the King's Hills. Garvey began developing the land by bringing in spring water from near the Hondo River and by constructing a 54-foot-high (16 m) dam to form Garvey Lake located where Garvey Ranch Park is now. To pay for his development and past debts, Garvey began selling portions of his property. In 1906, the first subdivision in the area, Ramona Acres (named after the developer's daughter, who would also later inspire the title of the novel Ramona), was developed north of Garvey and east of Garfield Avenues.In 1916, the new residents of the area initiated action to become a city when the cities of Pasadena, South Pasadena, and Alhambra proposed to put a large sewage treatment facility in the area. The community voted itself into cityhood on May 29, 1916, by a vote of 455 to 33. The City's new Board of Directors immediately outlawed sewage plants within city boundaries and named the new city Monterey Park. The name was taken from an old government map showing the oak-covered hills of the area as Monterey Hills. In 1920, a large area on the south edge of the city broke away and the separate city of Montebello was established.By 1920, the white and Spanish-surname settlers were joined by Asian residents who began farming potatoes and flowers and developing nurseries in the Monterey Highlands area. They improved the Monterey Pass Trail with a road to aid in shipping their produce to Los Angeles. The nameless pass, which had been used as a location for western movies, was called Coyote Pass by Pioneer Masami Abe.In 1926, near the corner of Atlantic and Garvey Avenue, Laura Scudder invented the first sealed bag of potato chips. In an effort to maintain quality and freshness, Laura's team would iron sheets of wax paper together to form a bag. They would fill these bags with potato chips; iron the top closed, and then deliver them to various retailers.Real estate became a thriving industry during the late 1920s with investors attracted to the many subdivisions under development and increasing commercial opportunities. The Midwick View Estates by Peter N. Snyder, a proposed garden community that was designed to rival Bel Air and Beverly Hills. Known as the \"Father of the East Side\", Mr. Snyder was a key player in the vast undertaking in the 1920s of developing the East Side as part of the industrial base of Los Angeles. His efforts to build Atlantic Boulevard, his work with the East Side organization to bring industry to the East Side, and his residential and commercial development projects along Atlantic Boulevard (Gardens Square, Golden Gate Square, and the Midwick View Estates) were a major influence to the surrounding communities. The focal point of the Midwick View Estates was \"Jardin del Encanto\", otherwise known as \"El Encanto,\" a Spanish style building that was to serve as the administration building and community center for Midwick View Estates. The development also included an observation terrace above Jardin del Encanto and the fountain with cascading water going down the hillside in stepped pools to De La Fuente. Now known as Heritage Falls Park or \"the Cascades.\"  The Great Depression brought an abrupt end to the real estate boom, as well as the Midwick proposal. From the late 1920s, the City had little development for nearly two decades.The end of World War II resulted in a revived growth trend with explosive population gains during the late 1940s and 1950s. Until this time, the population was concentrated in the northern and southern portions of the city, with the Garvey and Monterey Hills forming a natural barrier. With the renewed growth, many new subdivisions were developed, utilizing even the previously undeveloped central area to allow for maximum growth potential. A series of annexations of surrounding land also occurred. Many veterans settled in Monterey Park and continued through the 1950s. Around this time, Japanese Americans from the West Side, Chinese Americans from Chinatown, and Latinos from East Los Angeles also began settling in the area and largely assimilated into the small-town suburban culture.\n\n\n=== 1970s\u20131990s ===\nBeginning in the 1970s, well-educated and affluent Asian Americans and Asian immigrants began settling in the west San Gabriel Valley, primarily to Monterey Park. The city council subsequently tried and failed to pass English-only ordinances. In 1985 the City Council of Monterey Park approved drafting of a proposal that would require all businesses in Monterey Park to display English language identification on business signs.In the 1980s, Monterey Park was referred to as \"Little Taipei\" or \"The Chinese Beverly Hills\". Frederic Hsieh, a local realtor who bought land in Monterey Park and sold it to newly arrived immigrants, is credited with engendering Monterey Park's Chinese American community. Many businesses from the Chinatown in downtown LA began to open up stores in Monterey Park. In the 1970s and 1980s, many affluent waisheng ren Taiwanese immigrants moved abroad from Taiwan and began settling into Monterey Park. Mandarin Chinese became the most widely spoken language in many Chinese businesses of the city during that time, displacing Cantonese that had been common previously. Cantonese has dominated the Chinatowns of North America for decades, but Mandarin is the most common language of Chinese immigrants in the past few decades. In 1983, Lily Lee Chen became the first Chinese American woman to be elected mayor of a U.S. city. By the late 1980s, immigrants from Mainland China and Vietnam began moving into Monterey Park. By the 1990 census, Monterey Park became the first city with an Asian descent majority population in the continental United States. Timothy P. Fong, a professor and director of Asian American studies at California State University, Sacramento, describes Monterey Park as the \"First Suburban Chinatown\".In the 1980s, the second generation Chinese Americans generally moved out of the old Chinatown and into the San Gabriel Valley suburbs, joining the new immigrants from Taiwan and Mainland China. From that time, with a combined influx of Vietnamese, Taiwanese and Hong Kong immigrant students at the time, Mark Keppel High School, constructed during the New Deal era and located in Alhambra, but also serving most of Monterey Park and portions of Rosemead, felt the impact of this new immigration as the student population increased dramatically, leading to overcrowding. Today, many students are second or third-generation Asian Americans.In 1988, the City of Monterey Park passed an ordinance declaring a moratorium on new building, in an attempt to regulate the rapid growth the city experienced as a result of the influx of Asian immigrants.  This moratorium was challenged and defeated in 1989 This controversial move caused many Asian residents and businesses to shift focus, establishing themselves in the neighboring city of Alhambra. When the potential loss of business revenue was recognized, \"Monterey Park went through a lot of upheaval that a lot of people regret,\" and relocation back to Monterey Park was highly encouraged in the Asian American community.Since early 1990s, Taiwanese people are no longer the majority in the city. The construction boom of shopping centers had declined, but plans for redevelopment sought to change that. High property values and overcrowding in Monterey Park have contributed to a secondary migration away from Monterey Park.\n\n\n=== 2000s-present ===\nRedevelopment produced several projects included the massive Atlantic Times Square development that opened in 2010 with ground-floor shops and restaurants. The Atlantic Times Square, which has 215,000 square feet (20,000 m2), is anchored by AMC Theatres and 24 Hour Fitness, in addition to eating establishments and other stores. The development includes 210 condos on the third through sixth floors.Monterey Park Village is a 40,000 sq. ft. shopping center on South Atlantic Boulevard commercial corridor. Tenants include: Staples, Walgreens and Togo\u2019s eatery. The CVS Center on South Garfield Avenue is a redevelopment of infill site into a 17,000 square feet (1,600 m2) neighborhood convenience center. Anchor tenant CVS Pharmacy brings a full-service drug store back to the downtown project, and the center includes a Subway sandwich shop. The 507,000-square-foot (47,100 m2) Cascades Market Place will be the largest shopping center in the city. Located along the Pomona (60) Freeway west of Paramount Boulevard, this center proposes to be a major regional shopping center for the San Gabriel Valley. The new shopping center contains a Home Depot, a Costco, Chick-fil-A, and a Guitar Center. This 45 plus acre project has great grade level visibility from the freeway.In 2017, Monterey Park was recognized as \"America's Best Places to Live 2017\" ranked at #3 by Money magazine and three local news TV stations. It also ranked at #2 in Money Magazine's \"The 10 Best Places in America to Raise a Family\".\n\n\n== Business ==\n\nThe Chinese-dominated business district, near the intersection of Garfield Avenue and Garvey Avenue, is called \"Downtown Monterey Park\". In the mid-1980s, Lincoln Plaza Hotel was built to predominantly service tourists from Taiwan and Hong Kong. Monterey Park has many choices of Hong Kong fusion cafes, there are several Cantonese seafood restaurants, as well as restaurants offering Mainland Chinese fare. A variety of cuisine can be found throughout the city.\n\n\n=== Top employers ===\nAccording to the City's 2010 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\nMonterey Park is home to the Garvey Ranch Observatory, located in Garvey Ranch Park, which is operated by the Los Angeles Astronomical Society (LAAS). It adjoins a historical museum, a classroom, and a workshop. The observatory houses an 8-inch (200 mm) refractor, a telescope making workshop, and a library containing over 1000 books. The grounds are open to the public for free astronomical observation on Wednesday evenings from 7:30PM \u2013 10:00PM, hosted by LAAS members.East Los Angeles College is located along the southern boundary of the City. The college has undergone a large-scale renovation.\nBuilt in 1929, Jardin El Encanto, otherwise known as \"El Encanto\", is a Spanish-style building located at 700 El Mercado. The building, originally the sales office for Midwick Estates, was once a USO center and speakeasy. The City invested in the renovation of this structure which has significant historic value to the community.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nMonterey Park is served by the Long Beach Freeway, (I-710), the San Bernardino Freeway (I-10), and the Pomona Freeway, SR 60.\nPublic transportation is provided by the city government, Spirit bus service and Metrolink feeder bus, the City of Montebello and the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Metro Gold Line light rail service stops at Atlantic station just south of the city limits. Metro Silver Line bus rapid transit stops at Cal State LA station, serving Monterey Park.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMonterey Park is located at 34\u00b002\u203257\u2033N 118\u00b008\u203208\u2033W.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 7.7 square miles (20 km2), of which, 7.6 square miles (20 km2) is land, and 0.04 square miles (0.10 km2) (0.39%) is water.\nThe city boundaries include Los Angeles to the west, unincorporated East Los Angeles to the south and west, Alhambra to the north, Rosemead to the northeast, Montebello to the south, and unincorporated South San Gabriel to the southeast.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== 2010 ===\nThe 2010 United States Census reported that Monterey Park had a population of 60,269.

        "wiki": "The Venetian Islands are a chain of artificial islands in Biscayne Bay in the cities of Miami and Miami Beach, Florida.  The islands are, from west to east: Biscayne Island (Miami), San Marco Island (Miami), San Marino Island (Miami Beach), Di Lido Island (Miami Beach), Rivo Alto Island (Miami Beach), and Belle Isle (Miami Beach).  Flagler Monument Island remains an uninhabited picnic island, originally built in 1920 as a memorial to railroad pioneer Henry Flagler. The islands are connected by bridges from the Miami mainland to Miami Beach.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Venetian Islands project was proposed to be much larger than what exists today. Another causeway was to be built, called \"The Drive of the Campanili.\"  The causeway would connect Hibiscus Island (south of the Venetian Islands) with Di Lido Island. The road would then continue north right up the center of Biscayne Bay, with five new islands created along its path. The roadway would then veer slightly to the northeast, where it would end at Indian Creek Village. An additional four islands would be built along two east-west roads that would connect with the causeway. One of these roads was along the current route of the Julia Tuttle Causeway and the other along the current route of the 79th Street Causeway.The original bridge (called the Collins Bridge) was built by farmer and developer John S. Collins with financial assistance from automotive parts and racing pioneer Carl G. Fisher. At the time it was completed, it was the longest wooden bridge in the world. The 2\u00bd mile wooden toll bridge opened on June 12, 1913, providing a critical link to the newly established city of Miami Beach, formerly accessible only by a ferry service.\nWhile none of these islands were built, the foundation pillings for one of them can still be seen in Central Biscayne Bay between Di Lido Island and the Julia Tuttle Causeway. The island was to be called Isola di Lolando. The demise of the island construction was due to a combination of the aftermath of the 1926 Miami Hurricane and the end of the Florida land boom of the 1920s.  The Shoreland Company went bankrupt in 1927 due to objections of \"further mutilation of the waterway\".The original wooden causeway was replaced in 1925 by a series of arch drawbridges and renamed the Venetian Causeway. Today, the causeway is a popular stretch for people to jog, ride bikes, walk dogs and stroll.  The islands offer residents a suburb feel that is located between (and within minutes of) Miami Beach's South Beach and Miami's new Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts.\n\n\n== Biscayne Island ==\nBiscayne Island is a neighborhood in the City of Miami, Florida, United States. It is also the westernmost of the Venetian Islands, a chain of artificial islands in Biscayne Bay. During the 1930s, the island was used as an airport known as Viking Airport, with a hangar, 2,600' sod runway and seaplane ramps; the airport was closed by 1937 and residential development began in the 1940s. The island is now home to apartment buildings, residential neighborhoods, and a toll plaza portion of the Venetian Causeway.\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\nAs of 2000, the population of Biscayne Island had 412 people. The zip code for Biscayne Island is 33139. The area covers 0.181 square miles (0.47 km2). As of 2000, there were 215 males and 197 females. The median age for males were 42.1 years old, while the median age for females were 48.0 years old. The average household size had 1.6 people, while the average family size had 2.4 members. The percentage of married-couple families (among all households) was 28.8%, while the percentage of married-couple families with children (among all households) was 4.0%, and the percentage of single-mother households (among all households) was 0.8%. The percentage of never-married males 15 years old and over was 19.6%, while the percentage of never-married females 15 years old and over was 14.6%.As of 2000, the percentage of people that speak English not well or not at all made up 6.9% of the population. The percentage of residents born in Florida was 24.8%, the percentage of people born in another U.S. state was 24.8%, and the percentage of native residents but born outside the U.S. was 4.7%, while the percentage of foreign born residents was 45.7%.\n\n\n== San Marco Island ==\nSan Marco Island is a neighborhood in the City of Miami, Florida, United States.  It is the 2nd westernmost of the Venetian Islands, a chain of artificial islands in Biscayne Bay.  It is between Biscayne Island and San Marino Island.  It contains upscale houses and the Venetian Causeway.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVenetian Islands Homeowners Association\nBelle Isle Residents Association\nIslands Of Calm \u2013 New York Times",

        "wiki": "Ischia  ( ISK-ee-\u0259, Italian: [\u02c8iskja]) is a volcanic island in the Tyrrhenian Sea. It lies at the northern end of the Gulf of Naples, about 30 kilometres (19 miles) from the city of Naples. It is the largest of the Phlegrean Islands. Roughly trapezoidal in shape, it measures approximately 10 km (6 miles) east to west and 7 km (4 miles) north to south and has about 34 km (21 miles) of coastline and a surface area of 46.3 square kilometres (17.9 sq mi). It is almost entirely mountainous; the highest peak is Mount Epomeo, at 788 metres (2,585 feet). The island is very densely populated, with 60,000 residents (more than 1,300 inhabitants per square km).Ischia is the name of the main comune of the island. The other comuni of the island are Barano d'Ischia, Casamicciola Terme, Forio, Lacco Ameno, and Serrara Fontana.\nIschia's main industry is tourism, centering on thermal spas that cater mostly to European (especially German), American and Asian tourists eager to enjoy the fruits of the island's natural volcanic activity, its hot springs, and its volcanic mud.\n\n\n== Geology and geography ==\nThe roughly trapezoidal island is formed by a complex volcano immediately southwest of the Campi Flegrei area at the western side of the Bay of Naples. The eruption of the trachytic Green Tuff Ignimbrite about 56,000 years ago was followed by caldera formation. The highest point of the island, Monte Epomeo (788 m (2,585 ft)), is a volcanic horst consisting of green tuff that was submerged after its eruption and then uplifted. Volcanism on the island has been significantly affected by tectonism that formed a series of horsts and grabens; resurgent doming produced at least 800 m (2,600 ft) of uplift during the past 33,000 years. Many small monogenetic volcanoes formed around the uplifted block. Volcanism during the Holocene produced a series of pumiceous tephras, tuff rings, lava domes, and lava flows. The last eruption of Ischia, in 1302, produced a spatter cone and the Arso lava flow, which reached the NE coast.\nThe surrounding waters including gulfs of Gaeta, Naples and Pozzuoli are both rich and healthy, providing a habitat for around 7 species of whales and dolphins including gigantic fin and sperm whales. Special research programmes on local cetaceans have been conducted to monitor and protect this bio-diversity.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nVirgil poetically referred to it as Inarime and still later as Arime. Martianus Capella followed Virgil in this allusive name, which was never in common circulation: the Romans called it Aenaria, the Greeks, \u03a0\u03b9\u03b8\u03b7\u03ba\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9, Pitheko\u016bsai.(In)arime and Pithekousai both appear to derive from words for \"monkey\" (Etruscan arimos, Ancient Greek \u03c0\u03af\u03b8\u03b7\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, p\u00edth\u0113kos, \"monkey\"). However, Pliny derives the Greek name from the local ceramic clay deposits, not from p\u00edth\u0113kos; he explains the Latin name Aenaria as connected to a landing by Aeneas (Princeton Encyclopedia).  If the island actually was, like Gibraltar, home to a population of monkeys, they were already extinct by historical times as no record of them is mentioned in ancient sources.\nThe current name appears for the first time in a letter from Pope Leo III to Charlemagne in 813: the name iscla mentioned there would allegedly derive from insula, though there is an argument made for a Semitic origin in I-schra, \"black island\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient times ===\nAn acropolis site of the Monte Vico area was inhabited from the Bronze Age, as Mycenaean and Iron Age pottery findings attest. Euboean Greeks from Eretria and Chalcis arrived in the 8th century BC to establish an emporium for trade with the Etruscans of the mainland. This settlement was home to a mixed population of Greeks, Etruscans, and Phoenicians. Because of its fine harbor and the safety from raids afforded by the sea, the settlement of Pithecusae became successful through trade in iron and with mainland Italy; in 700 BC Pithecusae was home to 5,000\u201310,000 people.The ceramic Euboean artifact inscribed with a reference to \"Nestor's Cup\" was discovered in a grave on the island in 1953. Engraved upon the cup are a few lines written in the Greek alphabet. Dating from c. 730 BC, it is one of our most important testimonies to the early Greek alphabet, from which the Latin alphabet descended via the Etruscan alphabet. According to certain scholars the inscription also might be the oldest written reference to the Iliad.\nIn 474 BC, Hiero I of Syracuse came to the aid of the Cumaeans, who lived on the mainland opposite Ischia, against the Etruscans and defeated them on the sea. He occupied Ischia and the surrounding Parthenopean islands and left behind a garrison to build a fortress before the city of Ischia itself. This was still extant in the Middle Ages, but the original garrison fled before the eruptions of 470 BC and the island was taken over by Neapolitans. The Romans seized Ischia (and Naples) in 322 BC.\n\n\n=== From 1st century AD to 16th century ===\n\nIn 6 AD, Augustus restored the island to Naples in exchange for Capri. Ischia suffered from the barbarian invasions, being taken first by the Heruli then by the Ostrogoths, being ultimately absorbed into the Eastern Roman Empire. The Byzantines gave the island over to Naples in 588 and by 661 it was being administered by a Count liege to the Duke of Naples. The area was devastated by the Saracens in 813 and 847; in 1004 it was occupied by Henry II of Germany; the Norman Roger II of Sicily took it in 1130 granting the island to the Norman Aldoyn de Candida created Count d\u2019Ischia; the island was raided by the Pisans in 1135 and 1137 and subsequently fell under the Hohenstaufen and then Angevin rule. After the Sicilian Vespers in 1282, the island rebelled, recognizing Peter III of Aragon, but was retaken by the Angevins the following year. It was conquered in 1284 by the forces of Aragon and Charles II of Anjou was unable to successfully retake it until 1299.\nAs a consequence of the island's last eruption in 1302, the population fled to Baia where they remained for 4 years. In 1320 Robert of Anjou and his wife Sancia visited the island and were hosted by Cesare Sterlich, who had been sent by Charles II from the Holy See to govern the island in 1306 and was by this time nearly 100 years of age.\nIschia suffered greatly in the struggles between the Angevin and Durazzo dynasties. It was taken by Carlo Durazzo in 1382, retaken by Louis II of Anjou in 1385 and captured yet again by Ladislaus of Naples in 1386; it was sacked by the fleet of the Antipope John XXIII under the command of Gaspare Cossa in 1410 only to be retaken by Ladislaus the following year. In 1422 Joan II gave the island to her adoptive son Alfonso V of Aragon, though, when he fell into disgrace, she retook it with the help of Genoa in 1424. In 1438 Alfonso reoccupied the castle, kicking out all the men and proclaiming it an Aragonese colony, marrying to his garrison the wives and daughters of the expelled. He set about building a bridge linking the castle to the rest of the island and he carved out a large gallery, both of which are still to be seen today. In 1442, he gave the island to one of his favorites, Lucretia d'Alagno, who in turn entrusted the island's governance to her brother-in-law, Giovanni Torella. Upon the death of Alfonso in 1458, they returned the island to the Angevin side. Ferdinand I of Naples ordered Alessandro Sforza to chase Torella out of the castle and gave the island over, in 1462, to Garceraldo Requesens. In 1464, after a brief Torellan insurrection, Marino Caracciolo was set up as governor.\nIn February 1495, with the arrival of Charles VIII, Ferdinand II landed on the island and took possession of the castle, and, after having killed the disloyal castellan Giusto di Candida with his own hands, left the island under the control of Innico d'Avalos, marquis of Pescara and Vasto, who ably defended the place from the French flotilla. With him came his sister Costanza and through them they founded the D'Avalos dynasty which would last on the island into the 18th century.\n\n\n=== 16th\u201318th centuries ===\nThroughout the 16th century, the island suffered the incursions of pirates and Barbary privateers from North Africa \u2013 in 1543 and 1544 Hayreddin Barbarossa laid waste to the island, taking 4,000 prisoners in the process. In 1548 and 1552, Ischia was beset by his successor Dragut Rais. With the increasing rarity and diminishing severity of the piratical attacks later in the century and the construction of better defenses, the islanders began to venture out of the castle and it was then that the historic centre of the town of Ischia was begun. Even so, many inhabitants still ended up slaves to the pirates, the last known being taken in 1796. During the 1647 revolution of Masaniello, there was an attempted rebellion against the feudal landowners.\n\n\n=== Since the 18th century ===\n\nWith the extinction of the D'Avalos line in 1729, the island reverted to state property. In March 1734 it was taken by the Bourbons and administered by a royal governor seated within the castle. The island participated in the short-lived Republic of Naples starting in March 1799 but by 3 April Commodore Thomas Troubridge under the command of Lord Nelson had put down the revolt on Ischia as well as on neighboring Procida. By decree of the governor, many of the rebels were hanged in a square on Procida now called Piazza dei martiri (Square of the Martyrs). Among these was Francesco Buonocore who had received the island to administer from the French Championnet in Naples. On 13 February 1806 the island was occupied by the French and on the 24th was unsuccessfully attacked by the British.\nOn 21st and 22 June 1809 the islands of Ischia and Procida were attacked by an Anglo-Bourbon fleet.  Procida surrendered on 24 June and Ischia soon afterwards. However the British soon returned to their bases in Sicily and Malta.On 28 July 1883, an earthquake destroyed the villages of Casamicciola Terme and Lacco Ameno.\nIn 1936 Ischia had a population of 30,418.On August 21st, 2017 Ischia had an 4.2 magnitude earthquake which killed 2 people and injured 42 more.Today, Ischia is a popular tourist destination, welcoming up to 6 million visitors per year, mainly from the Italian mainland as well as Germany (approximately 5,000 Germans are resident on the island), although it has become an increasingly popular destination for the well-to-do Eastern Europeans (particularly Russia and Poland). Ischia is easily reached by ferry from Naples, with an approximate travel time of between 40 minutes and one hour. The number of thermal spas on the islands makes it particularly popular with tourists seeking \"wellness\" holidays. A regular visitor is Angela Merkel, the German chancellor.\n\n\n== In literature and the arts ==\n\n\n=== Events ===\nThe island is home to the Ischia Film Festival, an international cinema competition celebrated in June or July, dedicated to all the works that have promoted the value of the local territory.\n\n\n=== Notable guests and works ===\nThe Italian politician Giuseppe Garibaldi, one of the most important figures of Italian unification, stayed on the island for healing himself from a serious injury and finding relief in the peaceful area of Casamicciola Terme (at the Manzi Hotel).\nIn May 1948 W. H. Auden wrote his poem \"In Praise of Limestone\" here, the first poem he wrote in Italy.\nIn 1949, British classical composer William Walton settled in Ischia. In 1956, he sold his London house and took up full-time residence on Ischia; he built a hilltop house at Forio, called it La Mortella, and Susana Walton created a magnificent garden there. Walton lived on the island for the remainder of his life and died there in 1983.\nGerman composer Hans Werner Henze lived on the island from 1953 to 1956 and wrote his Quattro Poemi (1955) there.\nSamuel Taylor's Broadway play Avanti! (1968) takes place on the island.\nHerg\u00e9's series of comic albums, The Adventures of Tintin (1907\u20131983), ends in Ischia, which serves as the location of Endaddine Akass' villa in the unfinished 24th and final book, Tintin and Alph-Art.\nFrench novelist Pascal Quignard set much of his novel Villa Amalia (2006) on the island.\nIn Elena Ferrante's series of Neapolitan Novels, the island serves as the setting of several summer holidays of the main characters.\n\n\n=== Motion picture setting ===\nIn addition to the works noted above, multiple media works have been set or filmed on the island. For example:\n\nThe American film The Crimson Pirate (1952) was filmed on the island.\nPart of Cleopatra (1963), starring Elizabeth Taylor, was filmed on the island.\nIschia Ponte stood in for 'Mongibello' in the Hollywood film of The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999).\nThe American film And While We Were Here (2012), starring Kate Bosworth, was filmed on the island of Ischia.\nIschia's Castello Aragonese was used as the 'Riva's Fortified Fortress' island in Men in Black: International (2019)\n\n\n== Wines ==\nThe island of Ischia is home to the eponymous Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) that produces both red and white wines though white wines account for nearly 80% of the island's wine production. Vineyards planted within the 179 hectares (440 acres) boundaries of the DOC tend to be on volcanic soils with high pumice, phosphorus and potassium content.The white wines of the island are composed primarily of Forastera (at least 65% according to DOC regulation) and Biancolella (up to 20%) with up to 15% of other local grape varieties such as Arilla and San Lunardo. Grapes are limited to a harvest yield of no more than 10 tonnes/ha with a finished minimum alcohol level of at least 11%. For wines labeled as Bianco Superiore, the yield is further restricted to a maximum of 8 tonnes/ha with a minimum alcohol level of 12%. Only certain subareas of the Ischia DOC can produce Bianco Superiore with the blend needing to contain 50% Forastera, 40% Biancolella and 10% San Lunardo.Red wines produced under the Ischia DOC are composed of 50% Guarnaccia, 40% Piedirosso (known under the local synonym of Per'e Palummo) and 10% Barbera. Like the white wines, red grapes destined for DOC production are limited to a harvest yield of no more than 10 tonnes/ha though the minimum finished alcohol level is higher at 11.5% ABV.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Aragonese Castle ===\nThe Aragonese Castle (Castello Aragonese, Ischia Ponte) was built on a rock near the island in 474 BC, by Hiero I of Syracuse. At the same time, two towers were built to control enemy fleets'  movements. The rock was then occupied by Parthenopeans (the ancient inhabitants of Naples). In 326 BC the fortress was captured by Romans, and then again by the Parthenopeans. In 1441 Alfonso V of Aragon connected the rock to the island with a stone bridge instead of the prior wood bridge, and fortified the walls in order to defend the inhabitants against the raids of pirates. Around 1700, about 2000 families lived on the islet, including a Poor Clares convent, an abbey of Basilian monks (of the Greek Orthodox Church), the bishop and the seminar, and the prince, with a military garrison. There were also thirteen churches. In 1912, the castle was sold to a private owner. Today the castle is the most visited monument of the island. It is accessed through a tunnel with large openings which let the light enter. Along the tunnel there is a small chapel consecrated to Saint John Joseph of the Cross (San Giovan Giuseppe della Croce), the patron saint of the island. A more comfortable access is also possible with a modern lift. After arriving outside, it is possible to visit the Church of the Immacolata and the Cathedral of Assunta. The first was built in 1737 on the location of a smaller chapel dedicated to Saint Francis, and closed after the suppression of convents in 1806, as well as the Poor Clares convent.\n\n\n=== Gardens of La Mortella ===\n\nThe gardens, located in Forio-San Francesco, were originally the property of English composer William Walton.  Walton lived in the villa next to the gardens with his Argentinian wife Susana. When the composer arrived on the island in 1946, he immediately called Russell Page from England to lay out the garden. Wonderful tropical and Mediterranean plants were planted and some have now reached amazing proportions. The gardens include wonderful views over the city and harbour of Forio. A museum dedicated to the life and work of William Walton now comprises part of the garden complex. There's also a recital room where renowned musical artists perform on a regular schedule.\n\n\n=== Gardens of Villa Ravino ===\n\nA botanical garden, located in Forio-Citara Bay, is the result of 50 years of the dedicated work of Captain Giuseppe D'Ambra, the owner of the Villa. Giardini Ravino is a botanical garden with one of the richest collection of cacti and succulents cultivated outdoors in Europe. Giardini Ravino has been the subject of an award from the OPE (European Parliamentary Observatory) for the most ecofriendly property in South Italy.\nGiardini Ravino is also the location of Meristema Fair, an exhibition dedicated to both professional and quality amateur gardeners, enriched with seminars and hands on experiences regarding biodiversity in nature.\nGiardini Ravino is also the headquarters of many social associations that organize events, in collaboration with international humanitarian aid organizations, such as MSF (Doctors Without Borders), the non-profit eco-gastronomic member-supported organization Slow Food and many other cultural exhibitions during the year around.\n\n\n=== Villa La Colombaia ===\nVilla La Colombaia is located in Lacco Ameno and Forio territories. Surrounded by a park, the villa (called \"The Dovecote\") was made by Luigi Patalano, a famous local socialist and journalist. It is now the seat of a cultural institution and museum dedicated to Luchino Visconti. The institution promotes cultural activities such as music, cinema, theatre, art exhibitions, workshops, and cinema reviews. The villa and the park are open to the public.\n\n\n=== Others ===\nSant'Angelo  (Sant'Angelo, in the comune of Serrara Fontana)\nMaronti Beach  (Barano d'Ischia)\nChurch of the Soccorso' (Forio)\nPiazza S.Restituta, with the best luxury boutiques (Lacco Ameno)\nBay of Sorgeto, with hot thermal springs (Panza)\nPoseidon Gardens \u2013 spa with several thermal pools (Panza)\nCitara Beach (Panza)\nEnglish's Beach (Ischia)\nPitthekoussai Archaeological museum\nThe Angelo Rizzoli museum\n\n\n== Voluntary associations ==\nCommittees and associations work to promote tourism on the island, and provide services and activities for residents. Among these are:\n\nIl coniglio di Rocco Alfarano, associazione per la protezione del quadrupede sull\u2019isola\nAccaparlante Societ\u00e0 Cooperativa Sociale, Via Sant'Alessandro\nAssociazione Donatori Volontari di Sangue, Via Iasolino, 1\nAssociazione Nemo per la Diffusione della Cultura del Mare, via Regina Elena, 75 Cellulare: 366-1270197\nAssociazione Progetto Emmaus, Via Acquedotto, 65\nA.V.I.

Significant acreage of land previously used for agriculture has been developed for the construction of houses and residential structures. Most of this development has taken place without any planning and building permission. As at the end of 2011, the island lacked the most basic system for sewage treatment; sewage is sent directly to the sea. In 2004 one of the five communities of the island commenced civil works to build a sewage treatment plant but since then the construction has not been completed and it is currently stopped.\nOn 14 June 2007 there was a breakage in one of the four high-voltage underwater cables forming the power line maintained by Enel S.p.A \u2014 although never authorized by Italian authorities \u2014 between Cuma on the Campania coast and Lacco Ameno on the island of Ischia. Inside each cable there is an 18 mm\u2011diameter channel filled with oil under high pressure. The breakage of the Enel cable resulted in the spillage of oil into the sea and into other environmental matrices \u2014 with the consequent pollution by polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs, the use of which was banned by the Italian authorities as long ago as 1984), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and linear alkyl benzenes (aromatic hydrocarbons) \u2014 in the \u2018Regno di Nettuno\u2019, a marine protected area, and the largest ecosystem in the Mediterranean Sea, designated as a \u2018priority habitat\u2019 in Annex I to the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) and comprising oceanic posidonia beds.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of islands of Italy\nList of castles in Italy\nList of volcanoes in Italy\nCastello d'Ischia Lighthouse\n2017 Ischia earthquake\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nRichard Stillwell, ed.

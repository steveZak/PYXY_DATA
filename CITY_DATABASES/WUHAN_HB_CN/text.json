        "wiki": "Yellow Crane Tower (simplified Chinese: \u9ec4\u9e64\u697c; traditional Chinese: \u9ec3\u9db4\u6a13; pinyin: Hu\u00e1ngh\u00e8 L\u00f3u) is a traditional Chinese tower located in Wuhan. The current structure was built in 1981, but the tower has existed in various forms from as early as AD 223. The current Yellow Crane Tower is 51.4 m (169 ft) high and covers an area of 3,219 m2 (34,650 sq ft). It is situated on Snake Hill (\u86c7\u5c71), one kilometer away from the original site, on the banks of the Yangtze River in Wuchang District.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Yuanhe Maps and Records of Prefectures and Counties, written almost 600 years after the construction of the tower, notes that after Sun Quan, founder of the kingdom of Eastern Wu, built the fort of Xiakou in 223, a tower was constructed at/on the Yellow Crane Jetty, west of Xiakou, and hence its name.The tower has been destroyed twelve times, both by warfare and by fire, in the Ming and Qing dynasties and was repaired on ten separate occasions. The last tower at the original site was built in 1868 and destroyed in 1884. In 1907, a new tower was built near the site of the Yellow Crane Tower. Zhang Zhidong proposed '\u5967\u7565\u6a13' (Aoliaolou Tower) as the name for this tower and wrote an antithetical couplet for it. In 1957, the  Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was built with one trestle of the bridge on the Yellow Crane Tower's site. In 1981, the Wuhan City Government commenced reconstruction of the tower at a new location, about 1 km (0.62 mi) from the original site, and it was completed in 1985.On January 31, 2018, Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, visited Wuhan and took pictures at the Yellow Crane Tower.\n\n\n=== Legends ===\n\nNotwithstanding the tower's current location on Snake Hill being unrelated to its original location one kilometre away, the two popular legends related to it invoke the hill. In the first, an Immortal (\u4ed9\u4eba) named Wang Zi'an (\u738b\u5b50\u5b89) rode away from Snake Mountain on a yellow crane and a tower was later built in commemoration of this story. In the second legend, Fei Yi becomes immortal and rides a yellow crane, often stopping on Snake Hill to take a rest.The tower is also a sacred site of Taoism. L\u00fc Dongbin is said to ascend to heaven from here. There is a small cave in the hill beneath the tower with L\u00fc Dongbin statue. The cave is been called L\u00fc Zu Dong, literately means cave of L\u00fc Dongbin.\n\n\n== Literature ==\n\n\n=== Poem by Cui Hao ===\nYellow Crane Tower was made famous by an 8th-century poem written by Cui Hao, titled \"Yellow Crane Tower\" (\u9ec3\u9db4\u6a13). The original text of the poem is shown below:\n\nA modern English translation is:\n\n\n=== Poem by Li Bai ===\nThere are other famous poems about the Yellow Crane Tower by Li Bai. One was written on the occasion of Li Bai parting with his friend and poetic colleague, Meng Haoran. The poem is titled \"Seeing off Meng Haoran for Guangling at Yellow Crane Tower\" (\u9ec3\u9db4\u6a13\u9001\u5b5f\u6d69\u7136\u4e4b\u5ee3\u9675), and is shown in its original form below:\n\nA modern English translation is:\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThe tower and its surroundings have been marked as Yellow Crane Tower park. There are tour services that can be hired for a fee at the entrance. The top of the tower has a broad view of its surroundings and the Yangtze River. Yellow Crane Tower is considered one of the Four Great Towers of China. In its modern version, it has the appearance of an ancient tower but is built of modern materials, including an elevator. Each level has its own display. To the east on the hill, a large temple bell may be rung by tourists for a small fee. There are court dances in the western yard during the week-long National Day of the People's Republic of China celebration. The tower is classified as an AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration. At south side of the tower, there is a statue of Yue Fei because he was garrison around this area in Song Dynasty.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCrane (bird)\nCrane in Chinese mythology\nFour Great Towers of China\nPavilion of Prince Teng\nPoetry of Mao Zedong\nYueyang Tower\nWuhan\nYangtze River\nXian (Taoism)\n\n\n== References ==\n\nWan, Jingjun (Chinese: \u4e07\u7ade\u541b; pinyin: W\u00e0n J\u00ecngj\u016bn) 1982.

          "China has too many landmarks with rich history stories to tell. Yellow Crane Tower is just one of them. I find ticket is expensive & nothing much to see. It is famous simply because of the famous poet Li Bai was once here before. This place could probably take up 2hours of",
          "The reconstructed temples and pagodas were beautifully ornate and offered great views of the Qangjiang River from the upper stories. The many ceramic murals on the inside walls of the towers were stunning and worth a visit on their own",
          "Beautiful when lit up at night. We enjoyed the tour of the grounds and the tower itself. We were finishing up after hours, so it was a little tricky to figure out how to get out as it got darker. There are a lot of stairs, so be aware. There are elevators in the tower itself.",

          "This is a rebuilt tower but you can see how it changed over the different dynasties in one of the exhibitions within the tower itself. It was around 4pm when I went - the sunset was beautiful with the Yangtze River. If you are travelling free-and-easy, note that there is a gate",
          "It's an interesting place with lots of walking so be ready to do a lot of walking. I would recommend to spent almost a day in this place to check out all the places in this vast area. Be prepared to take lots of photos.",
          "Seems like this is a major tourist spot and so decided to make a visit. Basically the pagoda is quite nice and worth the visit but not really spectacular. Go to the very top for a great view and pay a small fee at the bottom to ring the ancient bell. Worth visiting if you have",
          "Is a nice place to take a relaxing walk, get away from the city and see a bit of chinese architecture. The tower is beautiful and has a nice view. My main aim was to see the lights come on and see the tower light up. However; the lights did not come on until 6pm, and as soon as",
          "The place is good to have a walk and relax from a city life, but as long as you actually have to pay for every single step in there - not fun at all. First when you get in to the park area they will propose you to get a \"bus\" ticket straight the top: in fact area is not so",
          "This was the only real 'tourist attraction' we were able to visit on our trip to Wuhan. Due to the traffic and congestion, we were confined to the Wuchang area of the city. This attraction offered a good view of the areas we did not get to visit across the river. The best",
          "This is a very hyped structure. It had a legacy, but the present structure is less than 50 year old. It does not have as much to see as one would expect in a structure inheriting the name for thousands of years.",

          "If visiting Wuhan this place is definitely not to be missed since it is the number 1 tourist attraction. Definitely a good experience to visit this place. The top view from the tower gives a nice view of the city.",
          "I had an English speaking guide to show me around this sight. It is a replica, 31 years old, that replaced previous wooden versions of the tower that had been destroyed by fire. It has 5 levels compared with the original 3. Also it has not been built in the original location due",
          "The yellow Crane Tower is of historic and cultural importance for Wuhan. It has been rebuilt several times, so is not truly as old as might be believed. The surrounding grounds are nice, but not special. The tower itself has several levels and as expected the view from each",
          "This is a hot tourist spot in Wuhan and I have been there twice. The first visit was disappointing as the tower was under renovation, but it was fine on the second visit. A truly historical piece with expansive views of the city from the top of the tower. I love the huge ceramic",
          "I was amazed by this site actually. The entrance is quite small, we can only see the tower from outside, so you expect to just visit the tower inside but in fact behind the tower you have parcs and other things to visit. On the tower the view is amazing especially when it is",
          "A beautiful place to visit, incredible view. We were there around sunset and it was amazing. Except for the smog you can see the city from there. Love it.",
          "The historical vantage point in a urban jungle. Def do the short climb and the in house garden is great place to take a walk especially in Spring and Autumn!",
          "The tower looks real good. We took the battery car from the entrance. It was way too crowded due to China national holiday, so we skipped climbing the tower. Overall, I think it's worth the visit.",
          "This is one of the most striking places in Wuhan worth every minute you stay there. I spent two hours and they were not enough to enjoy the Tower itself with splendid views - try to go there when the sun set is approaching - the huge bell which one can make 'ring', the pavilions",
          "It is worth visited this place if you are in the city. It is located close to freeway. No e city view from the top of the floor, but it isn't a modern city so it isn't pleasant view.",
          "Everyone knows of the Yellow Crane Tower. It is one of the major landmarks in Wuhan and it is pretty rubbish. The current Yellow Crane Tower was built in 1981, one kilometre away from the original site. If you are looking for something historical, look elsewhere. Another case of",

          "Located at Yangtze River it is a popular place for many poets in the Chinese history. The tower was destroyed and rebuilt many times in the history. It is really worth seeing and very crowded.",

          "Yellow Crane Tower is one of the most popular sightseeing places in Wuhan. The entrance is 80\u00a5 or more, I don't think it's worth that much. You'll see much more at East Lake.",
          "This is a great spot to visit; definitely the no.1 thing to do in Wuhan. It's a little distant from the metro stops, but it can still be walked easily from Pangxielja on Line 2. Once in the compound, there's a lot to see other than the tower itself and it will take you a couple",
          "This Yellow Crane Tower is not the original and historical one but a replica of another tower which was at a different location. Inside this tower, there are different exhibits on different floors. I like the models showing how the Yellow Crane Tower was rebuilt in different",
          "The icon of Wuhan with a rich history and beautiful peoms that I am happy to bring my friends to as they visited Wuhan. My suggestion is to start the tour from the parking lot back of the hill, passing through the gardens and pavilions and then come up to see this grand tower up",
          "Very interesting tower with great views. The only problem we faced was that the city is just shrouded with thick smog so the visibility is limited.",
          "It is a beautiful attractions for foreigners and locals. The view over Wuhan and the Yangtze river at the summit of the tower is mesmerizing.",

          "Talk about serendipity! To prep my five year old child for our China trip we watched Kung Fu Panda and Kung Fu Panda 2. Then when we were looking at photos of Wuhan online before the trip, he pointed at Yellow Crane Tower and said, \"Look daddy, it's the peacock's tower!\"",

          "Nice to be able to climb the tower and see the different exhibitions on different floors. English or any other translation not available. Good view of the Yangtze bridges and the rest of snake hill. The walk along snake hill is also very relaxing.",
          "Visited the tower for the first time many years ago, 2001 in fact. It still holds its place as a spectacularly located tourist attraction situated on the edge of the Yangtze River beside the original bridge - an engineering accomplishment in itself! Climb the tower for a",

          "This is one of the very few historical monuments in Wuhan - to be honest, it is stretching to call it \"historical\" as the whole building is built recently. On top of the building provides a good view of the Yangtze River and the city. It's not very crowded probably thanks to",

          "The ticket is expensive costing me RMB 80, but it's full of people. It is just a normal weekend and You can totally experience the Chinese culture here : crowded and unorganized. The date I went to the building, it was in renovation, I am so disappointed, especially it is",
          "We went here today. As mentioned the costs are rather high and it is not easy to find a parking spot. The place is being renovated, so that makes it much less nice. All together overrated for me.",

          "I visited the Yellow Crane Tower over the National Day holiday and it was crowded to the point of being claustrophobic. I did not go up in the actual tower because there were so many people in line, but had a decent walk around the park area. If you do go, make sure it's not",
          "Not worth the trip if you're a foreigner. Tower rebuilt in concrete 50 years the previous one was destroyed, in a different style, at a different site. Only positive point: view point on Wuhan's river.",
          "It was a good place to visit, however the tower had scaffolding when I went to visit. There are some lovely scenic views of the Yangtze River bridge and a hidden waterfall area. It is good if you want to kill an hour or 2 however isn't somewhere you could spend a whole day.",
          "Its amazing that this place was rebuild after every dynasty, from scratch. They knocked down the previous building & the new emperor re-built. The view from the top is just amazing, well worth the climb on the worn staircase. If short on time pay the $10yuan & take the golf",

          "The Yellow Crane Tower is a famour attraction in Wuhan. You will have to climb several levels to see the remarkable views of Wuhan from each floor. It is a beautiful tower and one that should not be missed on a visit to Wuhan. I would caution older visitors or those that",
          "It is quite a trek to the top of this tower, but there are things to see at each level, so I took a break and looked around at each floor on the way up. Coming down was much easier, of course. The views were breathtaking, but one thing about the tower (and most places in China),",
          "It was easy to climb up the whole mountain and stairs up to the top. The view of Changjiang River and the whole city Wuhan was amazing! And the wind up there was really cool.",

          "It is worth taking the short walk up to the pagoda. View of the city from top of the tower is magnificent. The wall painting on the first floor is worth spending some time on. On the way back, you may want to pay a small sum strike the hugh gong while getting blessings from",
          "I visited the tower 4 years ago. The entrance fee was 50 RMB but now it is 80 RMB per adult. There are not much changes to the premises. There are still the huge bell tower, the Wulou icon, white pagoda facing the tower. The tower still look imposing on top of snake hill. There",
          "One of the more impressive pagoda's I have seen during my year in China. Great views of the city from the top, assuming that it is a clean air day. Went in the late afternoon, which was nice as the place was pretty much cleared out by that time.",
          "The atmosphere in and arount the tower is very quiet. The garden is populated with rare tree species that are worth looking at. The tower istelf is well preserved and is really worth the visit, especially the frescoes in the first rooms.",

          "The place is nice, but there was too crowded. I could not even enter the tower due to the crowd. And the entrance fee is a bit high. If you are 60 years old or above, it seems that you can enter for free on certain days.",

        "wiki": "Wuhan (simplified Chinese: \u6b66\u6c49; traditional Chinese: \u6b66\u6f22, [\u00f9.x\u00e2n] (listen)) is the capital city of Hubei Province in the People's Republic of China. It is the largest city in Hubei and the most populous city in Central China, with a population of over 11 million, the ninth most populous Chinese city and one of the nine National Central Cities of China.The name \"Wuhan\" came from the city's historical origin from the conglomeration of Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang, which are collectively known as the \"Three Towns of Wuhan\" (\u6b66\u6c49\u4e09\u9547).  It lies in the eastern Jianghan Plain, at the confluence of the Yangtze river and its largest tributary, the Han River and is known as \"Nine Provinces' Thoroughfare\" (\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862).Wuhan is considered by some to be one of the potential sites of the pivotal Battle of the Red Cliffs, which stopped warlord Cao Cao's incursion into southern China at the end of the Eastern Han dynasty. Other historical events taking place in Wuhan include the Wuchang Uprising of 1911, which led to the downfall of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China. Wuhan was briefly the capital of China in 1927 under the left wing of the Kuomintang (KMT) government led by Wang Jingwei. The city later served as the wartime capital of China for ten months in 1937 during the Second Sino-Japanese War. A novel coronavirus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic was first identified in Wuhan in December 2019.Wuhan is considered the political, economic, financial, commercial, cultural and educational center of Central China. It is a major transportation hub, with dozens of railways, roads and expressways passing through the city and connecting to other major cities. Because of its key role in domestic transportation, Wuhan is sometimes referred to as \"the Chicago of China\" by foreign sources. The \"Golden Waterway\" of the Yangtze River and the Han River traverse the urban area and divide Wuhan into the three districts of Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge crosses the Yangtze in the city. The Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest power station in terms of installed capacity, is located nearby. Historically, Wuhan has suffered risks of flooding, prompting the government to alleviate the situation by introducing ecologically friendly absorption mechanisms.While Wuhan has been a traditional manufacturing hub for decades, it is also one of the areas promoting modern industrial changes in China. Wuhan consists of three national development zones, four scientific and technological development parks, over 350 research institutes, 1,656 high tech enterprises, numerous enterprise incubators and investments from 230 Fortune Global 500 firms. It produced GDP of US$22.4 billion in 2018. The Dongfeng Motor Corporation, an automobile manufacturer, is headquartered in Wuhan. The city is home to multiple notable institutes of higher education, including Wuhan University and the Huazhong University of Science and Technology. In 2017, Wuhan was designated as a Creative City by UNESCO, in the field of design. Wuhan is classified as a Beta world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Wuhan\" is a portmanteau of the two major cities on the northern and southern banks of the Yangtze River that make up the Wuhan metropolis: \"Wu\" refers to the city of Wuchang (Chinese: \u6b66\u660c), which lies on the southern bank of the Yangtze, while \"Han\" refers to the city of Hankou (Chinese: \u6c49\u53e3), which lies on the northern bank of the Yangtze.\nIn 1926, the Northern Expedition reached the Wuhan area and it was decided to merge Hankou, Wuchang and Hanyang into one city in order to make a new capital for Nationalist China. On January 1, 1927, the resulting city was proclaimed as '\u6b66\u6f22' (the traditional Chinese characters for 'Wuhan'), which was later simplified as '\u6b66\u6c49' (also 'Wuhan').\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nThe Wuhan area has been settled for 3,500 years. Panlongcheng, an archaeological site primarily associated with the Erligang culture (c. 1510 \u2013 c. 1460 BC) (being sparsely populated during the earlier Erlitou period), is located in modern-day Huangpi District.\nDuring the Western Zhou the State of E, which gives its name to the single character abbreviation for Hubei province, controlled the present-day Wuchang area south of the Yangtze River. After the conquest of the E state in 863 BC, the present-day Wuhan area was controlled by the State of Chu for the rest of the Western Zhou and Eastern Zhou periods.  Chu was in turn conquered by Qin in 223 BCE.\n\n\n=== Imperial China ===\n\nDuring the Han dynasty, Hanyang became a fairly busy port. The Battle of Xiakou in AD 203 and Battle of Jiangxia five years later were fought over control of Jiangxia Commandery (present-day Xinzhou District in northeast Wuhan). In the winter of 208/9, one of the most famous battles in Chinese history and a central event in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms\u2014the Battle of Red Cliffs\u2014took place near the Yangtze River, with the cliffs near Wuhan identified as one of the potential locations. Around that time, walls were built to protect Hanyang (AD 206) and Wuchang (AD 223). The latter event marks the foundation of Wuhan. In AD 223, the Yellow Crane Tower, one of the Four Great Towers of China, was constructed on the Wuchang side of the Yangtze River by order of Sun Quan, leader of the Eastern Wu. The tower become a sacred site of Taoism.Due to tensions between the Eastern Wu and Cao Wei kingdoms, in the autumn of 228, Cao Rui, grandson of Cao Cao and the second emperor of the state of Cao Wei, ordered the general Man Chong to lead troops to Xiakou (\u590f\u53e3; in present-day Wuhan). In 279, Wang Jun and his army conquered strategic locations in Wu territory such as Xiling (in present-day Yichang, Hubei), Xiakou (\u590f\u53e3; present-day Hankou) and Wuchang (\u6b66\u660c; present-day Ezhou, Hubei).\nDuring the Northern and Southern dynasties period, the Wuhan area was part of the successive Southern dynasty states Liu Song (420\u2013479), Southern Qi (479\u2013502), Liang, and Western Liang.\nIn fall 550, Hou Jing sent Ren Yue to attack both Xiao Daxin and Xiao Fan's son Xiao Si (\u856d\u55e3).  Ren killed Xiao Si in battle, and Xiao Daxin, unable to resist, surrendered, allowing Hou to take his domain under control.  Meanwhile, Xiao Guan, who had by now settled at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan), was planning to attack Hou, but this drew Xiao Yi's ire\u2014believing that Xiao Guan was intending to contend for the throne\u2014and he sent Wang to attack Xiao Guan. In summer 567, Chen Xu commissioned Wu Mingche as the governor of Xiang Province and had him command a major part of the troops against Hua, along with Chunyu Liang (\u6df3\u4e8e\u91cf). The opposing sides met at Zhuankou (\u6c8c\u53e3, in modern Wuhan).\nThe city has long been renowned as a center for the arts (especially poetry) and for intellectual studies. Cui Hao, a celebrated poet of the Tang dynasty, visited the Yellow Crane Tower in the early 8th century; his poem made it the most celebrated building in southern China.In spring 877, Wang Xianzhi captured E Prefecture (\u9102\u5dde, in modern Wuhan).  He then returned north, joining forces with Huang again, and they surrounded Song Wei at Song Prefecture (\u5b8b\u5dde, in modern Shangqiu, Henan).  In winter 877, Huang Chao pillaged Qi and Huang (\u9ec3\u5dde, in modern Wuhan) Prefectures.\nBefore Kublai Khan arrived in 1259, word reached him that M\u00f6ngke had died. Kublai decided to keep the death of his brother secret and continued the attack on the Wuhan area, near the Yangtze. The present-day Wuying Pagoda was constructed at the end of the Song Dynasty between attacks by the Mongolian forces.  Under the Mongol rulers (Yuan dynasty) (after 1301), the Wuchang prefecture, headquartered in the town, became the capital of Hubei province. Hankou, from the Ming to late Qing, was under the administration of the local government in Hanyang, although it was already one of the four major national markets (zh:\u56db\u5927\u540d\u9547) of the Ming dynasty.\nHanyang's Guiyuan Temple was completed in the 15th year of Shunzhi (1658).By the dawn of the 18th century, Hankou had become one of China's top four most important towns of trade. In the late 19th century, railroads were extended on a north\u2013south axis through the city, making Wuhan an important transshipment point between rail and river traffic. Also during this period foreign powers extracted mercantile concessions, with the riverfront of Hankou being divided up into foreign-controlled merchant districts. These districts contained trading firm offices, warehouses, and docking facilities. The French had a concession in Hankou. During the Taiping Rebellion, the Wuhan area was controlled for many years by rebel forces and the Yellow Crane Tower, Xingfu Temple, Zhuodaoquan Temple and other buildings were repurposed or damaged. During the Second Opium War (known in the West as the Arrow War, 1856\u20131860), the government of the Qing dynasty was defeated by the western powers and signed the Treaties of Tianjin and the Convention of Peking, which stipulated eleven cities or regions (including Hankou) as trading ports. In December 1858, James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, High Commissioner to China, led four warships up the Yangtze River in Wuhan to collect the information needed for opening the trading port in Wuhan.\nIn the spring of 1861, Counselor Harry Parkes and Admiral Herbert were sent to Wuhan to open a trading port. On the basis of the Convention of Peking, Harry Parkes concluded the Hankou Lend-Lease Treaty with Guan Wen, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei. It brought an area of 30.53 square kilometers (11.79 sq mi) along the Yangtze River (from latter-day Jianghan Road to Hezuo Road) to become a British Concession and permitted Britain to set up its consulate in the concession.\n\nIn 1889, Zhang Zhidong was transferred from Viceroy of Liangguang (Guangdong and Guangxi provinces) to Viceroy of Huguang (Hunan and Hubei provinces). He governed the province for 18 years, until 1907. During this period, he elucidated the theory of \"Chinese learning as the basis, Western learning for application,\" known as the ti-yong ideal. He set up many heavy industries, founded Hanyang Steel Plant, Daye Iron Mine, Pingxiang Coal Mine and Hubei Arsenal and set up local textile industries, boosting the flourishing modern industry in Wuhan. Meanwhile, he initiated education reform, opened dozens of modern educational organizations successively, such as Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) Academy of Classical Learning, Civil General Institute, Military General Institute, Foreign Languages Institute and Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) General Normal School, and selected a great many students for study overseas, which well promoted the development of China's modern education. Furthermore, he trained a modern military and organized a modern army including a zhen and a xie (both zhen and xie are military units in the Qing dynasty) in Hubei.\nOriginally known as the Hubei Arsenal, the Hanyang Arsenal was founded in 1891 by Qing official Zhang Zhidong, who diverted funds from the Nanyang Fleet in Guangdong to build the arsenal. It cost about 250,000 pounds sterling and was built in 4 years. On 23 April 1894, construction was completed and the arsenal, occupying some 40 acres (160,000 m2), could start production of small-caliber cannons. It built magazine-fed rifles, Gruson quick fire guns, and cartridges.\n\n\n==== Wuchang Uprising ====\n\nBy 1900, according to Collier's magazine, Hankau, the Yangtze River boom town, was \"the St. Louis and Chicago of China.\" On October 10, 1911, Sun Yat-sen's followers launched the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the collapse of the Qing dynasty, as well as the establishment of the Chinese Republic.The Wuchang Uprising of October 1911, which overthrew the Qing dynasty, originated in Wuhan. Before the uprising, anti-Qing secret societies were active in Wuhan. In September 1911, the outbreak of the protests in Sichuan forced the Qing authorities to send part of the New Army garrisoned in Wuhan to suppress the rebellion. On September 14 the Literary Society (\u6587\u5b78\u793e) and the Progressive Association (\u5171\u9032\u6703), two local revolutionary organizations in Hubei, set up joint headquarters in Wuchang and planned for an uprising. On the morning of October 9, a bomb at the office of the political arrangement exploded prematurely and alerted local authorities. The proclamation for the uprising, beadroll and the revolutionaries\u2019 official seal fell into the hands of Rui Cheng, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei, who demolished the uprising headquarters the same day and set out to arrest the revolutionaries listed in the beadroll. This forced the revolutionaries to launch the uprising earlier than planned.On the night of October 10, the revolutionaries fired shots to signal the uprising at the engineering barracks of Hubei New Army. They then led the New Army of all barracks to join the revolution. Under the guidance of Wu Zhaolin, Cai Jimin and others, this revolutionary army seized the official residence of the governor and government offices. Rui Cheng fled in panic into the Chuyu ship. Zhang Biao, the commander of the Qing army, also fled the city. On the morning of the 11th, the revolutionary army took the whole city of Wuchang, but leaders such as Jiang Yiwu and Sun Wu disappeared. Thus the leaderless revolutionary army recommended Li Yuanhong, the assistant governor of the Qing army, as the commander-in-chief. Li founded the Hubei Military Government, proclaimed the abolition of the Qing rule in Hubei, the founding of the Republic of China and published an open telegram calling for other provinces to join the revolution.As the revolution spread to other parts of the country, the Qing government concentrated loyalist military forces to suppress the uprising in Wuhan. From October 17 to December 1, the revolutionary army and local volunteers defended the city in the Battle of Yangxia against better armed and more numerous Qing forces commanded by Yuan Shikai. Huang Xing would arrive in Wuhan in early November to take command of the revolutionary army. After fierce fighting and heavy casualties, Qing forces seized Hankou and Hanyang. But Yuan agreed to halt the advance on Wuchang and participated in peace talks, which would eventually lead to the return of Sun Yat-sen from exile, founding of the Republic of China on January 1, 1912. Through the Wuchang Uprising, Wuhan is known as the birthplace of the Xinhai Revolution, named after the Xinhai year on the Chinese calendar. The city has several museums and memorials to the revolution and the thousands of martyrs who died defending the revolution.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\n\nWith the northern extension of the Northern Expedition, the center of the Great Revolution shifted from the Pearl River basin to the Yangtze River basin. On November 26, the Kuomintang Central Political Committee decided to move the capital from Guangzhou to Wuhan. In mid-December, most of the KMT central executive commissioners and national government commissioners arrived in Wuhan, set up the temporary joint conference of central executive commissioners and National Government commissioners, performed the top functions of central party headquarters and National Government, declared they would work in Wuhan on January 1, 1927, and decided to combine the towns of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang into Wuhan City, called \"Capital District\". The new national government, later known as \"Wuhan nationalist government\", was based in the Nanyang Building in Hankou, while the central party headquarters and other organizations chose their locations in Hankou or Wuchang.In March 1927, Mao Zedong appeared at the Third Plenum of the KMT Central Executive Committee in Wuhan, which sought to strip General Chiang of his power by appointing Wang Jingwei leader. The first phase of the Northern Expedition was interrupted by the political split in the Kuomintang following the formation of the Nanjing faction in April 1927 against the existing faction in Wuhan. Members of the Chinese Communist Party, who had survived the April 12 massacre, met at Wuhan and reelected Chen Duxiu (Ch'en Tu-hsiu) as the Party's Secretary General. The split was partially motivated by the purge of the Communists within the party, which marked the end of the First United Front, and Chiang Kai-shek briefly stepped down as the commander of the National Revolutionary Army.In June 1927, Stalin sent a telegram to the Communists in Wuhan, calling for the mobilization of an army of workers and peasants. This alarmed Wang Jingwei, who decided to break with the Communists and come to terms with Chiang Kai-shek. The Wuhan coup was a political shift made on July 15, 1927, by Wang Jingwei towards Chiang Kai-shek, and his Shanghai-based rival in the Kuomintang. The Wuhan Nationalist Government was established in Wuhan on February 21, 1927, and ended by August 19, 1927. After the end of the Northern Expedition, Hankou was elevated to a centrally-controlled municipality.\n\nIn the 1931 China floods, one of the deadliest flood disasters in world history, Wuhan was a refuge for flood victims from outlying areas, who had been arriving since the late spring. But when the city itself was inundated in the early summer, and after a catastrophic dike failure just before 6:00 AM on July 27, an estimated 782,189 urban citizens and rural refugees were left homeless. The flood covered an area of 32 square miles and the city was flooded under many feet of water for close to three months. Large numbers gathered on flood islands throughout the city, with 30,000 sheltering on a railway embankment in central Hankou. With little food and a complete breakdown in sanitation, thousands soon began to succumb to diseases. Jin Shilong, Senior Engineer at the Hubei Flood Prevention Agency, described the flooding:There was no warning, only a sudden great wall of water. Most of Wuhan's buildings in those days were only one story high, and for many people there was no escape- they died by the tens of thousands. ... I was just coming off duty at the company's main office, a fairly new three-story building near the center of town ... When I heard the terrible noise and saw the wall of water coming, I raced to the top story of the building. ... I was in one of the tallest and strongest buildings left standing. At that time no one knew whether the water would subside or rise even higher.The high-water mark was reached on 19 August at Hankou, with the water level exceeding 16 m (53 ft) above normal. In 1936, when natural disaster struck Central China with widespread flooding affecting Hebei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Wuhan and Chongqing caused by the Yangtze and Huai Rivers bursting their banks, Ong Seok Kim, as Chairman of the Sitiawan Fundraising and Disaster Relief Committee, raised money and materials in support of the victims.\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War and following the fall of Nanking in December 1937, Wuhan had become the provisional capital of China's Kuomintang government, and became another focal point of pitched air battles beginning in early 1938 between modern monoplane bomber and fighter aircraft of the Imperial Japanese forces and the Chinese Air Force, which included support from the Soviet Volunteer Group in both planes and personnel, as U.S. support in war materials waned. As the battle raged on through 1938, Wuhan and the surrounding region had become the site of the Battle of Wuhan. After being taken by the Japanese in late 1938, Wuhan became a major Japanese logistics center for operations in southern China.\n\nIn early October 1938, Japanese troops moved east and north in the outskirts of Wuhan. As a result, numerous companies and enterprises and large numbers of people had to withdraw from Wuhan to the west of Hubei and Sichuan. The KMT navy undertook the responsibility of defending the Yangtze River on patrol and covering the withdrawal. On October 24, while overseeing the waters of the Yangtze River near the town of Jinkou (Jiangxia District in Wuhan) in Wuchang, the KMT gunboat Zhongshan came up against six Japanese aircraft. Though two were eventually shot down, the Zhongshan sank with 25 casualties. Raised from the bottom of the Yangtze River in 1997, and restored at a local shipyard, the Zhongshan has been moved to a purpose-built museum in Wuhan's suburban Jiangxia District, which opened on September 26, 2011.As a key center on the Yangtze, Wuhan was an important base for Japanese operations in China. On 18 December 1944, Wuhan was bombed by 77 American bombers that set off a firestorm that destroyed much of the city. For the next three days, Wuhan was bombed by the Americans, destroying all of the docks and warehouses of Wuhan, as well as the Japanese air bases in the city. The air raids killed thousands of Chinese civilians which American bombers did not know. \"According to casualty statistics compiled by Hankou city in 1946, more than 20,000 were killed or injured in the December bombings of 1944.\"Wuhan returned to Chinese control in September 1945. Administratively, Wuchang and Hanyang were initially combined into a new City of Wuchang, but in October 1946 were separated into the City of Wuchang (including Wuchang only) and the County of Hanyang. Hankou became a centrally controlled municipality in August 1947. Militarily, the Wuhan Forward Headquarters was established in Wuhan, headed by Bai Chongxi.\n\nDuring the later stages of the Chinese Civil War, Bai sought to broker peace, proposing that the Communist Party could rule northern China while the Nationalist government retained southern China. This was rejected, and on 15 May 1949 Bai and the Wuhan garrison retreated from the city. People's Liberation Army troops entered Wuhan on the afternoon of Monday, May 16, 1949.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n\nThe Changjiang Water Resources Commission was reestablished in February 1950 with its headquarters in Wuhan. From June to September 1954, the Yangtze River Floods were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to an unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. In 1969, a large stone monument was erected in the riverside park in Hankou honoring the heroic deeds in fighting the 1954 Yangtze River floods.\nBefore construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, Hunslet Engine Company built two extra heavy 0-8-0 locomotives for loading the train ferries for crossing the Yangtze River in Wuhan.\nThe project of building the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also known as the First Yangtze River Bridge, was regarded as one of the key projects during the first five-year plan. On October 25, 1955, construction began on the bridge proper. The same day in 1957, the whole project was completed and an opening-to-traffic ceremony was held on October 15. The First Yangtze River Bridge united the Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway with the Guangdong\u2013Hankou Railway into the Beijing\u2013Guangzhou Railway, making Wuhan a 'thoroughfare to nine provinces' (\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862) in name and in fact.\nAfter Chengdu Conference, Mao went to Chongqing and Wuhan in April to inspect the countryside and factories. In Wuhan, he called all the leaders of provinces and municipalities who had not attended Chengdu Conference to report their work. Tian Jiaying, the secretary of Mao, said that Wuhan Conference was a supplement to Chengdu Conference.In July 1967, civil strife struck the city in the Wuhan Incident (\"July 20th Incident\"), an armed conflict between two hostile groups who were fighting for control over the city at the height of the Cultural Revolution.In 1981, the Wuhan City Government commenced reconstruction of the Yellow Crane Tower at a new location, about 1 km (0.62 mi) from the original site, and it was completed in 1985. In 1957, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was built with one trestle of the bridge on the site of the tower, which had been last destroyed in 1884.During the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, students in Wuhan blocked the Yangtze River Railway bridge and another 4,000 gathered at the railway station. About one thousand students staged a railroad 'sit-in'. Rail traffic on the Beijing-Guangzhou and Wuhan-Dalian lines was interrupted. The students also urged employees of major state-owned enterprises to go on strike. The situation was so tense that residents reportedly began a bank run and resorted to panic-buying.\n\nIn the wake of the United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade on May 7, 1999, protests broke out throughout China, including in Wuhan.On June 22, 2000, a Wuhan Airlines flight from Enshi to Wuhan was forced to circle for 30 minutes due to thunderstorms. The aircraft eventually crashed on the banks of Han River in Hanyang District, all on-board perished (there were varying accounts of number of crews and passengers). In addition, the crash also killed 7 people on the ground.Chinese protesters organized boycotts of the French-owned retail chain Carrefour in major Chinese cities including Kunming, Hefei and Wuhan, accusing the French nation of pro-secessionist conspiracy and anti-Chinese racism. The BBC reported that hundreds of people demonstrated in Beijing, Wuhan, Hefei, Kunming and Qingdao. On May 19, 2011, Fang Binxing, the Principal of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (also known as \"Father of China's Great Fire Wall\") was hit on the chest by a shoe thrown at him by a Huazhong University of Science and Technology student who calls herself \"hanjunyi\" (\u5bd2\u541b\u4f9d, or \u5c0f\u6e56\u5317) while Fang was giving a lecture at Wuhan University.The city has been subject to devastating floods, which are now supposed to be controlled by the ambitious Three Gorges Dam, a project which was completed in 2008. The 2008 Chinese winter storms damaged water supply equipment in Wuhan: up to 100,000 people were out of running water when several water pipes burst, cutting the supply to local households. The 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat wave hit Wuhan on July 3.\nIn the 2010 China floods, the Han River at Wuhan experienced its worst flooding in twenty years, as officials continued sandbagging efforts along the Han and Yangtze Rivers in the city and checked reservoirs. In the 2011 China floods, Wuhan was flooded, with parts of the city losing power. In the 2016 China floods, Wuhan saw 570 mm (22 in) of rainfall during the first week of July, surpassing the record that fell on the city in 1991. A red alert for heavy rainfall was issued on 2 July, the same day that eight people died after a 15-meter (49 ft) section of a 2 m (6.6 ft) tall wall collapsed on top of them. The city's subway system, the Wuhan Metro was partially submerged as was the main railway station. At least 14 city residents were killed, one was missing, and more than 80,000 were relocated.In early July 2019, there were protests against plans for a new incinerator in Xinzhou District.The 2019 Military World Games were hosted in Wuhan in October.\nIn December 2019, an epidemic of a new coronavirus disease began in Wuhan. The disease, which became known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), spread and developed into the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Wuhan and other Hubei cities were placed under lockdown for nearly three months to contain the disease. On April 8, 2020, the Wuhan lockdown officially came to an end after no new domestic cases were reported in Hubei province.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Overview ===\n\nWuhan is in east-central Hubei, at latitude 29\u00b0 58'\u201331\u00b0 22' N and longitude 113\u00b0 41'\u2013115\u00b0 05' E. Wuhan sits at the confluence of the Han River flowing into the Yangtze River at the East of the Jianghan Plain along the Yangtze's middle reaches.\nThe metropolitan area comprises three parts\u2014Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang\u2014commonly called the \"Three Towns of Wuhan\" (hence the name \"Wuhan\", combining \"Wu\" from the first city and \"Han\" from the other two). The consolidation of these cities occurred in 1927 and Wuhan was thereby established. The three former cities face each other across the rivers and are linked by bridges, including one of the first modern bridges in China, known as the \"First Bridge\".\n\nWuchang lies South East of the Yangtze River that separates it from both Hankou and Hanyang.\nHankou sits North of the Yangtze River separating it from Wuchang. Hankou is North of the Han River separating it from Hanyang.\nHanyang lies West of the Yangtze separating it from Wuchang. Hanyang is south of the Han river separating it from Hankou.\nIt is simple in terrain \u2014 low and flat in the middle and hilly in the south, with the Yangtze and Han rivers winding through the city. The She River enters the Yangtze in Huangpi District. Wuhan occupies a land area of 8,494.41 square kilometers (3,279.71 sq mi), most of which is alluvial plain and decorated with hills and a great number of lakes and ponds. Water makes up one quarter of Wuhan's urban territory, which is the highest percentage among  major cities in China. Wuhan has nearly 200 lakes, including the East Lake of 33 km2, and Tangxun Lake, which are the largest lakes entirely within a city in China.Other well-known lakes include South Lake and Sand Lake. Liangzi Lake, the largest lake by surface area in Hubei province, is located in the southeast of Jiangxia District. At 709 m (2,326 ft) above sea level, the highest point in Wuhan is the main peak of Yunwu Mountain (\u4e91\u96fe\u5c71) in northwestern Huangpi District. There are also several mountains within the city limits of Wuhan including Mount Luojia (\u73de\u73c8\u5c71) in Wuchang District as well as Mount Hong (\u6d2a\u5c71) and Mount Yujia (\u55bb\u5bb6\u5c71/\u745c\u73c8\u5c71) in Hongshan District.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nWuhan's climate is humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) with abundant rainfall in summer and four distinctive seasons. Wuhan is known for its humid summers, when dewpoints can often reach 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) or more. Historically, along with Chongqing and Nanjing, Wuhan is referred to as one of the \"Three Furnacelike Cities\" along the Yangtze River for their hot summers. However, the climate data of recent years suggests that Wuhan is no longer among the top tier of \"The hottest cities in summer\" list, the New Four Furnacelike Cities are Chongqing, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, and Nanchang. Spring and autumn are generally mild, while winter is cool with quite low rainfall and occasional snow. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from 4.0 \u00b0C (39.2 \u00b0F) in January to 29.1 \u00b0C (84.4 \u00b0F) in July. Annual precipitation totals just under 1,320 mm (52 in), the majority of which falls from April to July; the annual mean temperature is 17.13 \u00b0C (62.8 \u00b0F), the frost-free period lasts 211 to 272 days. With monthly possible sunshine percentage ranging from 31 percent in March to 59 percent in August, the city proper receives 1,865 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extreme low and high temperatures recorded are \u221218.1 \u00b0C (\u22121 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1977 and 39.7 \u00b0C (103 \u00b0F) on 27 July 2017 (unofficial record of 41.3 \u00b0C (106 \u00b0F) in 1934).\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nWuhan is a sub-provincial city. Municipal government is regulated by the local Communist Party of China (CPC), led by the Wuhan CPC Secretary (Chinese: \u6b66\u6c49\u5e02\u59d4\u4e66\u8bb0), Wang Zhonglin (\u738b\u5fe0\u6797). The local CPC issues administrative orders, collects taxes, manages the economy, and directs a standing committee of the Municipal People's Congress in making policy decisions and overseeing the local government.\nGovernment officials include the mayor (\u5e02\u957f), Zhou Xianwang (\u5468\u5148\u65fa), and vice-mayors.

Since 2004 it has been a focal point of the Rise of Central China Plan, which aims to build less-developed inland economies into hubs of advanced manufacturing.\nSince 1890, the steel industry has been the backbone of Wuhan's industry. In 2010, automobile industry exceeded GDP for Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO) steel for the first time. There are 5 car manufacturers, including Dongfeng Honda, Citroen, Shanghai GM, DFM Passenger Vehicle and Dongfeng Renault. Dongfeng-Citroen Automobile Co., Ltd is headquartered in the city.As of 2016, Wuhan has attracted foreign investment from over 80 countries, with 5,973 foreign-invested enterprises established in the city with a total capital injection of $22.45 billion USD. Among these, about 50 French companies including Renault and PSA Group have operations in the city, representing over one third of French investment in China, and the highest level of French investment in any Chinese city.Wuhan is an important center for economy, trade, finance, transportation, information technology, and education in China. Its major industries include optic-electronic, automobile manufacturing, iron and steel manufacturing, new pharmaceutical sector, biology engineering, new materials industry and environmental protection.  Environmental sustainability is highlighted in Wuhan's list of emerging industries, which include energy efficiency technology and renewable energy.\n\n\n=== Industrial zones ===\nMajor industrial zones in Wuhan include in chronological order:\n\nWuhan Economic and Technological Development ZoneWuhan Economic and Technological Development Zone is a national level industrial zone incorporated in 1993. Its current zone size is about 10\u201325 square km and it plans to expand to 25\u201350 square km. Industries encouraged in Wuhan Economic and Technological Development Zone include Auto-mobile Production/Assembly, Biotechnology/Pharmaceuticals, Chemicals Production and Processing, Food/Beverage Processing, Heavy Industry, and Telecommunications Equipment.\n\nWuhan Export Processing ZoneWuhan Export Processing Zone was established in 2000. It is located in Wuhan Economic and Technology Development Zone, planned to cover 2.7 square kilometers (1.0 square mile) of land. The first 0.7-square-kilometer (0.3-square-mile) area has already been created.\nWuhan Donghu New Technology Development ZoneWuhan Donghu New Technology Development Zone is a national level high-tech development zone. Optical-electronics, telecommunications, and equipment manufacturing are the core industries of Wuhan East Lake High-Tech Development Zone (ELHTZ) while software outsourcing and electronics are also encouraged. ELHTZ is China's largest production center for optoelectronic products with key players like Yangtze Optical Fiber and Cable, (the largest fiber-optical cable maker in China), and Fiberhome Telecommunications. Wuhan Donghu New Technology Development Zone also represents the development center for China's laser industry with key players such as HG Tech and Chutian Laser being based in the zone.\nWuhan Optical Valley (Guanggu) Software ParkWuhan Optical Valley (Guanggu) Software Park is located in Wuhan Donghu New Technology Development Zone. Wuhan Optics Valley Software Park is jointly developed by East Lake High-Tech Development Zone and Dalian Software Park Co., Ltd. The planned area is 0.67 square kilometers (0.26 square miles) with total floor area of 6,000,000 square meters (65,000,000 square feet). The zone is 8.5 km (5.28 mi) away from the 316 National Highway and is 46.7 km (29.02 mi) away from the Wuhan Tianhe Airport.\n\nWuhan BiolakeBiolake is an industrial base established in 2008 in the Optics Valley of China. Located in East Lake New Technology Development Zone of Wuhan, Biolake covers 15 km2 (5.8 sq mi), and has six parks including Bio-innovation Park, Bio-pharma Park, Bio-agriculture Park, Bio-manufacturing Park, Medical Device Park and Medical Health Park, to accommodate both research activities and living.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nWuhan is the most populous city in Central China and among the most populous in China.  In the Sixth Census of China in 2010, Wuhan's built-up area made of 8 out of 10 urban districts (all but Xinzhou and Hannan not yet conurbated) was home to 8,821,658 inhabitants. As of 2015, the city of Wuhan had an estimated population of 10,607,700 people.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 19 million.\nAs of November 2019, urban development status considering both spatial and socioeconomic processes has been examined using Night Time Lighting data and land cover data as proxies; it showed Wuhan's high concentration\nof socioeconomic activities compared to its urban spatial development.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nAccording to a survey published in 2017, 79.2% of the population of Wuhan are either irreligious or practice worship of gods and ancestors; among these 0.9% are Taoists. Among other religious doctrines, 14.7% of the population adheres to Buddhism, 2.9% to Protestantism, 0.3% to Catholicism and 1.6% to Islam, and 1.6% of the population adheres to unspecified other religions.\nReligious sites in Wuhan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nChina Railway Wuhan Group manages the Wuhan Railway Hub. Wuhan Railway Hub is considered one of the four key railway hubs of China. The city of Wuhan is served by three major railway stations: the Hankou Railway Station in Hankou, the Wuchang Railway Station in Wuchang, and the Wuhan Railway Station, located in a newly developed area east of the East Lake (Hongshan District). As the stations are many miles apart, it is important for passengers to be aware of the particular station(s) used by a particular train.\nThe (original) Hankou Station was the terminus for the Jinghan Railway from Beijing, while the Wuchang Station was the terminus for the Yuehan Railway to Guangzhou. Since the construction of the First Yangtze Bridge and the linking of the two lines into the Jingguang Railway, both Hankou and Wuchang stations have been served by trains going to all directions, which contrasts with the situation in such cities as New York or Moscow, where different stations serve different directions.\nWith the opening of the Hefei-Wuhan high-speed railway on April 1, 2009, Wuhan became served by high-speed trains with Hefei, Nanjing, and Shanghai; several trains a day now connect the city with Shanghai, getting there in under 6 hours. As of early 2010, most of these express trains leave from the Hankou Railway Station.\n\nIn 2006, construction began on the new Wuhan Railway Station with 11 platforms, located on the northeastern outskirts of the city. In December 2009, the station was opened, as China unveiled its second high-speed train with scheduled runs from Guangzhou to Wuhan. Billed as the fastest train in the world, it can reach a speed of 394 km/h (244.82 mph). The travel time between the two cities has been reduced from ten and a half hours to just three. The rail service has been extended north to Beijing.As of 2011, the new Wuhan Railway Station is primarily used by the Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed trains, while most regular trains to other destinations continue to use the Hankou and Wuchang stations.\n\nConstruction work is carried out on several lines of the new Wuhan Metropolitan Area Intercity Railway, which will eventually connect Wuhan's three main rail terminals with several stations throughout the city's outer areas and farther suburbs, as well as with the nearby cities of Xianning, Huangshi, Huanggang, and Xiaogan. The first line of the system, the one to Xianning, opened for passenger operations at the end of 2013. The line to Xiaogen opened on 1 December 2016 and it was extended with the opening of the Wuhan\u2013Shiyan high-speed railway to Shiyan on 29 November 2019.The main freight railway station and classification yard of the Wuhan metropolitan area is the extensive Wuhan North railway station, with 112 tracks and over 650 switches. It is located in Hengdian Subdistrict of Huangpi District, located 20 km (12 mi) north of the Wuhan Station and 23 km (14 mi) from Hankou Station.\n\n\n=== Wuhan Metro ===\n\nWuhan Metro is a rapid transit system serving the city of Wuhan. Owned and operated by Wuhan Metro Group Co., Ltd., the network now includes 9 lines, 228 stations, and 339 km (211 mi) of route length. Line 1, the first line in the system, opened on 28 July 2004, which made Wuhan became the seventh city in mainland China with rapid transit system, after Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Changchun, and Dalian. Line 2 opened on 28 December 2012 and is the first underground metro line crossing the Yangtze River. With 1.22 billion annual passengers in 2019, Wuhan Metro is the sixth-busiest rapid transit system in mainland China. There are a number of lines or sections under construction. The government of Wuhan City promised the citizens that at least two lines or sections open every year. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire network was out of service from 23 January to 27 March 2020.\n\n\n=== Trams ===\n\nTrams were brought to the streets of Wuhan on July 28, 2017 with the first line (Auto-city T1 Line) opened that day. The trams under construction or planning in Wuhan are:\n\nAuto-city trams, with Lines T1, T2, T6, and T8 in the Wuhan Economic Development Area, in the far western reaches on Hanyang. T1 Line is operational as of 2017.\nOptics Valley trams, two lines  (T1 and T2) south and east of Guanggu Circle (Guanggu Guangchang) in southeastern Wuchang. The system opened on January 18, 2018.\nThe Old Hankou Streetcar, a loop line around Hankou city.\n\n\n=== Maritime transport ===\nWuhan is a major hub for maritime transport in central China. The Port of Wuhan provide services for the local population and shipping services.\n\n\n=== Ferry ===\nAs a city located at bank of Yangtze River, Wuhan has long history of ferry services. Modern ferry services were established in 1900 by steam boat. In 1937, a train ferry was established to transport train cars from Hankou to Wuchang. There are numbered stops around Wuhan where people can get on and off the ferry and there is a tourist ferry in the night.\nCurrently, ferry services are provided by the Wuhan Ferry Company. In 2010, the company bought 10 new ships to replace the ones that had been in service for 29 years.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nOpened in April 1995 to substitute for the old Hankou Wangjiadun Airport and Nanhu Airport as the major airport of Wuhan, Wuhan Tianhe International Airport is one of the busiest airports in central China. It is located in Wuhan's suburban Huangpi District 26 kilometers (16 mi) north of Wuhan city proper. The extension of Line 2 of Wuhan Metro to Tianhe Airport opened on 28 December 2016. It has also been selected as China's fourth international hub airport after Beijing Capital International Airport, Shanghai-Pudong and Guangzhou Baiyun. A second terminal was completed in March 2008, having been started in February 2005 with an investment of CNY 3.372 billion. International flights to neighboring Asian countries have also been enhanced, including direct flights to Tokyo and Nagoya, Japan. Terminal 3 has been available for service since early 2017.\nHannan Municipal Airport is an municipal airport that serves Hannan District. It is the biggest airport in China that only handles general aviation, and the biggest municipal airport in Hubei Province. Caidian Municipal Airport is an under-construction airport which will serve Caidian District. The airport began construction on 1 December 2017.\n\n\n=== Highways and expressways ===\nNumerous major highways and expressways pass through Wuhan, including:\n\nChina National Highway 107\nChina National Highway 316\nChina National Highway 318\nG42 Shanghai\u2013Chengdu Expressway\nG0422 Wuhan\u2013Shenzhen Expressway\n\n\n=== Bicycle-sharing system ===\nAs of May 2011, the Wuhan and Hangzhou Public Bicycle bike-share systems in China were the largest in the world, with around 90,000 and 60,000 bicycles respectively. In 2012 the Wuhan and Hangzhou Public Bicycle programs in China are the largest in the world, with around 90,000 and 60,000 bicycles respectively. China has seen a rise in private \"dockless\" bike shares with fleets that dwarf systems in size outside China. Initially, a number of traditional (third generation) docked public bike systems operated by local municipal governments opened across China, with the largest ones being in Wuhan and Hangzhou.  The first was introduced in Beijing in 2007.  However, third generation bike sharing is not considered successful for the majority cities in China.  Bike sharing in Beijing virtually stopped and it also has encountered difficulties in Shanghai and Wuhan.\n\n\n== Destinations ==\n\nThe Yellow Crane Tower (Huanghelou) is presumed to have been first built in approximately 220 AD. The tower has been destroyed and reconstructed numerous times, and was burned last according to some sources in 1884. The tower underwent complete reconstruction in 1981. The reconstruction utilized modern materials and added an elevator while maintaining the traditional design in the tower's outward appearance.\nWuchang has the largest and second largest lakes within a city in China, the East Lake and Tangxun Lake, as well as the South Lake. East Lake in Wuhan is six times the size of the West Lake in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province. The total area is more than 80 km2 (31 sq mi) of which the lake is covering an area of 33 km2 (13 sq mi). In the springtime, the shores of East Lake become a garden of flowers with the Mei blossoms as the king and the Cherry Blossom as the queen among the species at East Lake Cherry Blossom Park. Another famous flower is the lotus. The lake has a long history and especially the Chu Kingdom is well represented around East Lake. Moreover, in the Moshan Botanic Garden there are many types of plum blossoms, as well as lotus flowers.\nThe Hubei Provincial Museum: With over 200,000 valued artifacts, this is one of the leading museums in China.

With a history of more than 2,000 years, Hubei cuisine, originating in ancient Chu cuisine, has developed a number of distinctive dishes, such as steamed blunt-snout bream in clear soup, preserved ham with flowering Chinese cabbage, and others. On the third day of the third month of the lunar calendar, many in Wuhan eat d\u00ecc\u00e0i zh\u01d4 j\u012bd\u00e0n (\u5730\u83dc\u716e\u9e21\u86cb), an egg dish which is supposed to prevent illness in the coming year.\"No need to be particular about the recipes; all foods have their own uses. Rice wine and tangyuan are excellent midnight snacks, while fat bream and flowering Chinese cabbages are great delicacies.\" This attitude expressed in Hankou Zhuzhici reflects indirectly the eating habits and a wide variety of distinctive snacks with a long history in Wuhan, such as Qingshuizong (a pyramid-shaped dumpling made of glutinous rice wrapped in bamboo or reed leaves) in the Period of the Warring States, Chunbinbian in Northern and Southern dynasties, mung bean jelly in the Sui dynasty, youguo (a deep-fried twisted dough stick) in the Song and Yuan dynasties, rice wine and mianwo in the Ming and Qing dynasties, as well as three-delicacy stuffed skin of bean milk, tangbao (steamed dumpling filled with minced meat and gravy) and hot braised noodles (reganmian) in modern times.\nGuozao (\u904e\u65e9) is a popular way to say 'having breakfast' in Wuhan, and a part of the city's culture. As a hub for land transport in China, Wuhan has gathered and mixed together various habits and customs from neighboring cities and provinces in all directions, which gives rise to a concentration of diverse cuisines from different places. The most famous place to guozao (have breakfast) is Hubu Street (\u6236\u90e8\u5df7), a 150-meter-long street in the neighborhood of Simenkou (\u53f8\u95e8\u53e3). Along its short length one can find nearly all the traditional foods of Wuhan, such as:\n\nHot and dry noodles, re-gan mian (\u70ed\u5e72\u9762), consists of long freshly boiled noodles mixed with sesame paste. It is considered to be the most typical local food for breakfast.\nDuck's neck or Ya Bozi (\u9e2d\u8116\u5b50) is a local version of this popular Chinese dish, made of duck necks and spices.\nBean skin or doupi (\u8c46\u76ae) is a local dish with a filling of egg, rice, beef, mushrooms and beans cooked between two large round soybean skins and cut into pieces, structurally like a stuffed pizza without enclosing edges.\nSoup dumpling or xiaolongtangbao (\u5c0f\u7b3c\u6c64\u5305) is a kind of dumpling with thin skin made of flour, steamed with very juicy meat inside, hence the name: tang (soup) bao (bun) \u2013 every time one takes a bite from it the \"soup\" inside is liable to spill out.\nA salty doughnut or mianwo (\u9eaa\u7aa9) is a kind of savory donut with a salty taste. It is much thinner than a common donut and is a typical Wuhan local food.\n\n\n=== Opera ===\nHan opera, which is the local opera of Wuhan area, was one of China's oldest and most popular operas. During the late Qing dynasty, Han opera, blended with Hui opera, gave birth to Peking opera, the most popular opera in modern China. Thus Han opera has been called the \"mother of Peking opera.\"\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nWuhan has a professional football team, Wuhan Zall F.C., that plays in the Chinese Super League. Xinhua Road Sport Center, the team's home stadium, with a capacity of 32,137, is located in the heart of the city next to Zhongshan Park. For the 2013 season, Wuhan Zall was promoted to the top-tier league of Chinese football, Chinese Super League, and relocated its home to Wuhan Sports Center Stadium, a modern stadium with 54,357 seats located in the suburbs of the city. However, the team did not play well in the ensuing season and was demoted back to China League One as the 2013 season ended. For financial and transportation reasons, the team moved back to Xinhua Road Sport Center in 2014.\nThe Wuhan Gators are a professional arena football team based in Wuhan. They are members of the China Arena Football League (CAFL).The 13,000-seat Wuhan Gymnasium held the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship and was one of the venues for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup. The 7th Military World Games were hosted in Wuhan from Oct. 18 to 27, 2019.The city has been the venue for the women's tennis tournament, the Wuhan Open, one of the WTA's Premier 5 tournaments, since 2014.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Bridges ===\n\nWuhan has eleven bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze River. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also called the First Bridge, was built over the Yangtze in 1957, carrying a railroad directly across the river between hills known as Snake Hill and Turtle Hill. Before this bridge was built it could take up to an entire day to barge railcars across. Including its approaches, it is 5,511 feet (1,680 m) long, and it accommodates both a double-track railway on a lower deck and a four-lane roadway above. It was built with the assistance of advisers from the Soviet Union.\nThe Second Bridge, a cable-stayed bridge built of prestressed concrete, has a central span of 400 meters (1,300 feet); it is 4,678 meters (15,348 feet) in length (including 1,877 meters (6,158 feet) of the main bridge) and 26.5 to 33.5 meters (86.9 to 109.9 feet) in width. Its main bridgeheads are 90 meters (300 feet) high each, pulling 392 thick slanting cables together in the shape of double fans so that the central span of the bridge is well poised on the piers and the bridge's stability and vibration resistance are ensured. With six lanes on the deck, the bridge is designed to handle the daily passage of 50,000 motor vehicles. The bridge was completed in 1995.\n\nThe Third Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also called Baishazhou Bridge, was completed in September 2000. Located 8.6 kilometers (5.3 miles) southwest of the First Bridge, construction of Baishazhou Bridge started in 1997. With an investment of over 1.4 billion yuan (about US$170,000,000), the bridge, which is 3,586 meters (11,765 feet) long and 26.5 meters (86.9 feet) wide, has six lanes and has a capacity of 50,000 vehicles a day. The bridge is expected to serve as a major passage for the future Wuhan Ring Road, greatly easing the city's traffic and aiding local economic development.\nThe Yangluo Bridge carries Wuhan's Ring Road across the Yangtze in the city's eastern suburbs (connecting the Hongshan District with the Xinzhou District). It was opened on December 26, 2007.\nThe Wuhan Tianxingzhou Yangtze River Bridge crosses the Yangtze in the northeastern part of the city, downstream of the Second bridge. It is named after Tianxing Island (Tianxingzhou), above which it crosses the river. Built at a cost of 11 billion yuan, the 4,657-meter cable suspension bridge was opened on December 26, 2009, in time for the opening of the Wuhan Railway Station. It is a combined road and rail bridge, and carries the Wuhan\u2013Guangzhou High-Speed Railway across the river.\n\n\n=== Skyscrapers ===\n\nThe Yellow Crane Tower, historically one of the tallest buildings in Wuhan, is considered one of the Four Great Towers of China and was destroyed twelve times, both by warfare and by fire. The tower is classified as an AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration. At 438 meters (1,437 ft) in height, the Wuhan Center skyscraper, the tallest structure in Wuhan and in Central China, is the eighth tallest structure in China. The Minsheng Bank Building, the second tallest structure in Wuhan, was the tallest building in Wuhan when it was completed in 2007. It retained the title until Wuhan Center surpassed it in 2014. Wuhan World Trade Tower is a 273-meter (896 foot) tall skyscraper located in Wuhan. It became the tallest building in Wuhan after its completion in 1998. However, it was surpassed by the Minsheng Bank Building in 2007.\nThe Wuhan Greenland Center is a planned 636-meter (2,087 ft), 126-floor mixed-use skyscraper currently under construction and scheduled for completion in 2019. If completed as planned, it will be among the world's tallest structures, and one of the world's tallest buildings by occupiable floor height. The Phoenix Towers are proposed supertall skyscrapers planned for construction in Wuhan. At 1 kilometer (3,300 ft) high, the towers would also be among the tallest structures in the world when completed.\n\n\n== Notable Wuhanese ==\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nLi Yuanhong \u2013 former President of the Republic of China (1916\u201317, 1922\u201323).\nWu Yi \u2013 former Vice-Premier and Minister of Health of the People's Republic of China\n\n\n=== Business ===\nWei Brian - Chinese entrepreneur\n\n\n=== Science ===\nChang-Lin Tien \u2013 seventh Chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley (1990\u20131997) and a major founder of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering (NAE).

          "I visited this bridge in 2010, and then again on my last visit to Wuhan in October, 2014. It should not be missed. It's hard to describe the feeling when you are looking at it, but it's a very beautiful area, evoking tranquility, history, and culture, with many sculptures",
          "I crossed this bridge by car, by bicycle and on foot and just because some people say it's an attraction does not make it one. The bridge has no unique design or engineering... the guards in the guard booths are the most interesting part and won't let you take their picture.",
          "Certainly not worth a trip of it's own, but if you are already going to the Yellow Crane Tower and want to take a small detour, it has a nice view.",
          "We were touring and took a boat ride beneath the bridge last May and it was a misty view as we approached it. We didn't get to walk across it. It was apparently the first bridge across the Yangtze for trains, cars and people. It was a huge concrete structure - it wouldn't win",
          "It was a clear sunny day, and a perfect day to walk over this bridge. The views were nice, but knowing I was actually crossing the Yangtze was what thrilled me most. It also gave me the chance to see the yellow crane tower for the very first time. All in all it was a nice walk",
          "This is the first bridge over yangtze river, built by Chinese but under the consultancy of Russian engineers. Very solid bridge, and even better quality than most of the recent bridges built in the last 20 years. Worth walking from turtle hill to snake hill, if not foggy.",
          "This was the original Yangtze River bridge built in Wuhan in the 1950's, with the upper level devoted to cars and the lower level to trains. We were staying at the Holiday Inn Riverside that is within walking distance of the bridge, we also drove across the bridge to visit the",
          "That\u00b4s all I can say. It\u00b4s a bridge. A long bridge. What more? If you\u00b4re for any reason closeby, ok go and see. If not, does not worth any effort.",
          "It is a nice place see the sunset in Wuhan. Most important, it is free of charge and can be reached easily by many routes of public bus!",
          "Not the most beautiful bridge. Guess it's fame is due to it's Russian technology in 50's and being the 1st bridge of it's kind. Took a bus from yellow crane tower entrance (non-staircase one) and cross the bridge. Not bad.",
          "Ok so it's a bridge... though if you're like me and the biggest river you'd ever seen before this is the Murray then you're pretty amazed by the size of the River. Wuhan itself is a crazy, busy and I dare say dirty city.",
          "If you want to see a bridge then fantastic. That is all. Okay to walk over but quite long: I would recommend getting the ferry across the river for 2 kuai instead.",
          "the brdige is awesome. if you wanna walk, tat will be super awesome but there is a bridge foot walk fee and its pretty expensive. but bear in mind, this is the longest bridge ober the Yangtze. take a normal public bus and u will still feel the buzz.",
          "We were there middle day and it was hot so we didn't spend a lots of time there. We totally enjoyed the boat ride and saw the two rivers",
          "Well - this is i a long and old bridge and is very impressing - especially if you think of the time it was built... but actually the park underneath it on the Hanyang side is also nice",
          "I believe this is 1st Bridge and it is very near The Yellow Crane Tower. It is a favorite for people to walk across and under the foot of the WuChang side is a great little street that has lots of specialty & nick knack shops and large wonderful food vendor ally area where you",
          "As we know wuhan city is combained with three parts ,hankou hanyang and wuchang.Hanyang and wuchan is commbined with this bridge.the bridge has two floors the first floor is for bus and the second floor is for train.The bridge was build in 1956 with the help of fomer Russia.the",
          "joining the average people and dancing under the great bridge with all kinds of colour of lights reflect inside the water ....so relaxed that you can forget all the pain or unhappy moments in the day and smile to what life has given us!",
          "It's a bridge, the first one across the Yangtze, built during the 50s. It's nothing special. It's not the Golden Gate. See it best from Yellow Crane Tower on a clear day. Your best chance of that is in the spring or fall after a good rain.",
          "The bridge is nice from a distance. Walk along the Yangtze river with a great view of the bridge. Great for pictures around sunset.",
          "\"Da Qiao\", or the First Bridge of Yangtze River in Wuhan, was built in the late 50s when my parents were born. Today it still stands grand and firm as a major transportation route across the big river. The bridge is almost at the center of old Wuhan city and conveniently located",

        "wiki": "Wuhan (simplified Chinese: \u6b66\u6c49; traditional Chinese: \u6b66\u6f22, [\u00f9.x\u00e2n] (listen)) is the capital city of Hubei Province in the People's Republic of China. It is the largest city in Hubei and the most populous city in Central China, with a population of over 11 million, the ninth most populous Chinese city and one of the nine National Central Cities of China.The name \"Wuhan\" came from the city's historical origin from the conglomeration of Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang, which are collectively known as the \"Three Towns of Wuhan\" (\u6b66\u6c49\u4e09\u9547).  It lies in the eastern Jianghan Plain, at the confluence of the Yangtze river and its largest tributary, the Han River and is known as \"Nine Provinces' Thoroughfare\" (\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862).Wuhan is considered by some to be one of the potential sites of the pivotal Battle of the Red Cliffs, which stopped warlord Cao Cao's incursion into southern China at the end of the Eastern Han dynasty. Other historical events taking place in Wuhan include the Wuchang Uprising of 1911, which led to the downfall of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China. Wuhan was briefly the capital of China in 1927 under the left wing of the Kuomintang (KMT) government led by Wang Jingwei. The city later served as the wartime capital of China for ten months in 1937 during the Second Sino-Japanese War. A novel coronavirus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic was first identified in Wuhan in December 2019.Wuhan is considered the political, economic, financial, commercial, cultural and educational center of Central China. It is a major transportation hub, with dozens of railways, roads and expressways passing through the city and connecting to other major cities. Because of its key role in domestic transportation, Wuhan is sometimes referred to as \"the Chicago of China\" by foreign sources. The \"Golden Waterway\" of the Yangtze River and the Han River traverse the urban area and divide Wuhan into the three districts of Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge crosses the Yangtze in the city. The Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest power station in terms of installed capacity, is located nearby. Historically, Wuhan has suffered risks of flooding, prompting the government to alleviate the situation by introducing ecologically friendly absorption mechanisms.While Wuhan has been a traditional manufacturing hub for decades, it is also one of the areas promoting modern industrial changes in China. Wuhan consists of three national development zones, four scientific and technological development parks, over 350 research institutes, 1,656 high tech enterprises, numerous enterprise incubators and investments from 230 Fortune Global 500 firms. It produced GDP of US$22.4 billion in 2018. The Dongfeng Motor Corporation, an automobile manufacturer, is headquartered in Wuhan. The city is home to multiple notable institutes of higher education, including Wuhan University and the Huazhong University of Science and Technology. In 2017, Wuhan was designated as a Creative City by UNESCO, in the field of design. Wuhan is classified as a Beta world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Wuhan\" is a portmanteau of the two major cities on the northern and southern banks of the Yangtze River that make up the Wuhan metropolis: \"Wu\" refers to the city of Wuchang (Chinese: \u6b66\u660c), which lies on the southern bank of the Yangtze, while \"Han\" refers to the city of Hankou (Chinese: \u6c49\u53e3), which lies on the northern bank of the Yangtze.\nIn 1926, the Northern Expedition reached the Wuhan area and it was decided to merge Hankou, Wuchang and Hanyang into one city in order to make a new capital for Nationalist China. On January 1, 1927, the resulting city was proclaimed as '\u6b66\u6f22' (the traditional Chinese characters for 'Wuhan'), which was later simplified as '\u6b66\u6c49' (also 'Wuhan').\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nThe Wuhan area has been settled for 3,500 years. Panlongcheng, an archaeological site primarily associated with the Erligang culture (c. 1510 \u2013 c. 1460 BC) (being sparsely populated during the earlier Erlitou period), is located in modern-day Huangpi District.\nDuring the Western Zhou the State of E, which gives its name to the single character abbreviation for Hubei province, controlled the present-day Wuchang area south of the Yangtze River. After the conquest of the E state in 863 BC, the present-day Wuhan area was controlled by the State of Chu for the rest of the Western Zhou and Eastern Zhou periods.  Chu was in turn conquered by Qin in 223 BCE.\n\n\n=== Imperial China ===\n\nDuring the Han dynasty, Hanyang became a fairly busy port. The Battle of Xiakou in AD 203 and Battle of Jiangxia five years later were fought over control of Jiangxia Commandery (present-day Xinzhou District in northeast Wuhan). In the winter of 208/9, one of the most famous battles in Chinese history and a central event in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms\u2014the Battle of Red Cliffs\u2014took place near the Yangtze River, with the cliffs near Wuhan identified as one of the potential locations. Around that time, walls were built to protect Hanyang (AD 206) and Wuchang (AD 223). The latter event marks the foundation of Wuhan. In AD 223, the Yellow Crane Tower, one of the Four Great Towers of China, was constructed on the Wuchang side of the Yangtze River by order of Sun Quan, leader of the Eastern Wu. The tower become a sacred site of Taoism.Due to tensions between the Eastern Wu and Cao Wei kingdoms, in the autumn of 228, Cao Rui, grandson of Cao Cao and the second emperor of the state of Cao Wei, ordered the general Man Chong to lead troops to Xiakou (\u590f\u53e3; in present-day Wuhan). In 279, Wang Jun and his army conquered strategic locations in Wu territory such as Xiling (in present-day Yichang, Hubei), Xiakou (\u590f\u53e3; present-day Hankou) and Wuchang (\u6b66\u660c; present-day Ezhou, Hubei).\nDuring the Northern and Southern dynasties period, the Wuhan area was part of the successive Southern dynasty states Liu Song (420\u2013479), Southern Qi (479\u2013502), Liang, and Western Liang.\nIn fall 550, Hou Jing sent Ren Yue to attack both Xiao Daxin and Xiao Fan's son Xiao Si (\u856d\u55e3).  Ren killed Xiao Si in battle, and Xiao Daxin, unable to resist, surrendered, allowing Hou to take his domain under control.  Meanwhile, Xiao Guan, who had by now settled at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan), was planning to attack Hou, but this drew Xiao Yi's ire\u2014believing that Xiao Guan was intending to contend for the throne\u2014and he sent Wang to attack Xiao Guan. In summer 567, Chen Xu commissioned Wu Mingche as the governor of Xiang Province and had him command a major part of the troops against Hua, along with Chunyu Liang (\u6df3\u4e8e\u91cf). The opposing sides met at Zhuankou (\u6c8c\u53e3, in modern Wuhan).\nThe city has long been renowned as a center for the arts (especially poetry) and for intellectual studies. Cui Hao, a celebrated poet of the Tang dynasty, visited the Yellow Crane Tower in the early 8th century; his poem made it the most celebrated building in southern China.In spring 877, Wang Xianzhi captured E Prefecture (\u9102\u5dde, in modern Wuhan).  He then returned north, joining forces with Huang again, and they surrounded Song Wei at Song Prefecture (\u5b8b\u5dde, in modern Shangqiu, Henan).  In winter 877, Huang Chao pillaged Qi and Huang (\u9ec3\u5dde, in modern Wuhan) Prefectures.\nBefore Kublai Khan arrived in 1259, word reached him that M\u00f6ngke had died. Kublai decided to keep the death of his brother secret and continued the attack on the Wuhan area, near the Yangtze. The present-day Wuying Pagoda was constructed at the end of the Song Dynasty between attacks by the Mongolian forces.  Under the Mongol rulers (Yuan dynasty) (after 1301), the Wuchang prefecture, headquartered in the town, became the capital of Hubei province. Hankou, from the Ming to late Qing, was under the administration of the local government in Hanyang, although it was already one of the four major national markets (zh:\u56db\u5927\u540d\u9547) of the Ming dynasty.\nHanyang's Guiyuan Temple was completed in the 15th year of Shunzhi (1658).By the dawn of the 18th century, Hankou had become one of China's top four most important towns of trade. In the late 19th century, railroads were extended on a north\u2013south axis through the city, making Wuhan an important transshipment point between rail and river traffic. Also during this period foreign powers extracted mercantile concessions, with the riverfront of Hankou being divided up into foreign-controlled merchant districts. These districts contained trading firm offices, warehouses, and docking facilities. The French had a concession in Hankou. During the Taiping Rebellion, the Wuhan area was controlled for many years by rebel forces and the Yellow Crane Tower, Xingfu Temple, Zhuodaoquan Temple and other buildings were repurposed or damaged. During the Second Opium War (known in the West as the Arrow War, 1856\u20131860), the government of the Qing dynasty was defeated by the western powers and signed the Treaties of Tianjin and the Convention of Peking, which stipulated eleven cities or regions (including Hankou) as trading ports. In December 1858, James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, High Commissioner to China, led four warships up the Yangtze River in Wuhan to collect the information needed for opening the trading port in Wuhan.\nIn the spring of 1861, Counselor Harry Parkes and Admiral Herbert were sent to Wuhan to open a trading port. On the basis of the Convention of Peking, Harry Parkes concluded the Hankou Lend-Lease Treaty with Guan Wen, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei. It brought an area of 30.53 square kilometers (11.79 sq mi) along the Yangtze River (from latter-day Jianghan Road to Hezuo Road) to become a British Concession and permitted Britain to set up its consulate in the concession.\n\nIn 1889, Zhang Zhidong was transferred from Viceroy of Liangguang (Guangdong and Guangxi provinces) to Viceroy of Huguang (Hunan and Hubei provinces). He governed the province for 18 years, until 1907. During this period, he elucidated the theory of \"Chinese learning as the basis, Western learning for application,\" known as the ti-yong ideal. He set up many heavy industries, founded Hanyang Steel Plant, Daye Iron Mine, Pingxiang Coal Mine and Hubei Arsenal and set up local textile industries, boosting the flourishing modern industry in Wuhan. Meanwhile, he initiated education reform, opened dozens of modern educational organizations successively, such as Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) Academy of Classical Learning, Civil General Institute, Military General Institute, Foreign Languages Institute and Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) General Normal School, and selected a great many students for study overseas, which well promoted the development of China's modern education. Furthermore, he trained a modern military and organized a modern army including a zhen and a xie (both zhen and xie are military units in the Qing dynasty) in Hubei.\nOriginally known as the Hubei Arsenal, the Hanyang Arsenal was founded in 1891 by Qing official Zhang Zhidong, who diverted funds from the Nanyang Fleet in Guangdong to build the arsenal. It cost about 250,000 pounds sterling and was built in 4 years. On 23 April 1894, construction was completed and the arsenal, occupying some 40 acres (160,000 m2), could start production of small-caliber cannons. It built magazine-fed rifles, Gruson quick fire guns, and cartridges.\n\n\n==== Wuchang Uprising ====\n\nBy 1900, according to Collier's magazine, Hankau, the Yangtze River boom town, was \"the St. Louis and Chicago of China.\" On October 10, 1911, Sun Yat-sen's followers launched the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the collapse of the Qing dynasty, as well as the establishment of the Chinese Republic.The Wuchang Uprising of October 1911, which overthrew the Qing dynasty, originated in Wuhan. Before the uprising, anti-Qing secret societies were active in Wuhan. In September 1911, the outbreak of the protests in Sichuan forced the Qing authorities to send part of the New Army garrisoned in Wuhan to suppress the rebellion. On September 14 the Literary Society (\u6587\u5b78\u793e) and the Progressive Association (\u5171\u9032\u6703), two local revolutionary organizations in Hubei, set up joint headquarters in Wuchang and planned for an uprising. On the morning of October 9, a bomb at the office of the political arrangement exploded prematurely and alerted local authorities. The proclamation for the uprising, beadroll and the revolutionaries\u2019 official seal fell into the hands of Rui Cheng, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei, who demolished the uprising headquarters the same day and set out to arrest the revolutionaries listed in the beadroll. This forced the revolutionaries to launch the uprising earlier than planned.On the night of October 10, the revolutionaries fired shots to signal the uprising at the engineering barracks of Hubei New Army. They then led the New Army of all barracks to join the revolution. Under the guidance of Wu Zhaolin, Cai Jimin and others, this revolutionary army seized the official residence of the governor and government offices. Rui Cheng fled in panic into the Chuyu ship. Zhang Biao, the commander of the Qing army, also fled the city. On the morning of the 11th, the revolutionary army took the whole city of Wuchang, but leaders such as Jiang Yiwu and Sun Wu disappeared. Thus the leaderless revolutionary army recommended Li Yuanhong, the assistant governor of the Qing army, as the commander-in-chief. Li founded the Hubei Military Government, proclaimed the abolition of the Qing rule in Hubei, the founding of the Republic of China and published an open telegram calling for other provinces to join the revolution.As the revolution spread to other parts of the country, the Qing government concentrated loyalist military forces to suppress the uprising in Wuhan. From October 17 to December 1, the revolutionary army and local volunteers defended the city in the Battle of Yangxia against better armed and more numerous Qing forces commanded by Yuan Shikai. Huang Xing would arrive in Wuhan in early November to take command of the revolutionary army. After fierce fighting and heavy casualties, Qing forces seized Hankou and Hanyang. But Yuan agreed to halt the advance on Wuchang and participated in peace talks, which would eventually lead to the return of Sun Yat-sen from exile, founding of the Republic of China on January 1, 1912. Through the Wuchang Uprising, Wuhan is known as the birthplace of the Xinhai Revolution, named after the Xinhai year on the Chinese calendar. The city has several museums and memorials to the revolution and the thousands of martyrs who died defending the revolution.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\n\nWith the northern extension of the Northern Expedition, the center of the Great Revolution shifted from the Pearl River basin to the Yangtze River basin. On November 26, the Kuomintang Central Political Committee decided to move the capital from Guangzhou to Wuhan. In mid-December, most of the KMT central executive commissioners and national government commissioners arrived in Wuhan, set up the temporary joint conference of central executive commissioners and National Government commissioners, performed the top functions of central party headquarters and National Government, declared they would work in Wuhan on January 1, 1927, and decided to combine the towns of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang into Wuhan City, called \"Capital District\". The new national government, later known as \"Wuhan nationalist government\", was based in the Nanyang Building in Hankou, while the central party headquarters and other organizations chose their locations in Hankou or Wuchang.In March 1927, Mao Zedong appeared at the Third Plenum of the KMT Central Executive Committee in Wuhan, which sought to strip General Chiang of his power by appointing Wang Jingwei leader. The first phase of the Northern Expedition was interrupted by the political split in the Kuomintang following the formation of the Nanjing faction in April 1927 against the existing faction in Wuhan. Members of the Chinese Communist Party, who had survived the April 12 massacre, met at Wuhan and reelected Chen Duxiu (Ch'en Tu-hsiu) as the Party's Secretary General. The split was partially motivated by the purge of the Communists within the party, which marked the end of the First United Front, and Chiang Kai-shek briefly stepped down as the commander of the National Revolutionary Army.In June 1927, Stalin sent a telegram to the Communists in Wuhan, calling for the mobilization of an army of workers and peasants. This alarmed Wang Jingwei, who decided to break with the Communists and come to terms with Chiang Kai-shek. The Wuhan coup was a political shift made on July 15, 1927, by Wang Jingwei towards Chiang Kai-shek, and his Shanghai-based rival in the Kuomintang. The Wuhan Nationalist Government was established in Wuhan on February 21, 1927, and ended by August 19, 1927. After the end of the Northern Expedition, Hankou was elevated to a centrally-controlled municipality.\n\nIn the 1931 China floods, one of the deadliest flood disasters in world history, Wuhan was a refuge for flood victims from outlying areas, who had been arriving since the late spring. But when the city itself was inundated in the early summer, and after a catastrophic dike failure just before 6:00 AM on July 27, an estimated 782,189 urban citizens and rural refugees were left homeless. The flood covered an area of 32 square miles and the city was flooded under many feet of water for close to three months. Large numbers gathered on flood islands throughout the city, with 30,000 sheltering on a railway embankment in central Hankou. With little food and a complete breakdown in sanitation, thousands soon began to succumb to diseases. Jin Shilong, Senior Engineer at the Hubei Flood Prevention Agency, described the flooding:There was no warning, only a sudden great wall of water. Most of Wuhan's buildings in those days were only one story high, and for many people there was no escape- they died by the tens of thousands. ... I was just coming off duty at the company's main office, a fairly new three-story building near the center of town ... When I heard the terrible noise and saw the wall of water coming, I raced to the top story of the building. ... I was in one of the tallest and strongest buildings left standing. At that time no one knew whether the water would subside or rise even higher.The high-water mark was reached on 19 August at Hankou, with the water level exceeding 16 m (53 ft) above normal. In 1936, when natural disaster struck Central China with widespread flooding affecting Hebei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Wuhan and Chongqing caused by the Yangtze and Huai Rivers bursting their banks, Ong Seok Kim, as Chairman of the Sitiawan Fundraising and Disaster Relief Committee, raised money and materials in support of the victims.\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War and following the fall of Nanking in December 1937, Wuhan had become the provisional capital of China's Kuomintang government, and became another focal point of pitched air battles beginning in early 1938 between modern monoplane bomber and fighter aircraft of the Imperial Japanese forces and the Chinese Air Force, which included support from the Soviet Volunteer Group in both planes and personnel, as U.S. support in war materials waned. As the battle raged on through 1938, Wuhan and the surrounding region had become the site of the Battle of Wuhan. After being taken by the Japanese in late 1938, Wuhan became a major Japanese logistics center for operations in southern China.\n\nIn early October 1938, Japanese troops moved east and north in the outskirts of Wuhan. As a result, numerous companies and enterprises and large numbers of people had to withdraw from Wuhan to the west of Hubei and Sichuan. The KMT navy undertook the responsibility of defending the Yangtze River on patrol and covering the withdrawal. On October 24, while overseeing the waters of the Yangtze River near the town of Jinkou (Jiangxia District in Wuhan) in Wuchang, the KMT gunboat Zhongshan came up against six Japanese aircraft. Though two were eventually shot down, the Zhongshan sank with 25 casualties. Raised from the bottom of the Yangtze River in 1997, and restored at a local shipyard, the Zhongshan has been moved to a purpose-built museum in Wuhan's suburban Jiangxia District, which opened on September 26, 2011.As a key center on the Yangtze, Wuhan was an important base for Japanese operations in China. On 18 December 1944, Wuhan was bombed by 77 American bombers that set off a firestorm that destroyed much of the city. For the next three days, Wuhan was bombed by the Americans, destroying all of the docks and warehouses of Wuhan, as well as the Japanese air bases in the city. The air raids killed thousands of Chinese civilians which American bombers did not know. \"According to casualty statistics compiled by Hankou city in 1946, more than 20,000 were killed or injured in the December bombings of 1944.\"Wuhan returned to Chinese control in September 1945. Administratively, Wuchang and Hanyang were initially combined into a new City of Wuchang, but in October 1946 were separated into the City of Wuchang (including Wuchang only) and the County of Hanyang. Hankou became a centrally controlled municipality in August 1947. Militarily, the Wuhan Forward Headquarters was established in Wuhan, headed by Bai Chongxi.\n\nDuring the later stages of the Chinese Civil War, Bai sought to broker peace, proposing that the Communist Party could rule northern China while the Nationalist government retained southern China. This was rejected, and on 15 May 1949 Bai and the Wuhan garrison retreated from the city. People's Liberation Army troops entered Wuhan on the afternoon of Monday, May 16, 1949.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n\nThe Changjiang Water Resources Commission was reestablished in February 1950 with its headquarters in Wuhan. From June to September 1954, the Yangtze River Floods were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to an unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. In 1969, a large stone monument was erected in the riverside park in Hankou honoring the heroic deeds in fighting the 1954 Yangtze River floods.\nBefore construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, Hunslet Engine Company built two extra heavy 0-8-0 locomotives for loading the train ferries for crossing the Yangtze River in Wuhan.\nThe project of building the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also known as the First Yangtze River Bridge, was regarded as one of the key projects during the first five-year plan. On October 25, 1955, construction began on the bridge proper. The same day in 1957, the whole project was completed and an opening-to-traffic ceremony was held on October 15. The First Yangtze River Bridge united the Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway with the Guangdong\u2013Hankou Railway into the Beijing\u2013Guangzhou Railway, making Wuhan a 'thoroughfare to nine provinces' (\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862) in name and in fact.\nAfter Chengdu Conference, Mao went to Chongqing and Wuhan in April to inspect the countryside and factories. In Wuhan, he called all the leaders of provinces and municipalities who had not attended Chengdu Conference to report their work. Tian Jiaying, the secretary of Mao, said that Wuhan Conference was a supplement to Chengdu Conference.In July 1967, civil strife struck the city in the Wuhan Incident (\"July 20th Incident\"), an armed conflict between two hostile groups who were fighting for control over the city at the height of the Cultural Revolution.In 1981, the Wuhan City Government commenced reconstruction of the Yellow Crane Tower at a new location, about 1 km (0.62 mi) from the original site, and it was completed in 1985. In 1957, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was built with one trestle of the bridge on the site of the tower, which had been last destroyed in 1884.During the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, students in Wuhan blocked the Yangtze River Railway bridge and another 4,000 gathered at the railway station. About one thousand students staged a railroad 'sit-in'. Rail traffic on the Beijing-Guangzhou and Wuhan-Dalian lines was interrupted. The students also urged employees of major state-owned enterprises to go on strike. The situation was so tense that residents reportedly began a bank run and resorted to panic-buying.\n\nIn the wake of the United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade on May 7, 1999, protests broke out throughout China, including in Wuhan.On June 22, 2000, a Wuhan Airlines flight from Enshi to Wuhan was forced to circle for 30 minutes due to thunderstorms. The aircraft eventually crashed on the banks of Han River in Hanyang District, all on-board perished (there were varying accounts of number of crews and passengers). In addition, the crash also killed 7 people on the ground.Chinese protesters organized boycotts of the French-owned retail chain Carrefour in major Chinese cities including Kunming, Hefei and Wuhan, accusing the French nation of pro-secessionist conspiracy and anti-Chinese racism. The BBC reported that hundreds of people demonstrated in Beijing, Wuhan, Hefei, Kunming and Qingdao. On May 19, 2011, Fang Binxing, the Principal of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (also known as \"Father of China's Great Fire Wall\") was hit on the chest by a shoe thrown at him by a Huazhong University of Science and Technology student who calls herself \"hanjunyi\" (\u5bd2\u541b\u4f9d, or \u5c0f\u6e56\u5317) while Fang was giving a lecture at Wuhan University.The city has been subject to devastating floods, which are now supposed to be controlled by the ambitious Three Gorges Dam, a project which was completed in 2008. The 2008 Chinese winter storms damaged water supply equipment in Wuhan: up to 100,000 people were out of running water when several water pipes burst, cutting the supply to local households. The 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat wave hit Wuhan on July 3.\nIn the 2010 China floods, the Han River at Wuhan experienced its worst flooding in twenty years, as officials continued sandbagging efforts along the Han and Yangtze Rivers in the city and checked reservoirs. In the 2011 China floods, Wuhan was flooded, with parts of the city losing power. In the 2016 China floods, Wuhan saw 570 mm (22 in) of rainfall during the first week of July, surpassing the record that fell on the city in 1991. A red alert for heavy rainfall was issued on 2 July, the same day that eight people died after a 15-meter (49 ft) section of a 2 m (6.6 ft) tall wall collapsed on top of them. The city's subway system, the Wuhan Metro was partially submerged as was the main railway station. At least 14 city residents were killed, one was missing, and more than 80,000 were relocated.In early July 2019, there were protests against plans for a new incinerator in Xinzhou District.The 2019 Military World Games were hosted in Wuhan in October.\nIn December 2019, an epidemic of a new coronavirus disease began in Wuhan. The disease, which became known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), spread and developed into the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Wuhan and other Hubei cities were placed under lockdown for nearly three months to contain the disease. On April 8, 2020, the Wuhan lockdown officially came to an end after no new domestic cases were reported in Hubei province.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Overview ===\n\nWuhan is in east-central Hubei, at latitude 29\u00b0 58'\u201331\u00b0 22' N and longitude 113\u00b0 41'\u2013115\u00b0 05' E. Wuhan sits at the confluence of the Han River flowing into the Yangtze River at the East of the Jianghan Plain along the Yangtze's middle reaches.\nThe metropolitan area comprises three parts\u2014Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang\u2014commonly called the \"Three Towns of Wuhan\" (hence the name \"Wuhan\", combining \"Wu\" from the first city and \"Han\" from the other two). The consolidation of these cities occurred in 1927 and Wuhan was thereby established. The three former cities face each other across the rivers and are linked by bridges, including one of the first modern bridges in China, known as the \"First Bridge\".\n\nWuchang lies South East of the Yangtze River that separates it from both Hankou and Hanyang.\nHankou sits North of the Yangtze River separating it from Wuchang. Hankou is North of the Han River separating it from Hanyang.\nHanyang lies West of the Yangtze separating it from Wuchang. Hanyang is south of the Han river separating it from Hankou.\nIt is simple in terrain \u2014 low and flat in the middle and hilly in the south, with the Yangtze and Han rivers winding through the city. The She River enters the Yangtze in Huangpi District. Wuhan occupies a land area of 8,494.41 square kilometers (3,279.71 sq mi), most of which is alluvial plain and decorated with hills and a great number of lakes and ponds. Water makes up one quarter of Wuhan's urban territory, which is the highest percentage among  major cities in China. Wuhan has nearly 200 lakes, including the East Lake of 33 km2, and Tangxun Lake, which are the largest lakes entirely within a city in China.Other well-known lakes include South Lake and Sand Lake. Liangzi Lake, the largest lake by surface area in Hubei province, is located in the southeast of Jiangxia District. At 709 m (2,326 ft) above sea level, the highest point in Wuhan is the main peak of Yunwu Mountain (\u4e91\u96fe\u5c71) in northwestern Huangpi District. There are also several mountains within the city limits of Wuhan including Mount Luojia (\u73de\u73c8\u5c71) in Wuchang District as well as Mount Hong (\u6d2a\u5c71) and Mount Yujia (\u55bb\u5bb6\u5c71/\u745c\u73c8\u5c71) in Hongshan District.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nWuhan's climate is humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) with abundant rainfall in summer and four distinctive seasons. Wuhan is known for its humid summers, when dewpoints can often reach 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) or more. Historically, along with Chongqing and Nanjing, Wuhan is referred to as one of the \"Three Furnacelike Cities\" along the Yangtze River for their hot summers. However, the climate data of recent years suggests that Wuhan is no longer among the top tier of \"The hottest cities in summer\" list, the New Four Furnacelike Cities are Chongqing, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, and Nanchang. Spring and autumn are generally mild, while winter is cool with quite low rainfall and occasional snow. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from 4.0 \u00b0C (39.2 \u00b0F) in January to 29.1 \u00b0C (84.4 \u00b0F) in July. Annual precipitation totals just under 1,320 mm (52 in), the majority of which falls from April to July; the annual mean temperature is 17.13 \u00b0C (62.8 \u00b0F), the frost-free period lasts 211 to 272 days. With monthly possible sunshine percentage ranging from 31 percent in March to 59 percent in August, the city proper receives 1,865 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extreme low and high temperatures recorded are \u221218.1 \u00b0C (\u22121 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1977 and 39.7 \u00b0C (103 \u00b0F) on 27 July 2017 (unofficial record of 41.3 \u00b0C (106 \u00b0F) in 1934).\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nWuhan is a sub-provincial city. Municipal government is regulated by the local Communist Party of China (CPC), led by the Wuhan CPC Secretary (Chinese: \u6b66\u6c49\u5e02\u59d4\u4e66\u8bb0), Wang Zhonglin (\u738b\u5fe0\u6797). The local CPC issues administrative orders, collects taxes, manages the economy, and directs a standing committee of the Municipal People's Congress in making policy decisions and overseeing the local government.\nGovernment officials include the mayor (\u5e02\u957f), Zhou Xianwang (\u5468\u5148\u65fa), and vice-mayors. Numerous bureaus focus on law, public security, and other affairs.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nThe sub-provincial city of Wuhan currently comprises 13 districts. As of the Sixth Census of China in 2010, the 13 districts comprised 160 township-level divisions including 156 subdistricts, 3 towns, 1 townships.\n\n\n=== Diplomatic missions ===\n\nThere are four countries that have consulates in Wuhan:\n\nThe current U.S. Consul General, the Honorable Mr. Jamie Fouss, was posted to Wuhan in August 2017. The office of the U.S. Consulate General, Central China (located in Wuhan) celebrated its official opening on November 20, 2008 and is the first new American consulate in China in over 20 years. The consulate is currently scheduled to offer visa and citizen services in the Fall of 2018.\nIn 2015, Japan\nand Russia announced their intentions to establish consular offices in Wuhan.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nUp until the 21st century, Wuhan was largely an agricultural region. Since 2004 it has been a focal point of the Rise of Central China Plan, which aims to build less-developed inland economies into hubs of advanced manufacturing.\nSince 1890, the steel industry has been the backbone of Wuhan's industry. In 2010, automobile industry exceeded GDP for Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO) steel for the first time. There are 5 car manufacturers, including Dongfeng Honda, Citroen, Shanghai GM, DFM Passenger Vehicle and Dongfeng Renault.

In the Sixth Census of China in 2010, Wuhan's built-up area made of 8 out of 10 urban districts (all but Xinzhou and Hannan not yet conurbated) was home to 8,821,658 inhabitants. As of 2015, the city of Wuhan had an estimated population of 10,607,700 people.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 19 million.\nAs of November 2019, urban development status considering both spatial and socioeconomic processes has been examined using Night Time Lighting data and land cover data as proxies; it showed Wuhan's high concentration\nof socioeconomic activities compared to its urban spatial development.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nAccording to a survey published in 2017, 79.2% of the population of Wuhan are either irreligious or practice worship of gods and ancestors; among these 0.9% are Taoists. Among other religious doctrines, 14.7% of the population adheres to Buddhism, 2.9% to Protestantism, 0.3% to Catholicism and 1.6% to Islam, and 1.6% of the population adheres to unspecified other religions.\nReligious sites in Wuhan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nChina Railway Wuhan Group manages the Wuhan Railway Hub. Wuhan Railway Hub is considered one of the four key railway hubs of China. The city of Wuhan is served by three major railway stations: the Hankou Railway Station in Hankou, the Wuchang Railway Station in Wuchang, and the Wuhan Railway Station, located in a newly developed area east of the East Lake (Hongshan District). As the stations are many miles apart, it is important for passengers to be aware of the particular station(s) used by a particular train.\nThe (original) Hankou Station was the terminus for the Jinghan Railway from Beijing, while the Wuchang Station was the terminus for the Yuehan Railway to Guangzhou. Since the construction of the First Yangtze Bridge and the linking of the two lines into the Jingguang Railway, both Hankou and Wuchang stations have been served by trains going to all directions, which contrasts with the situation in such cities as New York or Moscow, where different stations serve different directions.\nWith the opening of the Hefei-Wuhan high-speed railway on April 1, 2009, Wuhan became served by high-speed trains with Hefei, Nanjing, and Shanghai; several trains a day now connect the city with Shanghai, getting there in under 6 hours. As of early 2010, most of these express trains leave from the Hankou Railway Station.\n\nIn 2006, construction began on the new Wuhan Railway Station with 11 platforms, located on the northeastern outskirts of the city. In December 2009, the station was opened, as China unveiled its second high-speed train with scheduled runs from Guangzhou to Wuhan. Billed as the fastest train in the world, it can reach a speed of 394 km/h (244.82 mph). The travel time between the two cities has been reduced from ten and a half hours to just three. The rail service has been extended north to Beijing.As of 2011, the new Wuhan Railway Station is primarily used by the Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed trains, while most regular trains to other destinations continue to use the Hankou and Wuchang stations.\n\nConstruction work is carried out on several lines of the new Wuhan Metropolitan Area Intercity Railway, which will eventually connect Wuhan's three main rail terminals with several stations throughout the city's outer areas and farther suburbs, as well as with the nearby cities of Xianning, Huangshi, Huanggang, and Xiaogan. The first line of the system, the one to Xianning, opened for passenger operations at the end of 2013. The line to Xiaogen opened on 1 December 2016 and it was extended with the opening of the Wuhan\u2013Shiyan high-speed railway to Shiyan on 29 November 2019.The main freight railway station and classification yard of the Wuhan metropolitan area is the extensive Wuhan North railway station, with 112 tracks and over 650 switches. It is located in Hengdian Subdistrict of Huangpi District, located 20 km (12 mi) north of the Wuhan Station and 23 km (14 mi) from Hankou Station.\n\n\n=== Wuhan Metro ===\n\nWuhan Metro is a rapid transit system serving the city of Wuhan. Owned and operated by Wuhan Metro Group Co., Ltd., the network now includes 9 lines, 228 stations, and 339 km (211 mi) of route length. Line 1, the first line in the system, opened on 28 July 2004, which made Wuhan became the seventh city in mainland China with rapid transit system, after Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Changchun, and Dalian. Line 2 opened on 28 December 2012 and is the first underground metro line crossing the Yangtze River. With 1.22 billion annual passengers in 2019, Wuhan Metro is the sixth-busiest rapid transit system in mainland China. There are a number of lines or sections under construction. The government of Wuhan City promised the citizens that at least two lines or sections open every year. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire network was out of service from 23 January to 27 March 2020.\n\n\n=== Trams ===\n\nTrams were brought to the streets of Wuhan on July 28, 2017 with the first line (Auto-city T1 Line) opened that day. The trams under construction or planning in Wuhan are:\n\nAuto-city trams, with Lines T1, T2, T6, and T8 in the Wuhan Economic Development Area, in the far western reaches on Hanyang. T1 Line is operational as of 2017.\nOptics Valley trams, two lines  (T1 and T2) south and east of Guanggu Circle (Guanggu Guangchang) in southeastern Wuchang. The system opened on January 18, 2018.\nThe Old Hankou Streetcar, a loop line around Hankou city.\n\n\n=== Maritime transport ===\nWuhan is a major hub for maritime transport in central China. The Port of Wuhan provide services for the local population and shipping services.\n\n\n=== Ferry ===\nAs a city located at bank of Yangtze River, Wuhan has long history of ferry services. Modern ferry services were established in 1900 by steam boat. In 1937, a train ferry was established to transport train cars from Hankou to Wuchang. There are numbered stops around Wuhan where people can get on and off the ferry and there is a tourist ferry in the night.\nCurrently, ferry services are provided by the Wuhan Ferry Company. In 2010, the company bought 10 new ships to replace the ones that had been in service for 29 years.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nOpened in April 1995 to substitute for the old Hankou Wangjiadun Airport and Nanhu Airport as the major airport of Wuhan, Wuhan Tianhe International Airport is one of the busiest airports in central China. It is located in Wuhan's suburban Huangpi District 26 kilometers (16 mi) north of Wuhan city proper. The extension of Line 2 of Wuhan Metro to Tianhe Airport opened on 28 December 2016. It has also been selected as China's fourth international hub airport after Beijing Capital International Airport, Shanghai-Pudong and Guangzhou Baiyun. A second terminal was completed in March 2008, having been started in February 2005 with an investment of CNY 3.372 billion. International flights to neighboring Asian countries have also been enhanced, including direct flights to Tokyo and Nagoya, Japan. Terminal 3 has been available for service since early 2017.\nHannan Municipal Airport is an municipal airport that serves Hannan District. It is the biggest airport in China that only handles general aviation, and the biggest municipal airport in Hubei Province. Caidian Municipal Airport is an under-construction airport which will serve Caidian District. The airport began construction on 1 December 2017.\n\n\n=== Highways and expressways ===\nNumerous major highways and expressways pass through Wuhan, including:\n\nChina National Highway 107\nChina National Highway 316\nChina National Highway 318\nG42 Shanghai\u2013Chengdu Expressway\nG0422 Wuhan\u2013Shenzhen Expressway\n\n\n=== Bicycle-sharing system ===\nAs of May 2011, the Wuhan and Hangzhou Public Bicycle bike-share systems in China were the largest in the world, with around 90,000 and 60,000 bicycles respectively. In 2012 the Wuhan and Hangzhou Public Bicycle programs in China are the largest in the world, with around 90,000 and 60,000 bicycles respectively. China has seen a rise in private \"dockless\" bike shares with fleets that dwarf systems in size outside China. Initially, a number of traditional (third generation) docked public bike systems operated by local municipal governments opened across China, with the largest ones being in Wuhan and Hangzhou.  The first was introduced in Beijing in 2007.  However, third generation bike sharing is not considered successful for the majority cities in China.  Bike sharing in Beijing virtually stopped and it also has encountered difficulties in Shanghai and Wuhan.\n\n\n== Destinations ==\n\nThe Yellow Crane Tower (Huanghelou) is presumed to have been first built in approximately 220 AD. The tower has been destroyed and reconstructed numerous times, and was burned last according to some sources in 1884. The tower underwent complete reconstruction in 1981. The reconstruction utilized modern materials and added an elevator while maintaining the traditional design in the tower's outward appearance.\nWuchang has the largest and second largest lakes within a city in China, the East Lake and Tangxun Lake, as well as the South Lake. East Lake in Wuhan is six times the size of the West Lake in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province. The total area is more than 80 km2 (31 sq mi) of which the lake is covering an area of 33 km2 (13 sq mi). In the springtime, the shores of East Lake become a garden of flowers with the Mei blossoms as the king and the Cherry Blossom as the queen among the species at East Lake Cherry Blossom Park.

The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also called the First Bridge, was built over the Yangtze in 1957, carrying a railroad directly across the river between hills known as Snake Hill and Turtle Hill. Before this bridge was built it could take up to an entire day to barge railcars across. Including its approaches, it is 5,511 feet (1,680 m) long, and it accommodates both a double-track railway on a lower deck and a four-lane roadway above. It was built with the assistance of advisers from the Soviet Union.\nThe Second Bridge, a cable-stayed bridge built of prestressed concrete, has a central span of 400 meters (1,300 feet); it is 4,678 meters (15,348 feet) in length (including 1,877 meters (6,158 feet) of the main bridge) and 26.5 to 33.5 meters (86.9 to 109.9 feet) in width. Its main bridgeheads are 90 meters (300 feet) high each, pulling 392 thick slanting cables together in the shape of double fans so that the central span of the bridge is well poised on the piers and the bridge's stability and vibration resistance are ensured. With six lanes on the deck, the bridge is designed to handle the daily passage of 50,000 motor vehicles. The bridge was completed in 1995.\n\nThe Third Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also called Baishazhou Bridge, was completed in September 2000. Located 8.6 kilometers (5.3 miles) southwest of the First Bridge, construction of Baishazhou Bridge started in 1997. With an investment of over 1.4 billion yuan (about US$170,000,000), the bridge, which is 3,586 meters (11,765 feet) long and 26.5 meters (86.9 feet) wide, has six lanes and has a capacity of 50,000 vehicles a day. The bridge is expected to serve as a major passage for the future Wuhan Ring Road, greatly easing the city's traffic and aiding local economic development.\nThe Yangluo Bridge carries Wuhan's Ring Road across the Yangtze in the city's eastern suburbs (connecting the Hongshan District with the Xinzhou District). It was opened on December 26, 2007.\nThe Wuhan Tianxingzhou Yangtze River Bridge crosses the Yangtze in the northeastern part of the city, downstream of the Second bridge. It is named after Tianxing Island (Tianxingzhou), above which it crosses the river. Built at a cost of 11 billion yuan, the 4,657-meter cable suspension bridge was opened on December 26, 2009, in time for the opening of the Wuhan Railway Station. It is a combined road and rail bridge, and carries the Wuhan\u2013Guangzhou High-Speed Railway across the river.\n\n\n=== Skyscrapers ===\n\nThe Yellow Crane Tower, historically one of the tallest buildings in Wuhan, is considered one of the Four Great Towers of China and was destroyed twelve times, both by warfare and by fire. The tower is classified as an AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration. At 438 meters (1,437 ft) in height, the Wuhan Center skyscraper, the tallest structure in Wuhan and in Central China, is the eighth tallest structure in China. The Minsheng Bank Building, the second tallest structure in Wuhan, was the tallest building in Wuhan when it was completed in 2007. It retained the title until Wuhan Center surpassed it in 2014. Wuhan World Trade Tower is a 273-meter (896 foot) tall skyscraper located in Wuhan. It became the tallest building in Wuhan after its completion in 1998. However, it was surpassed by the Minsheng Bank Building in 2007.\nThe Wuhan Greenland Center is a planned 636-meter (2,087 ft), 126-floor mixed-use skyscraper currently under construction and scheduled for completion in 2019. If completed as planned, it will be among the world's tallest structures, and one of the world's tallest buildings by occupiable floor height.

        "wiki": "East Lake (simplified Chinese: \u4e1c\u6e56; traditional Chinese: \u6771\u6e56; pinyin: D\u014dng H\u00fa) is a large freshwater lake within the city limits of Wuhan, China, the largest or the second largest urban lake in China.  Wuhan's East Lake covers an area of 88 square kilometers (33 square kilometers of water area).  It is one of the 5A tourist zones of China, and admits over a million people yearly. It is one of the largest sites in Huazhong District. It is also the largest \"City Lake\" in China. East Lake is made of four areas, Ting Tao, Moshan, Luo Yan Island and Museum of Hubei Province.\n\nOne end of Moshan features a Daoist temple built over the putative site of where one of the characters in Romance of the Three Kingdoms performed special Qi Men Dun Jia rites before the famous battle of Red Cliffs. No one knows precisely the actual location, but the Moshan site was an archeological dig in the early part of the twentieth century.\n\n\n== Environmental issues ==\nThe lake was cut off from the Yangtze River in 1957.  Water quality has deteriorated since because of 180,000 tons discharge of wastewater (domestic sewage and industrial) into the lake per day.  Each year, about 441 tons of nitrogen and 40 tons of phosphorus flow into the lake.  Most parts of the lake have been assessed as eutrophicated, unsuitable for drinking and many recreational purposes.\n\n\n== Notable sites around the lake ==\n\nIn clockwise order, starting from the southwest corner:\n\nLiyuan Park - a large urban park on the west side of the lake, with a popular free swimming area\nHubei Provincial Museum\nHubei Art Museum; the two museums are across the street from each other, just a block from the main entrance to Liyuan Park\nWuhan Donghu Ocean Aquarium, proud of its flock of penguins\nWuhan Railway Station - a few km northeast of the lake\nMoshan (\u78e8\u5c71, \"Millstone Mountain\") Scenic Area, including East Lake Cherry Blossom Park\nThe \"Chu Castle\" (\u695a\u57ce)\nWuhan Botanical Garden\nEast Lake Cherry Blossom Park\nChina University of Geosciences, Wuhan Campus\n\"Ba Yi\" (\"First of August\") open-air swimming pool\nHoushan (Monkey Mountain) but no monkeys. One must travel to nearby Forest Park to see live monkeys, some un-caged.\nWuhan University main campusSeveral causeways cross the eastern part of the lake, providing access to recreational fishing sites  and beaches. In 2012, the construction of a major 6-lane road under the lake (Donghu Tongdao) was started. The Donghu Lake tunnel, China's longest tunnel under a lake, was opened to traffic at the end of 2015. A car could run through the 10.6-kilometer-long tunnel in around 15 minutes.In 2010, plans for extensive new development on the lake shores caused widespread criticism among the citizenry.\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Fishing ==\nThe East Lake has long been used by  local fishermen. According to the 1977 statistics, the annual fish yield of the 1500-hectare fishing area of the lake (\"The East lake Fish Farm\") was 450 kg/ha. The introduction of better fish management techniques have allowed the yields to increase in the following decade, with \n1840 tons by 1995.The main species with which the lake is stocked are the silver carp and the bighead carp.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nEast Lake District\n\n\n== References ==",

          "The landscaping is very nice and there are lots of shaded walking paths, and even some boat rides that will take you out on the lake. You can and should negotiate the price and distance of the boat ride as you can get a better deal than the \"listed price\". It was a very nice",
          "I suppose it depends on season. I went in Winter, and obviously no flowers were blooming. The place is divided into a few areas - I was at the Ting Tao area (I also went to the Mo Hill which I have done a separate review). There are many boats here that will take you out for a",

          "If you spend long time in a city like Wuhan you will simply need to migrate to East Lake every now and then, in order to feel that you haven't lost touch completely with nature and all. My doubt now was ranking it four or five... basing on the good it'll do you I would go for",

          "A bit of a trek by car, taxi or bus to this beautiful expansive scenic lake and mountain area. The huge lotus garden was in full bloom. With our Chinese host we strolled the many paths and took a boat ride on the lake to various spots including an amusement/arcade island,",
          "Since I visited two years ago, they have turned this once classy place into a bad version of a theme park. The statue of the poet, once quiet and respectful, now resides next to a KFC. The place is now overcrowded, like everywhere else in the area, and offers very little",
          "Unfortunately, the air pollution prevented a clear view of this lake. I'm sure it would be beautiful if it were visible. :-(",
          "It really is a easy and interesting trip around this lake with some stunning views on his \"small\" city of about 12 million people. Enjoy Duck throat and other undefinable food",
          "If you want to enjoy a relaxing outing, a walk around the East Lake area is quite nice. Follow the road around the main campus of Wuhan University. There are parks, fishing areas, docks, outdoor restaurants, a couple of nice bridges you can traverse, and places to rent small",
          "The East Lake is probably the most scenic part of Wuhan. If you look at a subway map, the lake seems accessible from some stations, but in reality you need to get a taxi, bus or some kind of transport to get there and back or walk for a half hour or so. Allow two hours if",
          "I have personally visited this place three time. Its a good place to go and relax your mind. I took part in the boat riding and swimming activities. East lake in Wuhan is just the place to go.",
          "We visited here expecting more than it delivered I think. It was very pleasant and full of families but it was fundamentally a large lake to walk around. We did hire a speed boat \u00a318.00 for the five of us which we enjoyed but was quite expensive compared to other attractions in",
          "I probably didn't see the best parts, so there may be better experiences. What I saw, and I did see a fair bit of the lake, was a small footpath going around much of the lake. You can have a nice walk, but there is lots of traffic, so not so peaceful. There are some good views",
          "Donghu (East Lake) is a good place to go if you dont have a lot else going on, there are several parks which are quite good, but most of the restaurant and bars in this area are a bit difficult to get to. The roads are also not very pedistrian friendly.",

          "It's difficult to find a quiet place in the biggest metropolis of China, but the park surrounding the east lake in Wuhan can be one of those (if not going there during holidays or weekends). Very well-kept and with really nice views.",
          "This place is good for hiking, cycling and walking around with friends or lovers. In the end of 2016 wuhan city will finish constructing a road for cycling around east lake. So now you could get from one point and back. Should be cool.",
          "It's surprising how large of a lake this is but I was surprised by the amount of development and how many roads cut through this lake. It's at the least worth a visit.",
          "Wonderful place of Wuhan, a lot to discover. Good spots for picnic and long walks. Chose good seasons for that. Don't miss the Lotus flowers!",

          "So close to the hustle and bustle of the city is this peaceful water retreat. Prefect for a day out. Make sure you go to the side where the villa is that Chairman Mao once stayed at if you want to avoid the crowds. There are trails for biking which would be a nice way to spend",

          "The lake is easily accessed from the Hubei Museum area and provides a pleasant relief from the busy city. There are many trails along the water, temples, and even some fine dining. At the end of the line, there is a gazebo and little boats come that will carry you to the shore",
          "There was a good pedestrian specially for walkers but just watch your back for bus coming, there were a lot of lotus champ in the lake with too many beautiful flowers, a lot of ancient trees and too many interesting natural things. But consider that the way is so long the best",

          "Nice park to take a walk, but I didn't see anything really special about it. I also didn't like the dirty water and polluted air.",

          "Having spent lots of time cooped up on planes and buses I really enjoyed my walk around the lake. I got in a decent 10km and the views were lovely. I have visited many lakes in China this one struck me as quite clean.",
          "Do you like the sight and smell of dead fish? Do you like watching old people spit? Do you like to see polluted water choking out the life of aquatic animals? How about trash and litter strewn about in a way that resembles a landfill? Then this is definitely where you want to",

          "The East Lake is said to be huge and beautiful. Huge indeed but the surrounding facilities are aged. Since there is not much happening in Wuhan, the lake area is a good escape for many local people. But I could only say that it is just a lake, a big lake.",

        "wiki": "Wuhan (simplified Chinese: \u6b66\u6c49; traditional Chinese: \u6b66\u6f22, [\u00f9.x\u00e2n] (listen)) is the capital city of Hubei Province in the People's Republic of China. It is the largest city in Hubei and the most populous city in Central China, with a population of over 11 million, the ninth most populous Chinese city and one of the nine National Central Cities of China.The name \"Wuhan\" came from the city's historical origin from the conglomeration of Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang, which are collectively known as the \"Three Towns of Wuhan\" (\u6b66\u6c49\u4e09\u9547).  It lies in the eastern Jianghan Plain, at the confluence of the Yangtze river and its largest tributary, the Han River and is known as \"Nine Provinces' Thoroughfare\" (\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862).Wuhan is considered by some to be one of the potential sites of the pivotal Battle of the Red Cliffs, which stopped warlord Cao Cao's incursion into southern China at the end of the Eastern Han dynasty. Other historical events taking place in Wuhan include the Wuchang Uprising of 1911, which led to the downfall of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China. Wuhan was briefly the capital of China in 1927 under the left wing of the Kuomintang (KMT) government led by Wang Jingwei. The city later served as the wartime capital of China for ten months in 1937 during the Second Sino-Japanese War. A novel coronavirus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic was first identified in Wuhan in December 2019.Wuhan is considered the political, economic, financial, commercial, cultural and educational center of Central China. It is a major transportation hub, with dozens of railways, roads and expressways passing through the city and connecting to other major cities. Because of its key role in domestic transportation, Wuhan is sometimes referred to as \"the Chicago of China\" by foreign sources. The \"Golden Waterway\" of the Yangtze River and the Han River traverse the urban area and divide Wuhan into the three districts of Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge crosses the Yangtze in the city. The Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest power station in terms of installed capacity, is located nearby. Historically, Wuhan has suffered risks of flooding, prompting the government to alleviate the situation by introducing ecologically friendly absorption mechanisms.While Wuhan has been a traditional manufacturing hub for decades, it is also one of the areas promoting modern industrial changes in China. Wuhan consists of three national development zones, four scientific and technological development parks, over 350 research institutes, 1,656 high tech enterprises, numerous enterprise incubators and investments from 230 Fortune Global 500 firms. It produced GDP of US$22.4 billion in 2018. The Dongfeng Motor Corporation, an automobile manufacturer, is headquartered in Wuhan. The city is home to multiple notable institutes of higher education, including Wuhan University and the Huazhong University of Science and Technology. In 2017, Wuhan was designated as a Creative City by UNESCO, in the field of design. Wuhan is classified as a Beta world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Wuhan\" is a portmanteau of the two major cities on the northern and southern banks of the Yangtze River that make up the Wuhan metropolis: \"Wu\" refers to the city of Wuchang (Chinese: \u6b66\u660c), which lies on the southern bank of the Yangtze, while \"Han\" refers to the city of Hankou (Chinese: \u6c49\u53e3), which lies on the northern bank of the Yangtze.\nIn 1926, the Northern Expedition reached the Wuhan area and it was decided to merge Hankou, Wuchang and Hanyang into one city in order to make a new capital for Nationalist China. On January 1, 1927, the resulting city was proclaimed as '\u6b66\u6f22' (the traditional Chinese characters for 'Wuhan'), which was later simplified as '\u6b66\u6c49' (also 'Wuhan').\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nThe Wuhan area has been settled for 3,500 years. Panlongcheng, an archaeological site primarily associated with the Erligang culture (c. 1510 \u2013 c. 1460 BC) (being sparsely populated during the earlier Erlitou period), is located in modern-day Huangpi District.\nDuring the Western Zhou the State of E, which gives its name to the single character abbreviation for Hubei province, controlled the present-day Wuchang area south of the Yangtze River. After the conquest of the E state in 863 BC, the present-day Wuhan area was controlled by the State of Chu for the rest of the Western Zhou and Eastern Zhou periods.  Chu was in turn conquered by Qin in 223 BCE.\n\n\n=== Imperial China ===\n\nDuring the Han dynasty, Hanyang became a fairly busy port. The Battle of Xiakou in AD 203 and Battle of Jiangxia five years later were fought over control of Jiangxia Commandery (present-day Xinzhou District in northeast Wuhan). In the winter of 208/9, one of the most famous battles in Chinese history and a central event in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms\u2014the Battle of Red Cliffs\u2014took place near the Yangtze River, with the cliffs near Wuhan identified as one of the potential locations. Around that time, walls were built to protect Hanyang (AD 206) and Wuchang (AD 223). The latter event marks the foundation of Wuhan. In AD 223, the Yellow Crane Tower, one of the Four Great Towers of China, was constructed on the Wuchang side of the Yangtze River by order of Sun Quan, leader of the Eastern Wu. The tower become a sacred site of Taoism.Due to tensions between the Eastern Wu and Cao Wei kingdoms, in the autumn of 228, Cao Rui, grandson of Cao Cao and the second emperor of the state of Cao Wei, ordered the general Man Chong to lead troops to Xiakou (\u590f\u53e3; in present-day Wuhan). In 279, Wang Jun and his army conquered strategic locations in Wu territory such as Xiling (in present-day Yichang, Hubei), Xiakou (\u590f\u53e3; present-day Hankou) and Wuchang (\u6b66\u660c; present-day Ezhou, Hubei).\nDuring the Northern and Southern dynasties period, the Wuhan area was part of the successive Southern dynasty states Liu Song (420\u2013479), Southern Qi (479\u2013502), Liang, and Western Liang.\nIn fall 550, Hou Jing sent Ren Yue to attack both Xiao Daxin and Xiao Fan's son Xiao Si (\u856d\u55e3).  Ren killed Xiao Si in battle, and Xiao Daxin, unable to resist, surrendered, allowing Hou to take his domain under control.  Meanwhile, Xiao Guan, who had by now settled at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan), was planning to attack Hou, but this drew Xiao Yi's ire\u2014believing that Xiao Guan was intending to contend for the throne\u2014and he sent Wang to attack Xiao Guan. In summer 567, Chen Xu commissioned Wu Mingche as the governor of Xiang Province and had him command a major part of the troops against Hua, along with Chunyu Liang (\u6df3\u4e8e\u91cf). The opposing sides met at Zhuankou (\u6c8c\u53e3, in modern Wuhan).\nThe city has long been renowned as a center for the arts (especially poetry) and for intellectual studies. Cui Hao, a celebrated poet of the Tang dynasty, visited the Yellow Crane Tower in the early 8th century; his poem made it the most celebrated building in southern China.In spring 877, Wang Xianzhi captured E Prefecture (\u9102\u5dde, in modern Wuhan).  He then returned north, joining forces with Huang again, and they surrounded Song Wei at Song Prefecture (\u5b8b\u5dde, in modern Shangqiu, Henan).  In winter 877, Huang Chao pillaged Qi and Huang (\u9ec3\u5dde, in modern Wuhan) Prefectures.\nBefore Kublai Khan arrived in 1259, word reached him that M\u00f6ngke had died. Kublai decided to keep the death of his brother secret and continued the attack on the Wuhan area, near the Yangtze. The present-day Wuying Pagoda was constructed at the end of the Song Dynasty between attacks by the Mongolian forces.  Under the Mongol rulers (Yuan dynasty) (after 1301), the Wuchang prefecture, headquartered in the town, became the capital of Hubei province. Hankou, from the Ming to late Qing, was under the administration of the local government in Hanyang, although it was already one of the four major national markets (zh:\u56db\u5927\u540d\u9547) of the Ming dynasty.\nHanyang's Guiyuan Temple was completed in the 15th year of Shunzhi (1658).By the dawn of the 18th century, Hankou had become one of China's top four most important towns of trade. In the late 19th century, railroads were extended on a north\u2013south axis through the city, making Wuhan an important transshipment point between rail and river traffic. Also during this period foreign powers extracted mercantile concessions, with the riverfront of Hankou being divided up into foreign-controlled merchant districts. These districts contained trading firm offices, warehouses, and docking facilities. The French had a concession in Hankou. During the Taiping Rebellion, the Wuhan area was controlled for many years by rebel forces and the Yellow Crane Tower, Xingfu Temple, Zhuodaoquan Temple and other buildings were repurposed or damaged. During the Second Opium War (known in the West as the Arrow War, 1856\u20131860), the government of the Qing dynasty was defeated by the western powers and signed the Treaties of Tianjin and the Convention of Peking, which stipulated eleven cities or regions (including Hankou) as trading ports. In December 1858, James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, High Commissioner to China, led four warships up the Yangtze River in Wuhan to collect the information needed for opening the trading port in Wuhan.\nIn the spring of 1861, Counselor Harry Parkes and Admiral Herbert were sent to Wuhan to open a trading port. On the basis of the Convention of Peking, Harry Parkes concluded the Hankou Lend-Lease Treaty with Guan Wen, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei. It brought an area of 30.53 square kilometers (11.79 sq mi) along the Yangtze River (from latter-day Jianghan Road to Hezuo Road) to become a British Concession and permitted Britain to set up its consulate in the concession.\n\nIn 1889, Zhang Zhidong was transferred from Viceroy of Liangguang (Guangdong and Guangxi provinces) to Viceroy of Huguang (Hunan and Hubei provinces). He governed the province for 18 years, until 1907. During this period, he elucidated the theory of \"Chinese learning as the basis, Western learning for application,\" known as the ti-yong ideal. He set up many heavy industries, founded Hanyang Steel Plant, Daye Iron Mine, Pingxiang Coal Mine and Hubei Arsenal and set up local textile industries, boosting the flourishing modern industry in Wuhan. Meanwhile, he initiated education reform, opened dozens of modern educational organizations successively, such as Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) Academy of Classical Learning, Civil General Institute, Military General Institute, Foreign Languages Institute and Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) General Normal School, and selected a great many students for study overseas, which well promoted the development of China's modern education. Furthermore, he trained a modern military and organized a modern army including a zhen and a xie (both zhen and xie are military units in the Qing dynasty) in Hubei.\nOriginally known as the Hubei Arsenal, the Hanyang Arsenal was founded in 1891 by Qing official Zhang Zhidong, who diverted funds from the Nanyang Fleet in Guangdong to build the arsenal. It cost about 250,000 pounds sterling and was built in 4 years. On 23 April 1894, construction was completed and the arsenal, occupying some 40 acres (160,000 m2), could start production of small-caliber cannons. It built magazine-fed rifles, Gruson quick fire guns, and cartridges.\n\n\n==== Wuchang Uprising ====\n\nBy 1900, according to Collier's magazine, Hankau, the Yangtze River boom town, was \"the St. Louis and Chicago of China.\" On October 10, 1911, Sun Yat-sen's followers launched the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the collapse of the Qing dynasty, as well as the establishment of the Chinese Republic.The Wuchang Uprising of October 1911, which overthrew the Qing dynasty, originated in Wuhan. Before the uprising, anti-Qing secret societies were active in Wuhan. In September 1911, the outbreak of the protests in Sichuan forced the Qing authorities to send part of the New Army garrisoned in Wuhan to suppress the rebellion. On September 14 the Literary Society (\u6587\u5b78\u793e) and the Progressive Association (\u5171\u9032\u6703), two local revolutionary organizations in Hubei, set up joint headquarters in Wuchang and planned for an uprising. On the morning of October 9, a bomb at the office of the political arrangement exploded prematurely and alerted local authorities. The proclamation for the uprising, beadroll and the revolutionaries\u2019 official seal fell into the hands of Rui Cheng, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei, who demolished the uprising headquarters the same day and set out to arrest the revolutionaries listed in the beadroll. This forced the revolutionaries to launch the uprising earlier than planned.On the night of October 10, the revolutionaries fired shots to signal the uprising at the engineering barracks of Hubei New Army. They then led the New Army of all barracks to join the revolution. Under the guidance of Wu Zhaolin, Cai Jimin and others, this revolutionary army seized the official residence of the governor and government offices. Rui Cheng fled in panic into the Chuyu ship. Zhang Biao, the commander of the Qing army, also fled the city. On the morning of the 11th, the revolutionary army took the whole city of Wuchang, but leaders such as Jiang Yiwu and Sun Wu disappeared. Thus the leaderless revolutionary army recommended Li Yuanhong, the assistant governor of the Qing army, as the commander-in-chief. Li founded the Hubei Military Government, proclaimed the abolition of the Qing rule in Hubei, the founding of the Republic of China and published an open telegram calling for other provinces to join the revolution.As the revolution spread to other parts of the country, the Qing government concentrated loyalist military forces to suppress the uprising in Wuhan. From October 17 to December 1, the revolutionary army and local volunteers defended the city in the Battle of Yangxia against better armed and more numerous Qing forces commanded by Yuan Shikai. Huang Xing would arrive in Wuhan in early November to take command of the revolutionary army. After fierce fighting and heavy casualties, Qing forces seized Hankou and Hanyang. But Yuan agreed to halt the advance on Wuchang and participated in peace talks, which would eventually lead to the return of Sun Yat-sen from exile, founding of the Republic of China on January 1, 1912. Through the Wuchang Uprising, Wuhan is known as the birthplace of the Xinhai Revolution, named after the Xinhai year on the Chinese calendar. The city has several museums and memorials to the revolution and the thousands of martyrs who died defending the revolution.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\n\nWith the northern extension of the Northern Expedition, the center of the Great Revolution shifted from the Pearl River basin to the Yangtze River basin. On November 26, the Kuomintang Central Political Committee decided to move the capital from Guangzhou to Wuhan. In mid-December, most of the KMT central executive commissioners and national government commissioners arrived in Wuhan, set up the temporary joint conference of central executive commissioners and National Government commissioners, performed the top functions of central party headquarters and National Government, declared they would work in Wuhan on January 1, 1927, and decided to combine the towns of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang into Wuhan City, called \"Capital District\". The new national government, later known as \"Wuhan nationalist government\", was based in the Nanyang Building in Hankou, while the central party headquarters and other organizations chose their locations in Hankou or Wuchang.In March 1927, Mao Zedong appeared at the Third Plenum of the KMT Central Executive Committee in Wuhan, which sought to strip General Chiang of his power by appointing Wang Jingwei leader. The first phase of the Northern Expedition was interrupted by the political split in the Kuomintang following the formation of the Nanjing faction in April 1927 against the existing faction in Wuhan. Members of the Chinese Communist Party, who had survived the April 12 massacre, met at Wuhan and reelected Chen Duxiu (Ch'en Tu-hsiu) as the Party's Secretary General. The split was partially motivated by the purge of the Communists within the party, which marked the end of the First United Front, and Chiang Kai-shek briefly stepped down as the commander of the National Revolutionary Army.In June 1927, Stalin sent a telegram to the Communists in Wuhan, calling for the mobilization of an army of workers and peasants. This alarmed Wang Jingwei, who decided to break with the Communists and come to terms with Chiang Kai-shek. The Wuhan coup was a political shift made on July 15, 1927, by Wang Jingwei towards Chiang Kai-shek, and his Shanghai-based rival in the Kuomintang. The Wuhan Nationalist Government was established in Wuhan on February 21, 1927, and ended by August 19, 1927. After the end of the Northern Expedition, Hankou was elevated to a centrally-controlled municipality.\n\nIn the 1931 China floods, one of the deadliest flood disasters in world history, Wuhan was a refuge for flood victims from outlying areas, who had been arriving since the late spring. But when the city itself was inundated in the early summer, and after a catastrophic dike failure just before 6:00 AM on July 27, an estimated 782,189 urban citizens and rural refugees were left homeless. The flood covered an area of 32 square miles and the city was flooded under many feet of water for close to three months. Large numbers gathered on flood islands throughout the city, with 30,000 sheltering on a railway embankment in central Hankou. With little food and a complete breakdown in sanitation, thousands soon began to succumb to diseases. Jin Shilong, Senior Engineer at the Hubei Flood Prevention Agency, described the flooding:There was no warning, only a sudden great wall of water. Most of Wuhan's buildings in those days were only one story high, and for many people there was no escape- they died by the tens of thousands. ... I was just coming off duty at the company's main office, a fairly new three-story building near the center of town ... When I heard the terrible noise and saw the wall of water coming, I raced to the top story of the building. ... I was in one of the tallest and strongest buildings left standing. At that time no one knew whether the water would subside or rise even higher.The high-water mark was reached on 19 August at Hankou, with the water level exceeding 16 m (53 ft) above normal. In 1936, when natural disaster struck Central China with widespread flooding affecting Hebei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Wuhan and Chongqing caused by the Yangtze and Huai Rivers bursting their banks, Ong Seok Kim, as Chairman of the Sitiawan Fundraising and Disaster Relief Committee, raised money and materials in support of the victims.\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War and following the fall of Nanking in December 1937, Wuhan had become the provisional capital of China's Kuomintang government, and became another focal point of pitched air battles beginning in early 1938 between modern monoplane bomber and fighter aircraft of the Imperial Japanese forces and the Chinese Air Force, which included support from the Soviet Volunteer Group in both planes and personnel, as U.S. support in war materials waned. As the battle raged on through 1938, Wuhan and the surrounding region had become the site of the Battle of Wuhan. After being taken by the Japanese in late 1938, Wuhan became a major Japanese logistics center for operations in southern China.\n\nIn early October 1938, Japanese troops moved east and north in the outskirts of Wuhan. As a result, numerous companies and enterprises and large numbers of people had to withdraw from Wuhan to the west of Hubei and Sichuan. The KMT navy undertook the responsibility of defending the Yangtze River on patrol and covering the withdrawal. On October 24, while overseeing the waters of the Yangtze River near the town of Jinkou (Jiangxia District in Wuhan) in Wuchang, the KMT gunboat Zhongshan came up against six Japanese aircraft. Though two were eventually shot down, the Zhongshan sank with 25 casualties. Raised from the bottom of the Yangtze River in 1997, and restored at a local shipyard, the Zhongshan has been moved to a purpose-built museum in Wuhan's suburban Jiangxia District, which opened on September 26, 2011.As a key center on the Yangtze, Wuhan was an important base for Japanese operations in China. On 18 December 1944, Wuhan was bombed by 77 American bombers that set off a firestorm that destroyed much of the city. For the next three days, Wuhan was bombed by the Americans, destroying all of the docks and warehouses of Wuhan, as well as the Japanese air bases in the city. The air raids killed thousands of Chinese civilians which American bombers did not know. \"According to casualty statistics compiled by Hankou city in 1946, more than 20,000 were killed or injured in the December bombings of 1944.\"Wuhan returned to Chinese control in September 1945. Administratively, Wuchang and Hanyang were initially combined into a new City of Wuchang, but in October 1946 were separated into the City of Wuchang (including Wuchang only) and the County of Hanyang. Hankou became a centrally controlled municipality in August 1947. Militarily, the Wuhan Forward Headquarters was established in Wuhan, headed by Bai Chongxi.\n\nDuring the later stages of the Chinese Civil War, Bai sought to broker peace, proposing that the Communist Party could rule northern China while the Nationalist government retained southern China. This was rejected, and on 15 May 1949 Bai and the Wuhan garrison retreated from the city. People's Liberation Army troops entered Wuhan on the afternoon of Monday, May 16, 1949.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n\nThe Changjiang Water Resources Commission was reestablished in February 1950 with its headquarters in Wuhan. From June to September 1954, the Yangtze River Floods were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to an unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. In 1969, a large stone monument was erected in the riverside park in Hankou honoring the heroic deeds in fighting the 1954 Yangtze River floods.\nBefore construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, Hunslet Engine Company built two extra heavy 0-8-0 locomotives for loading the train ferries for crossing the Yangtze River in Wuhan.\nThe project of building the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also known as the First Yangtze River Bridge, was regarded as one of the key projects during the first five-year plan. On October 25, 1955, construction began on the bridge proper. The same day in 1957, the whole project was completed and an opening-to-traffic ceremony was held on October 15. The First Yangtze River Bridge united the Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway with the Guangdong\u2013Hankou Railway into the Beijing\u2013Guangzhou Railway, making Wuhan a 'thoroughfare to nine provinces' (\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862) in name and in fact.\nAfter Chengdu Conference, Mao went to Chongqing and Wuhan in April to inspect the countryside and factories. In Wuhan, he called all the leaders of provinces and municipalities who had not attended Chengdu Conference to report their work. Tian Jiaying, the secretary of Mao, said that Wuhan Conference was a supplement to Chengdu Conference.In July 1967, civil strife struck the city in the Wuhan Incident (\"July 20th Incident\"), an armed conflict between two hostile groups who were fighting for control over the city at the height of the Cultural Revolution.In 1981, the Wuhan City Government commenced reconstruction of the Yellow Crane Tower at a new location, about 1 km (0.62 mi) from the original site, and it was completed in 1985. In 1957, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was built with one trestle of the bridge on the site of the tower, which had been last destroyed in 1884.During the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, students in Wuhan blocked the Yangtze River Railway bridge and another 4,000 gathered at the railway station. About one thousand students staged a railroad 'sit-in'. Rail traffic on the Beijing-Guangzhou and Wuhan-Dalian lines was interrupted. The students also urged employees of major state-owned enterprises to go on strike. The situation was so tense that residents reportedly began a bank run and resorted to panic-buying.\n\nIn the wake of the United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade on May 7, 1999, protests broke out throughout China, including in Wuhan.On June 22, 2000, a Wuhan Airlines flight from Enshi to Wuhan was forced to circle for 30 minutes due to thunderstorms. The aircraft eventually crashed on the banks of Han River in Hanyang District, all on-board perished (there were varying accounts of number of crews and passengers). In addition, the crash also killed 7 people on the ground.Chinese protesters organized boycotts of the French-owned retail chain Carrefour in major Chinese cities including Kunming, Hefei and Wuhan, accusing the French nation of pro-secessionist conspiracy and anti-Chinese racism. The BBC reported that hundreds of people demonstrated in Beijing, Wuhan, Hefei, Kunming and Qingdao. On May 19, 2011, Fang Binxing, the Principal of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (also known as \"Father of China's Great Fire Wall\") was hit on the chest by a shoe thrown at him by a Huazhong University of Science and Technology student who calls herself \"hanjunyi\" (\u5bd2\u541b\u4f9d, or \u5c0f\u6e56\u5317) while Fang was giving a lecture at Wuhan University.The city has been subject to devastating floods, which are now supposed to be controlled by the ambitious Three Gorges Dam, a project which was completed in 2008. The 2008 Chinese winter storms damaged water supply equipment in Wuhan: up to 100,000 people were out of running water when several water pipes burst, cutting the supply to local households. The 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat wave hit Wuhan on July 3.\nIn the 2010 China floods, the Han River at Wuhan experienced its worst flooding in twenty years, as officials continued sandbagging efforts along the Han and Yangtze Rivers in the city and checked reservoirs. In the 2011 China floods, Wuhan was flooded, with parts of the city losing power. In the 2016 China floods, Wuhan saw 570 mm (22 in) of rainfall during the first week of July, surpassing the record that fell on the city in 1991. A red alert for heavy rainfall was issued on 2 July, the same day that eight people died after a 15-meter (49 ft) section of a 2 m (6.6 ft) tall wall collapsed on top of them. The city's subway system, the Wuhan Metro was partially submerged as was the main railway station. At least 14 city residents were killed, one was missing, and more than 80,000 were relocated.In early July 2019, there were protests against plans for a new incinerator in Xinzhou District.The 2019 Military World Games were hosted in Wuhan in October.\nIn December 2019, an epidemic of a new coronavirus disease began in Wuhan. The disease, which became known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), spread and developed into the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Wuhan and other Hubei cities were placed under lockdown for nearly three months to contain the disease. On April 8, 2020, the Wuhan lockdown officially came to an end after no new domestic cases were reported in Hubei province.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Overview ===\n\nWuhan is in east-central Hubei, at latitude 29\u00b0 58'\u201331\u00b0 22' N and longitude 113\u00b0 41'\u2013115\u00b0 05' E. Wuhan sits at the confluence of the Han River flowing into the Yangtze River at the East of the Jianghan Plain along the Yangtze's middle reaches.\nThe metropolitan area comprises three parts\u2014Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang\u2014commonly called the \"Three Towns of Wuhan\" (hence the name \"Wuhan\", combining \"Wu\" from the first city and \"Han\" from the other two). The consolidation of these cities occurred in 1927 and Wuhan was thereby established. The three former cities face each other across the rivers and are linked by bridges, including one of the first modern bridges in China, known as the \"First Bridge\".\n\nWuchang lies South East of the Yangtze River that separates it from both Hankou and Hanyang.\nHankou sits North of the Yangtze River separating it from Wuchang. Hankou is North of the Han River separating it from Hanyang.\nHanyang lies West of the Yangtze separating it from Wuchang. Hanyang is south of the Han river separating it from Hankou.\nIt is simple in terrain \u2014 low and flat in the middle and hilly in the south, with the Yangtze and Han rivers winding through the city. The She River enters the Yangtze in Huangpi District. Wuhan occupies a land area of 8,494.41 square kilometers (3,279.71 sq mi), most of which is alluvial plain and decorated with hills and a great number of lakes and ponds. Water makes up one quarter of Wuhan's urban territory, which is the highest percentage among  major cities in China. Wuhan has nearly 200 lakes, including the East Lake of 33 km2, and Tangxun Lake, which are the largest lakes entirely within a city in China.Other well-known lakes include South Lake and Sand Lake.

Wuhan Railway Hub is considered one of the four key railway hubs of China. The city of Wuhan is served by three major railway stations: the Hankou Railway Station in Hankou, the Wuchang Railway Station in Wuchang, and the Wuhan Railway Station, located in a newly developed area east of the East Lake (Hongshan District). As the stations are many miles apart, it is important for passengers to be aware of the particular station(s) used by a particular train.\nThe (original) Hankou Station was the terminus for the Jinghan Railway from Beijing, while the Wuchang Station was the terminus for the Yuehan Railway to Guangzhou. Since the construction of the First Yangtze Bridge and the linking of the two lines into the Jingguang Railway, both Hankou and Wuchang stations have been served by trains going to all directions, which contrasts with the situation in such cities as New York or Moscow, where different stations serve different directions.\nWith the opening of the Hefei-Wuhan high-speed railway on April 1, 2009, Wuhan became served by high-speed trains with Hefei, Nanjing, and Shanghai; several trains a day now connect the city with Shanghai, getting there in under 6 hours. As of early 2010, most of these express trains leave from the Hankou Railway Station.\n\nIn 2006, construction began on the new Wuhan Railway Station with 11 platforms, located on the northeastern outskirts of the city. In December 2009, the station was opened, as China unveiled its second high-speed train with scheduled runs from Guangzhou to Wuhan. Billed as the fastest train in the world, it can reach a speed of 394 km/h (244.82 mph). The travel time between the two cities has been reduced from ten and a half hours to just three. The rail service has been extended north to Beijing.As of 2011, the new Wuhan Railway Station is primarily used by the Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed trains, while most regular trains to other destinations continue to use the Hankou and Wuchang stations.\n\nConstruction work is carried out on several lines of the new Wuhan Metropolitan Area Intercity Railway, which will eventually connect Wuhan's three main rail terminals with several stations throughout the city's outer areas and farther suburbs, as well as with the nearby cities of Xianning, Huangshi, Huanggang, and Xiaogan. The first line of the system, the one to Xianning, opened for passenger operations at the end of 2013. The line to Xiaogen opened on 1 December 2016 and it was extended with the opening of the Wuhan\u2013Shiyan high-speed railway to Shiyan on 29 November 2019.The main freight railway station and classification yard of the Wuhan metropolitan area is the extensive Wuhan North railway station, with 112 tracks and over 650 switches. It is located in Hengdian Subdistrict of Huangpi District, located 20 km (12 mi) north of the Wuhan Station and 23 km (14 mi) from Hankou Station.\n\n\n=== Wuhan Metro ===\n\nWuhan Metro is a rapid transit system serving the city of Wuhan.

Line 2 opened on 28 December 2012 and is the first underground metro line crossing the Yangtze River. With 1.22 billion annual passengers in 2019, Wuhan Metro is the sixth-busiest rapid transit system in mainland China. There are a number of lines or sections under construction. The government of Wuhan City promised the citizens that at least two lines or sections open every year. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire network was out of service from 23 January to 27 March 2020.\n\n\n=== Trams ===\n\nTrams were brought to the streets of Wuhan on July 28, 2017 with the first line (Auto-city T1 Line) opened that day. The trams under construction or planning in Wuhan are:\n\nAuto-city trams, with Lines T1, T2, T6, and T8 in the Wuhan Economic Development Area, in the far western reaches on Hanyang. T1 Line is operational as of 2017.\nOptics Valley trams, two lines  (T1 and T2) south and east of Guanggu Circle (Guanggu Guangchang) in southeastern Wuchang.

In 2012 the Wuhan and Hangzhou Public Bicycle programs in China are the largest in the world, with around 90,000 and 60,000 bicycles respectively. China has seen a rise in private \"dockless\" bike shares with fleets that dwarf systems in size outside China. Initially, a number of traditional (third generation) docked public bike systems operated by local municipal governments opened across China, with the largest ones being in Wuhan and Hangzhou.  The first was introduced in Beijing in 2007.  However, third generation bike sharing is not considered successful for the majority cities in China.  Bike sharing in Beijing virtually stopped and it also has encountered difficulties in Shanghai and Wuhan.\n\n\n== Destinations ==\n\nThe Yellow Crane Tower (Huanghelou) is presumed to have been first built in approximately 220 AD.

The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also called the First Bridge, was built over the Yangtze in 1957, carrying a railroad directly across the river between hills known as Snake Hill and Turtle Hill. Before this bridge was built it could take up to an entire day to barge railcars across. Including its approaches, it is 5,511 feet (1,680 m) long, and it accommodates both a double-track railway on a lower deck and a four-lane roadway above. It was built with the assistance of advisers from the Soviet Union.\nThe Second Bridge, a cable-stayed bridge built of prestressed concrete, has a central span of 400 meters (1,300 feet); it is 4,678 meters (15,348 feet) in length (including 1,877 meters (6,158 feet) of the main bridge) and 26.5 to 33.5 meters (86.9 to 109.9 feet) in width. Its main bridgeheads are 90 meters (300 feet) high each, pulling 392 thick slanting cables together in the shape of double fans so that the central span of the bridge is well poised on the piers and the bridge's stability and vibration resistance are ensured. With six lanes on the deck, the bridge is designed to handle the daily passage of 50,000 motor vehicles. The bridge was completed in 1995.\n\nThe Third Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also called Baishazhou Bridge, was completed in September 2000. Located 8.6 kilometers (5.3 miles) southwest of the First Bridge, construction of Baishazhou Bridge started in 1997. With an investment of over 1.4 billion yuan (about US$170,000,000), the bridge, which is 3,586 meters (11,765 feet) long and 26.5 meters (86.9 feet) wide, has six lanes and has a capacity of 50,000 vehicles a day. The bridge is expected to serve as a major passage for the future Wuhan Ring Road, greatly easing the city's traffic and aiding local economic development.\nThe Yangluo Bridge carries Wuhan's Ring Road across the Yangtze in the city's eastern suburbs (connecting the Hongshan District with the Xinzhou District). It was opened on December 26, 2007.\nThe Wuhan Tianxingzhou Yangtze River Bridge crosses the Yangtze in the northeastern part of the city, downstream of the Second bridge. It is named after Tianxing Island (Tianxingzhou), above which it crosses the river. Built at a cost of 11 billion yuan, the 4,657-meter cable suspension bridge was opened on December 26, 2009, in time for the opening of the Wuhan Railway Station. It is a combined road and rail bridge, and carries the Wuhan\u2013Guangzhou High-Speed Railway across the river.\n\n\n=== Skyscrapers ===\n\nThe Yellow Crane Tower, historically one of the tallest buildings in Wuhan, is considered one of the Four Great Towers of China and was destroyed twelve times, both by warfare and by fire. The tower is classified as an AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration. At 438 meters (1,437 ft) in height, the Wuhan Center skyscraper, the tallest structure in Wuhan and in Central China, is the eighth tallest structure in China. The Minsheng Bank Building, the second tallest structure in Wuhan, was the tallest building in Wuhan when it was completed in 2007. It retained the title until Wuhan Center surpassed it in 2014. Wuhan World Trade Tower is a 273-meter (896 foot) tall skyscraper located in Wuhan. It became the tallest building in Wuhan after its completion in 1998. However, it was surpassed by the Minsheng Bank Building in 2007.\nThe Wuhan Greenland Center is a planned 636-meter (2,087 ft), 126-floor mixed-use skyscraper currently under construction and scheduled for completion in 2019. If completed as planned, it will be among the world's tallest structures, and one of the world's tallest buildings by occupiable floor height. The Phoenix Towers are proposed supertall skyscrapers planned for construction in Wuhan. At 1 kilometer (3,300 ft) high, the towers would also be among the tallest structures in the world when completed.\n\n\n== Notable Wuhanese ==\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nLi Yuanhong \u2013 former President of the Republic of China (1916\u201317, 1922\u201323).\nWu Yi \u2013 former Vice-Premier and Minister of Health of the People's Republic of China\n\n\n=== Business ===\nWei Brian - Chinese entrepreneur\n\n\n=== Science ===\nChang-Lin Tien \u2013 seventh Chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley (1990\u20131997) and a major founder of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering (NAE).

        "wiki": "Nanjing (listen), alternatively romanized as Nanking and Nankin, is the capital of Jiangsu province of the People's Republic of China and the second largest city in the East China region, with 11 districts, an administrative area of 6,600 km2 (2,500 sq mi) and a total population of 8,505,500 as of 2019. The inner area of Nanjing enclosed by the city wall is Nanjing City (\u5357\u4eac\u57ce).\nSituated in the Yangtze River Delta region, Nanjing has a prominent place in Chinese history and culture, having served as the capital of various Chinese dynasties, kingdoms and republican governments dating from the 3rd century to 1949, and has thus long been a major center of culture, education, research, politics, economy, transport networks and tourism, being the home to one of the world's largest inland ports. The city is also one of the fifteen sub-provincial cities in the People's Republic of China's administrative structure, enjoying jurisdictional and economic autonomy only slightly less than that of a province. Nanjing has been ranked seventh in the evaluation of \"Cities with Strongest Comprehensive Strength\" issued by the National Statistics Bureau, and second in the evaluation of cities with most sustainable development potential in the Yangtze River Delta. It has also been awarded the title of 2008 Habitat Scroll of Honor of China, Special UN Habitat Scroll of Honor Award and National Civilized City.Nanjing has many high-quality universities and research institutes, with the number of universities listed in 100 National Key Universities ranking third, including Nanjing University which has a long history and is among the world top 10 universities ranked by Nature Index. The ratio of college students to total population ranks No.1 among large cities nationwide. Nanjing is one of the top three Chinese scientific research centers, according to the Nature Index, especially strong in the chemical sciences.\nNanjing, one of the nation's most important cities for over a thousand years, is recognized as one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China. It has been one of the world's largest cities, enjoying peace and prosperity despite wars and disasters. Nanjing served as the capital of Eastern Wu (229\u2013280), one of the three major states in the Three Kingdoms period; the Eastern Jin and each of the Southern dynasties (Liu Song, Southern Qi, Liang and Chen), which successively ruled southern China from 317\u2013589; the Southern Tang (937\u201375), one of the Ten Kingdoms; the Ming dynasty when, for the first time, all of China was ruled from the city (1368\u20131421); and the Republic of China under the nationalist Kuomintang (1927\u201337, 1946\u201349) prior to its flight to Taiwan by Chiang Kai-Shek during the Chinese Civil War. The city also served as the seat of the rebel Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (1853\u201364) and the Japanese puppet regime of Wang Jingwei (1940\u201345) during the Second Sino-Japanese War. It suffered severe atrocities in both conflicts, such as the Nanjing massacre.\nNanjing has served as the capital city of Jiangsu province since the establishment of the People's Republic of China. It has many important heritage sites, including the Presidential Palace and Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. Nanjing is famous for human historical landscapes, mountains and waters such as Fuzimiao, Ming Palace, Chaotian Palace, Porcelain Tower, Drum Tower, Stone City, City Wall, Qinhuai River, Xuanwu Lake and Purple Mountain. Key cultural facilities include Nanjing Library, Nanjing Museum and Nanjing Art Museum.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe city has a number of other names, and some historical names are now used as names of districts of the city; among them there is the name Jiangning or Kiangning (\u6c5f\u5be7), whose former character Jiang (\u6c5f, Yangtze) is the former part of the name Jiangsu and latter character Ning (\u5be7, simplified form \u5b81; 'Peace') is the short name of Nanjing. When it was the capital of China, for instance under the ROC, Jing (\u4eac; 'Capital') was adopted as the abbreviation of Nanjing.\nThe city first became a Chinese national capital as early as the Jin dynasty. The name Nanjing, which means \"Southern Capital\", was officially designated for the city during the Ming dynasty, about six hundred years later. Nanjing is sometimes known as Jinling or Ginling (\u91d1\u9675, \"Gold Hill\") of the eponymous Ginling College; the old name has been used since the Warring States period in the Zhou dynasty.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history and foundation ===\n\nArchaeological discovery shows that \"Nanjing Man\" lived more than 500 thousand years ago. Zun, a kind of wine vessel, was found to exist in Beiyinyangying culture of Nanjing in about 5000 years ago. In the late period of Shang dynasty, Taibo of Zhou came to Jiangnan and established Wu state, and the first stop is in Nanjing area according to some historians based on discoveries in Taowu and Hushu culture. According to a legend quoted by an artist in Ming dynasty, Chen Yi, Fuchai, King of the State of Wu, founded a fort named Yecheng in today's Nanjing area in 495 BC. Later in 473 BC, the State of Yue conquered Wu and constructed the fort of Yuecheng (\u8d8a\u57ce) on the outskirts of the present-day Zhonghua Gate. In 333 BC, after eliminating the State of Yue, the State of Chu built Jinling Yi (\u91d1\u9675\u9091) in the western part of present-day Nanjing. It was renamed Moling (\u79e3\u9675) during the reign of the First Emperor of Qin. Since then, the city experienced destruction and renewal many times. The area was successively part of Kuaiji, Zhang and Danyang prefectures in Qin and Han dynasty, and part of Yangzhou region which was established as the nation's 13 supervisory and administrative regions in the 5th year of Yuanfeng in Han dynasty (106 BC). Nanjing was later the capital city of Danyang Prefecture, and had been the capital city of Yangzhou for about 400 years from late Han to early Tang.\n\n\n=== Capital of the Six Dynasties ===\n\nNanjing first became a state capital in AD 229, when the state of Eastern Wu founded by Sun Quan during the Three Kingdoms period relocated its capital to Jianye (\u5efa\u696d), the city extended on the basis of Jinling Yi in AD 211. Although conquered by the Western Jin dynasty in 280, Nanjing and its neighboring areas had been well cultivated, developing into one of the commercial, cultural and political centers of China during the Eastern Wu. This city would soon play a vital role in the following centuries.\nShortly after the unification of the region, the Western Jin dynasty collapsed. First the rebellions by eight Jin princes for the throne and later rebellions and invasion from Xiongnu and other nomadic peoples that destroyed the rule of the Jin dynasty in the north. In 317, remnants of the Jin court, as well as nobles and wealthy families, fled from the north to the south and reestablished the Jin court in Nanjing, which was then called Jiankang (\u5efa\u5eb7), replacing Luoyang. This marked the first time a Chinese dynastic capital moved to southern China.\n\nDuring the period of North\u2013South division, Nanjing remained the capital of the Southern dynasties for more than two and a half centuries. During this time, Nanjing was the international hub of East Asia. Based on historical documents, the city had 280,000 registered households. Assuming an average Nanjing household consisted of about 5.1 people, the city had more than 1.4 million residents.A number of sculptural ensembles of that era, erected at the tombs of royals and other dignitaries, have survived (in various degrees of preservation) in Nanjing's northeastern and eastern suburbs, primarily in Qixia and Jiangning District. Possibly the best preserved of them is the ensemble of the Tomb of Xiao Xiu (475\u2013518), a brother of Emperor Wu of Liang.Six Dynasties is a collective term for six Chinese dynasties mentioned above which all maintained national capitals at Jiankang. The six dynasties were: Eastern Wu (222\u2013280), Eastern Jin dynasty (317\u2013420) and four southern dynasties (420\u2013589).\n\n\n=== Destruction and revival ===\n\nThe period of division ended when the Sui dynasty reunified China and almost destroyed the entire city, turning it into a small town. The city was razed after the Sui took it over. It was renamed Shengzhou (\u6607\u5dde) in the Tang dynasty and resuscitated during the late Tang.It was chosen as the capital and called Jinling (\u91d1\u9675) during the Southern Tang (937\u2013976), which succeeded the state of Yang Wu. It was renamed Jiangning (\u6c5f\u5be7) in the Northern Song and renamed Jiankang in the Southern Song. Jiankang's textile industry burgeoned and thrived during the Song despite the constant threat of foreign invasions from the north by the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty. The court of Da Chu, a short-lived puppet state established by the Jurchens, and the court of Song were once in the city.The Southern Song were eventually exterminated by the Mongols; during their rule as the Yuan dynasty, the city's status as a hub of the textile industry was further consolidated. According to Odoric of Pordenone, Chilenfu (Nanjing) had 360 stone bridges, which were finer than anywhere else in the world. It was well populated and had a large craft industry.\n\n\n=== Southern capital of Ming dynasty ===\n\nThe first emperor of the Ming dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang (the Hongwu Emperor), who overthrew the Yuan dynasty, renamed the city Yingtian (\u61c9\u5929), rebuilt it, and made it the dynastic capital in 1368. He constructed a 48 km (30 mi) long city wall around Yingtian, as well as a new Ming Palace complex, and government halls. It took 200,000 laborers 21 years to finish the wall, which was intended to defend the city and its surrounding region from coastal pirates. The present-day City Wall of Nanjing was mainly built during that time and today it remains in good condition and has been well preserved. It is among the longest surviving city walls in China. The Jianwen Emperor ruled from 1398 to 1402.\n\nIt is believed that Nanjing was the largest city in the world from 1358 to 1425 with a population of 487,000 in 1400. In 1421, the Yongle Emperor relocated the capital to Beijing. The city began to be called the 'southern capital' \u2013 Nanjing (\u5357\u4eac), in comparison to the capital in the north. His successor, the Hongxi Emperor, wished to revert the relocation of the imperial capital from Nanjing to Beijing that had happened during the Yongle reign. On 24 February 1425, he appointed Admiral Zheng He as the defender of Nanjing and ordered him to continue his command over the Ming treasure fleet for the city's defense.  Zheng He governed the city with three eunuchs for internal matters and two military noblemen for external matters, awaiting the Hongxi Emperor's return along with the military establishment from the north. The emperor died on 29 May 1425 before this could have taken place, so Beijing remained the de facto capital and Nanjing remained the secondary capital. The succeeding Xuande Emperor remained in Beijing, so the aforementioned Nanjing government eventually became a permanent institution. In official Ming documents of 1425 to 1441, Nanjing was designated as the capital and Beijing was designated as the temporary capital. In 1441, Emperor Yingzong ordered to not to prefix the word \"provisional\" (\u884c\u5728) on the Beijing Government seals any longer, while Nanjing's need to prefix \"Nanjing\" for distinguishing purposes remained. Hence, Nanjing still had itself imperial government with extremely limited power before 1644.\nBesides the city wall, other Ming-era structures in the city included the famous Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum and Porcelain Tower, although the latter was destroyed by the Taipings in the 19th century either to prevent a hostile faction from using it to observe and shell the city or from superstitious fear of its geomantic properties.A monument to the huge human cost of some of the gigantic construction projects of the early Ming dynasty is the Yangshan Quarry (located some 15\u201320 km (9\u201312 mi) east of the walled city and Ming Xiaoling mausoleum), where a gigantic stele, cut on the orders of the Yongle Emperor, lies abandoned, just as it was left 600 years ago when it was understood it was impossible to move or complete it.As the center of the empire, early-Ming Nanjing had worldwide connections. It was home of the admiral Zheng He, who went to sail the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and it was visited by foreign dignitaries, such as a king from Borneo (\u6e24\u6ce5; B\u00f3n\u00ed), who died during his visit to China in 1408. The Tomb of the King of Boni, with a spirit way and a tortoise stele, was discovered in Yuhuatai District (south of the walled city) in 1958, and has been restored.Over two centuries after the removal of the capital to Beijing, Nanjing was destined to become the capital of a Ming emperor one more time. After the fall of Beijing to Li Zicheng's rebel forces and then to the Manchu-led Qing dynasty in the spring of 1644, the Ming prince Zhu Yousong was enthroned in Nanjing in June 1644 as the Hongguang Emperor. His short reign was described by later historians as the first reign of the so-called Southern Ming dynasty.\n\nZhu Yousong, however, fared a lot worse than his ancestor Zhu Yuanzhang three centuries earlier. Beset by factional conflicts, his regime could not offer effective resistance to Qing forces, when the Qing army, led by the Manchu prince Dodo approached Jiangnan the next spring. Days after Yangzhou fell to the Manchus in late May 1645, the Hongguang Emperor fled Nanjing, and the imperial Ming Palace was looted by local residents. On June 6, Dodo's troops approached Nanjing, and the commander of the city's garrison, Zhao the Earl of Xincheng, promptly surrendered the city to them. The Manchus soon ordered all male residents of the city to shave their heads in the Manchu queue way. They requisitioned a large section of the city for the bannermen's cantonment, and occupied the former imperial Ming Palace, but otherwise the city was spared the mass murders and destruction that befell Yangzhou.Despite capturing many counties in his initial attack due to surprise and having the initiative, Koxinga announced the final battle in Nanjing in 1659 ahead of time giving plenty of time for the Qing to prepare because he wanted a decisive, single grand showdown like his father succsfully did against the Dutch at the Battle of Liaoluo Bay, throwing away the surprise and initiative which led to its failure. Koxinga's attack on Qing held Nanjing which would interrupt the supply route of the Grand Canal leading to possible starvation in Beijing caused such fear that the Manchus (Tartares) considered returning to Manchuria (Tartary) and abandoning China according to a 1671 account by a French missionary. The commoners and officials in Beijing and Nanjing were waiting to support whichever side won. An official from Qing Beijing sent letters to family and another official in Nanjing, telling them all communication and news from Nanjing to Beijing had been cut off, that the Qing were considering abandoning Beijing and moving their capital far away to a remote location for safety since Koxinga's iron troops were rumored to be invincible. The letter said it reflected the grim situation being felt in Qing Beijing. The official told his children in Nanjing to prepare to defect to Koxinga which he himself was preparing to do. Koxinga's forces intercepted these letters and after reading them Koxinga may have started to regret his deliberate delays allowing the Qing to prepare for a final massive battle instead of swiftly attacking Nanjing. Koxinga's Ming loyalists fought against a majority Han Chinese Bannermen Qing army when attacking Nanjing.  The siege lasted almost three weeks, beginning on August 24.  Koxinga's forces were unable to maintain a complete encirclement, which enabled the city to obtain supplies and even reinforcements\u2014though cavalry attacks by the city's forces were successful even before reinforcements arrived.  Koxinga's forces were defeated and \"slipped back\" (Wakeman's phrase) to the ships which had brought them.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty and Taiping Rebellion ===\n\nUnder the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911), the Nanjing area was known as Jiangning and served as the seat of government for the Viceroy of Liangjiang. It was the site of a Qing Army garrison. It had been visited by the Kangxi and Qianlong emperors a number of times on their tours of the southern provinces. Nanjing was threatened to be invaded by British troops during the close of the First Opium War, which was ended by the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. As the capital of the brief-lived rebel Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in the mid-19th century, Nanjing was known as Tianjing (\u5929\u4eac; '\"Heavenly Capital\" or \"Capital of Heaven\"'). The rebellion destroyed most of the former Ming imperial buildings in the city, including the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing.\nBoth the Qing viceroy and the Taiping king resided in buildings that would later be known as the Presidential Palace. When Qing forces led by Zeng Guofan retook the city in 1864, a massive slaughter occurred in the city with over 100,000 estimated to have committed suicide or fought to the death. Since the Taiping Rebellion began, Qing forces allowed no rebels speaking its dialect to surrender. This systematic mass murder of civilians occurred in Nanjing.The New York Methodist Mission Society's Superintendent, Virgil Hart arrived in Nanking in 1881. After some time, he eventually thwarted its officials by buying a piece of property near the South Gate and Confucius Temple; to build the city's first Methodist Church, western hospital (Blackstone Methodist Hospital) and Boys' School. The hospital would later be unified with the Drum Tower Hospital and the Boys' School would be expanded by later Missionaries to become the University of Nanking and Medical School. The old Mission property would become the No. 13 Middle School, the city's oldest/continuous school grounds in the city.\n\n\n=== Capital of the republic and Nanking Massacre ===\n\nThe Xinhai Revolution led to the founding of the Republic of China in January 1912 with Sun Yat-sen as the first provisional president and Nanjing was selected as its new capital. However, the Qing Empire controlled large regions to the north, so revolutionaries asked Yuan Shikai to replace Sun as president in exchange for the abdication of Puyi, the last emperor. Yuan demanded the capital be Beijing (closer to his power base).\nIn 1927, the Kuomintang (KMT; Nationalist Party) under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek again established Nanjing as the capital of the Republic of China, and this became internationally recognized once KMT forces took Beijing in 1928. The following decade is known as the Nanking decade. During this decade, Nanjing was of symbolic and strategic importance. The Ming dynasty had made Nanjing a capital, the republic had been established there in 1912, and Sun Yat-sen's provisional government had been there. Sun's body was brought and placed in a grand mausoleum to cement Chiang's legitimacy. Chiang was born in the neighboring province of Zhejiang and the general area had strong popular support for him.\n\nIn 1927, the Nationalist government proposed a comprehensive planning proposal, the Capital Plan (\u9996\u90fd\u8a08\u5283), to reconstruct the war-torn city of Nanjing into a modern capital. It was a decade of extraordinary growth with an enormous amount of construction. A lot of government buildings, residential houses, and modern public infrastructures were built. During this boom, Nanjing reputedly became one of the most modern cities in China.\nIn 1937, the Empire of Japan started a full-scale invasion of China after invading Manchuria in 1931, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War (often considered a theater of World War II). Their troops occupied Nanjing in December and carried out the systematic and brutal Nanking massacre (the \"Rape of Nanking\"). Even children, the elderly, and nuns are reported to have suffered at the hands of the Imperial Japanese Army. The total death toll, including estimates made by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal after the atomic bombings, was between 300,000 and 350,000. The city itself was also severely damaged during the massacre. The Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall was built in 1985 to commemorate this event.\nA few days before the fall of the city, the National Government of China was relocated to the southwestern city Chungking (Chongqing) and resumed Chinese resistance. In 1940, a Japanese-collaborationist government known as the \"Nanjing Regime\" or \"Reorganized National Government of China\" led by Wang Jingwei was established in Nanjing as a rival to Chiang Kai-shek's government in Chongqing. In 1946, after the Surrender of Japan, the KMT relocated its central government back to Nanjing.\n\n\n=== Chinese Civil War and People's Republic ===\n \nOn 21 April 1949, Communist forces crossed the Yangtze River. On April 23, the Communist People's Liberation Army (PLA) captured Nanjing. The KMT government retreated to Canton (Guangzhou) until October 15, Chongqing until November 25, and then Chengdu before retreating to the island of Taiwan on December 10 where Taipei was proclaimed the temporary capital of the Republic of China. By late 1949, the PLA was pursuing remnants of KMT forces southwards in southern China, and only Tibet and Hainan Island were left. \nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic of China in October 1949, Nanjing was initially a province-level municipality, but it was soon merged into Jiangsu and again became the provincial capital by replacing Zhenjiang which was transferred in 1928, and retains that status to this day.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nNanjing, with a total land area of 6,598 km2 (2,548 sq mi), is situated in the heartland of the drainage area of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and in the Yangtze River Delta, one of the largest economic zones of China. The Yangtze River flows past the west side and then the north side of Nanjing City, while the Ningzheng Ridge surrounds the north, east and south sides of the city. The city is 650 km (400 mi) southeast of Luoyang, 900 km (560 mi) south-southeast of Beijing, 270 km (170 mi) west-northwest of Shanghai, and 1,200 km (750 mi) east-northeast of Chongqing. The Yangtze River flows downstream from Jiujiang, Jiangxi, through Anhui and Jiangsu to the East China Sea. The northern part of the lower Yangtze drainage basin is the Huai River basin and the southern part is the Zhe River basin; they are connected by the Grand Canal east of Nanjing. The area around Nanjing is called Xiajiang (\u4e0b\u6c5f, Downstream River) region, with Jianghuai dominant in the northern part and Jiangzhe dominant in the southern part. The region is also well known as Dongnan (\u4e1c\u5357, South East, the Southeast) and Jiangnan (\u6c5f\u5357, and River South, South of Yangtze).Nanjing borders Yangzhou to the northeast (one town downstream when following the north bank of the Yangtze); Zhenjiang to the east (one town downstream when following the south bank of the Yangtze); and Changzhou to the southeast. On its western boundary is Anhui, where Nanjing borders five prefecture-level cities: Chuzhou to the northwest, Wuhu, Chaohu and Ma'anshan to the west and Xuancheng to the southwest.Nanjing is at the intersection of the Yangtze River, an east\u2013west water transport artery, and the Nanjing\u2013Beijing railway, a north\u2013south land transport artery, hence the name \u201cdoor of the east and west, throat of the south and north\u201d. Furthermore, the west part of the Ningzhen range is in Nanjing; the Loong-like Zhong Mountain curls round the east side of the city, while the tiger-like Stone Mountain crouches in the west of the city, hence the name \u201cthe Zhong Mountain, a dragon curling, and the Stone Mountain, a tiger crouching\u201d.\n\n\n=== Climate and environment ===\n\nNanjing has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) and is influenced by the East Asian monsoon. The four seasons are distinct, with damp conditions seen throughout the year, very hot and muggy summers, cold, damp winters, and in between, spring and autumn are of reasonable length. Along with Chongqing and Wuhan, Nanjing is traditionally referred to as one of the \"Three Furnaces\" along the Yangtze River for the perennially high temperatures in the summertime. However, the time from mid-June to the end of July is the plum blossom blooming season in which the meiyu (rainy season of East Asia; literally \"plum rain\") occurs, during which the city experiences a period of mild rain as well as dampness. Typhoons are uncommon but possible in the late stages of summer and early part of autumn. The annual mean temperature is around 15.91 \u00b0C (60.6 \u00b0F), with the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranging from 2.7 \u00b0C (36.9 \u00b0F) in January to 28.1 \u00b0C (82.6 \u00b0F) in July. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221214.0 \u00b0C (7 \u00b0F) on 6 January 1955 to 40.7 \u00b0C (105 \u00b0F) on 22 August 1959. On average precipitation falls 115 days out of the year, and the average annual rainfall is 1,090 mm (43 in). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 37 percent in March to 52 percent in August, the city receives 1,926 hours of bright sunshine annually.\nNanjing is endowed with rich natural resources, which include more than 40 kinds of minerals. Among them, iron and sulfur reserves make up 40 percent of those of Jiangsu province. Its reserves of strontium rank first in East Asia and the South East Asia region. Nanjing also possesses abundant water resources, both from the Yangtze River and groundwater. In addition, it has several natural hot springs such as Tangshan Hot Spring in Jiangning and Tangquan Hot Spring in Pukou.\n\nSun Yat-sen once summarized and lauded the feature of Nanjing in his book The International Development of China (\u5efa\u570b\u65b9\u7565):Nanking was the old capital of China before Peking, and is situated in a fine locality which comprises high mountains, deep water and a vast level plain\u2014a rare site to be found in any part of the world. It also lies at the center of a very rich country on both sides of the lower Yangtze. (\u5357\u4eac\u70ba\u4e2d\u570b\u53e4\u90fd\uff0c\u5728\u5317\u4eac\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e43\u5728\u4e00\u7f8e\u5584\u4e4b\u5730\u5340\u3002\u5176\u5730\u6709\u9ad8\u5c71\uff0c\u6709\u6df1\u6c34\uff0c\u6709\u5e73\u539f\uff0c\u6b64\u4e09\u7a2e\u5929\u5de5\uff0c\u9418\u6bd3\u4e00\u8655\uff0c\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u4e4b\u5927\u90fd\u5e02\u8aa0\u96e3\u8993\u5982\u6b64\u4f73\u5883\u4e5f\u3002\u800c\u53c8\u6070\u5c45\u9577\u6c5f\u4e0b\u6e38\u5169\u5cb8\u6700\u8c50\u5bcc\u5340\u57df\u4e4b\u4e2d\u5fc3...)To be more exact, surrounded by the Yangtze River and mountains, the urban area of the city enjoys its scenic natural environment. Xuanwu Lake and Mochou Lake are located in the center of the city and are easily accessible to the public, while Purple Mountain is covered with deciduous and coniferous forests preserving various historical and cultural sites. Meanwhile, a Yangtze River deep-water channel is under construction to enable Nanjing to handle the navigation of 50,000 DWT vessels from the East China Sea.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Environmental issues ===\n\n\n==== Air pollution in 2013 ====\nA dense wave of smog began in the central and east parts of China on 2 December 2013 across a distance of around 1,200 km (750 mi), including Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai and Zhejiang. A lack of cold air flow, combined with slow-moving air masses carrying industrial emissions, collected airborne pollutants to form a thick layer of smog over the region. The heavy smog heavily polluted central and southern Jiangsu Province, especially in and around Nanjing, with its AQI pollution Index at \"severely polluted\" for five straight days and \"heavily polluted\" for nine. On 3 December 2013, levels of PM2.5 particulate matter average over 943 micrograms per cubic meter, falling to over 338 micrograms per cubic meter on 4 December 2013. Between 3:00 pm, 3 December and 2:00 pm, 4 December local time, several expressways from Nanjing to other Jiangsu cities were closed, stranding dozens of passenger buses in Zhongyangmen bus station. From 5 to 6 December, Nanjing issued a red alert for air pollution and closed down all kindergarten through middle schools. Children's Hospital outpatient services increased by 33 percent; general incidence of bronchitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections significantly increased. The smog dissipated 12 December. Officials blamed the dense pollution on lack of wind, automobile exhaust emissions under low air pressure, and coal-powered district heating system in north China. Prevailing winds blew low-hanging air masses of factory emissions (mostly SO2) towards China's east coast.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAt present, the full name of the government of Nanjing is \"People's Government of Nanjing City\" and the city is under the one-party rule of the CPC, with the CPC Nanjing Committee Secretary as the de facto governor of the city and the mayor as the executive head of the government working under the secretary.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nThe sub-provincial city of Nanjing is divided into 11 districts.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the time of the 2010 census, the total population of the City of Nanjing was 8.005 million. The OECD estimated the encompassing metropolitan area at the time as 11.7 million. Official statistics in 2011 estimated the city's population to be 8.11 million. The birth rate was 8.86 percent and the death rate was 6.88 percent. The urban area had a population of 6.47 million people. The sex ratio of the city population was 107.31 males to 100 females.As in most of eastern China, the official ethnic makeup of Nanjing is predominantly Han nationality (98.56 percent), with 50 other official ethnic groups. In 1999, 77,394 residents belonged to officially defined minorities, among which the vast majority (64,832) were Hui, contributing 83.76 percent to the minority population. The second and third largest minority groups were Manchu (2,311) and Zhuang (533). Most of the minority nationalities resided in Jianye District, comprising 9.13 percent of the district's population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Earlier development ===\n\nThere was a massive cultivating in the area of Nanjing from the Three Kingdoms period to Southern dynasties. The sparse population led to land as royal rewards were granted for rules\u2019 people. At first, the landless peasants benefited from it, then the senior officials and aristocratic families. Since large numbers of immigrants flooded into the area, reclamation was quite common in its remote parts, which promoted its agricultural development.\nThe craft industries, by contrast, had a faster growth. Especially the textiles section, there were about 200,000 craftsmen by the late Qing. Several dynasties established their imperial textiles bureaus in Nanjing. The Nanjing Brocade (\u5357\u4eac\u4e91\u9526) is their exquisite product as the cloth for the royal garments such as dragon robes. Meanwhile, the satins from Nanjing were called \"tribute satins\" (\"\u8d21\u7f0e\"), because they were usually paid as tribute to the monarchy. Besides, minting, papermaking, shipbuilding grew initially since the Three Kingdoms period. As Nanjing was the capital of the Ming dynasty, the industries further expanded, where both state-owned and numerous private businesses served the imperial court. Several place names in Nanjing remains witnessed them, such as Wangjinshi (\u7f51\u5dfe\u5e02, the market sells wangjin), Guyilang (\u4f30\u8863\u5eca, the corridor for garments bargain), Youfangqiao (\u6cb9\u574a\u6865, the bridge near an oil mill).\nMoreover, the trade in Nanjing was also flourishing. The Ming dynasty drawing Prosperous Nanjing (\u5357\u90fd\u7e41\u4f1a\u56fe\u5377; N\u00e1nd\u016b F\u00e1nhu\u00ec T\u00faju\u01cen) depicts a vivid market scene bustling with people and full of various sorts of shops. However, the economic developments were almost wiped out by the Taiping Rebellion's catastrophe.\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\n\nInto the first half of the twentieth century after the establishment of ROC, Nanjing gradually shifted from being a production hub towards being a heavy consumption city, mainly because of the rapid expansion of its wealthy population after Nanjing once again regained the political spotlight of China. A number of huge department stores such as Zhongyang Shangchang sprouted up, attracting merchants from all over China to sell their products in Nanjing. In 1933, the revenue generated by the food and entertainment industry in the city exceeded the sum of the output of the manufacturing and agriculture industry. One third of the city population worked in the service industry, .\nIn the 1950s after PRC was established by CPC, the government invested heavily in the city to build a series of state-owned heavy industries, as part of the national plan of rapid industrialization, converting it into a heavy industry production center of east China. Overenthusiastic in building a \u201cworld-class\u201d industrial city, the government also made many disastrous mistakes during development, such as spending hundreds of millions of yuan to mine for non-existent coal, resulting in negative economic growth in the late 1960s. From the 1960s to 1980s there were five pillar industries, namely, electronics, automobiles, petrochemical, iron and steel, and power, each with big state-owned firms. After the Reform and Opening recovering market economy, the state-owned enterprises found themselves incapable of competing with efficient multinational firms and local private firms, hence were either mired in heavy debt or forced into bankruptcy or privatization and this resulted in large numbers of laid-off workers who were technically not unemployed but effectively jobless.\n\n\n=== Today ===\n\nThe current economy of the city is basically newly developed based on the past. Service industries are dominating, accounting for about 60 percent of the GDP of the city, and financial industry, culture industry and tourism industry are top 3 of them. Industries of information technology, energy saving and environmental protection, new energy, smart power grid and intelligent equipment manufacturing have become pillar industries. Big civilian-run enterprise include Suning Commerce, Yurun, Sanpower, Fuzhong, Hiteker, 5stars, Jinpu, Tiandi, CTTQ Pharmaceutical, Nanjing Iron and Steel Company and Simcere Pharmaceutical. Big state-owned firms include Panda Electronics, Yangzi Petrochemical, Jinling Petrochemical, Nanjing Chemical, Jincheng Motors, Jinling Pharmaceutical, Chenguang and NARI. The city has also attracted foreign investment, multinational firms such as Siemens, Ericsson, Volkswagen, Iveco, A.O. Smith, and Sharp have established their lines, and a number of multinationals such as Ford, IBM, Lucent, Samsung and SAP established research center there. Many China-based leading firms such as Huawei, ZTE and Lenovo have key R&D institutes in the city. Nanjing is an industrial technology research and development hub, hosting many R&D centers and institutions, especially in areas of electronics technology, information technology, computer software, biotechnology and pharmaceutical technology and new material technology.\nIn recent years, Nanjing has been developing its economy, commerce, industry, as well as city construction. In 2013 the city's GDP was RMB 801 billion (3rd in Jiangsu), and GDP per capita (current price) was RMB 98,174(US$16041), an 11 percent increase from 2012. The average urban resident's disposable income was RMB 36,200, while the average rural resident's net income was RMB 14,513. The registered urban unemployment rate was 3.02 percent, lower than the national average (4.3 percent). Nanjing's Gross Domestic Product ranked 12th in 2013 in China, and its overall competence ranked 6th in mainland and 8th including Taiwan and Hong Kong in 2009.\nIndustrial zonesThere are a number of industrial zones in Nanjing.\n\nNanjing New and High-Tech Industry Development Zone\nNanjing Baixia Hi-Tech Industrial Zone\nNanjing Economic and Technological Development Zone\n\n\n== Transport ==\nNanjing is the transport hub in eastern China and the downstream Yangtze River area. Different means of transport constitute a three-dimensional transport system that includes land, water and air. As in most other Chinese cities, public transport is the dominant mode of travel for the majority of citizens. As from October 2014, Nanjing had four bridges and two tunnels over the Yangtze River, linking districts north of the river with the city center on the south bank.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nNanjing is an important railway hub in eastern China. It serves as rail junction for the Beijing-Shanghai (Jinghu) (which is itself composed of the old Jinpu and Huning Railways), Nanjing\u2013Tongling Railway (Ningtong), Nanjing\u2013Qidong (Ningqi), and the Nanjing-Xi'an (Ningxi) which encompasses the Hefei\u2013Nanjing Railway.\nNanjing is connected to the national high-speed railway network by Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-Speed Railway and Shanghai\u2013Wuhan\u2013Chengdu Passenger Dedicated Line, with several more high-speed rail lines under construction.\nAmong all 17 railway stations in Nanjing, passenger rail service is mainly provided by Nanjing Railway Station and Nanjing South Railway Station, while other stations like Nanjing West Railway Station, Zhonghuamen Railway Station and Xianlin Railway Station serve minor roles. Nanjing Railway Station was first built in 1968. On November 12, 1999, the station was burnt in a serious fire. Reconstruction of the station was finished on September 1, 2005. Nanjing South Railway Station, which is one of the 5 hub stations on Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-Speed Railway, has officially been claimed as the largest railway station in Asia and the second largest in the world in terms of GFA (Gross Floor Area). Construction of Nanjing South Station began on 10 January 2008. The station was opened for public service in 2011.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nAs an important regional hub in the Yangtze River Delta, Nanjing is well-connected by over 60 state and provincial highways to all parts of China.\nMotorways such as Hu\u2013Ning, Ning\u2013He, Ning\u2013Hang enable commuters to travel to Shanghai, Hefei, Hangzhou, and other important cities quickly and conveniently. Inside the city of Nanjing, there are 230 km (140 mi) of highways, with a highway coverage density of 3.38 kilometers per hundred square kilometers (5.44 mi/100 sq mi). The total road coverage density of the city is 112.56 kilometers per hundred square kilometers (181.15 mi/100 sq mi). The two artery roads in Nanjing are Zhongshan Road and Hanzhong. The two roads cross in the city center, Xinjiekou.\nExpressways {G+XXxx (National Express, \u56fd\u5bb6\u9ad8\u901f), S+XX (\u7701\u7ea7\u9ad8\u901f)}:\n\nG25 Changchun\u2013Shenzhen Expressway\nG36 Nanjing\u2013Luoyang Expressway\nG40 Shanghai\u2013Xi'an Expressway\nG42 Shanghai\u2013Chengdu Expressway\nG4211 Nanjing\u2013Wuhu Expressway, a spur of G42 that extends west to Wuhu, Anhui\nS55 Nanjing\u2013Gaochun\uff08Xuancheng\uff09 Expressway (\u5b81\u5ba3\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u673a\u573a\u9ad8\u901f)\nS38 Yanjiang Expressway (\u6cbf\u6c5f\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5e38\u5408\u9ad8\u901f)\nG2501 Nanjing Ring Expressway (\u65b0\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u8d8a\u9ad8\u901f)\nS001 Nanjing Ring Highway (\u65e7\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u516c\u8def)National Highway {G1xx (which starts from Beijing), G2xx (north-south), G3xx (west-east)}:\n\nChina National Highway 104\u2014motorists can either drive northwest to Beijing or south to Fuzhou, Fujian.\nChina National Highway 205\u2014motorists can either drive north to Shanhaiguan, Hebei or south to Shenzhen, Guangdong.\nChina National Highway 312\u2014motorists can either drive east to Shanghai or west to Khorgas, Xinjiang on the Kazakh border\nChina National Highway 328\u2014Nanjing is the western terminus of G328, which motorists can follow to Hai'an County in eastern Jiangsu\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nThe city also boasts an efficient public transport network, which mainly consists of bus, taxi and metro systems. The bus network, which is currently run by three companies since 2011, provides more than 370 routes covering all parts of the city and suburban areas. At present, the Nanjing Metro system has a grand total of 377 km (234 mi) of route and 173 stations across 10 lines. They are Line 1, Line 2, Line 3, Line 4, Line 10, Line S1, Line S3, Line S7, Line S8 and Line S9. The city is planning to complete a 17-line Metro and light-rail system by 2030. The expansion of the Metro network will greatly facilitate intracity transport and reduce the currently heavy traffic congestion.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nNanjing's airport, Lukou International Airport, serves both national and international flights. In 2013, Nanjing airport handled 15,011,792 passengers and 255,788.6 tonnes of freight. The airport currently has 85 routes to national and international destinations, which include Japan, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, United States and Germany. The airport is connected by a 29-kilometer (18 mi) highway directly to the city center, and is also linked to various intercity highways, making it accessible to the passengers from the surrounding cities. A railway Ninggao Intercity Line has been built to link the airport with Nanjing South Railway Station. Lukou Airport was opened on 28 June 1997, replacing Nanjing Dajiaochang Airport as the main airport serving Nanjing. Dajiaochang Airport is still used as a military air base. Nanjing has another airport \u2013 Nanjing Ma'an International Airport which temporarily serves as a dual-use military and civil airport.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nThe Port of Nanjing is the largest inland port in China, with annual cargo tonnage reached 191,970,000 t in 2012. The port area is 98 km (61 mi) in length and has 64 berths including 16 berths for ships with a tonnage of more than 10,000. Nanjing is also the biggest container port along the Yangtze River; in March 2004, the one million container-capacity base, Longtan Containers Port Area opened, further consolidating Nanjing as the leading port in the region. As of 2010, it operated six public ports and three industrial ports. The Yangtze River's 12.5-meter-deep waterway enables 50,000-ton-class ocean ships directly arrive at the Nanjing Port, and the ocean ships with the capacities of 100,000 tons or above can also reach the port after load reduction in the Yangtze River's high-tide period. CSC Jinling has a large shipyard.\n\n\n=== Yangtze River crossings ===\n\nIn the 1960s, the first Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was completed, and served as the only bridge crossing over the Lower Yangtze in eastern China at that time. The bridge was a source of pride and an important symbol of modern China, having been built and designed by the Chinese themselves following failed surveys by other nations and the reliance on and then rejection of Soviet expertise. Begun in 1960 and opened to traffic in 1968, the bridge is a two-tiered road and rail design spanning 4,600 meters on the upper deck, with approximately 1,580 meters spanning the river itself.  Since then four more bridges and two tunnels have been built.  Going in the downstream direction, the Yangtze crossings in Nanjing are: Dashengguan Bridge, Line 10 Metro Tunnel, Third Bridge, Nanjing Yangtze River Tunnel (\u5357\u4eac\u957f\u6c5f\u96a7\u9053), First Bridge, Second Bridge and Fourth Bridge,Nanjing Yangtze Tunnel (\u5357\u4eac\u626c\u5b50\u6c5f\u96a7\u9053). In the near future, Such Yangtze Crossings will be added as follow :Jianning West Rd. Tunnel, Xianxin Rd. Tunnel, Heyan Rd. Tunnel, Fifth Nanjing Yangtze Bridge.\n\n\n== Culture and art ==\n\nBeing one of the four ancient capitals of China, Nanjing has always been a cultural center attracting intellectuals from all over the country. In the Tang and Song dynasties, Nanjing was a place where poets gathered and composed poems reminiscent of its luxurious past; during the Ming and Qing dynasties, the city was the official imperial examination center (Jiangnan Examination Hall) for the Jiangnan region, again acting as a hub where different thoughts and opinions converged and thrived.\nToday, with a long cultural tradition and strong support from local educational institutions, Nanjing is commonly viewed as a \"city of culture\" and one of the more pleasant cities to live in China.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nSome of the leading art groups of China are based in Nanjing; they include the Qianxian Dance Company, Nanjing Dance Company, Jiangsu Peking Opera Institute and Nanjing Xiaohonghua Art Company among others.\nJiangsu Province Kun Opera is one of the best theaters for Kunqu, China's oldest stage art.\nIt is considered a conservative and traditional troupe. Nanjing also has professional opera troupes for the Yang, Yue (shaoxing), Xi and Jing (Chinese opera varieties) as well as Suzhou pingtan, spoken theater and puppet theater.\nJiangsu Art Gallery is the largest gallery in Jiangsu Province, presenting some of the best traditional and contemporary art pieces of China like the historical Master Ho-Kan; many other smaller-scale galleries, such as Red Chamber Art Garden and Jinling Stone Gallery, also have their own special exhibitions.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nMany traditional festivals and customs were observed in the old times, which included climbing the City Wall on January 16, bathing in Qing Xi on March 3, hill hiking on September 9 and others (the dates are in Chinese lunar calendar). Almost none of them, however, are still celebrated by modern Nanjingese.\nInstead, Nanjing, as a tourist destination, hosts a series of government-organized events throughout the year. The annual International Plum Blossom Festival held in Plum Blossom Hill, the largest plum collection in China, attracts thousands of tourists both domestically and internationally. Other events include Nanjing Baima Peach Blossom and Kite Festival, Jiangxin Zhou Fruit Festival and Linggu Temple Sweet Osmanthus Festival.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\nNanjing Library, founded in 1907, houses more than 10 million volumes of printed materials and is the third largest library in China, after the National Library in Beijing and Shanghai Library. Other libraries, such as city-owned Jinling Library and various district libraries, also provide considerable amount of information to citizens. Nanjing University Library is the second largest university libraries in China after Peking University Library, and the fifth largest nationwide, especially in the number of precious collections.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nNanjing has some of the oldest and finest museums in China. Nanjing Museum, formerly known as National Central Museum during ROC period, is the first modern museum and remains as one of the leading museums in China having 400,000 items in its permanent collection. The museum is notable for enormous collections of Ming and Qing imperial porcelain, which is among the largest in the world.\nOther museums include the City Museum of Nanjing in the Chaotian Palace, the Oriental Metropolitan Museum, the China Modern History Museum in the Presidential Palace, the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall, the Taiping Kingdom History Museum, Jiangning Imperial Silk Manufacturing Museum, Nanjing Yunjin Museum, Nanjing City Wall Cultural Museum, Nanjing Customs Museum in Ganxi House, Nanjing Astronomical History Museum, Nanjing Paleontological Museum, Nanjing Geological Museum, Nanjing Riverstones Museum, and other museums and memorials such Zheng He Memorial Jinling Four Modern Calligraphers Memorial.\n\n\n=== Theater ===\nMost of Nanjing's major theaters are multi-purpose, used as convention halls, cinemas, musical halls and theaters on different occasions. The major theaters include the People's Convention Hall and the Nanjing Arts and Culture Center. The Capital Theater well known in the past is now a museum in theater/film.\n\n\n=== Night life ===\n\nTraditionally Nanjing's nightlife was mostly centered around Nanjing Fuzimiao (Confucius Temple) area along the Qinhuai River, where night markets, restaurants and pubs thrived. Boating at night in the river was a main attraction of the city. Thus, one can see the statues of the famous teachers and educators of the past not too far from those of the courtesans who educated the young men in the other arts.\nIn the past 20 years, several commercial streets have been developed, hence the nightlife has become more diverse: there are shopping malls opening late in the Xinjiekou CBD, as well as in and around major residential areas throughout the city. The well-established \"Nanjing 1912\" district hosts a wide variety of recreational facilities ranging from traditional restaurants and western pubs to dance clubs, in both its downtown location and beside Baijia Lake in Jiangning District. In recent years, many night-life options have opened up in Catherine Park as well as in shopping malls such as IST in Xinjiekou and Kingmo near Baijai Lake metro station. Other, more student-oriented places are to be found near to Nanjing University and Nanjing Normal University.\n\n\n=== Food and symbolism ===\nThe local cuisine in Nanjing is called Jinling cuisine (\u91d1\u9675\u83dc) or Jingsu cuisine (\u4eac\u82cf\u83dc); it is part of Jiangsu province's cuisine.  Jinling cuisine is famous for its meticulous process, emphasizing no added preservatives and its seasonality. Its duck and goose dishes are well known among Chinese for centuries.  It also employs many different style of cooking methods, such as slow cooking, Chinese oven cooking, etc. Its dishes tend to be light and fresh, suitable for all. The restaurant specializing in Jinling cuisine is Ma Xiang Xing (\u9a6c\u7965\u5174\u83dc\u9986).\nMany of the city's local favorite dishes are based on ducks, including Nanjing salted duck, duck blood and vermicelli soup, and duck oil pancake.The radish is also a typical food representing people of Nanjing, which has been spread through word of mouth as an interesting fact for many years in China. According to Nanjing.GOV.cn, \"There is a long history of growing radish in Nanjing especially the southern suburb. In the spring, the radish tastes very juicy and sweet. It is well-known that people in Nanjing like eating radish. And the people are even addressed as 'Nanjing big radish', which means they are unsophisticated, passionate and conservative. From health perspective, eating radish can help to offset the stodgy food that people take during the Spring Festival\".\n\n\n== Sports and stadiums ==\n\nNanjing's planned 20,000 seat Youth Olympic Sports Park Gymnasium will be one of the venues for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\n\nAs a major Chinese city, Nanjing is home to many professional sports teams. Jiangsu Suning FC, the football club currently staying in Chinese Super League, is a long-term tenant of Nanjing Olympic Sports Center. Jiangsu Nangang Basketball Club is a competitive team which has long been one of the major clubs fighting for the title in China top level league, CBA. Jiangsu Volleyball men and women teams are also traditionally considered as at top level in China volleyball league.\nThere are two major sports centers in Nanjing, Wutaishan Sports Center and Nanjing Olympic Sports Center. Both of these two are comprehensive sports centers, including stadium, gymnasium, natatorium, tennis court, etc. Wutaishan Sports Center was established in 1952 and it was one of the oldest and most advanced stadiums in early time of People's Republic of China.\nNanjing hosted the 10th National Games of PRC in 2005 and hosted the 2nd summer Youth Olympic Games in 2014.\n\nIn 2005, to host The 10th National Game of People's Republic of China, there was a new stadium, Nanjing Olympic Sports Center, constructed in Nanjing. Compared to Wutaishan Sports Center, which the major stadium's capacity is 18,500, Nanjing Olympic Sports Center has a more advanced stadium which is big enough to seat 60,000 spectators. Its gymnasium has capacity of 13,000, and natatorium of capacity 3,000.\nOn 10 February 2010, the 122nd IOC session at Vancouver announced Nanjing as the host city for the 2nd Summer Youth Olympic Games. The slogan of the 2014 Youth Olympic Games was \"Share the Games, Share our Dreams\". The Nanjing 2014 Youth Olympic Games featured all 28 sports on the Olympic program and were held from 16 to 28 August. The Nanjing Youth Olympic Games Organizing Committee (NYOGOC) worked together with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to attract the best young athletes from around the world to compete at the highest level. Off the competition fields, an integrated culture and education program focused on discussions about education, Olympic values, social challenges, and cultural diversity. The YOG aims to spread the Olympic spirit and encourage sports participation.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe city is renowned for its wide variety of architectures which mainly contain buildings from multiple dynasties, the Republic of China, and the present.\n\n\n=== Imperial period ===\n\n\n==== Inside the walled city ====\nCity Wall of Nanjing (\u5357\u4eac\u57ce\u5899)\nGate of China (Zhonghuamen; \u4e2d\u534e\u95e8)\nFuzimiao (Confucius Temple) and Qinhuai River (\u5357\u4eac\u592b\u5b50\u5e99 \u79e6\u6dee\u6cb3)\nJiangnan Examination Hall (\u6c5f\u5357\u8d21\u9662)\nZhanyuan Garden (\u77bb\u56ed)\nOld Gate East (Laomendong) (\u8001\u95e8\u4e1c)\nTaoye Ferry (\u6843\u53f6\u6e21)\nMing Palace Site (\u660e\u6545\u5bab)\nXu Garden (\u7166\u56ed)\nJiming Temple (\u9e21\u9e23\u5bfa)\nBeiji Ge (\u5317\u6781\u9601)\nDrum Tower of Nanjing (\u5357\u4eac\u9f13\u697c)\nChaotian Palace (\u671d\u5929\u5bab)\nStone City (\u77f3\u5934\u57ce)\nYuejiang Tower (\u9605\u6c5f\u697c)\nJinghai Temple (\u9759\u6d77\u5bfa)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Outside the walled city ====\nPurple Mountain Scenic Area (\u7d2b\u91d1\u5c71)\nMing Xiaoling Mausoleum and its surrounding complex (\u660e\u5b5d\u9675)\nLinggu Temple (\u7075\u8c37\u5bfa)\nXuanwu Lake (\u7384\u6b66\u6e56)\nQixia Temple (\u6816\u971e\u5bfa)\nThe Porcelain Pagoda of Nanjing (restored) (\u5927\u62a5\u6069\u5bfa\u7409\u7483\u5854)\nMochou Lake and Park (\u83ab\u6101\u6e56)\nYangshan Quarry (\u9633\u5c71\u7891\u6750)\nSouthern Tang Mausoleums (\u5357\u5510\u4e8c\u9675)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Republic of China period ===\nBecause it was designated as the national capital, many structures were built around that time.

It is one of the \"Four Buddhist Temples\" in Wuhan.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Northern and Southern dynasties ===\nThe temple was first built in the Liu Song dynasty (420\u2013479) with the name of \"Dongshan Temple\" (\u4e1c\u5c71\u5bfa; 'Eastern Mountain Temple') and was renamed \"Mituo Temple\" (\u5f25\u9640\u5bfa; 'Maitreya Temple') in the reign of Emperor Taizong of the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907).\n\n\n=== Song dynasty ===\nIn the Duanping period (1234\u20131236) of the Song dynasty (960\u20131279), Emperor Lizong honored the name \"Chongning Wanshou Chan Temple\" (\u5d07\u5b81\u4e07\u5bff\u7985\u5bfa)\n\n\n=== Yuan dynasty ===\nIn the Yuan dynasty (1271\u20131368), a seven story Chinese pagoda was built.\n\n\n=== Ming dynasty ===\nIn 1381, in the 14th year of Hongwu period in the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644), Zhu Zhen, a son of Hongwu Emperor, restored the temple on Mount Hong. The Mahavira Hall was added in 1457 by Prince Zhu Jun'e (\u6731\u5747\u8bb9). Baotong Temple was largely extended in 1485 and its name was changed into \"Baotong Chan Temple\" (\u5b9d\u901a\u7985\u5bfa), which is still in use now.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty ===\nBaotong Temple underwent three renovations in the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911), respectively in the ruling of Kangxi Emperor (1676), in the reign of Qianlong Emperor (1792) and in the Tongzhi and Guangxu periods (1865\u20131879). In the heyday of the temple, it had more than 1,500 monks.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\nIn 1911, during the Xinhai Revolution, the revolutionary army were here to garrison. Then Cheng Qian donated property to repair the temple but it was demolished by wars soon.\nIn 1932, abbot Wenxian (\u95ee\u8d24) refurbished and redecorated the temple.\nOn November 24, 1935, the President Li Yuanhong's surpassing ceremony was held in Baotong Temple.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\nAfter the founding of the Communist State in 1952, Wuhan Municipal Government has allocated a large sum of money for constructing the temple.\nBaotong Temple has been inscribed as a National Key Buddhist Temple in Han Chinese Area by the State Council of China in 1983.In 1994, the Wuchang Buddhist College was elected in Baotong Temple.\nThe Mahavira Hall was completed in April 2005.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nNow the existing main buildings include Shanmen, Heavenly Kings Hall, Mahavira Hall, Hall of Guru, Free Life Pond, Jade Buddha Hall, Meditation Hall, Dharma Hall, Hall of Maitreya, Reception Hall, etc.\n\n\n=== Hongshan Pagoda ===\nConstruction to the Hongshan Pagoda began in 1280 and were completed in 1291 during the Yuan dynasty (1271\u20131368), in memory of the prominent monk Lingji Ciren (\u7075\u6d4e\u6148\u5fcd). It initially called \"Lingji Pagoda\" (\u7075\u6d4e\u5854) and renamed \"Baotong Pagoda\" (\u5b9d\u901a\u5854) in 1485 during the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644). Because it located on Mount Hong, the pagoda is also known as the \"Hongshan Pagoda\" (\u6d2a\u5c71\u5854; 'Pagoda of Mount Hong'). The seven story, 44.1-metre (145 ft) tall, octagonal-based pagoda is made of brick and stone. Its pedestal is 37.3-metre (122 ft) wide. The pagoda features a facade of doors and windows, as well as columns, rafters, and brackets.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nZhang Yuhuan (2012). \"The Royal Temple in Wuchang District: Baotong Chan Temple\" \u300a\u5386\u4ee3\u7684\u7687\u5bb6\u5bfa\u9662\uff1a\u6b66\u660c\u533a\u5b9d\u901a\u7985\u5bfa\u300b.  \u300a\u56fe\u89e3\u4e2d\u56fd\u8457\u540d\u4f5b\u6559\u5bfa\u9662\u300b [Illustration of Famous Buddhist Temples in China] (in Chinese).

        "wiki": "Wuhan (simplified Chinese: \u6b66\u6c49; traditional Chinese: \u6b66\u6f22, [\u00f9.x\u00e2n] (listen)) is the capital city of Hubei Province in the People's Republic of China. It is the largest city in Hubei and the most populous city in Central China, with a population of over 11 million, the ninth most populous Chinese city and one of the nine National Central Cities of China.The name \"Wuhan\" came from the city's historical origin from the conglomeration of Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang, which are collectively known as the \"Three Towns of Wuhan\" (\u6b66\u6c49\u4e09\u9547).  It lies in the eastern Jianghan Plain, at the confluence of the Yangtze river and its largest tributary, the Han River and is known as \"Nine Provinces' Thoroughfare\" (\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862).Wuhan is considered by some to be one of the potential sites of the pivotal Battle of the Red Cliffs, which stopped warlord Cao Cao's incursion into southern China at the end of the Eastern Han dynasty. Other historical events taking place in Wuhan include the Wuchang Uprising of 1911, which led to the downfall of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China. Wuhan was briefly the capital of China in 1927 under the left wing of the Kuomintang (KMT) government led by Wang Jingwei. The city later served as the wartime capital of China for ten months in 1937 during the Second Sino-Japanese War. A novel coronavirus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic was first identified in Wuhan in December 2019.Wuhan is considered the political, economic, financial, commercial, cultural and educational center of Central China. It is a major transportation hub, with dozens of railways, roads and expressways passing through the city and connecting to other major cities. Because of its key role in domestic transportation, Wuhan is sometimes referred to as \"the Chicago of China\" by foreign sources. The \"Golden Waterway\" of the Yangtze River and the Han River traverse the urban area and divide Wuhan into the three districts of Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge crosses the Yangtze in the city. The Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest power station in terms of installed capacity, is located nearby. Historically, Wuhan has suffered risks of flooding, prompting the government to alleviate the situation by introducing ecologically friendly absorption mechanisms.While Wuhan has been a traditional manufacturing hub for decades, it is also one of the areas promoting modern industrial changes in China. Wuhan consists of three national development zones, four scientific and technological development parks, over 350 research institutes, 1,656 high tech enterprises, numerous enterprise incubators and investments from 230 Fortune Global 500 firms. It produced GDP of US$22.4 billion in 2018. The Dongfeng Motor Corporation, an automobile manufacturer, is headquartered in Wuhan. The city is home to multiple notable institutes of higher education, including Wuhan University and the Huazhong University of Science and Technology. In 2017, Wuhan was designated as a Creative City by UNESCO, in the field of design. Wuhan is classified as a Beta world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Wuhan\" is a portmanteau of the two major cities on the northern and southern banks of the Yangtze River that make up the Wuhan metropolis: \"Wu\" refers to the city of Wuchang (Chinese: \u6b66\u660c), which lies on the southern bank of the Yangtze, while \"Han\" refers to the city of Hankou (Chinese: \u6c49\u53e3), which lies on the northern bank of the Yangtze.\nIn 1926, the Northern Expedition reached the Wuhan area and it was decided to merge Hankou, Wuchang and Hanyang into one city in order to make a new capital for Nationalist China. On January 1, 1927, the resulting city was proclaimed as '\u6b66\u6f22' (the traditional Chinese characters for 'Wuhan'), which was later simplified as '\u6b66\u6c49' (also 'Wuhan').\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nThe Wuhan area has been settled for 3,500 years. Panlongcheng, an archaeological site primarily associated with the Erligang culture (c. 1510 \u2013 c. 1460 BC) (being sparsely populated during the earlier Erlitou period), is located in modern-day Huangpi District.\nDuring the Western Zhou the State of E, which gives its name to the single character abbreviation for Hubei province, controlled the present-day Wuchang area south of the Yangtze River. After the conquest of the E state in 863 BC, the present-day Wuhan area was controlled by the State of Chu for the rest of the Western Zhou and Eastern Zhou periods.  Chu was in turn conquered by Qin in 223 BCE.\n\n\n=== Imperial China ===\n\nDuring the Han dynasty, Hanyang became a fairly busy port. The Battle of Xiakou in AD 203 and Battle of Jiangxia five years later were fought over control of Jiangxia Commandery (present-day Xinzhou District in northeast Wuhan). In the winter of 208/9, one of the most famous battles in Chinese history and a central event in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms\u2014the Battle of Red Cliffs\u2014took place near the Yangtze River, with the cliffs near Wuhan identified as one of the potential locations. Around that time, walls were built to protect Hanyang (AD 206) and Wuchang (AD 223). The latter event marks the foundation of Wuhan. In AD 223, the Yellow Crane Tower, one of the Four Great Towers of China, was constructed on the Wuchang side of the Yangtze River by order of Sun Quan, leader of the Eastern Wu. The tower become a sacred site of Taoism.Due to tensions between the Eastern Wu and Cao Wei kingdoms, in the autumn of 228, Cao Rui, grandson of Cao Cao and the second emperor of the state of Cao Wei, ordered the general Man Chong to lead troops to Xiakou (\u590f\u53e3; in present-day Wuhan). In 279, Wang Jun and his army conquered strategic locations in Wu territory such as Xiling (in present-day Yichang, Hubei), Xiakou (\u590f\u53e3; present-day Hankou) and Wuchang (\u6b66\u660c; present-day Ezhou, Hubei).\nDuring the Northern and Southern dynasties period, the Wuhan area was part of the successive Southern dynasty states Liu Song (420\u2013479), Southern Qi (479\u2013502), Liang, and Western Liang.\nIn fall 550, Hou Jing sent Ren Yue to attack both Xiao Daxin and Xiao Fan's son Xiao Si (\u856d\u55e3).  Ren killed Xiao Si in battle, and Xiao Daxin, unable to resist, surrendered, allowing Hou to take his domain under control.  Meanwhile, Xiao Guan, who had by now settled at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan), was planning to attack Hou, but this drew Xiao Yi's ire\u2014believing that Xiao Guan was intending to contend for the throne\u2014and he sent Wang to attack Xiao Guan. In summer 567, Chen Xu commissioned Wu Mingche as the governor of Xiang Province and had him command a major part of the troops against Hua, along with Chunyu Liang (\u6df3\u4e8e\u91cf). The opposing sides met at Zhuankou (\u6c8c\u53e3, in modern Wuhan).\nThe city has long been renowned as a center for the arts (especially poetry) and for intellectual studies. Cui Hao, a celebrated poet of the Tang dynasty, visited the Yellow Crane Tower in the early 8th century; his poem made it the most celebrated building in southern China.In spring 877, Wang Xianzhi captured E Prefecture (\u9102\u5dde, in modern Wuhan).  He then returned north, joining forces with Huang again, and they surrounded Song Wei at Song Prefecture (\u5b8b\u5dde, in modern Shangqiu, Henan).  In winter 877, Huang Chao pillaged Qi and Huang (\u9ec3\u5dde, in modern Wuhan) Prefectures.\nBefore Kublai Khan arrived in 1259, word reached him that M\u00f6ngke had died. Kublai decided to keep the death of his brother secret and continued the attack on the Wuhan area, near the Yangtze. The present-day Wuying Pagoda was constructed at the end of the Song Dynasty between attacks by the Mongolian forces.  Under the Mongol rulers (Yuan dynasty) (after 1301), the Wuchang prefecture, headquartered in the town, became the capital of Hubei province. Hankou, from the Ming to late Qing, was under the administration of the local government in Hanyang, although it was already one of the four major national markets (zh:\u56db\u5927\u540d\u9547) of the Ming dynasty.\nHanyang's Guiyuan Temple was completed in the 15th year of Shunzhi (1658).By the dawn of the 18th century, Hankou had become one of China's top four most important towns of trade. In the late 19th century, railroads were extended on a north\u2013south axis through the city, making Wuhan an important transshipment point between rail and river traffic. Also during this period foreign powers extracted mercantile concessions, with the riverfront of Hankou being divided up into foreign-controlled merchant districts. These districts contained trading firm offices, warehouses, and docking facilities. The French had a concession in Hankou. During the Taiping Rebellion, the Wuhan area was controlled for many years by rebel forces and the Yellow Crane Tower, Xingfu Temple, Zhuodaoquan Temple and other buildings were repurposed or damaged. During the Second Opium War (known in the West as the Arrow War, 1856\u20131860), the government of the Qing dynasty was defeated by the western powers and signed the Treaties of Tianjin and the Convention of Peking, which stipulated eleven cities or regions (including Hankou) as trading ports. In December 1858, James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, High Commissioner to China, led four warships up the Yangtze River in Wuhan to collect the information needed for opening the trading port in Wuhan.\nIn the spring of 1861, Counselor Harry Parkes and Admiral Herbert were sent to Wuhan to open a trading port. On the basis of the Convention of Peking, Harry Parkes concluded the Hankou Lend-Lease Treaty with Guan Wen, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei. It brought an area of 30.53 square kilometers (11.79 sq mi) along the Yangtze River (from latter-day Jianghan Road to Hezuo Road) to become a British Concession and permitted Britain to set up its consulate in the concession.\n\nIn 1889, Zhang Zhidong was transferred from Viceroy of Liangguang (Guangdong and Guangxi provinces) to Viceroy of Huguang (Hunan and Hubei provinces). He governed the province for 18 years, until 1907. During this period, he elucidated the theory of \"Chinese learning as the basis, Western learning for application,\" known as the ti-yong ideal. He set up many heavy industries, founded Hanyang Steel Plant, Daye Iron Mine, Pingxiang Coal Mine and Hubei Arsenal and set up local textile industries, boosting the flourishing modern industry in Wuhan. Meanwhile, he initiated education reform, opened dozens of modern educational organizations successively, such as Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) Academy of Classical Learning, Civil General Institute, Military General Institute, Foreign Languages Institute and Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) General Normal School, and selected a great many students for study overseas, which well promoted the development of China's modern education. Furthermore, he trained a modern military and organized a modern army including a zhen and a xie (both zhen and xie are military units in the Qing dynasty) in Hubei.\nOriginally known as the Hubei Arsenal, the Hanyang Arsenal was founded in 1891 by Qing official Zhang Zhidong, who diverted funds from the Nanyang Fleet in Guangdong to build the arsenal. It cost about 250,000 pounds sterling and was built in 4 years. On 23 April 1894, construction was completed and the arsenal, occupying some 40 acres (160,000 m2), could start production of small-caliber cannons. It built magazine-fed rifles, Gruson quick fire guns, and cartridges.\n\n\n==== Wuchang Uprising ====\n\nBy 1900, according to Collier's magazine, Hankau, the Yangtze River boom town, was \"the St. Louis and Chicago of China.\" On October 10, 1911, Sun Yat-sen's followers launched the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the collapse of the Qing dynasty, as well as the establishment of the Chinese Republic.The Wuchang Uprising of October 1911, which overthrew the Qing dynasty, originated in Wuhan. Before the uprising, anti-Qing secret societies were active in Wuhan. In September 1911, the outbreak of the protests in Sichuan forced the Qing authorities to send part of the New Army garrisoned in Wuhan to suppress the rebellion. On September 14 the Literary Society (\u6587\u5b78\u793e) and the Progressive Association (\u5171\u9032\u6703), two local revolutionary organizations in Hubei, set up joint headquarters in Wuchang and planned for an uprising. On the morning of October 9, a bomb at the office of the political arrangement exploded prematurely and alerted local authorities. The proclamation for the uprising, beadroll and the revolutionaries\u2019 official seal fell into the hands of Rui Cheng, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei, who demolished the uprising headquarters the same day and set out to arrest the revolutionaries listed in the beadroll. This forced the revolutionaries to launch the uprising earlier than planned.On the night of October 10, the revolutionaries fired shots to signal the uprising at the engineering barracks of Hubei New Army. They then led the New Army of all barracks to join the revolution. Under the guidance of Wu Zhaolin, Cai Jimin and others, this revolutionary army seized the official residence of the governor and government offices. Rui Cheng fled in panic into the Chuyu ship. Zhang Biao, the commander of the Qing army, also fled the city. On the morning of the 11th, the revolutionary army took the whole city of Wuchang, but leaders such as Jiang Yiwu and Sun Wu disappeared. Thus the leaderless revolutionary army recommended Li Yuanhong, the assistant governor of the Qing army, as the commander-in-chief. Li founded the Hubei Military Government, proclaimed the abolition of the Qing rule in Hubei, the founding of the Republic of China and published an open telegram calling for other provinces to join the revolution.As the revolution spread to other parts of the country, the Qing government concentrated loyalist military forces to suppress the uprising in Wuhan. From October 17 to December 1, the revolutionary army and local volunteers defended the city in the Battle of Yangxia against better armed and more numerous Qing forces commanded by Yuan Shikai. Huang Xing would arrive in Wuhan in early November to take command of the revolutionary army. After fierce fighting and heavy casualties, Qing forces seized Hankou and Hanyang. But Yuan agreed to halt the advance on Wuchang and participated in peace talks, which would eventually lead to the return of Sun Yat-sen from exile, founding of the Republic of China on January 1, 1912. Through the Wuchang Uprising, Wuhan is known as the birthplace of the Xinhai Revolution, named after the Xinhai year on the Chinese calendar. The city has several museums and memorials to the revolution and the thousands of martyrs who died defending the revolution.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\n\nWith the northern extension of the Northern Expedition, the center of the Great Revolution shifted from the Pearl River basin to the Yangtze River basin. On November 26, the Kuomintang Central Political Committee decided to move the capital from Guangzhou to Wuhan. In mid-December, most of the KMT central executive commissioners and national government commissioners arrived in Wuhan, set up the temporary joint conference of central executive commissioners and National Government commissioners, performed the top functions of central party headquarters and National Government, declared they would work in Wuhan on January 1, 1927, and decided to combine the towns of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang into Wuhan City, called \"Capital District\". The new national government, later known as \"Wuhan nationalist government\", was based in the Nanyang Building in Hankou, while the central party headquarters and other organizations chose their locations in Hankou or Wuchang.In March 1927, Mao Zedong appeared at the Third Plenum of the KMT Central Executive Committee in Wuhan, which sought to strip General Chiang of his power by appointing Wang Jingwei leader. The first phase of the Northern Expedition was interrupted by the political split in the Kuomintang following the formation of the Nanjing faction in April 1927 against the existing faction in Wuhan. Members of the Chinese Communist Party, who had survived the April 12 massacre, met at Wuhan and reelected Chen Duxiu (Ch'en Tu-hsiu) as the Party's Secretary General. The split was partially motivated by the purge of the Communists within the party, which marked the end of the First United Front, and Chiang Kai-shek briefly stepped down as the commander of the National Revolutionary Army.In June 1927, Stalin sent a telegram to the Communists in Wuhan, calling for the mobilization of an army of workers and peasants. This alarmed Wang Jingwei, who decided to break with the Communists and come to terms with Chiang Kai-shek. The Wuhan coup was a political shift made on July 15, 1927, by Wang Jingwei towards Chiang Kai-shek, and his Shanghai-based rival in the Kuomintang. The Wuhan Nationalist Government was established in Wuhan on February 21, 1927, and ended by August 19, 1927. After the end of the Northern Expedition, Hankou was elevated to a centrally-controlled municipality.\n\nIn the 1931 China floods, one of the deadliest flood disasters in world history, Wuhan was a refuge for flood victims from outlying areas, who had been arriving since the late spring. But when the city itself was inundated in the early summer, and after a catastrophic dike failure just before 6:00 AM on July 27, an estimated 782,189 urban citizens and rural refugees were left homeless. The flood covered an area of 32 square miles and the city was flooded under many feet of water for close to three months. Large numbers gathered on flood islands throughout the city, with 30,000 sheltering on a railway embankment in central Hankou. With little food and a complete breakdown in sanitation, thousands soon began to succumb to diseases. Jin Shilong, Senior Engineer at the Hubei Flood Prevention Agency, described the flooding:There was no warning, only a sudden great wall of water. Most of Wuhan's buildings in those days were only one story high, and for many people there was no escape- they died by the tens of thousands. ... I was just coming off duty at the company's main office, a fairly new three-story building near the center of town ... When I heard the terrible noise and saw the wall of water coming, I raced to the top story of the building. ... I was in one of the tallest and strongest buildings left standing. At that time no one knew whether the water would subside or rise even higher.The high-water mark was reached on 19 August at Hankou, with the water level exceeding 16 m (53 ft) above normal. In 1936, when natural disaster struck Central China with widespread flooding affecting Hebei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Wuhan and Chongqing caused by the Yangtze and Huai Rivers bursting their banks, Ong Seok Kim, as Chairman of the Sitiawan Fundraising and Disaster Relief Committee, raised money and materials in support of the victims.\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War and following the fall of Nanking in December 1937, Wuhan had become the provisional capital of China's Kuomintang government, and became another focal point of pitched air battles beginning in early 1938 between modern monoplane bomber and fighter aircraft of the Imperial Japanese forces and the Chinese Air Force, which included support from the Soviet Volunteer Group in both planes and personnel, as U.S. support in war materials waned. As the battle raged on through 1938, Wuhan and the surrounding region had become the site of the Battle of Wuhan. After being taken by the Japanese in late 1938, Wuhan became a major Japanese logistics center for operations in southern China.\n\nIn early October 1938, Japanese troops moved east and north in the outskirts of Wuhan. As a result, numerous companies and enterprises and large numbers of people had to withdraw from Wuhan to the west of Hubei and Sichuan. The KMT navy undertook the responsibility of defending the Yangtze River on patrol and covering the withdrawal. On October 24, while overseeing the waters of the Yangtze River near the town of Jinkou (Jiangxia District in Wuhan) in Wuchang, the KMT gunboat Zhongshan came up against six Japanese aircraft. Though two were eventually shot down, the Zhongshan sank with 25 casualties. Raised from the bottom of the Yangtze River in 1997, and restored at a local shipyard, the Zhongshan has been moved to a purpose-built museum in Wuhan's suburban Jiangxia District, which opened on September 26, 2011.As a key center on the Yangtze, Wuhan was an important base for Japanese operations in China. On 18 December 1944, Wuhan was bombed by 77 American bombers that set off a firestorm that destroyed much of the city. For the next three days, Wuhan was bombed by the Americans, destroying all of the docks and warehouses of Wuhan, as well as the Japanese air bases in the city. The air raids killed thousands of Chinese civilians which American bombers did not know. \"According to casualty statistics compiled by Hankou city in 1946, more than 20,000 were killed or injured in the December bombings of 1944.\"Wuhan returned to Chinese control in September 1945. Administratively, Wuchang and Hanyang were initially combined into a new City of Wuchang, but in October 1946 were separated into the City of Wuchang (including Wuchang only) and the County of Hanyang. Hankou became a centrally controlled municipality in August 1947. Militarily, the Wuhan Forward Headquarters was established in Wuhan, headed by Bai Chongxi.\n\nDuring the later stages of the Chinese Civil War, Bai sought to broker peace, proposing that the Communist Party could rule northern China while the Nationalist government retained southern China. This was rejected, and on 15 May 1949 Bai and the Wuhan garrison retreated from the city. People's Liberation Army troops entered Wuhan on the afternoon of Monday, May 16, 1949.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n\nThe Changjiang Water Resources Commission was reestablished in February 1950 with its headquarters in Wuhan. From June to September 1954, the Yangtze River Floods were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to an unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. In 1969, a large stone monument was erected in the riverside park in Hankou honoring the heroic deeds in fighting the 1954 Yangtze River floods.\nBefore construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, Hunslet Engine Company built two extra heavy 0-8-0 locomotives for loading the train ferries for crossing the Yangtze River in Wuhan.\nThe project of building the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also known as the First Yangtze River Bridge, was regarded as one of the key projects during the first five-year plan. On October 25, 1955, construction began on the bridge proper. The same day in 1957, the whole project was completed and an opening-to-traffic ceremony was held on October 15. The First Yangtze River Bridge united the Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway with the Guangdong\u2013Hankou Railway into the Beijing\u2013Guangzhou Railway, making Wuhan a 'thoroughfare to nine provinces' (\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862) in name and in fact.\nAfter Chengdu Conference, Mao went to Chongqing and Wuhan in April to inspect the countryside and factories. In Wuhan, he called all the leaders of provinces and municipalities who had not attended Chengdu Conference to report their work. Tian Jiaying, the secretary of Mao, said that Wuhan Conference was a supplement to Chengdu Conference.In July 1967, civil strife struck the city in the Wuhan Incident (\"July 20th Incident\"), an armed conflict between two hostile groups who were fighting for control over the city at the height of the Cultural Revolution.In 1981, the Wuhan City Government commenced reconstruction of the Yellow Crane Tower at a new location, about 1 km (0.62 mi) from the original site, and it was completed in 1985. In 1957, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was built with one trestle of the bridge on the site of the tower, which had been last destroyed in 1884.During the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, students in Wuhan blocked the Yangtze River Railway bridge and another 4,000 gathered at the railway station. About one thousand students staged a railroad 'sit-in'. Rail traffic on the Beijing-Guangzhou and Wuhan-Dalian lines was interrupted. The students also urged employees of major state-owned enterprises to go on strike. The situation was so tense that residents reportedly began a bank run and resorted to panic-buying.\n\nIn the wake of the United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade on May 7, 1999, protests broke out throughout China, including in Wuhan.On June 22, 2000, a Wuhan Airlines flight from Enshi to Wuhan was forced to circle for 30 minutes due to thunderstorms. The aircraft eventually crashed on the banks of Han River in Hanyang District, all on-board perished (there were varying accounts of number of crews and passengers). In addition, the crash also killed 7 people on the ground.Chinese protesters organized boycotts of the French-owned retail chain Carrefour in major Chinese cities including Kunming, Hefei and Wuhan, accusing the French nation of pro-secessionist conspiracy and anti-Chinese racism. The BBC reported that hundreds of people demonstrated in Beijing, Wuhan, Hefei, Kunming and Qingdao. On May 19, 2011, Fang Binxing, the Principal of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (also known as \"Father of China's Great Fire Wall\") was hit on the chest by a shoe thrown at him by a Huazhong University of Science and Technology student who calls herself \"hanjunyi\" (\u5bd2\u541b\u4f9d, or \u5c0f\u6e56\u5317) while Fang was giving a lecture at Wuhan University.The city has been subject to devastating floods, which are now supposed to be controlled by the ambitious Three Gorges Dam, a project which was completed in 2008. The 2008 Chinese winter storms damaged water supply equipment in Wuhan: up to 100,000 people were out of running water when several water pipes burst, cutting the supply to local households. The 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat wave hit Wuhan on July 3.\nIn the 2010 China floods, the Han River at Wuhan experienced its worst flooding in twenty years, as officials continued sandbagging efforts along the Han and Yangtze Rivers in the city and checked reservoirs. In the 2011 China floods, Wuhan was flooded, with parts of the city losing power. In the 2016 China floods, Wuhan saw 570 mm (22 in) of rainfall during the first week of July, surpassing the record that fell on the city in 1991. A red alert for heavy rainfall was issued on 2 July, the same day that eight people died after a 15-meter (49 ft) section of a 2 m (6.6 ft) tall wall collapsed on top of them. The city's subway system, the Wuhan Metro was partially submerged as was the main railway station. At least 14 city residents were killed, one was missing, and more than 80,000 were relocated.In early July 2019, there were protests against plans for a new incinerator in Xinzhou District.The 2019 Military World Games were hosted in Wuhan in October.\nIn December 2019, an epidemic of a new coronavirus disease began in Wuhan. The disease, which became known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), spread and developed into the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Wuhan and other Hubei cities were placed under lockdown for nearly three months to contain the disease. On April 8, 2020, the Wuhan lockdown officially came to an end after no new domestic cases were reported in Hubei province.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Overview ===\n\nWuhan is in east-central Hubei, at latitude 29\u00b0 58'\u201331\u00b0 22' N and longitude 113\u00b0 41'\u2013115\u00b0 05' E. Wuhan sits at the confluence of the Han River flowing into the Yangtze River at the East of the Jianghan Plain along the Yangtze's middle reaches.\nThe metropolitan area comprises three parts\u2014Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang\u2014commonly called the \"Three Towns of Wuhan\" (hence the name \"Wuhan\", combining \"Wu\" from the first city and \"Han\" from the other two). The consolidation of these cities occurred in 1927 and Wuhan was thereby established. The three former cities face each other across the rivers and are linked by bridges, including one of the first modern bridges in China, known as the \"First Bridge\".\n\nWuchang lies South East of the Yangtze River that separates it from both Hankou and Hanyang.\nHankou sits North of the Yangtze River separating it from Wuchang. Hankou is North of the Han River separating it from Hanyang.\nHanyang lies West of the Yangtze separating it from Wuchang. Hanyang is south of the Han river separating it from Hankou.\nIt is simple in terrain \u2014 low and flat in the middle and hilly in the south, with the Yangtze and Han rivers winding through the city. The She River enters the Yangtze in Huangpi District. Wuhan occupies a land area of 8,494.41 square kilometers (3,279.71 sq mi), most of which is alluvial plain and decorated with hills and a great number of lakes and ponds. Water makes up one quarter of Wuhan's urban territory, which is the highest percentage among  major cities in China. Wuhan has nearly 200 lakes, including the East Lake of 33 km2, and Tangxun Lake, which are the largest lakes entirely within a city in China.Other well-known lakes include South Lake and Sand Lake. Liangzi Lake, the largest lake by surface area in Hubei province, is located in the southeast of Jiangxia District. At 709 m (2,326 ft) above sea level, the highest point in Wuhan is the main peak of Yunwu Mountain (\u4e91\u96fe\u5c71) in northwestern Huangpi District. There are also several mountains within the city limits of Wuhan including Mount Luojia (\u73de\u73c8\u5c71) in Wuchang District as well as Mount Hong (\u6d2a\u5c71) and Mount Yujia (\u55bb\u5bb6\u5c71/\u745c\u73c8\u5c71) in Hongshan District.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nWuhan's climate is humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) with abundant rainfall in summer and four distinctive seasons. Wuhan is known for its humid summers, when dewpoints can often reach 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) or more. Historically, along with Chongqing and Nanjing, Wuhan is referred to as one of the \"Three Furnacelike Cities\" along the Yangtze River for their hot summers. However, the climate data of recent years suggests that Wuhan is no longer among the top tier of \"The hottest cities in summer\" list, the New Four Furnacelike Cities are Chongqing, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, and Nanchang. Spring and autumn are generally mild, while winter is cool with quite low rainfall and occasional snow. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from 4.0 \u00b0C (39.2 \u00b0F) in January to 29.1 \u00b0C (84.4 \u00b0F) in July. Annual precipitation totals just under 1,320 mm (52 in), the majority of which falls from April to July; the annual mean temperature is 17.13 \u00b0C (62.8 \u00b0F), the frost-free period lasts 211 to 272 days. With monthly possible sunshine percentage ranging from 31 percent in March to 59 percent in August, the city proper receives 1,865 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extreme low and high temperatures recorded are \u221218.1 \u00b0C (\u22121 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1977 and 39.7 \u00b0C (103 \u00b0F) on 27 July 2017 (unofficial record of 41.3 \u00b0C (106 \u00b0F) in 1934).\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nWuhan is a sub-provincial city. Municipal government is regulated by the local Communist Party of China (CPC), led by the Wuhan CPC Secretary (Chinese: \u6b66\u6c49\u5e02\u59d4\u4e66\u8bb0), Wang Zhonglin (\u738b\u5fe0\u6797). The local CPC issues administrative orders, collects taxes, manages the economy, and directs a standing committee of the Municipal People's Congress in making policy decisions and overseeing the local government.\nGovernment officials include the mayor (\u5e02\u957f), Zhou Xianwang (\u5468\u5148\u65fa), and vice-mayors.

Since 2004 it has been a focal point of the Rise of Central China Plan, which aims to build less-developed inland economies into hubs of advanced manufacturing.\nSince 1890, the steel industry has been the backbone of Wuhan's industry. In 2010, automobile industry exceeded GDP for Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO) steel for the first time. There are 5 car manufacturers, including Dongfeng Honda, Citroen, Shanghai GM, DFM Passenger Vehicle and Dongfeng Renault. Dongfeng-Citroen Automobile Co., Ltd is headquartered in the city.As of 2016, Wuhan has attracted foreign investment from over 80 countries, with 5,973 foreign-invested enterprises established in the city with a total capital injection of $22.45 billion USD. Among these, about 50 French companies including Renault and PSA Group have operations in the city, representing over one third of French investment in China, and the highest level of French investment in any Chinese city.Wuhan is an important center for economy, trade, finance, transportation, information technology, and education in China. Its major industries include optic-electronic, automobile manufacturing, iron and steel manufacturing, new pharmaceutical sector, biology engineering, new materials industry and environmental protection.  Environmental sustainability is highlighted in Wuhan's list of emerging industries, which include energy efficiency technology and renewable energy.\n\n\n=== Industrial zones ===\nMajor industrial zones in Wuhan include in chronological order:\n\nWuhan Economic and Technological Development ZoneWuhan Economic and Technological Development Zone is a national level industrial zone incorporated in 1993.

It is located in Wuhan Economic and Technology Development Zone, planned to cover 2.7 square kilometers (1.0 square mile) of land. The first 0.7-square-kilometer (0.3-square-mile) area has already been created.\nWuhan Donghu New Technology Development ZoneWuhan Donghu New Technology Development Zone is a national level high-tech development zone. Optical-electronics, telecommunications, and equipment manufacturing are the core industries of Wuhan East Lake High-Tech Development Zone (ELHTZ) while software outsourcing and electronics are also encouraged. ELHTZ is China's largest production center for optoelectronic products with key players like Yangtze Optical Fiber and Cable, (the largest fiber-optical cable maker in China), and Fiberhome Telecommunications. Wuhan Donghu New Technology Development Zone also represents the development center for China's laser industry with key players such as HG Tech and Chutian Laser being based in the zone.\nWuhan Optical Valley (Guanggu) Software ParkWuhan Optical Valley (Guanggu) Software Park is located in Wuhan Donghu New Technology Development Zone. Wuhan Optics Valley Software Park is jointly developed by East Lake High-Tech Development Zone and Dalian Software Park Co., Ltd. The planned area is 0.67 square kilometers (0.26 square miles) with total floor area of 6,000,000 square meters (65,000,000 square feet). The zone is 8.5 km (5.28 mi) away from the 316 National Highway and is 46.7 km (29.02 mi) away from the Wuhan Tianhe Airport.\n\nWuhan BiolakeBiolake is an industrial base established in 2008 in the Optics Valley of China. Located in East Lake New Technology Development Zone of Wuhan, Biolake covers 15 km2 (5.8 sq mi), and has six parks including Bio-innovation Park, Bio-pharma Park, Bio-agriculture Park, Bio-manufacturing Park, Medical Device Park and Medical Health Park, to accommodate both research activities and living.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nWuhan is the most populous city in Central China and among the most populous in China.  In the Sixth Census of China in 2010, Wuhan's built-up area made of 8 out of 10 urban districts (all but Xinzhou and Hannan not yet conurbated) was home to 8,821,658 inhabitants. As of 2015, the city of Wuhan had an estimated population of 10,607,700 people.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 19 million.\nAs of November 2019, urban development status considering both spatial and socioeconomic processes has been examined using Night Time Lighting data and land cover data as proxies; it showed Wuhan's high concentration\nof socioeconomic activities compared to its urban spatial development.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nAccording to a survey published in 2017, 79.2% of the population of Wuhan are either irreligious or practice worship of gods and ancestors; among these 0.9% are Taoists. Among other religious doctrines, 14.7% of the population adheres to Buddhism, 2.9% to Protestantism, 0.3% to Catholicism and 1.6% to Islam, and 1.6% of the population adheres to unspecified other religions.\nReligious sites in Wuhan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nChina Railway Wuhan Group manages the Wuhan Railway Hub. Wuhan Railway Hub is considered one of the four key railway hubs of China. The city of Wuhan is served by three major railway stations: the Hankou Railway Station in Hankou, the Wuchang Railway Station in Wuchang, and the Wuhan Railway Station, located in a newly developed area east of the East Lake (Hongshan District). As the stations are many miles apart, it is important for passengers to be aware of the particular station(s) used by a particular train.\nThe (original) Hankou Station was the terminus for the Jinghan Railway from Beijing, while the Wuchang Station was the terminus for the Yuehan Railway to Guangzhou. Since the construction of the First Yangtze Bridge and the linking of the two lines into the Jingguang Railway, both Hankou and Wuchang stations have been served by trains going to all directions, which contrasts with the situation in such cities as New York or Moscow, where different stations serve different directions.\nWith the opening of the Hefei-Wuhan high-speed railway on April 1, 2009, Wuhan became served by high-speed trains with Hefei, Nanjing, and Shanghai; several trains a day now connect the city with Shanghai, getting there in under 6 hours. As of early 2010, most of these express trains leave from the Hankou Railway Station.\n\nIn 2006, construction began on the new Wuhan Railway Station with 11 platforms, located on the northeastern outskirts of the city. In December 2009, the station was opened, as China unveiled its second high-speed train with scheduled runs from Guangzhou to Wuhan. Billed as the fastest train in the world, it can reach a speed of 394 km/h (244.82 mph). The travel time between the two cities has been reduced from ten and a half hours to just three. The rail service has been extended north to Beijing.As of 2011, the new Wuhan Railway Station is primarily used by the Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed trains, while most regular trains to other destinations continue to use the Hankou and Wuchang stations.\n\nConstruction work is carried out on several lines of the new Wuhan Metropolitan Area Intercity Railway, which will eventually connect Wuhan's three main rail terminals with several stations throughout the city's outer areas and farther suburbs, as well as with the nearby cities of Xianning, Huangshi, Huanggang, and Xiaogan. The first line of the system, the one to Xianning, opened for passenger operations at the end of 2013. The line to Xiaogen opened on 1 December 2016 and it was extended with the opening of the Wuhan\u2013Shiyan high-speed railway to Shiyan on 29 November 2019.The main freight railway station and classification yard of the Wuhan metropolitan area is the extensive Wuhan North railway station, with 112 tracks and over 650 switches. It is located in Hengdian Subdistrict of Huangpi District, located 20 km (12 mi) north of the Wuhan Station and 23 km (14 mi) from Hankou Station.\n\n\n=== Wuhan Metro ===\n\nWuhan Metro is a rapid transit system serving the city of Wuhan. Owned and operated by Wuhan Metro Group Co., Ltd., the network now includes 9 lines, 228 stations, and 339 km (211 mi) of route length. Line 1, the first line in the system, opened on 28 July 2004, which made Wuhan became the seventh city in mainland China with rapid transit system, after Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Changchun, and Dalian. Line 2 opened on 28 December 2012 and is the first underground metro line crossing the Yangtze River. With 1.22 billion annual passengers in 2019, Wuhan Metro is the sixth-busiest rapid transit system in mainland China. There are a number of lines or sections under construction. The government of Wuhan City promised the citizens that at least two lines or sections open every year. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire network was out of service from 23 January to 27 March 2020.\n\n\n=== Trams ===\n\nTrams were brought to the streets of Wuhan on July 28, 2017 with the first line (Auto-city T1 Line) opened that day. The trams under construction or planning in Wuhan are:\n\nAuto-city trams, with Lines T1, T2, T6, and T8 in the Wuhan Economic Development Area, in the far western reaches on Hanyang. T1 Line is operational as of 2017.\nOptics Valley trams, two lines  (T1 and T2) south and east of Guanggu Circle (Guanggu Guangchang) in southeastern Wuchang. The system opened on January 18, 2018.\nThe Old Hankou Streetcar, a loop line around Hankou city.\n\n\n=== Maritime transport ===\nWuhan is a major hub for maritime transport in central China. The Port of Wuhan provide services for the local population and shipping services.\n\n\n=== Ferry ===\nAs a city located at bank of Yangtze River, Wuhan has long history of ferry services. Modern ferry services were established in 1900 by steam boat. In 1937, a train ferry was established to transport train cars from Hankou to Wuchang. There are numbered stops around Wuhan where people can get on and off the ferry and there is a tourist ferry in the night.\nCurrently, ferry services are provided by the Wuhan Ferry Company. In 2010, the company bought 10 new ships to replace the ones that had been in service for 29 years.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nOpened in April 1995 to substitute for the old Hankou Wangjiadun Airport and Nanhu Airport as the major airport of Wuhan, Wuhan Tianhe International Airport is one of the busiest airports in central China. It is located in Wuhan's suburban Huangpi District 26 kilometers (16 mi) north of Wuhan city proper. The extension of Line 2 of Wuhan Metro to Tianhe Airport opened on 28 December 2016. It has also been selected as China's fourth international hub airport after Beijing Capital International Airport, Shanghai-Pudong and Guangzhou Baiyun. A second terminal was completed in March 2008, having been started in February 2005 with an investment of CNY 3.372 billion. International flights to neighboring Asian countries have also been enhanced, including direct flights to Tokyo and Nagoya, Japan. Terminal 3 has been available for service since early 2017.\nHannan Municipal Airport is an municipal airport that serves Hannan District. It is the biggest airport in China that only handles general aviation, and the biggest municipal airport in Hubei Province. Caidian Municipal Airport is an under-construction airport which will serve Caidian District. The airport began construction on 1 December 2017.\n\n\n=== Highways and expressways ===\nNumerous major highways and expressways pass through Wuhan, including:\n\nChina National Highway 107\nChina National Highway 316\nChina National Highway 318\nG42 Shanghai\u2013Chengdu Expressway\nG0422 Wuhan\u2013Shenzhen Expressway\n\n\n=== Bicycle-sharing system ===\nAs of May 2011, the Wuhan and Hangzhou Public Bicycle bike-share systems in China were the largest in the world, with around 90,000 and 60,000 bicycles respectively. In 2012 the Wuhan and Hangzhou Public Bicycle programs in China are the largest in the world, with around 90,000 and 60,000 bicycles respectively. China has seen a rise in private \"dockless\" bike shares with fleets that dwarf systems in size outside China. Initially, a number of traditional (third generation) docked public bike systems operated by local municipal governments opened across China, with the largest ones being in Wuhan and Hangzhou.  The first was introduced in Beijing in 2007.  However, third generation bike sharing is not considered successful for the majority cities in China.  Bike sharing in Beijing virtually stopped and it also has encountered difficulties in Shanghai and Wuhan.\n\n\n== Destinations ==\n\nThe Yellow Crane Tower (Huanghelou) is presumed to have been first built in approximately 220 AD. The tower has been destroyed and reconstructed numerous times, and was burned last according to some sources in 1884. The tower underwent complete reconstruction in 1981. The reconstruction utilized modern materials and added an elevator while maintaining the traditional design in the tower's outward appearance.\nWuchang has the largest and second largest lakes within a city in China, the East Lake and Tangxun Lake, as well as the South Lake. East Lake in Wuhan is six times the size of the West Lake in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province. The total area is more than 80 km2 (31 sq mi) of which the lake is covering an area of 33 km2 (13 sq mi). In the springtime, the shores of East Lake become a garden of flowers with the Mei blossoms as the king and the Cherry Blossom as the queen among the species at East Lake Cherry Blossom Park. Another famous flower is the lotus. The lake has a long history and especially the Chu Kingdom is well represented around East Lake. Moreover, in the Moshan Botanic Garden there are many types of plum blossoms, as well as lotus flowers.\nThe Hubei Provincial Museum: With over 200,000 valued artifacts, this is one of the leading museums in China.

Wuhan ranks third in China in overall strength of science and technology.As of the end of 2013, in Wuhan there were 1,024 kindergartens with 224,300 children, 590 primary schools with 424,000 students, 369 general high schools with 314,000 students, 105 secondary vocational and technical schools with 98,600 students, and 80 colleges and universities with 966,400 undergraduates and junior college students and 107,400 postgraduate students. There are several international schools in Wuhan.\nHuazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), located in the Optics Valley of China near East Lake, is a Project 985 and Class A Double First Class University. HUST manages Wuhan National Laboratories for Opto-electronics (WNLO), which is one of the five national laboratories in China. HUST is also one of four Chinese universities eligible to run the national laboratory and the national major science and technology infrastructure. Founded in 1953 as Huazhong Institute of Technology, it combined with three other universities (including former Tongji Medical University founded in 1907) in 2000 to form the new HUST, and has 42 schools and departments covering 12 comprehensive disciplines. HUST has 12 Fellows of Chinese Academy of Sciences and 17 Fellows of Chinese Academy of Engineering. U.S. News' 2019 U.S. News & World Report  ranked HUST as 260th in the world, and 9th in China  while QS World University Rankings has it ranked 400th in the world. More than 2,000 international students from 120 countries pursue degrees at HUST.Wuhan University is another Project 985 and Class A Double First Class University, which was ranked 257th by QS World University Rankings and 285th by U.S. News; established in 1893, the old Wuhan University absorbed three other schools (two of them being its spin-offs since the 1950s) in 2000 to become a university with 36 schools in 6 faculties. Since the 1950s it has received international students from more than 109 countries.\n\n\n=== Scientific research ===\n\nWuhan contains three national development zones and four scientific and technological development parks, as well as numerous enterprise incubators, over 350 research institutes, 1470 high-tech enterprises, and over 400,000 experts and technicians.\nFounded in 1958, the Wuhan Branch of Chinese Academy of Sciences is one of the twelve national branches of CAS. It is composed of 9 independent organizations, including the headquarters at Xiaohongshan, Wuchang. It has had a staff of 3,900, among which 8 are CAS fellows, and one is a Chinese Academy of Engineering fellow. As of 2013, the achievements gained by WHB had won 23 National Awards and 778 Provincial Awards. Wuhan Research Institute of Post and Telecommunications (now known as FiberHome Technologies Group) is the national center for optical communication research in China, and is where the first optical fiber in the country was produced.Wuhan University of Technology is another major national university in the area. Founded in the year 2000, it was merged from three major universities, Wuhan University of Technology (established in 1948), Wuhan Transportation University (established in 1946) and Wuhan Automotive Polytechnic University (established in 1958). Wuhan University of Technology is one of the leading Chinese universities accredited by the Ministry of Education and one of the universities constructed with priority by \"State Project 211\" for Chinese higher education institutions. The University has three main campuses located in the Wuchang District.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe headquarters of Hubei Television is located in Wuchang District. Tortoise Mountain TV Tower is China's first self-developed TV tower, opened in 1986. The modern newspapers in Wuhan can be dated back to 1866, when Hankow Times, a newspaper in English, was founded. Before 1949, more than 50 newspapers and magazines were published by foreigners in Wuhan. Chao-wen Hsin-pao, founded by Ai Xiaomei in 1873, was the first Chinese newspaper to appear in Hankou (one of the cities that was merged into Wuhan). During the Northern Expedition era (1926\u20131928), journalism in Wuhan came to a climax; more than 120 newspapers and periodicals, including national newspapers such as Central Daily News and Republican Daily News, were founded or published during this time. Chutian Metropolis Daily and Wuhan Evening News are two major local commercial tabloid newspapers. Both of them have entered the list of 100 most widely circulated newspapers of the world.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe plum blossom is the city's emblem, chosen partly because of the long history of local plum cultivation and use, and partly to recognize the plum's current economic significance in terms of cultivation and research. Local wild plums were used medicinally during the Qin and Han dynasties. Cultivation of the fruit began during the Song dynasty. Some traditional new year customs revolve around the planting of plums.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nWuhan natives speak a variety of Southwestern Mandarin Chinese referred to as Wuhan dialect that differs slightly between the districts of Wuhan, including Wuchang dialect in Wuchang District, Hankou dialect in the Hankou districts, Hanyang dialect in Hanyang District, and Qingshan dialect in Qingshan District.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nHubei cuisine is one of China's ten major styles of cooking. With a history of more than 2,000 years, Hubei cuisine, originating in ancient Chu cuisine, has developed a number of distinctive dishes, such as steamed blunt-snout bream in clear soup, preserved ham with flowering Chinese cabbage, and others. On the third day of the third month of the lunar calendar, many in Wuhan eat d\u00ecc\u00e0i zh\u01d4 j\u012bd\u00e0n (\u5730\u83dc\u716e\u9e21\u86cb), an egg dish which is supposed to prevent illness in the coming year.\"No need to be particular about the recipes; all foods have their own uses. Rice wine and tangyuan are excellent midnight snacks, while fat bream and flowering Chinese cabbages are great delicacies.\" This attitude expressed in Hankou Zhuzhici reflects indirectly the eating habits and a wide variety of distinctive snacks with a long history in Wuhan, such as Qingshuizong (a pyramid-shaped dumpling made of glutinous rice wrapped in bamboo or reed leaves) in the Period of the Warring States, Chunbinbian in Northern and Southern dynasties, mung bean jelly in the Sui dynasty, youguo (a deep-fried twisted dough stick) in the Song and Yuan dynasties, rice wine and mianwo in the Ming and Qing dynasties, as well as three-delicacy stuffed skin of bean milk, tangbao (steamed dumpling filled with minced meat and gravy) and hot braised noodles (reganmian) in modern times.\nGuozao (\u904e\u65e9) is a popular way to say 'having breakfast' in Wuhan, and a part of the city's culture. As a hub for land transport in China, Wuhan has gathered and mixed together various habits and customs from neighboring cities and provinces in all directions, which gives rise to a concentration of diverse cuisines from different places. The most famous place to guozao (have breakfast) is Hubu Street (\u6236\u90e8\u5df7), a 150-meter-long street in the neighborhood of Simenkou (\u53f8\u95e8\u53e3). Along its short length one can find nearly all the traditional foods of Wuhan, such as:\n\nHot and dry noodles, re-gan mian (\u70ed\u5e72\u9762), consists of long freshly boiled noodles mixed with sesame paste. It is considered to be the most typical local food for breakfast.\nDuck's neck or Ya Bozi (\u9e2d\u8116\u5b50) is a local version of this popular Chinese dish, made of duck necks and spices.\nBean skin or doupi (\u8c46\u76ae) is a local dish with a filling of egg, rice, beef, mushrooms and beans cooked between two large round soybean skins and cut into pieces, structurally like a stuffed pizza without enclosing edges.\nSoup dumpling or xiaolongtangbao (\u5c0f\u7b3c\u6c64\u5305) is a kind of dumpling with thin skin made of flour, steamed with very juicy meat inside, hence the name: tang (soup) bao (bun) \u2013 every time one takes a bite from it the \"soup\" inside is liable to spill out.\nA salty doughnut or mianwo (\u9eaa\u7aa9) is a kind of savory donut with a salty taste. It is much thinner than a common donut and is a typical Wuhan local food.\n\n\n=== Opera ===\nHan opera, which is the local opera of Wuhan area, was one of China's oldest and most popular operas. During the late Qing dynasty, Han opera, blended with Hui opera, gave birth to Peking opera, the most popular opera in modern China. Thus Han opera has been called the \"mother of Peking opera.\"\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nWuhan has a professional football team, Wuhan Zall F.C., that plays in the Chinese Super League. Xinhua Road Sport Center, the team's home stadium, with a capacity of 32,137, is located in the heart of the city next to Zhongshan Park. For the 2013 season, Wuhan Zall was promoted to the top-tier league of Chinese football, Chinese Super League, and relocated its home to Wuhan Sports Center Stadium, a modern stadium with 54,357 seats located in the suburbs of the city. However, the team did not play well in the ensuing season and was demoted back to China League One as the 2013 season ended. For financial and transportation reasons, the team moved back to Xinhua Road Sport Center in 2014.\nThe Wuhan Gators are a professional arena football team based in Wuhan. They are members of the China Arena Football League (CAFL).The 13,000-seat Wuhan Gymnasium held the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship and was one of the venues for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup. The 7th Military World Games were hosted in Wuhan from Oct. 18 to 27, 2019.The city has been the venue for the women's tennis tournament, the Wuhan Open, one of the WTA's Premier 5 tournaments, since 2014.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Bridges ===\n\nWuhan has eleven bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze River. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also called the First Bridge, was built over the Yangtze in 1957, carrying a railroad directly across the river between hills known as Snake Hill and Turtle Hill. Before this bridge was built it could take up to an entire day to barge railcars across. Including its approaches, it is 5,511 feet (1,680 m) long, and it accommodates both a double-track railway on a lower deck and a four-lane roadway above. It was built with the assistance of advisers from the Soviet Union.\nThe Second Bridge, a cable-stayed bridge built of prestressed concrete, has a central span of 400 meters (1,300 feet); it is 4,678 meters (15,348 feet) in length (including 1,877 meters (6,158 feet) of the main bridge) and 26.5 to 33.5 meters (86.9 to 109.9 feet) in width. Its main bridgeheads are 90 meters (300 feet) high each, pulling 392 thick slanting cables together in the shape of double fans so that the central span of the bridge is well poised on the piers and the bridge's stability and vibration resistance are ensured. With six lanes on the deck, the bridge is designed to handle the daily passage of 50,000 motor vehicles. The bridge was completed in 1995.\n\nThe Third Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also called Baishazhou Bridge, was completed in September 2000. Located 8.6 kilometers (5.3 miles) southwest of the First Bridge, construction of Baishazhou Bridge started in 1997. With an investment of over 1.4 billion yuan (about US$170,000,000), the bridge, which is 3,586 meters (11,765 feet) long and 26.5 meters (86.9 feet) wide, has six lanes and has a capacity of 50,000 vehicles a day. The bridge is expected to serve as a major passage for the future Wuhan Ring Road, greatly easing the city's traffic and aiding local economic development.\nThe Yangluo Bridge carries Wuhan's Ring Road across the Yangtze in the city's eastern suburbs (connecting the Hongshan District with the Xinzhou District). It was opened on December 26, 2007.\nThe Wuhan Tianxingzhou Yangtze River Bridge crosses the Yangtze in the northeastern part of the city, downstream of the Second bridge. It is named after Tianxing Island (Tianxingzhou), above which it crosses the river. Built at a cost of 11 billion yuan, the 4,657-meter cable suspension bridge was opened on December 26, 2009, in time for the opening of the Wuhan Railway Station. It is a combined road and rail bridge, and carries the Wuhan\u2013Guangzhou High-Speed Railway across the river.\n\n\n=== Skyscrapers ===\n\nThe Yellow Crane Tower, historically one of the tallest buildings in Wuhan, is considered one of the Four Great Towers of China and was destroyed twelve times, both by warfare and by fire. The tower is classified as an AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration. At 438 meters (1,437 ft) in height, the Wuhan Center skyscraper, the tallest structure in Wuhan and in Central China, is the eighth tallest structure in China. The Minsheng Bank Building, the second tallest structure in Wuhan, was the tallest building in Wuhan when it was completed in 2007. It retained the title until Wuhan Center surpassed it in 2014. Wuhan World Trade Tower is a 273-meter (896 foot) tall skyscraper located in Wuhan. It became the tallest building in Wuhan after its completion in 1998. However, it was surpassed by the Minsheng Bank Building in 2007.\nThe Wuhan Greenland Center is a planned 636-meter (2,087 ft), 126-floor mixed-use skyscraper currently under construction and scheduled for completion in 2019. If completed as planned, it will be among the world's tallest structures, and one of the world's tallest buildings by occupiable floor height. The Phoenix Towers are proposed supertall skyscrapers planned for construction in Wuhan. At 1 kilometer (3,300 ft) high, the towers would also be among the tallest structures in the world when completed.\n\n\n== Notable Wuhanese ==\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nLi Yuanhong \u2013 former President of the Republic of China (1916\u201317, 1922\u201323).\nWu Yi \u2013 former Vice-Premier and Minister of Health of the People's Republic of China\n\n\n=== Business ===\nWei Brian - Chinese entrepreneur\n\n\n=== Science ===\nChang-Lin Tien \u2013 seventh Chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley (1990\u20131997) and a major founder of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering (NAE).

        "wiki": "The COVID-19 pandemic originated with a cluster of mysterious, suspected pneumonia cases in the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, China. A Wuhan hospital notified the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) and health commissions on 27 December 2019. On 31 December, the Wuhan CDC disclosed to the media that there was a cluster of unknown pneumonia cases related to Huanan Seafood Market after the unverified documents appeared on the Internet. The potential disease outbreak soon drew nationwide attention including that of the National Health Commission (NHC) in Beijing who sent experts to Wuhan on the following day. Chinese authorities formally notified the World Health Organisation on this same day. On 8 January, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of the pneumonia. The sequence of the virus was soon published on an open-access database.Public and media criticism has labelled responses by the Wuhan and Hubei authorities as delayed and as failing to contain the outbreak in its early stage. By 29 January, the virus spread to all provinces of mainland China. All provinces of mainland China initiated the highest response level to public health emergency. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\" on 31 January, citing reasons of spread in other countries, particularly those without robust healthcare systems. By 8 February, over 724 died from the coronavirus infection-associated pneumonia and 34,878 were confirmed to have been infected. In Hubei alone, there were 24,953 cases of infections and 699 related deaths.The Chinese government may have censored discussions about the outbreak since the beginning of its spread. On 25 January, Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping warned about a \"grave situation\" facing China. The Party Politburo formed a special leading group for epidemic control, led by Premier Li Keqiang. The 25 January Chinese New Year celebrations were cancelled. Passengers across the country have been checked for their temperatures. Commands for epidemic control (CEC) have been formed in different regions including Wuhan and Hubei. Many inter-province bus services and railway services have been suspended. By 29 January, all Hubei cities were quarantined. Curfew laws were implemented in Huanggang, Wenzhou, and other mainland cities. In February 2020, the region also saw a huge shortage of face masks and other protective gear despite itself being the world's manufacturing hub for these products. Other countries donated medical supplies to help China deal with the epidemic.On 25 February, the number of newly confirmed cases outside mainland China exceeded those from within for the first time; the WHO praised the effectiveness of measures taken in the country. By 6 March the reported number of new cases had dropped to well fewer than 100 nationally per day, down from thousands per day at the height of the crisis. On 13 March, the number of newly imported cases passed the number of domestically transmitted new cases for the first time.Fear, regional discrimination in China, and racial discrimination within and beyond China increased with the growing number of reported cases of infections despite calls for stopping the discrimination by many governments. Some rumors circulated across Chinese social media, along with endorsements and counter-rumor efforts by media and governments. The Chinese government has worked to censor and counter reporting and criticism about the crisis and portray the official response to the outbreak in a positive light. They have also provided humanitarian assistance to other countries dealing with the virus. News outlets have reported concerns that the Chinese government has deliberately under-reported the extent of infections and deaths.\n\n\n== Graphics ==\n\n\n== Context ==\n\nNew infectious diseases impose a serious threat to the health of the general public. Their origins are often mysterious despite intensive research efforts. Although human coronaviruses (CoVs) had been known as major pathogens to cause the common cold, a new species of coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV caused an epidemic involving 29 countries during 2002\u201303 which infected 8098 persons and killed 774 of them. The evidence shows that the virus might have originated from an animal coronavirus, but somehow entered the human population. Its outbreak also implies that animal coronaviruses could be a potential danger to humans.Since the 2003 SARS outbreak, the general public and the scientific community in China have been worried about the potential return of the deadly virus which motivated the Chinese government to reform its public health system to handle the next public health crisis. As part of the reform, China expanded the laboratory networks to handle the pathogens of the infectious diseases which included a newly-built BSL-4 laboratory in Wuhan and a national key laboratory to investigate into pneumonia with unclear causes. Zeng Guang, the Chief Scientist at China CDC believed that a quicker publication of the epidemic information was a lesson that China learned from the SARS outbreak as the lack of information release worsened the outbreak.With the improved public health system, China managed to handle several public health emergencies. In coping with the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak starting from Mexico, China developed and distributed vaccines to 100 million people within months as an active prevention. During the 2013 H7N9 outbreak in East China, the country's health system identified the pathogen 5 days after the outbreak. Test kits for diagnosis were designed and distributed to all mainland provinces 3 days after the identification. Within months, effective vaccines were developed. Besides, Chinese academic Li Lanjuan and her group was the first to reveal the virus's transmission methods, molecular mechanisms and effective treatment.However, Southern Metropolis Daily stated that although people paid more attention to public health, the government's funding to the health system was far from enough as CDCs in smaller municipalities had to reduce their staff. 10 years after the SARS outbreak, few people wore a face mask when they had respiratory symptoms and the hospitals were cutting the fever clinics off. Despite confidence in winning the next battle against SARS, Zhong Nanshan who earned fame in fighting the SARS outbreak in 2003 still held a conservative attitude to whether the Chinese officials would lie to the people about a disease outbreak.Early cases surrounding the animal market suggested potential animal-to-human transmission while later the virus is found to be able to transmit from ill people to others. There have been cases where asymptomatic patients transmitted the virus to others. According to China NHC, the virus transmits by droplets or close contact while some proposed that feces could also be where the virus hides and transmits from. The typical symptoms of the viral infection included fever, dry cough, dyspnea, headache and pneumonia which are usually developed after an incubation time lasting as long as 2 weeks. The existence of mild but infectious cases complicated the epidemic control efforts. It is also noticed that patients might be able to transmit the virus even during the incubation period.\n\n\n== Early response by Wuhan ==\n\n\n=== Discovery ===\n\nThe first confirmed patient started experiencing symptoms on 1 December 2019, though the South China Morning Post later reported that the first case may have been a 55-year-old patient from Hubei province as early as 17 November. More recently, on 27 March 2020, news outlets citing a government document reported that a 57-year-old woman, who started having symptoms on 10 December 2019 and subsequently tested positive for the coronavirus disease, was described in The Wall Street Journal on 6 March 2020, may have been patient zero in the coronavirus pandemic. Although the first confirmed patient did not have any exposure to Huanan Seafood Market, an outbreak of the virus began among the people who had been exposed to the market nine days later. It is possible the infection may have passed from bat to human; if so, it may be related to bat guano used in traditional Chinese medicine. On 26 December, Shanghai PHC received a sample of a patient with unknown pneumonia from Wuhan CDC and Wuhan Central Hospital and started an investigation to the sample which was later confirmed to contain a new coronavirus.The outbreak went unnoticed until a cluster of unknown pneumonia cases was observed by Zhang Jixian, director of the Department of Respiratory Medicine at Hubei Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, whose experience fighting SARS in 2003 kept her alerted about a public health emergency. On 26 December 2019, a couple of seniors who lived near Zhang's hospital came to her for their fever and cough. The CT scan results of the couple's thorax showed unusual changes in the lungs which were different from those in any known viral pneumonia. Zhang saw the couple's son and found similar conditions. On the same day, a patient from Huanan Seafood Market that Dr. Zhang saw also had the unusual conditions.On 27 December, the doctor reported her discovery to her hospital and the hospital soon informed Jianghan CDC, thinking that this might be an infectious disease as it was indicated by the familial cluster. As a precaution, she told her colleagues to wear protective gear and prepare a specialized area in the hospital to receive patients with similar conditions.On 28 and 29 December, three more patients who had visited the Huanan Seafood Market visited the clinic of the hospital. The hospital notified the provincial and municipal health commissions. The health commissions appointed Wuhan and Jianghan CDC and Jinyintan Hospital to undertake epidemiological research for the seven patients on 29 December. Six of them were transferred to Jinyintan, a specialized facility for infectious diseases. Only one patient refused the transfer. Zhang's discovery was widely praised; the Hubei government honored her and Zhang Dingyu, the president of Jinyintan, for their contribution to controlling the viral outbreak.\n\n\n=== Disclosure ===\nOn the evening of 30 December, the two emergent notice letters from the Municipal Health Commission of Wuhan began to circulate on the Internet which was soon confirmed by Wuhan CDC who admitted that there were 27 cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on 31 December. The letters required all hospitals in Wuhan to report any pneumonia patient with unknown causes and related to Huanan Seafood Market. They also asked the hospitals to give proper treatment to these patients. Wuhan CDC told The Beijing News that the investigation was still underway and the experts from NHC were on the way to help the investigation after a rumor about it circulated on the Internet.On 1 January 2020, the seafood market was closed down by Jianghan District's Health Agency and Administration for Market Regulation due to an \"environment improvement.\" According to China Business, the workers in hazmat suits were inspecting all around the market and collecting samples. The storekeepers at the market said that they were not told what the people were collecting and detecting. The urban management officers and police officers were on the spot to ask the storekeepers to finish up and leave the market.Several doctors were warned by Wuhan's police for \"spreading misinformation\" and eight \"rumormongers\" who were all doctors at Wuhan hospitals according to Wang Gaofei, Weibo's CEO were summoned by the police on 3 January. Li Wenliang, one of the whistleblowers died from the virus on 7 February which was the same day when the discoverers of the outbreak, Zhang Jixian and Zhang Dingyu, were honored by Hubei's government. The death of Dr. Li led to widespread grief and criticism toward the government.\n\n\n== Measures and impact in Hubei ==\n\nSemi-log graph of 3-day rolling average of new cases and deaths in China during COVID-19 epidemic showing the lockdown on 23 January and partial lifting on 19 March.\n\n\n== Impact beyond Hubei ==\n\nChinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping warned that China was facing a 'grave situation'.

The passengers were checked for their temperatures to see whether they had a fever. Henan, Wuxi, Hefei, Shanghai, Inner Mongolia suspended trade of living poultry on 21 January.Financial Times described the outbreak as China's Chernobyl moment, increasing the pressure on its leader, Xi Jinping.

The Ministry of Transport asked the local governments to take the principle of \"block one, not three (Chinese: \u4e00\u65ad\u4e09\u4e0d\u65ad)\", that is, to block the virus from spreading, but not to block roads, traffic and Internet access, the transportation of emergency supplies and the transportation of essential goods. \n\n\n=== Public Health Emergency declarations ===\n\nBy 21 January, government officials warned against hiding the disease.On 22 January, Hubei launched a Class 2 Response to Public Health Emergency.

The potential delay will be the first time since 1995 when the NPC first adopted the schedule for the March session. Willy Lam, a political analyst at the Chinese University of Hong Kong believed that the sessions may not only increase the risk of infections but also \"post hostile and embarrassing questions to the top officials about the outbreak.\" He also believed that canceling the meetings would be possible although this never happened after the Cultural Revolution.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe government of China, which upholds a policy of state atheism, used the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic to continue its antireligious campaigns, demolishing Xiangbaishu Church in Yixing and removing a Christian Cross from the steeple of a church in Guiyang County. In the Shandong, \"officials issued guidance forbidding online preaching, a vital way for churches to reach congregants amid both persecution and the spread of the virus\".\n\n\n=== Economic impact ===\nThe predictions varied on how deep or long-lasting that the economic impact will be. The problem is not so much sick people, but well people who are seriously inconvenienced by anti-epidemic measures, especially disrupting travel. Millions of workers are stranded far from their jobs while the workplaces were short-handed. The data for February 2020\u2014the first full month after the virus became a major factor in January\u2014saw official indicators of economic activity fell to record lows. The Caixin manufacturing index (PMI) fell to 35.7 in February from 50 in January, showing a deep contraction. The nation's non-manufacturing index sank even further to a record low of 29.6 in February from 54.1 in January 2020. According to the Wall Street Journal, \"The factory index indicated contraction for most of 2019, hit by a trade war between the United States and China. It didn't cross back into expansion until late last year when trade tensions between the two sides eased.\"China's economic growth is expected to slow by up to 1.1 percentage in the first half of 2020 as economic activity is negatively affected by the new coronavirus outbreak, according to a Morgan Stanley study cited by Reuters. But, on 1 February 2020, the People's Bank of China said that the impact of the epidemic on China's economy was temporary and the fundamentals of China's long-term positive and high-quality growth remained unchanged.Due to the outbreak, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange announced that with the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Spring Festival holiday was extended to 2 February and trading will resume on 3 February. Before that, on 23 January, the last trading day of shares before the Spring Festival, all three major stock indexes opened lower, creating a drop of about 3% and the Shanghai index fell below 3000. On 2 February, the first trading day after the holiday, the three major indexes even set a record low opening of about 8%.

When the market opened on 3 February, the Renminbi declined against major foreign currencies. The central parity rate of the Renminbi against the US dollar opened at 6.9249, a drop of 373 basis points from the previous trading day. It fell below the 7.00 than an hour after the opening, and closed at 7.0257.The sale of new cars in China was affected by the outbreak. There was a 92% reduction on the volume of cars sold during the first two weeks of February 2020.

The Caixin PMI increased to 50 at the end of March.In Q1 2020, China GDP dropped by 6.8 percent, the first contraction since 1992.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\n\nIn January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs. Many of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers have been stranded at home in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province.By the end of March, as many as 80 million workers may have been unemployed, according to an estimate by economist Zhang Bin of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; this estimate included migrant workers and people in rural areas, whom the official statistics from Beijing do not take into account.\n\n\n=== Face mask shortage and production ===\n\nIn China, face masks have been used widely by the general public during the pandemic, and have been required in many locations. As the epidemic accelerated, the mainland market saw a shortage of face masks due to the increased need from the public. It was reported that Shanghai customers had to queue for nearly an hour to buy a pack of face masks which was sold out in another half an hour. Some stores are hoarding, driving the prices up and other acts so the market regulator said that it will crack down on such acts. The shortage will not be relieved until late February when most workers return from the New Year vacation according to Lei Limin, an expert in the industry.On 22 January 2020, Taobao, China's largest e-commerce platform owned by Alibaba Group said that all face masks on Taobao and Tmall would not be allowed to increase in price. The special subsidies would be provided to the retailers. Also, Alibaba Health's \"urgent drug delivery\" service would not be closed during the Spring Festival. JD, another leading Chinese e-commerce platform said, \"We are actively working to ensure supply and price stability from sources, storage and distribution, platform control and so on\" and \"while fully ensuring price stability for JD's own commodities, JD.com also exercised strict control over the commodities on JD's platform. Third-party vendors selling face masks are prohibited from raising prices. Once it is confirmed that the prices of third-party vendors have increased abnormally, JD will immediately remove the offending commodities from shelves and deal with the offending vendors accordingly.\" The other major e-commerce platforms including Sunning.com and Pinduoduo also promised to keep the prices of health products stable.Figures from China Customs show that some 2.46 billion pieces of epidemic prevention and control materials had been imported between 24 January and 29 February, including 2.02 billion masks and 25.38 million items of protective clothing valued at 8.2 billion yuan ($1 billion).

Between 24\u201325 January, the local governments of Shanghai, Jiangsu, Hainan and other areas announced to quarantine passengers from \"key areas\" of Hubei for 14 days. Chongqing also announced mandatory screening of every person who arrived from Wuhan since 1 January, and set up 3 treatment centers.Since 1 February, a curfew law that resembles that of Huanggang, Hubei, was put in place by the city of Wenzhou in Zhejiang, which is the second largest center after Hubei. Each local family can appoint one family member who may leave their house to purchase essential goods every two days. Since 4 February Zhejiang's capital, Hangzhou, announced the closure of all of its villages, residential communities and work units to guests. Those who enter and exit these places must show valid identification papers. Non-residents and cars will be checked strictly. On the same day, Yueqing, Ningbo, Zhengzhou, Linyi, Harbin, Nanjing, Xuzhou and Fuzhou began to take the same approach. Zhumadian, Henan, announced that each family were only allowed to have one member leave the house to purchase essential goods every 5 days.\n\nFactories were closed or reduced production for a few weeks. When they opened again, measures were implemented to reduce risk. During the pandemic, Uyghur workers were sent to resume work.Many local governments implemented restrictions to control the outbreak, including keeping schools closed, cutting off villages, and restricting travel. A smartphone-based health-tracking system was introduced in much of the country.On 2 April 2020, the government ordered a Hubei-like lockdown in Jia County, Henan, after a woman tested positive for the coronavirus. It is suspected that she may have been infected when she visited a hospital where three doctors tested positive for the virus, despite showing no symptoms. In early May, restrictions were tightened in Harbin.\n\n\n=== Impact on greenhouse gas emissions ===\nThe slowdown in manufacturing, construction, transportation and overall economic activity created a temporary reduction by \"about a quarter\" in China's greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\n=== Recovery ===\nOn 10 April, Tianshannet reported that there had been no newly confirmed cases of coronavirus in Xinjiang for the preceding 53 days and that there were no coronavirus patients in Xinjiang.As factories and other businesses reopened, extensive measures were put in place to avoid infection, including temperature checks, handwashing, disinfection, mask wearing, a mobile phone health app, avoiding public transportation, staggered lunches, physical distancing, contact tracing, and opening windows for ventilation.

In 2020, it started on 10 January and was to end on 18 February. Before the coronavirus outbreak, the government estimated 3 billion trips to be made during the period.On 9 January, Wan Xiangdong, the Chief Pilot of the Civil Aviation Administration, said that the agency would keep a close watch on the outbreak and strengthen ties with the health authorities.

Li repeated the government's previous advice to the people, that is, stay away from Wuhan. George F. Gao, the Director of China CDC also admitted to the conference that the virus can transmit between humans and there were also cases of community-acquired infections. The Chinese health officials also promised to take strict measures to stop the virus from spreading and release information as soon as possible.\n\n\n=== Epidemic control efforts ===\n\nThe NHC with the approval of the State Council announced 2019-nCoV-associated pneumonia as Category B Infectious Diseases with control measures of Class A infectious diseases as stipulated in The Law on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases. From 20 January, the NHC will publish daily data on confirmed and suspected cases in all provinces of the country (Including during the Spring Festival) until no longer necessary. On 20 January, NHC set up a working group up to deal with pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus infection. On 28 January, NHC sent seven supervision teams to seven provinces and cities in Beijing, Hebei, Shanghai, Henan, Hunan, Guangdong, and Sichuan to supervise the epidemic control measures in the areas. China normally makes 10 million face masks per day, about half of the world production. During the crisis, 2,500 factories were converted  to produce 116 million daily. Delivery drones, artificial intelligence, and facial recognition systems has also been used to help fight the epidemic.In late March, the government severely restricted international travel, limiting the number of flights to the country and denying entry to foreigners with previously issued visas and residence permits. The government also took steps to discourage Chinese people from returning from overseas. The end of March saw a new Hubei-style lockdown implemented in Jia County, Henan. The lockdown was in response to a confirmed case of coronavirus by a woman who received treatment at a hospital where three doctors have now tested positive for the coronavirus, despite showing no symptoms.\n\n\n=== Financial supports and tax reduction ===\nOn 1 February, the People's Bank of China and other five departments jointly issued the notice on further strengthening financial support for the prevention and control of the epidemic of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus infection, stating that relevant financial services will be further strengthened during the period affected by the epidemic. For those who are temporarily affected by the epidemic and facing difficulties, the document requires financial institutions to tilt their credit policies appropriately, flexibly adjust their loan repayment arrangements and reasonably postpone the repayment period. Those overdue due to inconvenient repayment during the epidemic period shall not be included in the record of credit investigation and breach of trust.On 30 January, the Ministry of Finance and NHC issued a notice on the financial guarantee policy for the prevention and control of the new type of pneumonia. The Central Government shall grant a subsidy of 300 yuan per person per day to those who are in direct contact with the cases to be investigated or confirmed who are involved in the diagnosis, treatment, nursing, hospital infection control, case specimen collection, and pathogen detection.

According to The Wall Street Journal, the appointment of Li who is considered a technocrat surprised some observers, given that he had been sidelined in recent years as Xi concentrated power and cultivated a populist ideological image. Some suggest that Xi was \"more at risk to the political fallout of the coronavirus\" while Li could be a convenient \"political scapegoat\". Li's visit to Wuhan earned high popularity on Chinese social media. Xi Jinping claimed that he \"personally commanded\" the fight against the coronavirus outbreak when meeting with WHO director general in Beijing on 28 January, but according to a report by The Guardian, he has not made any public presence since then as the social media posts mocking Xi's absence were promptly deleted by the censors.Xi's first public appearance during the outbreak was at a residential community in Chaoyang, Beijing on 10 February. Xinhua posted photos of Xi wearing a mask and said that the aim of Xi's visit was \"to learn about the situation of epidemic prevision and control at the grassroots level.\" It was his first time to interact with the people since the outbreak after he paid a short visit to Yunnan during 19\u201321 January as a tradition that China's leaders observed to visit the smaller towns and villages before the Spring Festival. He was said to chair a meeting on 3 February by the state media, but no pictures or videos were released. Xi also met Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, the first foreign leader to visit China since the coronavirus outbreak on 5 February.On 10 March, Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping visited Wuhan, over one month after Premier Li Keqiang's visit.\n\n\n=== Administrative supervision ===\nSince the outbreak of the epidemic, a number of government officials have been publicly held accountable for their dereliction of duty in the epidemic prevention in 6 provinces.On 29 January, Director of Huanggang MHC Tang Zhihong failed to tell the capacity of the local hospitals including how many patients that they could handle, how many could be hospitalized and how many patients could be tested each day when asked about these questions despite being an administrator of the local hospitals. A day later, the Party Committee of Huanggang proposed a removal of Tang from the post. On 1 February, according to the Mayor of Huanggang named Qui Lixin, the city authority disciplined 337 of its officials and removed 6 cadres who \"caused disadvantages to the epidemic prevention\".On 2 February, Zhang Cong, Party Secretary of Xuanhua, Hebei was admonished. Zhang Guoqing, Deputy Party Secretary of Xuanhua and Guo Xiaoyi, the political commissar of the local police were given disciplinary actions by the Party.

However, a record of that same meeting released beforehand shows that there was zero mention of the epidemic throughout.\n\n\n=== National mourning ===\nOn 3 April, the Chinese government declared 4 April, the Qingming Festival of 2020, a national day of mourning for those who lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic. At 10 a.m., people were asked to observe three minutes of silence while sirens and vehicle horns blasted out. Chinese flags were flown at half-mast across the country and at embassies overseas. All public entertainment were halted for the day.\n\n\n== International and regional relations ==\n\n\n=== Information sharing ===\nChina's scientists have been praised for rapidly sharing information on the virus to the international community, and leading some of the world's research on the disease.  Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on 21 January that the Chinese authorities would share information of the epidemic \"with the WHO, relevant nations and China's Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan regions in a timely manner including the genome sequence of the new coronavirus.\" During the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, Germany's health minister Jens Spahn praised China for its improved transparency since 2003. US officials and WHO also praised China for sharing data about the epidemic and keeping transparent. The US experts had been invited by China's NHC.  On 23 January, WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom and WHO regional director for the Western Pacific, Takeshi Kasai arrived in Beijing to discuss the new coronavirus outbreak with the Chinese authorities and health experts. China agreed on 28 January that WHO would send international experts to China.John Mackenzie, a member of the World Health Organization's emergency committee criticized China for being too slow to share all of the infected cases, especially during major political meetings in Wuhan after Tedros Adhanom praised China for helping \"prevent the spread of coronavirus to the other countries.\" US President Donald Trump said that China was \"was very secretive and that's unfortunate\" regarding the information on the pandemic. Yanzhong Huang, a health expert at Seton Hall University, said that China could have been more forceful and \"when there was a cover-up and there was inaction\".A number of other countries' governments have called for an international examination of the virus's origin and spread.\n\n\n=== Evacuations ===\n\nMultiple countries evacuated or are trying to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan including South Korea, Japan, the US, the UK, Kazakhstan, Germany, Spain, Canada, Russia, the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, France, Switzerland and Thailand. Korean media Channel A said that China asked the evacuation flights to arrive in the evening and leave Wuhan in the next morning so the evacuation would not be seen by the public. According to BBC, any Chinese national, even with a UK citizenship is not allowed to be evacuated by the UK.\n\n\n==== Taiwan ====\n\nAfter initially refusing to allow Taiwanese citizens to evacuate due to the One-China policy, the Chinese government eventually allowed Taiwan to evacuate its nationals from Wuhan with the assistance of the local Taiwan Affairs Office. There were around 500 Taiwanese trapped in Wuhan. The first flight to help them leave left Wuhan on 3 February. All of them would be quarantined for two weeks after they enter Taiwan.The evacuation halted after the first flight was found to carry an infected case. The Taiwanese government said that the person was not in the evacuation list and the most vulnerable were not included in the first flight. It also said that it was not prepared to take these people with a high risk of viral infections home. Tsai Ing-wen criticized China's attempt to rule Taiwan out in WHO and said, \"The information obtained by the WHO was obviously inaccurate ... and could cause the WHO to make mistakes in dealing with the global epidemic.\" Premier Su Tseng-chang called for a government-to-government negotiation for the following arrangement of chapter flights despite the fact that the cross-strait communication mechanism between governments had been suspended since 2016 when Tsai was elected president.The State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office urged the Taiwanese government to stop impeding the evacuation. The office said that before the flight, all of the passengers signed a personal declaration claiming that they have no contact with any confirmed or suspected cases and promising to comply with quarantine measures after returning to the island. All of the passengers are checked for their temperature three times before the flight and showed no abnormality. The office said critically that the Taiwanese government first expressed appreciation before the flight, but changed its attitude after the flight. Wuhan's Taiwan Affairs Office asked Taiwan for more details about the infected case as the basic descriptions of the patient including age and gender were not given as previously 17 cases in Taiwan. The office also said that the patient's close relatives were not at all informed of the viral infection.\n\n\n=== Immigration control ===\n\nThe State Administration of Immigration promised that the border inspection agencies at all ports of entry and exit in China would continue to provide necessary facilities and services for Chinese citizens returning home. On 25 January, the General Administration of Customs reactivated the health declaration system where people entering or exiting mainland China are asked to write a health declaration. Border control staff shall also cooperate in health and quarantine work such as body temperature monitoring, medical inspection, and medical check-up. On 31 January, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it was arranging charter flights to take the Chinese citizens from Hubei and Wuhan back to Wuhan 124, given the practical difficulties that they faced overseas.Hubei suspended the processing of applications from mainland Chinese residents for entry and exit of mainland China. For those with a valid visa to enter Hong Kong and Macao, but fail to enter the areas due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Chinese Immigration Administration will issue a new visa for free on request of the visa holder after the outbreak is lifted. Some of automated border clearance systems will be shut down according to the needs of the epidemic prevention. After Wuhan declared lockdown on 23 January, the Tianhe Airport and Hankou River ports have been without passengers for several days.Since 25 January, Taiwan's government banned anyone from mainland China entering the country with the ban extended to mainland Chinese overseas. Although the global health officials advised not to apply travel restrictions on China, the US and Australia restricted all Chinese citizens from China from entering their borders. Travel restrictions were announced by Russia, Japan, Pakistan and Italy and other countries despite China's criticism of border control.Since 28 January, the Hong Kong government began to cut traffic down connecting mainland China. On the same day, China's National Immigration Administration announced that with immediate effect, the application of mainland residents' visa to Hong Kong and Macau would be suspended. On 3 February, Hong Kong closed most of its border to mainland China. However, Hong Kong nurses still held a strike, demanding a complete closure.\n\n\n=== International aid ===\nChina received funds and equipment in donations from a number of other countries to help fight the pandemic. The United Front Work Department (UFWD) also coordinated diplomatic channels, state-owned businesses and Chinese diaspora community associations in urging overseas Chinese to buy masks and send them to China. Jorge Guajardo, Mexico's former ambassador to China, suggested that \"China was evidently hiding the extent of a pandemic...while covertly securing PPE at low prices\", according to Global News. Guajardo called it a \u201csurreptitious\u201d operation that left \u201cthe world naked with no supply of PPE.\u201dChina has also sent tests, equipment, and experts to other countries to help fight the pandemic. European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d expressed gratitude and praised collaboration between the EU and China. Chinese aid has also been well-received in parts of Latin America and Africa. Chinese-Americans also marshalled networks in China to obtain medical supplies.On 13 March, China sent medical supplies, including masks and respirators to Italy, together with a team of Chinese medical staff. While the head of the Italian Red Cross, Francesco Rocca said these medical supplies were donated by the Chinese Red Cross, there were other sources that said that these were paid products and services. Chinese billionaire and Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma also donated 500,000 masks and other medical supplies, which landed at Liege Airport in Belgium on 13 March and then sent to Italy. Italian Prime Minister Conte thanked China for its support and assistance. On 6 April 2020, The Spectator USA, citing an unnamed senior Trump administration official, said that China forced Italy to buy back Personal Protective Equipment which it had donated to China before. Similarly, former Mexican ambassador Jorge Guajardo said that masks sent to China in January and February were being sold back to Mexico at 20 to 30 times the price.A U.S. congressional report released in April concluded that \"the Chinese government may selectively release some medical supplies for overseas delivery, with designated countries selected, according to political calculations.\"The German tabloid Bild published an editorial critical of the Chinese government titled \"What China owes us\", which drew a rebuttal from the Chinese embassy in Berlin.On 18 May 2020, the Chinese government pledged US$2 billion to help other countries with fighting COVID-19 and other development.\n\n\n=== Problems with equipment ===\nOfficials in Spain, Turkey, and the Netherlands have rejected Chinese-made equipment for being defective. The Dutch Ministry of Health announced it had recalled 600,000 face masks which were made in China. The Spanish government said they bought thousands of test kits to combat the virus, but later revealed that almost 60,000 did not produce accurate results. The Chinese embassy in Spain said that the company that made the kits was unlicensed, and that these kits were separate from the ones donated by the Chinese government. The government of the United Kingdom paid two companies in China at least $20 million for test kits later found to be faulty.\n\n\n== Discrimination ==\n\n\n=== Hubei residents ===\nAlthough there has been support from Chinese online towards those in virus-stricken areas, instances of regional discrimination have also arisen. According to World Journal, there have been instances of Wuhan natives in other provinces being turned away from hotels, having their ID numbers, home addresses and telephone numbers deliberately leaked online or dealing with harassing phone calls from strangers. Some places also reportedly had signs saying \"people from Wuhan and cars from Hubei are not welcomed here.\" Multiple hotels purportedly refused a Wuhan tour guide to check in after she returned to Hangzhou from Singapore with one of them calling the police to give her a health check and asking the police to quarantine her. Amidst these incidents, various cities and prefectures outside of Hubei adopted resettlement measures for Hubei people in their region such as designated hotel accommodation for visitors from the province. In Zhengding, Jingxing and Luquan of Shijiazhuang City, the local governments rewarded anyone who reported those who had been to Wuhan, but not recorded in official documents at least 1,000 yuan RMB. In Meizhou, residents reporting people entering from Hunan were awarded with 30 face masks.It was reported that on a scheduled 27 January China Southern Airlines flight from Nagoya to Shanghai, some Shanghainese travellers refused to board with 16 others from Wuhan. Two of the Wuhan travellers were unable to board due to a fever while the Shanghainese on the spot alleged that the others had taken medicine to bypass the temperature check. One of the Wuhan tourists protested on Weibo, \"are they really my countrymen?\", to which a Shanghai tourist who was purportedly at the scene replied that they did it to protect Shanghai from the virus. Many netizens criticized the Wuhan tourists for travelling with a fever, although some also called for understanding and for Shanghainese not to regionally discriminate.\n\n\n=== Outside mainland China ===\nMainland Chinese overseas have experienced discrimination and anti-Chinese sentiment during the coronavirus outbreak. In Hong Kong, a Japanese noodle restaurant claimed to refuse mainland Chinese customers and said on Facebook, \"We want to live longer. We want to safeguard local customers. Please excuse us.\" In Japan, a sweet shop in Hakone and a ramen restaurant in Sapporo posted \"no Chinese\" signs outside. Similar events were reported in South Korea. The French newspaper Courrier Picard published two articles titled \"Yellow Alert\" and \"New Yellow Peril?\" which may allude to historical racist tropes about the Chinese.Beyond only Chinese, Asians in general are affected by anti-Chinese sentiment. Disinformation about Asian food and Asian communities have circulated, and videos showing Asian people eating bats have gone viral along with dehumanizing comments and implications of the cause of the virus outbreak.\n\n\n=== Targeting of Africans ===\n\nGuangzhou has a sizeable community of black Africans including migrants, who were allegedly singled out by local authories. According to Chinese state media, five Nigerian men who had tested positive for COVID-19 broke quarantine and infected others, which triggered suspicion and anti-foreigner sentiment. Africans were forced to undergo coronavirus testing and quarantine, regardless of their travel history, symptoms, or contact with known patients. Some restaurants \u2013 including a branch of McDonald's \u2013 reportedly refused to service Africans, while landlords and hotels targeted Africans for eviction resulting in some becoming homeless. Xinhua reported 111 Africans tested positive for the coronavirus in Guangzhou out of a total of 4,553 tested, also claiming that 19 of the cases were \u201cimported\u201d from unspecified countries.After a report in early April that a Nigerian coronavirus patient had attacked and bit the face of a Chinese nurse while attempting to escape hospital quarantine, social media platform Weibo saw an increase in xenophobic and racist sentiment. It has been noted that public sensitivity in China to racism, particularly to Africans, has been low with little education against racism or use of political correctness, while government censors appear to tolerate racism online. In the last few years, many Chinese believe that foreigners have been given extra benefits, leading to concerns about unfairness and inequality. Many Chinese internet users soon posted racist comments, including calls for all Africans to be deported, while a cartoon depicting foreigners as different types of trash to be sorted through went viral on social media.Local media in African countries were the first to report on the issue, while Beijing initially attempted to deny such reports as \"rumors\" and \"misunderstandings\" spread by Western media. As further incidents of Africans being targeted were shared on social media, the United States Consulate General in Guangzhou warned African Americans to avoid travel to Guangzhou. The governments of Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Kenya, Uganda and the African Union placed diplomatic pressure on Beijing over the incidents, and group of African ambassadors in Beijing wrote a letter of complaint to the Chinese government about the \u201cstigmatisation and discrimination\u201d being faced by Africans. The Nigerian Speaker of the House Femi Gbajabiamila showed one of the social media videos to the Chinese ambassador while the Ghanaian Minister for Foreign Affairs Shirley Ayorkor Botchway described the incidents as \u201cinhumane treatment\u201d.China's state media later described the incidents as \u201csmall rifts\u201d, while officials made PR visits to quarantined Africans with flowers and food accompanied by television cameras, and Chinese envoys have continued to reassure their African counterparts that they would correct the \u201cmisunderstandings\u201d and establish \u201can effective communication mechanism with African Consulates-General in Guangzhou\u201d.\n\n\n== Controversies and criticism ==\n\n\n=== Censorship and police responses ===\n\nA pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December. The early response by city authorities was accused of prioritising a control of information on the outbreak. A group of eight medical personnel, including Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist from Wuhan Central Hospital, who in late December posted warnings on a new coronavirus strain akin to SARS, were warned by Wuhan police for \"spreading rumours\" for likening it to SARS.By the time China had informed the World Health Organization of the new coronavirus on 31 December 2019,  Nicholas Kristof commented that the government was still keeping \"its own citizens in the dark\" in an opinion published on The New York Times. While by a number of measures, China's initial handling of the crisis was an improvement in relation to the SARS response in 2003, China covered up and downplayed the initial discovery and severity of this outbreak. This has been attributed to the censorship institutional structure of the country's press and Internet, with Jude Blanchette of the Center for Strategic and International Studies quoted stating \"under Xi Jinping, the inclination to suppress has become endemic and, in this case, contributed to a prolonged period of inaction that allowed the virus to spread\". William Summers, a Yale University professor of medicine, told Undark Magazine though that such silencing and downplaying tactics are \"not unique to China\", and \"seems to be standard operating procedure\u201d worldwide.On 20 January, Xi Jinping made his first public remark on the outbreak and spoke of \"the need for the timely release of information\". Chinese premier Li Keqiang also urged efforts to prevent and control the epidemic. One day later, the CPC Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, the most powerful political organ in China overseeing legal enforcement and the police, wrote \"self-deception will only make the epidemic worse and turn a natural disaster that was controllable into a man-made disaster at great cost,\" and \"only openness can minimise panic to the greatest extent.\" The commission then added, \"anyone who deliberately delays and hides the reporting of cases out of self-interest will be nailed on a pillar of shame for eternity.\" Also on the same day, Xi Jinping instructed authorities \"to strengthen the guidance of public opinions\", language which some view as a call for censorship after commentators on social media became increasingly pointedly critical and angry at the government due to the epidemic. Some view this as contradictory to the calls for \"openness\" that the central government had already declared.As part of the central government's \"bifurcated approach to diffuse discontent\", while the propaganda machinery was going into \"overdrive...to protect [Xi Jinping's] reputation\", citizens were permitted to criticise local officials so long as they did not \"question the basic legitimacy of the party\". The Cyberspace Administration (CAC) declared its intent to foster a \"good online atmosphere,\" with CAC notices sent to video platforms encouraging them to \"not to push any negative story, and not to conduct non-official livestreaming on the virus.\" Censorship has been observed being applied on news articles and social media posts deemed to hold negative tones about the coronavirus and the governmental response, including posts mocking Xi Jinping for not visiting areas of the epidemic, an article that predicted negative effects of the epidemic on the economy, and calls to remove local government officials. Chinese citizens have reportedly used innovative methods to avoid censorship to express anger about how government officials have handled the initial outbreak response, such as using the word 'Trump' to refer to Xi Jinping, or 'Chernobyl' to refer to the outbreak as a whole. Younger individuals have also been creating digital archives of media concerning the epidemic \u2013 which is prone to deletion by censors \u2013 and posting them on the exterior web. While censorship had been briefly relaxed giving a \"window of about two weeks in which Chinese journalists were able to publish hard-hitting stories exposing the mishandling of the novel coronavirus by officials\", since then private news outlets were reportedly required to use \"planned and controlled publicity\" with the authorities' consent.On 30 January, China's Supreme Court, delivered a rare rebuke against the country's police forces, calling the \"unreasonably harsh crackdown on online rumours\" as undermining public trust. In what has been called a \"highly unusual criticism\" by observers, supreme court judge Tang Xinghua said that if police had been lenient against rumours and allowed the public to have taken heed of them, an earlier adoption of \"measures like wearing masks, strictly disinfecting and avoiding wildlife markets\" might have been useful in countering the spread of the epidemic. The Human Rights Watch reported that \"there is considerable misinformation on Chinese social media and authorities have legitimate reasons to counter false information that can cause public panic,\" but also noted censorship by the authorities on social media posted by families of infected people who were potentially seeking help as well as by people living in cordoned cities who were documenting their daily lives amidst the lockdown.Journalists in China have worked to publish information about the outbreak. The government initially allowed greater leeway than usual to reporters investigating the crisis, but then cracked down with greater censorship than usual. On 12 March, ten Tibetans were arrested for breaching control measures meant to prevent the spread of the virus. Dolma Kyab, a Tibetan writer and teacher, told Radio Free Asia that \"the Chinese government is only using coronavirus as a convenient excuse to infringe on the human rights of Tibetans\".\n\n\n==== Response to whistleblowers ====\n\nOn 18 December 2019, Ai Fen, director of the emergency department of Central Hospital of Wuhan came into contact with an unusual pulmonary infection from a delivery person of Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. On 27 December, she received a second patient with similar symptoms, but who had no link to the wet market. In the afternoon of 30 December, upon  seeing the words \"SARS coronavirus, pseudomonas aeruginosa\", Ai immediately reported to the hospital's public health department and infection department. She circled the word \"SARS\", and took an image of it and forwarded it to another doctor in Wuhan. From there it spread throughout medical circles in Wuhan, and reached Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist at the hospital. On the afternoon of the same day, Li sent a warning to former classmates over WeChat which was reposted widely. In an interview with Renwu magazine, Ai said she was reprimanded after alerting her superiors and colleagues of the SARS-like virus in December. Li Wenliang would later be canonised on the internet as a heroic whistleblower, and Ai would be lauded as the one who provided the whistle.On 1 January, it's reported by Global Times that eight people were arrested by Wuhan police for their claim that there were SARS cases in Wuhan. Li Wenliang said he didn't know whether he was one of them or not. According to Wang Gaofei, Weibo's CEO, the eight people are all doctors at Wuhan hospitals who \"are still fighting at the frontline\". The Supreme Court defended these doctors and pointed out in a WeChat article on 28 January, delay and opacity in public information are the root of fake news and the information that is mostly factual and not subjectively malicious and causes no objectively severe consequences should be tolerated. On 29 January, the eight doctors were also praised by Zeng Guang, Chief Scientist at China CDC. Hu Xijin, the editor of the Global Times, complained about the local governments' low tolerance of differing online opinions and believed this weakened checks-and-balances of government powers through news media.\n\n\n==== Death of Li Wenliang ====\nAfter Li Wenliang was warned by Wuhan police, the doctor was diagnosed with the coronavirus infection and died from it on 7 February 2020. He was said to be dead on the evening of 6 February, although the hospital said that he was still under emergency treatment. People speculated that Dr. Li was actually kept alive while the authorities were trying to censor the news. After his death, people mourned his death and criticized the government. some of the trending hashtags on Weibo such as \"Wuhan government owes Dr. Li Wenliang an apology\" and \"We want freedom of speech\" became trending topics on Weibo until the posts were deleted by censors. While media outlets were allowed to report his death, the nature of the doctor's censorship which produced widespread public anger in the aftermath, in what has been described as \"one of the biggest outpourings of online criticism of the government in years,\" was not a topic that was permitted for coverage.A group of Chinese academics including Xu Zhangrun of Tsinghua University signed an open letter calling for the central government to issue an apology to Dr. Li and to protect freedom of speech. Professor Zhou Lian of Renmin University has observed that the epidemic has \"allowed more people to see the institutional factors behind the outbreak and the importance of freedom of speech\". After attempts to discourage the discussion on Dr. Li's death further escalated online anger, the central government has been accused of reportedly attempting to co-opt the incident by \"cast[ing] Dr. Li's death as the nation's sacrifice \u2013 meaning, the Chinese Communist Party's own\". The Financial Times believed Li's story fitted the historical archetypes in China where incorruptible Confucian scholar who speaks truth to the emperor but is persecuted and ultimately dies for his honesty.Later in March, Wuhan police apologised to Li Wenliang's family after National Supervisory Commission admitted the conduct of local officials is inadequate and praised the whistleblower's effort on raising public awareness.\n\n\n==== Zhang Ouya's criticism ====\nIn January, Zhang Ouya, the Chief Journalist of Hubei Daily called for the removal of the current leaders of Hubei and Wuhan on Weibo. But, he was asked to remove his post and the newspaper that he worked for apologized to the Wuhan authorities, promising that they will publish only positive content from now on. Mayor Zhou of Wuhan said to the state media \"As a local government, I could not disclose information until I get information and authorization which was not understood at the time.\" His argument which hinted at the Central Government's responsibility, was refuted by China CDC. Chief Scientist Zeng Guang said to Chinese tabloid The Global Times that what the scientists said was \"often only part of their decision-making\" and praised the eight whistleblowers who were warned by the Wuhan authorities before the epidemic.\n\n\n==== Undercounting of cases and deaths ====\nOn 1 April, two United States officials claimed China deliberately concealed its cases and deaths according to a report by United States Intelligence Community, leading other countries to underestimate the seriousness of the outbreak. The officials asked not to be identified because the report is secret, and declined to detail its contents. The sources stated that the Chinese central government does not know the extent of the outbreak because lower level officials reported falsified statistics to avoid losing their positions. The CIA is currently investigating in China to assess the coronavirus totals.During the pandemic, no reports of cases of the coronavirus in Xinjiang prisons or of conditions in the Xinjiang re-education camps emerged. A former Xinjiang resident raised concerns about the potential spread of coronavirus in the re-education camps.As of late March, users of the social media site Sina Weibo were widely sharing an undated photograph showing long lines at the Hankou funeral home in Wuhan.\nAccording to Caixin Global, the Hankou funeral home was operating 19 hours a day. Caixin also reported that there were a number of people who died with COVID-19 symptoms but were not tested and excluded from the official case tally. There were also patients who died of other diseases due to a lack of proper treatment when hospitals were overwhelmed dealing with those who had the coronavirus. Some social media users have used the numbers of urns returned to families and the number of cremations conducted in Wuhan to estimate a death toll in Wuhan of about 42,000 or 46,800, compared to an official toll of 2,548 people succumbed to the virus in Wuhan as of 27 March. There were 13,856 cremations in Wuhan in the fourth quarter of 2019, according to Bloomberg calculations based on data from the city's civil affairs agency. That was 2,419 lower than in the fourth quarter of 2018.Sources ranging from a number of health experts, United States intelligence officials, British scientists, and British government officials have expressed doubts about the accuracy of the figures provided by the Chinese government related to the epidemic, raising concerns that the government has deliberately under-reported the extent of infections and deaths. Although Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported on 24 March 2020 that the spread of domestically transmitted epidemic has essentially stopped and the outbreak has been controlled in China, news publications reported that experts have doubted these claims, and described them to be premature.Asymptomatic cases, people who tested positive but did not develop symptoms, were not counted as confirmed cases before 1 March.On 17 April, the Wuhan government revised the number of COVID-19 deaths, accounting for deaths that occurred at home that went previously unreported, as well as the subtraction of deaths that were previously double-counted by different hospitals, resulting in a net increase of 1,290 reported deaths in the city.\n\n\n==== Investigations of origins of the virus ====\nThe central government has imposed restrictions on the publication of academic research regarding the origins of the coronavirus. The directive issued by the Ministry of Education's science and technology department stated that \"academic papers about tracing the origin of the virus must be strictly and tightly managed\", requiring that such papers be vetted by a State Council task force. A Chinese researcher who spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation said \"I think it is a coordinated effort from (the) Chinese government to control (the) narrative, and paint it as if the outbreak did not originate in China. And I don't think they will really tolerate any objective study to investigate the origination of this disease.\" The researcher said that such a move would obstruct important scientific research. Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Washington-based Council on Foreign Relations, said \"it is no surprise that the government seeks to control related scientific research so that the findings do not challenge its own narrative on the origin of the virus and the government response to the crisis\".After interviewing virologist Shi Zhengli who had investigated bat coronaviruses including the latest one, journalist Gao Yu said \"We learned later her institute finished gene-sequencing and related tests as early as January 2 but was muzzled.\" Shi said that Yanyi Wang, Director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, had ordered staff not to disclose information on the disease arguing that \"inappropriate and inaccurate information was causing 'general panic'\". Furthermore, Wang directed that \"The National Health Commission 'unequivocally requires that any tests, clinical data, test results, conclusions related to the epidemic shall not be posted on social media platforms, nor shall [it] be disclosed to any media outlets including government official media, nor shall [it] be disclosed to partner institutions'\".The broad scientific consensus holds that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats. A member of Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms (COBRA) in the UK, tasked with dealing with crisis, has said that while British government intelligence does not dispute that the virus has a zoonotic origin, it also does not discount the idea of a leak from a Wuhan laboratory, saying that \"Perhaps it is no coincidence that there is that laboratory in Wuhan\" (the Wuhan Institute of Virology). On 15 April 2020, US President Donald Trump announced that the US government was investigating whether the virus spread from the laboratory.\n\n\n=== Propaganda ===\n\nStatements issued by Xi Jinping on 3 February declared the need for an emphasis by state media on \"telling the moving stories of how [people] on the front line are preventing and fighting the virus\" as a priority of coverage, while top official Zhang Xiaoguo said that his department would \"treat propaganda regarding the control and prevention measures of the virus as its top priority\". For instance, state media organisations People's Daily and Global Times, along with deputy director of information Zhao Lijian from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, have been observed to be publishing effusive praise on Beijing's response to the epidemic, such as extensive coverage of the accelerated construction of the new hospitals in Wuhan (which Zhao claimed was completed in 16 hours), the lock down of Wuhan with its population of 11 million, and the \"unprecedented\" quarantine of Hubei province. Though such efforts had a questionable effect on the epidemic, as the new hospitals were operating at under half-capacity due to shortages of beds and medical resources while the lock down of Wuhan came too late to be effective as millions had left, the Financial Times and others noted that such widely publicised actions were a \"PR coup\" showing that the \"overbearing, centralized government\" of China was particularly suited to dealing with the outbreak, creating the impression as if Beijing had directly intervened at Xi Jinping's request.Observers have warned that while \"admiration of the front-line medical workers is widespread and sincere,\" the state media should also be highlighting the reality that many of those workers \"lack protective gear\" and that over 3000 have been infected since the outbreak so that media attention may bring them public support to obtain some much needed equipment. The New York Times has noted that such government propaganda attempts to control the narrative has been viewed with distrust among the younger individuals, who unlike older people depend less on state media and instead have sought \"firsthand info and in-depth media studies concerning the epidemic on the web\", suggesting that the central government was out of touch with the younger population.Outlets such as Politico and Foreign Policy have reported that China's efforts to send aid to virus-stricken countries are part of a propaganda push for global influence. The European Union's diplomatic service, the European External Action Service (EEAS) has fought back against propaganda highlighting China's role in providing medical supplies to Italy, pointing out that France and Germany combined had provided more masks to Italy than China. The EEAS also noted that China's \u201cstate media and government officials promote not proven theories about the origin of Covid-19\u201d while China state media coverage highlighted \u201cdisplays of gratitude by some European leaders in response to Chinese aid\u201d. China has been accused of \"opportunitism\" during the pandemic, alongside their donations and exports of faulty medical equipment to EU nations hardest hit by the virus, as their disinformation campaign \"reputedly bid to denigrate Europe\u2019s responses to cast its own in a more favorable light\", such as on 12 April 2020 when the Chinese embassy in Paris published an article titled \"Restoring distorted facts - Observations of a Chinese diplomat posted to Paris\" claiming that careworkers in Western nursing homes had abandoned their jobs leaving residents to die. The EEAS had toned down their report by omitting details of China's state sponsored disinformation campaign, which in turn led to allegations that the EEAS had bowed to pressure from China, as China reportedly threatened to withhold the shipment of medical supplies if the original report was released.\n\n\n=== Hubei and Wuhan governments ===\nThe exodus from Wuhan before the lockdown resulted in angry responses on Sina Weibo from the residents in the other cities who are concerned that it could result in the spreading of the novel coronavirus to their cities. Some in Wuhan are concerned with the availability of provisions and especially medical supplies during the lockdown.The World Health Organization called the Wuhan lockdown \"unprecedented\" and said that it showed \"how committed that the authorities are to contain a viral breakout\". However, WHO clarified that the move is not a recommendation that WHO made and the authorities have to wait and see how effective that it is. The WHO separately stated that the possibility of locking an entire city down like this is \"new to science\".The CSI 300 Index, an aggregate measure of the top 300 stocks in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, dropped almost 3% on 23 January 2020, the biggest single-day loss in almost 9 months after the Wuhan lockdown was announced as the investors that are spooked by the drastic measure sought a safe haven for their investments.The unprecedented scale of this lockdown generated controversy and at least one expert criticized this measure as \"risky business\" that \"could very easily backfire\" by forcing otherwise healthy people in Wuhan to stay in close conditions with infected people. Drawing a cordon sanitaire around a city of 11 million people raises inevitable ethical concerns. It also drew comparisons to the lockdown of the poor West Point neighborhood in Liberia during the 2014 ebola outbreak which was lifted after ten days.The lockdown caused panic in the city of Wuhan and many have expressed concern about the city's ability to cope with the outbreak. It remains unknown whether the large costs of this measure, both financially and in terms of personal liberty will translate to effective infection control. A medical historian named Howard Markel argued that the Chinese government \"may now be overreacting, imposing an unjustifiable burden on the population\" and claimed that \"incremental restrictions, enforced steadily and transparently tended to work far better than draconian measures.\" Others such as Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases defended the intent behind the lockdowns, citing that the lockdowns bought the world a \"delay to essentially prepare better.\" A mathematical epidemiologist named Gerardo Chowell of Georgia State University stated that based on mathematical modelling, \"containment strategies implemented in China are successfully reducing transmission.\"Nonetheless, after northern Italy became a new hotspot of the outbreak in late February, the Italian government enacted what has been called a \"Wuhan-style lockdown\" by quarantining nearly a dozen towns of 50,000 people in the provinces of Lombardy and Veneto. Iran, another developing hotspot for the coronavirus as of 25 February came under calls to assume similar lockdown procedures as China and Italy. The security experts such as Gal Luft of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security in Washington said that \"The best way for Iran to deal with the disease is to do precisely what China did \u2013 quarantine.\" and \"If Wuhan with its 11 million population can be under quarantine so can Tehran with its 8 million\"\n\n\n==== Frozen case number ====\nThe early cases surrounding an animal market may suggest animal-to-human transmission, more evidence surfaced to support the human-to-human transmission of the virus. However, despite the expert-led investigation and early signs of human-to-human transmission including a hospital-acquired infection (nosocomial) case confirmed on 10 January according to Caixin, the local government of Wuhan denied any case of nosocomial infection and kept claiming that \"there was no clear sign of human-to-human transmission\" until 15 January when Wuhan's Municipal Health Commission (MHC) said on its website that \"the result of present investigation shows no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission, but this does not rule out the possibility of such a transmission. The risk of continuous human-to-human transmission is low.\"The reported case number froze at 41 during the Hubei Lianghui and Wuhan Lianghui, the local parliament sessions between 6\u201317 January, which the local authorities of Hubei and Wuhan claimed to be due to the lack of PCR test kits for the new virus. But, Caixin said that the other sequencing techniques can be used for diagnosis which usually takes two days without any need of PCR kits. Meanwhile, an Imperial College group and a Hong Kong University group both estimated over 1,000 cases in Wuhan as cases were being exported and confirmed overseas. Perceived discrepancies in the official Chinese data for the number of cases left many netizens doubtful, with some mockingly labeling the virus \"patriotic\" for its appearance of mainly infecting the Chinese after they left the country.\n\n\n==== \"Manageable and preventable\" ====\nOn 20 January, the Chinese National Health Commission announced that human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus had already occurred.Also 20 January, the number of reported new cases soared to 136 as major mainland cities including Beijing and Shenzhen reported their first cases. Only the Wuhan authorities stopped claiming that the virus had a limited ability to transmit between humans. On the same day, the city formed a specialized command for epidemic control (CEC) to upgrade measures to cope with the epidemic including enhanced protection over the medical workers and free treatment for all patients at the fever clinics. On the evening of that day, Zhong Nanshan, one of the NHC experts sent to Wuhan who was well known for fighting against SARS in 2003, exemplified human-to-human transmission of the new virus with a cluster of 14 hospital-acquired infections in Wuhan and two familial clusters in Guangdong.However, the National Health Commission still insisted that the epidemic should be \"manageable and preventable.\" At that time, the BBC said that not much public attention was drawn to the virus outbreak. On 19 January, despite the virus outbreak, over 40,000 Wuhan families joined an annual potluck banquet which was a community tradition observed for over two decades to celebrate the Kitchen God Festival. A community leader told The Beijing News that \"everything is normal now\" when asked about the virus outbreak. According to the community committee of Baibuting where the banquet was held as of 4 February, a block of the community had at least 10 confirmed cases of the coronavirus infection, plus over 30 highly suspicious cases, but the community hospital also said that the incidents of the coronavirus was lower than that in the other communities.Zhou Xianwang, the mayor of Wuhan who was widely criticized by the public and media due to slow responses said to the state media CCTV that the banquet was organized by the local community which had a long history of self-governance. He said that the government was not precautious enough to stop it because it was believed that the virus only had a limited ability to transmit between the people.\n\n\n==== Controversial commentary ====\nOn 20 January, Guan Yi, a Hong Kong-based expert in SARS epidemiology told Caixin that the local government should not play on words about transmissibility and he hoped that we could learn from the 2003 SARS outbreak. He continued, \"transmissibility, adaptability, incidence and virulence of the virus highly resemble those of SARS at the early stage [of the 2003 outbreak]\". Guan's team travelled to Wuhan on 21 January and returned to Hong Kong the next day. He observed that the \"epidemiology experts and scientists do not seem to be welcomed in the city.\" On 22 January, Wuhan was still \"an open city\" to the virus outbreak where most people did not wear a mask although NHC announced the coronavirus-associated pneumonia as a notifiable disease. He believed that a pandemic was unavoidable as the virus spread with the annual mass migration of the Spring Festival.The statements of Guan which were apparently different from that in most Chinese media became highly controversial as the journalists of state media reposted his statement of 15 January in which he opined that the disease was manageable,  whilst also peddling old news that his lab had been fined by the Chinese authorities in 2005. Wang Duan, the Caixin journalist who conducted the interview described such behavior as \"personal attacks\" and complained that no expert came forward to refute what Guan said so far.\n\n\n==== 26 January press meeting ====\nHubei Government's press meeting on 26 January was described as a \"scene of a massive car crash\" by BBC which led to widespread dissatisfaction. Despite the compulsory face mask law, Governor Wang Xiaodong did not wear a mask while the other two official hosts including Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang and Provincial Party Secretary Bie Bixiong wore masks incorrectly. The Governor said Xiantao, a Hubei city was capable to produce 10.8 billion masks annually after he made two corrections for the number hinted by someone else's notes. The Governor admitted a severe shortage of medical supplies in Hubei while Mayor Zhou of Wuhan claimed that the shortage had been fully alleviated.\n\n\n=== Science community ===\nOn 29 January, the Ministry of Science and Technology issued a notice, urging the scientists \"to write their papers on the land of the motherland, to use the results to fight the epidemic\" and the scientists should not focus on publishing their papers until the epidemic prevention and control task is completed. Duowei News believed this was aimed to respond to the academic conflict between Zhang Yongzhen's group from Fudan University which published the first genomic sequence of 2019-nCoV and the Gao Shan group from Nankai University which published an analysis on the sequence without authorization from Zhang. Before the notice, Nankai and Fudan, two of China's top universities had a fight over the alleged academic misconduct related to the analysis published by the Gao Shan group.On 30 January, Wang Liming, a neuroscientist from Zhejiang University expressed anger on a Weibo post about George F. Gao's latest NEJM article. Wang believed that the article indicated that the Chinese CDC had clear evidence of human-to-human transmission in early January and kept it secret until three weeks later. Although the post was soon deleted, China CDC came under the spotlight. China CDC had to respond on the next day that the research was a retrospective analysis of the 425 cases reported to CDC on 23 January. Jennifer Zeis of NEJM's media Relations Department told The Paper, a Chinese newspaper that it took only two days to publish the article, but she refused to give further details.The journal Nature reported at least 54 English-language papers about the new coronavirus in China were published by 30 January. Zuofeng Zhang, a public health expert from UCLA interviewed by the mainland China-based magazine Intellectual, asked why the published data were not used in epidemic control even before their publication.\n\n\n=== Misinformation and conspiracy theories ===\n\nThere were conspiracy theories about COVID-19 being the CIA's creation to keep China down on China's Internet, according to London-based The Economist. Although biological warfare against Chinese troops in the Korean war is only considered an allegation in the US, it is considered official history in China, thus greatly helping these new theories gain credibility.Multiple conspiracy articles in Chinese from the SARS era resurfaced during the outbreak with altered details, claiming that SARS is biological warfare conducted by the US against China. Some of these articles claim that BGI Group from China sold genetic information of the Chinese people to the US, with the US then being able to deploy the virus specifically targeting the genome of Chinese individuals.On 26 January, Chinese military news site Xilu published an article detailing how the virus was artificially combined by the US to \"precisely target Chinese people\".Some articles on popular sites in China have also cast suspicion on US military athletes participating in the Wuhan 2019 Military World Games, which lasted until the end of October 2019, and have suggested that they deployed the virus. They claim the inattentive attitude and disproportionately below-average results of American athletes in the games indicate they might have been there for other purposes and they might actually be bio-warfare operatives. Such posts stated that their place of residence during their stay in Wuhan was also close to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where the first known cluster of cases occurred.In March 2020, this conspiracy theory was endorsed by Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China. On 13 March, the US government summoned Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai to Washington DC over this conspiracy theory, when he had called this theory \"crazy\" on Face the Nation on 9 February, and re-affirmed this belief after Zhao's tweets.The United States Presidential administration, including President Donald Trump, Mike Pompeo and others also pushed a conspiracy theory repeatedly asserting that the virus had originated from a laboratory leak in Wuhan, despite widespread rejection from the scientific community and by allied intelligence.\n\n\n== Statistics ==\nThe case count in mainland China only includes symptomatic cases. It excludes patients who test positive but do not have symptoms, of which there were 889 as of 11 February 2020. It's also reported that there were more than 43,000 by the end of February 2020.  On 17 April, following the Wuhan government's issuance of a report on accounting for COVID-19 deaths that occurred at home that went previously unreported, as well as the subtraction of deaths that were previously double-counted by different hospitals, the NHC retrospectively revised their cumulative totals dating to 16 April, adding 325 cumulative cases and 1,290 deaths.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCoronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases and historical data by Johns Hopkins University\nReports on the COVID-19 pandemic in China, by the PRC National Health Commission\nCoronavirus China updates and news.

Established in 1953, the museum moved to its present location in 1960 and gained its present name in 1963.  Since 1999 a number of new buildings have been added. The museum received 1,992,512 visitors in 2017.The museum is located in the Wuchang District of Wuhan, Hubei Province, not far from the west shore of Wuhan's East Lake. It has a collection of over 200,000 objects, including the Sword of Goujian, an ancient set of bronze bells (Bianzhong) and extensive artifacts from the Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng and the tombs at Baoshan. The particular importance of several of the archaeological items in the museum's collection has been recognized by the national government by including them into the short list of Chinese cultural relics forbidden to be exhibited abroad.\nOn the afternoon of April 27, 2018, China's paramount leader Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Hubei Provincial Museum.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in China\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website of Hubei Provincial Museum\nHubei museum on China Travel Guide\nHubei Provincial Museum at Google Cultural Institute",

          "Incredible set of bells found in an accidentally discovered emperor's tomb. Local musicians played replicas of these to demonstrate these. Wonderful.",
          "Must see: The tomb exhibit. It is little wonder that gold came to be such a valuable commodity with the brilliance of these early pieces. The sheer age and beauty of the gold artefacts, including hats and jewellery is astounding. Definitely worth a look!",
          "The Museum has a magnificent collection of ancient bronzes and lacquerware. Of particular significance is a set of chimes and bells dating to 433 BC. It comprises 65 bells suspended on three frames, and divided into eight groups, and is capable of producing a stunning feast of",

          "I was so pleasantly surprised at the quality of this museum. There is a wonderful exhibit on tea. The contents of an ancient tomb. The only problem is there could be a bit more English. Still one of the better museums I've seen in China.",
          "To be honest, I did not expect this museum is such well organized, although I read about the \"bian zhong\" many years ago. The exhibition of Zeng Hou Yi was astonishingly magnificant and beautiful....Mind blowing to think about the techniques 2500 years ago to make those bronze",
          "If you have time while in wuhan, the provincial museum is highly recommended. Electronic language guides are available, making the museum easy to maneuver for nonchinese. The exhibits are first rate with several outstanding. The ancient bell ringing exhibit is first rate if you",
          "To get to the Hubei Provincial Museum, take the metro line 4 (light green line) to Dongting station. Go up to street level using Exit A or B, both of which delivers you to Huangli Road. Walk southeast along Huangli Road for about 1 km, and you will come to a major expressway.",
          "Actually there are a lot of things to see, but maybe because im not into to history so for me its quite boring For person who love history, maybe its a really good place, There are a lot of things to see, and not only related to china history there are part of human history",

          "This museum covers the cultural history of the region around Wuhan. Starting with the early ancestors of modern humans (Homo erectus, etc.) through at least the 1911 revolution (that ended the last imperial dynasty). Artifacts abound from skulls of these early men and their",
          "You can cover the museum in about an hour and is well worth the visit especially the open ancient tomb with a body so well preserved the skin and internal organs are all still there. The gift shop has many interesting things for sale.",
          "Following the concert with the bells and artists in traditional dress, we toured the museum with our guide. Essential to have a guide to get the most out of the visit to the museum and its extensive collection of artifacts.",

          "If you are the history person this is a place you must visit, some of the rooms have explanation in English but maybe 50% are Chinese Only, anyway the Museum is nice, one good think is you can take pictures.",
          "Like ALL museums in China, it's free! But the pieces on display are stunning and must see. The Hubei Museum of Art is right next to it, please do make an effort to visit. It's even better than the provincial museum with its art collections.",
          "After visiting the Shanghai Museum the day before I really did not have great expectations for this one and assumed it was just a tick box excursion from our travel company whilst we waited for our river boat to start its cruise from Wuhan. But actually I was quite wrong and it",

          "A lot of history. Worth the visit. Allow at least two hours. Would suggest you go on the guided tour. You may have to book an English speaking guide ???????",
          "Great for all family members or for a solo hike and exploration. Bring water and make sure to wear comfortable clothing. There is a charge so be aware and ready for purchasing a ticket. Reasonable price.",
          "Interesting Museum which houses ancient bronze age bells unearthed 2000 years ago from a huge tomb. The museum has a facsimile set that they play which is worth seeing/hearing. Can do the entire site in a couple hours. Can be long lines outside if you are not with a tour group.",

          "Our visit began with the bells performance, which was quite enjoyable. The museum was okay. Most of the artifacts, including bronzes, lacquerware, and an enormous set of bells were uncovered in a single tomb.",
          "This Museum is fascinating. Plan on taking a couple hours. Though it was hot outside, it was very cool inside, so dress appropriately. Great displays of the Han Dynasty!!",
          "We saw a complete set of ancient bronze bells. The museum has an exact reproduction of these bells that is used for bell concerts. We were treated to a concert on our visit. Very nice and loud. At times 4 people were hitting the gongs and bells. A must see and hear.",
          "I didn't realize how large these tombs were and all that these emperors thought they needed to take with them!! The museum had many of the items that were found in the tomb as well as the original bell chimes. The most interesting to me was the replica of the tomb. It had",
          "We came all the way for the museum. Here they have the one and only complete set of ancient bronze bells, an important ritual and ceremonial music instruments for Spring and Autumn Period of China. From the unearthed Marquis Yi's tomb, beside the bells, there are hundreds of",

          "Museum was interesting, mainly based on the history of the area. Entrance is free and it closes at 5pm. However, after 4pm, no-one is allowed in. The Bell Chimes performance is a paid performance, but well worth the money.",
          "OK museum focused on archeological finds of the region. Exhibit of the local rulers are interesting. There is a chime bell show that was quite nice. Overall, good to visit but not worth changing plans for it.",
          "The most special exhibit was the tomb of the Marquis of Yi, from 476 BC-221 BC. It included relics found in the tomb. The scale is equivalent to Egyptian pyramids and most amazingly, a complete set of 65 bronze bells, perfectly preserved. We attended a concert on replicas.",
          "We wanted to visit it on Monday but it appeared to not work on Mondays, so choose another day of the week.",
          "I liked this museum a lot for what it is. It's centered fully on what the province has to offer from an archeological perspective. It has four main centers: a ancient tomb (that predates the terra cotta warriors), human fossils that date back as far as one million years, swords",
          "Especially the rooms on the ground floor showing items from an excavation of a ca. 2500 year old tomb are amazing. All captions are in good English as well as Chinese of cause. The sophisticated techniques of the bronze items will leave the spectator speechless. The exhibition",
          "Items of interest: The bronze sword of Goujian (king of Yue State in the Spring and Autumn Period). The sword has kept stainless for thousands of years and still sharp. Chime Bells from Tomb of Yi - King of the Zen State in the Warring States Period (476BC-221BC). The largest",

          "a most to have an Impression on Chinese culture, problem to have enough time for visit, for a good base at least one full day needed",
          "The artefacts on the ground floor are world standard in interest, particularly the 2 tone bells which took my breath away. The coffins are beautiful and generate questions about connections with Egyptians. Interesting information in English helps explain the items on display.",
          "Remarkable historic findings from Marquis Yi with his bronze bells and tomb artifacts. Some very impressive bronze, lacquer and jade pieces. The highlight was the wonderful show with the bells and Chinese instruments.",
          "The museum was fascinating, as it offered a glimpse into the relics found in unearthing the tomb of Marquis Y. These many artifacts offer a view into the mindset of their rulers, as it shows much of what was placed into their tombs with them - not the least of which were the",
          "Overall, I thought this is a great and fascinating history museum to be when you want to know about ancient Chinese history with relics that depict so. Exhibits date back even before that of 400BC, started since the Shang Dynasty, the earliest period of time in China!! You can",
          "I did not know a lot about ancient Chinese History before I visited this museum but my trip was very informative. I was fortunate enough to be visiting the museum with a friend that had studied Chinese History in college. The museum's main exhibition is that of the relics found",
          "A large museum for the Chinese History lovers. Might not be very interesting for others (especially for the foreigners). But it was a good time pass. A large area with multiple floors and a shop. Lots of people (Chinese) go there.",
          "There are many interesting exhibits that date back to about 400BC. This rice cooking pot we saw was stolen and found after many years in an auction in the USA and eventually returned to China.",
          "This excellent museum has well set out displays of local history, culture, ceramics, jewellery and musical instruments. It contains the largest Chime Bell set in the world and we were able to see a short concert of traditional instruments. The temporary display of European",
          "For a museum, the exhibition would not be abundant comparing other large museums around the world. The large coffins and the largest chime-bells worth a trip. The bronze ware was also interesting. For construction reason, I did not meet the famous un-rotten sword of Guojian.",
          "Although the museum has fallen into the trap of having more public space than exhibit space, its collection is interesting because it is rich in local archeological finds and decorative arts.",
          "Allow more time at the museum to watch the 30 minutes chime bells performance in the theatre located on the left hand side of the museum. Two shows in the afternoon , 2 pm and 3pm. It cost 30rmb for the show.",

          "I am fascinated by a walk around a museum that leaves a lasting impression on me. Hubei Provincial Museum in Wuhan certainly did that! It taught me more about the friendly nature of Chinese people and their culture. Looking at the incredible bell instrument, a Chinese boy, maybe",
          "This museum was a last minute addition to our tour, and turned out to be one of the highlights of our 2 week trip through South East China. The Bianzhong (musical instrument made of bells) of Marquis Yi of Zeng is an extraordinary collection of bells dating from 433 BC and is",
          "The only problem with this museum is that it seems designed deliberately to highlight your ignorance of Chinese culture and history. I saw many items I wouldn't know how to describe and somehow the English explanations available were not always very clear. Certainly one of the",
          "Hubei is the gateway city to the Yangtze and has become much more easily visited thanks to the 3,600-foot Yangtze Bridge that allows easy passage between the major parts of the city. The Hubei Provincial Museum is a very nice repository housing many magnificent artifacts",
          "Make sure you add the concert of the ancient bells and gong to your visit to the museum. There is a small concert hall to the side of the museum and you need a ticket for the concert. The museum is large, but the collection is excellent, especially the history of porcelain.",
          "I'm only giving this a lackluster review because I wanted to warn people to check ahead of time to see if the museum is open. We went on a Sunday and the entire museum was closed for construction. I just want to save other travelers the hassle.",
          "The history of Chinese pottery is the history of ceramics themselves. Whilst not my number one interest, I was trapped by the sheer age of their beautiful art. Whilst we were erecting Stonehenge, they were creating glazed pottery and experimenting with porcelain. We would not",

          "Being a very modern city, Wuhan does not really present itself as the most historical city in China, but..This museum! It contradicts the impression the city gives to the traveller. It holds all the treasures of ancient China, remnants of a far past very hard to find in such a",

          "I would say that the Hubei provincial Museum is a worth while endeavor. Whether it's your first time to Wuhan or you've been there for many years. There are a lot of first class relics of historical importance to China. Being here you learn a lot, not only about the city itself",

Based on their relative importance, each type of protected area can be further graded into two to three levels (national, provincial and prefectural/county level).  Nevertheless, the highest rank for \"pocket nature preserve\" (social and mass-based), \"no-hunting area\", \"no-fishing area\", \"no-logging area\", \"wild medicinal material resources conservation area\", \"crop germplasm resources conservation area\", \"forest tree germplasm resources conservation area\" or \"source water protection area\" is practically restricted to provincial level.  The local government at county level is also responsible for the delimitation and declaration of \"basic farmland protection area\" and \"basic grassland\".  Qinling National Botanical Garden, said to be the world's largest (639 km2, of which 575.31 km2 being set aside for in-situ conservation purposes), was opened (Phase 1) to the public on September 27, 2017. \nTake note that many protected areas in China have multiple official designations, and the statutory boundaries of these multi-designated PAs may be identical or may vary one from the other.  For instance, the boundaries of Huangshan NP coincide with those of the Huangshan NGP, whereas Fujian province's Wuyi Mountains NNR, NP and NFP are adjacent to each other.

        "wiki": "Wuhan (simplified Chinese: \u6b66\u6c49; traditional Chinese: \u6b66\u6f22, [\u00f9.x\u00e2n] (listen)) is the capital city of Hubei Province in the People's Republic of China. It is the largest city in Hubei and the most populous city in Central China, with a population of over 11 million, the ninth most populous Chinese city and one of the nine National Central Cities of China.The name \"Wuhan\" came from the city's historical origin from the conglomeration of Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang, which are collectively known as the \"Three Towns of Wuhan\" (\u6b66\u6c49\u4e09\u9547).  It lies in the eastern Jianghan Plain, at the confluence of the Yangtze river and its largest tributary, the Han River and is known as \"Nine Provinces' Thoroughfare\" (\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862).Wuhan is considered by some to be one of the potential sites of the pivotal Battle of the Red Cliffs, which stopped warlord Cao Cao's incursion into southern China at the end of the Eastern Han dynasty. Other historical events taking place in Wuhan include the Wuchang Uprising of 1911, which led to the downfall of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China. Wuhan was briefly the capital of China in 1927 under the left wing of the Kuomintang (KMT) government led by Wang Jingwei. The city later served as the wartime capital of China for ten months in 1937 during the Second Sino-Japanese War. A novel coronavirus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic was first identified in Wuhan in December 2019.Wuhan is considered the political, economic, financial, commercial, cultural and educational center of Central China. It is a major transportation hub, with dozens of railways, roads and expressways passing through the city and connecting to other major cities. Because of its key role in domestic transportation, Wuhan is sometimes referred to as \"the Chicago of China\" by foreign sources. The \"Golden Waterway\" of the Yangtze River and the Han River traverse the urban area and divide Wuhan into the three districts of Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge crosses the Yangtze in the city. The Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest power station in terms of installed capacity, is located nearby. Historically, Wuhan has suffered risks of flooding, prompting the government to alleviate the situation by introducing ecologically friendly absorption mechanisms.While Wuhan has been a traditional manufacturing hub for decades, it is also one of the areas promoting modern industrial changes in China. Wuhan consists of three national development zones, four scientific and technological development parks, over 350 research institutes, 1,656 high tech enterprises, numerous enterprise incubators and investments from 230 Fortune Global 500 firms. It produced GDP of US$22.4 billion in 2018. The Dongfeng Motor Corporation, an automobile manufacturer, is headquartered in Wuhan. The city is home to multiple notable institutes of higher education, including Wuhan University and the Huazhong University of Science and Technology. In 2017, Wuhan was designated as a Creative City by UNESCO, in the field of design. Wuhan is classified as a Beta world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Wuhan\" is a portmanteau of the two major cities on the northern and southern banks of the Yangtze River that make up the Wuhan metropolis: \"Wu\" refers to the city of Wuchang (Chinese: \u6b66\u660c), which lies on the southern bank of the Yangtze, while \"Han\" refers to the city of Hankou (Chinese: \u6c49\u53e3), which lies on the northern bank of the Yangtze.\nIn 1926, the Northern Expedition reached the Wuhan area and it was decided to merge Hankou, Wuchang and Hanyang into one city in order to make a new capital for Nationalist China. On January 1, 1927, the resulting city was proclaimed as '\u6b66\u6f22' (the traditional Chinese characters for 'Wuhan'), which was later simplified as '\u6b66\u6c49' (also 'Wuhan').\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nThe Wuhan area has been settled for 3,500 years. Panlongcheng, an archaeological site primarily associated with the Erligang culture (c. 1510 \u2013 c. 1460 BC) (being sparsely populated during the earlier Erlitou period), is located in modern-day Huangpi District.\nDuring the Western Zhou the State of E, which gives its name to the single character abbreviation for Hubei province, controlled the present-day Wuchang area south of the Yangtze River. After the conquest of the E state in 863 BC, the present-day Wuhan area was controlled by the State of Chu for the rest of the Western Zhou and Eastern Zhou periods.  Chu was in turn conquered by Qin in 223 BCE.\n\n\n=== Imperial China ===\n\nDuring the Han dynasty, Hanyang became a fairly busy port. The Battle of Xiakou in AD 203 and Battle of Jiangxia five years later were fought over control of Jiangxia Commandery (present-day Xinzhou District in northeast Wuhan). In the winter of 208/9, one of the most famous battles in Chinese history and a central event in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms\u2014the Battle of Red Cliffs\u2014took place near the Yangtze River, with the cliffs near Wuhan identified as one of the potential locations. Around that time, walls were built to protect Hanyang (AD 206) and Wuchang (AD 223). The latter event marks the foundation of Wuhan. In AD 223, the Yellow Crane Tower, one of the Four Great Towers of China, was constructed on the Wuchang side of the Yangtze River by order of Sun Quan, leader of the Eastern Wu. The tower become a sacred site of Taoism.Due to tensions between the Eastern Wu and Cao Wei kingdoms, in the autumn of 228, Cao Rui, grandson of Cao Cao and the second emperor of the state of Cao Wei, ordered the general Man Chong to lead troops to Xiakou (\u590f\u53e3; in present-day Wuhan). In 279, Wang Jun and his army conquered strategic locations in Wu territory such as Xiling (in present-day Yichang, Hubei), Xiakou (\u590f\u53e3; present-day Hankou) and Wuchang (\u6b66\u660c; present-day Ezhou, Hubei).\nDuring the Northern and Southern dynasties period, the Wuhan area was part of the successive Southern dynasty states Liu Song (420\u2013479), Southern Qi (479\u2013502), Liang, and Western Liang.\nIn fall 550, Hou Jing sent Ren Yue to attack both Xiao Daxin and Xiao Fan's son Xiao Si (\u856d\u55e3).  Ren killed Xiao Si in battle, and Xiao Daxin, unable to resist, surrendered, allowing Hou to take his domain under control.  Meanwhile, Xiao Guan, who had by now settled at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan), was planning to attack Hou, but this drew Xiao Yi's ire\u2014believing that Xiao Guan was intending to contend for the throne\u2014and he sent Wang to attack Xiao Guan. In summer 567, Chen Xu commissioned Wu Mingche as the governor of Xiang Province and had him command a major part of the troops against Hua, along with Chunyu Liang (\u6df3\u4e8e\u91cf). The opposing sides met at Zhuankou (\u6c8c\u53e3, in modern Wuhan).\nThe city has long been renowned as a center for the arts (especially poetry) and for intellectual studies. Cui Hao, a celebrated poet of the Tang dynasty, visited the Yellow Crane Tower in the early 8th century; his poem made it the most celebrated building in southern China.In spring 877, Wang Xianzhi captured E Prefecture (\u9102\u5dde, in modern Wuhan).  He then returned north, joining forces with Huang again, and they surrounded Song Wei at Song Prefecture (\u5b8b\u5dde, in modern Shangqiu, Henan).  In winter 877, Huang Chao pillaged Qi and Huang (\u9ec3\u5dde, in modern Wuhan) Prefectures.\nBefore Kublai Khan arrived in 1259, word reached him that M\u00f6ngke had died. Kublai decided to keep the death of his brother secret and continued the attack on the Wuhan area, near the Yangtze. The present-day Wuying Pagoda was constructed at the end of the Song Dynasty between attacks by the Mongolian forces.  Under the Mongol rulers (Yuan dynasty) (after 1301), the Wuchang prefecture, headquartered in the town, became the capital of Hubei province. Hankou, from the Ming to late Qing, was under the administration of the local government in Hanyang, although it was already one of the four major national markets (zh:\u56db\u5927\u540d\u9547) of the Ming dynasty.\nHanyang's Guiyuan Temple was completed in the 15th year of Shunzhi (1658).By the dawn of the 18th century, Hankou had become one of China's top four most important towns of trade. In the late 19th century, railroads were extended on a north\u2013south axis through the city, making Wuhan an important transshipment point between rail and river traffic. Also during this period foreign powers extracted mercantile concessions, with the riverfront of Hankou being divided up into foreign-controlled merchant districts. These districts contained trading firm offices, warehouses, and docking facilities. The French had a concession in Hankou. During the Taiping Rebellion, the Wuhan area was controlled for many years by rebel forces and the Yellow Crane Tower, Xingfu Temple, Zhuodaoquan Temple and other buildings were repurposed or damaged. During the Second Opium War (known in the West as the Arrow War, 1856\u20131860), the government of the Qing dynasty was defeated by the western powers and signed the Treaties of Tianjin and the Convention of Peking, which stipulated eleven cities or regions (including Hankou) as trading ports. In December 1858, James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, High Commissioner to China, led four warships up the Yangtze River in Wuhan to collect the information needed for opening the trading port in Wuhan.\nIn the spring of 1861, Counselor Harry Parkes and Admiral Herbert were sent to Wuhan to open a trading port. On the basis of the Convention of Peking, Harry Parkes concluded the Hankou Lend-Lease Treaty with Guan Wen, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei. It brought an area of 30.53 square kilometers (11.79 sq mi) along the Yangtze River (from latter-day Jianghan Road to Hezuo Road) to become a British Concession and permitted Britain to set up its consulate in the concession.\n\nIn 1889, Zhang Zhidong was transferred from Viceroy of Liangguang (Guangdong and Guangxi provinces) to Viceroy of Huguang (Hunan and Hubei provinces). He governed the province for 18 years, until 1907. During this period, he elucidated the theory of \"Chinese learning as the basis, Western learning for application,\" known as the ti-yong ideal. He set up many heavy industries, founded Hanyang Steel Plant, Daye Iron Mine, Pingxiang Coal Mine and Hubei Arsenal and set up local textile industries, boosting the flourishing modern industry in Wuhan. Meanwhile, he initiated education reform, opened dozens of modern educational organizations successively, such as Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) Academy of Classical Learning, Civil General Institute, Military General Institute, Foreign Languages Institute and Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) General Normal School, and selected a great many students for study overseas, which well promoted the development of China's modern education. Furthermore, he trained a modern military and organized a modern army including a zhen and a xie (both zhen and xie are military units in the Qing dynasty) in Hubei.\nOriginally known as the Hubei Arsenal, the Hanyang Arsenal was founded in 1891 by Qing official Zhang Zhidong, who diverted funds from the Nanyang Fleet in Guangdong to build the arsenal. It cost about 250,000 pounds sterling and was built in 4 years. On 23 April 1894, construction was completed and the arsenal, occupying some 40 acres (160,000 m2), could start production of small-caliber cannons. It built magazine-fed rifles, Gruson quick fire guns, and cartridges.\n\n\n==== Wuchang Uprising ====\n\nBy 1900, according to Collier's magazine, Hankau, the Yangtze River boom town, was \"the St. Louis and Chicago of China.\" On October 10, 1911, Sun Yat-sen's followers launched the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the collapse of the Qing dynasty, as well as the establishment of the Chinese Republic.The Wuchang Uprising of October 1911, which overthrew the Qing dynasty, originated in Wuhan. Before the uprising, anti-Qing secret societies were active in Wuhan. In September 1911, the outbreak of the protests in Sichuan forced the Qing authorities to send part of the New Army garrisoned in Wuhan to suppress the rebellion. On September 14 the Literary Society (\u6587\u5b78\u793e) and the Progressive Association (\u5171\u9032\u6703), two local revolutionary organizations in Hubei, set up joint headquarters in Wuchang and planned for an uprising. On the morning of October 9, a bomb at the office of the political arrangement exploded prematurely and alerted local authorities. The proclamation for the uprising, beadroll and the revolutionaries\u2019 official seal fell into the hands of Rui Cheng, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei, who demolished the uprising headquarters the same day and set out to arrest the revolutionaries listed in the beadroll. This forced the revolutionaries to launch the uprising earlier than planned.On the night of October 10, the revolutionaries fired shots to signal the uprising at the engineering barracks of Hubei New Army. They then led the New Army of all barracks to join the revolution. Under the guidance of Wu Zhaolin, Cai Jimin and others, this revolutionary army seized the official residence of the governor and government offices. Rui Cheng fled in panic into the Chuyu ship. Zhang Biao, the commander of the Qing army, also fled the city. On the morning of the 11th, the revolutionary army took the whole city of Wuchang, but leaders such as Jiang Yiwu and Sun Wu disappeared. Thus the leaderless revolutionary army recommended Li Yuanhong, the assistant governor of the Qing army, as the commander-in-chief. Li founded the Hubei Military Government, proclaimed the abolition of the Qing rule in Hubei, the founding of the Republic of China and published an open telegram calling for other provinces to join the revolution.As the revolution spread to other parts of the country, the Qing government concentrated loyalist military forces to suppress the uprising in Wuhan. From October 17 to December 1, the revolutionary army and local volunteers defended the city in the Battle of Yangxia against better armed and more numerous Qing forces commanded by Yuan Shikai. Huang Xing would arrive in Wuhan in early November to take command of the revolutionary army. After fierce fighting and heavy casualties, Qing forces seized Hankou and Hanyang. But Yuan agreed to halt the advance on Wuchang and participated in peace talks, which would eventually lead to the return of Sun Yat-sen from exile, founding of the Republic of China on January 1, 1912. Through the Wuchang Uprising, Wuhan is known as the birthplace of the Xinhai Revolution, named after the Xinhai year on the Chinese calendar. The city has several museums and memorials to the revolution and the thousands of martyrs who died defending the revolution.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\n\nWith the northern extension of the Northern Expedition, the center of the Great Revolution shifted from the Pearl River basin to the Yangtze River basin. On November 26, the Kuomintang Central Political Committee decided to move the capital from Guangzhou to Wuhan. In mid-December, most of the KMT central executive commissioners and national government commissioners arrived in Wuhan, set up the temporary joint conference of central executive commissioners and National Government commissioners, performed the top functions of central party headquarters and National Government, declared they would work in Wuhan on January 1, 1927, and decided to combine the towns of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang into Wuhan City, called \"Capital District\". The new national government, later known as \"Wuhan nationalist government\", was based in the Nanyang Building in Hankou, while the central party headquarters and other organizations chose their locations in Hankou or Wuchang.In March 1927, Mao Zedong appeared at the Third Plenum of the KMT Central Executive Committee in Wuhan, which sought to strip General Chiang of his power by appointing Wang Jingwei leader. The first phase of the Northern Expedition was interrupted by the political split in the Kuomintang following the formation of the Nanjing faction in April 1927 against the existing faction in Wuhan. Members of the Chinese Communist Party, who had survived the April 12 massacre, met at Wuhan and reelected Chen Duxiu (Ch'en Tu-hsiu) as the Party's Secretary General. The split was partially motivated by the purge of the Communists within the party, which marked the end of the First United Front, and Chiang Kai-shek briefly stepped down as the commander of the National Revolutionary Army.In June 1927, Stalin sent a telegram to the Communists in Wuhan, calling for the mobilization of an army of workers and peasants. This alarmed Wang Jingwei, who decided to break with the Communists and come to terms with Chiang Kai-shek. The Wuhan coup was a political shift made on July 15, 1927, by Wang Jingwei towards Chiang Kai-shek, and his Shanghai-based rival in the Kuomintang. The Wuhan Nationalist Government was established in Wuhan on February 21, 1927, and ended by August 19, 1927. After the end of the Northern Expedition, Hankou was elevated to a centrally-controlled municipality.\n\nIn the 1931 China floods, one of the deadliest flood disasters in world history, Wuhan was a refuge for flood victims from outlying areas, who had been arriving since the late spring. But when the city itself was inundated in the early summer, and after a catastrophic dike failure just before 6:00 AM on July 27, an estimated 782,189 urban citizens and rural refugees were left homeless. The flood covered an area of 32 square miles and the city was flooded under many feet of water for close to three months. Large numbers gathered on flood islands throughout the city, with 30,000 sheltering on a railway embankment in central Hankou. With little food and a complete breakdown in sanitation, thousands soon began to succumb to diseases. Jin Shilong, Senior Engineer at the Hubei Flood Prevention Agency, described the flooding:There was no warning, only a sudden great wall of water. Most of Wuhan's buildings in those days were only one story high, and for many people there was no escape- they died by the tens of thousands. ... I was just coming off duty at the company's main office, a fairly new three-story building near the center of town ... When I heard the terrible noise and saw the wall of water coming, I raced to the top story of the building. ... I was in one of the tallest and strongest buildings left standing. At that time no one knew whether the water would subside or rise even higher.The high-water mark was reached on 19 August at Hankou, with the water level exceeding 16 m (53 ft) above normal. In 1936, when natural disaster struck Central China with widespread flooding affecting Hebei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Wuhan and Chongqing caused by the Yangtze and Huai Rivers bursting their banks, Ong Seok Kim, as Chairman of the Sitiawan Fundraising and Disaster Relief Committee, raised money and materials in support of the victims.\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War and following the fall of Nanking in December 1937, Wuhan had become the provisional capital of China's Kuomintang government, and became another focal point of pitched air battles beginning in early 1938 between modern monoplane bomber and fighter aircraft of the Imperial Japanese forces and the Chinese Air Force, which included support from the Soviet Volunteer Group in both planes and personnel, as U.S. support in war materials waned. As the battle raged on through 1938, Wuhan and the surrounding region had become the site of the Battle of Wuhan. After being taken by the Japanese in late 1938, Wuhan became a major Japanese logistics center for operations in southern China.\n\nIn early October 1938, Japanese troops moved east and north in the outskirts of Wuhan. As a result, numerous companies and enterprises and large numbers of people had to withdraw from Wuhan to the west of Hubei and Sichuan. The KMT navy undertook the responsibility of defending the Yangtze River on patrol and covering the withdrawal. On October 24, while overseeing the waters of the Yangtze River near the town of Jinkou (Jiangxia District in Wuhan) in Wuchang, the KMT gunboat Zhongshan came up against six Japanese aircraft. Though two were eventually shot down, the Zhongshan sank with 25 casualties. Raised from the bottom of the Yangtze River in 1997, and restored at a local shipyard, the Zhongshan has been moved to a purpose-built museum in Wuhan's suburban Jiangxia District, which opened on September 26, 2011.As a key center on the Yangtze, Wuhan was an important base for Japanese operations in China. On 18 December 1944, Wuhan was bombed by 77 American bombers that set off a firestorm that destroyed much of the city. For the next three days, Wuhan was bombed by the Americans, destroying all of the docks and warehouses of Wuhan, as well as the Japanese air bases in the city. The air raids killed thousands of Chinese civilians which American bombers did not know. \"According to casualty statistics compiled by Hankou city in 1946, more than 20,000 were killed or injured in the December bombings of 1944.\"Wuhan returned to Chinese control in September 1945. Administratively, Wuchang and Hanyang were initially combined into a new City of Wuchang, but in October 1946 were separated into the City of Wuchang (including Wuchang only) and the County of Hanyang. Hankou became a centrally controlled municipality in August 1947. Militarily, the Wuhan Forward Headquarters was established in Wuhan, headed by Bai Chongxi.\n\nDuring the later stages of the Chinese Civil War, Bai sought to broker peace, proposing that the Communist Party could rule northern China while the Nationalist government retained southern China. This was rejected, and on 15 May 1949 Bai and the Wuhan garrison retreated from the city. People's Liberation Army troops entered Wuhan on the afternoon of Monday, May 16, 1949.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n\nThe Changjiang Water Resources Commission was reestablished in February 1950 with its headquarters in Wuhan. From June to September 1954, the Yangtze River Floods were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to an unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. In 1969, a large stone monument was erected in the riverside park in Hankou honoring the heroic deeds in fighting the 1954 Yangtze River floods.\nBefore construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, Hunslet Engine Company built two extra heavy 0-8-0 locomotives for loading the train ferries for crossing the Yangtze River in Wuhan.\nThe project of building the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also known as the First Yangtze River Bridge, was regarded as one of the key projects during the first five-year plan. On October 25, 1955, construction began on the bridge proper. The same day in 1957, the whole project was completed and an opening-to-traffic ceremony was held on October 15. The First Yangtze River Bridge united the Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway with the Guangdong\u2013Hankou Railway into the Beijing\u2013Guangzhou Railway, making Wuhan a 'thoroughfare to nine provinces' (\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862) in name and in fact.\nAfter Chengdu Conference, Mao went to Chongqing and Wuhan in April to inspect the countryside and factories. In Wuhan, he called all the leaders of provinces and municipalities who had not attended Chengdu Conference to report their work. Tian Jiaying, the secretary of Mao, said that Wuhan Conference was a supplement to Chengdu Conference.In July 1967, civil strife struck the city in the Wuhan Incident (\"July 20th Incident\"), an armed conflict between two hostile groups who were fighting for control over the city at the height of the Cultural Revolution.In 1981, the Wuhan City Government commenced reconstruction of the Yellow Crane Tower at a new location, about 1 km (0.62 mi) from the original site, and it was completed in 1985. In 1957, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was built with one trestle of the bridge on the site of the tower, which had been last destroyed in 1884.During the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, students in Wuhan blocked the Yangtze River Railway bridge and another 4,000 gathered at the railway station. About one thousand students staged a railroad 'sit-in'. Rail traffic on the Beijing-Guangzhou and Wuhan-Dalian lines was interrupted. The students also urged employees of major state-owned enterprises to go on strike. The situation was so tense that residents reportedly began a bank run and resorted to panic-buying.\n\nIn the wake of the United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade on May 7, 1999, protests broke out throughout China, including in Wuhan.On June 22, 2000, a Wuhan Airlines flight from Enshi to Wuhan was forced to circle for 30 minutes due to thunderstorms. The aircraft eventually crashed on the banks of Han River in Hanyang District, all on-board perished (there were varying accounts of number of crews and passengers). In addition, the crash also killed 7 people on the ground.Chinese protesters organized boycotts of the French-owned retail chain Carrefour in major Chinese cities including Kunming, Hefei and Wuhan, accusing the French nation of pro-secessionist conspiracy and anti-Chinese racism. The BBC reported that hundreds of people demonstrated in Beijing, Wuhan, Hefei, Kunming and Qingdao. On May 19, 2011, Fang Binxing, the Principal of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (also known as \"Father of China's Great Fire Wall\") was hit on the chest by a shoe thrown at him by a Huazhong University of Science and Technology student who calls herself \"hanjunyi\" (\u5bd2\u541b\u4f9d, or \u5c0f\u6e56\u5317) while Fang was giving a lecture at Wuhan University.The city has been subject to devastating floods, which are now supposed to be controlled by the ambitious Three Gorges Dam, a project which was completed in 2008. The 2008 Chinese winter storms damaged water supply equipment in Wuhan: up to 100,000 people were out of running water when several water pipes burst, cutting the supply to local households. The 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat wave hit Wuhan on July 3.\nIn the 2010 China floods, the Han River at Wuhan experienced its worst flooding in twenty years, as officials continued sandbagging efforts along the Han and Yangtze Rivers in the city and checked reservoirs. In the 2011 China floods, Wuhan was flooded, with parts of the city losing power. In the 2016 China floods, Wuhan saw 570 mm (22 in) of rainfall during the first week of July, surpassing the record that fell on the city in 1991. A red alert for heavy rainfall was issued on 2 July, the same day that eight people died after a 15-meter (49 ft) section of a 2 m (6.6 ft) tall wall collapsed on top of them. The city's subway system, the Wuhan Metro was partially submerged as was the main railway station. At least 14 city residents were killed, one was missing, and more than 80,000 were relocated.In early July 2019, there were protests against plans for a new incinerator in Xinzhou District.The 2019 Military World Games were hosted in Wuhan in October.\nIn December 2019, an epidemic of a new coronavirus disease began in Wuhan. The disease, which became known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), spread and developed into the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Wuhan and other Hubei cities were placed under lockdown for nearly three months to contain the disease. On April 8, 2020, the Wuhan lockdown officially came to an end after no new domestic cases were reported in Hubei province.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Overview ===\n\nWuhan is in east-central Hubei, at latitude 29\u00b0 58'\u201331\u00b0 22' N and longitude 113\u00b0 41'\u2013115\u00b0 05' E. Wuhan sits at the confluence of the Han River flowing into the Yangtze River at the East of the Jianghan Plain along the Yangtze's middle reaches.\nThe metropolitan area comprises three parts\u2014Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang\u2014commonly called the \"Three Towns of Wuhan\" (hence the name \"Wuhan\", combining \"Wu\" from the first city and \"Han\" from the other two). The consolidation of these cities occurred in 1927 and Wuhan was thereby established. The three former cities face each other across the rivers and are linked by bridges, including one of the first modern bridges in China, known as the \"First Bridge\".\n\nWuchang lies South East of the Yangtze River that separates it from both Hankou and Hanyang.\nHankou sits North of the Yangtze River separating it from Wuchang. Hankou is North of the Han River separating it from Hanyang.\nHanyang lies West of the Yangtze separating it from Wuchang. Hanyang is south of the Han river separating it from Hankou.\nIt is simple in terrain \u2014 low and flat in the middle and hilly in the south, with the Yangtze and Han rivers winding through the city. The She River enters the Yangtze in Huangpi District. Wuhan occupies a land area of 8,494.41 square kilometers (3,279.71 sq mi), most of which is alluvial plain and decorated with hills and a great number of lakes and ponds. Water makes up one quarter of Wuhan's urban territory, which is the highest percentage among  major cities in China. Wuhan has nearly 200 lakes, including the East Lake of 33 km2, and Tangxun Lake, which are the largest lakes entirely within a city in China.Other well-known lakes include South Lake and Sand Lake. Liangzi Lake, the largest lake by surface area in Hubei province, is located in the southeast of Jiangxia District. At 709 m (2,326 ft) above sea level, the highest point in Wuhan is the main peak of Yunwu Mountain (\u4e91\u96fe\u5c71) in northwestern Huangpi District. There are also several mountains within the city limits of Wuhan including Mount Luojia (\u73de\u73c8\u5c71) in Wuchang District as well as Mount Hong (\u6d2a\u5c71) and Mount Yujia (\u55bb\u5bb6\u5c71/\u745c\u73c8\u5c71) in Hongshan District.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nWuhan's climate is humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) with abundant rainfall in summer and four distinctive seasons. Wuhan is known for its humid summers, when dewpoints can often reach 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) or more. Historically, along with Chongqing and Nanjing, Wuhan is referred to as one of the \"Three Furnacelike Cities\" along the Yangtze River for their hot summers. However, the climate data of recent years suggests that Wuhan is no longer among the top tier of \"The hottest cities in summer\" list, the New Four Furnacelike Cities are Chongqing, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, and Nanchang. Spring and autumn are generally mild, while winter is cool with quite low rainfall and occasional snow. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from 4.0 \u00b0C (39.2 \u00b0F) in January to 29.1 \u00b0C (84.4 \u00b0F) in July.

Wuhan Railway Hub is considered one of the four key railway hubs of China. The city of Wuhan is served by three major railway stations: the Hankou Railway Station in Hankou, the Wuchang Railway Station in Wuchang, and the Wuhan Railway Station, located in a newly developed area east of the East Lake (Hongshan District). As the stations are many miles apart, it is important for passengers to be aware of the particular station(s) used by a particular train.\nThe (original) Hankou Station was the terminus for the Jinghan Railway from Beijing, while the Wuchang Station was the terminus for the Yuehan Railway to Guangzhou. Since the construction of the First Yangtze Bridge and the linking of the two lines into the Jingguang Railway, both Hankou and Wuchang stations have been served by trains going to all directions, which contrasts with the situation in such cities as New York or Moscow, where different stations serve different directions.\nWith the opening of the Hefei-Wuhan high-speed railway on April 1, 2009, Wuhan became served by high-speed trains with Hefei, Nanjing, and Shanghai; several trains a day now connect the city with Shanghai, getting there in under 6 hours. As of early 2010, most of these express trains leave from the Hankou Railway Station.\n\nIn 2006, construction began on the new Wuhan Railway Station with 11 platforms, located on the northeastern outskirts of the city. In December 2009, the station was opened, as China unveiled its second high-speed train with scheduled runs from Guangzhou to Wuhan. Billed as the fastest train in the world, it can reach a speed of 394 km/h (244.82 mph). The travel time between the two cities has been reduced from ten and a half hours to just three. The rail service has been extended north to Beijing.As of 2011, the new Wuhan Railway Station is primarily used by the Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed trains, while most regular trains to other destinations continue to use the Hankou and Wuchang stations.\n\nConstruction work is carried out on several lines of the new Wuhan Metropolitan Area Intercity Railway, which will eventually connect Wuhan's three main rail terminals with several stations throughout the city's outer areas and farther suburbs, as well as with the nearby cities of Xianning, Huangshi, Huanggang, and Xiaogan. The first line of the system, the one to Xianning, opened for passenger operations at the end of 2013. The line to Xiaogen opened on 1 December 2016 and it was extended with the opening of the Wuhan\u2013Shiyan high-speed railway to Shiyan on 29 November 2019.The main freight railway station and classification yard of the Wuhan metropolitan area is the extensive Wuhan North railway station, with 112 tracks and over 650 switches. It is located in Hengdian Subdistrict of Huangpi District, located 20 km (12 mi) north of the Wuhan Station and 23 km (14 mi) from Hankou Station.\n\n\n=== Wuhan Metro ===\n\nWuhan Metro is a rapid transit system serving the city of Wuhan.

Line 2 opened on 28 December 2012 and is the first underground metro line crossing the Yangtze River. With 1.22 billion annual passengers in 2019, Wuhan Metro is the sixth-busiest rapid transit system in mainland China. There are a number of lines or sections under construction. The government of Wuhan City promised the citizens that at least two lines or sections open every year. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire network was out of service from 23 January to 27 March 2020.\n\n\n=== Trams ===\n\nTrams were brought to the streets of Wuhan on July 28, 2017 with the first line (Auto-city T1 Line) opened that day.

In 2012 the Wuhan and Hangzhou Public Bicycle programs in China are the largest in the world, with around 90,000 and 60,000 bicycles respectively. China has seen a rise in private \"dockless\" bike shares with fleets that dwarf systems in size outside China. Initially, a number of traditional (third generation) docked public bike systems operated by local municipal governments opened across China, with the largest ones being in Wuhan and Hangzhou.  The first was introduced in Beijing in 2007.  However, third generation bike sharing is not considered successful for the majority cities in China.  Bike sharing in Beijing virtually stopped and it also has encountered difficulties in Shanghai and Wuhan.\n\n\n== Destinations ==\n\nThe Yellow Crane Tower (Huanghelou) is presumed to have been first built in approximately 220 AD.

Including its approaches, it is 5,511 feet (1,680 m) long, and it accommodates both a double-track railway on a lower deck and a four-lane roadway above. It was built with the assistance of advisers from the Soviet Union.\nThe Second Bridge, a cable-stayed bridge built of prestressed concrete, has a central span of 400 meters (1,300 feet); it is 4,678 meters (15,348 feet) in length (including 1,877 meters (6,158 feet) of the main bridge) and 26.5 to 33.5 meters (86.9 to 109.9 feet) in width. Its main bridgeheads are 90 meters (300 feet) high each, pulling 392 thick slanting cables together in the shape of double fans so that the central span of the bridge is well poised on the piers and the bridge's stability and vibration resistance are ensured. With six lanes on the deck, the bridge is designed to handle the daily passage of 50,000 motor vehicles. The bridge was completed in 1995.\n\nThe Third Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also called Baishazhou Bridge, was completed in September 2000. Located 8.6 kilometers (5.3 miles) southwest of the First Bridge, construction of Baishazhou Bridge started in 1997. With an investment of over 1.4 billion yuan (about US$170,000,000), the bridge, which is 3,586 meters (11,765 feet) long and 26.5 meters (86.9 feet) wide, has six lanes and has a capacity of 50,000 vehicles a day. The bridge is expected to serve as a major passage for the future Wuhan Ring Road, greatly easing the city's traffic and aiding local economic development.\nThe Yangluo Bridge carries Wuhan's Ring Road across the Yangtze in the city's eastern suburbs (connecting the Hongshan District with the Xinzhou District). It was opened on December 26, 2007.\nThe Wuhan Tianxingzhou Yangtze River Bridge crosses the Yangtze in the northeastern part of the city, downstream of the Second bridge. It is named after Tianxing Island (Tianxingzhou), above which it crosses the river. Built at a cost of 11 billion yuan, the 4,657-meter cable suspension bridge was opened on December 26, 2009, in time for the opening of the Wuhan Railway Station. It is a combined road and rail bridge, and carries the Wuhan\u2013Guangzhou High-Speed Railway across the river.\n\n\n=== Skyscrapers ===\n\nThe Yellow Crane Tower, historically one of the tallest buildings in Wuhan, is considered one of the Four Great Towers of China and was destroyed twelve times, both by warfare and by fire. The tower is classified as an AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration. At 438 meters (1,437 ft) in height, the Wuhan Center skyscraper, the tallest structure in Wuhan and in Central China, is the eighth tallest structure in China. The Minsheng Bank Building, the second tallest structure in Wuhan, was the tallest building in Wuhan when it was completed in 2007. It retained the title until Wuhan Center surpassed it in 2014. Wuhan World Trade Tower is a 273-meter (896 foot) tall skyscraper located in Wuhan. It became the tallest building in Wuhan after its completion in 1998. However, it was surpassed by the Minsheng Bank Building in 2007.\nThe Wuhan Greenland Center is a planned 636-meter (2,087 ft), 126-floor mixed-use skyscraper currently under construction and scheduled for completion in 2019. If completed as planned, it will be among the world's tallest structures, and one of the world's tallest buildings by occupiable floor height. The Phoenix Towers are proposed supertall skyscrapers planned for construction in Wuhan. At 1 kilometer (3,300 ft) high, the towers would also be among the tallest structures in the world when completed.\n\n\n== Notable Wuhanese ==\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nLi Yuanhong \u2013 former President of the Republic of China (1916\u201317, 1922\u201323).\nWu Yi \u2013 former Vice-Premier and Minister of Health of the People's Republic of China\n\n\n=== Business ===\nWei Brian - Chinese entrepreneur\n\n\n=== Science ===\nChang-Lin Tien \u2013 seventh Chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley (1990\u20131997) and a major founder of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering (NAE).

        "wiki": "Wuhan (simplified Chinese: \u6b66\u6c49; traditional Chinese: \u6b66\u6f22, [\u00f9.x\u00e2n] (listen)) is the capital city of Hubei Province in the People's Republic of China. It is the largest city in Hubei and the most populous city in Central China, with a population of over 11 million, the ninth most populous Chinese city and one of the nine National Central Cities of China.The name \"Wuhan\" came from the city's historical origin from the conglomeration of Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang, which are collectively known as the \"Three Towns of Wuhan\" (\u6b66\u6c49\u4e09\u9547).  It lies in the eastern Jianghan Plain, at the confluence of the Yangtze river and its largest tributary, the Han River and is known as \"Nine Provinces' Thoroughfare\" (\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862).Wuhan is considered by some to be one of the potential sites of the pivotal Battle of the Red Cliffs, which stopped warlord Cao Cao's incursion into southern China at the end of the Eastern Han dynasty. Other historical events taking place in Wuhan include the Wuchang Uprising of 1911, which led to the downfall of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China. Wuhan was briefly the capital of China in 1927 under the left wing of the Kuomintang (KMT) government led by Wang Jingwei. The city later served as the wartime capital of China for ten months in 1937 during the Second Sino-Japanese War. A novel coronavirus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic was first identified in Wuhan in December 2019.Wuhan is considered the political, economic, financial, commercial, cultural and educational center of Central China. It is a major transportation hub, with dozens of railways, roads and expressways passing through the city and connecting to other major cities. Because of its key role in domestic transportation, Wuhan is sometimes referred to as \"the Chicago of China\" by foreign sources. The \"Golden Waterway\" of the Yangtze River and the Han River traverse the urban area and divide Wuhan into the three districts of Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge crosses the Yangtze in the city. The Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest power station in terms of installed capacity, is located nearby. Historically, Wuhan has suffered risks of flooding, prompting the government to alleviate the situation by introducing ecologically friendly absorption mechanisms.While Wuhan has been a traditional manufacturing hub for decades, it is also one of the areas promoting modern industrial changes in China. Wuhan consists of three national development zones, four scientific and technological development parks, over 350 research institutes, 1,656 high tech enterprises, numerous enterprise incubators and investments from 230 Fortune Global 500 firms. It produced GDP of US$22.4 billion in 2018. The Dongfeng Motor Corporation, an automobile manufacturer, is headquartered in Wuhan. The city is home to multiple notable institutes of higher education, including Wuhan University and the Huazhong University of Science and Technology. In 2017, Wuhan was designated as a Creative City by UNESCO, in the field of design. Wuhan is classified as a Beta world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Wuhan\" is a portmanteau of the two major cities on the northern and southern banks of the Yangtze River that make up the Wuhan metropolis: \"Wu\" refers to the city of Wuchang (Chinese: \u6b66\u660c), which lies on the southern bank of the Yangtze, while \"Han\" refers to the city of Hankou (Chinese: \u6c49\u53e3), which lies on the northern bank of the Yangtze.\nIn 1926, the Northern Expedition reached the Wuhan area and it was decided to merge Hankou, Wuchang and Hanyang into one city in order to make a new capital for Nationalist China. On January 1, 1927, the resulting city was proclaimed as '\u6b66\u6f22' (the traditional Chinese characters for 'Wuhan'), which was later simplified as '\u6b66\u6c49' (also 'Wuhan').\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nThe Wuhan area has been settled for 3,500 years. Panlongcheng, an archaeological site primarily associated with the Erligang culture (c. 1510 \u2013 c. 1460 BC) (being sparsely populated during the earlier Erlitou period), is located in modern-day Huangpi District.\nDuring the Western Zhou the State of E, which gives its name to the single character abbreviation for Hubei province, controlled the present-day Wuchang area south of the Yangtze River. After the conquest of the E state in 863 BC, the present-day Wuhan area was controlled by the State of Chu for the rest of the Western Zhou and Eastern Zhou periods.  Chu was in turn conquered by Qin in 223 BCE.\n\n\n=== Imperial China ===\n\nDuring the Han dynasty, Hanyang became a fairly busy port. The Battle of Xiakou in AD 203 and Battle of Jiangxia five years later were fought over control of Jiangxia Commandery (present-day Xinzhou District in northeast Wuhan). In the winter of 208/9, one of the most famous battles in Chinese history and a central event in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms\u2014the Battle of Red Cliffs\u2014took place near the Yangtze River, with the cliffs near Wuhan identified as one of the potential locations. Around that time, walls were built to protect Hanyang (AD 206) and Wuchang (AD 223). The latter event marks the foundation of Wuhan. In AD 223, the Yellow Crane Tower, one of the Four Great Towers of China, was constructed on the Wuchang side of the Yangtze River by order of Sun Quan, leader of the Eastern Wu. The tower become a sacred site of Taoism.Due to tensions between the Eastern Wu and Cao Wei kingdoms, in the autumn of 228, Cao Rui, grandson of Cao Cao and the second emperor of the state of Cao Wei, ordered the general Man Chong to lead troops to Xiakou (\u590f\u53e3; in present-day Wuhan). In 279, Wang Jun and his army conquered strategic locations in Wu territory such as Xiling (in present-day Yichang, Hubei), Xiakou (\u590f\u53e3; present-day Hankou) and Wuchang (\u6b66\u660c; present-day Ezhou, Hubei).\nDuring the Northern and Southern dynasties period, the Wuhan area was part of the successive Southern dynasty states Liu Song (420\u2013479), Southern Qi (479\u2013502), Liang, and Western Liang.\nIn fall 550, Hou Jing sent Ren Yue to attack both Xiao Daxin and Xiao Fan's son Xiao Si (\u856d\u55e3).  Ren killed Xiao Si in battle, and Xiao Daxin, unable to resist, surrendered, allowing Hou to take his domain under control.  Meanwhile, Xiao Guan, who had by now settled at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan), was planning to attack Hou, but this drew Xiao Yi's ire\u2014believing that Xiao Guan was intending to contend for the throne\u2014and he sent Wang to attack Xiao Guan. In summer 567, Chen Xu commissioned Wu Mingche as the governor of Xiang Province and had him command a major part of the troops against Hua, along with Chunyu Liang (\u6df3\u4e8e\u91cf). The opposing sides met at Zhuankou (\u6c8c\u53e3, in modern Wuhan).\nThe city has long been renowned as a center for the arts (especially poetry) and for intellectual studies. Cui Hao, a celebrated poet of the Tang dynasty, visited the Yellow Crane Tower in the early 8th century; his poem made it the most celebrated building in southern China.In spring 877, Wang Xianzhi captured E Prefecture (\u9102\u5dde, in modern Wuhan).  He then returned north, joining forces with Huang again, and they surrounded Song Wei at Song Prefecture (\u5b8b\u5dde, in modern Shangqiu, Henan).  In winter 877, Huang Chao pillaged Qi and Huang (\u9ec3\u5dde, in modern Wuhan) Prefectures.\nBefore Kublai Khan arrived in 1259, word reached him that M\u00f6ngke had died. Kublai decided to keep the death of his brother secret and continued the attack on the Wuhan area, near the Yangtze. The present-day Wuying Pagoda was constructed at the end of the Song Dynasty between attacks by the Mongolian forces.  Under the Mongol rulers (Yuan dynasty) (after 1301), the Wuchang prefecture, headquartered in the town, became the capital of Hubei province. Hankou, from the Ming to late Qing, was under the administration of the local government in Hanyang, although it was already one of the four major national markets (zh:\u56db\u5927\u540d\u9547) of the Ming dynasty.\nHanyang's Guiyuan Temple was completed in the 15th year of Shunzhi (1658).By the dawn of the 18th century, Hankou had become one of China's top four most important towns of trade. In the late 19th century, railroads were extended on a north\u2013south axis through the city, making Wuhan an important transshipment point between rail and river traffic. Also during this period foreign powers extracted mercantile concessions, with the riverfront of Hankou being divided up into foreign-controlled merchant districts. These districts contained trading firm offices, warehouses, and docking facilities. The French had a concession in Hankou. During the Taiping Rebellion, the Wuhan area was controlled for many years by rebel forces and the Yellow Crane Tower, Xingfu Temple, Zhuodaoquan Temple and other buildings were repurposed or damaged. During the Second Opium War (known in the West as the Arrow War, 1856\u20131860), the government of the Qing dynasty was defeated by the western powers and signed the Treaties of Tianjin and the Convention of Peking, which stipulated eleven cities or regions (including Hankou) as trading ports. In December 1858, James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, High Commissioner to China, led four warships up the Yangtze River in Wuhan to collect the information needed for opening the trading port in Wuhan.\nIn the spring of 1861, Counselor Harry Parkes and Admiral Herbert were sent to Wuhan to open a trading port. On the basis of the Convention of Peking, Harry Parkes concluded the Hankou Lend-Lease Treaty with Guan Wen, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei. It brought an area of 30.53 square kilometers (11.79 sq mi) along the Yangtze River (from latter-day Jianghan Road to Hezuo Road) to become a British Concession and permitted Britain to set up its consulate in the concession.\n\nIn 1889, Zhang Zhidong was transferred from Viceroy of Liangguang (Guangdong and Guangxi provinces) to Viceroy of Huguang (Hunan and Hubei provinces). He governed the province for 18 years, until 1907. During this period, he elucidated the theory of \"Chinese learning as the basis, Western learning for application,\" known as the ti-yong ideal. He set up many heavy industries, founded Hanyang Steel Plant, Daye Iron Mine, Pingxiang Coal Mine and Hubei Arsenal and set up local textile industries, boosting the flourishing modern industry in Wuhan. Meanwhile, he initiated education reform, opened dozens of modern educational organizations successively, such as Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) Academy of Classical Learning, Civil General Institute, Military General Institute, Foreign Languages Institute and Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) General Normal School, and selected a great many students for study overseas, which well promoted the development of China's modern education. Furthermore, he trained a modern military and organized a modern army including a zhen and a xie (both zhen and xie are military units in the Qing dynasty) in Hubei.\nOriginally known as the Hubei Arsenal, the Hanyang Arsenal was founded in 1891 by Qing official Zhang Zhidong, who diverted funds from the Nanyang Fleet in Guangdong to build the arsenal. It cost about 250,000 pounds sterling and was built in 4 years. On 23 April 1894, construction was completed and the arsenal, occupying some 40 acres (160,000 m2), could start production of small-caliber cannons. It built magazine-fed rifles, Gruson quick fire guns, and cartridges.\n\n\n==== Wuchang Uprising ====\n\nBy 1900, according to Collier's magazine, Hankau, the Yangtze River boom town, was \"the St. Louis and Chicago of China.\" On October 10, 1911, Sun Yat-sen's followers launched the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the collapse of the Qing dynasty, as well as the establishment of the Chinese Republic.The Wuchang Uprising of October 1911, which overthrew the Qing dynasty, originated in Wuhan. Before the uprising, anti-Qing secret societies were active in Wuhan. In September 1911, the outbreak of the protests in Sichuan forced the Qing authorities to send part of the New Army garrisoned in Wuhan to suppress the rebellion. On September 14 the Literary Society (\u6587\u5b78\u793e) and the Progressive Association (\u5171\u9032\u6703), two local revolutionary organizations in Hubei, set up joint headquarters in Wuchang and planned for an uprising. On the morning of October 9, a bomb at the office of the political arrangement exploded prematurely and alerted local authorities. The proclamation for the uprising, beadroll and the revolutionaries\u2019 official seal fell into the hands of Rui Cheng, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei, who demolished the uprising headquarters the same day and set out to arrest the revolutionaries listed in the beadroll. This forced the revolutionaries to launch the uprising earlier than planned.On the night of October 10, the revolutionaries fired shots to signal the uprising at the engineering barracks of Hubei New Army. They then led the New Army of all barracks to join the revolution. Under the guidance of Wu Zhaolin, Cai Jimin and others, this revolutionary army seized the official residence of the governor and government offices. Rui Cheng fled in panic into the Chuyu ship. Zhang Biao, the commander of the Qing army, also fled the city. On the morning of the 11th, the revolutionary army took the whole city of Wuchang, but leaders such as Jiang Yiwu and Sun Wu disappeared. Thus the leaderless revolutionary army recommended Li Yuanhong, the assistant governor of the Qing army, as the commander-in-chief. Li founded the Hubei Military Government, proclaimed the abolition of the Qing rule in Hubei, the founding of the Republic of China and published an open telegram calling for other provinces to join the revolution.As the revolution spread to other parts of the country, the Qing government concentrated loyalist military forces to suppress the uprising in Wuhan. From October 17 to December 1, the revolutionary army and local volunteers defended the city in the Battle of Yangxia against better armed and more numerous Qing forces commanded by Yuan Shikai. Huang Xing would arrive in Wuhan in early November to take command of the revolutionary army. After fierce fighting and heavy casualties, Qing forces seized Hankou and Hanyang. But Yuan agreed to halt the advance on Wuchang and participated in peace talks, which would eventually lead to the return of Sun Yat-sen from exile, founding of the Republic of China on January 1, 1912. Through the Wuchang Uprising, Wuhan is known as the birthplace of the Xinhai Revolution, named after the Xinhai year on the Chinese calendar. The city has several museums and memorials to the revolution and the thousands of martyrs who died defending the revolution.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\n\nWith the northern extension of the Northern Expedition, the center of the Great Revolution shifted from the Pearl River basin to the Yangtze River basin. On November 26, the Kuomintang Central Political Committee decided to move the capital from Guangzhou to Wuhan. In mid-December, most of the KMT central executive commissioners and national government commissioners arrived in Wuhan, set up the temporary joint conference of central executive commissioners and National Government commissioners, performed the top functions of central party headquarters and National Government, declared they would work in Wuhan on January 1, 1927, and decided to combine the towns of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang into Wuhan City, called \"Capital District\". The new national government, later known as \"Wuhan nationalist government\", was based in the Nanyang Building in Hankou, while the central party headquarters and other organizations chose their locations in Hankou or Wuchang.In March 1927, Mao Zedong appeared at the Third Plenum of the KMT Central Executive Committee in Wuhan, which sought to strip General Chiang of his power by appointing Wang Jingwei leader. The first phase of the Northern Expedition was interrupted by the political split in the Kuomintang following the formation of the Nanjing faction in April 1927 against the existing faction in Wuhan. Members of the Chinese Communist Party, who had survived the April 12 massacre, met at Wuhan and reelected Chen Duxiu (Ch'en Tu-hsiu) as the Party's Secretary General. The split was partially motivated by the purge of the Communists within the party, which marked the end of the First United Front, and Chiang Kai-shek briefly stepped down as the commander of the National Revolutionary Army.In June 1927, Stalin sent a telegram to the Communists in Wuhan, calling for the mobilization of an army of workers and peasants. This alarmed Wang Jingwei, who decided to break with the Communists and come to terms with Chiang Kai-shek. The Wuhan coup was a political shift made on July 15, 1927, by Wang Jingwei towards Chiang Kai-shek, and his Shanghai-based rival in the Kuomintang. The Wuhan Nationalist Government was established in Wuhan on February 21, 1927, and ended by August 19, 1927. After the end of the Northern Expedition, Hankou was elevated to a centrally-controlled municipality.\n\nIn the 1931 China floods, one of the deadliest flood disasters in world history, Wuhan was a refuge for flood victims from outlying areas, who had been arriving since the late spring. But when the city itself was inundated in the early summer, and after a catastrophic dike failure just before 6:00 AM on July 27, an estimated 782,189 urban citizens and rural refugees were left homeless. The flood covered an area of 32 square miles and the city was flooded under many feet of water for close to three months. Large numbers gathered on flood islands throughout the city, with 30,000 sheltering on a railway embankment in central Hankou. With little food and a complete breakdown in sanitation, thousands soon began to succumb to diseases. Jin Shilong, Senior Engineer at the Hubei Flood Prevention Agency, described the flooding:There was no warning, only a sudden great wall of water. Most of Wuhan's buildings in those days were only one story high, and for many people there was no escape- they died by the tens of thousands. ... I was just coming off duty at the company's main office, a fairly new three-story building near the center of town ... When I heard the terrible noise and saw the wall of water coming, I raced to the top story of the building. ... I was in one of the tallest and strongest buildings left standing. At that time no one knew whether the water would subside or rise even higher.The high-water mark was reached on 19 August at Hankou, with the water level exceeding 16 m (53 ft) above normal. In 1936, when natural disaster struck Central China with widespread flooding affecting Hebei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Wuhan and Chongqing caused by the Yangtze and Huai Rivers bursting their banks, Ong Seok Kim, as Chairman of the Sitiawan Fundraising and Disaster Relief Committee, raised money and materials in support of the victims.\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War and following the fall of Nanking in December 1937, Wuhan had become the provisional capital of China's Kuomintang government, and became another focal point of pitched air battles beginning in early 1938 between modern monoplane bomber and fighter aircraft of the Imperial Japanese forces and the Chinese Air Force, which included support from the Soviet Volunteer Group in both planes and personnel, as U.S. support in war materials waned. As the battle raged on through 1938, Wuhan and the surrounding region had become the site of the Battle of Wuhan. After being taken by the Japanese in late 1938, Wuhan became a major Japanese logistics center for operations in southern China.\n\nIn early October 1938, Japanese troops moved east and north in the outskirts of Wuhan. As a result, numerous companies and enterprises and large numbers of people had to withdraw from Wuhan to the west of Hubei and Sichuan. The KMT navy undertook the responsibility of defending the Yangtze River on patrol and covering the withdrawal. On October 24, while overseeing the waters of the Yangtze River near the town of Jinkou (Jiangxia District in Wuhan) in Wuchang, the KMT gunboat Zhongshan came up against six Japanese aircraft. Though two were eventually shot down, the Zhongshan sank with 25 casualties. Raised from the bottom of the Yangtze River in 1997, and restored at a local shipyard, the Zhongshan has been moved to a purpose-built museum in Wuhan's suburban Jiangxia District, which opened on September 26, 2011.As a key center on the Yangtze, Wuhan was an important base for Japanese operations in China. On 18 December 1944, Wuhan was bombed by 77 American bombers that set off a firestorm that destroyed much of the city. For the next three days, Wuhan was bombed by the Americans, destroying all of the docks and warehouses of Wuhan, as well as the Japanese air bases in the city. The air raids killed thousands of Chinese civilians which American bombers did not know. \"According to casualty statistics compiled by Hankou city in 1946, more than 20,000 were killed or injured in the December bombings of 1944.\"Wuhan returned to Chinese control in September 1945. Administratively, Wuchang and Hanyang were initially combined into a new City of Wuchang, but in October 1946 were separated into the City of Wuchang (including Wuchang only) and the County of Hanyang. Hankou became a centrally controlled municipality in August 1947. Militarily, the Wuhan Forward Headquarters was established in Wuhan, headed by Bai Chongxi.\n\nDuring the later stages of the Chinese Civil War, Bai sought to broker peace, proposing that the Communist Party could rule northern China while the Nationalist government retained southern China. This was rejected, and on 15 May 1949 Bai and the Wuhan garrison retreated from the city. People's Liberation Army troops entered Wuhan on the afternoon of Monday, May 16, 1949.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n\nThe Changjiang Water Resources Commission was reestablished in February 1950 with its headquarters in Wuhan. From June to September 1954, the Yangtze River Floods were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to an unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. In 1969, a large stone monument was erected in the riverside park in Hankou honoring the heroic deeds in fighting the 1954 Yangtze River floods.\nBefore construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, Hunslet Engine Company built two extra heavy 0-8-0 locomotives for loading the train ferries for crossing the Yangtze River in Wuhan.\nThe project of building the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also known as the First Yangtze River Bridge, was regarded as one of the key projects during the first five-year plan. On October 25, 1955, construction began on the bridge proper. The same day in 1957, the whole project was completed and an opening-to-traffic ceremony was held on October 15. The First Yangtze River Bridge united the Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway with the Guangdong\u2013Hankou Railway into the Beijing\u2013Guangzhou Railway, making Wuhan a 'thoroughfare to nine provinces' (\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862) in name and in fact.\nAfter Chengdu Conference, Mao went to Chongqing and Wuhan in April to inspect the countryside and factories. In Wuhan, he called all the leaders of provinces and municipalities who had not attended Chengdu Conference to report their work. Tian Jiaying, the secretary of Mao, said that Wuhan Conference was a supplement to Chengdu Conference.In July 1967, civil strife struck the city in the Wuhan Incident (\"July 20th Incident\"), an armed conflict between two hostile groups who were fighting for control over the city at the height of the Cultural Revolution.In 1981, the Wuhan City Government commenced reconstruction of the Yellow Crane Tower at a new location, about 1 km (0.62 mi) from the original site, and it was completed in 1985. In 1957, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was built with one trestle of the bridge on the site of the tower, which had been last destroyed in 1884.During the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, students in Wuhan blocked the Yangtze River Railway bridge and another 4,000 gathered at the railway station. About one thousand students staged a railroad 'sit-in'. Rail traffic on the Beijing-Guangzhou and Wuhan-Dalian lines was interrupted. The students also urged employees of major state-owned enterprises to go on strike. The situation was so tense that residents reportedly began a bank run and resorted to panic-buying.\n\nIn the wake of the United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade on May 7, 1999, protests broke out throughout China, including in Wuhan.On June 22, 2000, a Wuhan Airlines flight from Enshi to Wuhan was forced to circle for 30 minutes due to thunderstorms. The aircraft eventually crashed on the banks of Han River in Hanyang District, all on-board perished (there were varying accounts of number of crews and passengers). In addition, the crash also killed 7 people on the ground.Chinese protesters organized boycotts of the French-owned retail chain Carrefour in major Chinese cities including Kunming, Hefei and Wuhan, accusing the French nation of pro-secessionist conspiracy and anti-Chinese racism. The BBC reported that hundreds of people demonstrated in Beijing, Wuhan, Hefei, Kunming and Qingdao. On May 19, 2011, Fang Binxing, the Principal of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (also known as \"Father of China's Great Fire Wall\") was hit on the chest by a shoe thrown at him by a Huazhong University of Science and Technology student who calls herself \"hanjunyi\" (\u5bd2\u541b\u4f9d, or \u5c0f\u6e56\u5317) while Fang was giving a lecture at Wuhan University.The city has been subject to devastating floods, which are now supposed to be controlled by the ambitious Three Gorges Dam, a project which was completed in 2008. The 2008 Chinese winter storms damaged water supply equipment in Wuhan: up to 100,000 people were out of running water when several water pipes burst, cutting the supply to local households. The 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat wave hit Wuhan on July 3.\nIn the 2010 China floods, the Han River at Wuhan experienced its worst flooding in twenty years, as officials continued sandbagging efforts along the Han and Yangtze Rivers in the city and checked reservoirs. In the 2011 China floods, Wuhan was flooded, with parts of the city losing power. In the 2016 China floods, Wuhan saw 570 mm (22 in) of rainfall during the first week of July, surpassing the record that fell on the city in 1991. A red alert for heavy rainfall was issued on 2 July, the same day that eight people died after a 15-meter (49 ft) section of a 2 m (6.6 ft) tall wall collapsed on top of them. The city's subway system, the Wuhan Metro was partially submerged as was the main railway station. At least 14 city residents were killed, one was missing, and more than 80,000 were relocated.In early July 2019, there were protests against plans for a new incinerator in Xinzhou District.The 2019 Military World Games were hosted in Wuhan in October.\nIn December 2019, an epidemic of a new coronavirus disease began in Wuhan. The disease, which became known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), spread and developed into the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Wuhan and other Hubei cities were placed under lockdown for nearly three months to contain the disease. On April 8, 2020, the Wuhan lockdown officially came to an end after no new domestic cases were reported in Hubei province.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Overview ===\n\nWuhan is in east-central Hubei, at latitude 29\u00b0 58'\u201331\u00b0 22' N and longitude 113\u00b0 41'\u2013115\u00b0 05' E. Wuhan sits at the confluence of the Han River flowing into the Yangtze River at the East of the Jianghan Plain along the Yangtze's middle reaches.\nThe metropolitan area comprises three parts\u2014Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang\u2014commonly called the \"Three Towns of Wuhan\" (hence the name \"Wuhan\", combining \"Wu\" from the first city and \"Han\" from the other two). The consolidation of these cities occurred in 1927 and Wuhan was thereby established. The three former cities face each other across the rivers and are linked by bridges, including one of the first modern bridges in China, known as the \"First Bridge\".\n\nWuchang lies South East of the Yangtze River that separates it from both Hankou and Hanyang.\nHankou sits North of the Yangtze River separating it from Wuchang. Hankou is North of the Han River separating it from Hanyang.\nHanyang lies West of the Yangtze separating it from Wuchang. Hanyang is south of the Han river separating it from Hankou.\nIt is simple in terrain \u2014 low and flat in the middle and hilly in the south, with the Yangtze and Han rivers winding through the city. The She River enters the Yangtze in Huangpi District. Wuhan occupies a land area of 8,494.41 square kilometers (3,279.71 sq mi), most of which is alluvial plain and decorated with hills and a great number of lakes and ponds. Water makes up one quarter of Wuhan's urban territory, which is the highest percentage among  major cities in China. Wuhan has nearly 200 lakes, including the East Lake of 33 km2, and Tangxun Lake, which are the largest lakes entirely within a city in China.Other well-known lakes include South Lake and Sand Lake. Liangzi Lake, the largest lake by surface area in Hubei province, is located in the southeast of Jiangxia District. At 709 m (2,326 ft) above sea level, the highest point in Wuhan is the main peak of Yunwu Mountain (\u4e91\u96fe\u5c71) in northwestern Huangpi District. There are also several mountains within the city limits of Wuhan including Mount Luojia (\u73de\u73c8\u5c71) in Wuchang District as well as Mount Hong (\u6d2a\u5c71) and Mount Yujia (\u55bb\u5bb6\u5c71/\u745c\u73c8\u5c71) in Hongshan District.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nWuhan's climate is humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) with abundant rainfall in summer and four distinctive seasons. Wuhan is known for its humid summers, when dewpoints can often reach 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) or more. Historically, along with Chongqing and Nanjing, Wuhan is referred to as one of the \"Three Furnacelike Cities\" along the Yangtze River for their hot summers. However, the climate data of recent years suggests that Wuhan is no longer among the top tier of \"The hottest cities in summer\" list, the New Four Furnacelike Cities are Chongqing, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, and Nanchang. Spring and autumn are generally mild, while winter is cool with quite low rainfall and occasional snow. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from 4.0 \u00b0C (39.2 \u00b0F) in January to 29.1 \u00b0C (84.4 \u00b0F) in July. Annual precipitation totals just under 1,320 mm (52 in), the majority of which falls from April to July; the annual mean temperature is 17.13 \u00b0C (62.8 \u00b0F), the frost-free period lasts 211 to 272 days. With monthly possible sunshine percentage ranging from 31 percent in March to 59 percent in August, the city proper receives 1,865 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extreme low and high temperatures recorded are \u221218.1 \u00b0C (\u22121 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1977 and 39.7 \u00b0C (103 \u00b0F) on 27 July 2017 (unofficial record of 41.3 \u00b0C (106 \u00b0F) in 1934).\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nWuhan is a sub-provincial city. Municipal government is regulated by the local Communist Party of China (CPC), led by the Wuhan CPC Secretary (Chinese: \u6b66\u6c49\u5e02\u59d4\u4e66\u8bb0), Wang Zhonglin (\u738b\u5fe0\u6797). The local CPC issues administrative orders, collects taxes, manages the economy, and directs a standing committee of the Municipal People's Congress in making policy decisions and overseeing the local government.\nGovernment officials include the mayor (\u5e02\u957f), Zhou Xianwang (\u5468\u5148\u65fa), and vice-mayors. Numerous bureaus focus on law, public security, and other affairs.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nThe sub-provincial city of Wuhan currently comprises 13 districts. As of the Sixth Census of China in 2010, the 13 districts comprised 160 township-level divisions including 156 subdistricts, 3 towns, 1 townships.\n\n\n=== Diplomatic missions ===\n\nThere are four countries that have consulates in Wuhan:\n\nThe current U.S. Consul General, the Honorable Mr. Jamie Fouss, was posted to Wuhan in August 2017. The office of the U.S. Consulate General, Central China (located in Wuhan) celebrated its official opening on November 20, 2008 and is the first new American consulate in China in over 20 years. The consulate is currently scheduled to offer visa and citizen services in the Fall of 2018.\nIn 2015, Japan\nand Russia announced their intentions to establish consular offices in Wuhan.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nUp until the 21st century, Wuhan was largely an agricultural region. Since 2004 it has been a focal point of the Rise of Central China Plan, which aims to build less-developed inland economies into hubs of advanced manufacturing.\nSince 1890, the steel industry has been the backbone of Wuhan's industry. In 2010, automobile industry exceeded GDP for Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO) steel for the first time. There are 5 car manufacturers, including Dongfeng Honda, Citroen, Shanghai GM, DFM Passenger Vehicle and Dongfeng Renault. Dongfeng-Citroen Automobile Co., Ltd is headquartered in the city.As of 2016, Wuhan has attracted foreign investment from over 80 countries, with 5,973 foreign-invested enterprises established in the city with a total capital injection of $22.45 billion USD. Among these, about 50 French companies including Renault and PSA Group have operations in the city, representing over one third of French investment in China, and the highest level of French investment in any Chinese city.Wuhan is an important center for economy, trade, finance, transportation, information technology, and education in China. Its major industries include optic-electronic, automobile manufacturing, iron and steel manufacturing, new pharmaceutical sector, biology engineering, new materials industry and environmental protection.  Environmental sustainability is highlighted in Wuhan's list of emerging industries, which include energy efficiency technology and renewable energy.\n\n\n=== Industrial zones ===\nMajor industrial zones in Wuhan include in chronological order:\n\nWuhan Economic and Technological Development ZoneWuhan Economic and Technological Development Zone is a national level industrial zone incorporated in 1993. Its current zone size is about 10\u201325 square km and it plans to expand to 25\u201350 square km. Industries encouraged in Wuhan Economic and Technological Development Zone include Auto-mobile Production/Assembly, Biotechnology/Pharmaceuticals, Chemicals Production and Processing, Food/Beverage Processing, Heavy Industry, and Telecommunications Equipment.\n\nWuhan Export Processing ZoneWuhan Export Processing Zone was established in 2000. It is located in Wuhan Economic and Technology Development Zone, planned to cover 2.7 square kilometers (1.0 square mile) of land. The first 0.7-square-kilometer (0.3-square-mile) area has already been created.\nWuhan Donghu New Technology Development ZoneWuhan Donghu New Technology Development Zone is a national level high-tech development zone. Optical-electronics, telecommunications, and equipment manufacturing are the core industries of Wuhan East Lake High-Tech Development Zone (ELHTZ) while software outsourcing and electronics are also encouraged. ELHTZ is China's largest production center for optoelectronic products with key players like Yangtze Optical Fiber and Cable, (the largest fiber-optical cable maker in China), and Fiberhome Telecommunications. Wuhan Donghu New Technology Development Zone also represents the development center for China's laser industry with key players such as HG Tech and Chutian Laser being based in the zone.\nWuhan Optical Valley (Guanggu) Software ParkWuhan Optical Valley (Guanggu) Software Park is located in Wuhan Donghu New Technology Development Zone. Wuhan Optics Valley Software Park is jointly developed by East Lake High-Tech Development Zone and Dalian Software Park Co., Ltd. The planned area is 0.67 square kilometers (0.26 square miles) with total floor area of 6,000,000 square meters (65,000,000 square feet). The zone is 8.5 km (5.28 mi) away from the 316 National Highway and is 46.7 km (29.02 mi) away from the Wuhan Tianhe Airport.\n\nWuhan BiolakeBiolake is an industrial base established in 2008 in the Optics Valley of China. Located in East Lake New Technology Development Zone of Wuhan, Biolake covers 15 km2 (5.8 sq mi), and has six parks including Bio-innovation Park, Bio-pharma Park, Bio-agriculture Park, Bio-manufacturing Park, Medical Device Park and Medical Health Park, to accommodate both research activities and living.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nWuhan is the most populous city in Central China and among the most populous in China.  In the Sixth Census of China in 2010, Wuhan's built-up area made of 8 out of 10 urban districts (all but Xinzhou and Hannan not yet conurbated) was home to 8,821,658 inhabitants. As of 2015, the city of Wuhan had an estimated population of 10,607,700 people.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 19 million.\nAs of November 2019, urban development status considering both spatial and socioeconomic processes has been examined using Night Time Lighting data and land cover data as proxies; it showed Wuhan's high concentration\nof socioeconomic activities compared to its urban spatial development.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nAccording to a survey published in 2017, 79.2% of the population of Wuhan are either irreligious or practice worship of gods and ancestors; among these 0.9% are Taoists. Among other religious doctrines, 14.7% of the population adheres to Buddhism, 2.9% to Protestantism, 0.3% to Catholicism and 1.6% to Islam, and 1.6% of the population adheres to unspecified other religions.\nReligious sites in Wuhan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nChina Railway Wuhan Group manages the Wuhan Railway Hub. Wuhan Railway Hub is considered one of the four key railway hubs of China. The city of Wuhan is served by three major railway stations: the Hankou Railway Station in Hankou, the Wuchang Railway Station in Wuchang, and the Wuhan Railway Station, located in a newly developed area east of the East Lake (Hongshan District). As the stations are many miles apart, it is important for passengers to be aware of the particular station(s) used by a particular train.\nThe (original) Hankou Station was the terminus for the Jinghan Railway from Beijing, while the Wuchang Station was the terminus for the Yuehan Railway to Guangzhou. Since the construction of the First Yangtze Bridge and the linking of the two lines into the Jingguang Railway, both Hankou and Wuchang stations have been served by trains going to all directions, which contrasts with the situation in such cities as New York or Moscow, where different stations serve different directions.\nWith the opening of the Hefei-Wuhan high-speed railway on April 1, 2009, Wuhan became served by high-speed trains with Hefei, Nanjing, and Shanghai; several trains a day now connect the city with Shanghai, getting there in under 6 hours. As of early 2010, most of these express trains leave from the Hankou Railway Station.\n\nIn 2006, construction began on the new Wuhan Railway Station with 11 platforms, located on the northeastern outskirts of the city. In December 2009, the station was opened, as China unveiled its second high-speed train with scheduled runs from Guangzhou to Wuhan. Billed as the fastest train in the world, it can reach a speed of 394 km/h (244.82 mph). The travel time between the two cities has been reduced from ten and a half hours to just three. The rail service has been extended north to Beijing.As of 2011, the new Wuhan Railway Station is primarily used by the Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed trains, while most regular trains to other destinations continue to use the Hankou and Wuchang stations.\n\nConstruction work is carried out on several lines of the new Wuhan Metropolitan Area Intercity Railway, which will eventually connect Wuhan's three main rail terminals with several stations throughout the city's outer areas and farther suburbs, as well as with the nearby cities of Xianning, Huangshi, Huanggang, and Xiaogan. The first line of the system, the one to Xianning, opened for passenger operations at the end of 2013. The line to Xiaogen opened on 1 December 2016 and it was extended with the opening of the Wuhan\u2013Shiyan high-speed railway to Shiyan on 29 November 2019.The main freight railway station and classification yard of the Wuhan metropolitan area is the extensive Wuhan North railway station, with 112 tracks and over 650 switches. It is located in Hengdian Subdistrict of Huangpi District, located 20 km (12 mi) north of the Wuhan Station and 23 km (14 mi) from Hankou Station.\n\n\n=== Wuhan Metro ===\n\nWuhan Metro is a rapid transit system serving the city of Wuhan. Owned and operated by Wuhan Metro Group Co., Ltd., the network now includes 9 lines, 228 stations, and 339 km (211 mi) of route length. Line 1, the first line in the system, opened on 28 July 2004, which made Wuhan became the seventh city in mainland China with rapid transit system, after Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Changchun, and Dalian. Line 2 opened on 28 December 2012 and is the first underground metro line crossing the Yangtze River. With 1.22 billion annual passengers in 2019, Wuhan Metro is the sixth-busiest rapid transit system in mainland China. There are a number of lines or sections under construction. The government of Wuhan City promised the citizens that at least two lines or sections open every year. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire network was out of service from 23 January to 27 March 2020.\n\n\n=== Trams ===\n\nTrams were brought to the streets of Wuhan on July 28, 2017 with the first line (Auto-city T1 Line) opened that day. The trams under construction or planning in Wuhan are:\n\nAuto-city trams, with Lines T1, T2, T6, and T8 in the Wuhan Economic Development Area, in the far western reaches on Hanyang. T1 Line is operational as of 2017.\nOptics Valley trams, two lines  (T1 and T2) south and east of Guanggu Circle (Guanggu Guangchang) in southeastern Wuchang. The system opened on January 18, 2018.\nThe Old Hankou Streetcar, a loop line around Hankou city.\n\n\n=== Maritime transport ===\nWuhan is a major hub for maritime transport in central China. The Port of Wuhan provide services for the local population and shipping services.\n\n\n=== Ferry ===\nAs a city located at bank of Yangtze River, Wuhan has long history of ferry services. Modern ferry services were established in 1900 by steam boat. In 1937, a train ferry was established to transport train cars from Hankou to Wuchang. There are numbered stops around Wuhan where people can get on and off the ferry and there is a tourist ferry in the night.\nCurrently, ferry services are provided by the Wuhan Ferry Company. In 2010, the company bought 10 new ships to replace the ones that had been in service for 29 years.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nOpened in April 1995 to substitute for the old Hankou Wangjiadun Airport and Nanhu Airport as the major airport of Wuhan, Wuhan Tianhe International Airport is one of the busiest airports in central China. It is located in Wuhan's suburban Huangpi District 26 kilometers (16 mi) north of Wuhan city proper. The extension of Line 2 of Wuhan Metro to Tianhe Airport opened on 28 December 2016. It has also been selected as China's fourth international hub airport after Beijing Capital International Airport, Shanghai-Pudong and Guangzhou Baiyun. A second terminal was completed in March 2008, having been started in February 2005 with an investment of CNY 3.372 billion. International flights to neighboring Asian countries have also been enhanced, including direct flights to Tokyo and Nagoya, Japan. Terminal 3 has been available for service since early 2017.\nHannan Municipal Airport is an municipal airport that serves Hannan District. It is the biggest airport in China that only handles general aviation, and the biggest municipal airport in Hubei Province. Caidian Municipal Airport is an under-construction airport which will serve Caidian District. The airport began construction on 1 December 2017.\n\n\n=== Highways and expressways ===\nNumerous major highways and expressways pass through Wuhan, including:\n\nChina National Highway 107\nChina National Highway 316\nChina National Highway 318\nG42 Shanghai\u2013Chengdu Expressway\nG0422 Wuhan\u2013Shenzhen Expressway\n\n\n=== Bicycle-sharing system ===\nAs of May 2011, the Wuhan and Hangzhou Public Bicycle bike-share systems in China were the largest in the world, with around 90,000 and 60,000 bicycles respectively. In 2012 the Wuhan and Hangzhou Public Bicycle programs in China are the largest in the world, with around 90,000 and 60,000 bicycles respectively. China has seen a rise in private \"dockless\" bike shares with fleets that dwarf systems in size outside China. Initially, a number of traditional (third generation) docked public bike systems operated by local municipal governments opened across China, with the largest ones being in Wuhan and Hangzhou.  The first was introduced in Beijing in 2007.  However, third generation bike sharing is not considered successful for the majority cities in China.  Bike sharing in Beijing virtually stopped and it also has encountered difficulties in Shanghai and Wuhan.\n\n\n== Destinations ==\n\nThe Yellow Crane Tower (Huanghelou) is presumed to have been first built in approximately 220 AD. The tower has been destroyed and reconstructed numerous times, and was burned last according to some sources in 1884. The tower underwent complete reconstruction in 1981. The reconstruction utilized modern materials and added an elevator while maintaining the traditional design in the tower's outward appearance.\nWuchang has the largest and second largest lakes within a city in China, the East Lake and Tangxun Lake, as well as the South Lake. East Lake in Wuhan is six times the size of the West Lake in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province. The total area is more than 80 km2 (31 sq mi) of which the lake is covering an area of 33 km2 (13 sq mi). In the springtime, the shores of East Lake become a garden of flowers with the Mei blossoms as the king and the Cherry Blossom as the queen among the species at East Lake Cherry Blossom Park. Another famous flower is the lotus. The lake has a long history and especially the Chu Kingdom is well represented around East Lake. Moreover, in the Moshan Botanic Garden there are many types of plum blossoms, as well as lotus flowers.\nThe Hubei Provincial Museum: With over 200,000 valued artifacts, this is one of the leading museums in China. Especially the artefacts from the tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng (Zeng Hou Yi), who lived in the 5th century B.C., is a world unique treasure. The bell chime of Marquis Yi of Zeng is a bronze instrument performed 2430 years ago in ancient China (Warring States Period), and was discovered in the Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng in Suizhou, Hubei in 1978. The whole chime weighs 5 tons, can perfectly play sound which was heard 2430 years ago, and was considered \"The Eighth Wonder of the World\".\nThe Wuhan Museum has a collection of more than 100,000 artifacts, including ceramic, bronze ware, paintings and calligraphy, jade, wood carving, enamel ware, seals and so on.

This is the birthplace of the renowned legend of seeking a soul mate through \"high mountains and flowing water\". According to the story behind the Chinese word '\u77e5\u97f3' (zh\u012by\u012bn; 'understanding music'), Yu Boya played for the last time over the grave of his friend Zhong Ziqi, then smashed his lute because the only person able to appreciate his music was dead.\nMao's Villa (\u6bdb\u6fa4\u6771\u5225\u5885), Mao Zedong's villa between 1960 and 1974; includes garden, living quarters, conference room, bomb shelter and swimming pool.\nSome luxury riverboat tours begin here after a flight from Beijing or Shanghai, with several days of flatland cruising and then climbing through the Three Gorges with passage upstream past the Gezhouba and Three Gorges dams to the city of Chongqing. With the completion of the dam, a number of cruises now start from the upstream side and continue west, with tourists traveling by motorcoach from Wuhan.\nWuying Pagoda or the \"Shadowless Pagoda\" is the oldest standing architectural feature in Wuhan, dating from the closing days of the Southern Song Dynasty.\nChu River and Han Street, a shopping district located in Wuchang with many tourist attractions, including Han Show theater, Madame Tussauds wax museum, and Movie Culture Park, etc. This project was initiated as a water connecting channel between East Lake and Shahu Lake.\nWuhan Zoo in Hanyang.\nThe Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market is a live animal and seafood market in the Jianghan District.

It is, \"the key laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences for newly emerging and fulminating infectious disease pathogen and biosecurity.\"\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Schools and universities ===\n\nThere are 35 higher educational institutions in Wuhan, making it a leading educational hub for China. Prominent institutions include Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Wuhan University. Three state-level development zones and many enterprise incubators are also significant in Wuhan's education and business development. Wuhan ranks third in China in overall strength of science and technology.As of the end of 2013, in Wuhan there were 1,024 kindergartens with 224,300 children, 590 primary schools with 424,000 students, 369 general high schools with 314,000 students, 105 secondary vocational and technical schools with 98,600 students, and 80 colleges and universities with 966,400 undergraduates and junior college students and 107,400 postgraduate students. There are several international schools in Wuhan.\nHuazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), located in the Optics Valley of China near East Lake, is a Project 985 and Class A Double First Class University. HUST manages Wuhan National Laboratories for Opto-electronics (WNLO), which is one of the five national laboratories in China. HUST is also one of four Chinese universities eligible to run the national laboratory and the national major science and technology infrastructure. Founded in 1953 as Huazhong Institute of Technology, it combined with three other universities (including former Tongji Medical University founded in 1907) in 2000 to form the new HUST, and has 42 schools and departments covering 12 comprehensive disciplines. HUST has 12 Fellows of Chinese Academy of Sciences and 17 Fellows of Chinese Academy of Engineering. U.S. News' 2019 U.S. News & World Report  ranked HUST as 260th in the world, and 9th in China  while QS World University Rankings has it ranked 400th in the world. More than 2,000 international students from 120 countries pursue degrees at HUST.Wuhan University is another Project 985 and Class A Double First Class University, which was ranked 257th by QS World University Rankings and 285th by U.S. News; established in 1893, the old Wuhan University absorbed three other schools (two of them being its spin-offs since the 1950s) in 2000 to become a university with 36 schools in 6 faculties. Since the 1950s it has received international students from more than 109 countries.\n\n\n=== Scientific research ===\n\nWuhan contains three national development zones and four scientific and technological development parks, as well as numerous enterprise incubators, over 350 research institutes, 1470 high-tech enterprises, and over 400,000 experts and technicians.\nFounded in 1958, the Wuhan Branch of Chinese Academy of Sciences is one of the twelve national branches of CAS. It is composed of 9 independent organizations, including the headquarters at Xiaohongshan, Wuchang. It has had a staff of 3,900, among which 8 are CAS fellows, and one is a Chinese Academy of Engineering fellow. As of 2013, the achievements gained by WHB had won 23 National Awards and 778 Provincial Awards. Wuhan Research Institute of Post and Telecommunications (now known as FiberHome Technologies Group) is the national center for optical communication research in China, and is where the first optical fiber in the country was produced.Wuhan University of Technology is another major national university in the area. Founded in the year 2000, it was merged from three major universities, Wuhan University of Technology (established in 1948), Wuhan Transportation University (established in 1946) and Wuhan Automotive Polytechnic University (established in 1958). Wuhan University of Technology is one of the leading Chinese universities accredited by the Ministry of Education and one of the universities constructed with priority by \"State Project 211\" for Chinese higher education institutions. The University has three main campuses located in the Wuchang District.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe headquarters of Hubei Television is located in Wuchang District. Tortoise Mountain TV Tower is China's first self-developed TV tower, opened in 1986. The modern newspapers in Wuhan can be dated back to 1866, when Hankow Times, a newspaper in English, was founded. Before 1949, more than 50 newspapers and magazines were published by foreigners in Wuhan. Chao-wen Hsin-pao, founded by Ai Xiaomei in 1873, was the first Chinese newspaper to appear in Hankou (one of the cities that was merged into Wuhan). During the Northern Expedition era (1926\u20131928), journalism in Wuhan came to a climax; more than 120 newspapers and periodicals, including national newspapers such as Central Daily News and Republican Daily News, were founded or published during this time. Chutian Metropolis Daily and Wuhan Evening News are two major local commercial tabloid newspapers. Both of them have entered the list of 100 most widely circulated newspapers of the world.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe plum blossom is the city's emblem, chosen partly because of the long history of local plum cultivation and use, and partly to recognize the plum's current economic significance in terms of cultivation and research. Local wild plums were used medicinally during the Qin and Han dynasties. Cultivation of the fruit began during the Song dynasty. Some traditional new year customs revolve around the planting of plums.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nWuhan natives speak a variety of Southwestern Mandarin Chinese referred to as Wuhan dialect that differs slightly between the districts of Wuhan, including Wuchang dialect in Wuchang District, Hankou dialect in the Hankou districts, Hanyang dialect in Hanyang District, and Qingshan dialect in Qingshan District.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nHubei cuisine is one of China's ten major styles of cooking. With a history of more than 2,000 years, Hubei cuisine, originating in ancient Chu cuisine, has developed a number of distinctive dishes, such as steamed blunt-snout bream in clear soup, preserved ham with flowering Chinese cabbage, and others. On the third day of the third month of the lunar calendar, many in Wuhan eat d\u00ecc\u00e0i zh\u01d4 j\u012bd\u00e0n (\u5730\u83dc\u716e\u9e21\u86cb), an egg dish which is supposed to prevent illness in the coming year.\"No need to be particular about the recipes; all foods have their own uses. Rice wine and tangyuan are excellent midnight snacks, while fat bream and flowering Chinese cabbages are great delicacies.\" This attitude expressed in Hankou Zhuzhici reflects indirectly the eating habits and a wide variety of distinctive snacks with a long history in Wuhan, such as Qingshuizong (a pyramid-shaped dumpling made of glutinous rice wrapped in bamboo or reed leaves) in the Period of the Warring States, Chunbinbian in Northern and Southern dynasties, mung bean jelly in the Sui dynasty, youguo (a deep-fried twisted dough stick) in the Song and Yuan dynasties, rice wine and mianwo in the Ming and Qing dynasties, as well as three-delicacy stuffed skin of bean milk, tangbao (steamed dumpling filled with minced meat and gravy) and hot braised noodles (reganmian) in modern times.\nGuozao (\u904e\u65e9) is a popular way to say 'having breakfast' in Wuhan, and a part of the city's culture. As a hub for land transport in China, Wuhan has gathered and mixed together various habits and customs from neighboring cities and provinces in all directions, which gives rise to a concentration of diverse cuisines from different places. The most famous place to guozao (have breakfast) is Hubu Street (\u6236\u90e8\u5df7), a 150-meter-long street in the neighborhood of Simenkou (\u53f8\u95e8\u53e3). Along its short length one can find nearly all the traditional foods of Wuhan, such as:\n\nHot and dry noodles, re-gan mian (\u70ed\u5e72\u9762), consists of long freshly boiled noodles mixed with sesame paste. It is considered to be the most typical local food for breakfast.\nDuck's neck or Ya Bozi (\u9e2d\u8116\u5b50) is a local version of this popular Chinese dish, made of duck necks and spices.\nBean skin or doupi (\u8c46\u76ae) is a local dish with a filling of egg, rice, beef, mushrooms and beans cooked between two large round soybean skins and cut into pieces, structurally like a stuffed pizza without enclosing edges.\nSoup dumpling or xiaolongtangbao (\u5c0f\u7b3c\u6c64\u5305) is a kind of dumpling with thin skin made of flour, steamed with very juicy meat inside, hence the name: tang (soup) bao (bun) \u2013 every time one takes a bite from it the \"soup\" inside is liable to spill out.\nA salty doughnut or mianwo (\u9eaa\u7aa9) is a kind of savory donut with a salty taste. It is much thinner than a common donut and is a typical Wuhan local food.\n\n\n=== Opera ===\nHan opera, which is the local opera of Wuhan area, was one of China's oldest and most popular operas. During the late Qing dynasty, Han opera, blended with Hui opera, gave birth to Peking opera, the most popular opera in modern China. Thus Han opera has been called the \"mother of Peking opera.\"\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nWuhan has a professional football team, Wuhan Zall F.C., that plays in the Chinese Super League. Xinhua Road Sport Center, the team's home stadium, with a capacity of 32,137, is located in the heart of the city next to Zhongshan Park. For the 2013 season, Wuhan Zall was promoted to the top-tier league of Chinese football, Chinese Super League, and relocated its home to Wuhan Sports Center Stadium, a modern stadium with 54,357 seats located in the suburbs of the city. However, the team did not play well in the ensuing season and was demoted back to China League One as the 2013 season ended. For financial and transportation reasons, the team moved back to Xinhua Road Sport Center in 2014.\nThe Wuhan Gators are a professional arena football team based in Wuhan. They are members of the China Arena Football League (CAFL).The 13,000-seat Wuhan Gymnasium held the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship and was one of the venues for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup. The 7th Military World Games were hosted in Wuhan from Oct. 18 to 27, 2019.The city has been the venue for the women's tennis tournament, the Wuhan Open, one of the WTA's Premier 5 tournaments, since 2014.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Bridges ===\n\nWuhan has eleven bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze River. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also called the First Bridge, was built over the Yangtze in 1957, carrying a railroad directly across the river between hills known as Snake Hill and Turtle Hill. Before this bridge was built it could take up to an entire day to barge railcars across. Including its approaches, it is 5,511 feet (1,680 m) long, and it accommodates both a double-track railway on a lower deck and a four-lane roadway above. It was built with the assistance of advisers from the Soviet Union.\nThe Second Bridge, a cable-stayed bridge built of prestressed concrete, has a central span of 400 meters (1,300 feet); it is 4,678 meters (15,348 feet) in length (including 1,877 meters (6,158 feet) of the main bridge) and 26.5 to 33.5 meters (86.9 to 109.9 feet) in width. Its main bridgeheads are 90 meters (300 feet) high each, pulling 392 thick slanting cables together in the shape of double fans so that the central span of the bridge is well poised on the piers and the bridge's stability and vibration resistance are ensured. With six lanes on the deck, the bridge is designed to handle the daily passage of 50,000 motor vehicles. The bridge was completed in 1995.\n\nThe Third Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also called Baishazhou Bridge, was completed in September 2000. Located 8.6 kilometers (5.3 miles) southwest of the First Bridge, construction of Baishazhou Bridge started in 1997. With an investment of over 1.4 billion yuan (about US$170,000,000), the bridge, which is 3,586 meters (11,765 feet) long and 26.5 meters (86.9 feet) wide, has six lanes and has a capacity of 50,000 vehicles a day. The bridge is expected to serve as a major passage for the future Wuhan Ring Road, greatly easing the city's traffic and aiding local economic development.\nThe Yangluo Bridge carries Wuhan's Ring Road across the Yangtze in the city's eastern suburbs (connecting the Hongshan District with the Xinzhou District). It was opened on December 26, 2007.\nThe Wuhan Tianxingzhou Yangtze River Bridge crosses the Yangtze in the northeastern part of the city, downstream of the Second bridge. It is named after Tianxing Island (Tianxingzhou), above which it crosses the river. Built at a cost of 11 billion yuan, the 4,657-meter cable suspension bridge was opened on December 26, 2009, in time for the opening of the Wuhan Railway Station. It is a combined road and rail bridge, and carries the Wuhan\u2013Guangzhou High-Speed Railway across the river.\n\n\n=== Skyscrapers ===\n\nThe Yellow Crane Tower, historically one of the tallest buildings in Wuhan, is considered one of the Four Great Towers of China and was destroyed twelve times, both by warfare and by fire. The tower is classified as an AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration. At 438 meters (1,437 ft) in height, the Wuhan Center skyscraper, the tallest structure in Wuhan and in Central China, is the eighth tallest structure in China. The Minsheng Bank Building, the second tallest structure in Wuhan, was the tallest building in Wuhan when it was completed in 2007. It retained the title until Wuhan Center surpassed it in 2014. Wuhan World Trade Tower is a 273-meter (896 foot) tall skyscraper located in Wuhan. It became the tallest building in Wuhan after its completion in 1998. However, it was surpassed by the Minsheng Bank Building in 2007.\nThe Wuhan Greenland Center is a planned 636-meter (2,087 ft), 126-floor mixed-use skyscraper currently under construction and scheduled for completion in 2019. If completed as planned, it will be among the world's tallest structures, and one of the world's tallest buildings by occupiable floor height. The Phoenix Towers are proposed supertall skyscrapers planned for construction in Wuhan. At 1 kilometer (3,300 ft) high, the towers would also be among the tallest structures in the world when completed.\n\n\n== Notable Wuhanese ==\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nLi Yuanhong \u2013 former President of the Republic of China (1916\u201317, 1922\u201323).\nWu Yi \u2013 former Vice-Premier and Minister of Health of the People's Republic of China\n\n\n=== Business ===\nWei Brian - Chinese entrepreneur\n\n\n=== Science ===\nChang-Lin Tien \u2013 seventh Chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley (1990\u20131997) and a major founder of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering (NAE).

        "wiki": "This article documents the chronology and epidemiology of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, which was first detected in Wuhan, China. Some developments may become known or fully understood only in retrospect. (This omnibus timeline is divided into monthly sections and articles: The preceding page covers November to December 2019, this chronological section covers January 2020, the next one covers February 2020, and so on.)\n\n\n== Pandemic chronology ==\n\n\n=== 1 January 2020 ===\n\nAccording to information reported by the South China Morning Post on 13 March 2020, Chinese authorities had identified 266 infected people before the beginning of 2020.According to the Chinese state-sponsored Xinhua News, the Huanan Seafood Market was closed on 1 January 2020 for \"renovation\". However, in the Consortium's report of 24 January 2020, it was stated that the Huanan Seafood Market had been closed on 1 January 2020 for \"cleaning and disinfection. However, the virus could only stay on surfaces for so long so this was useless.\"US CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield was briefed about the severity of the virus from his Chinese counterparts Dr. George F. Gao when he was on vacation with his family - according to reports, what he heard \"rattled him.\"WHO in its Newsroom: Emergencies preparedness, the response said \"the causal agent has not yet been identified or confirmed\" and has requested further information from the Chinese authorities to assess the risk.\n\n\n=== 2 January ===\nOn 2 January, 41 admitted hospital patients in Wuhan, China, were confirmed to have contracted (laboratory-confirmed) the 2019-nCoV (novel coronavirus); 27 (66%) patients had direct exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. All 41 patients were subsequently relocated from the hospital they had originally been diagnosed in to the Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, China. WHO declared that its three concerned levels (China country office, Regional Office for the Western Pacific and headquarters) have been working together to respond to the outbreak.\n\n\n=== 3 January ===\nChinese scientists at the National Institute of Viral Disease Control and Prevention (IVDC) ruled out the possibilities for 26 common respiratory pathogens, including influenza A and B virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus metapneumovirus rhinovirus, enterovirus, and other common respiratory viruses. They determined the genetic sequence of the novel \u03b2-genus coronaviruses (naming it '2019-nCoV') from specimens collected from patients in Wuhan, China, and three distinct strains were established.Health authorities in Wuhan reported 44 cases, a big jump from the 27 reported on Tuesday. Eleven of the 44 were seriously ill, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said, although there had been no reported deaths to date. The health of the 121 close contacts of the cases was being monitored.Dr. Li Wenliang, a Wuhan ophthalmologist, was summoned to the Wuhan Public Security Bureau where he was told to sign an official confession and admonition letter promising to cease spreading false \"rumors\" regarding the coronavirus. In the letter, he was reprimanded for \"making false comments by announcing the confirmation of 7 cases of SARS at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market\" that had \"severely disturbed the social order\". The letter stated, \"We solemnly warn you: If you keep being stubborn, with such impertinence, and continue this illegal activity, you will be brought to justice\u2014is that understood?\" Li signed the confession writing: \"Yes, I understand.\"China formally notified US on the outbreak. At a White House briefing in March 20, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said officials had been alerted to the initial reports of the virus by discussions between CDC director Robert Redfield and Chinese CDC Director Dr. Gao  on Jan. 3. Mr. Azar also told his chief of staff to make sure that the National Security Council was aware that \"this (the outbreak) is a very big deal\" \n\n\n=== 4 January ===\nThe head of the University of Hong Kong's Centre for Infection, Ho Pak-Leung, warned that the city should implement the strictest possible monitoring system for a mystery new viral pneumonia that infected dozens of people on the mainland, as it was highly possible that the illness was spreading from human to human. The microbiologist also warned that there could be a surge in cases during the upcoming Chinese New Year. Ho said he hoped the mainland would release more details as soon as possible about the patients infected with the disease, such as their medical history, to help experts analyze the illness and to allow for more effective preventive measures to be put in place.The Singapore Ministry of Health said on Saturday, 4 January, that it had been notified of the first suspected case of the \"mystery Wuhan virus\" in Singapore, involving a three-year-old girl from China who had pneumonia and a travel history to the Chinese city of Wuhan.\nOn 5 January, the Singapore Ministry of Health released a press statement stating that the earlier suspected case was not linked to the pneumonia cluster in Wuhan and was also tested negative for the  SARS and MERS-CoV.Chinese officials were criticized for failing to disclose any information about the \"mysterious virus\" that machine translations of official reports suggested may be caused by a new coronavirus.The WHO waited for China to release information about the \"mysterious new pneumonia virus\". The United Nations agency activated its incident-management system at the country, regional and global level and was standing ready to launch a broader response if it was needed. The WHO's regional office in Manila said in Twitter posts Saturday: \"#China has reported to WHO regarding a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, Hubei Province. The Govt has also met with our country office, and updated @WHO on the situation. Govt actions to control the incident have been instituted and investigations into the cause are ongoing.\"The Wuhan Institute of Virology did not respond to an emailed request for comment on the infectious source.\n\n\n=== 5 January ===\nThe number of suspected cases reached 59 with seven in a critical condition. All were quarantined and local medical officials commenced the monitoring of 163 of their contacts. At this time, there had been no reported cases of human-to-human transmission or presentations in healthcare workers.Department of Zoonoses (National Institute of Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention) submitted complete genome of Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (published 12-JAN-2020).Early investigations into the cause of the pneumonia ruled out seasonal flu, SARS, MERS and bird flu.\n\n\n=== 6 January ===\nOn Monday, 6 January, the Wuhan health authorities announced they continued seeking the cause but had so far ruled out influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus, and coronaviruses SARS and MERS as the respiratory pathogen that had infected 59 people as of 5 January.\n\n\n=== 7 January ===\nIn a closed meeting of the Central Politburo of the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping \"made requests for the prevention and control work of the coronavirus outbreak\" and issued instructions to similar ends. This meeting occurred 13 days before Xi's first public comments on the outbreak on 20 January.Scientists of the National Institute of Viral Disease Control and Prevention (IVDC) confirmed the novel coronavirus isolated on 3 January was the pathogenic cause of the viral pneumonia of unknown etiology (VPUE) cluster, and the disease has been designated novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP).Scientists in China announced the discovery of a new coronavirus.Since the outburst of social media discussion of the mysterious pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China, Chinese authorities censored the hashtag #WuhanSARS and were now investigating anyone who was allegedly spreading misleading information about the outbreak on social media.The world continued to wait for China to disclose more information about what had triggered an unexplained pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China's tenth-largest city.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) created an \u201cincident management system\u201d and issued a travel notice Monday for travelers to Wuhan, Hubei province, China due to the cluster of cases of pneumonia of an unknown etiology\u2026\"According to prof. Mikhail Shchelkanov (FEFU Scientists' Council on 17-MAR-2020) he knew sequence of the novel coronavirus genome by 7 January (\"we - world scientists' circles\").\n\n\n=== 8 January ===\nSouth Korea announced the first possible case of the virus coming from China. South Korea put a 36-year-old Chinese woman under isolated treatment amid concerns that she had brought back a form of viral pneumonia that had sickened dozens in mainland China and Hong Kong in the previous weeks. The unidentified woman, who worked for a South Korean company near capital Seoul, had experienced cough and fever since returning from a five-day trip to China on 30 December, the KCDC said in a press release. The woman had spent time in Wuhan, China, but had not visited the Huanan Seafood Market.\n\n\n=== 9 January ===\nThe WHO confirmed that the novel coronavirus had been isolated from one person who had been hospitalised. On the same day, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control posted its first risk assessment. The WHO also reported that Chinese authorities had acted swiftly, identifying the novel coronavirus within weeks of the onset of the outbreak, with the total number of positively tested people being 41. The first death from the virus occurred in a 61-year-old man who was a regular customer at the market. He had several significant medical conditions, including chronic liver disease, and died from heart failure and pneumonia. The incident was reported in China by the health commission via Chinese state media on 11 January.Chinese scientists reported on Chinese state broadcaster CCTV that they had found a new \"coronavirus in 15 of 57 patients with the illness in the central city of Wuhan, saying it has been preliminarily identified as the pathogen for the outbreak\". The scientists announced that the current 'Wuhan Virus', a coronavirus, appears to not be as lethal as SARS. They reported that the new viral outbreak was first detected in the city of Wuhan on 12 December 2019. Additionally, a total of 59 people have been identified as contracting the illness, seven patients had been in a critical condition at some stage, and no healthcare workers were reported as having been infected.\n\n\n=== 10 January ===\nThe gene sequencing data of the isolated 2019-nCoV, a virus from the same family as the SARS coronavirus, was posted on Virological.org by researchers from Fudan University, Shanghai. A further three sequences from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, one from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, and one from Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan were posted to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) portal. The same day, Public Health England issued its guidance.On 10 January 2020, Li Wenliang, Chinese ophthalmologist and coronavirus whistleblower, started having symptoms of a dry cough. On 12 January 2020, Wenliang started having a fever. He was admitted to the hospital on 14 January 2020. His parents also contracted the coronavirus (presumably from Wenliang) and were admitted to the hospital with him. Wenliang tested negative several times for the coronavirus until finally testing positive on 30 January 2020. He died on 7 February 2020.First two patients in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China attend University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital.\n\n\n=== 11 January ===\nThe first two patients in Shenzhen city transferred into a negative pressure room in Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen City due to matching lab test results, symptoms, and epidemiology and are being listed as suspected cases. The cases were not confirmed at the time, because requirement from the Chinese government at the time was that first case in each city needs to be submitted to provincial CDC, verified by national CDC, and then evaluated and confirmed by a specific diagnostic team in national CDC.The first viral genome sequence was shared to GENBANK and Virological.org by Professor Zhang Yongzhen of the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre through the auspices of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was before the government's official disclosure of the same to WHO, which occurred on the following day when the National Health Commission released several viral sequences to GISAID.\n\n\n=== 11\u201312 January ===\nIn China, more than 700 close contacts of the 41 confirmed cases, including more than 400 healthcare workers, had been monitored, with no new cases reported in China since 5 January. The WHO published initial guidance on travel advice, testing in the laboratory and medical investigation.\nWHO is saying that \"The [Chinese] government reports that there is no clear evidence that the virus passes easily from person to person\".\n\n\n=== 13 January ===\nThe USCDC announced that the genome had been posted on the NIH genetic sequence database, GenBank. On the same day, Thailand witnessed the first confirmed case of 2019-nCoV, the first outside China. The affected 61-year-old Chinese woman, who is a resident of Wuhan, had not visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, but was noted to have been to other markets. She had arrived in Bangkok on 8 January.\n\n\n=== 14 January ===\nWHO sent a tweet which said \"preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China\".  According to Reuters in Geneva, WHO said there may have been limited human-to-human transmission of a new coronavirus in China within families, and it is possible there could be a wider outbreak.On 14 January, The Wuhan Municipal Health Committee published a Q&A regarding the coronavirus, stating: \"current investigation hasn't found clear evidence of human to human transmission, however, the possibility of human to human transmission cannot be ruled out\".On 14 January, two of the 41 confirmed cases in Wuhan were reported to include a married couple, raising the possibility of human-to-human transmission.On 14 January, Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of WHO's emerging diseases unit said that there had been limited human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus, mainly small clusters in families, adding that \"it is very clear right now that we have no sustained human-to-human transmission\"In a confidential government teleconference on January 15, between Ma Xiaowei, the head of the National Health Commission and the provincial health authorities, the government internally acknowledged the threat of a pandemic due to the reporting of the Thailand viral infection a day earlier and the public health threat that New Year holiday travel presented for the further spread of the virus.\n\n\n=== 15 January ===\nA second death occurred in a 69-year-old man in China on 15 January.The first known travel-related case of 2019 novel coronavirus entered the United States: \"The patient from Washington with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection returned to the United States from Wuhan on January 15, 2020. The patient sought care at a medical facility in the state of Washington, where the patient was treated for the illness. Based on the patient\u2019s travel history and symptoms, healthcare professionals suspected this new coronavirus. A clinical specimen was collected and sent to CDC overnight, where laboratory testing yesterday confirmed the diagnosis via CDC\u2019s Real-time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) test.\"US Embassy in China issued a Health Alert Watch Level 1 for an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, preliminarily identified to be caused by a novel coronavirus.\n\n\n=== 16 January ===\nOn 16 January, the WHO was alerted by Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare that the first case in Japan, a 30-year-old male Chinese national had tested positive to 2019-nCoV during a hospital stay between 10 and 15 January. He had not visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, but possibly had close contact with an affected person in Wuhan.Researchers from the German Center for Infection Research (DZIF) at Charit\u00e9 \u2013 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin developed a new laboratory assay to detect the novel coronavirus. The assay protocol has been published by the WHO as a guideline for diagnostic detection for 2019-nCoV. The new assay enables suspected cases to be tested quickly.\n\n\n=== 17 January ===\nOn 17 January, Thailand's second confirmed case was reported in a 74-year-old woman who arrived in Bangkok on a flight from Wuhan.

This brought the number of laboratory-confirmed cases in China to 62. The patients' ages ranged from 30 to 79. 19 were discharged and eight remain critical.On the same day, the Wuhan City government held an annual banquet in the Baibuting community celebrating the Chinese New Year with forty thousand families in attendance despite the officials' knowledge of the spread of the novel coronavirus. They shared meals, plates and ate together. On 21 January 2020 when Wuhan mayor Zhou Xianwang was asked on state television why this banquet was held even after the number of cases had risen to 312 he responded, \"The reason why the Baibuting community continued to host the banquet this year was based on the previous judgment that the spread of the epidemic was limited between humans, so there was not enough warning.\"US HHS Secretary Alex Azar spoke to Trump on the phone about the virus, while which Trump interjected to ask when flavored vaping products would be back on the market.\n\n\n=== 19 January ===\nOn 19 January, the first confirmed cases were reported in China, outside Wuhan, one in the southern province of Guangdong and two in Beijing. Wuhan reported 136 additional laboratory-confirmed cases, bringing the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases in China to 201. A new death was also reported in Wuhan, bringing the total number of fatalities in China to three.\n\n\n=== 20 January ===\nOn 20 January, after two medical staff were infected in Guangdong, China National Health Commission confirmed that the virus was human-to-human transmissible. The investigation team from China's National Health Commission confirmed for the first time that the coronavirus can be transmitted between humans.Scientists from the China CDC identified three different strains of the 2019-nCoV confirming that the original Wuhan coronavirus had mutated into two additional strains.Chinese Communist Party general secretary (Paramount leader), Xi Jinping said \u201cpeople\u2019s lives and health should be given top priority and the spread of the outbreak should be resolutely curbed.\u201d State Council premier Li Keqiang urged decisive and effective efforts to prevent and control the epidemic. First confirmed case reported in South Korea. Beijing and Guangdong reported an additional three and thirteen laboratory-confirmed cases, respectively. Shanghai confirms its first case, bringing the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases in China to 218. At least two people had become infected whilst living hundreds of miles from Wuhan.The United States and South Korea each reported their first confirmed case of the coronavirus to the World Health Organization on Jan. 20. US CDC developed its own testing kit after China shared the genetic sequence on Jan. 10 and deployed it to detect the first coronavirus case. The testing kit used three small genetic sequences instead of two used by Germany. The test kits were found to be defective because the third sequence, or \u201cprobe,\u201d gave inconclusive results.Five attendees of an as-yet-unnamed private international sales company meeting of 109 attendees, 94 from overseas, held from 20\u201322 January at the Grand Hyatt Hotel, Singapore were diagnosed with the coronavirus upon returning home: one from Malaysia, two from South Korea and two from Singapore. One of the attendees was from Wuhan, China. It was reported that the company held a buffet for their delegates. These four diagnoses were not reported until 5 February 2020. The first laboratory-confirmed case in Singapore of an unrelated 67-year-old native of Wuhan was not reported until 23 January 2020. These cases linked to the meeting were the first evidence that the Wuhan coronavirus had spread through human-to-human contact outside China, which the WHO has said is deeply concerning and could signal evidence of a much larger outbreak. As of 5 February 2020, the sister of a Malaysian who attended the meeting had been infected and four more local staff in Singapore were confirmed as having virus symptoms.\n\n\n=== 21 January ===\nA total of 291 cases have now been reported across major cities in China, including Beijing and Shanghai. However, most patients are in Wuhan, the central city of 11 million at the heart of the outbreak.A report by the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London suggested there could be more than 1,700 infections. However, Gabriel Leung, the dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong, put the figure closer to 1,300.After 300 confirmed diagnoses and 6 deaths, Chinese state media warned lower-level officials not to cover up the spread of a new coronavirus. Officials declared that anyone who concealed new cases would \"be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity\", the political body responsible for law and order said. The outbreak has revived memories of the SARS virus when the local Chinese officials initially withheld information about the SARS epidemic from the public and later vastly under-reported the number of people that had been infected, downplayed the risks and failed to provide timely information that experts say could have saved lives. In its commentary published online on Tuesday, January 21, 2020, the Communist Party's Central Political and Legal Commission talked of China having learned a \"painful lesson\" from the SARS epidemic and called for the public to be kept informed.\nDeception, it warned, could \"turn a controllable natural disaster into a man-made disaster\".The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported at least 15 medical workers in Wuhan have also been infected with the virus, with one in a critical condition.WHO Situation Report 1: (Please note that the WHO Situation Reports as official reportage stand on their own.)\nConfirmed cases were reported in several new locations in China.

Guizhou, Fujian, Anhui, Shanxi and Ningxia reported one laboratory-confirmed case each. Hainan reported four laboratory-confirmed cases. Hunan reported three additional laboratory-confirmed cases. Guangxi reported two laboratory-confirmed cases. In all, the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases in China increased to 571 and the death toll to 17.Internationally, two more laboratory-confirmed cases were reported in Thailand, raising the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases in Thailand to four.New data showed indications of the current rapid spread of the disease and an increase in the rate of transmission.Officials announced a quarantine of the greater Wuhan, China area to commence on 23 January 2020 at 10:00 a.m. No traffic would be allowed in or out of the city.Zhou Xianwang, the mayor of Wuhan, admitted that his team had not released information about the virus in a \"timely\" manner, resulting in over 5 million people traveled out of the city before Wuhan was placed in quarantine. Zhou indicated that Wuhan needed authorization from above before they could make any announcement regarding the virus.US Embassy in China raised the Health Alert to level 2 (Practice Enhanced Precautions). President Trump during an interview at Economic Forum in Switzerland that \"It\u2019s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It\u2019s\u2014going to be just fine.\"\n\n\n=== 23 January ===\nWHO Situation Report 3:Jiangsu reported its first laboratory-confirmed case.

Vietnam confirmed its first two laboratory-confirmed cases, a 65 or 66-year-old father and 27 or 28-year-old son from China.A scientific preprint from the Wuhan institute of Virology is posted on Biorxiv (later published in Nature) announcing that a bat virus with 96% similarity had been sequenced in a Yunnan cave in 2013, whose sequence is posted the next day on public databases. It is  confirmed by comparing infectivity of cells expressing or not expressing ACE2 that the novel coronavirus uses this same entry receptor as SARS-CoV.Wuhan suspended all public transportation from 10 a.m. onwards, including all bus, metro and ferry lines. Additionally, all outbound trains and flights were halted. According to the Science magazine, the travel quarantine of Wuhan delayed the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days in Mainland China, but has a more marked effect at the international scale, where case importations were reduced by nearly 80% until mid February.\n\n\n=== 24 January ===\nA report by Chinese doctors and scientists published in The Lancet medical journal was titled \"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China\". It indicated that people can be symptom-free for several days while the coronavirus is incubating, increasing the risk of contagious infection without forewarning signs. According to their data, 13 of the initial 41 cases of the novel coronavirus had no link with the wet market in Wuhan purported to be the origin of the disease, and the evidence taken as a whole indicated human transmission. They strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers dealing with patients, stressed the need for testing for the virus, and because of its \"pandemic potential\" careful surveillance was essential. The significance of this was highlighted on 18 March by Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet.One of the earlier studies on person-to-person transmission was published by Hong Kong doctors in The Lancet titled \"A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster\". In the \"Evidence before this study\" it declared that \"we searched PubMed on Jan 13, 2020, with no starting date limitations, using the terms \u201cfamily\u201d, \u201cpneumonia\u201d, \u201cWuhan\u201d, \u201ccoronavirus\u201d, and \u201cnovel\u201d for articles in English. Our search did not reveal any reports of novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan before 2020. We only noted family clusters of pneumonia due to the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in 2003, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2012.\"WHO Situation Report 4:\n\nShandong reported six additional laboratory-confirmed cases. Hunan reported 15 additional laboratory-confirmed cases. Liaoning reported one additional laboratory-confirmed case. Fujian reported four additional laboratory-confirmed cases. Anhui reported six additional laboratory-confirmed cases. Ningxia reported one additional laboratory-confirmed case.

The lethality of the virus is unknown; however, the death toll has now climbed to above three percent.Wang Xianliang, a Hubei provincial government official, died of pneumonia caused by the virus.\n\n\n=== 27 January ===\nWHO Situation Report 7:Gabriel Leung, Dean of the University of Hong Kong medical school and one of the foremost world experts on SARS and viruses, gave a three-hour presentation published on YouTube wherein he made nowcasts and forecasts of the coronavirus. Using traditional scientific modeling techniques that predict the spread of viruses, Leung projected the true number of coronavirus infections was likely 10 time more than the official reported numbers. Leung estimated that there were between 44,000\u2013100,000 infections in China as of 24 January 2020. He stated that draconian measures were needed to slow the progress of the virus but that these measures would have no effect in stopping the coronavirus pandemic. He projected that the number of infections would continue exponentially peaking out in late April or May 2020. Leung predicted that at the peak of the pandemic, there could be up to 100,000 new infections per day. Leung subsequently published an article in The Lancet nowcasting and forecasting the likely progression of the Wuhan coronavirus taking into consideration numerous variables.\nZhou Xianwang, the mayor of Wuhan, said on a Chinese state television talkshow that rules imposed by Beijing limited what he could disclose about the threat posed by the Wuhan coronavirus as it unfolded, suggesting \"the central government was partially responsible for a lack of transparency that has marred the response to the fast-expanding health crisis.\"Canada reported its first confirmed case and another presumptive case.

        "wiki": "The Battle of Wuhan(\u6b66\u6c49\u4e4b\u6218), popularly known to the Chinese as the Defense of Wuhan, and to the Japanese as the Capture of Wuhan, was a large-scale battle of the Second Sino-Japanese War. Engagements took place across vast areas of Anhui, Henan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Hubei provinces over a period of four and a half months. This battle was the longest, largest and arguably the most significant battle in the early stages of the Second Sino-Japanese War. More than one million National Revolutionary Army troops from the Fifth and Ninth War Zone were put under the direct command of Chiang Kai-shek, defending Wuhan from the Central China Area Army of the Imperial Japanese Army led by Shunroku Hata. Chinese forces were also supported by Soviet Volunteer Group, a group of volunteer pilots from Soviet Air Forces.Although the battle ended with the eventual capture of Wuhan by the Japanese forces, it resulted in heavy casualties on both sides, as high as 1.2 million combined by some estimates. With the Japanese suffering their heaviest losses of the war, they decided to divert their attention to the north, prolonging the war until the attack on Pearl Harbor. The end of the battle signaled the beginning of a strategic stalemate in the war, shifting from large pitched battles to localised struggles.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn 7 July 1937, the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) launched a full-scale invasion of China following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. Both Beijing and Tianjin fell to the Japanese by July 30, exposing the rest of the North China Plain. To disrupt the invasion plans of the Japanese, the Nationalists decided to engage the Japanese in Shanghai, opening a second front. The fighting lasted from 13 August to 12 November, with the Chinese suffering major casualties including \"70 percent of Chiang Kai-shek's young officers\". After the fall of Shanghai, Nanjing, which was the capital of China, was threatened directly by the Japanese forces. The nationalists were thus forced to declare the capital as an open city while beginning the process of moving the capital to Chongqing.\nWith the fall of three major Chinese cities (Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai), there was a large number of refugees fleeing the fighting in addition to the government facilities and war supplies that needed to be transferred to Chongqing. Due to inadequacies in the transport systems, the government was unable to complete the transfer. Wuhan thus became the \"de facto wartime capital\" of the Republic of China, due to its strong industrial, economic and cultural foundations. Assistance from the Soviet Union provided additional military and technical resources, including the Soviet Volunteer Group.\nOn the Japanese side, the IJA forces were drained due to the large number and extent of military operations since the beginning of the invasion. Reinforcements were thus dispatched to boost forces in the area, but this placed a considerable strain on the Japanese peacetime economy. This caused then-Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe to reassemble his Cabinet in 1938 as well as to introduce the National Mobilization Law on 5 May that year, moving Japan into a wartime economic state.Although putting Japan's economy on a wartime footing slowed down the depletion of its treasury, the economic situation was not sustainable long-term, given the cost of maintaining a military that could deal with the Soviet Union in a border conflict. The Japanese government thus wished to force the Chinese into submission quickly in order to gather resources to move on with their decision over northward and southward expansion. For the Japanese commanders, it was decided that Chinese resistance should be put to an end at Wuhan.\n\n\n=== Importance of Wuhan ===\n\nWuhan, located halfway upstream of the Yangtze River, was the second largest city in China with a population of 1.5 million in late 1938. The Yangtze River and the Hanshui River divides the city into three regions, which include Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang. Wuchang was the political center, Hankou was the commercial district and Hanyang was the industrial area. After the completion of the Yuehan Railway, the importance of Wuhan as a major transportation hub in the interior of China was further established. It also served as an important transit point for foreign aid moving inland from the southern ports.\n\nAfter the Japanese capture of Nanjing, the bulk of Nationalist government agencies and military command headquarters were located in Wuhan despite the fact that the capital had been moved to Chongqing. Wuhan thus became the de facto wartime capital at the onset of the engagements in Wuhan. The Chinese war effort was thus focused on protecting Wuhan from being occupied by the Japanese. The Japanese government and the headquarters of the China Expeditionary Army expected Wuhan to fall along with the Chinese resistance \"within a month of two\".\n\n\n=== Preparations for the battle ===\nIn December 1937, the Military Affairs Commission was created to determine the battle plan for the defense of Wuhan. After the loss of Xuzhou, approximately 1.1 million men or 120 divisions of the National Revolutionary Army were redeployed. The commission decided to organize the defense around the Dabie Mountains, Poyang Lake, and the Yangtze River against the 200,000 Japanese, or 20 divisions of the Imperial Japanese Army. Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi of the Fifth War Zone were assigned to defend the north of the Yangtze, while Chen Cheng of the Ninth War Zone was tasked with defending the south. The First War Zone, located in the west of the Zhengzhou-Xinyang section of the Pinghan Railway, was given the task of stopping the Japanese forces coming from the North China Plain. Finally, Chinese troops in the Third War Zone, located between Wuhu, Anqing and Nanchang, were given the task to protect the Yuehan Railway.\n\nAfter the Japanese occupied Xuzhou in May 1938, they sought to actively expand the scale of the invasion. The IJA decided to send a vanguard to first occupy Anqing for use as a forward base for an attack on Wuhan, then for its main force to attack the area north of the Dabie Mountains moving along the Huai River, eventually occupying Wuhan by way of the Wusheng Pass. After that, another detachment would move west along the Yangtze. However, due to the Yellow River flood, the IJA was forced to abandon the plan of attacking along the Huai, and decided to attack along both banks of the Yangtze instead. On 4 May, the commander of the IJA forces, Shunroku Hata, organised approximately 350,000 men of the Second and Eleventh Armies for the fighting in and around Wuhan. Under him, Yasuji Okamura commanded five and a half divisions of the Eleventh Army along both banks of the Yangtze in the main assault on Wuhan while Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni commanded four and a half divisions of the Second Army along the northern foot of the Dabie Mountains to assist the assault. These forces were augmented by 120 ships of the Third Fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy under Koshir\u014d Oikawa, more than 500 planes of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service as well as five divisions of Japanese forces from the Central China Area Army to guard the areas in and around Shanghai, Beijing, Hangzhou, and other important cities, thus protecting the back of the Japanese forces and completing the preparation for the battle.\n\n\n== Prelude ==\n\nThe Battle of Wuhan was preceded by a Japanese air strike on 18 February 1938. It was known as the \"2.18 Air Battle\" and ended with Chinese forces repelling the attack. On 24 March, the Diet of Japan passed the National Mobilization Law that authorized unlimited war funding. As part of the law, the National Service Draft Ordinance also allowed the conscription of civilians. On 29 April, the Japanese air force launched major air strikes on Wuhan to celebrate Emperor Hirohito's birthday. The Chinese, with prior intelligence, were well prepared. This battle was known as the \"4.29 Air Battle\" and was one of the most intense air battles of the Second Sino-Japanese War.\n\nAfter the fall of Xuzhou in May 1938, the Japanese planned an extensive invasion of Hankou and the takeover of Wuhan, intending to destroy the main force of the National Revolutionary Army. The Chinese, on the other hand, were building up their defensive efforts by massing troops in the Wuhan area. They also set up an defensive line in Henan to delay the Japanese forces coming from Xuzhou. However, due to the disparity in Chinese and Japanese troop strength, this line of defense collapsed quickly.In an attempt to win more time for the preparation of the defense of Wuhan, the Chinese opened up the dikes of the Yellow River in Huayuankou, Zhengzhou on 9 June. The flood, now known as the 1938 Yellow River flood, forced the Japanese to delay their attack on Wuhan. However, it also caused around 500,000 to 900,000 civilian deaths, flooding many cities in the north of China.\n\n\n== Major engagements ==\n\n\n=== South of the Yangtze River ===\n\nOn 15 June, the Japanese made a naval landing and captured Anqing, signalling the onset of the Battle of Wuhan. On the southern bank of the Yangtze River, the Chinese Ninth War Zone had one regiment stationed west of Poyang Lake, and another regiment stationed in Jiujiang. On 24 June, the Japanese forces made a surprise landing in Madang, while the main force of the Japanese Eleventh Army attacked along southern shore of the Yangtze River. Madang quickly fell to the Japanese, which opened up the route to Jiujiang.The Chinese defenders tried to resist the Japanese advance, but they could not repel the landing force of the Japanese 106th Division from capturing Jiujiang on the 26th. The Japanese Namita detachment moved westward along the river, landing northeast of Ruichang on 10 August and mounting an assault on the city. The defending NRA 2nd Corps was reinforced by the 32nd Army Group and was initially able to halt the Japanese attack. However, when the Japanese 9th Division entered the fray, the Chinese defenders were exhausted, and Ruichang was captured on the 24th.\nThe Japanese 9th Division and the Namita detachment continued to move along the river, while the Japanese 27th Division invaded Ruoxi at the same time. The Chinese 30th and 18th Corps resisted along the Ruichang-Ruoxi Road and the surrounding area, resulting in a stalemate for more than a month until the Japanese 27th Division captured Ruoxi on 5 October. The Japanese forces then turned to strike northeast, capturing Xintanpu in Hubei on the 18th and then moving towards Dazhi.\nIn the meantime, other Japanese forces and the supporting river fleet continued their advance westwards along the Yangtze, encountering resistance from the defending Chinese 31st Army and 32nd Army Group west of Ruichang. When the town of Madang and Fujin Mountain, both in Yangxin County, were captured, the Chinese 2nd Corps deployed the 6th, 56th, 75th and 98th Armies along with the 30th Army Group to strengthen the defense of the Jiangxi region. The battle continued until 22 October when the Chinese lost other towns in Yangxin county, Dazhi and Hubei province. The Japanese 9th Division and Namita detachment were now approaching Wuchang.\n\n\n=== Wanjialing ===\n\nWhile the Japanese Army attacked Ruichang, the 106th Division moved along the Nanxun Railway (now known as Nanchang-Jiujiang) on the south side. The defending Chinese 4th Army, 8th Army Group, and 29th Army Group relied on the advantageous terrain of Lushan and north of Nanxun Railway to resist. As a result, the Japanese offensive suffered a setback. On 20 August, the Japanese 101st Division crossed the Poyang Lake from Hukou County to reinforce the 106th Division, breaching the Chinese 25th Army's defensive line and capturing Xinzhi. They then attempted to occupy De'an County and Nanchang together with the 106th Division to protect the southern flank of the Japanese Army which was advancing westward. Xue Yue, the commander-in-chief of the Chinese First Corps, used the 4th, 29th, 66th, and 74th Armies to link with the 25th Army and engage the Japanese in a fierce battle at Madang and north of De'an, bringing the battle to a stalemate.\nTowards the end of September, 4 regiments of the Japanese 106th Division circled into the Wanjialing region, west of De'an. Xue Yue commanded the Chinese 4th, 66th, and 77th Armies to flank the Japanese. The 27th Division of the Japanese Army attempted to reinforce the position but was ambushed and repulsed by the Chinese 32nd Army led by Shang Zhen in Baisui Street, west of Wanjialing. On 7 October, the Chinese Army mounted a final large-scale assault to encircle the Japanese troops. The fierce battle continued for three days, and all Japanese counter-attacks were repelled by the Chinese.\nBy 10 October, the Japanese 106th Division as well as the 9th, 27th, and 101st Divisions which had gone to reinforce the 106th had all suffered heavy casualties. The Aoki, Ikeda, Kijima, and Tsuda brigades were also annihilated in the encirclement. With Japanese forces in the area losing combat command capabilities, hundreds of officers were airdropped into the area. Of the four Japanese divisions which had gone into the battle, only around 1,500 men made it out of the encirclement. This was later called the Victory of Wanjialing by the Chinese.\nAfter the war, in the year 2000, Japanese military historians admitted the heavy damages that the 9th, 27th, 101st and 106th Divisions and their subordinate units had suffered during the Battle of Wanjialing, multiplying the number of war dead honoured in Japanese shrines. It was also said that the damages were not admitted during the war in order to maintain public morale and confidence in the war effort.\n\n\n=== North of the Yangtze River ===\nIn Shandong, 1,000 soldiers under Shi Yousan, who had defected multiple times to rivaling warlord cliques and was currently independent, occupied Jinan and held it for a few days. Guerrillas also held Yantai for a short period of time. The area east of Changzhou all the way to Shanghai was controlled by another non-government Chinese force led by Dai Li, employing guerrilla tactics in the suburbs of Shanghai and across the Huangpu River. This force was made up of secret society members of the Green Gang and the Tiandihui, killing spies and traitors. They lost more than 100 men during their operations. On 13 August, members of this force sneaked into the Japanese air base at Hongqiao, raising a Chinese flag.\n\nWhile these factions were active, the Japanese 6th Division breached the defensive lines of Chinese 31st and 68th Army on 24 July and captured Taihu, Susong, and Huangmei counties on 3 August. As the Japanese continued to move westward, the Chinese 4th Army of the Fifth War Zone deployed their main force in Guangji, Hubei and Tianjia Town to intercept the Japanese offensive. The 11th Army Group and the 68th Army were ordered to form a line of defense in Huangmei county, while the 21st and 29th Army Group, as well as the 26th Army, moved south to flank the Japanese.\nThe Chinese recaptured Taihu on 27 August and Susong on 28 August. However, with Japanese reinforcements arriving on 30 August, the Chinese 11th Army Group and the 68th Army were unsuccessful in their counteroffensives. They retreated to the Guangji region to continue to resist the Japanese forces along with the Chinese 26th, 55th, and 86th Armies. The Chinese 4th Army Group ordered the 21st and 29th Army Groups to flank the Japanese from northeast of Huangmei, but they were unable to stop the Japanese advance. Guangji was then captured on 6 September. On 8 September, Guangji was recovered by the Chinese 4th Corps but Wuxue was lost on that same day.\nThe Japanese Army then lay siege to Tianjia Town Fort. The Chinese 4th Corps sent the 2nd Army to reinforce the 87th Army, and the 26th, 48th, and 86th Armies to flank the Japanese. However, they were beaten back and suffered many casualties at the hands of the battle-hardened Japanese, who had greater firepower . The Tianjia Town Fort was captured on the 29th, and the Japanese continued to attack westwards. They captured Huangpo on 24 October and were now approaching Hankou.\n\n\n=== Dabie Mountains ===\nIn the north of the Dabie Mountains, the Chinese 3rd Army Group of the Fifth War Zone stationed the 19th and 51st Army Groups and the 77th Army in the Liuan and Huoshan regions in Anqing. The 71st Army was tasked with the defense of Fujin Mountain and Gushi County in Henan. The Chinese 2nd Group Army was stationed in Shangcheng, Henan and Macheng, Hubei. The Chinese 27th Army Group and the 59th Army was stationed in the Yellow River region, and the 17th Army was deployed in the Xinyang region to organise the defensive works.\nThe Japanese attacked in late August with the 2nd Army Group marching from Hefei on two different routes. The 13th Division, on the southern route, breached the Chinese 77th Army's defensive line and captured Huoshan, then turned towards Yejiaji. The nearby Chinese 71st Army and the 2nd Army Group made use of their existing positions to resist the Japanese onslaught, halting the Japanese 13th Division. The 16th Division was thus called in to reinforce the attack. On 16 September, the Japanese captured Shangcheng. The defenders retreated southwards out of the city, using their strategic strongholds in the Dabie Mountains to continue the resistance. On 24 October, the Japanese occupied Macheng.\nThe 10th Division was the main force in the northern route. They breached the Chinese 51st Army's defensive line and captured Liuan on 28 August. On 6 September, they captured Gushi and continued their advance westwards. The Chinese 27th Army Group and the 59th Army gathered in the Yellow River region to resist. After ten days of fierce fighting, the Japanese crossed the Yellow River on 19 September. On the 21st, the Japanese 10th Division defeated the Chinese 17th Group Army and 45th Army, capturing Lushan.\nThe 10th Division then continued to move westward, but met a Chinese counterattack east of Xinyang and was forced to withdraw back to Lushan. The Japanese 2nd Army Group ordered the 3rd Division to assist the 10th Division in taking Xinyang. On 6 October, the 3rd Division circled back to Xintang and captured the Liulin station of Pinghan Railway. On the 12th, the Japanese 2nd Army captured Xinyang and moved south of the Pinghan Railway to attack Wuhan together with the 11th Army.\n\n\n=== Fighting in Guangzhou ===\n\nDue to the continuing stalemate around Wuhan and the continued influx of foreign aid to Chinese forces from ports in the south, the IJA decided to deploy 3 reserve divisions to pressure the naval shipping lines. It was thus decided to occupy the Guangdong port by way of an amphibious landing. Because of the fighting in Wuhan, the bulk of Chinese forces in Guangzhou had been transferred away. As such, the pace of the occupation was much smoother than expected and Guangzhou fell to the Japanese on 21 October.The successive victories attained by the Japanese forces completed the encirclement of Wuhan. Since the loss of the Guangzhou area meant that no more foreign aid would be flowing in, the strategic value of Wuhan was lost. The Chinese Army, hoping to save their remaining forces, thus abandoned the city on 25 October. The Japanese Army captured Wuchang and Hankou on 26 October and captured Hanyang on the 27th, concluding the campaign in Wuhan.\n\n\n== Use of chemical weapons ==\nAccording to Yoshiaki Yoshimi and Seiya Matsuno, Emperor Sh\u014dwa authorized, by specific orders (rinsanmei), the use of chemical weapons against the Chinese. During the battle of Wuhan, Prince Kan'in transmitted the emperor's orders to use toxic gas 375 times, from August to October, 1938, despite the 1899 Hague Declaration IV, 2 - Declaration on the Use of Projectiles the Object of Which is the Diffusion of Asphyxiating or Deleterious Gases, Article 23 (a) of the 1907 Hague Convention IV - The Laws and Customs of War on Land, and Article 171 of the Versailles Peace Treaty. According to another memo discovered by historian Yoshiaki Yoshimi, Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni authorized the use of poison gas against the Chinese on 16 August 1938. A resolution adopted by the League of Nations on 14 May condemned the use of toxic gas by the Imperial Japanese Army.Japan made heavy use of chemical weapons against China to make up for lack of numbers in combat and because China did not have any poison gas stockpiles of its own to retaliate. Japan used poison gas at Hankow in the Battle of Wuhan to break fierce Chinese resistance after conventional Japanese assaults were repelled by Chinese defenders. Rana Mitter wrote Under General Xue Yue, some 100,000 Chinese troops pushed back Japanese forces at Huangmei. At the fortress of Tianjiazhen, thousands of men fought until the end of September, with Japanese victory assured only with the use of poison gas. Yet even now, top Chinese generals seemed unable to work with each other At Xinyang, Li Zongren's Guangxi troops were battered to exhaustion. They expected that the troops of Hu Zongnan, another general close to Chiang Kai-shek, would relieve them, but instead Hu led his troops away from the city. Japan also used poison gas against Chinese Muslim armies at the Battle of Wuyuan and Battle of West Suiyuan.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAfter four months of intense fighting, both the Chinese Air Force and the Navy were decimated as the IJA had successfully captured Wuhan. However, the main Chinese land force remained largely intact, while the IJA was significantly weakened. The battle of Wuhan bought more time for Chinese forces and equipment in Central China to move further inland to Chongqing, laying the foundation for an extended war of resistance. After the capture of Wuhan, the IJA advance in central China was slowed down significantly by multiple battles around Changsha in 1939, 1941, and 1942. No more major offensives were launched until Operation Ichi-Go in 1944, with limited offensives mounted for the sole purpose of training recruits. The Chinese managed to preserve their strength to continue resisting the weakened IJA, reducing its capability to respond to rising tensions between Japan and the Soviet Union at the borders in the Northeast.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===",

        "wiki": "Jingmen (simplified Chinese: \u8346\u95e8; traditional Chinese: \u8346\u9580; pinyin: J\u012bngm\u00e9n; Wade\u2013Giles: Ching1m\u00ean2) is a prefecture-level city in central Hubei province, People's Republic of China. Jingmen is within an area where cotton and oil crops are planted. The population of the prefecture is 2,873,687 (2010 population census). The urban area of Jingmen City has a population of about 400,000. Jingmen is so named as in ancient times it was the gateway to Jingzhou, one of the Nine Provinces and means literally Gateway to Jingzhou.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nJingmen municipality comprises two districts, two county-level cities, one county and three other non MoCA management areas:\nDongbao District (\u4e1c\u5b9d\u533a)\nDuodao District  (\u6387\u5200\u533a)\nZhongxiang city (\u949f\u7965\u5e02)\nJingshan city (\u4eac\u5c71\u5e02)\nShayang County (\u6c99\u6d0b\u53bf)\nJingmen Advanced Technology Area (\u8346\u95e8\u9ad8\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u4ea7\u4e1a\u56ed\u533a or \u8346\u95e8\u9ad8\u65b0\u533a)\nZhanghe New Area (\u6f33\u6cb3\u65b0\u533a)\nQujialing Management District (\u5c48\u5bb6\u5cad\u7ba1\u7406\u533a)\n\n\n== City layout ==\nDongbao District \"downtown\" is located about 3 hours away from Wuhan by bus or rail. A new train service was introduced from Jingmen to Wuhan in 2004. Jingmen is very close to many great tourist attractions such as Changban Slope of Three Kingdoms fame, the Wudang Mountains, and the Ming Tomb in Zhongxiang (a World Heritage site only an hour away).  As it is located in central China, Jingmen is within easy reach of almost anywhere in the country, taking about 18 hours to either Beijing or Guangzhou by train, or two hours by train to Yichang, home of the Gezhouba Dam project and Three Gorges Dam. From here travellers can fly to many destinations.\nThe Dongbao District \"downtown\" has 3 north-south parallel roads:\n\nXiangshan Dadao - The main avenue of Jingmen City. Most governmental buildings are here. Most civil functions, including hospitals, recreational areas, hotels, and the only university in Jingmen - Jingchu University of Technology, are alongside the road.\nChangning Dadao - All big telecommunication companies set up there branches here. Also there are many cellphone shops. The Jingmen railway station is to the north of Changning Dadao.\nBaiyun Dadao - The inner city part of National Highway 207, and a route to the Xiangfan-Jingzhou Highway.\nJinxia Lu - Not a main avenue, but an important street in the city centre. Lots of small shops and schools there.Crisscrossing these three roads are the roads Xiangshan 1st to 3rd, so by using these main arteries it is possible to go almost anywhere in Jingmen. Xiangshan 3 road leads behind the Jingmen Foreign Language school and doesn't actually provide a direct link from Xiangshan Dadao to Changning Dadao.\nThe main commercial area is Zhongtian Street (formerly Jiefang (Liberty) Road), a pedestrian only street, which also crisscrosses the three main roads.\nJingmen is surrounded by hills within easy reach.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nJingmen has a typical humid subtropical climate, with January the coldest month and July the hottest month. The temperature goes up to 38 \u00b0C at noon with uncomfortable humidity in July, but also goes below 0 \u00b0C in winter, with snow every year. Rainfall is high in April to September, with less in autumn and winter.\nThe first member of the Jingmenvirus group was described in 2014 and named the Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) because it was isolated from a tick sampled in Jingmen.\n\n\n== Education ==\nJingchu University of Technology (Chinese: \u8346\u695a\u7406\u5de5\u5b66\u9662, JUT), Formerly Jingmen University) founded in early 2007, is the only university in the city of Jingmen. JUT has undergraduate programs on engineering, art, science, management, and nursing. Jingchu University of Technology is a public undergraduate institute approved by China's Ministry of Education. It is located in Jingmen, Hubei, a famous historical and cultural city known as the \u201cGate of Jingchu\u201d. It covers a land area of 147.71 hectares, with a school-building construction area of 300 thousands square meters. It is equipped with different modern teaching and scientific instruments .\nNotable high schools include Longquan High School, No.1 High School of Jingmen City and Dongbao High School. Longquan High School has a good reputation within Hubei province. Notable middle schools include the private Foreign Language School of Jingmen City, Haihui Middle School and Xiangshan Middle School. Notable primary schools include Jingmen Experimental Primary School, Red Flag Primary School of Jingmen City and Daqiao (Rail Bridge) Primary School.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nTwo expressways go through Jingmen, the Wuhan-Jingmen-Yichang Expressway (part of G42 Shanghai-Chengdu Expressway) and the Xiangyang-Jingmen-Jingzhou Expressway (part of G55 Erenhot-Guangzhou Expressway). The Wuhan-Jingmen section has been completed by 2010. The completion halves traveling time between Wuhan and Jingmen to 2 hours. China National Highway 207 also passes through Jingmen City.\nJingmen is served by the Jiaozuo-Liuzhou Railway and the local Jingmen-Shashi Railway and Changjiangbu-Jingmen Railways. Traveling to Jingmen by railway is convenient, though takes time.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe economy in Jingmen consists mainly of agriculture and industry. The service sector is not as developed as manufacturing.\nJingmen is an important area for rice, cotton, and rapeseed production. An annual event in late March, Jingmen Rape Petal Tourism Festival, exhibits local agricultural production.\nThe largest industry in Jingmen is petroleum refining. The Jingmen Branch of Sinopec is a main producer of oil products in central China, refining crude oil extracted from Nanyang Oilfield in Henan province and the Jianghan Oilfield in Hubei province.\nJingmen is a developing logistic hub in central China. Li Ning has set up its largest distribution center in Jingmen, to link southeastern production and consumption from all over China.\nOther important industries include power generation, production of agricultural chemicals and cement, metal and electronic waste recycling, and beer-making.\nOn July 30, 2014 the mayor of Jingmen, Xiao Juhua, signed a Sister City agreement with the rural Canadian township of North Glengarry in Eastern Ontario.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Wuhan University of Technology (WUT or WHUT), located in Wuchang District and Luonan Subdistrict, Hongshan District in Wuhan, Hubei, was merged on May 27, 2000, from three universities: Wuhan University of Technology (established in 1948), Wuhan Transportation University (established in 1946) and Wuhan Automotive Polytechnic University (established in 1958). WUT is one of the leading Chinese universities accredited by the Ministry of Education and one of the universities constructed in priority by the \"State Project 211\" for Chinese higher education institutions. It is also a Chinese Ministry of Education Double First Class Discipline University, with Double First Class status in certain disciplines.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nWuhan University of Technology (WUT) was founded on May 27, 2000 from the former Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan Transportation University and Wuhan Automotive Polytechnic University. Each of these three universities has its own uniquely important history.\nThe former Wuhan University of Technology dated back from three colleges, namely, Zhongnan Construction Engineering College in 1952, Shenyang Building Materials Industry College in 1958 and Beijing Institute of Building Engineering in 1958. Then in 1971, Beijing Institute of Building Engineering merged with Wuhan Construction Engineering School and thus formed Hubei Construction Industry College. Later in 1978, the college was awarded the title as national key university and then changed its name to Wuhan Institute of Building Materials. In 1985, the college changed its name to Wuhan University of Technology, which later passed the evaluation of \"State 211 Project\" in 1996 and entered into the direct administration of the Ministry of Education in 1998 before its merge with the other two universities in May 2000.\nThe former Wuhan Transportation University mainly originated from National Maritime Vocational School in 1946. Then in 1949, the college changed its name to Wuhan Transportation College. in 1952, the college changed its name to Wuhan River Transportation College. Later in 1957, the college changed its name to Wuhan University of  Water Transportation Engineering which then received the discipline adjustment by the Ministry of Transportation in 1963. More importantly, the college merged with Wuhan River Transportation School and thus got its name as Wuhan University of  Water Transportation Engineering. Later in 1993, the college was officially named as Wuhan Transportation University by the Ministry of Transportation before its merge with the other two universities in May 2000.\nThe former Wuhan Automotive Polytechnic University came from the original Wuhan Institute of Technology which was founded in 1958. In 1959, it was merged into Hubei Chemical Engineering College. Then in 1961, the college merged with the other two colleges, respectively, Wuhan Institute of Technology and Hubei Industry College and thus named itself Wuhan Institute of Technology. During the next fifteen years, the Institute underwent great changes and was forced to change its name due to China's Cultural Revolution. Then in 1979, the Institute regained its name as Wuhan Institute of Technology. Later from 1983 to 1994, the Institute showed its rapid development in many aspects. Then in 1995, the Institute changed its name to Wuhan Automotive Polytechnic University. What was more, in 1999, Hubei No.1 Mechanical Industry School and Hubei Energy Economy School were merged into the university. Later in May 2000, it merged with the other two universities mentioned in the beginning and thus formed Wuhan University of Technology.\n\n\n== Academic ==\nCurrently, the university owns 23 academic schools, 9 state key disciplines, 74 Doctoral programs, 135 Master's programs as well as 82 Bachelor's programs. WUT has about 5,570 staff members, including 650 professors, 3 academicians of China Academy of Engineering and 3 academicians of China Academy of Science.

        "wiki": "This is a list of the nationally-designated protected areas of China.  There are many forms of protected areas in China. Based on their relative importance, each type of protected area can be further graded into two to three levels (national, provincial and prefectural/county level).  Nevertheless, the highest rank for \"pocket nature preserve\" (social and mass-based), \"no-hunting area\", \"no-fishing area\", \"no-logging area\", \"wild medicinal material resources conservation area\", \"crop germplasm resources conservation area\", \"forest tree germplasm resources conservation area\" or \"source water protection area\" is practically restricted to provincial level.  The local government at county level is also responsible for the delimitation and declaration of \"basic farmland protection area\" and \"basic grassland\".  Qinling National Botanical Garden, said to be the world's largest (639 km2, of which 575.31 km2 being set aside for in-situ conservation purposes), was opened (Phase 1) to the public on September 27, 2017. \nTake note that many protected areas in China have multiple official designations, and the statutory boundaries of these multi-designated PAs may be identical or may vary one from the other.  For instance, the boundaries of Huangshan NP coincide with those of the Huangshan NGP, whereas Fujian province's Wuyi Mountains NNR, NP and NFP are adjacent to each other.  In Heilongjiang, 27,642.14 hectares out of 115,340.27 hectares of Huzhong NFP are intersected with the experiment zone of Huzhong NNR.  \n\n\n== National Park System Pilot Program ==\nNortheast China Tiger and Leopard National Park System Pilot Site, coverage:\nHunchun Northeast China Tiger NNR, Jilin\nWangqing NNR, Jilin\nMuling Japanese Yew NNR, Heilongjiang\nLaoyeling Northeast China Tiger NNR, Heilongjiang\nLanjia Daxiagu NFP, Jilin\nLiufengshan NFP, Heilongjiang\nWangqing Gayahe NWP, Jilin\nMijianghe Chum Salmon NAGRCA, Jilin\nZhejiang Qianjiangyuan National Park System Pilot Site, coverage:\nGutianshan NNR\nQianjiangyuan NFP\nFujian Wuyishan National Park Pilot Site, coverage:\nWuyishan NNR\nWuyishan NSHA\nWuyishan NFP\nWuyi Tianchi NFP\nJiuquxi Spinibarbus hollandi NAGRCA\nHubei Shennongjia National Park System Pilot Site, coverage:\nShennongjia NNR\nShennongjia NGP\nShennongjia NFP\nShennongjia Dajiuhu NWP\nHunan Nanshan National Park System Pilot Site, coverage:\nJintongshan NNR\nNanshan NSHA\nLiangjiang Xiagu NFP\nChengbu Baiyunhu NWP\nHainan Tropical Rainforest National Park Pilot Site, coverage:\nBawangling NNR\nJianfengling NNR\nWuzhishan NNR\nDiaoluoshan NNR\nYinggeling NNR\nJianfengling NFP\nDiaoluoshan NFP\nLimushan NFP\nBawangling NFP\nGiant Panda National Park System Pilot Site, coverage:\nWolong NNR, Sichuan\nFengtongzhai NNR, Sichuan\nTangjiahe NNR, Sichuan\nLongxi -

        "wiki": "Wuhan (simplified Chinese: \u6b66\u6c49; traditional Chinese: \u6b66\u6f22, [\u00f9.x\u00e2n] (listen)) is the capital city of Hubei Province in the People's Republic of China. It is the largest city in Hubei and the most populous city in Central China, with a population of over 11 million, the ninth most populous Chinese city and one of the nine National Central Cities of China.The name \"Wuhan\" came from the city's historical origin from the conglomeration of Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang, which are collectively known as the \"Three Towns of Wuhan\" (\u6b66\u6c49\u4e09\u9547).  It lies in the eastern Jianghan Plain, at the confluence of the Yangtze river and its largest tributary, the Han River and is known as \"Nine Provinces' Thoroughfare\" (\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862).Wuhan is considered by some to be one of the potential sites of the pivotal Battle of the Red Cliffs, which stopped warlord Cao Cao's incursion into southern China at the end of the Eastern Han dynasty. Other historical events taking place in Wuhan include the Wuchang Uprising of 1911, which led to the downfall of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China. Wuhan was briefly the capital of China in 1927 under the left wing of the Kuomintang (KMT) government led by Wang Jingwei. The city later served as the wartime capital of China for ten months in 1937 during the Second Sino-Japanese War. A novel coronavirus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic was first identified in Wuhan in December 2019.Wuhan is considered the political, economic, financial, commercial, cultural and educational center of Central China. It is a major transportation hub, with dozens of railways, roads and expressways passing through the city and connecting to other major cities. Because of its key role in domestic transportation, Wuhan is sometimes referred to as \"the Chicago of China\" by foreign sources. The \"Golden Waterway\" of the Yangtze River and the Han River traverse the urban area and divide Wuhan into the three districts of Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge crosses the Yangtze in the city. The Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest power station in terms of installed capacity, is located nearby. Historically, Wuhan has suffered risks of flooding, prompting the government to alleviate the situation by introducing ecologically friendly absorption mechanisms.While Wuhan has been a traditional manufacturing hub for decades, it is also one of the areas promoting modern industrial changes in China. Wuhan consists of three national development zones, four scientific and technological development parks, over 350 research institutes, 1,656 high tech enterprises, numerous enterprise incubators and investments from 230 Fortune Global 500 firms. It produced GDP of US$22.4 billion in 2018. The Dongfeng Motor Corporation, an automobile manufacturer, is headquartered in Wuhan. The city is home to multiple notable institutes of higher education, including Wuhan University and the Huazhong University of Science and Technology. In 2017, Wuhan was designated as a Creative City by UNESCO, in the field of design. Wuhan is classified as a Beta world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Wuhan\" is a portmanteau of the two major cities on the northern and southern banks of the Yangtze River that make up the Wuhan metropolis: \"Wu\" refers to the city of Wuchang (Chinese: \u6b66\u660c), which lies on the southern bank of the Yangtze, while \"Han\" refers to the city of Hankou (Chinese: \u6c49\u53e3), which lies on the northern bank of the Yangtze.\nIn 1926, the Northern Expedition reached the Wuhan area and it was decided to merge Hankou, Wuchang and Hanyang into one city in order to make a new capital for Nationalist China. On January 1, 1927, the resulting city was proclaimed as '\u6b66\u6f22' (the traditional Chinese characters for 'Wuhan'), which was later simplified as '\u6b66\u6c49' (also 'Wuhan').\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nThe Wuhan area has been settled for 3,500 years. Panlongcheng, an archaeological site primarily associated with the Erligang culture (c. 1510 \u2013 c. 1460 BC) (being sparsely populated during the earlier Erlitou period), is located in modern-day Huangpi District.\nDuring the Western Zhou the State of E, which gives its name to the single character abbreviation for Hubei province, controlled the present-day Wuchang area south of the Yangtze River. After the conquest of the E state in 863 BC, the present-day Wuhan area was controlled by the State of Chu for the rest of the Western Zhou and Eastern Zhou periods.  Chu was in turn conquered by Qin in 223 BCE.\n\n\n=== Imperial China ===\n\nDuring the Han dynasty, Hanyang became a fairly busy port. The Battle of Xiakou in AD 203 and Battle of Jiangxia five years later were fought over control of Jiangxia Commandery (present-day Xinzhou District in northeast Wuhan). In the winter of 208/9, one of the most famous battles in Chinese history and a central event in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms\u2014the Battle of Red Cliffs\u2014took place near the Yangtze River, with the cliffs near Wuhan identified as one of the potential locations. Around that time, walls were built to protect Hanyang (AD 206) and Wuchang (AD 223). The latter event marks the foundation of Wuhan. In AD 223, the Yellow Crane Tower, one of the Four Great Towers of China, was constructed on the Wuchang side of the Yangtze River by order of Sun Quan, leader of the Eastern Wu. The tower become a sacred site of Taoism.Due to tensions between the Eastern Wu and Cao Wei kingdoms, in the autumn of 228, Cao Rui, grandson of Cao Cao and the second emperor of the state of Cao Wei, ordered the general Man Chong to lead troops to Xiakou (\u590f\u53e3; in present-day Wuhan). In 279, Wang Jun and his army conquered strategic locations in Wu territory such as Xiling (in present-day Yichang, Hubei), Xiakou (\u590f\u53e3; present-day Hankou) and Wuchang (\u6b66\u660c; present-day Ezhou, Hubei).\nDuring the Northern and Southern dynasties period, the Wuhan area was part of the successive Southern dynasty states Liu Song (420\u2013479), Southern Qi (479\u2013502), Liang, and Western Liang.\nIn fall 550, Hou Jing sent Ren Yue to attack both Xiao Daxin and Xiao Fan's son Xiao Si (\u856d\u55e3).  Ren killed Xiao Si in battle, and Xiao Daxin, unable to resist, surrendered, allowing Hou to take his domain under control.  Meanwhile, Xiao Guan, who had by now settled at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan), was planning to attack Hou, but this drew Xiao Yi's ire\u2014believing that Xiao Guan was intending to contend for the throne\u2014and he sent Wang to attack Xiao Guan. In summer 567, Chen Xu commissioned Wu Mingche as the governor of Xiang Province and had him command a major part of the troops against Hua, along with Chunyu Liang (\u6df3\u4e8e\u91cf). The opposing sides met at Zhuankou (\u6c8c\u53e3, in modern Wuhan).\nThe city has long been renowned as a center for the arts (especially poetry) and for intellectual studies. Cui Hao, a celebrated poet of the Tang dynasty, visited the Yellow Crane Tower in the early 8th century; his poem made it the most celebrated building in southern China.In spring 877, Wang Xianzhi captured E Prefecture (\u9102\u5dde, in modern Wuhan).  He then returned north, joining forces with Huang again, and they surrounded Song Wei at Song Prefecture (\u5b8b\u5dde, in modern Shangqiu, Henan).  In winter 877, Huang Chao pillaged Qi and Huang (\u9ec3\u5dde, in modern Wuhan) Prefectures.\nBefore Kublai Khan arrived in 1259, word reached him that M\u00f6ngke had died. Kublai decided to keep the death of his brother secret and continued the attack on the Wuhan area, near the Yangtze. The present-day Wuying Pagoda was constructed at the end of the Song Dynasty between attacks by the Mongolian forces.  Under the Mongol rulers (Yuan dynasty) (after 1301), the Wuchang prefecture, headquartered in the town, became the capital of Hubei province. Hankou, from the Ming to late Qing, was under the administration of the local government in Hanyang, although it was already one of the four major national markets (zh:\u56db\u5927\u540d\u9547) of the Ming dynasty.\nHanyang's Guiyuan Temple was completed in the 15th year of Shunzhi (1658).By the dawn of the 18th century, Hankou had become one of China's top four most important towns of trade. In the late 19th century, railroads were extended on a north\u2013south axis through the city, making Wuhan an important transshipment point between rail and river traffic. Also during this period foreign powers extracted mercantile concessions, with the riverfront of Hankou being divided up into foreign-controlled merchant districts. These districts contained trading firm offices, warehouses, and docking facilities. The French had a concession in Hankou. During the Taiping Rebellion, the Wuhan area was controlled for many years by rebel forces and the Yellow Crane Tower, Xingfu Temple, Zhuodaoquan Temple and other buildings were repurposed or damaged. During the Second Opium War (known in the West as the Arrow War, 1856\u20131860), the government of the Qing dynasty was defeated by the western powers and signed the Treaties of Tianjin and the Convention of Peking, which stipulated eleven cities or regions (including Hankou) as trading ports. In December 1858, James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, High Commissioner to China, led four warships up the Yangtze River in Wuhan to collect the information needed for opening the trading port in Wuhan.\nIn the spring of 1861, Counselor Harry Parkes and Admiral Herbert were sent to Wuhan to open a trading port. On the basis of the Convention of Peking, Harry Parkes concluded the Hankou Lend-Lease Treaty with Guan Wen, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei. It brought an area of 30.53 square kilometers (11.79 sq mi) along the Yangtze River (from latter-day Jianghan Road to Hezuo Road) to become a British Concession and permitted Britain to set up its consulate in the concession.\n\nIn 1889, Zhang Zhidong was transferred from Viceroy of Liangguang (Guangdong and Guangxi provinces) to Viceroy of Huguang (Hunan and Hubei provinces). He governed the province for 18 years, until 1907. During this period, he elucidated the theory of \"Chinese learning as the basis, Western learning for application,\" known as the ti-yong ideal. He set up many heavy industries, founded Hanyang Steel Plant, Daye Iron Mine, Pingxiang Coal Mine and Hubei Arsenal and set up local textile industries, boosting the flourishing modern industry in Wuhan. Meanwhile, he initiated education reform, opened dozens of modern educational organizations successively, such as Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) Academy of Classical Learning, Civil General Institute, Military General Institute, Foreign Languages Institute and Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) General Normal School, and selected a great many students for study overseas, which well promoted the development of China's modern education. Furthermore, he trained a modern military and organized a modern army including a zhen and a xie (both zhen and xie are military units in the Qing dynasty) in Hubei.\nOriginally known as the Hubei Arsenal, the Hanyang Arsenal was founded in 1891 by Qing official Zhang Zhidong, who diverted funds from the Nanyang Fleet in Guangdong to build the arsenal. It cost about 250,000 pounds sterling and was built in 4 years. On 23 April 1894, construction was completed and the arsenal, occupying some 40 acres (160,000 m2), could start production of small-caliber cannons. It built magazine-fed rifles, Gruson quick fire guns, and cartridges.\n\n\n==== Wuchang Uprising ====\n\nBy 1900, according to Collier's magazine, Hankau, the Yangtze River boom town, was \"the St. Louis and Chicago of China.\" On October 10, 1911, Sun Yat-sen's followers launched the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the collapse of the Qing dynasty, as well as the establishment of the Chinese Republic.The Wuchang Uprising of October 1911, which overthrew the Qing dynasty, originated in Wuhan. Before the uprising, anti-Qing secret societies were active in Wuhan. In September 1911, the outbreak of the protests in Sichuan forced the Qing authorities to send part of the New Army garrisoned in Wuhan to suppress the rebellion. On September 14 the Literary Society (\u6587\u5b78\u793e) and the Progressive Association (\u5171\u9032\u6703), two local revolutionary organizations in Hubei, set up joint headquarters in Wuchang and planned for an uprising. On the morning of October 9, a bomb at the office of the political arrangement exploded prematurely and alerted local authorities. The proclamation for the uprising, beadroll and the revolutionaries\u2019 official seal fell into the hands of Rui Cheng, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei, who demolished the uprising headquarters the same day and set out to arrest the revolutionaries listed in the beadroll. This forced the revolutionaries to launch the uprising earlier than planned.On the night of October 10, the revolutionaries fired shots to signal the uprising at the engineering barracks of Hubei New Army. They then led the New Army of all barracks to join the revolution. Under the guidance of Wu Zhaolin, Cai Jimin and others, this revolutionary army seized the official residence of the governor and government offices. Rui Cheng fled in panic into the Chuyu ship. Zhang Biao, the commander of the Qing army, also fled the city. On the morning of the 11th, the revolutionary army took the whole city of Wuchang, but leaders such as Jiang Yiwu and Sun Wu disappeared. Thus the leaderless revolutionary army recommended Li Yuanhong, the assistant governor of the Qing army, as the commander-in-chief. Li founded the Hubei Military Government, proclaimed the abolition of the Qing rule in Hubei, the founding of the Republic of China and published an open telegram calling for other provinces to join the revolution.As the revolution spread to other parts of the country, the Qing government concentrated loyalist military forces to suppress the uprising in Wuhan. From October 17 to December 1, the revolutionary army and local volunteers defended the city in the Battle of Yangxia against better armed and more numerous Qing forces commanded by Yuan Shikai. Huang Xing would arrive in Wuhan in early November to take command of the revolutionary army. After fierce fighting and heavy casualties, Qing forces seized Hankou and Hanyang. But Yuan agreed to halt the advance on Wuchang and participated in peace talks, which would eventually lead to the return of Sun Yat-sen from exile, founding of the Republic of China on January 1, 1912. Through the Wuchang Uprising, Wuhan is known as the birthplace of the Xinhai Revolution, named after the Xinhai year on the Chinese calendar. The city has several museums and memorials to the revolution and the thousands of martyrs who died defending the revolution.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\n\nWith the northern extension of the Northern Expedition, the center of the Great Revolution shifted from the Pearl River basin to the Yangtze River basin. On November 26, the Kuomintang Central Political Committee decided to move the capital from Guangzhou to Wuhan. In mid-December, most of the KMT central executive commissioners and national government commissioners arrived in Wuhan, set up the temporary joint conference of central executive commissioners and National Government commissioners, performed the top functions of central party headquarters and National Government, declared they would work in Wuhan on January 1, 1927, and decided to combine the towns of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang into Wuhan City, called \"Capital District\". The new national government, later known as \"Wuhan nationalist government\", was based in the Nanyang Building in Hankou, while the central party headquarters and other organizations chose their locations in Hankou or Wuchang.In March 1927, Mao Zedong appeared at the Third Plenum of the KMT Central Executive Committee in Wuhan, which sought to strip General Chiang of his power by appointing Wang Jingwei leader. The first phase of the Northern Expedition was interrupted by the political split in the Kuomintang following the formation of the Nanjing faction in April 1927 against the existing faction in Wuhan. Members of the Chinese Communist Party, who had survived the April 12 massacre, met at Wuhan and reelected Chen Duxiu (Ch'en Tu-hsiu) as the Party's Secretary General. The split was partially motivated by the purge of the Communists within the party, which marked the end of the First United Front, and Chiang Kai-shek briefly stepped down as the commander of the National Revolutionary Army.In June 1927, Stalin sent a telegram to the Communists in Wuhan, calling for the mobilization of an army of workers and peasants. This alarmed Wang Jingwei, who decided to break with the Communists and come to terms with Chiang Kai-shek. The Wuhan coup was a political shift made on July 15, 1927, by Wang Jingwei towards Chiang Kai-shek, and his Shanghai-based rival in the Kuomintang. The Wuhan Nationalist Government was established in Wuhan on February 21, 1927, and ended by August 19, 1927. After the end of the Northern Expedition, Hankou was elevated to a centrally-controlled municipality.\n\nIn the 1931 China floods, one of the deadliest flood disasters in world history, Wuhan was a refuge for flood victims from outlying areas, who had been arriving since the late spring. But when the city itself was inundated in the early summer, and after a catastrophic dike failure just before 6:00 AM on July 27, an estimated 782,189 urban citizens and rural refugees were left homeless. The flood covered an area of 32 square miles and the city was flooded under many feet of water for close to three months. Large numbers gathered on flood islands throughout the city, with 30,000 sheltering on a railway embankment in central Hankou. With little food and a complete breakdown in sanitation, thousands soon began to succumb to diseases. Jin Shilong, Senior Engineer at the Hubei Flood Prevention Agency, described the flooding:There was no warning, only a sudden great wall of water. Most of Wuhan's buildings in those days were only one story high, and for many people there was no escape- they died by the tens of thousands. ... I was just coming off duty at the company's main office, a fairly new three-story building near the center of town ... When I heard the terrible noise and saw the wall of water coming, I raced to the top story of the building. ... I was in one of the tallest and strongest buildings left standing. At that time no one knew whether the water would subside or rise even higher.The high-water mark was reached on 19 August at Hankou, with the water level exceeding 16 m (53 ft) above normal. In 1936, when natural disaster struck Central China with widespread flooding affecting Hebei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Wuhan and Chongqing caused by the Yangtze and Huai Rivers bursting their banks, Ong Seok Kim, as Chairman of the Sitiawan Fundraising and Disaster Relief Committee, raised money and materials in support of the victims.\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War and following the fall of Nanking in December 1937, Wuhan had become the provisional capital of China's Kuomintang government, and became another focal point of pitched air battles beginning in early 1938 between modern monoplane bomber and fighter aircraft of the Imperial Japanese forces and the Chinese Air Force, which included support from the Soviet Volunteer Group in both planes and personnel, as U.S. support in war materials waned. As the battle raged on through 1938, Wuhan and the surrounding region had become the site of the Battle of Wuhan. After being taken by the Japanese in late 1938, Wuhan became a major Japanese logistics center for operations in southern China.\n\nIn early October 1938, Japanese troops moved east and north in the outskirts of Wuhan. As a result, numerous companies and enterprises and large numbers of people had to withdraw from Wuhan to the west of Hubei and Sichuan. The KMT navy undertook the responsibility of defending the Yangtze River on patrol and covering the withdrawal. On October 24, while overseeing the waters of the Yangtze River near the town of Jinkou (Jiangxia District in Wuhan) in Wuchang, the KMT gunboat Zhongshan came up against six Japanese aircraft. Though two were eventually shot down, the Zhongshan sank with 25 casualties. Raised from the bottom of the Yangtze River in 1997, and restored at a local shipyard, the Zhongshan has been moved to a purpose-built museum in Wuhan's suburban Jiangxia District, which opened on September 26, 2011.As a key center on the Yangtze, Wuhan was an important base for Japanese operations in China. On 18 December 1944, Wuhan was bombed by 77 American bombers that set off a firestorm that destroyed much of the city. For the next three days, Wuhan was bombed by the Americans, destroying all of the docks and warehouses of Wuhan, as well as the Japanese air bases in the city. The air raids killed thousands of Chinese civilians which American bombers did not know. \"According to casualty statistics compiled by Hankou city in 1946, more than 20,000 were killed or injured in the December bombings of 1944.\"Wuhan returned to Chinese control in September 1945. Administratively, Wuchang and Hanyang were initially combined into a new City of Wuchang, but in October 1946 were separated into the City of Wuchang (including Wuchang only) and the County of Hanyang. Hankou became a centrally controlled municipality in August 1947. Militarily, the Wuhan Forward Headquarters was established in Wuhan, headed by Bai Chongxi.\n\nDuring the later stages of the Chinese Civil War, Bai sought to broker peace, proposing that the Communist Party could rule northern China while the Nationalist government retained southern China. This was rejected, and on 15 May 1949 Bai and the Wuhan garrison retreated from the city. People's Liberation Army troops entered Wuhan on the afternoon of Monday, May 16, 1949.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n\nThe Changjiang Water Resources Commission was reestablished in February 1950 with its headquarters in Wuhan. From June to September 1954, the Yangtze River Floods were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to an unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. In 1969, a large stone monument was erected in the riverside park in Hankou honoring the heroic deeds in fighting the 1954 Yangtze River floods.\nBefore construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, Hunslet Engine Company built two extra heavy 0-8-0 locomotives for loading the train ferries for crossing the Yangtze River in Wuhan.\nThe project of building the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also known as the First Yangtze River Bridge, was regarded as one of the key projects during the first five-year plan. On October 25, 1955, construction began on the bridge proper. The same day in 1957, the whole project was completed and an opening-to-traffic ceremony was held on October 15. The First Yangtze River Bridge united the Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway with the Guangdong\u2013Hankou Railway into the Beijing\u2013Guangzhou Railway, making Wuhan a 'thoroughfare to nine provinces' (\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862) in name and in fact.\nAfter Chengdu Conference, Mao went to Chongqing and Wuhan in April to inspect the countryside and factories. In Wuhan, he called all the leaders of provinces and municipalities who had not attended Chengdu Conference to report their work. Tian Jiaying, the secretary of Mao, said that Wuhan Conference was a supplement to Chengdu Conference.In July 1967, civil strife struck the city in the Wuhan Incident (\"July 20th Incident\"), an armed conflict between two hostile groups who were fighting for control over the city at the height of the Cultural Revolution.In 1981, the Wuhan City Government commenced reconstruction of the Yellow Crane Tower at a new location, about 1 km (0.62 mi) from the original site, and it was completed in 1985. In 1957, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was built with one trestle of the bridge on the site of the tower, which had been last destroyed in 1884.During the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, students in Wuhan blocked the Yangtze River Railway bridge and another 4,000 gathered at the railway station. About one thousand students staged a railroad 'sit-in'. Rail traffic on the Beijing-Guangzhou and Wuhan-Dalian lines was interrupted. The students also urged employees of major state-owned enterprises to go on strike. The situation was so tense that residents reportedly began a bank run and resorted to panic-buying.\n\nIn the wake of the United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade on May 7, 1999, protests broke out throughout China, including in Wuhan.On June 22, 2000, a Wuhan Airlines flight from Enshi to Wuhan was forced to circle for 30 minutes due to thunderstorms. The aircraft eventually crashed on the banks of Han River in Hanyang District, all on-board perished (there were varying accounts of number of crews and passengers). In addition, the crash also killed 7 people on the ground.Chinese protesters organized boycotts of the French-owned retail chain Carrefour in major Chinese cities including Kunming, Hefei and Wuhan, accusing the French nation of pro-secessionist conspiracy and anti-Chinese racism. The BBC reported that hundreds of people demonstrated in Beijing, Wuhan, Hefei, Kunming and Qingdao. On May 19, 2011, Fang Binxing, the Principal of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (also known as \"Father of China's Great Fire Wall\") was hit on the chest by a shoe thrown at him by a Huazhong University of Science and Technology student who calls herself \"hanjunyi\" (\u5bd2\u541b\u4f9d, or \u5c0f\u6e56\u5317) while Fang was giving a lecture at Wuhan University.The city has been subject to devastating floods, which are now supposed to be controlled by the ambitious Three Gorges Dam, a project which was completed in 2008. The 2008 Chinese winter storms damaged water supply equipment in Wuhan: up to 100,000 people were out of running water when several water pipes burst, cutting the supply to local households. The 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat wave hit Wuhan on July 3.\nIn the 2010 China floods, the Han River at Wuhan experienced its worst flooding in twenty years, as officials continued sandbagging efforts along the Han and Yangtze Rivers in the city and checked reservoirs. In the 2011 China floods, Wuhan was flooded, with parts of the city losing power. In the 2016 China floods, Wuhan saw 570 mm (22 in) of rainfall during the first week of July, surpassing the record that fell on the city in 1991. A red alert for heavy rainfall was issued on 2 July, the same day that eight people died after a 15-meter (49 ft) section of a 2 m (6.6 ft) tall wall collapsed on top of them. The city's subway system, the Wuhan Metro was partially submerged as was the main railway station. At least 14 city residents were killed, one was missing, and more than 80,000 were relocated.In early July 2019, there were protests against plans for a new incinerator in Xinzhou District.The 2019 Military World Games were hosted in Wuhan in October.\nIn December 2019, an epidemic of a new coronavirus disease began in Wuhan. The disease, which became known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), spread and developed into the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Wuhan and other Hubei cities were placed under lockdown for nearly three months to contain the disease. On April 8, 2020, the Wuhan lockdown officially came to an end after no new domestic cases were reported in Hubei province.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Overview ===\n\nWuhan is in east-central Hubei, at latitude 29\u00b0 58'\u201331\u00b0 22' N and longitude 113\u00b0 41'\u2013115\u00b0 05' E. Wuhan sits at the confluence of the Han River flowing into the Yangtze River at the East of the Jianghan Plain along the Yangtze's middle reaches.\nThe metropolitan area comprises three parts\u2014Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang\u2014commonly called the \"Three Towns of Wuhan\" (hence the name \"Wuhan\", combining \"Wu\" from the first city and \"Han\" from the other two). The consolidation of these cities occurred in 1927 and Wuhan was thereby established. The three former cities face each other across the rivers and are linked by bridges, including one of the first modern bridges in China, known as the \"First Bridge\".\n\nWuchang lies South East of the Yangtze River that separates it from both Hankou and Hanyang.\nHankou sits North of the Yangtze River separating it from Wuchang. Hankou is North of the Han River separating it from Hanyang.\nHanyang lies West of the Yangtze separating it from Wuchang. Hanyang is south of the Han river separating it from Hankou.\nIt is simple in terrain \u2014 low and flat in the middle and hilly in the south, with the Yangtze and Han rivers winding through the city. The She River enters the Yangtze in Huangpi District. Wuhan occupies a land area of 8,494.41 square kilometers (3,279.71 sq mi), most of which is alluvial plain and decorated with hills and a great number of lakes and ponds. Water makes up one quarter of Wuhan's urban territory, which is the highest percentage among  major cities in China. Wuhan has nearly 200 lakes, including the East Lake of 33 km2, and Tangxun Lake, which are the largest lakes entirely within a city in China.Other well-known lakes include South Lake and Sand Lake. Liangzi Lake, the largest lake by surface area in Hubei province, is located in the southeast of Jiangxia District. At 709 m (2,326 ft) above sea level, the highest point in Wuhan is the main peak of Yunwu Mountain (\u4e91\u96fe\u5c71) in northwestern Huangpi District. There are also several mountains within the city limits of Wuhan including Mount Luojia (\u73de\u73c8\u5c71) in Wuchang District as well as Mount Hong (\u6d2a\u5c71) and Mount Yujia (\u55bb\u5bb6\u5c71/\u745c\u73c8\u5c71) in Hongshan District.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nWuhan's climate is humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) with abundant rainfall in summer and four distinctive seasons. Wuhan is known for its humid summers, when dewpoints can often reach 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) or more. Historically, along with Chongqing and Nanjing, Wuhan is referred to as one of the \"Three Furnacelike Cities\" along the Yangtze River for their hot summers. However, the climate data of recent years suggests that Wuhan is no longer among the top tier of \"The hottest cities in summer\" list, the New Four Furnacelike Cities are Chongqing, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, and Nanchang. Spring and autumn are generally mild, while winter is cool with quite low rainfall and occasional snow. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from 4.0 \u00b0C (39.2 \u00b0F) in January to 29.1 \u00b0C (84.4 \u00b0F) in July. Annual precipitation totals just under 1,320 mm (52 in), the majority of which falls from April to July; the annual mean temperature is 17.13 \u00b0C (62.8 \u00b0F), the frost-free period lasts 211 to 272 days. With monthly possible sunshine percentage ranging from 31 percent in March to 59 percent in August, the city proper receives 1,865 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extreme low and high temperatures recorded are \u221218.1 \u00b0C (\u22121 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1977 and 39.7 \u00b0C (103 \u00b0F) on 27 July 2017 (unofficial record of 41.3 \u00b0C (106 \u00b0F) in 1934).\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nWuhan is a sub-provincial city. Municipal government is regulated by the local Communist Party of China (CPC), led by the Wuhan CPC Secretary (Chinese: \u6b66\u6c49\u5e02\u59d4\u4e66\u8bb0), Wang Zhonglin (\u738b\u5fe0\u6797). The local CPC issues administrative orders, collects taxes, manages the economy, and directs a standing committee of the Municipal People's Congress in making policy decisions and overseeing the local government.\nGovernment officials include the mayor (\u5e02\u957f), Zhou Xianwang (\u5468\u5148\u65fa), and vice-mayors.

Since 2004 it has been a focal point of the Rise of Central China Plan, which aims to build less-developed inland economies into hubs of advanced manufacturing.\nSince 1890, the steel industry has been the backbone of Wuhan's industry. In 2010, automobile industry exceeded GDP for Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO) steel for the first time. There are 5 car manufacturers, including Dongfeng Honda, Citroen, Shanghai GM, DFM Passenger Vehicle and Dongfeng Renault. Dongfeng-Citroen Automobile Co., Ltd is headquartered in the city.As of 2016, Wuhan has attracted foreign investment from over 80 countries, with 5,973 foreign-invested enterprises established in the city with a total capital injection of $22.45 billion USD. Among these, about 50 French companies including Renault and PSA Group have operations in the city, representing over one third of French investment in China, and the highest level of French investment in any Chinese city.Wuhan is an important center for economy, trade, finance, transportation, information technology, and education in China. Its major industries include optic-electronic, automobile manufacturing, iron and steel manufacturing, new pharmaceutical sector, biology engineering, new materials industry and environmental protection.  Environmental sustainability is highlighted in Wuhan's list of emerging industries, which include energy efficiency technology and renewable energy.\n\n\n=== Industrial zones ===\nMajor industrial zones in Wuhan include in chronological order:\n\nWuhan Economic and Technological Development ZoneWuhan Economic and Technological Development Zone is a national level industrial zone incorporated in 1993.

The first 0.7-square-kilometer (0.3-square-mile) area has already been created.\nWuhan Donghu New Technology Development ZoneWuhan Donghu New Technology Development Zone is a national level high-tech development zone. Optical-electronics, telecommunications, and equipment manufacturing are the core industries of Wuhan East Lake High-Tech Development Zone (ELHTZ) while software outsourcing and electronics are also encouraged. ELHTZ is China's largest production center for optoelectronic products with key players like Yangtze Optical Fiber and Cable, (the largest fiber-optical cable maker in China), and Fiberhome Telecommunications. Wuhan Donghu New Technology Development Zone also represents the development center for China's laser industry with key players such as HG Tech and Chutian Laser being based in the zone.\nWuhan Optical Valley (Guanggu) Software ParkWuhan Optical Valley (Guanggu) Software Park is located in Wuhan Donghu New Technology Development Zone. Wuhan Optics Valley Software Park is jointly developed by East Lake High-Tech Development Zone and Dalian Software Park Co., Ltd. The planned area is 0.67 square kilometers (0.26 square miles) with total floor area of 6,000,000 square meters (65,000,000 square feet). The zone is 8.5 km (5.28 mi) away from the 316 National Highway and is 46.7 km (29.02 mi) away from the Wuhan Tianhe Airport.\n\nWuhan BiolakeBiolake is an industrial base established in 2008 in the Optics Valley of China. Located in East Lake New Technology Development Zone of Wuhan, Biolake covers 15 km2 (5.8 sq mi), and has six parks including Bio-innovation Park, Bio-pharma Park, Bio-agriculture Park, Bio-manufacturing Park, Medical Device Park and Medical Health Park, to accommodate both research activities and living.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nWuhan is the most populous city in Central China and among the most populous in China.  In the Sixth Census of China in 2010, Wuhan's built-up area made of 8 out of 10 urban districts (all but Xinzhou and Hannan not yet conurbated) was home to 8,821,658 inhabitants. As of 2015, the city of Wuhan had an estimated population of 10,607,700 people.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 19 million.\nAs of November 2019, urban development status considering both spatial and socioeconomic processes has been examined using Night Time Lighting data and land cover data as proxies; it showed Wuhan's high concentration\nof socioeconomic activities compared to its urban spatial development.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nAccording to a survey published in 2017, 79.2% of the population of Wuhan are either irreligious or practice worship of gods and ancestors; among these 0.9% are Taoists. Among other religious doctrines, 14.7% of the population adheres to Buddhism, 2.9% to Protestantism, 0.3% to Catholicism and 1.6% to Islam, and 1.6% of the population adheres to unspecified other religions.\nReligious sites in Wuhan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nChina Railway Wuhan Group manages the Wuhan Railway Hub. Wuhan Railway Hub is considered one of the four key railway hubs of China. The city of Wuhan is served by three major railway stations: the Hankou Railway Station in Hankou, the Wuchang Railway Station in Wuchang, and the Wuhan Railway Station, located in a newly developed area east of the East Lake (Hongshan District). As the stations are many miles apart, it is important for passengers to be aware of the particular station(s) used by a particular train.\nThe (original) Hankou Station was the terminus for the Jinghan Railway from Beijing, while the Wuchang Station was the terminus for the Yuehan Railway to Guangzhou. Since the construction of the First Yangtze Bridge and the linking of the two lines into the Jingguang Railway, both Hankou and Wuchang stations have been served by trains going to all directions, which contrasts with the situation in such cities as New York or Moscow, where different stations serve different directions.\nWith the opening of the Hefei-Wuhan high-speed railway on April 1, 2009, Wuhan became served by high-speed trains with Hefei, Nanjing, and Shanghai; several trains a day now connect the city with Shanghai, getting there in under 6 hours. As of early 2010, most of these express trains leave from the Hankou Railway Station.\n\nIn 2006, construction began on the new Wuhan Railway Station with 11 platforms, located on the northeastern outskirts of the city. In December 2009, the station was opened, as China unveiled its second high-speed train with scheduled runs from Guangzhou to Wuhan. Billed as the fastest train in the world, it can reach a speed of 394 km/h (244.82 mph). The travel time between the two cities has been reduced from ten and a half hours to just three. The rail service has been extended north to Beijing.As of 2011, the new Wuhan Railway Station is primarily used by the Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed trains, while most regular trains to other destinations continue to use the Hankou and Wuchang stations.\n\nConstruction work is carried out on several lines of the new Wuhan Metropolitan Area Intercity Railway, which will eventually connect Wuhan's three main rail terminals with several stations throughout the city's outer areas and farther suburbs, as well as with the nearby cities of Xianning, Huangshi, Huanggang, and Xiaogan. The first line of the system, the one to Xianning, opened for passenger operations at the end of 2013. The line to Xiaogen opened on 1 December 2016 and it was extended with the opening of the Wuhan\u2013Shiyan high-speed railway to Shiyan on 29 November 2019.The main freight railway station and classification yard of the Wuhan metropolitan area is the extensive Wuhan North railway station, with 112 tracks and over 650 switches. It is located in Hengdian Subdistrict of Huangpi District, located 20 km (12 mi) north of the Wuhan Station and 23 km (14 mi) from Hankou Station.\n\n\n=== Wuhan Metro ===\n\nWuhan Metro is a rapid transit system serving the city of Wuhan. Owned and operated by Wuhan Metro Group Co., Ltd., the network now includes 9 lines, 228 stations, and 339 km (211 mi) of route length. Line 1, the first line in the system, opened on 28 July 2004, which made Wuhan became the seventh city in mainland China with rapid transit system, after Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Changchun, and Dalian. Line 2 opened on 28 December 2012 and is the first underground metro line crossing the Yangtze River. With 1.22 billion annual passengers in 2019, Wuhan Metro is the sixth-busiest rapid transit system in mainland China. There are a number of lines or sections under construction. The government of Wuhan City promised the citizens that at least two lines or sections open every year. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire network was out of service from 23 January to 27 March 2020.\n\n\n=== Trams ===\n\nTrams were brought to the streets of Wuhan on July 28, 2017 with the first line (Auto-city T1 Line) opened that day. The trams under construction or planning in Wuhan are:\n\nAuto-city trams, with Lines T1, T2, T6, and T8 in the Wuhan Economic Development Area, in the far western reaches on Hanyang. T1 Line is operational as of 2017.\nOptics Valley trams, two lines  (T1 and T2) south and east of Guanggu Circle (Guanggu Guangchang) in southeastern Wuchang. The system opened on January 18, 2018.\nThe Old Hankou Streetcar, a loop line around Hankou city.\n\n\n=== Maritime transport ===\nWuhan is a major hub for maritime transport in central China. The Port of Wuhan provide services for the local population and shipping services.\n\n\n=== Ferry ===\nAs a city located at bank of Yangtze River, Wuhan has long history of ferry services. Modern ferry services were established in 1900 by steam boat. In 1937, a train ferry was established to transport train cars from Hankou to Wuchang. There are numbered stops around Wuhan where people can get on and off the ferry and there is a tourist ferry in the night.\nCurrently, ferry services are provided by the Wuhan Ferry Company. In 2010, the company bought 10 new ships to replace the ones that had been in service for 29 years.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nOpened in April 1995 to substitute for the old Hankou Wangjiadun Airport and Nanhu Airport as the major airport of Wuhan, Wuhan Tianhe International Airport is one of the busiest airports in central China. It is located in Wuhan's suburban Huangpi District 26 kilometers (16 mi) north of Wuhan city proper. The extension of Line 2 of Wuhan Metro to Tianhe Airport opened on 28 December 2016. It has also been selected as China's fourth international hub airport after Beijing Capital International Airport, Shanghai-Pudong and Guangzhou Baiyun. A second terminal was completed in March 2008, having been started in February 2005 with an investment of CNY 3.372 billion. International flights to neighboring Asian countries have also been enhanced, including direct flights to Tokyo and Nagoya, Japan. Terminal 3 has been available for service since early 2017.\nHannan Municipal Airport is an municipal airport that serves Hannan District. It is the biggest airport in China that only handles general aviation, and the biggest municipal airport in Hubei Province. Caidian Municipal Airport is an under-construction airport which will serve Caidian District. The airport began construction on 1 December 2017.\n\n\n=== Highways and expressways ===\nNumerous major highways and expressways pass through Wuhan, including:\n\nChina National Highway 107\nChina National Highway 316\nChina National Highway 318\nG42 Shanghai\u2013Chengdu Expressway\nG0422 Wuhan\u2013Shenzhen Expressway\n\n\n=== Bicycle-sharing system ===\nAs of May 2011, the Wuhan and Hangzhou Public Bicycle bike-share systems in China were the largest in the world, with around 90,000 and 60,000 bicycles respectively. In 2012 the Wuhan and Hangzhou Public Bicycle programs in China are the largest in the world, with around 90,000 and 60,000 bicycles respectively. China has seen a rise in private \"dockless\" bike shares with fleets that dwarf systems in size outside China. Initially, a number of traditional (third generation) docked public bike systems operated by local municipal governments opened across China, with the largest ones being in Wuhan and Hangzhou.  The first was introduced in Beijing in 2007.  However, third generation bike sharing is not considered successful for the majority cities in China.  Bike sharing in Beijing virtually stopped and it also has encountered difficulties in Shanghai and Wuhan.\n\n\n== Destinations ==\n\nThe Yellow Crane Tower (Huanghelou) is presumed to have been first built in approximately 220 AD. The tower has been destroyed and reconstructed numerous times, and was burned last according to some sources in 1884. The tower underwent complete reconstruction in 1981. The reconstruction utilized modern materials and added an elevator while maintaining the traditional design in the tower's outward appearance.\nWuchang has the largest and second largest lakes within a city in China, the East Lake and Tangxun Lake, as well as the South Lake. East Lake in Wuhan is six times the size of the West Lake in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province. The total area is more than 80 km2 (31 sq mi) of which the lake is covering an area of 33 km2 (13 sq mi). In the springtime, the shores of East Lake become a garden of flowers with the Mei blossoms as the king and the Cherry Blossom as the queen among the species at East Lake Cherry Blossom Park.

Since the 1950s it has received international students from more than 109 countries.\n\n\n=== Scientific research ===\n\nWuhan contains three national development zones and four scientific and technological development parks, as well as numerous enterprise incubators, over 350 research institutes, 1470 high-tech enterprises, and over 400,000 experts and technicians.\nFounded in 1958, the Wuhan Branch of Chinese Academy of Sciences is one of the twelve national branches of CAS. It is composed of 9 independent organizations, including the headquarters at Xiaohongshan, Wuchang. It has had a staff of 3,900, among which 8 are CAS fellows, and one is a Chinese Academy of Engineering fellow. As of 2013, the achievements gained by WHB had won 23 National Awards and 778 Provincial Awards. Wuhan Research Institute of Post and Telecommunications (now known as FiberHome Technologies Group) is the national center for optical communication research in China, and is where the first optical fiber in the country was produced.Wuhan University of Technology is another major national university in the area. Founded in the year 2000, it was merged from three major universities, Wuhan University of Technology (established in 1948), Wuhan Transportation University (established in 1946) and Wuhan Automotive Polytechnic University (established in 1958). Wuhan University of Technology is one of the leading Chinese universities accredited by the Ministry of Education and one of the universities constructed with priority by \"State Project 211\" for Chinese higher education institutions. The University has three main campuses located in the Wuchang District.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe headquarters of Hubei Television is located in Wuchang District. Tortoise Mountain TV Tower is China's first self-developed TV tower, opened in 1986. The modern newspapers in Wuhan can be dated back to 1866, when Hankow Times, a newspaper in English, was founded. Before 1949, more than 50 newspapers and magazines were published by foreigners in Wuhan. Chao-wen Hsin-pao, founded by Ai Xiaomei in 1873, was the first Chinese newspaper to appear in Hankou (one of the cities that was merged into Wuhan). During the Northern Expedition era (1926\u20131928), journalism in Wuhan came to a climax; more than 120 newspapers and periodicals, including national newspapers such as Central Daily News and Republican Daily News, were founded or published during this time. Chutian Metropolis Daily and Wuhan Evening News are two major local commercial tabloid newspapers. Both of them have entered the list of 100 most widely circulated newspapers of the world.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe plum blossom is the city's emblem, chosen partly because of the long history of local plum cultivation and use, and partly to recognize the plum's current economic significance in terms of cultivation and research. Local wild plums were used medicinally during the Qin and Han dynasties. Cultivation of the fruit began during the Song dynasty. Some traditional new year customs revolve around the planting of plums.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nWuhan natives speak a variety of Southwestern Mandarin Chinese referred to as Wuhan dialect that differs slightly between the districts of Wuhan, including Wuchang dialect in Wuchang District, Hankou dialect in the Hankou districts, Hanyang dialect in Hanyang District, and Qingshan dialect in Qingshan District.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nHubei cuisine is one of China's ten major styles of cooking. With a history of more than 2,000 years, Hubei cuisine, originating in ancient Chu cuisine, has developed a number of distinctive dishes, such as steamed blunt-snout bream in clear soup, preserved ham with flowering Chinese cabbage, and others. On the third day of the third month of the lunar calendar, many in Wuhan eat d\u00ecc\u00e0i zh\u01d4 j\u012bd\u00e0n (\u5730\u83dc\u716e\u9e21\u86cb), an egg dish which is supposed to prevent illness in the coming year.\"No need to be particular about the recipes; all foods have their own uses. Rice wine and tangyuan are excellent midnight snacks, while fat bream and flowering Chinese cabbages are great delicacies.\" This attitude expressed in Hankou Zhuzhici reflects indirectly the eating habits and a wide variety of distinctive snacks with a long history in Wuhan, such as Qingshuizong (a pyramid-shaped dumpling made of glutinous rice wrapped in bamboo or reed leaves) in the Period of the Warring States, Chunbinbian in Northern and Southern dynasties, mung bean jelly in the Sui dynasty, youguo (a deep-fried twisted dough stick) in the Song and Yuan dynasties, rice wine and mianwo in the Ming and Qing dynasties, as well as three-delicacy stuffed skin of bean milk, tangbao (steamed dumpling filled with minced meat and gravy) and hot braised noodles (reganmian) in modern times.\nGuozao (\u904e\u65e9) is a popular way to say 'having breakfast' in Wuhan, and a part of the city's culture. As a hub for land transport in China, Wuhan has gathered and mixed together various habits and customs from neighboring cities and provinces in all directions, which gives rise to a concentration of diverse cuisines from different places. The most famous place to guozao (have breakfast) is Hubu Street (\u6236\u90e8\u5df7), a 150-meter-long street in the neighborhood of Simenkou (\u53f8\u95e8\u53e3). Along its short length one can find nearly all the traditional foods of Wuhan, such as:\n\nHot and dry noodles, re-gan mian (\u70ed\u5e72\u9762), consists of long freshly boiled noodles mixed with sesame paste. It is considered to be the most typical local food for breakfast.\nDuck's neck or Ya Bozi (\u9e2d\u8116\u5b50) is a local version of this popular Chinese dish, made of duck necks and spices.\nBean skin or doupi (\u8c46\u76ae) is a local dish with a filling of egg, rice, beef, mushrooms and beans cooked between two large round soybean skins and cut into pieces, structurally like a stuffed pizza without enclosing edges.\nSoup dumpling or xiaolongtangbao (\u5c0f\u7b3c\u6c64\u5305) is a kind of dumpling with thin skin made of flour, steamed with very juicy meat inside, hence the name: tang (soup) bao (bun) \u2013 every time one takes a bite from it the \"soup\" inside is liable to spill out.\nA salty doughnut or mianwo (\u9eaa\u7aa9) is a kind of savory donut with a salty taste. It is much thinner than a common donut and is a typical Wuhan local food.\n\n\n=== Opera ===\nHan opera, which is the local opera of Wuhan area, was one of China's oldest and most popular operas. During the late Qing dynasty, Han opera, blended with Hui opera, gave birth to Peking opera, the most popular opera in modern China. Thus Han opera has been called the \"mother of Peking opera.\"\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nWuhan has a professional football team, Wuhan Zall F.C., that plays in the Chinese Super League. Xinhua Road Sport Center, the team's home stadium, with a capacity of 32,137, is located in the heart of the city next to Zhongshan Park. For the 2013 season, Wuhan Zall was promoted to the top-tier league of Chinese football, Chinese Super League, and relocated its home to Wuhan Sports Center Stadium, a modern stadium with 54,357 seats located in the suburbs of the city. However, the team did not play well in the ensuing season and was demoted back to China League One as the 2013 season ended. For financial and transportation reasons, the team moved back to Xinhua Road Sport Center in 2014.\nThe Wuhan Gators are a professional arena football team based in Wuhan. They are members of the China Arena Football League (CAFL).The 13,000-seat Wuhan Gymnasium held the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship and was one of the venues for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup. The 7th Military World Games were hosted in Wuhan from Oct. 18 to 27, 2019.The city has been the venue for the women's tennis tournament, the Wuhan Open, one of the WTA's Premier 5 tournaments, since 2014.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Bridges ===\n\nWuhan has eleven bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze River. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also called the First Bridge, was built over the Yangtze in 1957, carrying a railroad directly across the river between hills known as Snake Hill and Turtle Hill. Before this bridge was built it could take up to an entire day to barge railcars across. Including its approaches, it is 5,511 feet (1,680 m) long, and it accommodates both a double-track railway on a lower deck and a four-lane roadway above. It was built with the assistance of advisers from the Soviet Union.\nThe Second Bridge, a cable-stayed bridge built of prestressed concrete, has a central span of 400 meters (1,300 feet); it is 4,678 meters (15,348 feet) in length (including 1,877 meters (6,158 feet) of the main bridge) and 26.5 to 33.5 meters (86.9 to 109.9 feet) in width. Its main bridgeheads are 90 meters (300 feet) high each, pulling 392 thick slanting cables together in the shape of double fans so that the central span of the bridge is well poised on the piers and the bridge's stability and vibration resistance are ensured. With six lanes on the deck, the bridge is designed to handle the daily passage of 50,000 motor vehicles. The bridge was completed in 1995.\n\nThe Third Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also called Baishazhou Bridge, was completed in September 2000. Located 8.6 kilometers (5.3 miles) southwest of the First Bridge, construction of Baishazhou Bridge started in 1997. With an investment of over 1.4 billion yuan (about US$170,000,000), the bridge, which is 3,586 meters (11,765 feet) long and 26.5 meters (86.9 feet) wide, has six lanes and has a capacity of 50,000 vehicles a day. The bridge is expected to serve as a major passage for the future Wuhan Ring Road, greatly easing the city's traffic and aiding local economic development.\nThe Yangluo Bridge carries Wuhan's Ring Road across the Yangtze in the city's eastern suburbs (connecting the Hongshan District with the Xinzhou District). It was opened on December 26, 2007.\nThe Wuhan Tianxingzhou Yangtze River Bridge crosses the Yangtze in the northeastern part of the city, downstream of the Second bridge. It is named after Tianxing Island (Tianxingzhou), above which it crosses the river. Built at a cost of 11 billion yuan, the 4,657-meter cable suspension bridge was opened on December 26, 2009, in time for the opening of the Wuhan Railway Station. It is a combined road and rail bridge, and carries the Wuhan\u2013Guangzhou High-Speed Railway across the river.\n\n\n=== Skyscrapers ===\n\nThe Yellow Crane Tower, historically one of the tallest buildings in Wuhan, is considered one of the Four Great Towers of China and was destroyed twelve times, both by warfare and by fire. The tower is classified as an AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration. At 438 meters (1,437 ft) in height, the Wuhan Center skyscraper, the tallest structure in Wuhan and in Central China, is the eighth tallest structure in China. The Minsheng Bank Building, the second tallest structure in Wuhan, was the tallest building in Wuhan when it was completed in 2007. It retained the title until Wuhan Center surpassed it in 2014. Wuhan World Trade Tower is a 273-meter (896 foot) tall skyscraper located in Wuhan. It became the tallest building in Wuhan after its completion in 1998. However, it was surpassed by the Minsheng Bank Building in 2007.\nThe Wuhan Greenland Center is a planned 636-meter (2,087 ft), 126-floor mixed-use skyscraper currently under construction and scheduled for completion in 2019. If completed as planned, it will be among the world's tallest structures, and one of the world's tallest buildings by occupiable floor height. The Phoenix Towers are proposed supertall skyscrapers planned for construction in Wuhan. At 1 kilometer (3,300 ft) high, the towers would also be among the tallest structures in the world when completed.\n\n\n== Notable Wuhanese ==\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nLi Yuanhong \u2013 former President of the Republic of China (1916\u201317, 1922\u201323).\nWu Yi \u2013 former Vice-Premier and Minister of Health of the People's Republic of China\n\n\n=== Business ===\nWei Brian - Chinese entrepreneur\n\n\n=== Science ===\nChang-Lin Tien \u2013 seventh Chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley (1990\u20131997) and a major founder of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering (NAE).

        "wiki": "Wuhan (simplified Chinese: \u6b66\u6c49; traditional Chinese: \u6b66\u6f22, [\u00f9.x\u00e2n] (listen)) is the capital city of Hubei Province in the People's Republic of China. It is the largest city in Hubei and the most populous city in Central China, with a population of over 11 million, the ninth most populous Chinese city and one of the nine National Central Cities of China.The name \"Wuhan\" came from the city's historical origin from the conglomeration of Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang, which are collectively known as the \"Three Towns of Wuhan\" (\u6b66\u6c49\u4e09\u9547).  It lies in the eastern Jianghan Plain, at the confluence of the Yangtze river and its largest tributary, the Han River and is known as \"Nine Provinces' Thoroughfare\" (\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862).Wuhan is considered by some to be one of the potential sites of the pivotal Battle of the Red Cliffs, which stopped warlord Cao Cao's incursion into southern China at the end of the Eastern Han dynasty. Other historical events taking place in Wuhan include the Wuchang Uprising of 1911, which led to the downfall of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China. Wuhan was briefly the capital of China in 1927 under the left wing of the Kuomintang (KMT) government led by Wang Jingwei. The city later served as the wartime capital of China for ten months in 1937 during the Second Sino-Japanese War. A novel coronavirus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic was first identified in Wuhan in December 2019.Wuhan is considered the political, economic, financial, commercial, cultural and educational center of Central China. It is a major transportation hub, with dozens of railways, roads and expressways passing through the city and connecting to other major cities. Because of its key role in domestic transportation, Wuhan is sometimes referred to as \"the Chicago of China\" by foreign sources. The \"Golden Waterway\" of the Yangtze River and the Han River traverse the urban area and divide Wuhan into the three districts of Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge crosses the Yangtze in the city. The Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest power station in terms of installed capacity, is located nearby. Historically, Wuhan has suffered risks of flooding, prompting the government to alleviate the situation by introducing ecologically friendly absorption mechanisms.While Wuhan has been a traditional manufacturing hub for decades, it is also one of the areas promoting modern industrial changes in China. Wuhan consists of three national development zones, four scientific and technological development parks, over 350 research institutes, 1,656 high tech enterprises, numerous enterprise incubators and investments from 230 Fortune Global 500 firms. It produced GDP of US$22.4 billion in 2018. The Dongfeng Motor Corporation, an automobile manufacturer, is headquartered in Wuhan. The city is home to multiple notable institutes of higher education, including Wuhan University and the Huazhong University of Science and Technology. In 2017, Wuhan was designated as a Creative City by UNESCO, in the field of design. Wuhan is classified as a Beta world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Wuhan\" is a portmanteau of the two major cities on the northern and southern banks of the Yangtze River that make up the Wuhan metropolis: \"Wu\" refers to the city of Wuchang (Chinese: \u6b66\u660c), which lies on the southern bank of the Yangtze, while \"Han\" refers to the city of Hankou (Chinese: \u6c49\u53e3), which lies on the northern bank of the Yangtze.\nIn 1926, the Northern Expedition reached the Wuhan area and it was decided to merge Hankou, Wuchang and Hanyang into one city in order to make a new capital for Nationalist China. On January 1, 1927, the resulting city was proclaimed as '\u6b66\u6f22' (the traditional Chinese characters for 'Wuhan'), which was later simplified as '\u6b66\u6c49' (also 'Wuhan').\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nThe Wuhan area has been settled for 3,500 years. Panlongcheng, an archaeological site primarily associated with the Erligang culture (c. 1510 \u2013 c. 1460 BC) (being sparsely populated during the earlier Erlitou period), is located in modern-day Huangpi District.\nDuring the Western Zhou the State of E, which gives its name to the single character abbreviation for Hubei province, controlled the present-day Wuchang area south of the Yangtze River. After the conquest of the E state in 863 BC, the present-day Wuhan area was controlled by the State of Chu for the rest of the Western Zhou and Eastern Zhou periods.  Chu was in turn conquered by Qin in 223 BCE.\n\n\n=== Imperial China ===\n\nDuring the Han dynasty, Hanyang became a fairly busy port. The Battle of Xiakou in AD 203 and Battle of Jiangxia five years later were fought over control of Jiangxia Commandery (present-day Xinzhou District in northeast Wuhan). In the winter of 208/9, one of the most famous battles in Chinese history and a central event in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms\u2014the Battle of Red Cliffs\u2014took place near the Yangtze River, with the cliffs near Wuhan identified as one of the potential locations. Around that time, walls were built to protect Hanyang (AD 206) and Wuchang (AD 223). The latter event marks the foundation of Wuhan. In AD 223, the Yellow Crane Tower, one of the Four Great Towers of China, was constructed on the Wuchang side of the Yangtze River by order of Sun Quan, leader of the Eastern Wu. The tower become a sacred site of Taoism.Due to tensions between the Eastern Wu and Cao Wei kingdoms, in the autumn of 228, Cao Rui, grandson of Cao Cao and the second emperor of the state of Cao Wei, ordered the general Man Chong to lead troops to Xiakou (\u590f\u53e3; in present-day Wuhan). In 279, Wang Jun and his army conquered strategic locations in Wu territory such as Xiling (in present-day Yichang, Hubei), Xiakou (\u590f\u53e3; present-day Hankou) and Wuchang (\u6b66\u660c; present-day Ezhou, Hubei).\nDuring the Northern and Southern dynasties period, the Wuhan area was part of the successive Southern dynasty states Liu Song (420\u2013479), Southern Qi (479\u2013502), Liang, and Western Liang.\nIn fall 550, Hou Jing sent Ren Yue to attack both Xiao Daxin and Xiao Fan's son Xiao Si (\u856d\u55e3).  Ren killed Xiao Si in battle, and Xiao Daxin, unable to resist, surrendered, allowing Hou to take his domain under control.  Meanwhile, Xiao Guan, who had by now settled at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan), was planning to attack Hou, but this drew Xiao Yi's ire\u2014believing that Xiao Guan was intending to contend for the throne\u2014and he sent Wang to attack Xiao Guan. In summer 567, Chen Xu commissioned Wu Mingche as the governor of Xiang Province and had him command a major part of the troops against Hua, along with Chunyu Liang (\u6df3\u4e8e\u91cf). The opposing sides met at Zhuankou (\u6c8c\u53e3, in modern Wuhan).\nThe city has long been renowned as a center for the arts (especially poetry) and for intellectual studies. Cui Hao, a celebrated poet of the Tang dynasty, visited the Yellow Crane Tower in the early 8th century; his poem made it the most celebrated building in southern China.In spring 877, Wang Xianzhi captured E Prefecture (\u9102\u5dde, in modern Wuhan).  He then returned north, joining forces with Huang again, and they surrounded Song Wei at Song Prefecture (\u5b8b\u5dde, in modern Shangqiu, Henan).  In winter 877, Huang Chao pillaged Qi and Huang (\u9ec3\u5dde, in modern Wuhan) Prefectures.\nBefore Kublai Khan arrived in 1259, word reached him that M\u00f6ngke had died. Kublai decided to keep the death of his brother secret and continued the attack on the Wuhan area, near the Yangtze. The present-day Wuying Pagoda was constructed at the end of the Song Dynasty between attacks by the Mongolian forces.  Under the Mongol rulers (Yuan dynasty) (after 1301), the Wuchang prefecture, headquartered in the town, became the capital of Hubei province. Hankou, from the Ming to late Qing, was under the administration of the local government in Hanyang, although it was already one of the four major national markets (zh:\u56db\u5927\u540d\u9547) of the Ming dynasty.\nHanyang's Guiyuan Temple was completed in the 15th year of Shunzhi (1658).By the dawn of the 18th century, Hankou had become one of China's top four most important towns of trade. In the late 19th century, railroads were extended on a north\u2013south axis through the city, making Wuhan an important transshipment point between rail and river traffic. Also during this period foreign powers extracted mercantile concessions, with the riverfront of Hankou being divided up into foreign-controlled merchant districts. These districts contained trading firm offices, warehouses, and docking facilities. The French had a concession in Hankou. During the Taiping Rebellion, the Wuhan area was controlled for many years by rebel forces and the Yellow Crane Tower, Xingfu Temple, Zhuodaoquan Temple and other buildings were repurposed or damaged. During the Second Opium War (known in the West as the Arrow War, 1856\u20131860), the government of the Qing dynasty was defeated by the western powers and signed the Treaties of Tianjin and the Convention of Peking, which stipulated eleven cities or regions (including Hankou) as trading ports. In December 1858, James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, High Commissioner to China, led four warships up the Yangtze River in Wuhan to collect the information needed for opening the trading port in Wuhan.\nIn the spring of 1861, Counselor Harry Parkes and Admiral Herbert were sent to Wuhan to open a trading port. On the basis of the Convention of Peking, Harry Parkes concluded the Hankou Lend-Lease Treaty with Guan Wen, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei. It brought an area of 30.53 square kilometers (11.79 sq mi) along the Yangtze River (from latter-day Jianghan Road to Hezuo Road) to become a British Concession and permitted Britain to set up its consulate in the concession.\n\nIn 1889, Zhang Zhidong was transferred from Viceroy of Liangguang (Guangdong and Guangxi provinces) to Viceroy of Huguang (Hunan and Hubei provinces). He governed the province for 18 years, until 1907. During this period, he elucidated the theory of \"Chinese learning as the basis, Western learning for application,\" known as the ti-yong ideal. He set up many heavy industries, founded Hanyang Steel Plant, Daye Iron Mine, Pingxiang Coal Mine and Hubei Arsenal and set up local textile industries, boosting the flourishing modern industry in Wuhan. Meanwhile, he initiated education reform, opened dozens of modern educational organizations successively, such as Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) Academy of Classical Learning, Civil General Institute, Military General Institute, Foreign Languages Institute and Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) General Normal School, and selected a great many students for study overseas, which well promoted the development of China's modern education. Furthermore, he trained a modern military and organized a modern army including a zhen and a xie (both zhen and xie are military units in the Qing dynasty) in Hubei.\nOriginally known as the Hubei Arsenal, the Hanyang Arsenal was founded in 1891 by Qing official Zhang Zhidong, who diverted funds from the Nanyang Fleet in Guangdong to build the arsenal. It cost about 250,000 pounds sterling and was built in 4 years. On 23 April 1894, construction was completed and the arsenal, occupying some 40 acres (160,000 m2), could start production of small-caliber cannons. It built magazine-fed rifles, Gruson quick fire guns, and cartridges.\n\n\n==== Wuchang Uprising ====\n\nBy 1900, according to Collier's magazine, Hankau, the Yangtze River boom town, was \"the St. Louis and Chicago of China.\" On October 10, 1911, Sun Yat-sen's followers launched the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the collapse of the Qing dynasty, as well as the establishment of the Chinese Republic.The Wuchang Uprising of October 1911, which overthrew the Qing dynasty, originated in Wuhan. Before the uprising, anti-Qing secret societies were active in Wuhan. In September 1911, the outbreak of the protests in Sichuan forced the Qing authorities to send part of the New Army garrisoned in Wuhan to suppress the rebellion. On September 14 the Literary Society (\u6587\u5b78\u793e) and the Progressive Association (\u5171\u9032\u6703), two local revolutionary organizations in Hubei, set up joint headquarters in Wuchang and planned for an uprising. On the morning of October 9, a bomb at the office of the political arrangement exploded prematurely and alerted local authorities. The proclamation for the uprising, beadroll and the revolutionaries\u2019 official seal fell into the hands of Rui Cheng, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei, who demolished the uprising headquarters the same day and set out to arrest the revolutionaries listed in the beadroll. This forced the revolutionaries to launch the uprising earlier than planned.On the night of October 10, the revolutionaries fired shots to signal the uprising at the engineering barracks of Hubei New Army. They then led the New Army of all barracks to join the revolution. Under the guidance of Wu Zhaolin, Cai Jimin and others, this revolutionary army seized the official residence of the governor and government offices. Rui Cheng fled in panic into the Chuyu ship. Zhang Biao, the commander of the Qing army, also fled the city. On the morning of the 11th, the revolutionary army took the whole city of Wuchang, but leaders such as Jiang Yiwu and Sun Wu disappeared. Thus the leaderless revolutionary army recommended Li Yuanhong, the assistant governor of the Qing army, as the commander-in-chief. Li founded the Hubei Military Government, proclaimed the abolition of the Qing rule in Hubei, the founding of the Republic of China and published an open telegram calling for other provinces to join the revolution.As the revolution spread to other parts of the country, the Qing government concentrated loyalist military forces to suppress the uprising in Wuhan. From October 17 to December 1, the revolutionary army and local volunteers defended the city in the Battle of Yangxia against better armed and more numerous Qing forces commanded by Yuan Shikai. Huang Xing would arrive in Wuhan in early November to take command of the revolutionary army. After fierce fighting and heavy casualties, Qing forces seized Hankou and Hanyang. But Yuan agreed to halt the advance on Wuchang and participated in peace talks, which would eventually lead to the return of Sun Yat-sen from exile, founding of the Republic of China on January 1, 1912. Through the Wuchang Uprising, Wuhan is known as the birthplace of the Xinhai Revolution, named after the Xinhai year on the Chinese calendar. The city has several museums and memorials to the revolution and the thousands of martyrs who died defending the revolution.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\n\nWith the northern extension of the Northern Expedition, the center of the Great Revolution shifted from the Pearl River basin to the Yangtze River basin. On November 26, the Kuomintang Central Political Committee decided to move the capital from Guangzhou to Wuhan. In mid-December, most of the KMT central executive commissioners and national government commissioners arrived in Wuhan, set up the temporary joint conference of central executive commissioners and National Government commissioners, performed the top functions of central party headquarters and National Government, declared they would work in Wuhan on January 1, 1927, and decided to combine the towns of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang into Wuhan City, called \"Capital District\". The new national government, later known as \"Wuhan nationalist government\", was based in the Nanyang Building in Hankou, while the central party headquarters and other organizations chose their locations in Hankou or Wuchang.In March 1927, Mao Zedong appeared at the Third Plenum of the KMT Central Executive Committee in Wuhan, which sought to strip General Chiang of his power by appointing Wang Jingwei leader. The first phase of the Northern Expedition was interrupted by the political split in the Kuomintang following the formation of the Nanjing faction in April 1927 against the existing faction in Wuhan. Members of the Chinese Communist Party, who had survived the April 12 massacre, met at Wuhan and reelected Chen Duxiu (Ch'en Tu-hsiu) as the Party's Secretary General. The split was partially motivated by the purge of the Communists within the party, which marked the end of the First United Front, and Chiang Kai-shek briefly stepped down as the commander of the National Revolutionary Army.In June 1927, Stalin sent a telegram to the Communists in Wuhan, calling for the mobilization of an army of workers and peasants. This alarmed Wang Jingwei, who decided to break with the Communists and come to terms with Chiang Kai-shek. The Wuhan coup was a political shift made on July 15, 1927, by Wang Jingwei towards Chiang Kai-shek, and his Shanghai-based rival in the Kuomintang. The Wuhan Nationalist Government was established in Wuhan on February 21, 1927, and ended by August 19, 1927. After the end of the Northern Expedition, Hankou was elevated to a centrally-controlled municipality.\n\nIn the 1931 China floods, one of the deadliest flood disasters in world history, Wuhan was a refuge for flood victims from outlying areas, who had been arriving since the late spring. But when the city itself was inundated in the early summer, and after a catastrophic dike failure just before 6:00 AM on July 27, an estimated 782,189 urban citizens and rural refugees were left homeless. The flood covered an area of 32 square miles and the city was flooded under many feet of water for close to three months. Large numbers gathered on flood islands throughout the city, with 30,000 sheltering on a railway embankment in central Hankou. With little food and a complete breakdown in sanitation, thousands soon began to succumb to diseases. Jin Shilong, Senior Engineer at the Hubei Flood Prevention Agency, described the flooding:There was no warning, only a sudden great wall of water. Most of Wuhan's buildings in those days were only one story high, and for many people there was no escape- they died by the tens of thousands. ... I was just coming off duty at the company's main office, a fairly new three-story building near the center of town ... When I heard the terrible noise and saw the wall of water coming, I raced to the top story of the building. ... I was in one of the tallest and strongest buildings left standing. At that time no one knew whether the water would subside or rise even higher.The high-water mark was reached on 19 August at Hankou, with the water level exceeding 16 m (53 ft) above normal. In 1936, when natural disaster struck Central China with widespread flooding affecting Hebei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Wuhan and Chongqing caused by the Yangtze and Huai Rivers bursting their banks, Ong Seok Kim, as Chairman of the Sitiawan Fundraising and Disaster Relief Committee, raised money and materials in support of the victims.\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War and following the fall of Nanking in December 1937, Wuhan had become the provisional capital of China's Kuomintang government, and became another focal point of pitched air battles beginning in early 1938 between modern monoplane bomber and fighter aircraft of the Imperial Japanese forces and the Chinese Air Force, which included support from the Soviet Volunteer Group in both planes and personnel, as U.S. support in war materials waned. As the battle raged on through 1938, Wuhan and the surrounding region had become the site of the Battle of Wuhan. After being taken by the Japanese in late 1938, Wuhan became a major Japanese logistics center for operations in southern China.\n\nIn early October 1938, Japanese troops moved east and north in the outskirts of Wuhan. As a result, numerous companies and enterprises and large numbers of people had to withdraw from Wuhan to the west of Hubei and Sichuan. The KMT navy undertook the responsibility of defending the Yangtze River on patrol and covering the withdrawal. On October 24, while overseeing the waters of the Yangtze River near the town of Jinkou (Jiangxia District in Wuhan) in Wuchang, the KMT gunboat Zhongshan came up against six Japanese aircraft. Though two were eventually shot down, the Zhongshan sank with 25 casualties. Raised from the bottom of the Yangtze River in 1997, and restored at a local shipyard, the Zhongshan has been moved to a purpose-built museum in Wuhan's suburban Jiangxia District, which opened on September 26, 2011.As a key center on the Yangtze, Wuhan was an important base for Japanese operations in China. On 18 December 1944, Wuhan was bombed by 77 American bombers that set off a firestorm that destroyed much of the city. For the next three days, Wuhan was bombed by the Americans, destroying all of the docks and warehouses of Wuhan, as well as the Japanese air bases in the city. The air raids killed thousands of Chinese civilians which American bombers did not know. \"According to casualty statistics compiled by Hankou city in 1946, more than 20,000 were killed or injured in the December bombings of 1944.\"Wuhan returned to Chinese control in September 1945. Administratively, Wuchang and Hanyang were initially combined into a new City of Wuchang, but in October 1946 were separated into the City of Wuchang (including Wuchang only) and the County of Hanyang. Hankou became a centrally controlled municipality in August 1947. Militarily, the Wuhan Forward Headquarters was established in Wuhan, headed by Bai Chongxi.\n\nDuring the later stages of the Chinese Civil War, Bai sought to broker peace, proposing that the Communist Party could rule northern China while the Nationalist government retained southern China. This was rejected, and on 15 May 1949 Bai and the Wuhan garrison retreated from the city. People's Liberation Army troops entered Wuhan on the afternoon of Monday, May 16, 1949.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n\nThe Changjiang Water Resources Commission was reestablished in February 1950 with its headquarters in Wuhan. From June to September 1954, the Yangtze River Floods were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to an unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. In 1969, a large stone monument was erected in the riverside park in Hankou honoring the heroic deeds in fighting the 1954 Yangtze River floods.\nBefore construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, Hunslet Engine Company built two extra heavy 0-8-0 locomotives for loading the train ferries for crossing the Yangtze River in Wuhan.\nThe project of building the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also known as the First Yangtze River Bridge, was regarded as one of the key projects during the first five-year plan. On October 25, 1955, construction began on the bridge proper. The same day in 1957, the whole project was completed and an opening-to-traffic ceremony was held on October 15. The First Yangtze River Bridge united the Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway with the Guangdong\u2013Hankou Railway into the Beijing\u2013Guangzhou Railway, making Wuhan a 'thoroughfare to nine provinces' (\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862) in name and in fact.\nAfter Chengdu Conference, Mao went to Chongqing and Wuhan in April to inspect the countryside and factories. In Wuhan, he called all the leaders of provinces and municipalities who had not attended Chengdu Conference to report their work. Tian Jiaying, the secretary of Mao, said that Wuhan Conference was a supplement to Chengdu Conference.In July 1967, civil strife struck the city in the Wuhan Incident (\"July 20th Incident\"), an armed conflict between two hostile groups who were fighting for control over the city at the height of the Cultural Revolution.In 1981, the Wuhan City Government commenced reconstruction of the Yellow Crane Tower at a new location, about 1 km (0.62 mi) from the original site, and it was completed in 1985. In 1957, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was built with one trestle of the bridge on the site of the tower, which had been last destroyed in 1884.During the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, students in Wuhan blocked the Yangtze River Railway bridge and another 4,000 gathered at the railway station. About one thousand students staged a railroad 'sit-in'. Rail traffic on the Beijing-Guangzhou and Wuhan-Dalian lines was interrupted. The students also urged employees of major state-owned enterprises to go on strike. The situation was so tense that residents reportedly began a bank run and resorted to panic-buying.\n\nIn the wake of the United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade on May 7, 1999, protests broke out throughout China, including in Wuhan.On June 22, 2000, a Wuhan Airlines flight from Enshi to Wuhan was forced to circle for 30 minutes due to thunderstorms. The aircraft eventually crashed on the banks of Han River in Hanyang District, all on-board perished (there were varying accounts of number of crews and passengers). In addition, the crash also killed 7 people on the ground.Chinese protesters organized boycotts of the French-owned retail chain Carrefour in major Chinese cities including Kunming, Hefei and Wuhan, accusing the French nation of pro-secessionist conspiracy and anti-Chinese racism. The BBC reported that hundreds of people demonstrated in Beijing, Wuhan, Hefei, Kunming and Qingdao. On May 19, 2011, Fang Binxing, the Principal of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (also known as \"Father of China's Great Fire Wall\") was hit on the chest by a shoe thrown at him by a Huazhong University of Science and Technology student who calls herself \"hanjunyi\" (\u5bd2\u541b\u4f9d, or \u5c0f\u6e56\u5317) while Fang was giving a lecture at Wuhan University.The city has been subject to devastating floods, which are now supposed to be controlled by the ambitious Three Gorges Dam, a project which was completed in 2008. The 2008 Chinese winter storms damaged water supply equipment in Wuhan: up to 100,000 people were out of running water when several water pipes burst, cutting the supply to local households. The 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat wave hit Wuhan on July 3.\nIn the 2010 China floods, the Han River at Wuhan experienced its worst flooding in twenty years, as officials continued sandbagging efforts along the Han and Yangtze Rivers in the city and checked reservoirs. In the 2011 China floods, Wuhan was flooded, with parts of the city losing power. In the 2016 China floods, Wuhan saw 570 mm (22 in) of rainfall during the first week of July, surpassing the record that fell on the city in 1991.

The disease, which became known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), spread and developed into the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Wuhan and other Hubei cities were placed under lockdown for nearly three months to contain the disease. On April 8, 2020, the Wuhan lockdown officially came to an end after no new domestic cases were reported in Hubei province.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Overview ===\n\nWuhan is in east-central Hubei, at latitude 29\u00b0 58'\u201331\u00b0 22' N and longitude 113\u00b0 41'\u2013115\u00b0 05' E. Wuhan sits at the confluence of the Han River flowing into the Yangtze River at the East of the Jianghan Plain along the Yangtze's middle reaches.\nThe metropolitan area comprises three parts\u2014Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang\u2014commonly called the \"Three Towns of Wuhan\" (hence the name \"Wuhan\", combining \"Wu\" from the first city and \"Han\" from the other two). The consolidation of these cities occurred in 1927 and Wuhan was thereby established. The three former cities face each other across the rivers and are linked by bridges, including one of the first modern bridges in China, known as the \"First Bridge\".\n\nWuchang lies South East of the Yangtze River that separates it from both Hankou and Hanyang.\nHankou sits North of the Yangtze River separating it from Wuchang. Hankou is North of the Han River separating it from Hanyang.\nHanyang lies West of the Yangtze separating it from Wuchang. Hanyang is south of the Han river separating it from Hankou.\nIt is simple in terrain \u2014 low and flat in the middle and hilly in the south, with the Yangtze and Han rivers winding through the city. The She River enters the Yangtze in Huangpi District. Wuhan occupies a land area of 8,494.41 square kilometers (3,279.71 sq mi), most of which is alluvial plain and decorated with hills and a great number of lakes and ponds. Water makes up one quarter of Wuhan's urban territory, which is the highest percentage among  major cities in China. Wuhan has nearly 200 lakes, including the East Lake of 33 km2, and Tangxun Lake, which are the largest lakes entirely within a city in China.Other well-known lakes include South Lake and Sand Lake. Liangzi Lake, the largest lake by surface area in Hubei province, is located in the southeast of Jiangxia District. At 709 m (2,326 ft) above sea level, the highest point in Wuhan is the main peak of Yunwu Mountain (\u4e91\u96fe\u5c71) in northwestern Huangpi District.

Historically, along with Chongqing and Nanjing, Wuhan is referred to as one of the \"Three Furnacelike Cities\" along the Yangtze River for their hot summers. However, the climate data of recent years suggests that Wuhan is no longer among the top tier of \"The hottest cities in summer\" list, the New Four Furnacelike Cities are Chongqing, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, and Nanchang. Spring and autumn are generally mild, while winter is cool with quite low rainfall and occasional snow. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from 4.0 \u00b0C (39.2 \u00b0F) in January to 29.1 \u00b0C (84.4 \u00b0F) in July.

Wuhan Railway Hub is considered one of the four key railway hubs of China. The city of Wuhan is served by three major railway stations: the Hankou Railway Station in Hankou, the Wuchang Railway Station in Wuchang, and the Wuhan Railway Station, located in a newly developed area east of the East Lake (Hongshan District). As the stations are many miles apart, it is important for passengers to be aware of the particular station(s) used by a particular train.\nThe (original) Hankou Station was the terminus for the Jinghan Railway from Beijing, while the Wuchang Station was the terminus for the Yuehan Railway to Guangzhou. Since the construction of the First Yangtze Bridge and the linking of the two lines into the Jingguang Railway, both Hankou and Wuchang stations have been served by trains going to all directions, which contrasts with the situation in such cities as New York or Moscow, where different stations serve different directions.\nWith the opening of the Hefei-Wuhan high-speed railway on April 1, 2009, Wuhan became served by high-speed trains with Hefei, Nanjing, and Shanghai; several trains a day now connect the city with Shanghai, getting there in under 6 hours. As of early 2010, most of these express trains leave from the Hankou Railway Station.\n\nIn 2006, construction began on the new Wuhan Railway Station with 11 platforms, located on the northeastern outskirts of the city. In December 2009, the station was opened, as China unveiled its second high-speed train with scheduled runs from Guangzhou to Wuhan. Billed as the fastest train in the world, it can reach a speed of 394 km/h (244.82 mph). The travel time between the two cities has been reduced from ten and a half hours to just three. The rail service has been extended north to Beijing.As of 2011, the new Wuhan Railway Station is primarily used by the Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed trains, while most regular trains to other destinations continue to use the Hankou and Wuchang stations.\n\nConstruction work is carried out on several lines of the new Wuhan Metropolitan Area Intercity Railway, which will eventually connect Wuhan's three main rail terminals with several stations throughout the city's outer areas and farther suburbs, as well as with the nearby cities of Xianning, Huangshi, Huanggang, and Xiaogan. The first line of the system, the one to Xianning, opened for passenger operations at the end of 2013. The line to Xiaogen opened on 1 December 2016 and it was extended with the opening of the Wuhan\u2013Shiyan high-speed railway to Shiyan on 29 November 2019.The main freight railway station and classification yard of the Wuhan metropolitan area is the extensive Wuhan North railway station, with 112 tracks and over 650 switches. It is located in Hengdian Subdistrict of Huangpi District, located 20 km (12 mi) north of the Wuhan Station and 23 km (14 mi) from Hankou Station.\n\n\n=== Wuhan Metro ===\n\nWuhan Metro is a rapid transit system serving the city of Wuhan.

Line 2 opened on 28 December 2012 and is the first underground metro line crossing the Yangtze River. With 1.22 billion annual passengers in 2019, Wuhan Metro is the sixth-busiest rapid transit system in mainland China. There are a number of lines or sections under construction. The government of Wuhan City promised the citizens that at least two lines or sections open every year. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire network was out of service from 23 January to 27 March 2020.\n\n\n=== Trams ===\n\nTrams were brought to the streets of Wuhan on July 28, 2017 with the first line (Auto-city T1 Line) opened that day. The trams under construction or planning in Wuhan are:\n\nAuto-city trams, with Lines T1, T2, T6, and T8 in the Wuhan Economic Development Area, in the far western reaches on Hanyang. T1 Line is operational as of 2017.\nOptics Valley trams, two lines  (T1 and T2) south and east of Guanggu Circle (Guanggu Guangchang) in southeastern Wuchang. The system opened on January 18, 2018.\nThe Old Hankou Streetcar, a loop line around Hankou city.\n\n\n=== Maritime transport ===\nWuhan is a major hub for maritime transport in central China.

It has also been selected as China's fourth international hub airport after Beijing Capital International Airport, Shanghai-Pudong and Guangzhou Baiyun. A second terminal was completed in March 2008, having been started in February 2005 with an investment of CNY 3.372 billion. International flights to neighboring Asian countries have also been enhanced, including direct flights to Tokyo and Nagoya, Japan. Terminal 3 has been available for service since early 2017.\nHannan Municipal Airport is an municipal airport that serves Hannan District.

In 2012 the Wuhan and Hangzhou Public Bicycle programs in China are the largest in the world, with around 90,000 and 60,000 bicycles respectively. China has seen a rise in private \"dockless\" bike shares with fleets that dwarf systems in size outside China. Initially, a number of traditional (third generation) docked public bike systems operated by local municipal governments opened across China, with the largest ones being in Wuhan and Hangzhou.  The first was introduced in Beijing in 2007.  However, third generation bike sharing is not considered successful for the majority cities in China.  Bike sharing in Beijing virtually stopped and it also has encountered difficulties in Shanghai and Wuhan.\n\n\n== Destinations ==\n\nThe Yellow Crane Tower (Huanghelou) is presumed to have been first built in approximately 220 AD. The tower has been destroyed and reconstructed numerous times, and was burned last according to some sources in 1884. The tower underwent complete reconstruction in 1981.

With a history of more than 2,000 years, Hubei cuisine, originating in ancient Chu cuisine, has developed a number of distinctive dishes, such as steamed blunt-snout bream in clear soup, preserved ham with flowering Chinese cabbage, and others. On the third day of the third month of the lunar calendar, many in Wuhan eat d\u00ecc\u00e0i zh\u01d4 j\u012bd\u00e0n (\u5730\u83dc\u716e\u9e21\u86cb), an egg dish which is supposed to prevent illness in the coming year.\"No need to be particular about the recipes; all foods have their own uses. Rice wine and tangyuan are excellent midnight snacks, while fat bream and flowering Chinese cabbages are great delicacies.\" This attitude expressed in Hankou Zhuzhici reflects indirectly the eating habits and a wide variety of distinctive snacks with a long history in Wuhan, such as Qingshuizong (a pyramid-shaped dumpling made of glutinous rice wrapped in bamboo or reed leaves) in the Period of the Warring States, Chunbinbian in Northern and Southern dynasties, mung bean jelly in the Sui dynasty, youguo (a deep-fried twisted dough stick) in the Song and Yuan dynasties, rice wine and mianwo in the Ming and Qing dynasties, as well as three-delicacy stuffed skin of bean milk, tangbao (steamed dumpling filled with minced meat and gravy) and hot braised noodles (reganmian) in modern times.\nGuozao (\u904e\u65e9) is a popular way to say 'having breakfast' in Wuhan, and a part of the city's culture. As a hub for land transport in China, Wuhan has gathered and mixed together various habits and customs from neighboring cities and provinces in all directions, which gives rise to a concentration of diverse cuisines from different places. The most famous place to guozao (have breakfast) is Hubu Street (\u6236\u90e8\u5df7), a 150-meter-long street in the neighborhood of Simenkou (\u53f8\u95e8\u53e3). Along its short length one can find nearly all the traditional foods of Wuhan, such as:\n\nHot and dry noodles, re-gan mian (\u70ed\u5e72\u9762), consists of long freshly boiled noodles mixed with sesame paste. It is considered to be the most typical local food for breakfast.\nDuck's neck or Ya Bozi (\u9e2d\u8116\u5b50) is a local version of this popular Chinese dish, made of duck necks and spices.\nBean skin or doupi (\u8c46\u76ae) is a local dish with a filling of egg, rice, beef, mushrooms and beans cooked between two large round soybean skins and cut into pieces, structurally like a stuffed pizza without enclosing edges.\nSoup dumpling or xiaolongtangbao (\u5c0f\u7b3c\u6c64\u5305) is a kind of dumpling with thin skin made of flour, steamed with very juicy meat inside, hence the name: tang (soup) bao (bun) \u2013 every time one takes a bite from it the \"soup\" inside is liable to spill out.\nA salty doughnut or mianwo (\u9eaa\u7aa9) is a kind of savory donut with a salty taste. It is much thinner than a common donut and is a typical Wuhan local food.\n\n\n=== Opera ===\nHan opera, which is the local opera of Wuhan area, was one of China's oldest and most popular operas. During the late Qing dynasty, Han opera, blended with Hui opera, gave birth to Peking opera, the most popular opera in modern China. Thus Han opera has been called the \"mother of Peking opera.\"\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nWuhan has a professional football team, Wuhan Zall F.C., that plays in the Chinese Super League. Xinhua Road Sport Center, the team's home stadium, with a capacity of 32,137, is located in the heart of the city next to Zhongshan Park. For the 2013 season, Wuhan Zall was promoted to the top-tier league of Chinese football, Chinese Super League, and relocated its home to Wuhan Sports Center Stadium, a modern stadium with 54,357 seats located in the suburbs of the city. However, the team did not play well in the ensuing season and was demoted back to China League One as the 2013 season ended. For financial and transportation reasons, the team moved back to Xinhua Road Sport Center in 2014.\nThe Wuhan Gators are a professional arena football team based in Wuhan. They are members of the China Arena Football League (CAFL).The 13,000-seat Wuhan Gymnasium held the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship and was one of the venues for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup. The 7th Military World Games were hosted in Wuhan from Oct. 18 to 27, 2019.The city has been the venue for the women's tennis tournament, the Wuhan Open, one of the WTA's Premier 5 tournaments, since 2014.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Bridges ===\n\nWuhan has eleven bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze River. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also called the First Bridge, was built over the Yangtze in 1957, carrying a railroad directly across the river between hills known as Snake Hill and Turtle Hill. Before this bridge was built it could take up to an entire day to barge railcars across. Including its approaches, it is 5,511 feet (1,680 m) long, and it accommodates both a double-track railway on a lower deck and a four-lane roadway above. It was built with the assistance of advisers from the Soviet Union.\nThe Second Bridge, a cable-stayed bridge built of prestressed concrete, has a central span of 400 meters (1,300 feet); it is 4,678 meters (15,348 feet) in length (including 1,877 meters (6,158 feet) of the main bridge) and 26.5 to 33.5 meters (86.9 to 109.9 feet) in width. Its main bridgeheads are 90 meters (300 feet) high each, pulling 392 thick slanting cables together in the shape of double fans so that the central span of the bridge is well poised on the piers and the bridge's stability and vibration resistance are ensured. With six lanes on the deck, the bridge is designed to handle the daily passage of 50,000 motor vehicles. The bridge was completed in 1995.\n\nThe Third Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also called Baishazhou Bridge, was completed in September 2000. Located 8.6 kilometers (5.3 miles) southwest of the First Bridge, construction of Baishazhou Bridge started in 1997. With an investment of over 1.4 billion yuan (about US$170,000,000), the bridge, which is 3,586 meters (11,765 feet) long and 26.5 meters (86.9 feet) wide, has six lanes and has a capacity of 50,000 vehicles a day. The bridge is expected to serve as a major passage for the future Wuhan Ring Road, greatly easing the city's traffic and aiding local economic development.\nThe Yangluo Bridge carries Wuhan's Ring Road across the Yangtze in the city's eastern suburbs (connecting the Hongshan District with the Xinzhou District). It was opened on December 26, 2007.\nThe Wuhan Tianxingzhou Yangtze River Bridge crosses the Yangtze in the northeastern part of the city, downstream of the Second bridge. It is named after Tianxing Island (Tianxingzhou), above which it crosses the river. Built at a cost of 11 billion yuan, the 4,657-meter cable suspension bridge was opened on December 26, 2009, in time for the opening of the Wuhan Railway Station. It is a combined road and rail bridge, and carries the Wuhan\u2013Guangzhou High-Speed Railway across the river.\n\n\n=== Skyscrapers ===\n\nThe Yellow Crane Tower, historically one of the tallest buildings in Wuhan, is considered one of the Four Great Towers of China and was destroyed twelve times, both by warfare and by fire. The tower is classified as an AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration. At 438 meters (1,437 ft) in height, the Wuhan Center skyscraper, the tallest structure in Wuhan and in Central China, is the eighth tallest structure in China. The Minsheng Bank Building, the second tallest structure in Wuhan, was the tallest building in Wuhan when it was completed in 2007. It retained the title until Wuhan Center surpassed it in 2014. Wuhan World Trade Tower is a 273-meter (896 foot) tall skyscraper located in Wuhan. It became the tallest building in Wuhan after its completion in 1998. However, it was surpassed by the Minsheng Bank Building in 2007.\nThe Wuhan Greenland Center is a planned 636-meter (2,087 ft), 126-floor mixed-use skyscraper currently under construction and scheduled for completion in 2019. If completed as planned, it will be among the world's tallest structures, and one of the world's tallest buildings by occupiable floor height. The Phoenix Towers are proposed supertall skyscrapers planned for construction in Wuhan. At 1 kilometer (3,300 ft) high, the towers would also be among the tallest structures in the world when completed.\n\n\n== Notable Wuhanese ==\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nLi Yuanhong \u2013 former President of the Republic of China (1916\u201317, 1922\u201323).\nWu Yi \u2013 former Vice-Premier and Minister of Health of the People's Republic of China\n\n\n=== Business ===\nWei Brian - Chinese entrepreneur\n\n\n=== Science ===\nChang-Lin Tien \u2013 seventh Chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley (1990\u20131997) and a major founder of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering (NAE).

        "wiki": "The COVID-19 pandemic, which started in the city of Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, has led to an increase in acts and displays of sinophobia as well as prejudice, xenophobia, discrimination, violence, and racism against people of East Asian and Southeast Asian descent and appearance around the world. With the spread of the pandemic and formation of hotspots, such as those in Asia, Europe, and the Americas, discrimination against people from these hotspots has been reported. The incidents also led to increase in acts and displays of islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia and antisemitism.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Zika virus, but in 2015 the World Health Organization introduced recommendations to avoid this practice, in order to reduce stigma. In accordance with this policy, the WHO recommended the official name \"COVID-19\" in February 2020.In early coverage of the outbreak, some news sources associated the virus with China in a way that contributed to stigma. The journal Nature later published an apology for this type of coverage. However, even after the majority of politicians had switched to avoiding stigmatizing language when referring to the virus, a minority continued.\n\n\n== Africa ==\n\n\n=== Cameroon ===\nThe US embassy in Yaound\u00e9 issued a travel warning to US citizens amid reports of \"...verbal and online harassment, stone throwing, and banging on vehicles occupied by expatriates.\"\n\n\n=== Egypt ===\nAccording to the Embassy of Japan in Cairo, store clerks have been hesitating to serve Japanese customers, and \"corona\" has also become a new slur with which to abuse Japanese people on the street.On 10 March 2020, an Uber driver was arrested after a viral video showing the driver forcibly removing his Chinese passenger at a highway in Cairo's Maadi district on suspicion of having the virus. In the video, a voice is heard in the video jokingly shouting \"The first coronavirus case in Egypt!\" and the same voice then tells the driver \"May God support you, Hajji! Throw him out!\". The incident has sparked outrage among Egyptians after the video was uploaded. Some Egyptians visited the Chinese man in his hotel and expressed an apology to him for the incident, widely condemned in the local media as an act of bullying and racism.\n\n\n=== Ethiopia ===\nViolence towards foreigners has been reported amidst the pandemic, with some locals attacking foreigners on social media by publishing photos of them and linking them to the coronavirus. The Foreign Correspondents Association of Ethiopia had warned that \"dangerous rumours\" and \"vicious posts\" were being spread on the internet about foreign journalists, while other foreigners had been physically attacked.\n\n\n=== Kenya ===\nA video reportedly recorded in Kibera, Kenya shows an angry crowd threatening a man and woman of East Asian descent about the coronavirus. A man in the crowd shouts at the frightened couple, \"You are corona!\" A motorcycle rider from the crowd later raised his hand threatening to slap the Asian man. The couple looked angry and therefore started swearing in Chinese towards the crowd before the video ended. Growing unease towards Chinese immigrants has been reported in the streets of Nairobi and its environment especially towards construction workers.An alleged Kenyan member of parliament posted in a Facebook message that his constituents had the right to stone and chase away any Chinese visitors who were not quarantined. A Kenyan taxi driver told BBC that Chinese nationals had been changing their user names on taxi hailing apps to avoid their passenger request being declined.\n\n\n=== Nigeria ===\nGeopolitical analyst Ovigwe Eguegu reported that \"a plethora of conspiracy theories, and videos of Asians (some Chinese) eating bats, and other exotic animals\" on Nigerian social media has led to increased Sinophobia.\n\n\n=== South Africa ===\n\nAn ethnic Chinese man in Johannesburg told Deutsche Welle that violent comments such as \"wipe the Chinese people out\" and \"hope this virus gets all of them\" etc. have been expressed in the country by locals.\n\n\n== Asia ==\n\n\n=== Bangladesh ===\nThe Bangladeshi government has sent dozens of Rohingya refugees, who had remained stranded at sea for several weeks, to Bhasan Char, an uninhabited island in the estuary of the Meghna river. Hundreds more remain stranded on two overcrowded trawlers between Bangladesh and Malaysia. Human rights groups have criticised the Bangladeshi and Malaysian governments for using the coronavirus pandemic as a pretext to send away refugees.\n\n\n=== China ===\n\nAccording to World Journal, there have been instances of Wuhan natives in other provinces being turned away from hotels, having their ID numbers, home addresses and telephone numbers deliberately leaked online or dealing with harassing phone calls from strangers. Some places also reportedly had signs saying \"people from Wuhan and cars from Hubei are not welcomed here.\" Multiple hotels purportedly refused to check-in a Wuhan tour guide after she returned to Hangzhou from Singapore with one of them calling the police to give her a health check and asking the police to quarantine her. Amidst these incidents, various cities and prefectures outside of Hubei adopted resettlement measures for Hubei people in their region such as designated hotel accommodation for visitors from the province. In Zhengding, Jingxing and Luquan of Shijiazhuang City, the local governments rewarded anyone who reported those who had been to Wuhan, but not recorded in official documents at least 1,000 yuan RMB. In Meizhou, residents reporting people entering from Hunan were awarded 30 face masks.It was reported that on a scheduled 27 January China Southern Airlines flight from Nagoya to Shanghai, some Shanghainese travellers refused to board with 16 others from Wuhan. Two of the Wuhan travellers were unable to board due to a fever while the Shanghainese on the spot alleged that the others had taken medicine to bypass the temperature check. One of the Wuhan tourists protested on Weibo, \"are they really my countrymen?\" which a Shanghai tourist who was purportedly at the scene replied that they did it to protect Shanghai from the virus. Many netizens criticized the Wuhan tourists for travelling with a fever, although some also called for understanding and for Shanghainese not to regionally discriminate.In March and April 2020, media outlets  reported instances of xenophobia towards foreigners, although The Globe and Mail have reported that Chinese officials deny the existence of any such discrimination within China. It has been attributed to fears of a second wave of the coronavirus, although the Chinese vice-foreign minister noted that 90% of imported COVID-19 cases were PRC nationals returning from overseas. According to The Telegraph, foreigners are being barred from hotels, supermarkets, and restaurants, while others have had their visas cancelled and reentry into China barred. The Guardian reported on 29 March of foreigners being shouted at by local residents, avoided in public places, and sometimes scolded as \"foreign trash\". Shanghaiist has referenced stories of foreigner misbehaviour circulating on the Chinese internet as playing a role in the increased xenophobia. A comic posted on Weibo depicts people in hazmat suits disinfecting foreigners and throwing them in waste bins.In April 2020, several reports emerged in Guangzhou of African nationals being evicted from their homes by local police and told to leave, with no place to sleep, amidst some recent Chinese news articles negatively reporting on Nigerians in the city. The reports of discrimination created controversy in Africa damaging Sino-African relations, and sparked a diplomatic crisis, with African governments and diplomats speaking out against the incidents in Guangzhou. The Nigerian legislator Oloye Akin Alabi posted a video of his confronting the PRC's ambassador Zhou Pingjian over the alleged mistreatment of Nigerians in the city. The governments of Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda have also asked for explanations from the PRC government, and the African Union Commission invited the PRC ambassador to the African Union to discuss the mistreatment allegations. The African ambassadors summarised the complaints in an official protest letter demanding the cessation of reported ejection from hotels or apartments, forced testing and quarantine, the seizure of passports, and threats of visa revocation, arrest or deportation of Africans particularly in the Guangdong province. The US Consulate General in Guangzhou has advised African Americans against traveling to Guangzhou due to ethnic tensions.\n\n\n=== Hong Kong ===\nMore than 100 restaurants in Hong Kong have turned away customers from mainland China, with one restaurant demanding that a customer produce a Hong Kong identity card to prove they were not from the mainland. Tenno Ramen, a Japanese noodle restaurant in Hung Hom, refused to serve mainland Chinese customers. The restaurant said on Facebook, \"We want to live longer. We want to safeguard local customers. Please excuse us.\" Another example is Kwong Wing Catering, a pro-2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests restaurant chain, which announced on Facebook on 28 January 2020 that it would only serve English or Cantonese-speaking but not Mandarin-speaking customers since the government did not implement a border closure against mainland Chinese.  However, Mandarin is also the common tongue in Taiwan, so the said Facebook post was then updated a day later to clarify that they welcome Taiwanese customers.\n\n\n=== Indonesia ===\nThe Foreign Policy reported that \"On social media, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram posts encourage people to stay away from places where Chinese citizens or Chinese-heritage Indonesians work and live. ... Major media outlets are also complicit in spreading anti-Chinese conspiracies.\"A demonstration was staged outside a hotel in Bukittinggi, rejecting the visit of tourists from Southern China who stayed there amid fear of coronavirus. The demonstrators demanded that the tourists be isolated in an airport, and showed distrust over screening tools in airports. It ended after police guaranteed that the tourists would stay in the hotel up to the following day, when the tourists depart from the city.In a press release, the embassy of Japan in Indonesia stated that incidents of discrimination and harassment toward Japanese people had increased in the midst of the pandemic, and announced they had set up a help center to assist Japanese residents dealing with these incidents. In general, there have been reports of widespread anti-Japanese discrimination and harassment in the country, with hotels, stores, restaurants, taxi services and more refusing Japanese customers, and many Japanese people were no longer allowed in meetings and conferences. The embassy of Japan has also received at least a dozen reports of harassment toward Japanese people in just a few days. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan) stated that anti-Japanese discrimination was on the increase in the country.\n\n\n=== India ===\n\nIndian Islamic cleric Ilyas Sharafuddin said in an audio address that the coronavirus outbreak was a \"punishment of Allah on China for mistreating Uighur Muslims\". Ilyas said that \"they [the Chinese] have threatened the Muslims and tried to destroy lives of 20 million Muslims. Muslims were forced to drink alcohol, their mosques were destroyed and their Holy Book was burned. They thought that no one can challenge them, but Allah the most powerful punished them.\" He added that \"Romans, Persians, and Russians who were arrogant and stood against Islam,\" were all destroyed by Allah.Northeast Indian students in Kirori Mal College, Delhi, have filed a complaint to college authorities about harassment in the hands of other students over the fears of coronavirus. Eight students from Northeast India at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai also alleged that they were subjected to racism and harassment.The Bharatiya Janata Party's State unit president in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh stated that the Chinese had \"destroyed nature\" and \"that's why the God took revenge against them.\" The remarks were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling them \"erroneous.\"In March 2020, foreigners from Europe, US and Israel started facing xenophobia and discrimination, including evictions from rented homes.Muslim gatherings organised by the Tablighi Jamaat has resulted in large increased of cases in India, which has triggered Islamophobic reactions and increased communal tension.

The Israeli military announced its intention to quarantine some 200 South Korean nationals to a military base. Many of the remaining South Koreans were rejected by hotels and were forced to spend nights at Ben Gurion Airport. An Israeli newspaper subsequently published a Korean complaint that \"Israel is Treating [Korean and other Asian] Tourists Like Coronavirus\". Public health expert Dr. Hagai Levine said that Israeli politicians may be overreaching to impress voters.On 14 March 2020, an Indian man from the Bnei Menashe community was attacked and beaten by several unidentified individuals in Tiberias  who called him \"Chinese\" and \"Corona\".

          "I don't want to give too many things away because everything was unbelievably awesome. However, if you like Ballet, you will love this, if you don't like ballet I suspect you'll also love this because of the water scenes. We sat in block B which was great but knowing what I know",
          "Hi! I was rather disappointed with this show. It has quoted dark colors . It is rather costly 40-50 dollars for tickets. I have seen a much better show at the Wrens Nest in Beijing. Considering you are in Wuhan, this is pretty good. The swimmers and divers are very good.",
          "I think the best way to tackle this is not to read the reviews and go totally unprepared because the spectacle is incredible. One of those things that you really enjoy at the time but not a lasting cultural experience.",

          "I think this show is somewhat on the decline as there wasn't a lot of people watching it on a Sunday evening. I reckon 3/4 of the audience watched it for free as part of some corporate activity. When I was there, the 600 zone priced at 600+ yuan was sold at 300+ yuan so I got a",
          "This was an unexpected bonus on a Sinorama trip. Not originally scheduled, we only learned we were going when the tour guide handed out our tickets (no charge) on the bus into Wuhan. Impossible to describe this in mere words that would explain even remotely what the show is",
          "This is without a doubt one of the very best shows of its type I have ever seen. The effects \u2013 visual, auditory and water are extraordinary, and compliment the fantastic acrobatics. The theater is huge yet some how the show fills it. I suggest sitting up a bit from the stage",
          "Incredible show!! A must see if you are in Wuhan. It's like the Cirque du Solei multiplied by ten!!!!",

          "It's was a very impressive and great show. The price might be quite high for the good seats. But getting the cheapest seats is worth it. It is definitely a show that must watch when you visit WuHan. The overall experience is excellent. Just be prepare to get slightly wet if you",

          "From the moment the seats to the side of the stage move outwards to allow the front seats to recede, revealing a hidden pool, the whole show is spectacular and thrilling. If you have a chance you simply must see this show, words alone cannot do it justice. The infrastructure",
          "I was in China as part of a Sinorama tour and we went to several shows of varying enjoyment. Without a doubt this was the best of the bunch, its like Cirque de soleil on water, I saw things I have never seen on TV or live before and was very impressed, the skills of the",

          "I see others' comments here, outstanding, breathtaking, superlative, etc. I agree. But superlatives do not do this place justice. There are only two of these shows in China, one in Wuhan and one in Macao. The buildings were constructed solely for this hour-long, uninterrupted",

        "wiki": "Wuhan University of Technology (WUT or WHUT), located in Wuchang District and Luonan Subdistrict, Hongshan District in Wuhan, Hubei, was merged on May 27, 2000, from three universities: Wuhan University of Technology (established in 1948), Wuhan Transportation University (established in 1946) and Wuhan Automotive Polytechnic University (established in 1958). WUT is one of the leading Chinese universities accredited by the Ministry of Education and one of the universities constructed in priority by the \"State Project 211\" for Chinese higher education institutions. It is also a Chinese Ministry of Education Double First Class Discipline University, with Double First Class status in certain disciplines.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nWuhan University of Technology (WUT) was founded on May 27, 2000 from the former Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan Transportation University and Wuhan Automotive Polytechnic University. Each of these three universities has its own uniquely important history.\nThe former Wuhan University of Technology dated back from three colleges, namely, Zhongnan Construction Engineering College in 1952, Shenyang Building Materials Industry College in 1958 and Beijing Institute of Building Engineering in 1958. Then in 1971, Beijing Institute of Building Engineering merged with Wuhan Construction Engineering School and thus formed Hubei Construction Industry College. Later in 1978, the college was awarded the title as national key university and then changed its name to Wuhan Institute of Building Materials. In 1985, the college changed its name to Wuhan University of Technology, which later passed the evaluation of \"State 211 Project\" in 1996 and entered into the direct administration of the Ministry of Education in 1998 before its merge with the other two universities in May 2000.\nThe former Wuhan Transportation University mainly originated from National Maritime Vocational School in 1946. Then in 1949, the college changed its name to Wuhan Transportation College. in 1952, the college changed its name to Wuhan River Transportation College. Later in 1957, the college changed its name to Wuhan University of  Water Transportation Engineering which then received the discipline adjustment by the Ministry of Transportation in 1963. More importantly, the college merged with Wuhan River Transportation School and thus got its name as Wuhan University of  Water Transportation Engineering. Later in 1993, the college was officially named as Wuhan Transportation University by the Ministry of Transportation before its merge with the other two universities in May 2000.\nThe former Wuhan Automotive Polytechnic University came from the original Wuhan Institute of Technology which was founded in 1958. In 1959, it was merged into Hubei Chemical Engineering College. Then in 1961, the college merged with the other two colleges, respectively, Wuhan Institute of Technology and Hubei Industry College and thus named itself Wuhan Institute of Technology. During the next fifteen years, the Institute underwent great changes and was forced to change its name due to China's Cultural Revolution. Then in 1979, the Institute regained its name as Wuhan Institute of Technology. Later from 1983 to 1994, the Institute showed its rapid development in many aspects. Then in 1995, the Institute changed its name to Wuhan Automotive Polytechnic University. What was more, in 1999, Hubei No.1 Mechanical Industry School and Hubei Energy Economy School were merged into the university. Later in May 2000, it merged with the other two universities mentioned in the beginning and thus formed Wuhan University of Technology.\n\n\n== Academic ==\nCurrently, the university owns 23 academic schools, 9 state key disciplines, 74 Doctoral programs, 135 Master's programs as well as 82 Bachelor's programs. WUT has about 5,570 staff members, including 650 professors, 3 academicians of China Academy of Engineering and 3 academicians of China Academy of Science.  Besides, over 36,000 undergraduates, 16000 postgraduates (including Master and PhD students), and 327 international students are studying at WUT.\nThe university has extensively established academic links with more than sixty external universities and institutions. The university has engaged more than one hundred famous foreign scholars as Concurrent or Honorary Professors for the university, and often receives experts, scholars and professors from other countries or regions to teach or do research. The university also sends abroad a number of teachers, professors, and scholars to study and to attend international academic conferences each year. Some of them have been engaged as Guest Professor, Special Professor or Lecturer by foreign host institutions. In 1950 the university began to admit foreign students and has awarded more than ten different countries\u2019 students ever since with a bachelor, master's degree or a certificate for further study.\n\n\n=== Schools ===\n\nSchool of Materials Science and Engineering\nSchool of Automotive Engineering\nSchool of Transportation\nSchool of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering\nSchool of Energy and Power Engineering\nSchool of Resources and Environmental Engineering\nSchool of Information Engineering\nSchool of Computer Science and Technology\nSchool of Automation\nSchool of Civil Engineering and Architecture\nSchool of Navigation\nSchool of Logistics Engineering\nSchool of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Life Science\nSchool of Sciences\nSchool of Management\nSchool of Economics\nSchool of Law, Humanities and Sociology\nSchool of Art and Design\nSchool of Foreign Languages\nInstitute of Higher Education\nSchool of Vocational Technology\nSchool of International Education\nSchool of On-line and Continuing Education\nDepartment of Physical Education\n\n\n=== Research ===\n\nWUT possesses 27 innovative research centers with international leading level including two State Key Laboratories, a State Engineering Laboratory and provincial or ministerial level laboratories in the areas of new materials, new energy, transportation and logistics, mechatronics and automobile, information technology as well as resources and environmental technology.  In recent 10 years, WUT has obtained nearly RMB 3 billion of funding from government and industrial sectors for high-tech research and development, and has made a lot of innovative and important technological achievements. Meanwhile, the University has established its Science Park in Wuhan\u00b7China Optical Valley, covering an area of 58.7 hectares, where it has incubated and fostered more than 6 high-tech enterprises based on new materials, fiber optical sensors, high-speed shipping, new energy technology and advanced manufacturing. In 2010, the total revenue of the Science Park reached RMB1.58 billion.\nWUT has formed three important Boards of Directors with the industrial sectors of building materials and construction industry, transportation industry and automobile industry, totally covering 167 large backbone enterprises. The Boards of Directors hold annual meetings regularly to discuss the important issues concerning the mutual development between the university and the three industrial sectors. Meanwhile, WUT has established cooperative relations for students exchange and scientific research with more than 100 foreign universities and research institutions from USA, UK, Japan, France, Australia, Russia and the Netherlands, etc. and invited over 200 international famous scholars to be guest professors or honorary professors.\nIn 2006 and 2007, the State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs and the Ministry of Education made a joint approval of establishing a state base in WUT for discipline innovation and talent import in the field of advanced materials technology and high-speed shipping technology. In 2008, the Ministry of Science and Technology approved WUT to establish an internationally joint research center for advanced materials technology. In 2010,  Thermoelectric Materials Research Team of WUT Entered China-US Clean Energy Joint Research Centre.\nThere is a partnership between the University of Wales Trinity Saint David and the Wuhan University of Technology.\n\n\n== Campus ==\n\nWuhan University of Technology (WUT) is located in Wuhan, the largest city in Central China and a Chinese famous \"River City\". The university has three main campuses, namely, the Mafangshan Campus \u9a6c\u623f\u5c71 (which is divided into East Campus Community and West Campus Community), the Yujiatou Campus and the South Lake new Campus, with a total occupying land area of 267 hectares. Bordering the South Lake, the new university is situated on the south bank of Yangtze River in Wuhan. It has two main campuses, one at Mafangshan Hill and one at Yujiatou in Wuchang. The total area of the campus is 450 acres (1.8 km\u00b2). WUT has a building floorage of 1,100,000 square meters and it possesses three libraries with a stock of 2,720,000 books.\n\n\n== Rankings ==\nWuhan University of Technology ranked 39th in Wu Shulian's university ranking in 2008, one of the most popular university ranking in China. This placed it third among universities in Wuhan, after Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Wuhan University.\nAccording to the world university rankings 2013 by Times Higher Education, Wuhan University of Technology ranked 58th in Asian (8th in P.R. China and between 301st to 350th in the world.).\nIn the inaugural BRICS & Emerging Economies Rankings 2014, Wuhan University of Technology was ranked 28th overall and 9th in China, thus becoming the best ranked university in the city of Wuhan.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website\nView in Google Earth",

        "wiki": "Wuhan (simplified Chinese: \u6b66\u6c49; traditional Chinese: \u6b66\u6f22, [\u00f9.x\u00e2n] (listen)) is the capital city of Hubei Province in the People's Republic of China. It is the largest city in Hubei and the most populous city in Central China, with a population of over 11 million, the ninth most populous Chinese city and one of the nine National Central Cities of China.The name \"Wuhan\" came from the city's historical origin from the conglomeration of Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang, which are collectively known as the \"Three Towns of Wuhan\" (\u6b66\u6c49\u4e09\u9547).  It lies in the eastern Jianghan Plain, at the confluence of the Yangtze river and its largest tributary, the Han River and is known as \"Nine Provinces' Thoroughfare\" (\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862).Wuhan is considered by some to be one of the potential sites of the pivotal Battle of the Red Cliffs, which stopped warlord Cao Cao's incursion into southern China at the end of the Eastern Han dynasty. Other historical events taking place in Wuhan include the Wuchang Uprising of 1911, which led to the downfall of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China. Wuhan was briefly the capital of China in 1927 under the left wing of the Kuomintang (KMT) government led by Wang Jingwei. The city later served as the wartime capital of China for ten months in 1937 during the Second Sino-Japanese War. A novel coronavirus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic was first identified in Wuhan in December 2019.Wuhan is considered the political, economic, financial, commercial, cultural and educational center of Central China. It is a major transportation hub, with dozens of railways, roads and expressways passing through the city and connecting to other major cities. Because of its key role in domestic transportation, Wuhan is sometimes referred to as \"the Chicago of China\" by foreign sources. The \"Golden Waterway\" of the Yangtze River and the Han River traverse the urban area and divide Wuhan into the three districts of Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge crosses the Yangtze in the city. The Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest power station in terms of installed capacity, is located nearby. Historically, Wuhan has suffered risks of flooding, prompting the government to alleviate the situation by introducing ecologically friendly absorption mechanisms.While Wuhan has been a traditional manufacturing hub for decades, it is also one of the areas promoting modern industrial changes in China. Wuhan consists of three national development zones, four scientific and technological development parks, over 350 research institutes, 1,656 high tech enterprises, numerous enterprise incubators and investments from 230 Fortune Global 500 firms. It produced GDP of US$22.4 billion in 2018. The Dongfeng Motor Corporation, an automobile manufacturer, is headquartered in Wuhan. The city is home to multiple notable institutes of higher education, including Wuhan University and the Huazhong University of Science and Technology. In 2017, Wuhan was designated as a Creative City by UNESCO, in the field of design. Wuhan is classified as a Beta world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Wuhan\" is a portmanteau of the two major cities on the northern and southern banks of the Yangtze River that make up the Wuhan metropolis: \"Wu\" refers to the city of Wuchang (Chinese: \u6b66\u660c), which lies on the southern bank of the Yangtze, while \"Han\" refers to the city of Hankou (Chinese: \u6c49\u53e3), which lies on the northern bank of the Yangtze.\nIn 1926, the Northern Expedition reached the Wuhan area and it was decided to merge Hankou, Wuchang and Hanyang into one city in order to make a new capital for Nationalist China. On January 1, 1927, the resulting city was proclaimed as '\u6b66\u6f22' (the traditional Chinese characters for 'Wuhan'), which was later simplified as '\u6b66\u6c49' (also 'Wuhan').\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nThe Wuhan area has been settled for 3,500 years. Panlongcheng, an archaeological site primarily associated with the Erligang culture (c. 1510 \u2013 c. 1460 BC) (being sparsely populated during the earlier Erlitou period), is located in modern-day Huangpi District.\nDuring the Western Zhou the State of E, which gives its name to the single character abbreviation for Hubei province, controlled the present-day Wuchang area south of the Yangtze River. After the conquest of the E state in 863 BC, the present-day Wuhan area was controlled by the State of Chu for the rest of the Western Zhou and Eastern Zhou periods.  Chu was in turn conquered by Qin in 223 BCE.\n\n\n=== Imperial China ===\n\nDuring the Han dynasty, Hanyang became a fairly busy port. The Battle of Xiakou in AD 203 and Battle of Jiangxia five years later were fought over control of Jiangxia Commandery (present-day Xinzhou District in northeast Wuhan). In the winter of 208/9, one of the most famous battles in Chinese history and a central event in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms\u2014the Battle of Red Cliffs\u2014took place near the Yangtze River, with the cliffs near Wuhan identified as one of the potential locations. Around that time, walls were built to protect Hanyang (AD 206) and Wuchang (AD 223). The latter event marks the foundation of Wuhan. In AD 223, the Yellow Crane Tower, one of the Four Great Towers of China, was constructed on the Wuchang side of the Yangtze River by order of Sun Quan, leader of the Eastern Wu. The tower become a sacred site of Taoism.Due to tensions between the Eastern Wu and Cao Wei kingdoms, in the autumn of 228, Cao Rui, grandson of Cao Cao and the second emperor of the state of Cao Wei, ordered the general Man Chong to lead troops to Xiakou (\u590f\u53e3; in present-day Wuhan). In 279, Wang Jun and his army conquered strategic locations in Wu territory such as Xiling (in present-day Yichang, Hubei), Xiakou (\u590f\u53e3; present-day Hankou) and Wuchang (\u6b66\u660c; present-day Ezhou, Hubei).\nDuring the Northern and Southern dynasties period, the Wuhan area was part of the successive Southern dynasty states Liu Song (420\u2013479), Southern Qi (479\u2013502), Liang, and Western Liang.\nIn fall 550, Hou Jing sent Ren Yue to attack both Xiao Daxin and Xiao Fan's son Xiao Si (\u856d\u55e3).  Ren killed Xiao Si in battle, and Xiao Daxin, unable to resist, surrendered, allowing Hou to take his domain under control.  Meanwhile, Xiao Guan, who had by now settled at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan), was planning to attack Hou, but this drew Xiao Yi's ire\u2014believing that Xiao Guan was intending to contend for the throne\u2014and he sent Wang to attack Xiao Guan. In summer 567, Chen Xu commissioned Wu Mingche as the governor of Xiang Province and had him command a major part of the troops against Hua, along with Chunyu Liang (\u6df3\u4e8e\u91cf). The opposing sides met at Zhuankou (\u6c8c\u53e3, in modern Wuhan).\nThe city has long been renowned as a center for the arts (especially poetry) and for intellectual studies. Cui Hao, a celebrated poet of the Tang dynasty, visited the Yellow Crane Tower in the early 8th century; his poem made it the most celebrated building in southern China.In spring 877, Wang Xianzhi captured E Prefecture (\u9102\u5dde, in modern Wuhan).  He then returned north, joining forces with Huang again, and they surrounded Song Wei at Song Prefecture (\u5b8b\u5dde, in modern Shangqiu, Henan).  In winter 877, Huang Chao pillaged Qi and Huang (\u9ec3\u5dde, in modern Wuhan) Prefectures.\nBefore Kublai Khan arrived in 1259, word reached him that M\u00f6ngke had died. Kublai decided to keep the death of his brother secret and continued the attack on the Wuhan area, near the Yangtze. The present-day Wuying Pagoda was constructed at the end of the Song Dynasty between attacks by the Mongolian forces.  Under the Mongol rulers (Yuan dynasty) (after 1301), the Wuchang prefecture, headquartered in the town, became the capital of Hubei province. Hankou, from the Ming to late Qing, was under the administration of the local government in Hanyang, although it was already one of the four major national markets (zh:\u56db\u5927\u540d\u9547) of the Ming dynasty.\nHanyang's Guiyuan Temple was completed in the 15th year of Shunzhi (1658).By the dawn of the 18th century, Hankou had become one of China's top four most important towns of trade. In the late 19th century, railroads were extended on a north\u2013south axis through the city, making Wuhan an important transshipment point between rail and river traffic. Also during this period foreign powers extracted mercantile concessions, with the riverfront of Hankou being divided up into foreign-controlled merchant districts. These districts contained trading firm offices, warehouses, and docking facilities. The French had a concession in Hankou. During the Taiping Rebellion, the Wuhan area was controlled for many years by rebel forces and the Yellow Crane Tower, Xingfu Temple, Zhuodaoquan Temple and other buildings were repurposed or damaged. During the Second Opium War (known in the West as the Arrow War, 1856\u20131860), the government of the Qing dynasty was defeated by the western powers and signed the Treaties of Tianjin and the Convention of Peking, which stipulated eleven cities or regions (including Hankou) as trading ports. In December 1858, James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, High Commissioner to China, led four warships up the Yangtze River in Wuhan to collect the information needed for opening the trading port in Wuhan.\nIn the spring of 1861, Counselor Harry Parkes and Admiral Herbert were sent to Wuhan to open a trading port. On the basis of the Convention of Peking, Harry Parkes concluded the Hankou Lend-Lease Treaty with Guan Wen, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei. It brought an area of 30.53 square kilometers (11.79 sq mi) along the Yangtze River (from latter-day Jianghan Road to Hezuo Road) to become a British Concession and permitted Britain to set up its consulate in the concession.\n\nIn 1889, Zhang Zhidong was transferred from Viceroy of Liangguang (Guangdong and Guangxi provinces) to Viceroy of Huguang (Hunan and Hubei provinces). He governed the province for 18 years, until 1907. During this period, he elucidated the theory of \"Chinese learning as the basis, Western learning for application,\" known as the ti-yong ideal. He set up many heavy industries, founded Hanyang Steel Plant, Daye Iron Mine, Pingxiang Coal Mine and Hubei Arsenal and set up local textile industries, boosting the flourishing modern industry in Wuhan. Meanwhile, he initiated education reform, opened dozens of modern educational organizations successively, such as Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) Academy of Classical Learning, Civil General Institute, Military General Institute, Foreign Languages Institute and Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) General Normal School, and selected a great many students for study overseas, which well promoted the development of China's modern education. Furthermore, he trained a modern military and organized a modern army including a zhen and a xie (both zhen and xie are military units in the Qing dynasty) in Hubei.\nOriginally known as the Hubei Arsenal, the Hanyang Arsenal was founded in 1891 by Qing official Zhang Zhidong, who diverted funds from the Nanyang Fleet in Guangdong to build the arsenal. It cost about 250,000 pounds sterling and was built in 4 years. On 23 April 1894, construction was completed and the arsenal, occupying some 40 acres (160,000 m2), could start production of small-caliber cannons. It built magazine-fed rifles, Gruson quick fire guns, and cartridges.\n\n\n==== Wuchang Uprising ====\n\nBy 1900, according to Collier's magazine, Hankau, the Yangtze River boom town, was \"the St. Louis and Chicago of China.\" On October 10, 1911, Sun Yat-sen's followers launched the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the collapse of the Qing dynasty, as well as the establishment of the Chinese Republic.The Wuchang Uprising of October 1911, which overthrew the Qing dynasty, originated in Wuhan. Before the uprising, anti-Qing secret societies were active in Wuhan. In September 1911, the outbreak of the protests in Sichuan forced the Qing authorities to send part of the New Army garrisoned in Wuhan to suppress the rebellion. On September 14 the Literary Society (\u6587\u5b78\u793e) and the Progressive Association (\u5171\u9032\u6703), two local revolutionary organizations in Hubei, set up joint headquarters in Wuchang and planned for an uprising. On the morning of October 9, a bomb at the office of the political arrangement exploded prematurely and alerted local authorities. The proclamation for the uprising, beadroll and the revolutionaries\u2019 official seal fell into the hands of Rui Cheng, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei, who demolished the uprising headquarters the same day and set out to arrest the revolutionaries listed in the beadroll. This forced the revolutionaries to launch the uprising earlier than planned.On the night of October 10, the revolutionaries fired shots to signal the uprising at the engineering barracks of Hubei New Army. They then led the New Army of all barracks to join the revolution. Under the guidance of Wu Zhaolin, Cai Jimin and others, this revolutionary army seized the official residence of the governor and government offices. Rui Cheng fled in panic into the Chuyu ship. Zhang Biao, the commander of the Qing army, also fled the city. On the morning of the 11th, the revolutionary army took the whole city of Wuchang, but leaders such as Jiang Yiwu and Sun Wu disappeared. Thus the leaderless revolutionary army recommended Li Yuanhong, the assistant governor of the Qing army, as the commander-in-chief. Li founded the Hubei Military Government, proclaimed the abolition of the Qing rule in Hubei, the founding of the Republic of China and published an open telegram calling for other provinces to join the revolution.As the revolution spread to other parts of the country, the Qing government concentrated loyalist military forces to suppress the uprising in Wuhan. From October 17 to December 1, the revolutionary army and local volunteers defended the city in the Battle of Yangxia against better armed and more numerous Qing forces commanded by Yuan Shikai. Huang Xing would arrive in Wuhan in early November to take command of the revolutionary army. After fierce fighting and heavy casualties, Qing forces seized Hankou and Hanyang. But Yuan agreed to halt the advance on Wuchang and participated in peace talks, which would eventually lead to the return of Sun Yat-sen from exile, founding of the Republic of China on January 1, 1912. Through the Wuchang Uprising, Wuhan is known as the birthplace of the Xinhai Revolution, named after the Xinhai year on the Chinese calendar. The city has several museums and memorials to the revolution and the thousands of martyrs who died defending the revolution.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\n\nWith the northern extension of the Northern Expedition, the center of the Great Revolution shifted from the Pearl River basin to the Yangtze River basin. On November 26, the Kuomintang Central Political Committee decided to move the capital from Guangzhou to Wuhan. In mid-December, most of the KMT central executive commissioners and national government commissioners arrived in Wuhan, set up the temporary joint conference of central executive commissioners and National Government commissioners, performed the top functions of central party headquarters and National Government, declared they would work in Wuhan on January 1, 1927, and decided to combine the towns of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang into Wuhan City, called \"Capital District\". The new national government, later known as \"Wuhan nationalist government\", was based in the Nanyang Building in Hankou, while the central party headquarters and other organizations chose their locations in Hankou or Wuchang.In March 1927, Mao Zedong appeared at the Third Plenum of the KMT Central Executive Committee in Wuhan, which sought to strip General Chiang of his power by appointing Wang Jingwei leader. The first phase of the Northern Expedition was interrupted by the political split in the Kuomintang following the formation of the Nanjing faction in April 1927 against the existing faction in Wuhan. Members of the Chinese Communist Party, who had survived the April 12 massacre, met at Wuhan and reelected Chen Duxiu (Ch'en Tu-hsiu) as the Party's Secretary General. The split was partially motivated by the purge of the Communists within the party, which marked the end of the First United Front, and Chiang Kai-shek briefly stepped down as the commander of the National Revolutionary Army.In June 1927, Stalin sent a telegram to the Communists in Wuhan, calling for the mobilization of an army of workers and peasants. This alarmed Wang Jingwei, who decided to break with the Communists and come to terms with Chiang Kai-shek. The Wuhan coup was a political shift made on July 15, 1927, by Wang Jingwei towards Chiang Kai-shek, and his Shanghai-based rival in the Kuomintang. The Wuhan Nationalist Government was established in Wuhan on February 21, 1927, and ended by August 19, 1927. After the end of the Northern Expedition, Hankou was elevated to a centrally-controlled municipality.\n\nIn the 1931 China floods, one of the deadliest flood disasters in world history, Wuhan was a refuge for flood victims from outlying areas, who had been arriving since the late spring. But when the city itself was inundated in the early summer, and after a catastrophic dike failure just before 6:00 AM on July 27, an estimated 782,189 urban citizens and rural refugees were left homeless. The flood covered an area of 32 square miles and the city was flooded under many feet of water for close to three months. Large numbers gathered on flood islands throughout the city, with 30,000 sheltering on a railway embankment in central Hankou. With little food and a complete breakdown in sanitation, thousands soon began to succumb to diseases. Jin Shilong, Senior Engineer at the Hubei Flood Prevention Agency, described the flooding:There was no warning, only a sudden great wall of water. Most of Wuhan's buildings in those days were only one story high, and for many people there was no escape- they died by the tens of thousands. ... I was just coming off duty at the company's main office, a fairly new three-story building near the center of town ... When I heard the terrible noise and saw the wall of water coming, I raced to the top story of the building. ... I was in one of the tallest and strongest buildings left standing. At that time no one knew whether the water would subside or rise even higher.The high-water mark was reached on 19 August at Hankou, with the water level exceeding 16 m (53 ft) above normal. In 1936, when natural disaster struck Central China with widespread flooding affecting Hebei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Wuhan and Chongqing caused by the Yangtze and Huai Rivers bursting their banks, Ong Seok Kim, as Chairman of the Sitiawan Fundraising and Disaster Relief Committee, raised money and materials in support of the victims.\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War and following the fall of Nanking in December 1937, Wuhan had become the provisional capital of China's Kuomintang government, and became another focal point of pitched air battles beginning in early 1938 between modern monoplane bomber and fighter aircraft of the Imperial Japanese forces and the Chinese Air Force, which included support from the Soviet Volunteer Group in both planes and personnel, as U.S. support in war materials waned. As the battle raged on through 1938, Wuhan and the surrounding region had become the site of the Battle of Wuhan. After being taken by the Japanese in late 1938, Wuhan became a major Japanese logistics center for operations in southern China.\n\nIn early October 1938, Japanese troops moved east and north in the outskirts of Wuhan. As a result, numerous companies and enterprises and large numbers of people had to withdraw from Wuhan to the west of Hubei and Sichuan. The KMT navy undertook the responsibility of defending the Yangtze River on patrol and covering the withdrawal. On October 24, while overseeing the waters of the Yangtze River near the town of Jinkou (Jiangxia District in Wuhan) in Wuchang, the KMT gunboat Zhongshan came up against six Japanese aircraft. Though two were eventually shot down, the Zhongshan sank with 25 casualties. Raised from the bottom of the Yangtze River in 1997, and restored at a local shipyard, the Zhongshan has been moved to a purpose-built museum in Wuhan's suburban Jiangxia District, which opened on September 26, 2011.As a key center on the Yangtze, Wuhan was an important base for Japanese operations in China. On 18 December 1944, Wuhan was bombed by 77 American bombers that set off a firestorm that destroyed much of the city. For the next three days, Wuhan was bombed by the Americans, destroying all of the docks and warehouses of Wuhan, as well as the Japanese air bases in the city. The air raids killed thousands of Chinese civilians which American bombers did not know. \"According to casualty statistics compiled by Hankou city in 1946, more than 20,000 were killed or injured in the December bombings of 1944.\"Wuhan returned to Chinese control in September 1945. Administratively, Wuchang and Hanyang were initially combined into a new City of Wuchang, but in October 1946 were separated into the City of Wuchang (including Wuchang only) and the County of Hanyang. Hankou became a centrally controlled municipality in August 1947. Militarily, the Wuhan Forward Headquarters was established in Wuhan, headed by Bai Chongxi.\n\nDuring the later stages of the Chinese Civil War, Bai sought to broker peace, proposing that the Communist Party could rule northern China while the Nationalist government retained southern China. This was rejected, and on 15 May 1949 Bai and the Wuhan garrison retreated from the city. People's Liberation Army troops entered Wuhan on the afternoon of Monday, May 16, 1949.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n\nThe Changjiang Water Resources Commission was reestablished in February 1950 with its headquarters in Wuhan. From June to September 1954, the Yangtze River Floods were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to an unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. In 1969, a large stone monument was erected in the riverside park in Hankou honoring the heroic deeds in fighting the 1954 Yangtze River floods.\nBefore construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, Hunslet Engine Company built two extra heavy 0-8-0 locomotives for loading the train ferries for crossing the Yangtze River in Wuhan.\nThe project of building the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also known as the First Yangtze River Bridge, was regarded as one of the key projects during the first five-year plan. On October 25, 1955, construction began on the bridge proper. The same day in 1957, the whole project was completed and an opening-to-traffic ceremony was held on October 15. The First Yangtze River Bridge united the Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway with the Guangdong\u2013Hankou Railway into the Beijing\u2013Guangzhou Railway, making Wuhan a 'thoroughfare to nine provinces' (\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862) in name and in fact.\nAfter Chengdu Conference, Mao went to Chongqing and Wuhan in April to inspect the countryside and factories. In Wuhan, he called all the leaders of provinces and municipalities who had not attended Chengdu Conference to report their work. Tian Jiaying, the secretary of Mao, said that Wuhan Conference was a supplement to Chengdu Conference.In July 1967, civil strife struck the city in the Wuhan Incident (\"July 20th Incident\"), an armed conflict between two hostile groups who were fighting for control over the city at the height of the Cultural Revolution.In 1981, the Wuhan City Government commenced reconstruction of the Yellow Crane Tower at a new location, about 1 km (0.62 mi) from the original site, and it was completed in 1985. In 1957, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was built with one trestle of the bridge on the site of the tower, which had been last destroyed in 1884.During the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, students in Wuhan blocked the Yangtze River Railway bridge and another 4,000 gathered at the railway station. About one thousand students staged a railroad 'sit-in'. Rail traffic on the Beijing-Guangzhou and Wuhan-Dalian lines was interrupted. The students also urged employees of major state-owned enterprises to go on strike. The situation was so tense that residents reportedly began a bank run and resorted to panic-buying.\n\nIn the wake of the United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade on May 7, 1999, protests broke out throughout China, including in Wuhan.On June 22, 2000, a Wuhan Airlines flight from Enshi to Wuhan was forced to circle for 30 minutes due to thunderstorms. The aircraft eventually crashed on the banks of Han River in Hanyang District, all on-board perished (there were varying accounts of number of crews and passengers). In addition, the crash also killed 7 people on the ground.Chinese protesters organized boycotts of the French-owned retail chain Carrefour in major Chinese cities including Kunming, Hefei and Wuhan, accusing the French nation of pro-secessionist conspiracy and anti-Chinese racism. The BBC reported that hundreds of people demonstrated in Beijing, Wuhan, Hefei, Kunming and Qingdao. On May 19, 2011, Fang Binxing, the Principal of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (also known as \"Father of China's Great Fire Wall\") was hit on the chest by a shoe thrown at him by a Huazhong University of Science and Technology student who calls herself \"hanjunyi\" (\u5bd2\u541b\u4f9d, or \u5c0f\u6e56\u5317) while Fang was giving a lecture at Wuhan University.The city has been subject to devastating floods, which are now supposed to be controlled by the ambitious Three Gorges Dam, a project which was completed in 2008. The 2008 Chinese winter storms damaged water supply equipment in Wuhan: up to 100,000 people were out of running water when several water pipes burst, cutting the supply to local households. The 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat wave hit Wuhan on July 3.\nIn the 2010 China floods, the Han River at Wuhan experienced its worst flooding in twenty years, as officials continued sandbagging efforts along the Han and Yangtze Rivers in the city and checked reservoirs. In the 2011 China floods, Wuhan was flooded, with parts of the city losing power. In the 2016 China floods, Wuhan saw 570 mm (22 in) of rainfall during the first week of July, surpassing the record that fell on the city in 1991. A red alert for heavy rainfall was issued on 2 July, the same day that eight people died after a 15-meter (49 ft) section of a 2 m (6.6 ft) tall wall collapsed on top of them. The city's subway system, the Wuhan Metro was partially submerged as was the main railway station. At least 14 city residents were killed, one was missing, and more than 80,000 were relocated.In early July 2019, there were protests against plans for a new incinerator in Xinzhou District.The 2019 Military World Games were hosted in Wuhan in October.\nIn December 2019, an epidemic of a new coronavirus disease began in Wuhan. The disease, which became known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), spread and developed into the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Wuhan and other Hubei cities were placed under lockdown for nearly three months to contain the disease. On April 8, 2020, the Wuhan lockdown officially came to an end after no new domestic cases were reported in Hubei province.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Overview ===\n\nWuhan is in east-central Hubei, at latitude 29\u00b0 58'\u201331\u00b0 22' N and longitude 113\u00b0 41'\u2013115\u00b0 05' E. Wuhan sits at the confluence of the Han River flowing into the Yangtze River at the East of the Jianghan Plain along the Yangtze's middle reaches.\nThe metropolitan area comprises three parts\u2014Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang\u2014commonly called the \"Three Towns of Wuhan\" (hence the name \"Wuhan\", combining \"Wu\" from the first city and \"Han\" from the other two). The consolidation of these cities occurred in 1927 and Wuhan was thereby established. The three former cities face each other across the rivers and are linked by bridges, including one of the first modern bridges in China, known as the \"First Bridge\".\n\nWuchang lies South East of the Yangtze River that separates it from both Hankou and Hanyang.\nHankou sits North of the Yangtze River separating it from Wuchang. Hankou is North of the Han River separating it from Hanyang.\nHanyang lies West of the Yangtze separating it from Wuchang. Hanyang is south of the Han river separating it from Hankou.\nIt is simple in terrain \u2014 low and flat in the middle and hilly in the south, with the Yangtze and Han rivers winding through the city. The She River enters the Yangtze in Huangpi District. Wuhan occupies a land area of 8,494.41 square kilometers (3,279.71 sq mi), most of which is alluvial plain and decorated with hills and a great number of lakes and ponds. Water makes up one quarter of Wuhan's urban territory, which is the highest percentage among  major cities in China. Wuhan has nearly 200 lakes, including the East Lake of 33 km2, and Tangxun Lake, which are the largest lakes entirely within a city in China.Other well-known lakes include South Lake and Sand Lake. Liangzi Lake, the largest lake by surface area in Hubei province, is located in the southeast of Jiangxia District. At 709 m (2,326 ft) above sea level, the highest point in Wuhan is the main peak of Yunwu Mountain (\u4e91\u96fe\u5c71) in northwestern Huangpi District. There are also several mountains within the city limits of Wuhan including Mount Luojia (\u73de\u73c8\u5c71) in Wuchang District as well as Mount Hong (\u6d2a\u5c71) and Mount Yujia (\u55bb\u5bb6\u5c71/\u745c\u73c8\u5c71) in Hongshan District.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nWuhan's climate is humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) with abundant rainfall in summer and four distinctive seasons. Wuhan is known for its humid summers, when dewpoints can often reach 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) or more. Historically, along with Chongqing and Nanjing, Wuhan is referred to as one of the \"Three Furnacelike Cities\" along the Yangtze River for their hot summers. However, the climate data of recent years suggests that Wuhan is no longer among the top tier of \"The hottest cities in summer\" list, the New Four Furnacelike Cities are Chongqing, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, and Nanchang. Spring and autumn are generally mild, while winter is cool with quite low rainfall and occasional snow. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from 4.0 \u00b0C (39.2 \u00b0F) in January to 29.1 \u00b0C (84.4 \u00b0F) in July. Annual precipitation totals just under 1,320 mm (52 in), the majority of which falls from April to July; the annual mean temperature is 17.13 \u00b0C (62.8 \u00b0F), the frost-free period lasts 211 to 272 days. With monthly possible sunshine percentage ranging from 31 percent in March to 59 percent in August, the city proper receives 1,865 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extreme low and high temperatures recorded are \u221218.1 \u00b0C (\u22121 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1977 and 39.7 \u00b0C (103 \u00b0F) on 27 July 2017 (unofficial record of 41.3 \u00b0C (106 \u00b0F) in 1934).\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nWuhan is a sub-provincial city. Municipal government is regulated by the local Communist Party of China (CPC), led by the Wuhan CPC Secretary (Chinese: \u6b66\u6c49\u5e02\u59d4\u4e66\u8bb0), Wang Zhonglin (\u738b\u5fe0\u6797). The local CPC issues administrative orders, collects taxes, manages the economy, and directs a standing committee of the Municipal People's Congress in making policy decisions and overseeing the local government.\nGovernment officials include the mayor (\u5e02\u957f), Zhou Xianwang (\u5468\u5148\u65fa), and vice-mayors.

Since 2004 it has been a focal point of the Rise of Central China Plan, which aims to build less-developed inland economies into hubs of advanced manufacturing.\nSince 1890, the steel industry has been the backbone of Wuhan's industry. In 2010, automobile industry exceeded GDP for Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO) steel for the first time. There are 5 car manufacturers, including Dongfeng Honda, Citroen, Shanghai GM, DFM Passenger Vehicle and Dongfeng Renault. Dongfeng-Citroen Automobile Co., Ltd is headquartered in the city.As of 2016, Wuhan has attracted foreign investment from over 80 countries, with 5,973 foreign-invested enterprises established in the city with a total capital injection of $22.45 billion USD. Among these, about 50 French companies including Renault and PSA Group have operations in the city, representing over one third of French investment in China, and the highest level of French investment in any Chinese city.Wuhan is an important center for economy, trade, finance, transportation, information technology, and education in China. Its major industries include optic-electronic, automobile manufacturing, iron and steel manufacturing, new pharmaceutical sector, biology engineering, new materials industry and environmental protection.  Environmental sustainability is highlighted in Wuhan's list of emerging industries, which include energy efficiency technology and renewable energy.\n\n\n=== Industrial zones ===\nMajor industrial zones in Wuhan include in chronological order:\n\nWuhan Economic and Technological Development ZoneWuhan Economic and Technological Development Zone is a national level industrial zone incorporated in 1993.

It is located in Wuhan Economic and Technology Development Zone, planned to cover 2.7 square kilometers (1.0 square mile) of land. The first 0.7-square-kilometer (0.3-square-mile) area has already been created.\nWuhan Donghu New Technology Development ZoneWuhan Donghu New Technology Development Zone is a national level high-tech development zone. Optical-electronics, telecommunications, and equipment manufacturing are the core industries of Wuhan East Lake High-Tech Development Zone (ELHTZ) while software outsourcing and electronics are also encouraged. ELHTZ is China's largest production center for optoelectronic products with key players like Yangtze Optical Fiber and Cable, (the largest fiber-optical cable maker in China), and Fiberhome Telecommunications. Wuhan Donghu New Technology Development Zone also represents the development center for China's laser industry with key players such as HG Tech and Chutian Laser being based in the zone.\nWuhan Optical Valley (Guanggu) Software ParkWuhan Optical Valley (Guanggu) Software Park is located in Wuhan Donghu New Technology Development Zone. Wuhan Optics Valley Software Park is jointly developed by East Lake High-Tech Development Zone and Dalian Software Park Co., Ltd. The planned area is 0.67 square kilometers (0.26 square miles) with total floor area of 6,000,000 square meters (65,000,000 square feet). The zone is 8.5 km (5.28 mi) away from the 316 National Highway and is 46.7 km (29.02 mi) away from the Wuhan Tianhe Airport.\n\nWuhan BiolakeBiolake is an industrial base established in 2008 in the Optics Valley of China. Located in East Lake New Technology Development Zone of Wuhan, Biolake covers 15 km2 (5.8 sq mi), and has six parks including Bio-innovation Park, Bio-pharma Park, Bio-agriculture Park, Bio-manufacturing Park, Medical Device Park and Medical Health Park, to accommodate both research activities and living.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nWuhan is the most populous city in Central China and among the most populous in China.  In the Sixth Census of China in 2010, Wuhan's built-up area made of 8 out of 10 urban districts (all but Xinzhou and Hannan not yet conurbated) was home to 8,821,658 inhabitants. As of 2015, the city of Wuhan had an estimated population of 10,607,700 people.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 19 million.\nAs of November 2019, urban development status considering both spatial and socioeconomic processes has been examined using Night Time Lighting data and land cover data as proxies; it showed Wuhan's high concentration\nof socioeconomic activities compared to its urban spatial development.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nAccording to a survey published in 2017, 79.2% of the population of Wuhan are either irreligious or practice worship of gods and ancestors; among these 0.9% are Taoists. Among other religious doctrines, 14.7% of the population adheres to Buddhism, 2.9% to Protestantism, 0.3% to Catholicism and 1.6% to Islam, and 1.6% of the population adheres to unspecified other religions.\nReligious sites in Wuhan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nChina Railway Wuhan Group manages the Wuhan Railway Hub. Wuhan Railway Hub is considered one of the four key railway hubs of China. The city of Wuhan is served by three major railway stations: the Hankou Railway Station in Hankou, the Wuchang Railway Station in Wuchang, and the Wuhan Railway Station, located in a newly developed area east of the East Lake (Hongshan District). As the stations are many miles apart, it is important for passengers to be aware of the particular station(s) used by a particular train.\nThe (original) Hankou Station was the terminus for the Jinghan Railway from Beijing, while the Wuchang Station was the terminus for the Yuehan Railway to Guangzhou. Since the construction of the First Yangtze Bridge and the linking of the two lines into the Jingguang Railway, both Hankou and Wuchang stations have been served by trains going to all directions, which contrasts with the situation in such cities as New York or Moscow, where different stations serve different directions.\nWith the opening of the Hefei-Wuhan high-speed railway on April 1, 2009, Wuhan became served by high-speed trains with Hefei, Nanjing, and Shanghai; several trains a day now connect the city with Shanghai, getting there in under 6 hours. As of early 2010, most of these express trains leave from the Hankou Railway Station.\n\nIn 2006, construction began on the new Wuhan Railway Station with 11 platforms, located on the northeastern outskirts of the city. In December 2009, the station was opened, as China unveiled its second high-speed train with scheduled runs from Guangzhou to Wuhan. Billed as the fastest train in the world, it can reach a speed of 394 km/h (244.82 mph). The travel time between the two cities has been reduced from ten and a half hours to just three. The rail service has been extended north to Beijing.As of 2011, the new Wuhan Railway Station is primarily used by the Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed trains, while most regular trains to other destinations continue to use the Hankou and Wuchang stations.\n\nConstruction work is carried out on several lines of the new Wuhan Metropolitan Area Intercity Railway, which will eventually connect Wuhan's three main rail terminals with several stations throughout the city's outer areas and farther suburbs, as well as with the nearby cities of Xianning, Huangshi, Huanggang, and Xiaogan. The first line of the system, the one to Xianning, opened for passenger operations at the end of 2013. The line to Xiaogen opened on 1 December 2016 and it was extended with the opening of the Wuhan\u2013Shiyan high-speed railway to Shiyan on 29 November 2019.The main freight railway station and classification yard of the Wuhan metropolitan area is the extensive Wuhan North railway station, with 112 tracks and over 650 switches. It is located in Hengdian Subdistrict of Huangpi District, located 20 km (12 mi) north of the Wuhan Station and 23 km (14 mi) from Hankou Station.\n\n\n=== Wuhan Metro ===\n\nWuhan Metro is a rapid transit system serving the city of Wuhan. Owned and operated by Wuhan Metro Group Co., Ltd., the network now includes 9 lines, 228 stations, and 339 km (211 mi) of route length. Line 1, the first line in the system, opened on 28 July 2004, which made Wuhan became the seventh city in mainland China with rapid transit system, after Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Changchun, and Dalian. Line 2 opened on 28 December 2012 and is the first underground metro line crossing the Yangtze River. With 1.22 billion annual passengers in 2019, Wuhan Metro is the sixth-busiest rapid transit system in mainland China. There are a number of lines or sections under construction. The government of Wuhan City promised the citizens that at least two lines or sections open every year. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire network was out of service from 23 January to 27 March 2020.\n\n\n=== Trams ===\n\nTrams were brought to the streets of Wuhan on July 28, 2017 with the first line (Auto-city T1 Line) opened that day. The trams under construction or planning in Wuhan are:\n\nAuto-city trams, with Lines T1, T2, T6, and T8 in the Wuhan Economic Development Area, in the far western reaches on Hanyang. T1 Line is operational as of 2017.\nOptics Valley trams, two lines  (T1 and T2) south and east of Guanggu Circle (Guanggu Guangchang) in southeastern Wuchang. The system opened on January 18, 2018.\nThe Old Hankou Streetcar, a loop line around Hankou city.\n\n\n=== Maritime transport ===\nWuhan is a major hub for maritime transport in central China. The Port of Wuhan provide services for the local population and shipping services.\n\n\n=== Ferry ===\nAs a city located at bank of Yangtze River, Wuhan has long history of ferry services. Modern ferry services were established in 1900 by steam boat. In 1937, a train ferry was established to transport train cars from Hankou to Wuchang. There are numbered stops around Wuhan where people can get on and off the ferry and there is a tourist ferry in the night.\nCurrently, ferry services are provided by the Wuhan Ferry Company. In 2010, the company bought 10 new ships to replace the ones that had been in service for 29 years.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nOpened in April 1995 to substitute for the old Hankou Wangjiadun Airport and Nanhu Airport as the major airport of Wuhan, Wuhan Tianhe International Airport is one of the busiest airports in central China. It is located in Wuhan's suburban Huangpi District 26 kilometers (16 mi) north of Wuhan city proper. The extension of Line 2 of Wuhan Metro to Tianhe Airport opened on 28 December 2016. It has also been selected as China's fourth international hub airport after Beijing Capital International Airport, Shanghai-Pudong and Guangzhou Baiyun. A second terminal was completed in March 2008, having been started in February 2005 with an investment of CNY 3.372 billion. International flights to neighboring Asian countries have also been enhanced, including direct flights to Tokyo and Nagoya, Japan. Terminal 3 has been available for service since early 2017.\nHannan Municipal Airport is an municipal airport that serves Hannan District. It is the biggest airport in China that only handles general aviation, and the biggest municipal airport in Hubei Province. Caidian Municipal Airport is an under-construction airport which will serve Caidian District. The airport began construction on 1 December 2017.\n\n\n=== Highways and expressways ===\nNumerous major highways and expressways pass through Wuhan, including:\n\nChina National Highway 107\nChina National Highway 316\nChina National Highway 318\nG42 Shanghai\u2013Chengdu Expressway\nG0422 Wuhan\u2013Shenzhen Expressway\n\n\n=== Bicycle-sharing system ===\nAs of May 2011, the Wuhan and Hangzhou Public Bicycle bike-share systems in China were the largest in the world, with around 90,000 and 60,000 bicycles respectively. In 2012 the Wuhan and Hangzhou Public Bicycle programs in China are the largest in the world, with around 90,000 and 60,000 bicycles respectively. China has seen a rise in private \"dockless\" bike shares with fleets that dwarf systems in size outside China. Initially, a number of traditional (third generation) docked public bike systems operated by local municipal governments opened across China, with the largest ones being in Wuhan and Hangzhou.  The first was introduced in Beijing in 2007.  However, third generation bike sharing is not considered successful for the majority cities in China.  Bike sharing in Beijing virtually stopped and it also has encountered difficulties in Shanghai and Wuhan.\n\n\n== Destinations ==\n\nThe Yellow Crane Tower (Huanghelou) is presumed to have been first built in approximately 220 AD. The tower has been destroyed and reconstructed numerous times, and was burned last according to some sources in 1884. The tower underwent complete reconstruction in 1981. The reconstruction utilized modern materials and added an elevator while maintaining the traditional design in the tower's outward appearance.\nWuchang has the largest and second largest lakes within a city in China, the East Lake and Tangxun Lake, as well as the South Lake. East Lake in Wuhan is six times the size of the West Lake in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province. The total area is more than 80 km2 (31 sq mi) of which the lake is covering an area of 33 km2 (13 sq mi). In the springtime, the shores of East Lake become a garden of flowers with the Mei blossoms as the king and the Cherry Blossom as the queen among the species at East Lake Cherry Blossom Park. Another famous flower is the lotus. The lake has a long history and especially the Chu Kingdom is well represented around East Lake. Moreover, in the Moshan Botanic Garden there are many types of plum blossoms, as well as lotus flowers.\nThe Hubei Provincial Museum: With over 200,000 valued artifacts, this is one of the leading museums in China.

Since the 1950s it has received international students from more than 109 countries.\n\n\n=== Scientific research ===\n\nWuhan contains three national development zones and four scientific and technological development parks, as well as numerous enterprise incubators, over 350 research institutes, 1470 high-tech enterprises, and over 400,000 experts and technicians.\nFounded in 1958, the Wuhan Branch of Chinese Academy of Sciences is one of the twelve national branches of CAS. It is composed of 9 independent organizations, including the headquarters at Xiaohongshan, Wuchang. It has had a staff of 3,900, among which 8 are CAS fellows, and one is a Chinese Academy of Engineering fellow. As of 2013, the achievements gained by WHB had won 23 National Awards and 778 Provincial Awards. Wuhan Research Institute of Post and Telecommunications (now known as FiberHome Technologies Group) is the national center for optical communication research in China, and is where the first optical fiber in the country was produced.Wuhan University of Technology is another major national university in the area. Founded in the year 2000, it was merged from three major universities, Wuhan University of Technology (established in 1948), Wuhan Transportation University (established in 1946) and Wuhan Automotive Polytechnic University (established in 1958). Wuhan University of Technology is one of the leading Chinese universities accredited by the Ministry of Education and one of the universities constructed with priority by \"State Project 211\" for Chinese higher education institutions. The University has three main campuses located in the Wuchang District.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe headquarters of Hubei Television is located in Wuchang District. Tortoise Mountain TV Tower is China's first self-developed TV tower, opened in 1986. The modern newspapers in Wuhan can be dated back to 1866, when Hankow Times, a newspaper in English, was founded. Before 1949, more than 50 newspapers and magazines were published by foreigners in Wuhan. Chao-wen Hsin-pao, founded by Ai Xiaomei in 1873, was the first Chinese newspaper to appear in Hankou (one of the cities that was merged into Wuhan). During the Northern Expedition era (1926\u20131928), journalism in Wuhan came to a climax; more than 120 newspapers and periodicals, including national newspapers such as Central Daily News and Republican Daily News, were founded or published during this time. Chutian Metropolis Daily and Wuhan Evening News are two major local commercial tabloid newspapers. Both of them have entered the list of 100 most widely circulated newspapers of the world.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe plum blossom is the city's emblem, chosen partly because of the long history of local plum cultivation and use, and partly to recognize the plum's current economic significance in terms of cultivation and research. Local wild plums were used medicinally during the Qin and Han dynasties. Cultivation of the fruit began during the Song dynasty. Some traditional new year customs revolve around the planting of plums.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nWuhan natives speak a variety of Southwestern Mandarin Chinese referred to as Wuhan dialect that differs slightly between the districts of Wuhan, including Wuchang dialect in Wuchang District, Hankou dialect in the Hankou districts, Hanyang dialect in Hanyang District, and Qingshan dialect in Qingshan District.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nHubei cuisine is one of China's ten major styles of cooking. With a history of more than 2,000 years, Hubei cuisine, originating in ancient Chu cuisine, has developed a number of distinctive dishes, such as steamed blunt-snout bream in clear soup, preserved ham with flowering Chinese cabbage, and others. On the third day of the third month of the lunar calendar, many in Wuhan eat d\u00ecc\u00e0i zh\u01d4 j\u012bd\u00e0n (\u5730\u83dc\u716e\u9e21\u86cb), an egg dish which is supposed to prevent illness in the coming year.\"No need to be particular about the recipes; all foods have their own uses. Rice wine and tangyuan are excellent midnight snacks, while fat bream and flowering Chinese cabbages are great delicacies.\" This attitude expressed in Hankou Zhuzhici reflects indirectly the eating habits and a wide variety of distinctive snacks with a long history in Wuhan, such as Qingshuizong (a pyramid-shaped dumpling made of glutinous rice wrapped in bamboo or reed leaves) in the Period of the Warring States, Chunbinbian in Northern and Southern dynasties, mung bean jelly in the Sui dynasty, youguo (a deep-fried twisted dough stick) in the Song and Yuan dynasties, rice wine and mianwo in the Ming and Qing dynasties, as well as three-delicacy stuffed skin of bean milk, tangbao (steamed dumpling filled with minced meat and gravy) and hot braised noodles (reganmian) in modern times.\nGuozao (\u904e\u65e9) is a popular way to say 'having breakfast' in Wuhan, and a part of the city's culture. As a hub for land transport in China, Wuhan has gathered and mixed together various habits and customs from neighboring cities and provinces in all directions, which gives rise to a concentration of diverse cuisines from different places. The most famous place to guozao (have breakfast) is Hubu Street (\u6236\u90e8\u5df7), a 150-meter-long street in the neighborhood of Simenkou (\u53f8\u95e8\u53e3). Along its short length one can find nearly all the traditional foods of Wuhan, such as:\n\nHot and dry noodles, re-gan mian (\u70ed\u5e72\u9762), consists of long freshly boiled noodles mixed with sesame paste. It is considered to be the most typical local food for breakfast.\nDuck's neck or Ya Bozi (\u9e2d\u8116\u5b50) is a local version of this popular Chinese dish, made of duck necks and spices.\nBean skin or doupi (\u8c46\u76ae) is a local dish with a filling of egg, rice, beef, mushrooms and beans cooked between two large round soybean skins and cut into pieces, structurally like a stuffed pizza without enclosing edges.\nSoup dumpling or xiaolongtangbao (\u5c0f\u7b3c\u6c64\u5305) is a kind of dumpling with thin skin made of flour, steamed with very juicy meat inside, hence the name: tang (soup) bao (bun) \u2013 every time one takes a bite from it the \"soup\" inside is liable to spill out.\nA salty doughnut or mianwo (\u9eaa\u7aa9) is a kind of savory donut with a salty taste. It is much thinner than a common donut and is a typical Wuhan local food.\n\n\n=== Opera ===\nHan opera, which is the local opera of Wuhan area, was one of China's oldest and most popular operas. During the late Qing dynasty, Han opera, blended with Hui opera, gave birth to Peking opera, the most popular opera in modern China. Thus Han opera has been called the \"mother of Peking opera.\"\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nWuhan has a professional football team, Wuhan Zall F.C., that plays in the Chinese Super League. Xinhua Road Sport Center, the team's home stadium, with a capacity of 32,137, is located in the heart of the city next to Zhongshan Park. For the 2013 season, Wuhan Zall was promoted to the top-tier league of Chinese football, Chinese Super League, and relocated its home to Wuhan Sports Center Stadium, a modern stadium with 54,357 seats located in the suburbs of the city. However, the team did not play well in the ensuing season and was demoted back to China League One as the 2013 season ended. For financial and transportation reasons, the team moved back to Xinhua Road Sport Center in 2014.\nThe Wuhan Gators are a professional arena football team based in Wuhan. They are members of the China Arena Football League (CAFL).The 13,000-seat Wuhan Gymnasium held the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship and was one of the venues for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup. The 7th Military World Games were hosted in Wuhan from Oct. 18 to 27, 2019.The city has been the venue for the women's tennis tournament, the Wuhan Open, one of the WTA's Premier 5 tournaments, since 2014.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Bridges ===\n\nWuhan has eleven bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze River. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also called the First Bridge, was built over the Yangtze in 1957, carrying a railroad directly across the river between hills known as Snake Hill and Turtle Hill. Before this bridge was built it could take up to an entire day to barge railcars across. Including its approaches, it is 5,511 feet (1,680 m) long, and it accommodates both a double-track railway on a lower deck and a four-lane roadway above. It was built with the assistance of advisers from the Soviet Union.\nThe Second Bridge, a cable-stayed bridge built of prestressed concrete, has a central span of 400 meters (1,300 feet); it is 4,678 meters (15,348 feet) in length (including 1,877 meters (6,158 feet) of the main bridge) and 26.5 to 33.5 meters (86.9 to 109.9 feet) in width. Its main bridgeheads are 90 meters (300 feet) high each, pulling 392 thick slanting cables together in the shape of double fans so that the central span of the bridge is well poised on the piers and the bridge's stability and vibration resistance are ensured. With six lanes on the deck, the bridge is designed to handle the daily passage of 50,000 motor vehicles. The bridge was completed in 1995.\n\nThe Third Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also called Baishazhou Bridge, was completed in September 2000. Located 8.6 kilometers (5.3 miles) southwest of the First Bridge, construction of Baishazhou Bridge started in 1997. With an investment of over 1.4 billion yuan (about US$170,000,000), the bridge, which is 3,586 meters (11,765 feet) long and 26.5 meters (86.9 feet) wide, has six lanes and has a capacity of 50,000 vehicles a day. The bridge is expected to serve as a major passage for the future Wuhan Ring Road, greatly easing the city's traffic and aiding local economic development.\nThe Yangluo Bridge carries Wuhan's Ring Road across the Yangtze in the city's eastern suburbs (connecting the Hongshan District with the Xinzhou District). It was opened on December 26, 2007.\nThe Wuhan Tianxingzhou Yangtze River Bridge crosses the Yangtze in the northeastern part of the city, downstream of the Second bridge. It is named after Tianxing Island (Tianxingzhou), above which it crosses the river. Built at a cost of 11 billion yuan, the 4,657-meter cable suspension bridge was opened on December 26, 2009, in time for the opening of the Wuhan Railway Station. It is a combined road and rail bridge, and carries the Wuhan\u2013Guangzhou High-Speed Railway across the river.\n\n\n=== Skyscrapers ===\n\nThe Yellow Crane Tower, historically one of the tallest buildings in Wuhan, is considered one of the Four Great Towers of China and was destroyed twelve times, both by warfare and by fire. The tower is classified as an AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration. At 438 meters (1,437 ft) in height, the Wuhan Center skyscraper, the tallest structure in Wuhan and in Central China, is the eighth tallest structure in China. The Minsheng Bank Building, the second tallest structure in Wuhan, was the tallest building in Wuhan when it was completed in 2007. It retained the title until Wuhan Center surpassed it in 2014. Wuhan World Trade Tower is a 273-meter (896 foot) tall skyscraper located in Wuhan. It became the tallest building in Wuhan after its completion in 1998. However, it was surpassed by the Minsheng Bank Building in 2007.\nThe Wuhan Greenland Center is a planned 636-meter (2,087 ft), 126-floor mixed-use skyscraper currently under construction and scheduled for completion in 2019. If completed as planned, it will be among the world's tallest structures, and one of the world's tallest buildings by occupiable floor height. The Phoenix Towers are proposed supertall skyscrapers planned for construction in Wuhan. At 1 kilometer (3,300 ft) high, the towers would also be among the tallest structures in the world when completed.\n\n\n== Notable Wuhanese ==\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nLi Yuanhong \u2013 former President of the Republic of China (1916\u201317, 1922\u201323).\nWu Yi \u2013 former Vice-Premier and Minister of Health of the People's Republic of China\n\n\n=== Business ===\nWei Brian - Chinese entrepreneur\n\n\n=== Science ===\nChang-Lin Tien \u2013 seventh Chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley (1990\u20131997) and a major founder of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering (NAE).

        "wiki": "Jiujiang (Chinese: \u4e5d\u6c5f), formerly transliterated Kiukiang or Kew Keang, is a prefecture-level city located on the southern shores of the Yangtze River in northwest Jiangxi Province, People's Republic of China.  It is the second-largest prefecture-level city in Jiangxi province after the provincial capital Nanchang.  Jiujiang literally means \"nine rivers\".\nIts population was 4,728,778 inhabitants at the 2010 census whom 704,986 in the built up area made of 2 urban districts (Xunyang and Lianxi).  In 2007, the city is named China's top ten livable cities by Chinese Cities Brand Value Report, which was released at 2007 Beijing Summit of China Cities Forum.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nDistricts:Xunyang District (\u6d54\u9633\u533a)\nLianxi District (\u6fc2\u6eaa\u533a)\nChaisang District (\u67f4\u6851\u533a)Counties:Wuning County (\u6b66\u5b81\u53bf)\nXiushui County (\u4fee\u6c34\u53bf)\nYongxiu County (\u6c38\u4fee\u53bf)\nDe'an County (\u5fb7\u5b89\u53bf)\nDuchang County (\u90fd\u660c\u53bf)\nHukou County (\u6e56\u53e3\u53bf)\nPengze County (\u5f6d\u6cfd\u53bf)County-level city:Ruichang (\u745e\u660c\u5e02)\nGongqingcheng (\u5171\u9752\u57ce\u5e02).

During the Xia through the Shang Dynasties the capitals of several states were located in area of Jiujiang. In the Spring & Autumn Period (770-476 BCE) Jiujiang bordered between the states of Wu (downstream, to the east) and Chu (upstream, to the west). Tao Yuanming (365-429 CE) a famous Chinese philosopher lived at the base of Lushan. He was once appointed magistrate of nearby Pengze County and after 83 days resigned due to the politics involved in administering justice. He retired back to his village to pen an essay called \"Peach Blossom Spring\". In 757, Li Bai (701-762 CE) was implicated in An-Shi disturbances and imprisoned at Jiujiang. Bai Juyi (772-846 CE) wrote a poem called \"Lute Song\", which is about his sadness and isolation of forced exile as a middle rank official to reside in such a small town. In the 13th century Zhu Xi was a Confucian philosopher who practiced at the White Deer Grotto Academy, on Lushan's eastern flanks.\nJiujiang has also been known as Jiangzhou and Xunyang in former times. During the Jin Dynasty (265-420) it was known as Sin Yang, the Liang dynasty (502-557) it was called Jiangzhou. The Sui Dynasty saw its name as Jiujiang and the Song Dynasty (960-1127) called it Ting Jiang. The Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644), gave it Jiujiang which has retained its name to this day. It was a Taiping rebellion stronghold for five years (1850\u201364) after they devastated the town to only leave one street with buildings intact. The city served as the capital of Taiping's Jiangxi province during this time.\n\nA member of Lord Elgin's committee arriving in 1858 to survey Chinese ports for treaty status noted: \"We found it to the last degree deplorable.\" A single dilapidated street, composed only of a few mean shops, was all that existed of this once thriving populous city. The remainder of the vast area composed within its massive walls 9-10 kilometers in circumference, contained nothing but ruins, weeds and kitchen gardens.  After becoming an open treaty port in 1862, it was exporting Jiangxi's vast rice crop. In 1904, more than 160,000 kilos of opium were moved through its customs house.\nThe New York Methodist Mission Society's Superintendent, Virgil C. Hart, arrived in Kiukiang in 1866 and bought a piece of property just east of the city wall. This is where the city's first Methodist Church and western hospital was built, with the hospital renamed the #1 Hospital, and the oldest/continuous operating hospital in Jiangxi Province. In 1896 Drs. Mary Stone (Shi Meiyu) and Ida Kahn (Kahn Cheng) arrived back in Jiujiang, being China's first two native female western-educated doctors; having graduated from the University of Michigan Medical School. They were provided with funds collected by Dr. I. N. Danforth (from Chicago residents), to build the Elizabeth Skelton Danforth Hospital and administered entirely by the native Chinese. This was later renamed Jiujiang Women's and Children's Hospital, and the nursing education by Drs. Stone and Kahn would later be the impetus for the founding of Jiujiang University and Jiujiang Medical School.It became one of the three centers of the tea trade in China along with Hankou and Fuzhou.  The Russians had two brick tea producing factories, but ceased operations after 1917. On October 16, 1927 there was an explosion of ammunition on the Chinese troopship Kuang Yuang near Jiujiang. The British surrendered their concession in 1927 after being robbed and its Chinese workers mutineered their posts to the marauding crowds. An economic recession had set in over the decades as Indian and Chelonian tea made for greater competition. A military advance was being staged upriver in Wuhan by the Kuomintang in 1927 and all the remaining expatriate community fled on British and American warships towards safer waters of Shanghai, to never return.Jiujiang languished as a port and much of its export trade was siphoned off with the connecting of Nanchang to coastal rail lines built in 1936\u201337. Until 1949 Jiujiang had very little industry except for local handicrafts. Manufacturing is Jiujiang's backbone today with auto, machinery, petrochemical, shipbuilding and textiles as its cornerstones. After the completion of the Yangtze River Bridge in 1992 and the Beijing to Kowloon (Hong Kong) and Wuhan to Shanghai rail systems laid, a convenient ground corridor was provided and a regional airport now serves most of China's capital cities.\nThe city suffered only slight damage in the 2005 Ruichang earthquake, but there were several deaths reported in outlying areas.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nThe city administers a total population of approximately 4,728,778 at the 2010 census of whom approximately 704,986 are urban living in the built-up area.  The population density is 249 per km\u00b2. Han Chinese make up 99.8% of the population, but registered residents include representatives of 25 minority nationalities, including six with a local population of more than 100: Hui, Miao, Zhuang, Tujia, and She.\nUnlike the Gan dialects typical of Jiangxi, the local speech of Jiujiang is a variety of Lower Yangtze Mandarin.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\n\n== Industry ==\nPrimary industries include\n\nPetrochemical refinement\nAgricultural chemical production\nImport/export (through river port)\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nG56 Hangzhou\u2013Ruili Expressway\nG70 Fuzhou\u2013Yinchuan Expressway\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nJiujiang is served by the Beijing-Kowloon, Tongling\u2013Jiujiang, Hefei\u2013Jiujiang, Wuhan\u2013Jiujiang and Nanchang\u2013Jiujiang Intercity Railway, via Jiujiang Railway Station.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nJiujiang Lushan Airport (JIU)\n\n\n=== Yangtze River ===\nThe Yangtze River is used heavily for shipping. There is currently one bridge, the Jiujiang Bridge, that carries road and rail over the river. A second bridge, the Jiujiang Fuyin Expressway Bridge, is under construction that will carry traffic on the G70 Fuzhou\u2013Yinchuan Expressway.\n\n\n== Colleges and universities ==\n\nJiujiang University: Located farther out from the city center, it is most easily reached by the 101 bus from the center.\nJiujiang Financial and Economic College: A small picturesque college located right by the lake and next to Walmart, this college is well situated within the city.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2014 Sister cities ===\nJiujiang is twinned with:\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nMount Lu, located in the south of the urban center, is listed as a world heritage site.\nStone Bell Hill: Just downriver from Jiujiang is Hukou where the Yangtze River and waters of Boyang Lake converge with an abrupt color change. People have been coming here for centuries to listen to the stone-bell sound resonating from the cliffs overlooking this spot. A few theories are provided why this rare geographical phenomenon happens. Li Daoyuan from the Northern Wei period (386-534) theorizes that it is because the hill has a bell-shaped appearance and hollow inside, thus providing the sound when struck. Or it may be because of the water lapping within the limestone nooks and fissures around its base, as famous litterateur from the same time Su Shui discovered. Su Dongpo also did three trips around its perimeter, before settling on this last explanation for its unique sound also. Many Chinese literati's have left more than twenty calligraphy masterpieces carved upon its rocks, with some dating back to the Tang dynasty (618-907 CE).\nXunyang Tower (simplified Chinese: \u6d54\u9633\u697c; traditional Chinese: \u6f6f\u967d\u6a13) is an ancient Chinese tower in Xunyang District,Jiujiang, Jiangxi Province, on the shore of Xunyang River.It is one of the Ten Great Towers of Jiangnan.\n\nNanshan Park (\u5357\u5c71\u516c\u56ed): Completed in early 2013, this park, home to a new pagoda, is covered in flora and lights up the Jiujiang sky at night.\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (Chinese)\n\u4e5d\u6c5f\u4fe1\u606f\u6e2f Jiujiang China Telecom Portal\nJiujiang Traffic Police Information Portal\n\n\n== References ==",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Wuhan Tianhe International Airport (IATA: WUH, ICAO: ZHHH) serves Wuhan, the capital of the Hubei province, People's Republic of China. It was opened on 15 April 1995, replacing the old Hankou Wangjiadun Airport and Nanhu Airport as the major airport of Wuhan. The airport is located in Wuhan's suburban Huangpi District, around 26 km (16 mi) to the north of Wuhan city center. \nIt is the busiest airport in central China as it is geographically located in the centre of China's airline route network. The airport served 20,772,000 passengers in 2016, making it the 14th busiest airport by passenger traffic in China. The airport is a focus city for Air China, China Eastern Airlines, and China Southern Airlines. The airport has flights to international destinations such as New York City, San Francisco, London, Tokyo, Rome, Istanbul, Dubai, Paris, Sydney, Bali, Bangkok, Moscow, Osaka, Seoul, and Singapore. The name Tianhe (\u5929\u6cb3) can be literally translated as \"Sky River\"; Tianhe is also one of the names for the Milky Way in ancient Chinese.Since 2019, passengers from 53 countries such as the EU countries, Japan, South Korea, Russia, the U.S., when transiting to a third country, can enter China from this airport without a Chinese visa for up to 144 hours.Since January 23, 2020, the airport has been closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is part of the 2020 Hubei lockdowns, a response to the pandemic. The airport reopened on April 8, 2020 following a large-scale disinfection.\n\n\n== History ==\nTo replace the old Wangjiadun Airport, the Chinese government permitted plans to build a commercial airport in Tianhe Town, Huangpi District, Wuhan on 1 July 1985. The first term construction started in December 1989 and finished in April 1994. It initially operated domestic flights but later in 2000, the CAA re-designated it as an international airport.\nThe airport has expanded twice \u2013 first for terminal 2 and second for terminal 3, new control tower and the second runway.\nWuhan opened up to intercontinental flights when Air France began service from Paris on 11 April 2012, and two years later opened up to the United States non-stop when China Southern Airlines announced, in September 2014, a daily non-stop flight to San Francisco, originating from Guangzhou, operating with a Boeing 787 to begin December 16, 2014.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\n\n=== Runways ===\nTianhe International Airport has two runways.\n\n\n==== Runway West (04L 22R) ====\nLength: 3,400 m (11,200 ft), width: 45 m (148 ft)\n\n\n==== Runway East (04R 22L main runway) ====\nLength: 3,600 m (11,800 ft), width: 60 m (200 ft)\n\n\n==== ILS ====\nTianhe Airport equipped with ILS II in south side (main landing side), ILS I in north side. The East runway is equipped with blind landing systems.\n\n\n=== Terminals ===\n\n\n==== Terminal 1 (demolished) ====\nTerminal 1 was opened in 1995 when all flight services were transferred from Nanhu Airport to Tianhe International Airport. It was located at where the west concourse of Terminal 3 stands nowadays. It had been the only terminal of the airport until Terminal 2 was completed in 2008.\nFrom 2008 onwards, all domestic flights were operated at T2 while international flights were still operated at T1. T1 was closed in 2010 after serving international flights for two years. A new international terminal was built in 2010, and has undergone subsequent expansions after seeing major increase of international travelers. The terminal was demolished during the construction of Terminal 3.\n\n\n==== Terminal 2 (closed) ====\nTerminal 2 was the main terminal for Tianhe Airport during 2008\u20132017, which handled only domestic airlines. It has a floor area of 121,200 square meters and a designed capacity to handle 13 million passengers and 320,000 tons of cargo a year. The project was completed in April 15, 2008, at a total cost of 3.37 billion yuan (421.5 million US dollars). By 2010, Wuhan served at least 5 international and 100 domestic routes. The airport's cargo-handling capacity is to reach 144,000 tons.\nTerminal 2 was closed when Terminal 3 were officially opened in mid 2017 for the upgrade construction.\n\n\n==== International Terminal (closed) ====\n\nThe International Terminal was opened in December 2010 and all international flights and flights to Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan operated at the International Terminal from 2010 to 2017. After the old Terminal 1 was closed in 2010, the International Terminal was sometimes mistakenly called \"T1\" by passengers.\nThe single-floor terminal is located at the southwest of Terminal 2. It has a floor area of 5310 square meters, shared by both departure and arrival facilities. To handle wide-body jet within limited ramp, there is no air-bridge for this terminal.Due to its compact size and the growing number of international flights, there were complaints that Terminal 1 was \"too crowded\". In 2013, the average departure traffic was 880 per hour during the peak season, which was far greater than its designed maximum capacity of 550.The International Terminal was closed in mid 2017 and it will be turned to a chartered and VIP terminal in the future.\n\n\n==== Terminal 3 ====\n\nStarting from August 31, 2017, all flights from the original International Terminal (international, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) and T2 (domestic) have been moved to Terminal 3, which has a passenger capacity of 35 million. Following the opening of the new Terminal 3, International Terminal (IT) and Terminal 2 (T2) were closed temporarily for renovation. IT is scheduled to operate as the VIP terminal. T2 will undergo renovation and reopen when passengers in T3 exceed the design limit.The T3 has a new departure lounge, restaurants and duty-free shops.\nThe construction of Terminal 3 started in June 2013 and it was opened on August 31, 2017. A new runway, new control tower, and a transportation hub connecting the airport to the city with an intercity railway and a metro line have been built and opened along with the new terminal.\n\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\n\n\n=== Passenger ===\n\n\n=== Cargo ===\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nTwo tolled expressways, the S18 Wuhan Airport Expressway and the S19 Wuhan Airport 2nd Expressway, connect the airport to downtown Hankou.\n\n\n=== Public Transit ===\nThere is a limited bus service between Wuhan Tianhe Airport and several bus stops in the urban area of Wuhan.The Wuhan\u2013Xiaogan Intercity Railway, one of the lines of the Wuhan Metropolitan Area intercity railway, serves Wuhan Tianhe Airport. This railway opened in December 2016.The extension of Line 2 of Wuhan Metro to Tianhe Airport opened on 28 December 2016.\n\n\n== Future development ==\nPresently, Tianhe is the only civic airport in the Wuhan metropolitan area. However, the city authorities are considering repurposing the military Shanpo Airfield (\u5c71\u5761\u673a\u573a; 30\u00b005\u203217\u2033N 114\u00b018\u203252\u2033E), located in the city's far southern suburbs (Shanpo Township, Jiangxia District), as a commercial cargo airport. If the plans are implemented, Shanpo will become Wuhan's second airport.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWuhan Tianhe International Airport Official website (in Chinese)\nAirport information for ZHHH at World Aero Data.

          "Not really a hot spot and difficult to find. The temple is crammed between buildings and there is not much to see for tourists. The architecture is strange, it is built after 1900 and looks like one of these churches. Inside there are the same Buddha figures as in all other",

          "I have mixed feelings about this place. The architecture is very interesting, but they're building this new temple right next to it and not bothering to try and make it fit in with the slightly older architecture of the previous building. It's going to be pretty ugly, at least",
          "Well, if you will come there by taxi, or with crowded tourist bus, you will not feel the place. We suggest you to take a metro and get off on the nearest station, which is Tou Dao street, and have a quick 10 minutes walk through the district. After that, when you will discover",
          "This is a neat temple. The only problem is that the local people spit on everything. It's difficult to enjoy when you hear the sound of someone hocking a loogie every few minutes!",
          "Although this temple is very similar to many others, it is nice and quiet. Very interesting architecture and sculptures.",
          "Visiting this temple was a serendipitous experience for my wife and I when visiting Hankou. The temple is a mix of styles: Burmese domes, Hindu gods, Buddhist statues as well as Gothic and Roman styles. I understand that the temple was built in the 1880\u2019s during the early part"

It is located in Wuhan, the capital of Central China's Hubei Province. It is a Chinese Ministry of Education Double First Class Discipline University, with Double First Class status in certain disciplines.It is regarded as one of the top geosciences university in China and exerts considerable influence on the Chinese mining and oil industry. Its notable alumni include Wen Jiabao, the Premier of China's State Council between 2003 and 2013, who attended the China University of Geosciences when it was known as the Beijing Institute of Geology (BIG).

        "wiki": "Wuhan (simplified Chinese: \u6b66\u6c49; traditional Chinese: \u6b66\u6f22, [\u00f9.x\u00e2n] (listen)) is the capital city of Hubei Province in the People's Republic of China. It is the largest city in Hubei and the most populous city in Central China, with a population of over 11 million, the ninth most populous Chinese city and one of the nine National Central Cities of China.The name \"Wuhan\" came from the city's historical origin from the conglomeration of Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang, which are collectively known as the \"Three Towns of Wuhan\" (\u6b66\u6c49\u4e09\u9547).  It lies in the eastern Jianghan Plain, at the confluence of the Yangtze river and its largest tributary, the Han River and is known as \"Nine Provinces' Thoroughfare\" (\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862).Wuhan is considered by some to be one of the potential sites of the pivotal Battle of the Red Cliffs, which stopped warlord Cao Cao's incursion into southern China at the end of the Eastern Han dynasty. Other historical events taking place in Wuhan include the Wuchang Uprising of 1911, which led to the downfall of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China. Wuhan was briefly the capital of China in 1927 under the left wing of the Kuomintang (KMT) government led by Wang Jingwei. The city later served as the wartime capital of China for ten months in 1937 during the Second Sino-Japanese War. A novel coronavirus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic was first identified in Wuhan in December 2019.Wuhan is considered the political, economic, financial, commercial, cultural and educational center of Central China. It is a major transportation hub, with dozens of railways, roads and expressways passing through the city and connecting to other major cities. Because of its key role in domestic transportation, Wuhan is sometimes referred to as \"the Chicago of China\" by foreign sources. The \"Golden Waterway\" of the Yangtze River and the Han River traverse the urban area and divide Wuhan into the three districts of Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge crosses the Yangtze in the city. The Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest power station in terms of installed capacity, is located nearby. Historically, Wuhan has suffered risks of flooding, prompting the government to alleviate the situation by introducing ecologically friendly absorption mechanisms.While Wuhan has been a traditional manufacturing hub for decades, it is also one of the areas promoting modern industrial changes in China. Wuhan consists of three national development zones, four scientific and technological development parks, over 350 research institutes, 1,656 high tech enterprises, numerous enterprise incubators and investments from 230 Fortune Global 500 firms. It produced GDP of US$22.4 billion in 2018. The Dongfeng Motor Corporation, an automobile manufacturer, is headquartered in Wuhan. The city is home to multiple notable institutes of higher education, including Wuhan University and the Huazhong University of Science and Technology. In 2017, Wuhan was designated as a Creative City by UNESCO, in the field of design. Wuhan is classified as a Beta world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Wuhan\" is a portmanteau of the two major cities on the northern and southern banks of the Yangtze River that make up the Wuhan metropolis: \"Wu\" refers to the city of Wuchang (Chinese: \u6b66\u660c), which lies on the southern bank of the Yangtze, while \"Han\" refers to the city of Hankou (Chinese: \u6c49\u53e3), which lies on the northern bank of the Yangtze.\nIn 1926, the Northern Expedition reached the Wuhan area and it was decided to merge Hankou, Wuchang and Hanyang into one city in order to make a new capital for Nationalist China. On January 1, 1927, the resulting city was proclaimed as '\u6b66\u6f22' (the traditional Chinese characters for 'Wuhan'), which was later simplified as '\u6b66\u6c49' (also 'Wuhan').\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nThe Wuhan area has been settled for 3,500 years. Panlongcheng, an archaeological site primarily associated with the Erligang culture (c. 1510 \u2013 c. 1460 BC) (being sparsely populated during the earlier Erlitou period), is located in modern-day Huangpi District.\nDuring the Western Zhou the State of E, which gives its name to the single character abbreviation for Hubei province, controlled the present-day Wuchang area south of the Yangtze River. After the conquest of the E state in 863 BC, the present-day Wuhan area was controlled by the State of Chu for the rest of the Western Zhou and Eastern Zhou periods.  Chu was in turn conquered by Qin in 223 BCE.\n\n\n=== Imperial China ===\n\nDuring the Han dynasty, Hanyang became a fairly busy port. The Battle of Xiakou in AD 203 and Battle of Jiangxia five years later were fought over control of Jiangxia Commandery (present-day Xinzhou District in northeast Wuhan). In the winter of 208/9, one of the most famous battles in Chinese history and a central event in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms\u2014the Battle of Red Cliffs\u2014took place near the Yangtze River, with the cliffs near Wuhan identified as one of the potential locations. Around that time, walls were built to protect Hanyang (AD 206) and Wuchang (AD 223). The latter event marks the foundation of Wuhan. In AD 223, the Yellow Crane Tower, one of the Four Great Towers of China, was constructed on the Wuchang side of the Yangtze River by order of Sun Quan, leader of the Eastern Wu. The tower become a sacred site of Taoism.Due to tensions between the Eastern Wu and Cao Wei kingdoms, in the autumn of 228, Cao Rui, grandson of Cao Cao and the second emperor of the state of Cao Wei, ordered the general Man Chong to lead troops to Xiakou (\u590f\u53e3; in present-day Wuhan). In 279, Wang Jun and his army conquered strategic locations in Wu territory such as Xiling (in present-day Yichang, Hubei), Xiakou (\u590f\u53e3; present-day Hankou) and Wuchang (\u6b66\u660c; present-day Ezhou, Hubei).\nDuring the Northern and Southern dynasties period, the Wuhan area was part of the successive Southern dynasty states Liu Song (420\u2013479), Southern Qi (479\u2013502), Liang, and Western Liang.\nIn fall 550, Hou Jing sent Ren Yue to attack both Xiao Daxin and Xiao Fan's son Xiao Si (\u856d\u55e3).  Ren killed Xiao Si in battle, and Xiao Daxin, unable to resist, surrendered, allowing Hou to take his domain under control.  Meanwhile, Xiao Guan, who had by now settled at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan), was planning to attack Hou, but this drew Xiao Yi's ire\u2014believing that Xiao Guan was intending to contend for the throne\u2014and he sent Wang to attack Xiao Guan. In summer 567, Chen Xu commissioned Wu Mingche as the governor of Xiang Province and had him command a major part of the troops against Hua, along with Chunyu Liang (\u6df3\u4e8e\u91cf). The opposing sides met at Zhuankou (\u6c8c\u53e3, in modern Wuhan).\nThe city has long been renowned as a center for the arts (especially poetry) and for intellectual studies. Cui Hao, a celebrated poet of the Tang dynasty, visited the Yellow Crane Tower in the early 8th century; his poem made it the most celebrated building in southern China.In spring 877, Wang Xianzhi captured E Prefecture (\u9102\u5dde, in modern Wuhan).  He then returned north, joining forces with Huang again, and they surrounded Song Wei at Song Prefecture (\u5b8b\u5dde, in modern Shangqiu, Henan).  In winter 877, Huang Chao pillaged Qi and Huang (\u9ec3\u5dde, in modern Wuhan) Prefectures.\nBefore Kublai Khan arrived in 1259, word reached him that M\u00f6ngke had died. Kublai decided to keep the death of his brother secret and continued the attack on the Wuhan area, near the Yangtze. The present-day Wuying Pagoda was constructed at the end of the Song Dynasty between attacks by the Mongolian forces.  Under the Mongol rulers (Yuan dynasty) (after 1301), the Wuchang prefecture, headquartered in the town, became the capital of Hubei province. Hankou, from the Ming to late Qing, was under the administration of the local government in Hanyang, although it was already one of the four major national markets (zh:\u56db\u5927\u540d\u9547) of the Ming dynasty.\nHanyang's Guiyuan Temple was completed in the 15th year of Shunzhi (1658).By the dawn of the 18th century, Hankou had become one of China's top four most important towns of trade. In the late 19th century, railroads were extended on a north\u2013south axis through the city, making Wuhan an important transshipment point between rail and river traffic. Also during this period foreign powers extracted mercantile concessions, with the riverfront of Hankou being divided up into foreign-controlled merchant districts. These districts contained trading firm offices, warehouses, and docking facilities. The French had a concession in Hankou. During the Taiping Rebellion, the Wuhan area was controlled for many years by rebel forces and the Yellow Crane Tower, Xingfu Temple, Zhuodaoquan Temple and other buildings were repurposed or damaged. During the Second Opium War (known in the West as the Arrow War, 1856\u20131860), the government of the Qing dynasty was defeated by the western powers and signed the Treaties of Tianjin and the Convention of Peking, which stipulated eleven cities or regions (including Hankou) as trading ports. In December 1858, James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, High Commissioner to China, led four warships up the Yangtze River in Wuhan to collect the information needed for opening the trading port in Wuhan.\nIn the spring of 1861, Counselor Harry Parkes and Admiral Herbert were sent to Wuhan to open a trading port. On the basis of the Convention of Peking, Harry Parkes concluded the Hankou Lend-Lease Treaty with Guan Wen, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei. It brought an area of 30.53 square kilometers (11.79 sq mi) along the Yangtze River (from latter-day Jianghan Road to Hezuo Road) to become a British Concession and permitted Britain to set up its consulate in the concession.\n\nIn 1889, Zhang Zhidong was transferred from Viceroy of Liangguang (Guangdong and Guangxi provinces) to Viceroy of Huguang (Hunan and Hubei provinces). He governed the province for 18 years, until 1907. During this period, he elucidated the theory of \"Chinese learning as the basis, Western learning for application,\" known as the ti-yong ideal. He set up many heavy industries, founded Hanyang Steel Plant, Daye Iron Mine, Pingxiang Coal Mine and Hubei Arsenal and set up local textile industries, boosting the flourishing modern industry in Wuhan. Meanwhile, he initiated education reform, opened dozens of modern educational organizations successively, such as Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) Academy of Classical Learning, Civil General Institute, Military General Institute, Foreign Languages Institute and Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) General Normal School, and selected a great many students for study overseas, which well promoted the development of China's modern education. Furthermore, he trained a modern military and organized a modern army including a zhen and a xie (both zhen and xie are military units in the Qing dynasty) in Hubei.\nOriginally known as the Hubei Arsenal, the Hanyang Arsenal was founded in 1891 by Qing official Zhang Zhidong, who diverted funds from the Nanyang Fleet in Guangdong to build the arsenal. It cost about 250,000 pounds sterling and was built in 4 years. On 23 April 1894, construction was completed and the arsenal, occupying some 40 acres (160,000 m2), could start production of small-caliber cannons. It built magazine-fed rifles, Gruson quick fire guns, and cartridges.\n\n\n==== Wuchang Uprising ====\n\nBy 1900, according to Collier's magazine, Hankau, the Yangtze River boom town, was \"the St. Louis and Chicago of China.\" On October 10, 1911, Sun Yat-sen's followers launched the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the collapse of the Qing dynasty, as well as the establishment of the Chinese Republic.The Wuchang Uprising of October 1911, which overthrew the Qing dynasty, originated in Wuhan. Before the uprising, anti-Qing secret societies were active in Wuhan. In September 1911, the outbreak of the protests in Sichuan forced the Qing authorities to send part of the New Army garrisoned in Wuhan to suppress the rebellion. On September 14 the Literary Society (\u6587\u5b78\u793e) and the Progressive Association (\u5171\u9032\u6703), two local revolutionary organizations in Hubei, set up joint headquarters in Wuchang and planned for an uprising. On the morning of October 9, a bomb at the office of the political arrangement exploded prematurely and alerted local authorities. The proclamation for the uprising, beadroll and the revolutionaries\u2019 official seal fell into the hands of Rui Cheng, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei, who demolished the uprising headquarters the same day and set out to arrest the revolutionaries listed in the beadroll. This forced the revolutionaries to launch the uprising earlier than planned.On the night of October 10, the revolutionaries fired shots to signal the uprising at the engineering barracks of Hubei New Army. They then led the New Army of all barracks to join the revolution. Under the guidance of Wu Zhaolin, Cai Jimin and others, this revolutionary army seized the official residence of the governor and government offices. Rui Cheng fled in panic into the Chuyu ship. Zhang Biao, the commander of the Qing army, also fled the city. On the morning of the 11th, the revolutionary army took the whole city of Wuchang, but leaders such as Jiang Yiwu and Sun Wu disappeared. Thus the leaderless revolutionary army recommended Li Yuanhong, the assistant governor of the Qing army, as the commander-in-chief. Li founded the Hubei Military Government, proclaimed the abolition of the Qing rule in Hubei, the founding of the Republic of China and published an open telegram calling for other provinces to join the revolution.As the revolution spread to other parts of the country, the Qing government concentrated loyalist military forces to suppress the uprising in Wuhan. From October 17 to December 1, the revolutionary army and local volunteers defended the city in the Battle of Yangxia against better armed and more numerous Qing forces commanded by Yuan Shikai. Huang Xing would arrive in Wuhan in early November to take command of the revolutionary army. After fierce fighting and heavy casualties, Qing forces seized Hankou and Hanyang. But Yuan agreed to halt the advance on Wuchang and participated in peace talks, which would eventually lead to the return of Sun Yat-sen from exile, founding of the Republic of China on January 1, 1912. Through the Wuchang Uprising, Wuhan is known as the birthplace of the Xinhai Revolution, named after the Xinhai year on the Chinese calendar. The city has several museums and memorials to the revolution and the thousands of martyrs who died defending the revolution.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\n\nWith the northern extension of the Northern Expedition, the center of the Great Revolution shifted from the Pearl River basin to the Yangtze River basin. On November 26, the Kuomintang Central Political Committee decided to move the capital from Guangzhou to Wuhan. In mid-December, most of the KMT central executive commissioners and national government commissioners arrived in Wuhan, set up the temporary joint conference of central executive commissioners and National Government commissioners, performed the top functions of central party headquarters and National Government, declared they would work in Wuhan on January 1, 1927, and decided to combine the towns of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang into Wuhan City, called \"Capital District\". The new national government, later known as \"Wuhan nationalist government\", was based in the Nanyang Building in Hankou, while the central party headquarters and other organizations chose their locations in Hankou or Wuchang.In March 1927, Mao Zedong appeared at the Third Plenum of the KMT Central Executive Committee in Wuhan, which sought to strip General Chiang of his power by appointing Wang Jingwei leader. The first phase of the Northern Expedition was interrupted by the political split in the Kuomintang following the formation of the Nanjing faction in April 1927 against the existing faction in Wuhan. Members of the Chinese Communist Party, who had survived the April 12 massacre, met at Wuhan and reelected Chen Duxiu (Ch'en Tu-hsiu) as the Party's Secretary General. The split was partially motivated by the purge of the Communists within the party, which marked the end of the First United Front, and Chiang Kai-shek briefly stepped down as the commander of the National Revolutionary Army.In June 1927, Stalin sent a telegram to the Communists in Wuhan, calling for the mobilization of an army of workers and peasants. This alarmed Wang Jingwei, who decided to break with the Communists and come to terms with Chiang Kai-shek. The Wuhan coup was a political shift made on July 15, 1927, by Wang Jingwei towards Chiang Kai-shek, and his Shanghai-based rival in the Kuomintang. The Wuhan Nationalist Government was established in Wuhan on February 21, 1927, and ended by August 19, 1927. After the end of the Northern Expedition, Hankou was elevated to a centrally-controlled municipality.\n\nIn the 1931 China floods, one of the deadliest flood disasters in world history, Wuhan was a refuge for flood victims from outlying areas, who had been arriving since the late spring. But when the city itself was inundated in the early summer, and after a catastrophic dike failure just before 6:00 AM on July 27, an estimated 782,189 urban citizens and rural refugees were left homeless. The flood covered an area of 32 square miles and the city was flooded under many feet of water for close to three months. Large numbers gathered on flood islands throughout the city, with 30,000 sheltering on a railway embankment in central Hankou. With little food and a complete breakdown in sanitation, thousands soon began to succumb to diseases. Jin Shilong, Senior Engineer at the Hubei Flood Prevention Agency, described the flooding:There was no warning, only a sudden great wall of water. Most of Wuhan's buildings in those days were only one story high, and for many people there was no escape- they died by the tens of thousands. ... I was just coming off duty at the company's main office, a fairly new three-story building near the center of town ... When I heard the terrible noise and saw the wall of water coming, I raced to the top story of the building. ... I was in one of the tallest and strongest buildings left standing. At that time no one knew whether the water would subside or rise even higher.The high-water mark was reached on 19 August at Hankou, with the water level exceeding 16 m (53 ft) above normal. In 1936, when natural disaster struck Central China with widespread flooding affecting Hebei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Wuhan and Chongqing caused by the Yangtze and Huai Rivers bursting their banks, Ong Seok Kim, as Chairman of the Sitiawan Fundraising and Disaster Relief Committee, raised money and materials in support of the victims.\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War and following the fall of Nanking in December 1937, Wuhan had become the provisional capital of China's Kuomintang government, and became another focal point of pitched air battles beginning in early 1938 between modern monoplane bomber and fighter aircraft of the Imperial Japanese forces and the Chinese Air Force, which included support from the Soviet Volunteer Group in both planes and personnel, as U.S. support in war materials waned. As the battle raged on through 1938, Wuhan and the surrounding region had become the site of the Battle of Wuhan. After being taken by the Japanese in late 1938, Wuhan became a major Japanese logistics center for operations in southern China.\n\nIn early October 1938, Japanese troops moved east and north in the outskirts of Wuhan. As a result, numerous companies and enterprises and large numbers of people had to withdraw from Wuhan to the west of Hubei and Sichuan. The KMT navy undertook the responsibility of defending the Yangtze River on patrol and covering the withdrawal. On October 24, while overseeing the waters of the Yangtze River near the town of Jinkou (Jiangxia District in Wuhan) in Wuchang, the KMT gunboat Zhongshan came up against six Japanese aircraft. Though two were eventually shot down, the Zhongshan sank with 25 casualties. Raised from the bottom of the Yangtze River in 1997, and restored at a local shipyard, the Zhongshan has been moved to a purpose-built museum in Wuhan's suburban Jiangxia District, which opened on September 26, 2011.As a key center on the Yangtze, Wuhan was an important base for Japanese operations in China. On 18 December 1944, Wuhan was bombed by 77 American bombers that set off a firestorm that destroyed much of the city. For the next three days, Wuhan was bombed by the Americans, destroying all of the docks and warehouses of Wuhan, as well as the Japanese air bases in the city. The air raids killed thousands of Chinese civilians which American bombers did not know. \"According to casualty statistics compiled by Hankou city in 1946, more than 20,000 were killed or injured in the December bombings of 1944.\"Wuhan returned to Chinese control in September 1945. Administratively, Wuchang and Hanyang were initially combined into a new City of Wuchang, but in October 1946 were separated into the City of Wuchang (including Wuchang only) and the County of Hanyang. Hankou became a centrally controlled municipality in August 1947. Militarily, the Wuhan Forward Headquarters was established in Wuhan, headed by Bai Chongxi.\n\nDuring the later stages of the Chinese Civil War, Bai sought to broker peace, proposing that the Communist Party could rule northern China while the Nationalist government retained southern China. This was rejected, and on 15 May 1949 Bai and the Wuhan garrison retreated from the city. People's Liberation Army troops entered Wuhan on the afternoon of Monday, May 16, 1949.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n\nThe Changjiang Water Resources Commission was reestablished in February 1950 with its headquarters in Wuhan. From June to September 1954, the Yangtze River Floods were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to an unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. In 1969, a large stone monument was erected in the riverside park in Hankou honoring the heroic deeds in fighting the 1954 Yangtze River floods.\nBefore construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, Hunslet Engine Company built two extra heavy 0-8-0 locomotives for loading the train ferries for crossing the Yangtze River in Wuhan.\nThe project of building the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also known as the First Yangtze River Bridge, was regarded as one of the key projects during the first five-year plan. On October 25, 1955, construction began on the bridge proper. The same day in 1957, the whole project was completed and an opening-to-traffic ceremony was held on October 15. The First Yangtze River Bridge united the Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway with the Guangdong\u2013Hankou Railway into the Beijing\u2013Guangzhou Railway, making Wuhan a 'thoroughfare to nine provinces' (\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862) in name and in fact.\nAfter Chengdu Conference, Mao went to Chongqing and Wuhan in April to inspect the countryside and factories. In Wuhan, he called all the leaders of provinces and municipalities who had not attended Chengdu Conference to report their work. Tian Jiaying, the secretary of Mao, said that Wuhan Conference was a supplement to Chengdu Conference.In July 1967, civil strife struck the city in the Wuhan Incident (\"July 20th Incident\"), an armed conflict between two hostile groups who were fighting for control over the city at the height of the Cultural Revolution.In 1981, the Wuhan City Government commenced reconstruction of the Yellow Crane Tower at a new location, about 1 km (0.62 mi) from the original site, and it was completed in 1985. In 1957, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was built with one trestle of the bridge on the site of the tower, which had been last destroyed in 1884.During the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, students in Wuhan blocked the Yangtze River Railway bridge and another 4,000 gathered at the railway station. About one thousand students staged a railroad 'sit-in'. Rail traffic on the Beijing-Guangzhou and Wuhan-Dalian lines was interrupted. The students also urged employees of major state-owned enterprises to go on strike. The situation was so tense that residents reportedly began a bank run and resorted to panic-buying.\n\nIn the wake of the United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade on May 7, 1999, protests broke out throughout China, including in Wuhan.On June 22, 2000, a Wuhan Airlines flight from Enshi to Wuhan was forced to circle for 30 minutes due to thunderstorms. The aircraft eventually crashed on the banks of Han River in Hanyang District, all on-board perished (there were varying accounts of number of crews and passengers). In addition, the crash also killed 7 people on the ground.Chinese protesters organized boycotts of the French-owned retail chain Carrefour in major Chinese cities including Kunming, Hefei and Wuhan, accusing the French nation of pro-secessionist conspiracy and anti-Chinese racism. The BBC reported that hundreds of people demonstrated in Beijing, Wuhan, Hefei, Kunming and Qingdao. On May 19, 2011, Fang Binxing, the Principal of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (also known as \"Father of China's Great Fire Wall\") was hit on the chest by a shoe thrown at him by a Huazhong University of Science and Technology student who calls herself \"hanjunyi\" (\u5bd2\u541b\u4f9d, or \u5c0f\u6e56\u5317) while Fang was giving a lecture at Wuhan University.The city has been subject to devastating floods, which are now supposed to be controlled by the ambitious Three Gorges Dam, a project which was completed in 2008. The 2008 Chinese winter storms damaged water supply equipment in Wuhan: up to 100,000 people were out of running water when several water pipes burst, cutting the supply to local households. The 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat wave hit Wuhan on July 3.\nIn the 2010 China floods, the Han River at Wuhan experienced its worst flooding in twenty years, as officials continued sandbagging efforts along the Han and Yangtze Rivers in the city and checked reservoirs. In the 2011 China floods, Wuhan was flooded, with parts of the city losing power. In the 2016 China floods, Wuhan saw 570 mm (22 in) of rainfall during the first week of July, surpassing the record that fell on the city in 1991. A red alert for heavy rainfall was issued on 2 July, the same day that eight people died after a 15-meter (49 ft) section of a 2 m (6.6 ft) tall wall collapsed on top of them. The city's subway system, the Wuhan Metro was partially submerged as was the main railway station. At least 14 city residents were killed, one was missing, and more than 80,000 were relocated.In early July 2019, there were protests against plans for a new incinerator in Xinzhou District.The 2019 Military World Games were hosted in Wuhan in October.\nIn December 2019, an epidemic of a new coronavirus disease began in Wuhan. The disease, which became known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), spread and developed into the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Wuhan and other Hubei cities were placed under lockdown for nearly three months to contain the disease. On April 8, 2020, the Wuhan lockdown officially came to an end after no new domestic cases were reported in Hubei province.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Overview ===\n\nWuhan is in east-central Hubei, at latitude 29\u00b0 58'\u201331\u00b0 22' N and longitude 113\u00b0 41'\u2013115\u00b0 05' E. Wuhan sits at the confluence of the Han River flowing into the Yangtze River at the East of the Jianghan Plain along the Yangtze's middle reaches.\nThe metropolitan area comprises three parts\u2014Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang\u2014commonly called the \"Three Towns of Wuhan\" (hence the name \"Wuhan\", combining \"Wu\" from the first city and \"Han\" from the other two). The consolidation of these cities occurred in 1927 and Wuhan was thereby established. The three former cities face each other across the rivers and are linked by bridges, including one of the first modern bridges in China, known as the \"First Bridge\".\n\nWuchang lies South East of the Yangtze River that separates it from both Hankou and Hanyang.\nHankou sits North of the Yangtze River separating it from Wuchang. Hankou is North of the Han River separating it from Hanyang.\nHanyang lies West of the Yangtze separating it from Wuchang. Hanyang is south of the Han river separating it from Hankou.\nIt is simple in terrain \u2014 low and flat in the middle and hilly in the south, with the Yangtze and Han rivers winding through the city. The She River enters the Yangtze in Huangpi District. Wuhan occupies a land area of 8,494.41 square kilometers (3,279.71 sq mi), most of which is alluvial plain and decorated with hills and a great number of lakes and ponds. Water makes up one quarter of Wuhan's urban territory, which is the highest percentage among  major cities in China. Wuhan has nearly 200 lakes, including the East Lake of 33 km2, and Tangxun Lake, which are the largest lakes entirely within a city in China.Other well-known lakes include South Lake and Sand Lake. Liangzi Lake, the largest lake by surface area in Hubei province, is located in the southeast of Jiangxia District. At 709 m (2,326 ft) above sea level, the highest point in Wuhan is the main peak of Yunwu Mountain (\u4e91\u96fe\u5c71) in northwestern Huangpi District. There are also several mountains within the city limits of Wuhan including Mount Luojia (\u73de\u73c8\u5c71) in Wuchang District as well as Mount Hong (\u6d2a\u5c71) and Mount Yujia (\u55bb\u5bb6\u5c71/\u745c\u73c8\u5c71) in Hongshan District.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nWuhan's climate is humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) with abundant rainfall in summer and four distinctive seasons. Wuhan is known for its humid summers, when dewpoints can often reach 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) or more. Historically, along with Chongqing and Nanjing, Wuhan is referred to as one of the \"Three Furnacelike Cities\" along the Yangtze River for their hot summers. However, the climate data of recent years suggests that Wuhan is no longer among the top tier of \"The hottest cities in summer\" list, the New Four Furnacelike Cities are Chongqing, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, and Nanchang. Spring and autumn are generally mild, while winter is cool with quite low rainfall and occasional snow. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from 4.0 \u00b0C (39.2 \u00b0F) in January to 29.1 \u00b0C (84.4 \u00b0F) in July. Annual precipitation totals just under 1,320 mm (52 in), the majority of which falls from April to July; the annual mean temperature is 17.13 \u00b0C (62.8 \u00b0F), the frost-free period lasts 211 to 272 days. With monthly possible sunshine percentage ranging from 31 percent in March to 59 percent in August, the city proper receives 1,865 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extreme low and high temperatures recorded are \u221218.1 \u00b0C (\u22121 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1977 and 39.7 \u00b0C (103 \u00b0F) on 27 July 2017 (unofficial record of 41.3 \u00b0C (106 \u00b0F) in 1934).\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nWuhan is a sub-provincial city. Municipal government is regulated by the local Communist Party of China (CPC), led by the Wuhan CPC Secretary (Chinese: \u6b66\u6c49\u5e02\u59d4\u4e66\u8bb0), Wang Zhonglin (\u738b\u5fe0\u6797). The local CPC issues administrative orders, collects taxes, manages the economy, and directs a standing committee of the Municipal People's Congress in making policy decisions and overseeing the local government.\nGovernment officials include the mayor (\u5e02\u957f), Zhou Xianwang (\u5468\u5148\u65fa), and vice-mayors. Numerous bureaus focus on law, public security, and other affairs.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nThe sub-provincial city of Wuhan currently comprises 13 districts. As of the Sixth Census of China in 2010, the 13 districts comprised 160 township-level divisions including 156 subdistricts, 3 towns, 1 townships.\n\n\n=== Diplomatic missions ===\n\nThere are four countries that have consulates in Wuhan:\n\nThe current U.S. Consul General, the Honorable Mr. Jamie Fouss, was posted to Wuhan in August 2017. The office of the U.S. Consulate General, Central China (located in Wuhan) celebrated its official opening on November 20, 2008 and is the first new American consulate in China in over 20 years. The consulate is currently scheduled to offer visa and citizen services in the Fall of 2018.\nIn 2015, Japan\nand Russia announced their intentions to establish consular offices in Wuhan.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nUp until the 21st century, Wuhan was largely an agricultural region. Since 2004 it has been a focal point of the Rise of Central China Plan, which aims to build less-developed inland economies into hubs of advanced manufacturing.\nSince 1890, the steel industry has been the backbone of Wuhan's industry. In 2010, automobile industry exceeded GDP for Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO) steel for the first time. There are 5 car manufacturers, including Dongfeng Honda, Citroen, Shanghai GM, DFM Passenger Vehicle and Dongfeng Renault. Dongfeng-Citroen Automobile Co., Ltd is headquartered in the city.As of 2016, Wuhan has attracted foreign investment from over 80 countries, with 5,973 foreign-invested enterprises established in the city with a total capital injection of $22.45 billion USD. Among these, about 50 French companies including Renault and PSA Group have operations in the city, representing over one third of French investment in China, and the highest level of French investment in any Chinese city.Wuhan is an important center for economy, trade, finance, transportation, information technology, and education in China. Its major industries include optic-electronic, automobile manufacturing, iron and steel manufacturing, new pharmaceutical sector, biology engineering, new materials industry and environmental protection.  Environmental sustainability is highlighted in Wuhan's list of emerging industries, which include energy efficiency technology and renewable energy.\n\n\n=== Industrial zones ===\nMajor industrial zones in Wuhan include in chronological order:\n\nWuhan Economic and Technological Development ZoneWuhan Economic and Technological Development Zone is a national level industrial zone incorporated in 1993. Its current zone size is about 10\u201325 square km and it plans to expand to 25\u201350 square km. Industries encouraged in Wuhan Economic and Technological Development Zone include Auto-mobile Production/Assembly, Biotechnology/Pharmaceuticals, Chemicals Production and Processing, Food/Beverage Processing, Heavy Industry, and Telecommunications Equipment.\n\nWuhan Export Processing ZoneWuhan Export Processing Zone was established in 2000. It is located in Wuhan Economic and Technology Development Zone, planned to cover 2.7 square kilometers (1.0 square mile) of land. The first 0.7-square-kilometer (0.3-square-mile) area has already been created.\nWuhan Donghu New Technology Development ZoneWuhan Donghu New Technology Development Zone is a national level high-tech development zone. Optical-electronics, telecommunications, and equipment manufacturing are the core industries of Wuhan East Lake High-Tech Development Zone (ELHTZ) while software outsourcing and electronics are also encouraged. ELHTZ is China's largest production center for optoelectronic products with key players like Yangtze Optical Fiber and Cable, (the largest fiber-optical cable maker in China), and Fiberhome Telecommunications. Wuhan Donghu New Technology Development Zone also represents the development center for China's laser industry with key players such as HG Tech and Chutian Laser being based in the zone.\nWuhan Optical Valley (Guanggu) Software ParkWuhan Optical Valley (Guanggu) Software Park is located in Wuhan Donghu New Technology Development Zone. Wuhan Optics Valley Software Park is jointly developed by East Lake High-Tech Development Zone and Dalian Software Park Co., Ltd. The planned area is 0.67 square kilometers (0.26 square miles) with total floor area of 6,000,000 square meters (65,000,000 square feet). The zone is 8.5 km (5.28 mi) away from the 316 National Highway and is 46.7 km (29.02 mi) away from the Wuhan Tianhe Airport.\n\nWuhan BiolakeBiolake is an industrial base established in 2008 in the Optics Valley of China. Located in East Lake New Technology Development Zone of Wuhan, Biolake covers 15 km2 (5.8 sq mi), and has six parks including Bio-innovation Park, Bio-pharma Park, Bio-agriculture Park, Bio-manufacturing Park, Medical Device Park and Medical Health Park, to accommodate both research activities and living.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nWuhan is the most populous city in Central China and among the most populous in China.  In the Sixth Census of China in 2010, Wuhan's built-up area made of 8 out of 10 urban districts (all but Xinzhou and Hannan not yet conurbated) was home to 8,821,658 inhabitants. As of 2015, the city of Wuhan had an estimated population of 10,607,700 people.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 19 million.\nAs of November 2019, urban development status considering both spatial and socioeconomic processes has been examined using Night Time Lighting data and land cover data as proxies; it showed Wuhan's high concentration\nof socioeconomic activities compared to its urban spatial development.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nAccording to a survey published in 2017, 79.2% of the population of Wuhan are either irreligious or practice worship of gods and ancestors; among these 0.9% are Taoists. Among other religious doctrines, 14.7% of the population adheres to Buddhism, 2.9% to Protestantism, 0.3% to Catholicism and 1.6% to Islam, and 1.6% of the population adheres to unspecified other religions.\nReligious sites in Wuhan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nChina Railway Wuhan Group manages the Wuhan Railway Hub. Wuhan Railway Hub is considered one of the four key railway hubs of China. The city of Wuhan is served by three major railway stations: the Hankou Railway Station in Hankou, the Wuchang Railway Station in Wuchang, and the Wuhan Railway Station, located in a newly developed area east of the East Lake (Hongshan District). As the stations are many miles apart, it is important for passengers to be aware of the particular station(s) used by a particular train.\nThe (original) Hankou Station was the terminus for the Jinghan Railway from Beijing, while the Wuchang Station was the terminus for the Yuehan Railway to Guangzhou. Since the construction of the First Yangtze Bridge and the linking of the two lines into the Jingguang Railway, both Hankou and Wuchang stations have been served by trains going to all directions, which contrasts with the situation in such cities as New York or Moscow, where different stations serve different directions.\nWith the opening of the Hefei-Wuhan high-speed railway on April 1, 2009, Wuhan became served by high-speed trains with Hefei, Nanjing, and Shanghai; several trains a day now connect the city with Shanghai, getting there in under 6 hours. As of early 2010, most of these express trains leave from the Hankou Railway Station.\n\nIn 2006, construction began on the new Wuhan Railway Station with 11 platforms, located on the northeastern outskirts of the city. In December 2009, the station was opened, as China unveiled its second high-speed train with scheduled runs from Guangzhou to Wuhan. Billed as the fastest train in the world, it can reach a speed of 394 km/h (244.82 mph). The travel time between the two cities has been reduced from ten and a half hours to just three. The rail service has been extended north to Beijing.As of 2011, the new Wuhan Railway Station is primarily used by the Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed trains, while most regular trains to other destinations continue to use the Hankou and Wuchang stations.\n\nConstruction work is carried out on several lines of the new Wuhan Metropolitan Area Intercity Railway, which will eventually connect Wuhan's three main rail terminals with several stations throughout the city's outer areas and farther suburbs, as well as with the nearby cities of Xianning, Huangshi, Huanggang, and Xiaogan. The first line of the system, the one to Xianning, opened for passenger operations at the end of 2013. The line to Xiaogen opened on 1 December 2016 and it was extended with the opening of the Wuhan\u2013Shiyan high-speed railway to Shiyan on 29 November 2019.The main freight railway station and classification yard of the Wuhan metropolitan area is the extensive Wuhan North railway station, with 112 tracks and over 650 switches. It is located in Hengdian Subdistrict of Huangpi District, located 20 km (12 mi) north of the Wuhan Station and 23 km (14 mi) from Hankou Station.\n\n\n=== Wuhan Metro ===\n\nWuhan Metro is a rapid transit system serving the city of Wuhan. Owned and operated by Wuhan Metro Group Co., Ltd., the network now includes 9 lines, 228 stations, and 339 km (211 mi) of route length. Line 1, the first line in the system, opened on 28 July 2004, which made Wuhan became the seventh city in mainland China with rapid transit system, after Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Changchun, and Dalian. Line 2 opened on 28 December 2012 and is the first underground metro line crossing the Yangtze River. With 1.22 billion annual passengers in 2019, Wuhan Metro is the sixth-busiest rapid transit system in mainland China. There are a number of lines or sections under construction. The government of Wuhan City promised the citizens that at least two lines or sections open every year. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire network was out of service from 23 January to 27 March 2020.\n\n\n=== Trams ===\n\nTrams were brought to the streets of Wuhan on July 28, 2017 with the first line (Auto-city T1 Line) opened that day. The trams under construction or planning in Wuhan are:\n\nAuto-city trams, with Lines T1, T2, T6, and T8 in the Wuhan Economic Development Area, in the far western reaches on Hanyang. T1 Line is operational as of 2017.\nOptics Valley trams, two lines  (T1 and T2) south and east of Guanggu Circle (Guanggu Guangchang) in southeastern Wuchang. The system opened on January 18, 2018.\nThe Old Hankou Streetcar, a loop line around Hankou city.\n\n\n=== Maritime transport ===\nWuhan is a major hub for maritime transport in central China. The Port of Wuhan provide services for the local population and shipping services.\n\n\n=== Ferry ===\nAs a city located at bank of Yangtze River, Wuhan has long history of ferry services. Modern ferry services were established in 1900 by steam boat. In 1937, a train ferry was established to transport train cars from Hankou to Wuchang. There are numbered stops around Wuhan where people can get on and off the ferry and there is a tourist ferry in the night.\nCurrently, ferry services are provided by the Wuhan Ferry Company. In 2010, the company bought 10 new ships to replace the ones that had been in service for 29 years.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nOpened in April 1995 to substitute for the old Hankou Wangjiadun Airport and Nanhu Airport as the major airport of Wuhan, Wuhan Tianhe International Airport is one of the busiest airports in central China. It is located in Wuhan's suburban Huangpi District 26 kilometers (16 mi) north of Wuhan city proper. The extension of Line 2 of Wuhan Metro to Tianhe Airport opened on 28 December 2016. It has also been selected as China's fourth international hub airport after Beijing Capital International Airport, Shanghai-Pudong and Guangzhou Baiyun. A second terminal was completed in March 2008, having been started in February 2005 with an investment of CNY 3.372 billion. International flights to neighboring Asian countries have also been enhanced, including direct flights to Tokyo and Nagoya, Japan. Terminal 3 has been available for service since early 2017.\nHannan Municipal Airport is an municipal airport that serves Hannan District. It is the biggest airport in China that only handles general aviation, and the biggest municipal airport in Hubei Province. Caidian Municipal Airport is an under-construction airport which will serve Caidian District. The airport began construction on 1 December 2017.\n\n\n=== Highways and expressways ===\nNumerous major highways and expressways pass through Wuhan, including:\n\nChina National Highway 107\nChina National Highway 316\nChina National Highway 318\nG42 Shanghai\u2013Chengdu Expressway\nG0422 Wuhan\u2013Shenzhen Expressway\n\n\n=== Bicycle-sharing system ===\nAs of May 2011, the Wuhan and Hangzhou Public Bicycle bike-share systems in China were the largest in the world, with around 90,000 and 60,000 bicycles respectively. In 2012 the Wuhan and Hangzhou Public Bicycle programs in China are the largest in the world, with around 90,000 and 60,000 bicycles respectively. China has seen a rise in private \"dockless\" bike shares with fleets that dwarf systems in size outside China. Initially, a number of traditional (third generation) docked public bike systems operated by local municipal governments opened across China, with the largest ones being in Wuhan and Hangzhou.  The first was introduced in Beijing in 2007.  However, third generation bike sharing is not considered successful for the majority cities in China.  Bike sharing in Beijing virtually stopped and it also has encountered difficulties in Shanghai and Wuhan.\n\n\n== Destinations ==\n\nThe Yellow Crane Tower (Huanghelou) is presumed to have been first built in approximately 220 AD.

Tortoise Mountain TV Tower is China's first self-developed TV tower, opened in 1986. The modern newspapers in Wuhan can be dated back to 1866, when Hankow Times, a newspaper in English, was founded. Before 1949, more than 50 newspapers and magazines were published by foreigners in Wuhan. Chao-wen Hsin-pao, founded by Ai Xiaomei in 1873, was the first Chinese newspaper to appear in Hankou (one of the cities that was merged into Wuhan).

Chutian Metropolis Daily and Wuhan Evening News are two major local commercial tabloid newspapers. Both of them have entered the list of 100 most widely circulated newspapers of the world.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe plum blossom is the city's emblem, chosen partly because of the long history of local plum cultivation and use, and partly to recognize the plum's current economic significance in terms of cultivation and research.

Some traditional new year customs revolve around the planting of plums.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nWuhan natives speak a variety of Southwestern Mandarin Chinese referred to as Wuhan dialect that differs slightly between the districts of Wuhan, including Wuchang dialect in Wuchang District, Hankou dialect in the Hankou districts, Hanyang dialect in Hanyang District, and Qingshan dialect in Qingshan District.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nHubei cuisine is one of China's ten major styles of cooking. With a history of more than 2,000 years, Hubei cuisine, originating in ancient Chu cuisine, has developed a number of distinctive dishes, such as steamed blunt-snout bream in clear soup, preserved ham with flowering Chinese cabbage, and others. On the third day of the third month of the lunar calendar, many in Wuhan eat d\u00ecc\u00e0i zh\u01d4 j\u012bd\u00e0n (\u5730\u83dc\u716e\u9e21\u86cb), an egg dish which is supposed to prevent illness in the coming year.\"No need to be particular about the recipes; all foods have their own uses. Rice wine and tangyuan are excellent midnight snacks, while fat bream and flowering Chinese cabbages are great delicacies.\" This attitude expressed in Hankou Zhuzhici reflects indirectly the eating habits and a wide variety of distinctive snacks with a long history in Wuhan, such as Qingshuizong (a pyramid-shaped dumpling made of glutinous rice wrapped in bamboo or reed leaves) in the Period of the Warring States, Chunbinbian in Northern and Southern dynasties, mung bean jelly in the Sui dynasty, youguo (a deep-fried twisted dough stick) in the Song and Yuan dynasties, rice wine and mianwo in the Ming and Qing dynasties, as well as three-delicacy stuffed skin of bean milk, tangbao (steamed dumpling filled with minced meat and gravy) and hot braised noodles (reganmian) in modern times.\nGuozao (\u904e\u65e9) is a popular way to say 'having breakfast' in Wuhan, and a part of the city's culture. As a hub for land transport in China, Wuhan has gathered and mixed together various habits and customs from neighboring cities and provinces in all directions, which gives rise to a concentration of diverse cuisines from different places. The most famous place to guozao (have breakfast) is Hubu Street (\u6236\u90e8\u5df7), a 150-meter-long street in the neighborhood of Simenkou (\u53f8\u95e8\u53e3). Along its short length one can find nearly all the traditional foods of Wuhan, such as:\n\nHot and dry noodles, re-gan mian (\u70ed\u5e72\u9762), consists of long freshly boiled noodles mixed with sesame paste. It is considered to be the most typical local food for breakfast.\nDuck's neck or Ya Bozi (\u9e2d\u8116\u5b50) is a local version of this popular Chinese dish, made of duck necks and spices.\nBean skin or doupi (\u8c46\u76ae) is a local dish with a filling of egg, rice, beef, mushrooms and beans cooked between two large round soybean skins and cut into pieces, structurally like a stuffed pizza without enclosing edges.\nSoup dumpling or xiaolongtangbao (\u5c0f\u7b3c\u6c64\u5305) is a kind of dumpling with thin skin made of flour, steamed with very juicy meat inside, hence the name: tang (soup) bao (bun) \u2013 every time one takes a bite from it the \"soup\" inside is liable to spill out.\nA salty doughnut or mianwo (\u9eaa\u7aa9) is a kind of savory donut with a salty taste. It is much thinner than a common donut and is a typical Wuhan local food.\n\n\n=== Opera ===\nHan opera, which is the local opera of Wuhan area, was one of China's oldest and most popular operas. During the late Qing dynasty, Han opera, blended with Hui opera, gave birth to Peking opera, the most popular opera in modern China. Thus Han opera has been called the \"mother of Peking opera.\"\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nWuhan has a professional football team, Wuhan Zall F.C., that plays in the Chinese Super League. Xinhua Road Sport Center, the team's home stadium, with a capacity of 32,137, is located in the heart of the city next to Zhongshan Park. For the 2013 season, Wuhan Zall was promoted to the top-tier league of Chinese football, Chinese Super League, and relocated its home to Wuhan Sports Center Stadium, a modern stadium with 54,357 seats located in the suburbs of the city. However, the team did not play well in the ensuing season and was demoted back to China League One as the 2013 season ended. For financial and transportation reasons, the team moved back to Xinhua Road Sport Center in 2014.\nThe Wuhan Gators are a professional arena football team based in Wuhan.

The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also called the First Bridge, was built over the Yangtze in 1957, carrying a railroad directly across the river between hills known as Snake Hill and Turtle Hill. Before this bridge was built it could take up to an entire day to barge railcars across. Including its approaches, it is 5,511 feet (1,680 m) long, and it accommodates both a double-track railway on a lower deck and a four-lane roadway above. It was built with the assistance of advisers from the Soviet Union.\nThe Second Bridge, a cable-stayed bridge built of prestressed concrete, has a central span of 400 meters (1,300 feet); it is 4,678 meters (15,348 feet) in length (including 1,877 meters (6,158 feet) of the main bridge) and 26.5 to 33.5 meters (86.9 to 109.9 feet) in width. Its main bridgeheads are 90 meters (300 feet) high each, pulling 392 thick slanting cables together in the shape of double fans so that the central span of the bridge is well poised on the piers and the bridge's stability and vibration resistance are ensured. With six lanes on the deck, the bridge is designed to handle the daily passage of 50,000 motor vehicles. The bridge was completed in 1995.\n\nThe Third Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also called Baishazhou Bridge, was completed in September 2000. Located 8.6 kilometers (5.3 miles) southwest of the First Bridge, construction of Baishazhou Bridge started in 1997. With an investment of over 1.4 billion yuan (about US$170,000,000), the bridge, which is 3,586 meters (11,765 feet) long and 26.5 meters (86.9 feet) wide, has six lanes and has a capacity of 50,000 vehicles a day. The bridge is expected to serve as a major passage for the future Wuhan Ring Road, greatly easing the city's traffic and aiding local economic development.\nThe Yangluo Bridge carries Wuhan's Ring Road across the Yangtze in the city's eastern suburbs (connecting the Hongshan District with the Xinzhou District). It was opened on December 26, 2007.\nThe Wuhan Tianxingzhou Yangtze River Bridge crosses the Yangtze in the northeastern part of the city, downstream of the Second bridge. It is named after Tianxing Island (Tianxingzhou), above which it crosses the river. Built at a cost of 11 billion yuan, the 4,657-meter cable suspension bridge was opened on December 26, 2009, in time for the opening of the Wuhan Railway Station. It is a combined road and rail bridge, and carries the Wuhan\u2013Guangzhou High-Speed Railway across the river.\n\n\n=== Skyscrapers ===\n\nThe Yellow Crane Tower, historically one of the tallest buildings in Wuhan, is considered one of the Four Great Towers of China and was destroyed twelve times, both by warfare and by fire. The tower is classified as an AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration. At 438 meters (1,437 ft) in height, the Wuhan Center skyscraper, the tallest structure in Wuhan and in Central China, is the eighth tallest structure in China. The Minsheng Bank Building, the second tallest structure in Wuhan, was the tallest building in Wuhan when it was completed in 2007. It retained the title until Wuhan Center surpassed it in 2014. Wuhan World Trade Tower is a 273-meter (896 foot) tall skyscraper located in Wuhan. It became the tallest building in Wuhan after its completion in 1998. However, it was surpassed by the Minsheng Bank Building in 2007.\nThe Wuhan Greenland Center is a planned 636-meter (2,087 ft), 126-floor mixed-use skyscraper currently under construction and scheduled for completion in 2019. If completed as planned, it will be among the world's tallest structures, and one of the world's tallest buildings by occupiable floor height. The Phoenix Towers are proposed supertall skyscrapers planned for construction in Wuhan.

          "The bridge gives a good reason to visit however the experience is pretty compact and should not be considered as attraction. Go there when you have nothing else to do...",
          "This is an enjoyable bridge to walk over the Yangtze River, and watch the river traffic of barges and ships",
          "Beautiful bridge across the river . Connecting old and new city . Good to watch during evening with lights on .",
          "Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is huge and grand especially at night view, it looks more beautiful. We had visited the bridge at day and night but of course Night view with lights on looks more beautiful.",
          "during daylight a bridge as other ones, Needs to be visited during nightlight. That's nice and a must to do",
          "A must visit if you have enough time in Wuhan. By ferry crossing then walk to the bridge, cross the bridge on foot is wonderful experience n views of both sides of Wuchang n Hankou sides on sunny clear day or night views are beautiful too. Standing above the Yangtse river is",
          "My girlfriend took me to the Yangtze river bridge. We had just got engaged and she told me of an old Chinese custom for all newly engaged or just married couples. \"Walk across bridge holding hands together and stay together forever. That was the first thing we did after I asked",
          "Was there surprisingly on 7 Aug 2016, very hot and humid but still went on the bridge. Took a grandiose view you can see the Chang Xiang that has no boundaries! Overall, I enjoyed taking some great time there despite the humid and muggy weather that's common place for China in",
          "It is a little hard to get onto the bridge at night, one one end there is a nice set of stairs but to get down to our hotel we had a bit of an adventure through a smaller village inside the city to locate the main road underneath. I am sure that there is another way but it was",
          "It's a just a bridge and the traffic is terrible so this is not something I recommend going out specifically to see. That said if you travel around Wuhan to see the sites at some point you will most likely have an opportunity to cross and see this histrocial bridge.",
          "The bridge is one of the major icons of Wuhan, I would recommend taking the boat over from Wuchang then walking along the banks of the river in Hanyang. It is especially pretty at night with the bridge lit up alternating different colors.",
          "Huge bridge took and hour and a half to walk across ,well worth the time. But took a bus back to Wuhan",
          "I would not recommend anyone, especially tourists come over to visit this bridge. It is just another bridge in China. Instead, I would recommend tourists take ferry to cross over the YangTze River, maybe you would have more excitement.",
          "This bridge is an easy walk from the Yellow Crane Tower and provides great views of life on the river below. Otherwise, as an attraction, it doesn't hold a great deal of interest unless you have a particular interest in bridges!",
          "Much nicer to look at than some of the steel bridges over the river, this bridge looks solid. Great looking towers on each side of the river banks, you great a good view of the vehicle traffic from the top of the Yellow Crane Tower which is a 10 minute walk away from the south",
          "On both sides of the river, you will see tower-like structures that're part of the bridge (it's shown on the photo for the attraction here in tripadvisor). That's where you can take a lift up to the top and you can walk across to the other side of the river. You basically have",
          "The oldest bridge in Wuhan crossing the Yangtze River. The history and the old-fashioned style are quite interesting, although the view would not be so magnificent. You wound find large boats in the river, going beneath the bridge, with the distance hundreds of miles away from",
          "We walked across the bridge on a cold, windy day. It was interesting to see the bridge and the river. The park on the waters edge had sculptures that were interesting. Relaxing walk in the park.",
          "After all it is just a bridge in crowded city. There is not much more to see. The high rank comes mostly from the fact that it plays some role in chinese history - but if you have no idea about it is just a bridge.",
          "This river is filled with History... It is so clean and well kept. A must see when in Wuhan.Yangtze River has a history of over 2500 years, whose culture is rich and colorful, highlighted by ethnic minority culture. The Yangtze River has an important place in Chinese history.",
          "I was there in April for Wuhan marathon and have been introduce to this bridge as a must see destination of Wuhan. The bridge is developed by Soviet Engineers and it can be seen thought structure and architecture. The best time to see the bridge is evening as you can also chance",
          "The first bridge to cross the Yangtze, built by the Russians way back when China and Russia were best buds. If you are interested in bridges or engineering, then this is a must see. If you simply value good views of rivers with busy cargo ships going up and down the river or",
          "I realize that this was built without the modern machinery of today but I was not as amazed as I have been with other feats of construction in china. I can say I saw it. still to me just a bridge",
          "The visit to the bridge can be easily arranged after a visit to Yellow Crane Tower. After you come out of the front entrance of the Yellow Crane Tower (facing the Yangtze River), then you are almost on the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. Watching the guards, take a paid lift from",
          "Yangtze River is stunning. And besides the hotel along the bund, this bridge is another great place to check out the river. There's also a pier near the bridgehead of Wuchang which offer the ferry service between Wuchang and Houkou",
          "Had a great view on Yangtze river from my Marco Polo hotel window. Along the river there're lot of night life places and lovely nature areas.",
          "Wuhan Yangtze river bridge or Changjiang bridge span almost 2.5kM from end to end.This is an awesome and a must visit place of attraction in Wuhan.It's a breathtaking view atop of this bridge.Unlike other attraction Wuhan Yangtze river bridge is open 24/7 and it's free of",
          "Built by the Russians, this was the first bridge over de Yellow River. Good view over the mighty river.",
          "I took a walk on the riverside road and it is amazing during the evening with all the lights on the bridge and across the river. The walkway is not packed at all and it was really peaceful.",
          "This site is just below the Yellow Crane Tower and views from the bridge are very good. Usually the foot traffic on weekends makes it crowded. Fumes from the traffic can be intense.",
          "We had a nice walk along the gardens where we saw the sculptures and we're able to learn of the legend of Yu. The bridge is quite spectacular from below. Look our for the cherry blossoms along the way at this time of the year",
          "For a comfortable walk, a view of Wuhan and an opportunity to meet and chat with fellow walkers, walk both ways. Allow and hour for a fast walk both ways or 2 hours for a casual, photo stop, and interact with other walkers.",
          "Nice walk across the bridge to the Yellow Crane tower. Lots of options for pictures. Enjoy the walk, and the views.",
          "Good spot for photos of the river, and some interesting history regarding the building of the bridge",
          "The area was great, getting a real feel of Wuhan and it's Culture. The bars were great, live music and food is excellent and so reasonable. I can't wait to go back.",
          "First bridge built over the Yangzi river with support from USSR, it is only roughly 55 years old at the end. Nothing exceptionnal for this bridge if we compare with the ones in other countries. It is only symbolism.",
          "A beautiful structure across a major body of water that provides a lifeline in China. It was a work of engineering artistry. Even took a cruise on the river. Very enjoyable!",
          "Took us 45 minutes to walk across. Amazed to see how well the bicycles, cars, buses all flow in the traffic without having a crash! There was a bus shelter at one end of the bridge. We hailed for a taxi whilst standing at the bus shelter on the bridge, not knowing if we would",
          "Sure it is impressive; quite long and Wuhan was one of the first cities to have a bridge over the Yangtze River and Chairman Mao did go for his famous \"swim\" there years ago (but if you watch the replay which is available on DVD to purchase you will see it is more of a drift",
          "If you can, walk across the bridge rather than travelling across it by car, which most tour companies will do. Just watching the river flow underneath and seeing the size of the Yangtze with its myriad of boats is fascinating.",
          "I walked across the bride from south to north which was a great experience. Not sure if I missed some kind of way out, but eventually I had to walk a long way after the bridge to get to a place to stop a taxi. I think most People just walk half way and then go back to the south",
          "Really enjoyed our walk across the bridge, some excellent views when the smog was not heavy. The Yellow Crane Tower is at the end of the bridge and there is parking nearby plus trolley bus and regular bus services to each end.",
          "To reach there we used a bus \u211610 from Wuchang Railway station (passing the Yellow Crane tower, crossing the bridge and get out of the nearest station after). To get out we used bus \u2116803 - 4 stations from Holiday Inn to take green subway line. This place is a good choice to",
          "I want to walk crossing this bridge, since this river is very famous, from elementary school yangtze river (or sometimes called changjiang river) always mentioned. maybe what makes this bridge is not special to visit is because nothing to expect at the end of the bridge, just",
          "It is a famous construction in the city and the bridge is big,.. But at the end it is just a bridge. We had a smoggy day so the views were not that good,... I can imagine at a clear day it is much nicer.",
          "OK if you are an engineer as I am you will be impressed with this bridge that was started by the Russians but finished by the Chinese. It is large and supports a railway track and above it a road. The size allows you to scale the size of the river and it is a great point to take",
          "Our hosts took us to the bridge and then choose to drive very slowly across to the obvious frustration of other users, who sounded their horns as we moved across (however the rules of driving in China defy description!). Having reached the other bank we parked and walked to the",
          "You can get some nice views over the river, but its a bridge with heavy traffic traveling along it all day everyday, not exactly a scenic spot for a picnic!",
          "I visited this bridge in 2010, and then again on my last visit to Wuhan in October, 2014. It should not be missed. It's hard to describe the feeling when you are looking at it, but it's a very beautiful area, evoking tranquility, history, and culture, with many sculptures",
          "I crossed this bridge by car, by bicycle and on foot and just because some people say it's an attraction does not make it one. The bridge has no unique design or engineering... the guards in the guard booths are the most interesting part and won't let you take their picture.",
          "Certainly not worth a trip of it's own, but if you are already going to the Yellow Crane Tower and want to take a small detour, it has a nice view.",
          "We were touring and took a boat ride beneath the bridge last May and it was a misty view as we approached it. We didn't get to walk across it. It was apparently the first bridge across the Yangtze for trains, cars and people. It was a huge concrete structure - it wouldn't win",
          "It was a clear sunny day, and a perfect day to walk over this bridge. The views were nice, but knowing I was actually crossing the Yangtze was what thrilled me most. It also gave me the chance to see the yellow crane tower for the very first time. All in all it was a nice walk",
          "This is the first bridge over yangtze river, built by Chinese but under the consultancy of Russian engineers. Very solid bridge, and even better quality than most of the recent bridges built in the last 20 years. Worth walking from turtle hill to snake hill, if not foggy.",
          "This was the original Yangtze River bridge built in Wuhan in the 1950's, with the upper level devoted to cars and the lower level to trains. We were staying at the Holiday Inn Riverside that is within walking distance of the bridge, we also drove across the bridge to visit the",
          "That\u00b4s all I can say. It\u00b4s a bridge. A long bridge. What more? If you\u00b4re for any reason closeby, ok go and see. If not, does not worth any effort.",
          "It is a nice place see the sunset in Wuhan. Most important, it is free of charge and can be reached easily by many routes of public bus!",
          "Not the most beautiful bridge. Guess it's fame is due to it's Russian technology in 50's and being the 1st bridge of it's kind. Took a bus from yellow crane tower entrance (non-staircase one) and cross the bridge. Not bad.",
          "Ok so it's a bridge... though if you're like me and the biggest river you'd ever seen before this is the Murray then you're pretty amazed by the size of the River. Wuhan itself is a crazy, busy and I dare say dirty city.",
          "If you want to see a bridge then fantastic. That is all. Okay to walk over but quite long: I would recommend getting the ferry across the river for 2 kuai instead.",
          "the brdige is awesome. if you wanna walk, tat will be super awesome but there is a bridge foot walk fee and its pretty expensive. but bear in mind, this is the longest bridge ober the Yangtze. take a normal public bus and u will still feel the buzz.",
          "We were there middle day and it was hot so we didn't spend a lots of time there. We totally enjoyed the boat ride and saw the two rivers",
          "Well - this is i a long and old bridge and is very impressing - especially if you think of the time it was built... but actually the park underneath it on the Hanyang side is also nice",
          "I believe this is 1st Bridge and it is very near The Yellow Crane Tower. It is a favorite for people to walk across and under the foot of the WuChang side is a great little street that has lots of specialty & nick knack shops and large wonderful food vendor ally area where you",
          "As we know wuhan city is combained with three parts ,hankou hanyang and wuchang.Hanyang and wuchan is commbined with this bridge.the bridge has two floors the first floor is for bus and the second floor is for train.The bridge was build in 1956 with the help of fomer Russia.the",
          "joining the average people and dancing under the great bridge with all kinds of colour of lights reflect inside the water ....so relaxed that you can forget all the pain or unhappy moments in the day and smile to what life has given us!",
          "It's a bridge, the first one across the Yangtze, built during the 50s. It's nothing special. It's not the Golden Gate. See it best from Yellow Crane Tower on a clear day. Your best chance of that is in the spring or fall after a good rain.",
          "The bridge is nice from a distance. Walk along the Yangtze river with a great view of the bridge. Great for pictures around sunset.",
          "\"Da Qiao\", or the First Bridge of Yangtze River in Wuhan, was built in the late 50s when my parents were born. Today it still stands grand and firm as a major transportation route across the big river. The bridge is almost at the center of old Wuhan city and conveniently located",

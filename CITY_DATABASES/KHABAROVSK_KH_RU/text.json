It is located in the Central District and intersects with Gogolya Street, Turgyeneva Street, Karl Marx Street, and Glory Square, Muravyova-Amurskogo Street. Itbos currently the location for main city events and celebrations.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was created in 1864 as Nikolaevskaya square. In 1917, it was renamed Freedom Square. In 1925, a monument to Vladimir Lenin was placed in the center of the square. In 1949, architect E. Mameshin developed a project for the planning and development of the square which included a modern medical university. In 1950, it was renamed Stalin Square and began to host International Workers Day and October Revolution Day civil/military parades for the first time. In 1957 the square was renamed Lenin square. In 1998 the square underwent a final reconstruction.\n\n\n== Notable buildings ==\nThe architectural appearance of the building area is diverse, with different buildings including:\n\nFar Eastern State Medical University\nFar East Institute of Management\nDalcombank Headquarters\nGovernment of the Khabarovsk Krai (known as the White House)\nJunker College\nCentral HotelThe entire square and its architectural structures is 25,300 square metres (272,000 sq ft) meters in size.\n\n\n== Lenin statue ==\nAfter the establishment of Soviet power in the Russian Far East, local newspapers suggested that a monument to Vladimir Lenin be erected in Khabarovsk on the anniversary of his death (22 January) in 1925. The process of construction began under the direction of People's Artist of the RSFSR M. Manizer from Moscow. The height of the monument together with the pedestal was 6.67 meters, with three bronze plaques with quotes from Lenin being fixed onto the pedestal. During its first reconstruction in 1950, the monument was moved from the center of the square to the building of the former school, making stands on either side. In the 1990s, attempts were made to remove the monument, however was completely ignored by the local government.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of things named after Vladimir Lenin\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "FC Dynamo Moscow (Dinamo Moscow, FC Dinamo Moskva, Russian: \u0414\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0301\u043c\u043e \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430\u0301 [d\u02b2\u026a\u02c8nam\u0259 m\u0250\u02c8skva]) is a Russian football club based in Moscow. Dynamo has returned to the Russian Premier League for the 2017\u201318 season after one season in the second-tier Russian Football National League.Dynamo was the only club that had always played in the top tier of Soviet football (along with Dynamo Kyiv) and of Russian football from the end of the Soviet era until they were relegated in 2016. Despite this, it has never won the modern Russian Premier League title and won Russian Cup only once, in the season of 1994\u201395.\nDuring the Soviet era, it was affiliated with the MVD (Ministry of Internal Affairs \u2013 The Soviet Militia) and with the KGB and was a part of Dynamo sports society. Chief of the Soviet security and secret police apparatus NKVD, Lavrentiy Beria, was a patron of the club until his downfall.\nFrom 10 April 2009 the VTB Bank has been the owner of Dynamo after acquiring a 74% share in the club. Boris Rotenberg Sr. was chairman until he resigned on 17 July 2015. On 29 December 2016, Dynamo Sports Society agreed to buy VTB Bank shares back for 1 ruble. On 14 February 2019, Dynamo Sports Society agreed to sell the club back to VTB for 1 ruble.Dynamo's traditional colours are blue and white. Their crest consists of a blue letter \"D,\" written in a traditional cursive style on a white background, with \"Moscow\" written below it, partially covering a football underneath. The club's motto is \"Power in Motion,\" initially proposed by Maxim Gorky, the famous Russian author, who was once an active member of the Dynamo sports society.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nDynamo Moscow has its roots in the football Club Sokolniki Moscow.\nAfter the Russian Revolution, the club eventually found itself under the authority of the Interior Ministry and its head Felix Dzerzhinsky, chief of the Cheka, the Soviet Union's secret police. The club was renamed Dynamo Moscow in 1923 but was also referred to disparagingly as \"garbage\", a Russian criminal slang term for \"police\", by some of the supporters of other clubs.\nDynamo won the first two Soviet Championships in 1936 and 1937, a Soviet Cup in 1937, and another pair of national titles in 1940 and 1945. They were also the first Soviet club to tour the West when it played a series of friendlies in the United Kingdom in 1945. Complete unknowns to the British, the Soviet players first drew 3\u20133 against Chelsea and then defeated Cardiff City 1\u201310. They defeated an Arsenal side reinforced with Stanley Matthews, Stan Mortensen and Joe Bacuzzi by a score of 3\u20134 in a match played in thick fog at White Hart Lane. They drew 2\u20132 against Scottish side Rangers.\nThey continued to be a strong side at home after World War II, and enjoyed their greatest success through the 1950s. Dynamo captured another five championships between 1949 and 1959, as well as their second Soviet Cup in 1953. Honours were harder to come by after that time. The club continued to enjoy some success in the Soviet Cup, but has not won a national championship since 1976. Even so, Dynamo's 11 national titles make it the country's third-most decorated side behind Dynamo Kyiv (13 titles) and Spartak Moscow (12 titles).\nDynamo's greatest achievement in Europe was in the 1971\u201372 European Cup Winners' Cup, where they reached the Final at Camp Nou in Barcelona, losing 3\u20132 to Rangers. This was the first time a Russian side had reached a final in a European competition, a feat not repeated until CSKA Moscow won the UEFA Cup in 2005.\n\n\n=== VTB Bank era (2009\u20132016) ===\n\nAt the end of the 2008 season, Dynamo finished third, qualifying for the 2009\u201310 Champions League preliminary round. On 29 July 2009, Dynamo recorded a 0\u20131 away win against Celtic at Celtic Park, which gave them a strong advantage going into the second leg. However, Celtic comfortably defeated Dynamo 0\u20132 in Moscow to progress, sending Dynamo into the Europa League play-off round where the club was eliminated by Bulgarian side CSKA Sofia after a 0\u20130 away draw in Sofia and a 1\u20132 home defeat in Moscow.\nIn 2012, after a poor start to the season in which it lost its first five league games, Dynamo replaced interim manager Dmitri Khokhlov with the Romanian Dan Petrescu, who managed to pull the club out of the relegation zone into a position in the upper-half of the league table. The team was close to qualifying for a place in European competition, but a failure to win in the last matchday left them in seventh, two points below the last Europa League qualifier position. Despite his efforts, Petrescu's contract was terminated on 8 April 2014 by mutual agreement after a heavy loss to league outsiders Anzhi Makhachkala 0\u20134. As Dynamo Director of Sports Guram Adzhoyev stated, \"Last year Dan drew the team from the complicated situation, lifted it to the certain level, but recently we have seen no progress.\" Petrescu was replaced by Stanislav Cherchesov as manager. Under his management, Dynamo qualified for the group stage of the 2014\u201315 UEFA Europa League in which they won every game before falling to Napoli in the Round of 16. Dynamo was only able to finish in fourth place in the 2014\u201315 season after a string of poor results in the latter stages.\nIn June 2015, Dynamo was excluded from 2015\u201316 Europa League competition for violating Financial Fair Play break-even requirements. As a result, VTB Bank proposed to transfer 74 percent of the shares of the club to the Dynamo sports society. Under the proposed plan, the society would own 100 percent of shares of Dynamo as it did in 2009, while the shares of the VTB Arena would still be held by the Bank. The move would allow the club to comply with the requirements of Financial Fair Play, and VTB Bank would continue to provide support to Dynamo to the extent consistent with Financial Fair Play regulations.\nManager Stanislav Cherchesov was replaced by the returning Andrey Kobelev, and many foreign players, such as Mathieu Valbuena, Bal\u00e1zs Dzsudzs\u00e1k and Kevin Kur\u00e1nyi, subsequently left Dynamo. Several young Dynamo prospects, such as Grigori Morozov, Aleksandr Tashayev and Anatoli Katrich, who won the Under-21 competition in the 2014\u201315 season, were introduced to the first-team squad.\nOn 22 December 2015, Chairman of Dynamo's board of directors Vasili Titov announced that the shares had not been transferred to the Dynamo society; that FFP compliance rather than the share transfer was the top priority for the club; and that he expected the club to achieve compliance by April 2016.After the winter break of the 2015\u201316 season, Dynamo won only one game out of 12 played in 2016 and Kobelev was fired with 3 games left in the season. On the final day of the season, Dynamo lost 0-3 to FC Zenit St. Petersburg at home, dropped to 15th place in the table and was relegated from the Premier League for the first time in the club's history.\nIn October 2016, with Dynamo leading the second-tier Russian Football National League at the time, the newly appointed club president Yevgeni Muravyov claimed that club's debts stand at 13 billion rubles (approximately 188 million euros) and unless a new owner is found shortly or VTB re-commits to covering the club's debts, the club might declare bankruptcy. That would most likely mean the loss of professional license and relegation to the fourth-level Russian Amateur Football League.\n\n\n=== Dynamo Society era (2016 to 2019) ===\nOn 29 December 2016, Dynamo Sports Society agreed to buy VTB Bank shares back for 1 ruble. On 13 January 2017, VTB Bank announced they will sponsor Dynamo Sports Society to the amount of 10.64 billion rubles for the period from 2017 to 2019 (approximately 167 million euros as of that date). HC Dynamo Moscow and other teams of the society will also be financed under that deal. On 1 February 2017, former club president Boris Rotenberg said that the 75 million euro debt the football club owes to Rotenberg's companies has been restructured and \"is not harming anybody\". On 12 April 2017, with 7 games left to play in the 2016\u201317 season, Dynamo secured the return to the top level Russian Premier League for 2017\u201318. That is the FNL record for the earliest a team secured promotion.On 14 March 2018, Yevgeni Muravyov was dismissed as the club president due to unauthorized payment made as a \"bonus\" to a third company during the transfer of Konstantin Rausch from 1. FC K\u00f6ln.\n\n\n=== Return to VTB (from 2019) ===\nThe new stadium for the club, VTB Arena was completed in late 2018. Following that, the stadium majority owner and football club's major sponsor VTB Bank expressed interest in reacquiring the control over the club. On 14 February 2019, Dynamo Sports Society agreed to sell back the club shares to \"Dynamo Management Company\" (the company that owns the stadium and has VTB bank as the majority owner). The price was the same symbolic 1 ruble. On 26 April 2019, it was reported that the deal is close to be finalized formally, but the price for the stock increased to 10 billion rubles (approximately \u20ac138 million). This reported larger number includes accumulated debts and the cost of the club's training centre. On 30 April 2019, VTB confirmed that the deal has been closed and formal price is 1 ruble, the debts outstanding from the football club to Dynamo society has been restructured to an 8-year term, and Yuri Belkin will be appointed club's general director.\n\n\n== Rivalries ==\n\nSince its establishment in 1923, Dynamo's historical rival has been Spartak Moscow. Clashes between the clubs were seen by their fans and more generally as the most important games in the Soviet Union for more than three decades, attracting thousands of spectators. (Ironically, however, on New Year's Day in 1936, it was a combined Dynamo-Spartak team that traveled to Paris to face Racing Club de France, then one of Europe's top teams.) Dynamo clinched the first-ever Soviet League by beating Spartak 1\u20130 at Dynamo Stadium in front of 70,000 spectators. Spartak responded by winning the championship the following year. But after Dynamo's decline in the late 1970s, the rivalry has faded.  Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, first CSKA Moscow and then Zenit Saint Petersburg have emerged as the top clubs in Russian football, with the rivalries between Dynamo and its Moscow neighbours such as Spartak Moscow and Lokomotiv assuming less significance.\n\n\n== Stadium ==\n\nDynamo's ground used to be the historic Dynamo Stadium in Petrovsky Park, which seated 36,540. In 2008, it was closed for demolition. From 2010 to 2016, Dynamo Moscow played their matches at the Arena Khimki, which they shared with their Moscow rivals, CSKA Moscow. They continued to play at Arena Khimki until the 26th of May, 2019, when FC Dynamo Moscow officially \"returned home,\" \nas they played their first match at the newly opened VTB Arena.\n\n\n=== Average attendance ===\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== Domestic ===\nSoviet Top League / Russian Premier LeagueChampions (11): 1936 (spring), 1937, 1940, 1945, 1949, 1954, 1955, 1957 1959, 1963, 1976\nRunners-up (11): 1936 (autumn), 1946, 1947, 1948, 1950, 1956, 1958, 1962, 1967, 1970, 1986, 1994Soviet Cup / Russian CupWinners (7): 1937, 1953, 1967, 1970, 1977, 1984, 1994\u201395\nRunners-up (8): 1945, 1949, 1950, 1955, 1979, 1996\u201397, 1998\u201399, 2011\u201312Soviet Super Cup / Russian Super CupWinners: 1977\nRunners-up: 1984Russian Football National LeagueWinners: 2016\u201317\n\n\n=== European ===\nUEFA Cup Winners' CupRunners-up: 1971\u201372\n\n\n=== Non-official ===\nCiutat de Barcelona TrophyWinners: 1976Atlantic CupWinners: 2015Lev Yashin CupWinners: 2010\n\n\n== League and cup history ==\n\n\n== European campaigns ==\n\n\n=== UEFA ranking ===\nAs of 30 May 2019\n\n\n== Players ==\n\n\n=== Current squad ===\nAs of 21 February 2020, according to the RFPL official website\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

        "wiki": "Khabarovsk (Russian: \u0425\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0301\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a, tr. Khabarovsk, IPA: [x\u0250\u02c8bar\u0259fsk] (listen)) is the largest city and the administrative center of Khabarovsk Krai, Russia, located 30 kilometers (19 mi) from the Chinese border, at the confluence of the Amur and Ussuri Rivers, about 800 kilometers (500 mi) north of Vladivostok. The city was the administrative center of the Far Eastern Federal District of Russia from 2002 until December 2018, when Vladivostok took over that role. It is the largest city in the Russian Far East, having overtaken Vladivostok in 2015. As of the 2010 Census, its population was 577,441. It was previously known as Khabarovka (until 1893).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Earliest Record ===\nHistorical records indicate that Khabarovsk was founded in the eighth century. The Tungusic peoples are indigenous to the city's vicinity. The city was named \"Boli\" under Chinese occupation. During the Tang Dynasty, Boli was the capital of Heishui, called Heishuiduhufu.\n In A.D. 722, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (\u5510\u7384\u5b97) established Heishui Protectorate and gave self-rule to Heishui Mohe tribes. Then, the capital city of this administrative region in the area of Habarovsk had been constructed.\n\n\n=== 17th-century Russian explorers ===\nIn the mid-17th century, the Amur Valley became the scene of hostilities between the Russian Cossacks, who tried to expand into the region and collect tribute from the natives, and the rising Manchu Qing Dynasty, who were intent on securing the region for themselves.\n\n\n==== Khabarov's Achansk ====\n\nThe Russian explorers and raiders of the 1650s set up a number of more or less fortified camps (ostrogs) on the Amur. Most of them were in use for only a few months, and later destroyed. It is usually thought that the first such camp in the general area of today's Khabarovsk was the fortified winter camp named Achansk (\u0410\u0447\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a) or Achansky gorodok (\u0410\u0447\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043a), built by the Cossacks of Yerofey Khabarov in September 1651 after they had sailed to the area from the upper Amur. The fort was named after the local tribe whom Khabarov's people called \"Achans\". Already on October 8 the fort was unsuccessfully attacked by joint forces of Achans and Duchers (who had good reasons to hate the Cossacks, due to their rather heavy-handed tribute-extraction tactics), while many Russians were away fishing. In late November, Khabarov's people undertook a three-day campaign against the local chief Zhakshur (\u0416\u0430\u043a\u0448\u0443\u0440) (whose name is also known in a more Russian version, Zaksor (\u0417\u0430\u043a\u0441\u043e\u0440)), collecting a large amount of tribute and announcing that the locals were now subjects of the Russian Czar. Similar campaign was waged later in winter against the Ducher chief Nechiga (\u041d\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0433\u0430), farther away from Achansk.On March 24 (or 26), 1652, Fort Achansk was attacked by Manchu cavalry, led by Ninguta's commander Haise, reinforced by Ducher auxiliaries, but the Cossacks stood their ground in a day-long battle and even managed to seize the attackers' supply train. Once the ice on the Amur broke in the spring of 1652, Khabarov's people destroyed their fort and sailed away.The exact location of Khabarov's Achansk has long been a subject for the debate among Russian historians and geographers. A number of locations, both upstream and downstream of today's Khabarovsk, have been proposed since Richard Maack, one of the first Russian scholars to visit the region, identified Achansk in 1859 with the ruins on Cape Kyrma, which is located on the southern (Chinese) shore of the Amur, upstream of Khabarovsk. The most widely accepted point of view is probably that of Boris Polevoy, who believed that Khabarov's Achansk was located in the Nanai village later known as Odzhal-Bolon (Russian: \u041e\u0434\u0436\u0430\u043b-\u0411\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043d\u044c), located on the left bank of the Amur, closer to Amursk than to Khabarovsk. One of his arguments was that both Khabarov's Achan (sometimes also spelled by the explorer as Otshchan, \u041e\u0442\u0449\u0430\u043d), and Wuzhala (\u4e4c\u624e\u62c9) of the Chinese records of the 1652 engagement are based on the name of the Nanai clan \"Odzhal\" (\u041e\u0434\u0436\u0430\u043b), corresponding to the 20th-century name of the village as well. (The name of the clan was also written as \"Uzala\", as in the name of its best-known member, Dersu Uzala).Polevoy's view appeared to gain wide support among the Russian geographer community; petitioned by the Amur Branch of the Russian Geographical Society, the Russian Government renamed the village of Odzhal to Achan in 1977, to celebrate its connection with Khabarov's raid.As to the Cape Kyrma ruins, thought by Maack to be the remains of Achansk, B.P. Polevoy identified them as the remains of another ostrog - namely, Kosogorsky Ostrog, where Onufriy Stepanov stayed a few years later.\n\n\n=== Qing Empire ===\nAfter the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689), the area became an uncontested part of the Qing Empire for the next century and a half. Modern historical maps of the Qing period published in China mark the site of future Khabarovsk as B\u00f3l\u00ec (Chinese: \u4f2f\u529b). All of the middle and lower Amur region was nominally part of the Jilin Province, run first out of Ninguta and later out of Jilin City.\nFrench Jesuits who sailed along the Ussury and the Amur in 1709 prepared the first more or less precise map of the region. According to them, the indigenous Nanai people were living on the Ussury and on the Amur down to the mouth of the Dondon River (i.e., in the region including the site of the future Khabarovsk). These people were known to the Chinese as Yupi Dazi (\"Fish skin Tartars\").\n\n\n=== From Khabarovka to Khabarovsk ===\n\nIn 1858, the area was ceded to Russia under the Treaty of Aigun. The Russians founded the military outpost of Khabarovka (\u0425\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0301\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430), named after Yerofey Khabarov. The post later became an important industrial center for the region. Town status was granted in 1880; in 1893, it was given its present name.In 1894, a department of Russian Geographical Society was formed in Khabarovsk and to found libraries, theatres and museums in the city. Since then, Khabarovsk's cultural life has flourished. Much of the local indigenous history has been well preserved in the Regional Lore Museum and Natural History Museum and in places like near the Nanai settlement of Sikachi-Alyan, where cliff drawings from more than 13,000 years ago can be found. The Khabarovsk Art Museum exhibits a rare collection of old Russian icons.\nIn 1916, the Khabarovsk Bridge across the Amur was completed, allowing Trans-Siberian trains to cross the river without using ferries (or temporary rail tracks over the frozen river in winter).\n\n\n=== Soviet era ===\n\nAfter the defeat of Japan in World War II,  Khabarovsk was the site of the Khabarovsk War Crime Trials, in which twelve former members of the Japanese Kwantung Army and Unit 731 were put on trial for the manufacture and use of biological weapons during World War II.\nChinese Emperor Puyi, captured by Soviet troops in Manchuria, was relocated to Khabarovsk and lived there from 1945 up to 1950, when he was returned to China.When Japan fell in September 1945 the United States reached an agreement with Stalin to build two U.S. Naval Advance Bases (Fleet Weather Centrals) in the USSR. The U.S built one 10 miles (16 km) outside Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky on the Kamchatka Peninsula with the code name TAMA.  The other was 20 miles (32 km) outside Khabarovsk in buildings provided by the Soviets, code-named MOKO.  For mail Khabarovsk was assigned  U.S.Navy number 1168,  FPO San Francisco.  The American use of these two bases was short-lived.\nOn 5 November 1956, the first phase of the city tram was commissioned. The Khabarovsk television studio began broadcasting in 1960. On 1 September 1967, the Khabarovsk Institute of Physical Education, now the Far Eastern State Academy of Physical Culture, opened. On 14 January 1971 Khabarovsk was awarded the Order of October Revolution. In 1975 the first stage of the urban trolley opened. In 1976 the city hosted an international ice hockey tournament with the ball for the prize of the newspaper Sovietskaya Rossia. In 1981 the Bandy World Championship was played in the city.\n\n\n=== Russian Federation ===\nIn 1996, Khabarovsk held its first mayoral elections. Paul D. Filippov, whose candidacy was supported by Governor Viktor Ishayev, was defeated. In 1998, reconstruction of the central square of Khabarovsk was completed. In May 2000, President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, decreed that new federal districts be formed, and Khabarovsk became the center of the Far Eastern Federal District.\nIn 2006, the Center for Cardiovascular Surgery, a high-tech medical center, was constructed according to a Russian national health project. In 2008, the train station was completely renovated, and the adjacent square was reconstructed to include fountains and an underground passage. In 2009, Khabarovsk hosted the EU-Russia summit. In 2010, the city hosted a meeting of the Great Circle of Ussuri Cossacks. On 3 November 2012, Khabarovsk was awarded the honorary title of \"City of Military Glory\".\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status ==\nKhabarovsk is the administrative center of the krai and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Khabarovsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the city of krai significance of Khabarovsk\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of krai significance of Khabarovsk is incorporated as Khabarovsk Urban Okrug.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nKhabarovsk experiences a monsoonal dry-winter humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dwb borders on Dwa).\nThe average annual precipitation is 682 millimeters (26.9 in), mainly concentrated in the summer. In a few years, November to March hardly receive any precipitation. The driest year was 2001 with only 381 millimeters (15.0 in) of precipitation and the wettest was 1981 when 1,105 millimeters (43.5 in) of precipitation fell. The wettest month was August 1981 with a total precipitation of 434 millimeters (17.1 in). Snowfall is common, though light, with an average maximum snow height of 16 centimeters (6.3 in).\nThe city's extreme climate sees daily average high and low temperatures vary by around 50 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) over the course of the year. The average temperature in January is \u221219.8 \u00b0C (\u22123.6 \u00b0F) and the average for July is +21.3 \u00b0C (70.3 \u00b0F). Extremes have ranged from \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) in January 2011 to +36.4 \u00b0C (97.5 \u00b0F) in June 2010.\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\n\nPrimary industries include iron processing, steel milling, Khabarovsk shipyard, Daldizel, machinery, petroleum refining, flour milling, pharmaceutical industry, meat packing and manufacturing of various types of heavy and light machinery.\nA high-speed international fiber-optic cable connects the city of Khabarovsk with the city of Fuyuan in China.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nThe city is principal railway center and is located along the Trans-Siberian Railway; the rail distance of Khabarovsk railway station from Moscow is 8,523 kilometers (5,296 mi).\nKhabarovsk is served by the Khabarovsk Novy Airport with international flights to East Asia, Southeast Asia, European Russia, and Central Asia.\nRoad links include the Trans-Siberian Highway (M58 and M60 Highways), and water transport links are provided by the Amur River and Ussuri River.\nPublic transport includes: tram (8 routes); trolleybus (4 routes); bus and fixed-route taxi (marshrutka, approximately 100 routes).\n\n\n== Education ==\nThere are the following institutions of higher education in Khabarovsk:\nPacific National University (former Khabarovsk State University of Technology)\nFar Eastern State University of Humanities (former Khabarovsk State Teachers Training University)\nFar Eastern State Medical University\nKhabarovsk State Academy of Economics and Law\nFar Eastern State Transport University\nFar Eastern Academy of Public Service\nFar Eastern State Physical Education University\nKhabarovsk State Institute of Arts and Culture\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nA key street in Khabarovsk is the broad Amursky Boulevard with its many shops and a local market. The city's five districts stretch for 45 kilometers (28 mi) along the Amur River. The similar boulevard - Ussuryisky is located between the two main streets Muravyov-Amursky and Lenin street and runs to the city's artificial lakes (Gorodskie Prudi) with the sport complex Platinum Arena. The lakes are famous for their fountains with the light show. The Military History Museum of the Far Eastern Military District is located in the city, the only such museum in the Russian Far East.Recently, there have been renovations in the city's central part, rebuilding with historical perspective. There is a walking tour from the Lenin Square to Utyos on Amur via Muravyov-Amursky Street, where visitors find traditional Russian cuisine restaurants and shops with souvenirs. There are a number of night clubs and pubs in this area.\nIn Wintertime ice sculptures are on display on the cities squares and parks. Artists come from as far as Harbin in China.\nUnlike Vladivostok, the city has never been closed to foreigners, despite it being the headquarters of the Far East Military District, and retains its historically international flavor. Once the capital of the Soviet Far East (from 1926 to 1938), since the demise of the Soviet Union, it has experienced an increased Asian presence. It is estimated that over one million Chinese travel to and through Khabarovsk yearly, and foreign investment by Japanese and Korean corporations has grown in recent years. The city has a multi-story shopping mall and about a dozen hotels.\nAleksandr Fedosov, the Khabarovsk Krai Minister of Culture, estimates that the city became more attractive to tourists following the 2015 Bandy World Championship.Khabarovsk is the closest major city to Birobidzhan, which is the administrative center of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, Russia, located on the Trans-Siberian Railway, close to the border with China. The Jewish Autonomous Oblast is a federal subject of Russia in the Russian Far East, bordering Khabarovsk Krai and Amur Oblast in Russia and Heilongjiang province in China. Its administrative center is the town of Birobidzhan, and it is the only region in the world in that Yiddish is the official language. Khabarovsk provides the closest major airport to Birobidzhan, which is Khabarovsk Novy Airport (KHV / UHHH), 198 km from the center of Birobidzhan.\n\n\n== Military ==\n\nThe headquarters of the Russian Ground Forces's Eastern Military District is located at 15 Serysheva Street. The district was preceded by the Far Eastern Military District, which was located in the same location. The following component units of the district are stationed in the city:\n\n104th Cluj Headquarters Brigade\nHonour Guard Company of the Khabarovsk Garrison\n17th Independent Electronic Warfare Brigade\n118th Independent Pontoon-Bridge Railway Battalion\n392nd Pacific Training Center for Junior Specialists\n11th Air and Air Defence Forces Army\nMilitary Band of the Eastern Military DistrictAll 5 of these units make up the Khabarovsk Garrison. The Russian Navy's Pacific Fleet maintains a presence in the city as well. There is also an air base located 3 km (1.9 mi) to the east of the city. The main public relations asset for the military in the city is the Military History Museum of the Far Eastern Military District and the district military band.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nAmur Khabarovsk, a professional ice hockey club of the international Kontinental Hockey League and plays its home games at the Platinum Arena. It used to be the easternmost-based team in the league until Admiral Vladivostok joined the KHL in 2013 as an expansion team.\nFC SKA-Khabarovsk, a professional association football team playing in the Russian Premier League, the top tier of Russian association football.\nSKA-Neftyanik, a professional bandy club which plays in the top-tier Russian Bandy Super League at its own indoor venue Arena Yerofey. It is both the easternmost and southernmost team in the top division. In the 2016-17 season the club became Russian champion for the first time. As of 2019 the team has won the title three years in a row.\n\n\n=== International events ===\nThe city was a host to the 1981 Bandy World Championship.  It also hosted the 2015 Bandy World Championship, which was visited by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. 21 teams were expected, which would have been 4 more than the then record-making 17 (now it's 18) from the 2014 tournament. In the end, China was the only newcomer, while Canada and Ukraine withdrew, the latter for political reasons. Khabarovsk organised the 2018 tournament as well, but not Division B that time around, which was held in Chinese Harbin. The event was named by the Federal Agency for Tourism as one of the best 200 events of the year.\n\n\n==== Important visits ====\nA delegation from the 2022 Winter Olympics organising committee will visit Khabarovsk to watch matches in the bandy league, since they are considering letting bandy be a part of the programme in 2022.\n\n\n== People ==\nOleksandr Aliyev, association football player\nSergei Bodrov, filmmaker\nEvgeny Grachev, ice hockey player\nMikhail Grigorenko, ice hockey player\nAlexandra Ivanovskaya, 2005 Miss Russia winner\nAlexander Mogilny, ice hockey player\nEvgeni Plushenko, Olympic figure skater\nIvan Skobrev, speed skater\nAndrei Tchmil, professional cyclist\nEfim Zelmanov, mathematician\nIvan Koumaev, dancer\nAndrey Zamkovoy, boxer\nVita Sidorkina, model\nVladimir Volegov, painter\nDenis Kenzo, music producer\nDaria Usacheva, figure skater\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\n\nKhabarovsk is twinned with:\n\n\n== Awards ==\nKhabarovsk placed first in different categories of \"Most Developed and Comfortable City of Russia\" in 2006, 2008 and 2009.\nIn 2010, Khabarovsk won the second place in the Forbes list of most suitable cities for private business in Russia.

        "wiki": "Khabarovsk (Russian: \u0425\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0301\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a, tr. Khabarovsk, IPA: [x\u0250\u02c8bar\u0259fsk] (listen)) is the largest city and the administrative center of Khabarovsk Krai, Russia, located 30 kilometers (19 mi) from the Chinese border, at the confluence of the Amur and Ussuri Rivers, about 800 kilometers (500 mi) north of Vladivostok. The city was the administrative center of the Far Eastern Federal District of Russia from 2002 until December 2018, when Vladivostok took over that role. It is the largest city in the Russian Far East, having overtaken Vladivostok in 2015. As of the 2010 Census, its population was 577,441. It was previously known as Khabarovka (until 1893).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Earliest Record ===\nHistorical records indicate that Khabarovsk was founded in the eighth century. The Tungusic peoples are indigenous to the city's vicinity. The city was named \"Boli\" under Chinese occupation. During the Tang Dynasty, Boli was the capital of Heishui, called Heishuiduhufu.\n In A.D. 722, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (\u5510\u7384\u5b97) established Heishui Protectorate and gave self-rule to Heishui Mohe tribes. Then, the capital city of this administrative region in the area of Habarovsk had been constructed.\n\n\n=== 17th-century Russian explorers ===\nIn the mid-17th century, the Amur Valley became the scene of hostilities between the Russian Cossacks, who tried to expand into the region and collect tribute from the natives, and the rising Manchu Qing Dynasty, who were intent on securing the region for themselves.\n\n\n==== Khabarov's Achansk ====\n\nThe Russian explorers and raiders of the 1650s set up a number of more or less fortified camps (ostrogs) on the Amur. Most of them were in use for only a few months, and later destroyed. It is usually thought that the first such camp in the general area of today's Khabarovsk was the fortified winter camp named Achansk (\u0410\u0447\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a) or Achansky gorodok (\u0410\u0447\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043a), built by the Cossacks of Yerofey Khabarov in September 1651 after they had sailed to the area from the upper Amur. The fort was named after the local tribe whom Khabarov's people called \"Achans\". Already on October 8 the fort was unsuccessfully attacked by joint forces of Achans and Duchers (who had good reasons to hate the Cossacks, due to their rather heavy-handed tribute-extraction tactics), while many Russians were away fishing. In late November, Khabarov's people undertook a three-day campaign against the local chief Zhakshur (\u0416\u0430\u043a\u0448\u0443\u0440) (whose name is also known in a more Russian version, Zaksor (\u0417\u0430\u043a\u0441\u043e\u0440)), collecting a large amount of tribute and announcing that the locals were now subjects of the Russian Czar. Similar campaign was waged later in winter against the Ducher chief Nechiga (\u041d\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0433\u0430), farther away from Achansk.On March 24 (or 26), 1652, Fort Achansk was attacked by Manchu cavalry, led by Ninguta's commander Haise, reinforced by Ducher auxiliaries, but the Cossacks stood their ground in a day-long battle and even managed to seize the attackers' supply train. Once the ice on the Amur broke in the spring of 1652, Khabarov's people destroyed their fort and sailed away.The exact location of Khabarov's Achansk has long been a subject for the debate among Russian historians and geographers. A number of locations, both upstream and downstream of today's Khabarovsk, have been proposed since Richard Maack, one of the first Russian scholars to visit the region, identified Achansk in 1859 with the ruins on Cape Kyrma, which is located on the southern (Chinese) shore of the Amur, upstream of Khabarovsk. The most widely accepted point of view is probably that of Boris Polevoy, who believed that Khabarov's Achansk was located in the Nanai village later known as Odzhal-Bolon (Russian: \u041e\u0434\u0436\u0430\u043b-\u0411\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043d\u044c), located on the left bank of the Amur, closer to Amursk than to Khabarovsk. One of his arguments was that both Khabarov's Achan (sometimes also spelled by the explorer as Otshchan, \u041e\u0442\u0449\u0430\u043d), and Wuzhala (\u4e4c\u624e\u62c9) of the Chinese records of the 1652 engagement are based on the name of the Nanai clan \"Odzhal\" (\u041e\u0434\u0436\u0430\u043b), corresponding to the 20th-century name of the village as well. (The name of the clan was also written as \"Uzala\", as in the name of its best-known member, Dersu Uzala).Polevoy's view appeared to gain wide support among the Russian geographer community; petitioned by the Amur Branch of the Russian Geographical Society, the Russian Government renamed the village of Odzhal to Achan in 1977, to celebrate its connection with Khabarov's raid.As to the Cape Kyrma ruins, thought by Maack to be the remains of Achansk, B.P. Polevoy identified them as the remains of another ostrog - namely, Kosogorsky Ostrog, where Onufriy Stepanov stayed a few years later.\n\n\n=== Qing Empire ===\nAfter the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689), the area became an uncontested part of the Qing Empire for the next century and a half. Modern historical maps of the Qing period published in China mark the site of future Khabarovsk as B\u00f3l\u00ec (Chinese: \u4f2f\u529b). All of the middle and lower Amur region was nominally part of the Jilin Province, run first out of Ninguta and later out of Jilin City.\nFrench Jesuits who sailed along the Ussury and the Amur in 1709 prepared the first more or less precise map of the region. According to them, the indigenous Nanai people were living on the Ussury and on the Amur down to the mouth of the Dondon River (i.e., in the region including the site of the future Khabarovsk). These people were known to the Chinese as Yupi Dazi (\"Fish skin Tartars\").\n\n\n=== From Khabarovka to Khabarovsk ===\n\nIn 1858, the area was ceded to Russia under the Treaty of Aigun. The Russians founded the military outpost of Khabarovka (\u0425\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0301\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430), named after Yerofey Khabarov. The post later became an important industrial center for the region. Town status was granted in 1880; in 1893, it was given its present name.In 1894, a department of Russian Geographical Society was formed in Khabarovsk and to found libraries, theatres and museums in the city. Since then, Khabarovsk's cultural life has flourished. Much of the local indigenous history has been well preserved in the Regional Lore Museum and Natural History Museum and in places like near the Nanai settlement of Sikachi-Alyan, where cliff drawings from more than 13,000 years ago can be found. The Khabarovsk Art Museum exhibits a rare collection of old Russian icons.\nIn 1916, the Khabarovsk Bridge across the Amur was completed, allowing Trans-Siberian trains to cross the river without using ferries (or temporary rail tracks over the frozen river in winter).\n\n\n=== Soviet era ===\n\nAfter the defeat of Japan in World War II,  Khabarovsk was the site of the Khabarovsk War Crime Trials, in which twelve former members of the Japanese Kwantung Army and Unit 731 were put on trial for the manufacture and use of biological weapons during World War II.\nChinese Emperor Puyi, captured by Soviet troops in Manchuria, was relocated to Khabarovsk and lived there from 1945 up to 1950, when he was returned to China.When Japan fell in September 1945 the United States reached an agreement with Stalin to build two U.S. Naval Advance Bases (Fleet Weather Centrals) in the USSR. The U.S built one 10 miles (16 km) outside Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky on the Kamchatka Peninsula with the code name TAMA.  The other was 20 miles (32 km) outside Khabarovsk in buildings provided by the Soviets, code-named MOKO.  For mail Khabarovsk was assigned  U.S.Navy number 1168,  FPO San Francisco.  The American use of these two bases was short-lived.\nOn 5 November 1956, the first phase of the city tram was commissioned. The Khabarovsk television studio began broadcasting in 1960. On 1 September 1967, the Khabarovsk Institute of Physical Education, now the Far Eastern State Academy of Physical Culture, opened. On 14 January 1971 Khabarovsk was awarded the Order of October Revolution. In 1975 the first stage of the urban trolley opened. In 1976 the city hosted an international ice hockey tournament with the ball for the prize of the newspaper Sovietskaya Rossia. In 1981 the Bandy World Championship was played in the city.\n\n\n=== Russian Federation ===\nIn 1996, Khabarovsk held its first mayoral elections. Paul D. Filippov, whose candidacy was supported by Governor Viktor Ishayev, was defeated. In 1998, reconstruction of the central square of Khabarovsk was completed. In May 2000, President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, decreed that new federal districts be formed, and Khabarovsk became the center of the Far Eastern Federal District.\nIn 2006, the Center for Cardiovascular Surgery, a high-tech medical center, was constructed according to a Russian national health project. In 2008, the train station was completely renovated, and the adjacent square was reconstructed to include fountains and an underground passage. In 2009, Khabarovsk hosted the EU-Russia summit. In 2010, the city hosted a meeting of the Great Circle of Ussuri Cossacks. On 3 November 2012, Khabarovsk was awarded the honorary title of \"City of Military Glory\".\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status ==\nKhabarovsk is the administrative center of the krai and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Khabarovsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the city of krai significance of Khabarovsk\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of krai significance of Khabarovsk is incorporated as Khabarovsk Urban Okrug.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nKhabarovsk experiences a monsoonal dry-winter humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dwb borders on Dwa).\nThe average annual precipitation is 682 millimeters (26.9 in), mainly concentrated in the summer.

Artists come from as far as Harbin in China.\nUnlike Vladivostok, the city has never been closed to foreigners, despite it being the headquarters of the Far East Military District, and retains its historically international flavor. Once the capital of the Soviet Far East (from 1926 to 1938), since the demise of the Soviet Union, it has experienced an increased Asian presence. It is estimated that over one million Chinese travel to and through Khabarovsk yearly, and foreign investment by Japanese and Korean corporations has grown in recent years. The city has a multi-story shopping mall and about a dozen hotels.\nAleksandr Fedosov, the Khabarovsk Krai Minister of Culture, estimates that the city became more attractive to tourists following the 2015 Bandy World Championship.Khabarovsk is the closest major city to Birobidzhan, which is the administrative center of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, Russia, located on the Trans-Siberian Railway, close to the border with China. The Jewish Autonomous Oblast is a federal subject of Russia in the Russian Far East, bordering Khabarovsk Krai and Amur Oblast in Russia and Heilongjiang province in China. Its administrative center is the town of Birobidzhan, and it is the only region in the world in that Yiddish is the official language. Khabarovsk provides the closest major airport to Birobidzhan, which is Khabarovsk Novy Airport (KHV / UHHH), 198 km from the center of Birobidzhan.\n\n\n== Military ==\n\nThe headquarters of the Russian Ground Forces's Eastern Military District is located at 15 Serysheva Street. The district was preceded by the Far Eastern Military District, which was located in the same location. The following component units of the district are stationed in the city:\n\n104th Cluj Headquarters Brigade\nHonour Guard Company of the Khabarovsk Garrison\n17th Independent Electronic Warfare Brigade\n118th Independent Pontoon-Bridge Railway Battalion\n392nd Pacific Training Center for Junior Specialists\n11th Air and Air Defence Forces Army\nMilitary Band of the Eastern Military DistrictAll 5 of these units make up the Khabarovsk Garrison. The Russian Navy's Pacific Fleet maintains a presence in the city as well. There is also an air base located 3 km (1.9 mi) to the east of the city. The main public relations asset for the military in the city is the Military History Museum of the Far Eastern Military District and the district military band.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nAmur Khabarovsk, a professional ice hockey club of the international Kontinental Hockey League and plays its home games at the Platinum Arena. It used to be the easternmost-based team in the league until Admiral Vladivostok joined the KHL in 2013 as an expansion team.\nFC SKA-Khabarovsk, a professional association football team playing in the Russian Premier League, the top tier of Russian association football.\nSKA-Neftyanik, a professional bandy club which plays in the top-tier Russian Bandy Super League at its own indoor venue Arena Yerofey. It is both the easternmost and southernmost team in the top division. In the 2016-17 season the club became Russian champion for the first time. As of 2019 the team has won the title three years in a row.\n\n\n=== International events ===\nThe city was a host to the 1981 Bandy World Championship.  It also hosted the 2015 Bandy World Championship, which was visited by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. 21 teams were expected, which would have been 4 more than the then record-making 17 (now it's 18) from the 2014 tournament. In the end, China was the only newcomer, while Canada and Ukraine withdrew, the latter for political reasons. Khabarovsk organised the 2018 tournament as well, but not Division B that time around, which was held in Chinese Harbin. The event was named by the Federal Agency for Tourism as one of the best 200 events of the year.\n\n\n==== Important visits ====\nA delegation from the 2022 Winter Olympics organising committee will visit Khabarovsk to watch matches in the bandy league, since they are considering letting bandy be a part of the programme in 2022.\n\n\n== People ==\nOleksandr Aliyev, association football player\nSergei Bodrov, filmmaker\nEvgeny Grachev, ice hockey player\nMikhail Grigorenko, ice hockey player\nAlexandra Ivanovskaya, 2005 Miss Russia winner\nAlexander Mogilny, ice hockey player\nEvgeni Plushenko, Olympic figure skater\nIvan Skobrev, speed skater\nAndrei Tchmil, professional cyclist\nEfim Zelmanov, mathematician\nIvan Koumaev, dancer\nAndrey Zamkovoy, boxer\nVita Sidorkina, model\nVladimir Volegov, painter\nDenis Kenzo, music producer\nDaria Usacheva, figure skater\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\n\nKhabarovsk is twinned with:\n\n\n== Awards ==\nKhabarovsk placed first in different categories of \"Most Developed and Comfortable City of Russia\" in 2006, 2008 and 2009.\nIn 2010, Khabarovsk won the second place in the Forbes list of most suitable cities for private business in Russia.

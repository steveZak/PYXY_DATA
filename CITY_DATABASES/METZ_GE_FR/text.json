        "wiki": "The Centre Pompidou-Metz is a museum of modern and contemporary art located in Metz, capital of Lorraine, France. It is a branch of Pompidou arts centre of Paris, and features semi-permanent and temporary exhibitions from the large collection of the French National Museum of Modern Art, the largest European collection of 20th and 21st century arts. The museum is the largest temporary exhibition space outside Paris in France with 5,000 m2 (54,000 sq ft) divided between 3 galleries, a theatre, and an auditorium.\nThe first piece of the monument designed by Japanese architect Shigeru Ban was laid on November 7, 2006, and the building was inaugurated by French President Nicolas Sarkozy on May 12, 2010. The building is remarkable for its roof structure, one of the largest and most complex built to date, which was inspired by a Chinese hat found in Paris by Shigeru Ban.Since its inauguration, the institution has become one of the most visited cultural venues in France outside Paris.\n\n\n== Architecture and urban design ==\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz is a large hexagon structured round a central spire reaching 77 m (253 ft), alluding to the 1977 opening date of the original Centre Pompidou of Paris. It possesses three rectangular galleries (Gallery 1, 2, and 3) weaving through the building at different levels, jutting out through the roof with huge picture windows angled towards landmarks such as the Saint-Stephen Gothic cathedral, the Imperial railway station, the Arsenal Concert Hall built by Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill, the Ar\u00e8nes indoor sport arena built by French architect Paul Chemetov, and the Seille park. The great nave covers 1,200 m2 (13,000 sq ft) and provides flexibility for the exhibition of large artworks, with the ceiling rising progressively from a height of 5.7 m (19 ft) to 18 m (59 ft).\n\nThe roof is the major achievement of the building: a 90 m (300 ft) wide hexagon echoing the building's floor map. With a surface area of 8,000 m2 (86,000 sq ft), the roof structure is composed of sixteen kilometres of glued laminated timber, that intersect to form hexagonal wooden units resembling the cane-work pattern of a Chinese hat. The roof's geometry is irregular, featuring curves and counter-curves over the entire building, and in particular the three exhibition galleries. Imitating this kind of hat and its protective fabric, the entire wooden structure is covered with a white fibreglass membrane and a coating of teflon, which has the distinction of being self-cleaning, protecting from direct sunlight, while providing a transparent view at night. The roof structure can be seen from high up during both day and night in Metz from above, an aerial movie made by French photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand.The Centre Pompidou-Metz includes also a restaurant terrace, for which French designer Patrick Jouin and Kenyan architect Sanjit Manku produced interior spaces inspired by the image of a kaleidoscope.  The museum-surrounding garden has been thought by French landscape architect Jean de Gastine using the concepts of sustainable gardening.\nThe museum is the cornerstone of the newly created Amphitheater District of Metz. The district of 50 ha (123.6 acres), thought by French architects Nicolas Michelin, Jean-Paul Viguier, and Christian de Portzamparc, and designer Philippe Starck, is currently under construction and includes the edification of a convention centre and a shopping mall. The quarter encompasses already the Seille park designed by French landscape architect Jacques Coulon and the Ar\u00e8nes indoor sport arena built in 2002. The urban project completion is expected to take place by 2016.  Swiss designer Ruedi Baur created the Metz's signage systems.\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz and its forecourt, named Human Rights square, are built on the site of the Roman amphitheatre of Divodurum Medriomaticum (ancestor of present-day Metz), near the Metz Imperial District and the Station Palace.\n\n\n== Exhibitions and performances ==\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz also displays around 3 to 4 unique temporary exhibitions per year, which are not presented elsewhere. Most of the artworks exhibited are from the large collection of the National Museum of Modern Art, which encompasses the largest European collection of modern and contemporary arts and the second in the world. The museum works in close collaboration with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Luxembourgian Museum of Modern Art, or the Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe in joint initiatives.\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz promotes the local art scene in collaborating with the Regional Contemporary Art Fund of Lorraine. In addition to the temporary exhibitions, the Centre Pompidou-Metz museum features seasonal programming with contemporary live shows in its theater and organizes meetings and conferences in its auditorium with worldly recognized, as well as, local artists.\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz edifice and surrounding Metz are sometimes used as support for the artistic production displayed during the temporary exhibitions. For example, the architectural structure of the Centre Pompidou-Metz was used as support for a visual art project by French visual artists Simon Geilfus, Yannick Jacquet, and Thomas Vaqui\u00e9. Also, French aerial photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand captured Metz from high up, giving a privileged views of the museum and the city for the exhibition Views from above.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n\n\n== Transport and access ==\n\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz is located in the centre of Metz and is served by Mettis local public transport. Also, the museum is located near the Imperial railway station of Metz, which is connected to the French high speed train network via the LGV East line, which provides a direct rail service to Paris and the city of Luxembourg. The time from Paris East station and France international Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport to Metz railway station is about 82 and 75 minutes, respectively. Finally, Metz is located at the intersection of two major road axes: the Paris to Strasbourg A4 motorway and the A31 north-south motorway.\n\n\n== Beacons exhibition ==\nBased entirely on loans from the collection at French National Museum of Modern Art, the Beacons exhibition is semi-permanent exhibition that highlights since 2014 a selection of 18 masterpieces rarely shown to the public due to their monumental size. The exhibition's staging provides an overview of the primary movements in art since the start of the 20th century, from Pablo Picasso to Anish Kapoor including Sam Francis, Joseph Beuys, Dan Flavin, and Joan Mir\u00f3. Art works exhibited include:\n\nFigures and Birds in the Night, Joan Mir\u00f3\nSurvivors, Yan Pei-Ming\nHomogenous Infiltration for Piano, Joseph Beuys\nReflexions of a Waterfall I, Louise Nevelson\nTabula, Simon Hanta\u00ef\nEntrance to the Railway Pavilion, Robert Delaunay\nStage curtain for the ballet Mercure, Pablo Picasso\nComposition with Two Parrots, Fernand L\u00e9ger\nOrangey, Light Blue Forms, Claude Viallat\nPalombe, Frank Stella\nPainting 202 x 453 cm, 29 June 1979, Pierre Soulages\nAware II, 28.3.1961, Jean Degottex\nLost World, Pierre Alechinsky\nIn Lovely Blueness, Sam Francis\nFor a Little While, Joan Mitchell\nUntitled, Anish Kapoor\nUntitled (to Donna) 5a, Dan Flavin\nUntitled, Robert Irwin\n\n\n== Inaugural exhibition ==\nThe inaugural exhibition called Masterpieces? was devoted to masterpieces (about 800), of which over 700 were lent by the Centre Georges Pompidou of Paris. The exhibition considered the relevance of the idea of masterpiece and ran until January 17, 2011. The exhibition has attracted over 800,000 visitors during the following year of its inauguration and included:\n\nWoman with a Guitar, Georges Braque\nKing's Sadness, Henri Matisse\nThe Aubade, Lying Nude near Musician, Pablo Picasso\nGuernica, Pablo Picasso\nIngres's Violin, photographie, Man Ray\nBlack cross, Kasimir Malevitch\nBlue I, Blue II, Blue III triptych, Joan Mir\u00f3\nReliefs for the Stairs of the Railway Palace, Robert Delaunay\nCapricorn, Max Ernst\nThe Background, Jackson Pollock\nStanding Woman, Alberto Giacometti\nSleeping Muse, Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i\nThe Tropical House, Jean Prouv\u00e9The four parts of the exhibition were:\n\nGreat nave: Masterpieces throughout history\nGallery 1: Stories behind masterpieces\nGallery 2: Masterpiece dreams\nGallery 3: Masterpieces ad infinitum\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCentre Pompidou - Metz website\nArchitect Shiregu Ban's website\nMetz municipal council website\nMetz-Metropole website\nWebsite of tourism office of Metz \nWebsite of tourism office of Lorraine",

          "Great to see the building. As you\u2019d expect in a contemporary art gallery some of the exhibitions were truly awful and others very exciting. Loved the exhibition of Opera design. Very rare to see this.",
          "Beautiful building. Modern art . The exhibition on the ground Floor was not very interesting but on the second and third Floor was original and very nice especially the Work of Rebecca Horn",
          "Superb creativity in the architecture! Alas my ancient bones would not allow me to stand or slowly walk to see the exhibits but we did explore the structure itself",
          "The building by a Japanese architect is amazing with an undulated roof on pillars, which look like tree trunks. Currently, there is an interesting exposition about colour.",
          "we waited too long to visit The permanent collection is already worth the trip but \"La Nuit\" was extraordinary. I also recommend the restaurant on the roof top, the setting might be a little bit better but the food, and the service where absolute top",
          "Interesting idea of a night paintings in the dark, nice collection as well. The building designed by Japanese architect is worth visiting itself. I let you find out his name. :) Picasso is present as well, with his painting of a nude in bed.",
          "The Centre Pompidou Metz located close to the train station right outside town. Built in 2006 it holds a large array of modern art pieces.",
          "Situated in walking distance from the railwaystation, the building itself is very special and gives good possibilities for picture taking. When coming by train from Luxembourg, you should take advantage of the \"combi-ticket\" to be bought for a total 25 Euros per adult, which",
          "they have a big reserve of world art objects , but now , the temporary exhibition , \" paint the night \" , is a must",

          "When we were here, there was a mildly interesting Colours and Light exhibition on the first floor. But the Couples Modernes exhibition on the remaining floors was very interesting! Certainly worth a visit! Add to that the nice building, and the closeness to the city centre. If",

          "Large building of modern design; the glass sided lifts can be disconcerting if you're not used to them. Three of the four floors were in use for exhibitions when we visited. I thought the standard of works was variable with some extremely good and some space fillers, but",
          "We managed to catch the last day of a temporary exhibit and the three floors of permanant exhibits (we assumed they were pemanent). The temp exhibit obviously took a lot to set up and a lot of effort to watch.. The permanent floors could have taken more time than we had to",

          "The building has very good architecture. In total it is four floors but two floors were empty as there was one exhibition. The exhibition I saw was very interesting with the title \u201cDumb Type\u201d, it was definitely worth seeing.",
          "I\u2019m quite surprised this is so far down on the list of attractions in Metz. I\u2019ve visited museums all over the world and truly enjoyed the creativity and art here...also included some original Matisse art. In general, we enjoyed the city of Metz immensely, in great part as it is",
          "The museum has a unique architecture to marvel at. Inside there are several temporary exhibitions. Worth a visit.",
          "Reasonably priced. A modern building, very bright and clean. Interesting but I am afraid that modern art is not for me.",
          "Very Nice building. Its a Little bit pitty That the building is surrounded with ugly buildings. There are 3 galleries, but only 1 was open. :-(",
          "Only two small exhibitions, two levels empty. Interesting building from the outside but nothing special in the use of light or space indoors. There are many far more interesting museums in the world.",
          "Three times so far the CP Metz has attracted our interest. We travelled from Zurich to Metz and stayed there for a couple of days. The museum has an excellent reputation and the exhibitions are carefully curated. We are addicted to it. And Metz is a lovely city.....",
          "Even if you, like me, is not a big fan of modern art - the centre Pompidou is well worth a visit. The building has interesting architecture and the exhibitions are of high class. I enjoyed the challenge I gave myself to go there with open eyes and try to learn something about an",

          "It was our mistake for going to the museum two hours before it closed. We didn\u2019t want to leave after that. The staff is kind and helpful and the museum is so spacious you don\u2019t feel claustrophobic at all. Also the entry is free for people under 26.",
          "Le centre Pompidou est \u00e0 quelques pas de la gare. It is only 10 years old but is already known as one of the most wonderful museum/art display in France. Unique place in this wonderful old town. The Japanese exhibition is well worth seeing right now.",
          "Not only is the architecture of this building most creative and impressive, the current exhibition on Japan is also to be recommended!",
          "If you are a fan of modern architecture, you have to go and see the new museum. The big foyer is amazing.",
          "I have wanted desperately to see any of Shigaru Ban's creations since I first saw a photo of the Centre Pompidou-Metz. Fortunately, I needed to be in Germany after a visit to Brussels. Metz is right in-between and has excellent restaurants, patisseries and markets. Let me say",
          "It's seems that the design team could not really decide what type of structure they wanted so the decided that steel, wood and fabric would be the right mix but what an expensive mess.",
          "Let me start off with the fact that I had been wanting to visit the Centre Pompidou since first visiting Metz. We finally made it last weekend and I found the architecture to be the most interesting part of my visit. Of the three collections I visited the first one of Fernand",
          "Despite the cafe being half empty on a Sunday afternoon at 2.30 we were told we couldn't sit at a table because they were reserved for people ordering food. If we wanted drinks only we had to sit near the bar on high stools. This despite half of the seated \"diners\" only",
          "Many people have been to Centre Pompidou in Paris, but the one in Metz is just as good! The building itself is absolutely jaw-droppingly stuning form outside as well as inside. The exhibits are very impressive and many are thought-provoking. I easily spent over 3 hours inside",
          "Do you love art? Yes? Then you have to visit this art stand. The way you depict individual exposures will make you think about their own meaning. The gallery is generously spacious and it is a great shame to visit her during one hour (take at least 2-3 hours). I appreciate the",
          "The building is architectonic impressive. The standard collection was not impressive. Nevertheless we visited the temporary exhibition of L\u00e9ger.",
          "There were a few exhibits when we visited. We thought they offered a good variety. We loved the Leger exhibit - really feel we know a lot about an artist we knew little about before, and it was great how they had it laid out and we could see how is work changed over the years.",
          "Unbelievable wooden constructed exhibition center. Currently displaying an interesting modern art collection over three floors.",
          "Of the three current exhibitions, one was a complete mystery to us, but that on the earth'[s environment in the cosmos and the one featuring Fernand L\u00e9ger's work were very good. The presentation was outstanding. Well worth a visit - just for the building!",
          "for euros 10, you have : a fantastic building, and at least 3 exhibitions of modern art , and more ,, their restaurant \" la voile blanche \" is a must",
          "Although with young children they enjoyed it very much. Inspiring and giving a boost to the visit in Metz",
          "We are spoiled for galleries being from London but this is still an absolute treat. Beautifully curated with some really fabulous pieces. Must see if you're in Metz!",
          "The building itself is very impressive and worth a visit. The exhibitions are also very good and the little shop has some good books and design objects for sale.",
          "This terrific museum is associated with the Louvre. Its focus is on Modern Art and on large installations that would be impossible to mount at the main museum in Paris. The building is terrific and you should go and see it even if you are not interested in the exhibits. We saw",
          "Hoped to see more art but actually it was disappointing not a lot to see otherwise the building is quite impressive",
          "Not one of my favorite museums, but it was probably just the exhibition that was available. We saw the \"Art and music\" exhibition, and I found it to be odd, boring and nothing I would want to see again. There is, however a room full of nothing. Yes, nothing. And this is art???",
          "Not a big fan of modern art, but was looking forward to the building itself. Yes it is impressive when you arrive, but once inside it lets you down. There was no wow factor after having paid your entrance fee, in fact some materials looked cheap and showed signs of ageing",
          "Interesting building, peaceful environment, different and insightful pieces of art.Had the guide visit and it was really good for different points of view and a better understanding of it.",
          "First, expected something more from the exterior. But I think it should look great from the sky. And what was really nice that the curves and shapes of the building were also \"mirrored\" on the territory surrounding the museum (take a look on the grass before entering or after",
          "First of all, there are so many ways of getting in for free, you just have to ask - as a student, senior, teacher, etc. However, I would have paid whatever price they charged for seeing all we got to see. There was 2 exceptional exhibits - musicircus and world disasters in",
          "The building architecture is amazing. When I visited some rooms were closed unfortunately. Anyway it is worth a visit mainly for the interesting modern structure of the building.",
          "...disappointing on the inside...looks as if the architect didn\u00b4t see his ideas through, the building would offer so much potential yet inside it\u00b4s like a hazardous collection of rooms and cubicles, materials used and finish are partially of very poor quality, a shame.",
          "Imposing modern building. We were disappointed with the modest collection of displayed art objects. The available space is overwhelming. We would have loved to see more than the thematic objects of the \"Musicircus\".",
          "We inserted a special etappe coming back from the south to visit the Centre Pompidou. We read about opening hours in a brochure about Metz (open till 8 pm) but to our surprise the centre closed at 6pm, so we had to do the last exposition in a rush. There is no permanent",
          "Lovers of modern architecture and of modern art will find this a must-visit destination, conveniently located next to the beautiful train station.",
          "Any museum is defined by the exhibit which is on at the time, but this one is also interesting for the architecture. It looks very strange in the photos, but is actually three oblong boxes stacked on top of each other with a wood and nylon roof. Quite outstanding and worth",
          "Just visited earlier today. Was pleased by the quality of the shows and really enjoyed it. Architecture and area are really disappointing though and scenography could be more contemporary. Also won't recommend the restaurant.",
          "Architecture beautiful, it is the highlight of Metz. The museum itself is the biggest attraction. Recommended.",
          "We took the bus. The museum is in a place that looks the end of the town. We visited only the store since we didn't have time to visit the exhibits. The store had little to offer.",
          "The 1st floor was weird, and nothing special, the 2nd was a bit better , the 3rd was closed, restaurant - work in progress , so was just a way to spent 1 hour and half but nothing special",
          "The Japanese architect of this contraption must have taken his design inspiration from the Smurf Village when he came up with this strange fabric roof structure, a true eyesore and foreign object in the city fabric indeed. (The former amusement parc \"The New World of the",
          "You shouldn't judge a book by its cover. Nevertheless first appearances count. The building, which is quite impressive, is situated on a shabby looking space adjacent to a dull park landscape. We wanted to order a cup of coffee in the museum before starting the visit. But",
          "It's good but not that good. But being a sign of metz people look forward to going here. It's a museum basically with stuff changing every season. Do look for free visits. Otherwise too its not expensive to go",
          "I have been there a couple of times and every time is better than the previous one. The exhibitions on display change rapidly, so if you see something of your interest, run for it!",
          "The building looks great from the outside and our 7 year old said her teacher was talking to the class about how good it was here (she goes to school in Luxembourg). We all had high expectations but we were all sadly very disappointed. We paid 10 euro each for entry on a Sunday",
          "We first visited when it had just opened, and it felt like a wonderful space, and had a fantastic exhibition. This time, not quite so good - the shows were OK, the shop was sparse, and the cafe was closed. And the parking remains a mystery!",
          "I visited for the first time the museum in opening year 2010: the exhibition \"chef d'oeuvres\" was greate. Now 6 years after only around 50-60% of the exhibition area was open. The current exhibitions were not very passionating. Nicest thing is the architecture of the",
          "The building is amazing and I love the structure of it. I was a little dispointed because of the things you could see inside. I don't know why but I expected more. It was very good and very nice and some works blow my mind. But still there was something that I missed. Because",
          "During our short visit we stopped by the Centre Pompidou. Certainly worth a visit. We saw the exibition of TADASHI KAWAMATA, which is still on till 15 08 2016.",
          "The museum itself is a piece of art. The glue-lam structure is a masterpiece and is a place to visit for any kind of architectural inspiration. The making process of the building is explained after the museum visit, in a room next to the library, and could deserve a bigger place",
          "The building is quite something! However we were quite disappointed when visiting inside: no permanent collection, and at the time of our visit, only 2 small exhibitions. We were done in not even 2 hours! Definitely doesn't measure up to the Pompidou Museum in Paris.",
          "This attraction was the highlight of our trip to Metz. Strangely, this site is not even mentioned in the latest version of the Michelin Green Guide for Alsace-Lorraine-Champagne. The art started outside with the stunning architecture and only got better. The entry fee of 12",
          "The architecture is impressive and lived up to expectations. We had no idea of what exhibitions were on and found the exhibition on the sublime to be intriguing, baffling and at times fascinating. The huge tsunami installation was truly amazing. All in all, we were so glad that",
          "The Centre Pompidou in Metz is not a branch of its illustrious cousin, but an autonomous exhibition and performance space. The downstairs 'nave' can accommodate enormous canvases and structures and plate-glass walls at either end of the upper floor display rooms provide not only",
          "As a second time visitor, the cost of 10 euros for two new exhibitions was excessive. After entering, there is a strange system where you go up two escalators to, well, nothing and everyone congregates until they have to take the emergency exit stairs to the first exhibit on the",
          "We walked through the railway station and followed the path to see this building and although there were a couple of exhibitions on, neither of them interested us. However the architecture is the draw card for the building. We did visit the gift shop and found a book in English",
          "The architecture is impressive! However I was a little bit disappointed inside because in this moment they closed some rooms in order to prepare upcoming exhibitions. Well.. I just need to go back there next month. The interior view of the carpentry structure is amazing! On",
          "One of the best artistic options for a relatively small town, with fine contemporary state-of-the-art exhibitions. If the artistic part does not meet your interests, it is worth paying 10 euros and visiting all floors, enjoying the architecture from the inside and taking great",
          "This somewhat new offshoot of the Pompidou in Paris houses temporary exhibits from there. At this time, the entire second floor had an extensive Andy Warhol exhibit. The third floor was between exhibkts so was closed and the first flloor had paintings by 20th century artists",
          "A very modern structure with several exhibitions ( permanent and temporary. Characterised by large modern exhibits of uneven quality. Not particularly our taste. Architecture is better than exhibits. A temporary exhibit about Andy Warhol was particularly interesting with a",
          "Good but not great. The building is interesting but the exhibition was rather plain. I personally much prefer the one in Paris.",
          "it's a place to pass by , even if you only enter the lobby to admire the architecture. At a very democratic price you can visit 4 expositions (4 floors) the museum has a good overall feeling, and it feels nice strolling around and admiring the objects on display. It's not the",
          "This impressive architectural structure houses a nice quantity of modern art. Its huge internal space makes it possible to expose very large pieces of art. The temporary exhibition of Andy Warhol is worth a visit!",
          "I accidentally bought tickets for this museum instead of the one in Paris. They have no warnings on their website. They are refusing to refund my money. How nasty!",
          "Start with the building itself and taking time to look over the construction and use of materials sets the tone for a visit. Inside we had a range of challenging art exhibitions from Warhol to Picasso.....some you'll get straight away others leave you simply wondering what it's",
          "Although I am not a fan of architecture, this building and the entrance was amazing. I only visited the main floor since I did not have time to visit the galleries. I really liked the musical pool at the entrance.",

          "We were passing through Metz on our way to Luxembourg when we remembered that the Pompidou Centre was here. The staff were friendly and understood basic English so we could get out tickets (teenagers and younger go free). For a small price we managed to have a very enjoyable",

          "This is definitely one of the highlight of Metz. The building has a visible, very impressive construction and is a work of art in itself. On the ground floor is a round pool, filled with bone china bowls. They swirl around gently in the pool and this makes a fairytale sound.",
          "We did not go in, only walked to the museum for a few nice pictures. It was not too far of a walk and it was worth it. The wooden beams add an old world charm to a modern building.",

          "An interesting building, but the quality and quantity of the art was very disappointing. Given how much undisplayed art languishes in Paris, this new centre could have offered so much more. Sadly worth neither the time or money for a visit.",

        "wiki": "Metz ( METS, French: [m\u025bs] (listen), Lorraine Franconian: [m\u025bts]) Latin: Divodurum Mediomatricorum is a city in northeast France located at the confluence of the Moselle and the Seille rivers. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle department and the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region. Located near the tripoint along the junction of France, Germany, and Luxembourg, the city forms a central place of the European Greater Region and the SaarLorLux euroregion.Metz has a rich 3,000-year-history, having variously been a Celtic oppidum, an important Gallo-Roman city, the Merovingian capital of Austrasia, the birthplace of the Carolingian dynasty, a cradle of the Gregorian chant, and one of the oldest republics in Europe. The city has been steeped in Romance culture, but has been strongly influenced by Germanic culture due to its location and history.Because of its historical, cultural, and architectural background, Metz has been submitted on France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. The city features noteworthy buildings such as the Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral with its largest expanse of stained-glass windows in the world, the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains being the oldest church in France, its Imperial Station Palace displaying the apartment of the German Kaiser, or its Opera House, the oldest one working in France. Metz is home to some world-class venues including the Arsenal Concert Hall and the Centre Pompidou-Metz museum.\nA basin of urban ecology, Metz gained its nickname of The Green City (French: La Ville Verte), as it has extensive open grounds and public gardens. The historic city centre is one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France.A historic garrison town, Metz is the economic heart of the Lorraine region, specialising in information technology and automotive industries. Metz is home to the University of Lorraine, Georgia Tech Lorraine, and a centre for applied research and development in the materials sector, notably in metallurgy and metallography, the heritage of the Lorraine region's past in the iron and steel industry.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn ancient times, the town was known as \"city of Mediomatrici\", being inhabited by the tribe of the same name. After its integration into the Roman Empire, the city was called Divodurum Mediomatricum, meaning Holy Village or Holy Fortress of the Mediomatrici, then it was known as Mediomatrix. During the 5th century AD, the name evolved to \"Mettis\", which gave rise to Metz.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMetz has a recorded history dating back over 2,000 years. Before the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar in 52 BC, it was the oppidum of the Celtic Mediomatrici tribe. Integrated into the Roman Empire, Metz became quickly one of the principal towns of Gaul with a population of 40,000, until the barbarian depredations and its transfer to the Franks about the end of the 5th century. Between the 6th and 8th centuries, the city was the residence of the Merovingian kings of Austrasia. After the Treaty of Verdun in 843, Metz became the capital of the Kingdom of Lotharingia and was ultimately integrated into the Holy Roman Empire, being granted semi-independent status. During the 12th century, Metz became a republic and the Republic of Metz stood until the 15th century.With the signature of the Treaty of Chambord in 1552, Metz passed to the hands of the Kings of France. As the German Protestant Princes who traded Metz (alongside Toul and Verdun) for the promise of French military assistance, had no authority to cede territory of the Holy Roman Empire, the change of jurisdiction wasn't recognised by the Holy Roman Empire until the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. Under French rule, Metz was selected as capital of the Three Bishoprics and became a strategic fortified town. With creation of the departments by the Estates-General of 1789, Metz was chosen as capital of the Department of Moselle. Although French-speaking, after the Franco-Prussian War and according to the Treaty of Frankfurt of 1871, the city was annexed into the German Empire, being part of the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine and serving as capital of the Bezirk Lothringen.Metz remained German until the end of World War I, when it reverted to France. However, after the Battle of France during the Second World War, the city was annexed once more by the German Third Reich. In 1944, the attack on the city by the U.S. Third Army freed the city from German rule and Metz reverted one more time to France after World War II.During the 1950s, Metz was chosen to be the capital of the newly created Lorraine region. With the creation of the European Community and the later European Union, the city has become central to the Greater Region and the SaarLorLux Euroregion.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMetz is located on the banks of the Moselle and the Seille rivers, 43 km (26.7 mi) from the Schengen tripoint where the borders of France, Germany, and Luxembourg meet. The city was built in a place where many branches of the Moselle river creates several islands, which are encompassed within the urban planning.The terrain of Metz forms part of the Paris Basin and presents a plateau relief cut by river valleys presenting cuestas in the north\u2013south direction. Metz and its surrounding countryside are included in the forest and crop Lorraine Regional Natural Park, covering a total area of 205,000 ha (506,566.0 acres).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of Lorraine is a semi-continental climate. The summers are warm and humid, sometimes stormy, and the warmest month of the year is July, when daytime temperatures average approximately 25 \u00b0C (77.0 \u00b0F). The winters are cold and snowy with temperature dropping to an average low of \u22120.5 \u00b0C (31.1 \u00b0F) in January. Lows can be much colder through the night and early morning and the snowy period extends from November to February.The length of the day varies significantly over the course of the year. The shortest day is 21 December with 7:30 hours of sunlight; the longest day is 20 June with 16:30 hours of sunlight. The median cloud cover is 93% and does not vary substantially over the course of the year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nThe inhabitants of Metz are called Messin(e)s. Statistics on the ethnic and religious make up of the population of Metz are haphazard, as the French Republic prohibits making distinctions between citizens regarding race, beliefs, and political and philosophic opinions in the process of census taking. This would otherwise document the city to be a Germanic locale, as is the rest of the province and the neighboring Alsace.The French national census of 2012 estimated the population of Metz to be 119,551, while the population of Metz urban agglomeration was about 389,851. Through history, Metz's population has been impacted by the vicissitudes of the wars and annexations involving the city, which have prevented continuous population growth. More recently, the city has suffered from the restructuring of the military and the metallurgy industry. The historical population for the current area of Metz municipality is as follows:\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\nSeveral well-known figures have been linked to the city of Metz throughout its history. Renowned Messins include poet Paul Verlaine, composer Ambroise Thomas, and mathematician Jean-Victor Poncelet; numerous well-known German figures were also born in Metz notably during the annexation periods. Moreover, the city has been the residence of people such as writer Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Cardinal Mazarin, political thinker Alexis de Tocqueville, French patriot and American Revolutionary War hero Marquis Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette, and Luxembourg-born German-French statesman Robert Schuman.\n\n\n== Law and government ==\n\n\n=== Local law ===\n\nThe Local Law (French: droit local) applied in Metz is a legal system that operates in parallel with French law. Created in 1919, it preserves the French laws applied in France before 1870 and maintained by the Germans during the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, but repealed in the rest of France after 1871. It also maintains German laws enacted by the German Empire between 1871 and 1918, specific provisions adopted by the local authorities, and French laws that have been enacted after 1919 to be applicable only in Alsace-Lorraine. This specific local legislation encompasses different areas including religion, social work and finance.\nThe most striking of the legal differences between France and Alsace-Lorraine is the absence in Alsace-Lorraine of strict secularism, even though a constitutional right of freedom of religion is guaranteed by the French government. Alsace-Lorraine is still governed by a pre-1905 law established by the Concordat of 1801, which provides for the public subsidy of the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches and the Jewish religion.\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\nLike every commune of the present French Republic, Metz is managed by a mayor (French: maire) and a municipal council (French: conseil municipal), democratically elected by two-round proportional voting for six years. The mayor is assisted by 54 municipal councillors, and the municipal council is held on the last Thursday of every month. Since 2008, the mayor of Metz has been socialist Dominique Gros.The city belongs to the Metz Metropole union of cities, which includes the 40 cities of the Metz urban agglomeration. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle based in the former Intendant Palace. In addition, Metz is the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region, hosted in the former Saint-Clement Abbey.\n\n\n=== City administrative divisions ===\n\nThe city of Metz is divided into 14 administrative divisions:\n\n\n== Cityscape and environmental policy ==\n\nMetz contains a mishmash of architectural layers, bearing witness to centuries of history at the crossroads of different cultures, and features a number of architectural landmarks. The city possesses one of the largest Urban Conservation Areas in France, and more than 100 of the city's buildings are classified on the Monument Historique list. Because of its historical and cultural background, Metz is designated as French Town of Art and History, and has been submitted on to France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List.The city is famous for its yellow limestone architecture, a result of the extensive use of Jaumont stone. The historic district has kept part of the Gallo-Roman city with Divodurum's Cardo Maximus, then called Via Scarponensis (today the Trinitaires, Taison, and Serpenoise streets), and the Decumanus Maximus (today En Fournirue and d'Estr\u00e9es streets). At the Cardo and Decumanus intersection was situated the Roman forum, today the Saint-Jacques Square.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nFrom its Gallo-Roman past, the city preserves vestiges of the thermae (in the basement of the Golden Courtyard museum), parts of the aqueduct, and the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains.Saint Louis' square with its vaulted arcades and a Knights Templar chapel remains a major symbol of the city's High Medieval heritage. The Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral, several churches and H\u00f4tels, and two remarkable municipal granaries reflect the Late Middle Ages. Examples of Renaissance architecture can be seen in H\u00f4tels from the 16th century, such as the House of Heads (French: Maison des T\u00eates).The city hall and the buildings surrounding the town square are by French architect Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Blondel, who was awarded the task of redesigning and modernizing the centre of Metz by the Royal Academy of Architecture in 1755 the context of the Enlightenment. Neoclassical buildings from the 18th century, such as the Opera House, the Intendant Palace (the present-day prefecture), and the Royal Governor's Palace (the present-day courthouse) built by Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau, are also found in the city.The Imperial District was built during the first annexation of Metz by the German Empire. In order to \"germanise\" the city, Emperor Wilhelm II decided to create a new district shaped by a distinctive blend of Germanic architecture, including Renaissance, neo-Romanesque and neo-Classical, mixed with elements of Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Alsatian and mock-Bavarian styles. Instead of Jaumont stone, commonly used everywhere else in the city, stone used in the Rhineland, such as pink and grey sandstone, granite and basalt were used. The district features noteworthy buildings including the rail station and the Central Post Office by German architect J\u00fcrgen Kr\u00f6ger.Modern architecture can also be seen in the town with works of French architects Roger-Henri Expert (Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-de-l'Enfant-J\u00e9sus church, 1934), Georges-Henri Pingusson (Fire Station, 1960), and Jean Dubuisson (subdivisions, 1960s). The refurbishment of the former Ney Arsenal as a Concert Hall in 1989 and the erection of the Metz Arena in 2002, by Spanish and French architects Ricardo Bofill and French Paul Chemetov represent the Postmodern movement.The Centre Pompidou-Metz museum in the Amphitheatre District represents a strong architectural initiative to mark the entrance of Metz into the 21st century. Designed by Japanese architect Shigeru Ban, the building is remarkable for the complex, innovative carpentry of its roof, and integrates concepts of sustainable architecture. The project encompasses the architecture of two recipients of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, Shigeru Ban (2014) and French Christian de Portzamparc (1994). The Amphitheatre District is also conceived by French architects Nicolas Michelin, Jean-Paul Viguier, and Jean-Michel Wilmotte and designer Philippe Starck. The urban project is expected to be completed by 2023. Further, a contemporary music venue designed by contextualist French architect Rudy Ricciotti stands in the Borny District.\n\n\n=== Urban ecology ===\n\nUnder the leadership of such people as botanist Jean-Marie Pelt, Metz pioneered a policy of urban ecology during the early 1970s. Because of the failure of post-war urban planning and housing estate development in Europe during the 1960s, mostly based on the concepts of CIAM, Jean-Marie Pelt, then municipal councillor of Metz, initiated a new approach to the urban environment.Based initially on the ideas of the Chicago School, Pelt's theories pleaded for better integration of humans into their environment and developed a concept centered on the relationship between \"stone and water\". His policy was realized in Metz by the establishment of extensive open areas surrounding the Moselle and the Seille rivers and the development of large pedestrian areas. As a result, Metz has over 37 m2 (400 sq ft) of open areas per inhabitant in the form of numerous public gardens in the city.The principles of urban ecology are still applied in Metz with the implementation of a local Agenda 21 action plan. The municipal ecological policy encompasses the sustainable refurbishment of ancient buildings, the erection of sustainable districts and buildings, green public transport, and the creation of public gardens by means of landscape architecture.Additionally, the city has developed its own combined heat and power station, using waste wood biomass from the surrounding forests as a renewable energy source.

The Metz power station is the first local producer and distributor of energy in France.\n\n\n=== Military architecture ===\n\nAs a historic Garrison town, Metz has been heavily influenced by military architecture throughout its history. From ancient history to the present, the city has been successively fortified and modified to accommodate the troops stationed there. Defensive walls from classical antiquity to the 20th century are still visible today, incorporated into the design of public gardens along the Moselle and Seille rivers. A medieval bridge castle from the 13th century, named Germans' Gate (French: Porte des Allemands), today converted into a convention and exhibition centre, has become one of the landmarks of the city. It is still possible to see parts of the 16th century citadel, as well as fortifications built in the 1740s by Louis de Cormontaigne but based on designs by Vauban. Important barracks, mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries, are spread around the city: some, which are of architectural interest, have been converted to civilian use, such as the Arsenal Concert Hall by Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill.\nThe extensive fortifications of Metz, which ring the city, include early examples of S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res system forts. Other forts were incorporated into the Maginot Line. A hiking trail on the Saint-Quentin plateau passes through a former military training zone and ends at the now abandoned military forts, providing a vantage point from which to survey the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAlthough the steel industry has historically dominated Moselle's economy, Metz's efforts at economic diversification have created a base in the sectors of commerce, tourism, information technology and the automotive industry. The city is the economic heart of the Lorraine region and around 73,000 people work daily within the urban agglomeration. The transport facilities found in the conurbation, including the international high-speed railway, motorway, inland connections and the local bus rapid transit system, have made the city a transport hub in the heart of the European Union. Metz is home to the biggest harbour handling cereals in France with over 4,000,000 tons/year.Metz is home to the Moselle Chamber of Commerce. International companies such as PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, ArcelorMittal, SFR, and TDF have established plants and centres in the Metz conurbation.

For instance, Gregorian chant was created in Metz during the 8th century as a fusion of Gallican and ancient Roman repertory. Then called Messin Chant, it remains the oldest form of music still in use in Western Europe. The bishops of Metz, notably Saint-Chrodegang promoted its use for the Roman liturgy in Gallic lands under the favorable influence of the Carolingian monarchs. Messin chant made two major contributions to the body of chant: it fitted the chant into the ancient Greek octoechos system, and invented an innovative musical notation, using neumes to show the shape of a remembered melody. Metz was also an important centre of illumination of Carolingian manuscripts, producing such monuments of Carolingian book illumination as the Drogo Sacramentary.The Metz School (French: \u00c9cole de Metz) was an art movement in Metz and the region between 1834 and 1870, centred on Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal. The term was originally proposed in 1845 by the poet Charles Baudelaire, who appreciated the works of the artists. They were influenced by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix and inspired by the medieval heritage of Metz and its romantic surroundings. The Franco-Prussian War and the annexation of the territory by the Germans resulted in the dismantling of the movement. The main figures of the Metz School were Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, Auguste Migette, Auguste Hussenot, Louis-Th\u00e9odore Devilly, Christopher Fratin, and Charles P\u00eatre. Their works include paintings, engravings, drawings, stained-glass windows, and sculptures.\nA festival named \"passages\" takes place in May. Numerous shows are presented to it.\n\n\n=== The Graoully dragon as symbol of the city ===\n\nThe Graoully is depicted as a fearsome dragon, vanquished by the sacred powers of Saint Clement of Metz, the first Bishop of the city. The Graoully quickly became a symbol of Metz and can be seen in numerous insignia of the city, from the 10th century on. Writers from Metz tend to present the legend as an allegory of Christianity's victory over paganism, represented by the harmful dragon.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nLocal specialties include the quiche, the pot\u00e9e, the Lorrain p\u00e2t\u00e9, and also suckling pig.

Also, Metz is the cradle of some pastries like the Metz cheese pie and the Metz Balls (French: boulet de Metz), a ganache-stuffed biscuit coated with marzipan, caramel, and dark chocolate. Local beverages include Moselle wine and Amos beer.The Covered Market of Metz is one of the oldest, most grandiose in France and is home to traditional local food producers and retailers. Originally built as the bishop's palace, the French Revolution broke out before the Bishop of Metz could move in and the citizens decided to turn it into a food market.

In 1996, the engineering school Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech (ENSAM) built a research and learning center next to the golf course. This opened the way to the development of a new area, where the Franco-German university (ISFATES) and the ENIM moved in 2010. These graduate schools often cooperate with the University of Lorraine.

          "First off, it's amazing. Best cathedral I've seen of the 10 or so since I moved here 2 months ago. However I was taken aback by the gift shop in the middle of the sanctuary. And the scammers they have charging 4 Euros to use the toilet in the catacombs that laugh when you",

          "Of strategic importance for over 700 years, this gate is a reminder of the fortifications that once surrounded the area. The rooms located within the main gate house a limited number of interests; however the views from the towers are worth the climb up the narrow staircase.",
          "Worth a look if you are in this part of town. There is not a lot to see. There is access to pleasant walking trails along the river and old city walls.",

          "Well worth the walk to the end of town to see this beautiful and historic gate to the city.... and it's free.",
          "This gate together with the city walls was the place I liked most in Metz. We spent a long time here, taking pictures, searching for the best view, excited like kids. I only missed information in English or German.",
          "We went to visit Marche Couvert, and when we finished we walked down to visit Porte des Allemands (Germans' Gate). The walk to the gate was well worth the walk, and I would recommend it to anyone in the area. It is the last remaining castle bridge in France, and it is in",
          "Loved this place. The history is so amazing for this piece of history. You can walk around the roof and imagine how it must have been. There is a small historical center that you can walk around. It also has a very clean bathroom.",

          "Built just before Metz became a republic in 1234, the Porte des Allemands takes its name from its location: just at the end of the rue des Allemands. Remodeled and restored regularly over the centuries it combines many differing architectural styles, some of which were removed",
          "This site, although on the Michelin walking tour, is a bit out of the way unless you are walking the ramparts path along the Seille/Moselle or visiting the Churches of Ste. Eucarie and Ste. Maximin. Nonetheless it is worth the trek. It appears to be intact with its original",
          "We walked from the Circuit des Remparts to this Fort with the expectation that we would be able to visit the interior, however it is only open from 2 - 5 pm Monday to Saturday. We did take some nice pictures of the building as you are able to walk through the gates. From what",

          "This is a smallish fortress. Nicely preserved, has a pretty view of the \"moat\" (part of the Seille river). Would make a nice ending (or beginning) for a walk along the Seille/Moselle in Metz",
          "There is not much here, but what little there is to look at is quite nice. The views of the river are nice. The structure is on a small island. It must have been quite impressive in its day. It is worth the time for a quick walk.",
          "If you take the stroll along the esplanade you can't miss this stone structure, all part of the fortification system developed in the 14th century if I read the French signage correctly.. The esplanade walk is worth the trip by itself and seeing a structure like this along the",
          "Not a castle, but rather an ancient entry way into the city. Nice to see. On the edge of town so walking there is a little far, but no bad at all. Combine it with a stroll to the Saint Maximin church to see the Jean Cocteau designed stained-glass window.",
          "This was a charming little castle and well worth the visit. My brother and I visited in January and it was a free admission (not sure if it's that way year round). It's not a large castle by any stretch, but it's certainly a fun, scenic visit-- and a great way to cross back",
          "Most impressive fortifications and port of entry into the medieval town. The towers and walls are well preserved and the location near the Seille awards Porte des Allemands a most romantic appearance. Not to be missed on a visit to Metz although it is slightly off the beaten",

          "With its interesting history, the porte des allemands was one of the highlights of our stroll through Metz. Very impressive with its different towers, its inner and outer gate and situated right above the Seille river.",
          "We visited in May, 2014 and it was still closed for renovations but even without going in I thought it was an interesting visit. I think I was expecting something a little bigger but was still pretty cool to look at and easy to photograph. Its very close to the downtown area",
          "Of course we disliked not being able to go inside. Thus the average rating. Now for the reason I think this is a must see and we would return again even knowing that it's currently closed: Architecturally interesting monument from one of the many periods of German control.",
          "It will be good to see again when they are finished with the restauration works. It's off the beaten path in this city and not well sign posted, but we found our way through the less-than upper class area. Looked to be some decent places to eat there, too!",
          "We made a completely spontaneous trip to Metz one weekend because we saw there was cheap train fare and we had never been there before. We loved our time here and it was a wonderful city just to walk around in. The Porte des Allemands is a great example of free, picturesque",

          "In just one day, doing all what we've done was hard, but really appagant. Entering here is like to be back in the MiddleAges, you can see the river from the above and... it's free!!!",
          "I can't exactly explain why I liked this site as much as I did. Since Metz was an enormous fortress-city, it was like that last piece of the puzzle for my imagination to envision the city during Mideval times. If you visit the Porte des Allemands, make sure you walk north",
          "This structure, a rebuilding of the ancient gate of the city is fun to visit and very photogenic. Don't miss.",

        "wiki": "Metz ( METS, French: [m\u025bs] (listen), Lorraine Franconian: [m\u025bts]) Latin: Divodurum Mediomatricorum is a city in northeast France located at the confluence of the Moselle and the Seille rivers. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle department and the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region. Located near the tripoint along the junction of France, Germany, and Luxembourg, the city forms a central place of the European Greater Region and the SaarLorLux euroregion.Metz has a rich 3,000-year-history, having variously been a Celtic oppidum, an important Gallo-Roman city, the Merovingian capital of Austrasia, the birthplace of the Carolingian dynasty, a cradle of the Gregorian chant, and one of the oldest republics in Europe. The city has been steeped in Romance culture, but has been strongly influenced by Germanic culture due to its location and history.Because of its historical, cultural, and architectural background, Metz has been submitted on France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. The city features noteworthy buildings such as the Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral with its largest expanse of stained-glass windows in the world, the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains being the oldest church in France, its Imperial Station Palace displaying the apartment of the German Kaiser, or its Opera House, the oldest one working in France. Metz is home to some world-class venues including the Arsenal Concert Hall and the Centre Pompidou-Metz museum.\nA basin of urban ecology, Metz gained its nickname of The Green City (French: La Ville Verte), as it has extensive open grounds and public gardens. The historic city centre is one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France.A historic garrison town, Metz is the economic heart of the Lorraine region, specialising in information technology and automotive industries. Metz is home to the University of Lorraine, Georgia Tech Lorraine, and a centre for applied research and development in the materials sector, notably in metallurgy and metallography, the heritage of the Lorraine region's past in the iron and steel industry.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn ancient times, the town was known as \"city of Mediomatrici\", being inhabited by the tribe of the same name. After its integration into the Roman Empire, the city was called Divodurum Mediomatricum, meaning Holy Village or Holy Fortress of the Mediomatrici, then it was known as Mediomatrix. During the 5th century AD, the name evolved to \"Mettis\", which gave rise to Metz.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMetz has a recorded history dating back over 2,000 years. Before the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar in 52 BC, it was the oppidum of the Celtic Mediomatrici tribe. Integrated into the Roman Empire, Metz became quickly one of the principal towns of Gaul with a population of 40,000, until the barbarian depredations and its transfer to the Franks about the end of the 5th century. Between the 6th and 8th centuries, the city was the residence of the Merovingian kings of Austrasia. After the Treaty of Verdun in 843, Metz became the capital of the Kingdom of Lotharingia and was ultimately integrated into the Holy Roman Empire, being granted semi-independent status. During the 12th century, Metz became a republic and the Republic of Metz stood until the 15th century.With the signature of the Treaty of Chambord in 1552, Metz passed to the hands of the Kings of France. As the German Protestant Princes who traded Metz (alongside Toul and Verdun) for the promise of French military assistance, had no authority to cede territory of the Holy Roman Empire, the change of jurisdiction wasn't recognised by the Holy Roman Empire until the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. Under French rule, Metz was selected as capital of the Three Bishoprics and became a strategic fortified town. With creation of the departments by the Estates-General of 1789, Metz was chosen as capital of the Department of Moselle. Although French-speaking, after the Franco-Prussian War and according to the Treaty of Frankfurt of 1871, the city was annexed into the German Empire, being part of the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine and serving as capital of the Bezirk Lothringen.Metz remained German until the end of World War I, when it reverted to France. However, after the Battle of France during the Second World War, the city was annexed once more by the German Third Reich. In 1944, the attack on the city by the U.S. Third Army freed the city from German rule and Metz reverted one more time to France after World War II.During the 1950s, Metz was chosen to be the capital of the newly created Lorraine region. With the creation of the European Community and the later European Union, the city has become central to the Greater Region and the SaarLorLux Euroregion.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMetz is located on the banks of the Moselle and the Seille rivers, 43 km (26.7 mi) from the Schengen tripoint where the borders of France, Germany, and Luxembourg meet. The city was built in a place where many branches of the Moselle river creates several islands, which are encompassed within the urban planning.The terrain of Metz forms part of the Paris Basin and presents a plateau relief cut by river valleys presenting cuestas in the north\u2013south direction. Metz and its surrounding countryside are included in the forest and crop Lorraine Regional Natural Park, covering a total area of 205,000 ha (506,566.0 acres).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of Lorraine is a semi-continental climate. The summers are warm and humid, sometimes stormy, and the warmest month of the year is July, when daytime temperatures average approximately 25 \u00b0C (77.0 \u00b0F). The winters are cold and snowy with temperature dropping to an average low of \u22120.5 \u00b0C (31.1 \u00b0F) in January. Lows can be much colder through the night and early morning and the snowy period extends from November to February.The length of the day varies significantly over the course of the year. The shortest day is 21 December with 7:30 hours of sunlight; the longest day is 20 June with 16:30 hours of sunlight. The median cloud cover is 93% and does not vary substantially over the course of the year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nThe inhabitants of Metz are called Messin(e)s. Statistics on the ethnic and religious make up of the population of Metz are haphazard, as the French Republic prohibits making distinctions between citizens regarding race, beliefs, and political and philosophic opinions in the process of census taking. This would otherwise document the city to be a Germanic locale, as is the rest of the province and the neighboring Alsace.The French national census of 2012 estimated the population of Metz to be 119,551, while the population of Metz urban agglomeration was about 389,851. Through history, Metz's population has been impacted by the vicissitudes of the wars and annexations involving the city, which have prevented continuous population growth. More recently, the city has suffered from the restructuring of the military and the metallurgy industry. The historical population for the current area of Metz municipality is as follows:\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\nSeveral well-known figures have been linked to the city of Metz throughout its history. Renowned Messins include poet Paul Verlaine, composer Ambroise Thomas, and mathematician Jean-Victor Poncelet; numerous well-known German figures were also born in Metz notably during the annexation periods. Moreover, the city has been the residence of people such as writer Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Cardinal Mazarin, political thinker Alexis de Tocqueville, French patriot and American Revolutionary War hero Marquis Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette, and Luxembourg-born German-French statesman Robert Schuman.\n\n\n== Law and government ==\n\n\n=== Local law ===\n\nThe Local Law (French: droit local) applied in Metz is a legal system that operates in parallel with French law. Created in 1919, it preserves the French laws applied in France before 1870 and maintained by the Germans during the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, but repealed in the rest of France after 1871. It also maintains German laws enacted by the German Empire between 1871 and 1918, specific provisions adopted by the local authorities, and French laws that have been enacted after 1919 to be applicable only in Alsace-Lorraine. This specific local legislation encompasses different areas including religion, social work and finance.\nThe most striking of the legal differences between France and Alsace-Lorraine is the absence in Alsace-Lorraine of strict secularism, even though a constitutional right of freedom of religion is guaranteed by the French government. Alsace-Lorraine is still governed by a pre-1905 law established by the Concordat of 1801, which provides for the public subsidy of the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches and the Jewish religion.\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\nLike every commune of the present French Republic, Metz is managed by a mayor (French: maire) and a municipal council (French: conseil municipal), democratically elected by two-round proportional voting for six years. The mayor is assisted by 54 municipal councillors, and the municipal council is held on the last Thursday of every month. Since 2008, the mayor of Metz has been socialist Dominique Gros.The city belongs to the Metz Metropole union of cities, which includes the 40 cities of the Metz urban agglomeration. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle based in the former Intendant Palace. In addition, Metz is the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region, hosted in the former Saint-Clement Abbey.\n\n\n=== City administrative divisions ===\n\nThe city of Metz is divided into 14 administrative divisions:\n\n\n== Cityscape and environmental policy ==\n\nMetz contains a mishmash of architectural layers, bearing witness to centuries of history at the crossroads of different cultures, and features a number of architectural landmarks. The city possesses one of the largest Urban Conservation Areas in France, and more than 100 of the city's buildings are classified on the Monument Historique list. Because of its historical and cultural background, Metz is designated as French Town of Art and History, and has been submitted on to France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List.The city is famous for its yellow limestone architecture, a result of the extensive use of Jaumont stone. The historic district has kept part of the Gallo-Roman city with Divodurum's Cardo Maximus, then called Via Scarponensis (today the Trinitaires, Taison, and Serpenoise streets), and the Decumanus Maximus (today En Fournirue and d'Estr\u00e9es streets). At the Cardo and Decumanus intersection was situated the Roman forum, today the Saint-Jacques Square.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nFrom its Gallo-Roman past, the city preserves vestiges of the thermae (in the basement of the Golden Courtyard museum), parts of the aqueduct, and the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains.Saint Louis' square with its vaulted arcades and a Knights Templar chapel remains a major symbol of the city's High Medieval heritage. The Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral, several churches and H\u00f4tels, and two remarkable municipal granaries reflect the Late Middle Ages. Examples of Renaissance architecture can be seen in H\u00f4tels from the 16th century, such as the House of Heads (French: Maison des T\u00eates).The city hall and the buildings surrounding the town square are by French architect Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Blondel, who was awarded the task of redesigning and modernizing the centre of Metz by the Royal Academy of Architecture in 1755 the context of the Enlightenment. Neoclassical buildings from the 18th century, such as the Opera House, the Intendant Palace (the present-day prefecture), and the Royal Governor's Palace (the present-day courthouse) built by Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau, are also found in the city.The Imperial District was built during the first annexation of Metz by the German Empire. In order to \"germanise\" the city, Emperor Wilhelm II decided to create a new district shaped by a distinctive blend of Germanic architecture, including Renaissance, neo-Romanesque and neo-Classical, mixed with elements of Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Alsatian and mock-Bavarian styles. Instead of Jaumont stone, commonly used everywhere else in the city, stone used in the Rhineland, such as pink and grey sandstone, granite and basalt were used. The district features noteworthy buildings including the rail station and the Central Post Office by German architect J\u00fcrgen Kr\u00f6ger.Modern architecture can also be seen in the town with works of French architects Roger-Henri Expert (Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-de-l'Enfant-J\u00e9sus church, 1934), Georges-Henri Pingusson (Fire Station, 1960), and Jean Dubuisson (subdivisions, 1960s). The refurbishment of the former Ney Arsenal as a Concert Hall in 1989 and the erection of the Metz Arena in 2002, by Spanish and French architects Ricardo Bofill and French Paul Chemetov represent the Postmodern movement.The Centre Pompidou-Metz museum in the Amphitheatre District represents a strong architectural initiative to mark the entrance of Metz into the 21st century. Designed by Japanese architect Shigeru Ban, the building is remarkable for the complex, innovative carpentry of its roof, and integrates concepts of sustainable architecture. The project encompasses the architecture of two recipients of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, Shigeru Ban (2014) and French Christian de Portzamparc (1994). The Amphitheatre District is also conceived by French architects Nicolas Michelin, Jean-Paul Viguier, and Jean-Michel Wilmotte and designer Philippe Starck. The urban project is expected to be completed by 2023. Further, a contemporary music venue designed by contextualist French architect Rudy Ricciotti stands in the Borny District.\n\n\n=== Urban ecology ===\n\nUnder the leadership of such people as botanist Jean-Marie Pelt, Metz pioneered a policy of urban ecology during the early 1970s. Because of the failure of post-war urban planning and housing estate development in Europe during the 1960s, mostly based on the concepts of CIAM, Jean-Marie Pelt, then municipal councillor of Metz, initiated a new approach to the urban environment.Based initially on the ideas of the Chicago School, Pelt's theories pleaded for better integration of humans into their environment and developed a concept centered on the relationship between \"stone and water\". His policy was realized in Metz by the establishment of extensive open areas surrounding the Moselle and the Seille rivers and the development of large pedestrian areas. As a result, Metz has over 37 m2 (400 sq ft) of open areas per inhabitant in the form of numerous public gardens in the city.The principles of urban ecology are still applied in Metz with the implementation of a local Agenda 21 action plan. The municipal ecological policy encompasses the sustainable refurbishment of ancient buildings, the erection of sustainable districts and buildings, green public transport, and the creation of public gardens by means of landscape architecture.Additionally, the city has developed its own combined heat and power station, using waste wood biomass from the surrounding forests as a renewable energy source. With a thermal efficiency above 80%, the 45MW boiler of the plant provides electricity and heat for 44,000 dwellings. The Metz power station is the first local producer and distributor of energy in France.\n\n\n=== Military architecture ===\n\nAs a historic Garrison town, Metz has been heavily influenced by military architecture throughout its history. From ancient history to the present, the city has been successively fortified and modified to accommodate the troops stationed there. Defensive walls from classical antiquity to the 20th century are still visible today, incorporated into the design of public gardens along the Moselle and Seille rivers. A medieval bridge castle from the 13th century, named Germans' Gate (French: Porte des Allemands), today converted into a convention and exhibition centre, has become one of the landmarks of the city. It is still possible to see parts of the 16th century citadel, as well as fortifications built in the 1740s by Louis de Cormontaigne but based on designs by Vauban. Important barracks, mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries, are spread around the city: some, which are of architectural interest, have been converted to civilian use, such as the Arsenal Concert Hall by Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill.\nThe extensive fortifications of Metz, which ring the city, include early examples of S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res system forts. Other forts were incorporated into the Maginot Line. A hiking trail on the Saint-Quentin plateau passes through a former military training zone and ends at the now abandoned military forts, providing a vantage point from which to survey the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAlthough the steel industry has historically dominated Moselle's economy, Metz's efforts at economic diversification have created a base in the sectors of commerce, tourism, information technology and the automotive industry. The city is the economic heart of the Lorraine region and around 73,000 people work daily within the urban agglomeration. The transport facilities found in the conurbation, including the international high-speed railway, motorway, inland connections and the local bus rapid transit system, have made the city a transport hub in the heart of the European Union. Metz is home to the biggest harbour handling cereals in France with over 4,000,000 tons/year.Metz is home to the Moselle Chamber of Commerce. International companies such as PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, ArcelorMittal, SFR, and TDF have established plants and centres in the Metz conurbation. Metz is also the regional headquarters of the Caisse d'Epargne and Banque Populaire banking groups.\nMetz is an important commercial centre of northern France with France's biggest retailer federation, consisting of around 2,000 retailers. Important retail companies are found in the city, such as the Galeries Lafayette, the Printemps department store and the Fnac entertainment retail chain. The historic city centre displays one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France and a mall, the Saint-Jacques centre. In addition there are several multiplex movie theatres and malls found in the urban agglomeration.\nIn recent years, Metz municipality have promoted an ambitious policy of tourism development, including urban revitalization and refurbishment of buildings and public squares. This policy has been spurred by the creation of the Centre Pompidou-Metz in 2010. Since its inauguration, the institution has become the most popular cultural venue in France outside Paris, with 550,000 visitors per year. Meanwhile, Saint-Stephen Cathedral is the most visited building in the city, accommodating 652,000 visitors per year.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums and exhibition halls ===\n\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz is a museum of modern and contemporary arts, the largest temporary exhibition area in France outside Paris. The museum features exhibitions from the extensive collection of the Centre Pompidou, Europe's largest collection of 20th-century art.\nSaint Stephen's Cathedral is the Gothic cathedral of the city built during the 13th century. The cathedral exhibits the collection of the Bishopric of Metz, including paraments and items used in the service of the Eucharist. Metz Cathedral is sometimes nicknamed the Good Lord's Lantern (French: la Lanterne du Bon Dieu), as it has the largest expanse of stained glass windows in the world: 6,500 m2 (70,000 sq ft). These include works by Gothic and Renaissance master glass makers Hermann von M\u00fcnster, Th\u00e9obald of Lixheim, and Valentin Bousch, romantic Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, tachist Roger Bissi\u00e8re, cubist Jacques Villon and modernist Marc Chagall.\nAnother of the city's churches displays a complete set of stained glass windows by French modernist Jean Cocteau.In addition, Metz features other museums and exhibition venues, such as:\n\nThe FRAC Lorraine, a public collection of contemporary art of the Lorraine region. It is located in the 12th-century Saint-Liver H\u00f4tel and organizes exhibitions of local and international contemporary artists.\nThe Golden Courtyard (French: la Cour d'Or), a museum dedicated to the history of Metz, divided into four sections (e.g. archeology, medieval, architecture, and fine arts). The Golden Courtyard displays a rich collection of Gallo-Roman and medieval finds and the remains of the Gallo-Roman baths of Divodurum Mediomatricum, revealed by the extension works to the museums in the 1930s.\nThe Museum of the 1870 War and of the Annexion in Gravelotte, a village located within the Metz-Metropole conurbation and the site of the Battle of Gravelotte, the only museum in Europe dedicated to the Franco-Prussian War. The museum exhibits military and everyday items from the period as well as artworks related to the 1870 war. A mausoleum erected in 1904 honoring the soldiers who died during the battle, the Memorial Hall (French: La Halle du Souvenir), has been included in the museum.\nThe House for Europe, located on the estate of Robert Schuman in Scy-Chazelles in the Metz-Metropole conurbation, transformed into a museum and convention centre. Across the street is the fortified 12th Century church where Robert Schuman now rests. The Robert Schuman House for Europe organises cultural and educational events that introduce the visitor to Schuman's life and works and to the way Europe has been constructed and continues to develop today.\nVerlaine's House (French: la Maison de Verlaine) is a museum located in the house where the poet Paul Verlaine was born, dedicated to his work, featuring permanent and temporary exhibitions. The Solange Bertrand foundation, located in the artist's former house, conserves and displays her artworks. The municipal archives preserve and exhibit Metz's historical municipal records dating from medieval times to the present.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\nMetz has several venues for the performing arts. The Opera House of Metz, the oldest working opera house in France, features plays, dance, and lyric poetry. The Arsenal Concert Hall, dedicated to art music, is widely renowned for its excellent acoustics. The Trinitarians Club is a multi-media arts complex housed in the vaulted cellar and chapel of an ancient convent, the city's prime venue for jazz music.

For instance, Gregorian chant was created in Metz during the 8th century as a fusion of Gallican and ancient Roman repertory. Then called Messin Chant, it remains the oldest form of music still in use in Western Europe. The bishops of Metz, notably Saint-Chrodegang promoted its use for the Roman liturgy in Gallic lands under the favorable influence of the Carolingian monarchs. Messin chant made two major contributions to the body of chant: it fitted the chant into the ancient Greek octoechos system, and invented an innovative musical notation, using neumes to show the shape of a remembered melody. Metz was also an important centre of illumination of Carolingian manuscripts, producing such monuments of Carolingian book illumination as the Drogo Sacramentary.The Metz School (French: \u00c9cole de Metz) was an art movement in Metz and the region between 1834 and 1870, centred on Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal. The term was originally proposed in 1845 by the poet Charles Baudelaire, who appreciated the works of the artists. They were influenced by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix and inspired by the medieval heritage of Metz and its romantic surroundings. The Franco-Prussian War and the annexation of the territory by the Germans resulted in the dismantling of the movement. The main figures of the Metz School were Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, Auguste Migette, Auguste Hussenot, Louis-Th\u00e9odore Devilly, Christopher Fratin, and Charles P\u00eatre. Their works include paintings, engravings, drawings, stained-glass windows, and sculptures.\nA festival named \"passages\" takes place in May. Numerous shows are presented to it.\n\n\n=== The Graoully dragon as symbol of the city ===\n\nThe Graoully is depicted as a fearsome dragon, vanquished by the sacred powers of Saint Clement of Metz, the first Bishop of the city. The Graoully quickly became a symbol of Metz and can be seen in numerous insignia of the city, from the 10th century on. Writers from Metz tend to present the legend as an allegory of Christianity's victory over paganism, represented by the harmful dragon.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nLocal specialties include the quiche, the pot\u00e9e, the Lorrain p\u00e2t\u00e9, and also suckling pig. Different recipes, such as jam, tart, charcuterie and fruit brandy, are made from the Mirabelle and Damson plums. Also, Metz is the cradle of some pastries like the Metz cheese pie and the Metz Balls (French: boulet de Metz), a ganache-stuffed biscuit coated with marzipan, caramel, and dark chocolate. Local beverages include Moselle wine and Amos beer.The Covered Market of Metz is one of the oldest, most grandiose in France and is home to traditional local food producers and retailers. Originally built as the bishop's palace, the French Revolution broke out before the Bishop of Metz could move in and the citizens decided to turn it into a food market. The adjacent Chamber's Square (French: Place de la Chambre) is surrounded by numerous local food restaurants.\n\n\n=== Celebrations and events ===\nMany events are celebrated in Metz throughout the year. The city of Metz dedicates two weeks to the Mirabelle plum during the popular Mirabelle Festival held in August. During the festival, in addition to open markets selling fresh plums, mirabelle tarts, and mirabelle liquor, there are live music, fireworks, parties, art exhibits, a parade with floral floats, a competition, the crowning of the Mirabelle Queen and a gala of celebration.A literature festival is held in June. The Montgolfiades hot air balloon festival is organized in September. The second most popular Christmas Market in France is held in November and December. Finally, a Saint Nicholas parade honors the patron saint of the Lorraine region in December.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nMetz is home to the Football Club of Metz (FC Metz), a football association club in Ligue 1, the highest division of French football (as of 2019\u20132020 season).

The University of Lorraine, which ranks in 2016 among the top 15 of French universities and among the top 300 of universities in the world according to the 2016 Academic Ranking of World Universities, \n has a student body of over 55,000 and offers 101 accredited research centers organized in 9 research areas and 8 doctoral colleges.\n\n\n=== Graduate schools ===\nAt the end of the 1990s, the city expanded and the Metz Science Park was created in the southern area. Along with this expansion, several graduate schools took the opportunity to establish campuses in the park. At first, facilities were grouped around the lake Symphony, like Sup\u00e9lec in 1985 and Georgia Tech Lorraine in 1990. In 1996, the engineering school Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech (ENSAM) built a research and learning center next to the golf course. This opened the way to the development of a new area, where the Franco-German university (ISFATES) and the ENIM moved in 2010. These graduate schools often cooperate with the University of Lorraine. For instance, the university and ENSAM share research teams, laboratories, equipments, and doctoral programs.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\nPublic transport includes a bus rapid transit system, called Mettis. Mettis vehicles are high-capacity hybrid bi-articulated buses built by Van Hool, and stop at designated elevated tubes, complete with disability access.

        "wiki": "Metz ( METS, French: [m\u025bs] (listen), Lorraine Franconian: [m\u025bts]) Latin: Divodurum Mediomatricorum is a city in northeast France located at the confluence of the Moselle and the Seille rivers. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle department and the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region. Located near the tripoint along the junction of France, Germany, and Luxembourg, the city forms a central place of the European Greater Region and the SaarLorLux euroregion.Metz has a rich 3,000-year-history, having variously been a Celtic oppidum, an important Gallo-Roman city, the Merovingian capital of Austrasia, the birthplace of the Carolingian dynasty, a cradle of the Gregorian chant, and one of the oldest republics in Europe. The city has been steeped in Romance culture, but has been strongly influenced by Germanic culture due to its location and history.Because of its historical, cultural, and architectural background, Metz has been submitted on France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. The city features noteworthy buildings such as the Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral with its largest expanse of stained-glass windows in the world, the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains being the oldest church in France, its Imperial Station Palace displaying the apartment of the German Kaiser, or its Opera House, the oldest one working in France. Metz is home to some world-class venues including the Arsenal Concert Hall and the Centre Pompidou-Metz museum.\nA basin of urban ecology, Metz gained its nickname of The Green City (French: La Ville Verte), as it has extensive open grounds and public gardens. The historic city centre is one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France.A historic garrison town, Metz is the economic heart of the Lorraine region, specialising in information technology and automotive industries. Metz is home to the University of Lorraine, Georgia Tech Lorraine, and a centre for applied research and development in the materials sector, notably in metallurgy and metallography, the heritage of the Lorraine region's past in the iron and steel industry.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn ancient times, the town was known as \"city of Mediomatrici\", being inhabited by the tribe of the same name. After its integration into the Roman Empire, the city was called Divodurum Mediomatricum, meaning Holy Village or Holy Fortress of the Mediomatrici, then it was known as Mediomatrix. During the 5th century AD, the name evolved to \"Mettis\", which gave rise to Metz.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMetz has a recorded history dating back over 2,000 years. Before the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar in 52 BC, it was the oppidum of the Celtic Mediomatrici tribe. Integrated into the Roman Empire, Metz became quickly one of the principal towns of Gaul with a population of 40,000, until the barbarian depredations and its transfer to the Franks about the end of the 5th century. Between the 6th and 8th centuries, the city was the residence of the Merovingian kings of Austrasia. After the Treaty of Verdun in 843, Metz became the capital of the Kingdom of Lotharingia and was ultimately integrated into the Holy Roman Empire, being granted semi-independent status. During the 12th century, Metz became a republic and the Republic of Metz stood until the 15th century.With the signature of the Treaty of Chambord in 1552, Metz passed to the hands of the Kings of France. As the German Protestant Princes who traded Metz (alongside Toul and Verdun) for the promise of French military assistance, had no authority to cede territory of the Holy Roman Empire, the change of jurisdiction wasn't recognised by the Holy Roman Empire until the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. Under French rule, Metz was selected as capital of the Three Bishoprics and became a strategic fortified town. With creation of the departments by the Estates-General of 1789, Metz was chosen as capital of the Department of Moselle. Although French-speaking, after the Franco-Prussian War and according to the Treaty of Frankfurt of 1871, the city was annexed into the German Empire, being part of the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine and serving as capital of the Bezirk Lothringen.Metz remained German until the end of World War I, when it reverted to France. However, after the Battle of France during the Second World War, the city was annexed once more by the German Third Reich. In 1944, the attack on the city by the U.S. Third Army freed the city from German rule and Metz reverted one more time to France after World War II.During the 1950s, Metz was chosen to be the capital of the newly created Lorraine region. With the creation of the European Community and the later European Union, the city has become central to the Greater Region and the SaarLorLux Euroregion.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMetz is located on the banks of the Moselle and the Seille rivers, 43 km (26.7 mi) from the Schengen tripoint where the borders of France, Germany, and Luxembourg meet. The city was built in a place where many branches of the Moselle river creates several islands, which are encompassed within the urban planning.The terrain of Metz forms part of the Paris Basin and presents a plateau relief cut by river valleys presenting cuestas in the north\u2013south direction. Metz and its surrounding countryside are included in the forest and crop Lorraine Regional Natural Park, covering a total area of 205,000 ha (506,566.0 acres).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of Lorraine is a semi-continental climate. The summers are warm and humid, sometimes stormy, and the warmest month of the year is July, when daytime temperatures average approximately 25 \u00b0C (77.0 \u00b0F). The winters are cold and snowy with temperature dropping to an average low of \u22120.5 \u00b0C (31.1 \u00b0F) in January. Lows can be much colder through the night and early morning and the snowy period extends from November to February.The length of the day varies significantly over the course of the year. The shortest day is 21 December with 7:30 hours of sunlight; the longest day is 20 June with 16:30 hours of sunlight. The median cloud cover is 93% and does not vary substantially over the course of the year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nThe inhabitants of Metz are called Messin(e)s. Statistics on the ethnic and religious make up of the population of Metz are haphazard, as the French Republic prohibits making distinctions between citizens regarding race, beliefs, and political and philosophic opinions in the process of census taking. This would otherwise document the city to be a Germanic locale, as is the rest of the province and the neighboring Alsace.The French national census of 2012 estimated the population of Metz to be 119,551, while the population of Metz urban agglomeration was about 389,851. Through history, Metz's population has been impacted by the vicissitudes of the wars and annexations involving the city, which have prevented continuous population growth. More recently, the city has suffered from the restructuring of the military and the metallurgy industry. The historical population for the current area of Metz municipality is as follows:\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\nSeveral well-known figures have been linked to the city of Metz throughout its history. Renowned Messins include poet Paul Verlaine, composer Ambroise Thomas, and mathematician Jean-Victor Poncelet; numerous well-known German figures were also born in Metz notably during the annexation periods. Moreover, the city has been the residence of people such as writer Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Cardinal Mazarin, political thinker Alexis de Tocqueville, French patriot and American Revolutionary War hero Marquis Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette, and Luxembourg-born German-French statesman Robert Schuman.\n\n\n== Law and government ==\n\n\n=== Local law ===\n\nThe Local Law (French: droit local) applied in Metz is a legal system that operates in parallel with French law. Created in 1919, it preserves the French laws applied in France before 1870 and maintained by the Germans during the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, but repealed in the rest of France after 1871. It also maintains German laws enacted by the German Empire between 1871 and 1918, specific provisions adopted by the local authorities, and French laws that have been enacted after 1919 to be applicable only in Alsace-Lorraine. This specific local legislation encompasses different areas including religion, social work and finance.\nThe most striking of the legal differences between France and Alsace-Lorraine is the absence in Alsace-Lorraine of strict secularism, even though a constitutional right of freedom of religion is guaranteed by the French government. Alsace-Lorraine is still governed by a pre-1905 law established by the Concordat of 1801, which provides for the public subsidy of the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches and the Jewish religion.\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\nLike every commune of the present French Republic, Metz is managed by a mayor (French: maire) and a municipal council (French: conseil municipal), democratically elected by two-round proportional voting for six years. The mayor is assisted by 54 municipal councillors, and the municipal council is held on the last Thursday of every month. Since 2008, the mayor of Metz has been socialist Dominique Gros.The city belongs to the Metz Metropole union of cities, which includes the 40 cities of the Metz urban agglomeration. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle based in the former Intendant Palace. In addition, Metz is the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region, hosted in the former Saint-Clement Abbey.\n\n\n=== City administrative divisions ===\n\nThe city of Metz is divided into 14 administrative divisions:\n\n\n== Cityscape and environmental policy ==\n\nMetz contains a mishmash of architectural layers, bearing witness to centuries of history at the crossroads of different cultures, and features a number of architectural landmarks. The city possesses one of the largest Urban Conservation Areas in France, and more than 100 of the city's buildings are classified on the Monument Historique list. Because of its historical and cultural background, Metz is designated as French Town of Art and History, and has been submitted on to France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List.The city is famous for its yellow limestone architecture, a result of the extensive use of Jaumont stone. The historic district has kept part of the Gallo-Roman city with Divodurum's Cardo Maximus, then called Via Scarponensis (today the Trinitaires, Taison, and Serpenoise streets), and the Decumanus Maximus (today En Fournirue and d'Estr\u00e9es streets). At the Cardo and Decumanus intersection was situated the Roman forum, today the Saint-Jacques Square.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nFrom its Gallo-Roman past, the city preserves vestiges of the thermae (in the basement of the Golden Courtyard museum), parts of the aqueduct, and the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains.Saint Louis' square with its vaulted arcades and a Knights Templar chapel remains a major symbol of the city's High Medieval heritage. The Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral, several churches and H\u00f4tels, and two remarkable municipal granaries reflect the Late Middle Ages. Examples of Renaissance architecture can be seen in H\u00f4tels from the 16th century, such as the House of Heads (French: Maison des T\u00eates).The city hall and the buildings surrounding the town square are by French architect Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Blondel, who was awarded the task of redesigning and modernizing the centre of Metz by the Royal Academy of Architecture in 1755 the context of the Enlightenment. Neoclassical buildings from the 18th century, such as the Opera House, the Intendant Palace (the present-day prefecture), and the Royal Governor's Palace (the present-day courthouse) built by Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau, are also found in the city.The Imperial District was built during the first annexation of Metz by the German Empire. In order to \"germanise\" the city, Emperor Wilhelm II decided to create a new district shaped by a distinctive blend of Germanic architecture, including Renaissance, neo-Romanesque and neo-Classical, mixed with elements of Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Alsatian and mock-Bavarian styles. Instead of Jaumont stone, commonly used everywhere else in the city, stone used in the Rhineland, such as pink and grey sandstone, granite and basalt were used. The district features noteworthy buildings including the rail station and the Central Post Office by German architect J\u00fcrgen Kr\u00f6ger.Modern architecture can also be seen in the town with works of French architects Roger-Henri Expert (Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-de-l'Enfant-J\u00e9sus church, 1934), Georges-Henri Pingusson (Fire Station, 1960), and Jean Dubuisson (subdivisions, 1960s). The refurbishment of the former Ney Arsenal as a Concert Hall in 1989 and the erection of the Metz Arena in 2002, by Spanish and French architects Ricardo Bofill and French Paul Chemetov represent the Postmodern movement.The Centre Pompidou-Metz museum in the Amphitheatre District represents a strong architectural initiative to mark the entrance of Metz into the 21st century. Designed by Japanese architect Shigeru Ban, the building is remarkable for the complex, innovative carpentry of its roof, and integrates concepts of sustainable architecture. The project encompasses the architecture of two recipients of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, Shigeru Ban (2014) and French Christian de Portzamparc (1994). The Amphitheatre District is also conceived by French architects Nicolas Michelin, Jean-Paul Viguier, and Jean-Michel Wilmotte and designer Philippe Starck. The urban project is expected to be completed by 2023. Further, a contemporary music venue designed by contextualist French architect Rudy Ricciotti stands in the Borny District.\n\n\n=== Urban ecology ===\n\nUnder the leadership of such people as botanist Jean-Marie Pelt, Metz pioneered a policy of urban ecology during the early 1970s. Because of the failure of post-war urban planning and housing estate development in Europe during the 1960s, mostly based on the concepts of CIAM, Jean-Marie Pelt, then municipal councillor of Metz, initiated a new approach to the urban environment.Based initially on the ideas of the Chicago School, Pelt's theories pleaded for better integration of humans into their environment and developed a concept centered on the relationship between \"stone and water\". His policy was realized in Metz by the establishment of extensive open areas surrounding the Moselle and the Seille rivers and the development of large pedestrian areas. As a result, Metz has over 37 m2 (400 sq ft) of open areas per inhabitant in the form of numerous public gardens in the city.The principles of urban ecology are still applied in Metz with the implementation of a local Agenda 21 action plan. The municipal ecological policy encompasses the sustainable refurbishment of ancient buildings, the erection of sustainable districts and buildings, green public transport, and the creation of public gardens by means of landscape architecture.Additionally, the city has developed its own combined heat and power station, using waste wood biomass from the surrounding forests as a renewable energy source. With a thermal efficiency above 80%, the 45MW boiler of the plant provides electricity and heat for 44,000 dwellings. The Metz power station is the first local producer and distributor of energy in France.\n\n\n=== Military architecture ===\n\nAs a historic Garrison town, Metz has been heavily influenced by military architecture throughout its history. From ancient history to the present, the city has been successively fortified and modified to accommodate the troops stationed there. Defensive walls from classical antiquity to the 20th century are still visible today, incorporated into the design of public gardens along the Moselle and Seille rivers. A medieval bridge castle from the 13th century, named Germans' Gate (French: Porte des Allemands), today converted into a convention and exhibition centre, has become one of the landmarks of the city. It is still possible to see parts of the 16th century citadel, as well as fortifications built in the 1740s by Louis de Cormontaigne but based on designs by Vauban. Important barracks, mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries, are spread around the city: some, which are of architectural interest, have been converted to civilian use, such as the Arsenal Concert Hall by Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill.\nThe extensive fortifications of Metz, which ring the city, include early examples of S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res system forts. Other forts were incorporated into the Maginot Line. A hiking trail on the Saint-Quentin plateau passes through a former military training zone and ends at the now abandoned military forts, providing a vantage point from which to survey the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAlthough the steel industry has historically dominated Moselle's economy, Metz's efforts at economic diversification have created a base in the sectors of commerce, tourism, information technology and the automotive industry. The city is the economic heart of the Lorraine region and around 73,000 people work daily within the urban agglomeration. The transport facilities found in the conurbation, including the international high-speed railway, motorway, inland connections and the local bus rapid transit system, have made the city a transport hub in the heart of the European Union. Metz is home to the biggest harbour handling cereals in France with over 4,000,000 tons/year.Metz is home to the Moselle Chamber of Commerce. International companies such as PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, ArcelorMittal, SFR, and TDF have established plants and centres in the Metz conurbation. Metz is also the regional headquarters of the Caisse d'Epargne and Banque Populaire banking groups.\nMetz is an important commercial centre of northern France with France's biggest retailer federation, consisting of around 2,000 retailers. Important retail companies are found in the city, such as the Galeries Lafayette, the Printemps department store and the Fnac entertainment retail chain. The historic city centre displays one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France and a mall, the Saint-Jacques centre. In addition there are several multiplex movie theatres and malls found in the urban agglomeration.\nIn recent years, Metz municipality have promoted an ambitious policy of tourism development, including urban revitalization and refurbishment of buildings and public squares. This policy has been spurred by the creation of the Centre Pompidou-Metz in 2010. Since its inauguration, the institution has become the most popular cultural venue in France outside Paris, with 550,000 visitors per year. Meanwhile, Saint-Stephen Cathedral is the most visited building in the city, accommodating 652,000 visitors per year.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums and exhibition halls ===\n\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz is a museum of modern and contemporary arts, the largest temporary exhibition area in France outside Paris. The museum features exhibitions from the extensive collection of the Centre Pompidou, Europe's largest collection of 20th-century art.\nSaint Stephen's Cathedral is the Gothic cathedral of the city built during the 13th century. The cathedral exhibits the collection of the Bishopric of Metz, including paraments and items used in the service of the Eucharist. Metz Cathedral is sometimes nicknamed the Good Lord's Lantern (French: la Lanterne du Bon Dieu), as it has the largest expanse of stained glass windows in the world: 6,500 m2 (70,000 sq ft). These include works by Gothic and Renaissance master glass makers Hermann von M\u00fcnster, Th\u00e9obald of Lixheim, and Valentin Bousch, romantic Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, tachist Roger Bissi\u00e8re, cubist Jacques Villon and modernist Marc Chagall.\nAnother of the city's churches displays a complete set of stained glass windows by French modernist Jean Cocteau.In addition, Metz features other museums and exhibition venues, such as:\n\nThe FRAC Lorraine, a public collection of contemporary art of the Lorraine region. It is located in the 12th-century Saint-Liver H\u00f4tel and organizes exhibitions of local and international contemporary artists.\nThe Golden Courtyard (French: la Cour d'Or), a museum dedicated to the history of Metz, divided into four sections (e.g. archeology, medieval, architecture, and fine arts). The Golden Courtyard displays a rich collection of Gallo-Roman and medieval finds and the remains of the Gallo-Roman baths of Divodurum Mediomatricum, revealed by the extension works to the museums in the 1930s.\nThe Museum of the 1870 War and of the Annexion in Gravelotte, a village located within the Metz-Metropole conurbation and the site of the Battle of Gravelotte, the only museum in Europe dedicated to the Franco-Prussian War. The museum exhibits military and everyday items from the period as well as artworks related to the 1870 war. A mausoleum erected in 1904 honoring the soldiers who died during the battle, the Memorial Hall (French: La Halle du Souvenir), has been included in the museum.\nThe House for Europe, located on the estate of Robert Schuman in Scy-Chazelles in the Metz-Metropole conurbation, transformed into a museum and convention centre. Across the street is the fortified 12th Century church where Robert Schuman now rests. The Robert Schuman House for Europe organises cultural and educational events that introduce the visitor to Schuman's life and works and to the way Europe has been constructed and continues to develop today.\nVerlaine's House (French: la Maison de Verlaine) is a museum located in the house where the poet Paul Verlaine was born, dedicated to his work, featuring permanent and temporary exhibitions. The Solange Bertrand foundation, located in the artist's former house, conserves and displays her artworks. The municipal archives preserve and exhibit Metz's historical municipal records dating from medieval times to the present.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\nMetz has several venues for the performing arts. The Opera House of Metz, the oldest working opera house in France, features plays, dance, and lyric poetry. The Arsenal Concert Hall, dedicated to art music, is widely renowned for its excellent acoustics. The Trinitarians Club is a multi-media arts complex housed in the vaulted cellar and chapel of an ancient convent, the city's prime venue for jazz music. The Music Box (French: Boite \u00e0 Musique), familiarly known as BAM, is the concert venue dedicated to rock and electronic music. The Braun Hall and the Kolt\u00e8s Theater feature plays, and the city has two movie theaters specializing in Auteur cinema. The Saint-Jacques Square, surrounded by busy bars and pubs whose open-air tables fill the centre of the square.\nSince 2014, the former bus garage has been converted to accommodate over thirty artists in residence, in a space where they can create and rehearse artworks and even build set decorations. The artistic complex, called Metz Network of All Cultures (French: Toutes les Cultures en R\u00e9seau \u00e0 Metz) and familiarly known as TCRM-Blida, encompasses a large hall of 3,000 m2 (32,000 sq ft) while theater and dance companies benefit from a studio of 800 m2 (8,600 sq ft) with backstages.\n\n\n=== Metz in the arts ===\nMetz was an important cultural centre during the Carolingian Renaissance. For instance, Gregorian chant was created in Metz during the 8th century as a fusion of Gallican and ancient Roman repertory. Then called Messin Chant, it remains the oldest form of music still in use in Western Europe. The bishops of Metz, notably Saint-Chrodegang promoted its use for the Roman liturgy in Gallic lands under the favorable influence of the Carolingian monarchs. Messin chant made two major contributions to the body of chant: it fitted the chant into the ancient Greek octoechos system, and invented an innovative musical notation, using neumes to show the shape of a remembered melody. Metz was also an important centre of illumination of Carolingian manuscripts, producing such monuments of Carolingian book illumination as the Drogo Sacramentary.The Metz School (French: \u00c9cole de Metz) was an art movement in Metz and the region between 1834 and 1870, centred on Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal. The term was originally proposed in 1845 by the poet Charles Baudelaire, who appreciated the works of the artists. They were influenced by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix and inspired by the medieval heritage of Metz and its romantic surroundings. The Franco-Prussian War and the annexation of the territory by the Germans resulted in the dismantling of the movement. The main figures of the Metz School were Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, Auguste Migette, Auguste Hussenot, Louis-Th\u00e9odore Devilly, Christopher Fratin, and Charles P\u00eatre. Their works include paintings, engravings, drawings, stained-glass windows, and sculptures.\nA festival named \"passages\" takes place in May. Numerous shows are presented to it.\n\n\n=== The Graoully dragon as symbol of the city ===\n\nThe Graoully is depicted as a fearsome dragon, vanquished by the sacred powers of Saint Clement of Metz, the first Bishop of the city. The Graoully quickly became a symbol of Metz and can be seen in numerous insignia of the city, from the 10th century on. Writers from Metz tend to present the legend as an allegory of Christianity's victory over paganism, represented by the harmful dragon.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nLocal specialties include the quiche, the pot\u00e9e, the Lorrain p\u00e2t\u00e9, and also suckling pig. Different recipes, such as jam, tart, charcuterie and fruit brandy, are made from the Mirabelle and Damson plums. Also, Metz is the cradle of some pastries like the Metz cheese pie and the Metz Balls (French: boulet de Metz), a ganache-stuffed biscuit coated with marzipan, caramel, and dark chocolate. Local beverages include Moselle wine and Amos beer.The Covered Market of Metz is one of the oldest, most grandiose in France and is home to traditional local food producers and retailers. Originally built as the bishop's palace, the French Revolution broke out before the Bishop of Metz could move in and the citizens decided to turn it into a food market. The adjacent Chamber's Square (French: Place de la Chambre) is surrounded by numerous local food restaurants.\n\n\n=== Celebrations and events ===\nMany events are celebrated in Metz throughout the year. The city of Metz dedicates two weeks to the Mirabelle plum during the popular Mirabelle Festival held in August. During the festival, in addition to open markets selling fresh plums, mirabelle tarts, and mirabelle liquor, there are live music, fireworks, parties, art exhibits, a parade with floral floats, a competition, the crowning of the Mirabelle Queen and a gala of celebration.A literature festival is held in June. The Montgolfiades hot air balloon festival is organized in September. The second most popular Christmas Market in France is held in November and December. Finally, a Saint Nicholas parade honors the patron saint of the Lorraine region in December.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nMetz is home to the Football Club of Metz (FC Metz), a football association club in Ligue 1, the highest division of French football (as of 2019\u20132020 season). FC Metz has won three times the Ligue 2 (1935, 2007, and 2014), twice the Coupe de France (in 1984 and 1988) and the French League Cup (in 1986 and 1996), and was French championship runner-up in 1998. FC Metz has also gained recognition in France and Europe for its successful youth academy, winning the Gambardella Cup 3 times in 1981, 2001, and 2010. The Saint-Symphorien stadium has been the home of FC Metz since the creation of the club.\nMetz Handball is a Handball club. Metz Handball has won the French Women's First League championship 23 times, the Women's France Cup nine times, and the French Women's League Cup eight times. The Metz Arena has been the home of Metz Handball since 2002.\nSince 2003, Metz has been home to the Moselle Open, an ATP World Tour 250 tournament played on indoor hard courts, which usually takes place in September.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== High schools ===\nMetz has numerous high schools, including the Fabert High School and the Lyc\u00e9e of Communication. Some of these institutions offer higher education programs such as classes pr\u00e9paratoires (undergraduate school) or BTS (technician certificate).\n\n\n=== University of Lorraine ===\n\nMetz is also home to the University of Lorraine (often abbreviated as UdL).  \nThe university is divided into two university centers, one in Metz (material sciences, technology, and management) and one in Nancy (biological sciences, health care, administration, and management). The University of Lorraine, which ranks in 2016 among the top 15 of French universities and among the top 300 of universities in the world according to the 2016 Academic Ranking of World Universities, \n has a student body of over 55,000 and offers 101 accredited research centers organized in 9 research areas and 8 doctoral colleges.\n\n\n=== Graduate schools ===\nAt the end of the 1990s, the city expanded and the Metz Science Park was created in the southern area. Along with this expansion, several graduate schools took the opportunity to establish campuses in the park. At first, facilities were grouped around the lake Symphony, like Sup\u00e9lec in 1985 and Georgia Tech Lorraine in 1990. In 1996, the engineering school Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech (ENSAM) built a research and learning center next to the golf course. This opened the way to the development of a new area, where the Franco-German university (ISFATES) and the ENIM moved in 2010. These graduate schools often cooperate with the University of Lorraine. For instance, the university and ENSAM share research teams, laboratories, equipments, and doctoral programs.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\nPublic transport includes a bus rapid transit system, called Mettis. Mettis vehicles are high-capacity hybrid bi-articulated buses built by Van Hool, and stop at designated elevated tubes, complete with disability access. Mettis has its own planned and integrated transportation system, which includes two dedicated lines that spread out into the Metz conurbation. Mettis lanes A and B serve the city's major facilities (e.g., city centre, university campus, and hospitals), and a transport hub is located next to the railway station.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nMetz Railway Station is connected to the French high speed train (TGV) network, which provides a direct rail service to Paris and Luxembourg. The time from Paris (Gare de l'Est) to Metz is 82 minutes. Additionally, Metz is served by the Lorraine TGV railway station, located at Louvigny, 25 km (16 mi) to the south of Metz, for high speed trains going to Nantes, Rennes, Lille and Bordeaux (without stopping in Paris). Also, Metz is one of the main stations of the regional express trains system, M\u00e9trolor.\n\n\n=== Motorways ===\nMetz is located at the intersection of two major road axes: the Eastern Motorway, itself a part of the European route E50 connecting Paris to Prague, and the A31 Motorway, which goes north to Luxembourg and south to the Mediterranean Sea towards Nancy, Dijon, and Lyon.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nThe Luxembourg International Airport is the nearest international airport, connected to Metz by M\u00e9trolor train. The Lorraine TGV Station is 75 minutes by train from France international Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport. Finally, Metz-Nancy-Lorraine Airport is located in Goin, 16.5 km (10.25 mi) southeast of Metz..\n\n\n=== Waterways ===\n\nMetz is located at the confluence of the Moselle and the Seille rivers, both navigable waterways. The marina connects Metz to the cities of the Moselle valley (i.e. Trier, Schengen, and Koblenz) via the Moselle river.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Religious heritage ===\nthe Gothic Saint Stephen's cathedral built during the 13th century.

        "wiki": "A power station, also referred to as a power plant and sometimes generating station or generating plant, is an industrial facility for the generation of electric power. Power stations are generally connected to an electrical grid.\nMany power stations contain one or more generators, a rotating machine that converts mechanical power into three-phase electric power. The relative motion between a magnetic field and a conductor creates an electric current.\nThe energy source harnessed to turn the generator varies widely. Most power stations in the world burn fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas to generate electricity. Clean energy sources include nuclear power, and an increasing use of renewables such as solar, wind, wave, geothermal, and hydroelectric.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the early 1871s Belgian inventor Z\u00e9nobe Gramme invented a generator powerful enough to produce power on a commercial scale for industry.In 1878, a hydroelectric power station was designed and built by William, Lord Armstrong at Cragside, England. It used water from lakes on his estate to power Siemens dynamos. The electricity supplied power to lights, heating, produced hot water, ran an elevator as well as labor-saving devices and farm buildings.In the autumn of 1881, a central station providing public power was built in Godalming, England. It was proposed after the town failed to reach an agreement on the rate charged by the gas company, so the town council decided to use electricity. It used hydroelectric power for street lighting and household lighting. The system was not a commercial success and the town reverted to gas.In 1882 the world's first coal-fired public power station, the Edison Electric Light Station, was built in London, a project of Thomas Edison organized by Edward Johnson. A Babcock & Wilcox boiler powered a 93 kW (125 horsepower) steam engine that drove a 27 tonnes (27 long tons) generator. This supplied electricity to premises in the area that could be reached through the culverts of the viaduct without digging up the road, which was the monopoly of the gas companies. The customers included the City Temple and the Old Bailey. Another important customer was the Telegraph Office of the General Post Office, but this could not be reached through the culverts. Johnson arranged for the supply cable to be run overhead, via Holborn Tavern and Newgate.In September 1882 in New York, the Pearl Street Station was established by Edison to provide electric lighting in the lower Manhattan Island area. The station ran until destroyed by fire in 1890. The station used reciprocating steam engines to turn direct-current generators. Because of the DC distribution, the service area was small, limited by voltage drop in the feeders. In 1886 George Westinghouse began building an alternating current system that used a transformer to step up voltage for long-distance transmission and then stepped it back down for indoor lighting, a more efficient and less expensive system which is similar to modern systems. The war of the currents eventually resolved in favor of AC distribution and utilization, although some DC systems persisted to the end of the 20th century. DC systems with a service radius of a mile (kilometer) or so were necessarily smaller, less efficient of fuel consumption, and more labor-intensive to operate than much larger central AC generating stations.\n\nAC systems used a wide range of frequencies depending on the type of load; lighting load using higher frequencies, and traction systems and heavy motor load systems preferring lower frequencies. The economics of central station generation improved greatly when unified light and power systems, operating at a common frequency, were developed. The same generating plant that fed large industrial loads during the day, could feed commuter railway systems during rush hour and then serve lighting load in the evening, thus improving the system load factor and reducing the cost of electrical energy overall. Many exceptions existed, generating stations were dedicated to power or light by the choice of frequency, and rotating frequency changers and rotating converters were particularly common to feed electric railway systems from the general lighting and power network.\nThroughout the first few decades of the 20th century central stations became larger, using higher steam pressures to provide greater efficiency, and relying on interconnections of multiple generating stations to improve reliability and cost. High-voltage AC transmission allowed hydroelectric power to be conveniently moved from distant waterfalls to city markets. The advent of the steam turbine in central station service, around 1906, allowed great expansion of generating capacity. Generators were no longer limited by the power transmission of belts or the relatively slow speed of reciprocating engines, and could grow to enormous sizes. For example, Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti planned what would have been the largest reciprocating steam engine ever built for a proposed new central station, but scrapped the plans when turbines became available in the necessary size. Building power systems out of central stations required combinations of engineering skill and financial acumen in equal measure. Pioneers of central station generation include George Westinghouse and Samuel Insull in the United States, Ferranti and Charles Hesterman Merz in UK, and many others.\n\n\n== Thermal power stations ==\n\nIn thermal power stations, mechanical power is produced by a heat engine that transforms thermal energy, often from combustion of a fuel, into rotational energy. Most thermal power stations produce steam, so they are sometimes called steam power stations. Not all thermal energy can be transformed into mechanical power, according to the second law of thermodynamics; therefore, there is always heat lost to the environment. If this loss is employed as useful heat, for industrial processes or district heating, the power plant is referred to as a cogeneration power plant or CHP (combined heat-and-power) plant. In countries where district heating is common, there are dedicated heat plants called heat-only boiler stations. An important class of power stations in the Middle East uses by-product heat for the desalination of water.\nThe efficiency of a thermal power cycle is limited by the maximum working fluid temperature produced. The efficiency is not directly a function of the fuel used. For the same steam conditions, coal-, nuclear- and gas power plants all have the same theoretical efficiency. Overall, if a system is on constantly (base load) it will be more efficient than one that is used intermittently (peak load). Steam turbines generally operate at higher efficiency when operated at full capacity.\nBesides use of reject heat for process or district heating, one way to improve overall efficiency of a power plant is to combine two different thermodynamic cycles in a combined cycle plant. Most commonly, exhaust gases from a gas turbine are used to generate steam for a boiler and a steam turbine. The combination of a \"top\" cycle and a \"bottom\" cycle produces higher overall efficiency than either cycle can attain alone.\n\n\n=== Classification ===\n\n\n==== By heat source ====\nFossil-fuel power stations may also use a steam turbine generator or in the case of natural gas-fired plants may use a combustion turbine. A coal-fired power station produces heat by burning coal in a steam boiler. The steam drives a steam turbine and generator that then produces electricity. The waste products of combustion include ash, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon dioxide. Some of the gases can be removed from the waste stream to reduce pollution.\nNuclear power plants use the heat generated in a nuclear reactor's core (by the fission process) to create steam which then operates a steam turbine and generator. About 20 percent of electric generation in the USA is produced by nuclear power plants.\nGeothermal power plants use steam extracted from hot underground rocks. These rocks are heated by the decay of radioactive material in the Earth's crust.\nBiomass-fuelled power plants may be fuelled by waste from sugar cane, municipal solid waste, landfill methane, or other forms of biomass.\nIn integrated steel mills, blast furnace exhaust gas is a low-cost, although low-energy-density, fuel.\nWaste heat from industrial processes is occasionally concentrated enough to use for power generation, usually in a steam boiler and turbine.\nSolar thermal electric plants use sunlight to boil water and produce steam which turns the generator.\n\n\n==== By prime mover ====\nSteam turbine plants use the dynamic pressure generated by expanding steam to turn the blades of a turbine. Almost all large non-hydro plants use this system. About 90 percent of all electric power produced in the world is through use of steam turbines.\nGas turbine plants use the dynamic pressure from flowing gases (air and combustion products) to directly operate the turbine. Natural-gas fuelled (and oil fueled) combustion turbine plants can start rapidly and so are used to supply \"peak\" energy during periods of high demand, though at higher cost than base-loaded plants. These may be comparatively small units, and sometimes completely unmanned, being remotely operated. This type was pioneered by the UK, Princetown being the world's first, commissioned in 1959.\nCombined cycle plants have both a gas turbine fired by natural gas, and a steam boiler and steam turbine which use the hot exhaust gas from the gas turbine to produce electricity. This greatly increases the overall efficiency of the plant, and many new baseload power plants are combined cycle plants fired by natural gas.\nInternal combustion reciprocating engines are used to provide power for isolated communities and are frequently used for small cogeneration plants. Hospitals, office buildings, industrial plants, and other critical facilities also use them to provide backup power in case of a power outage. These are usually fuelled by diesel oil, heavy oil, natural gas, and landfill gas.\nMicroturbines, Stirling engine and internal combustion reciprocating engines are low-cost solutions for using opportunity fuels, such as landfill gas, digester gas from water treatment plants and waste gas from oil production.\n\n\n==== By duty ====\nPower plants that can be dispatched (scheduled) to provide energy to a system include:\n\nBase load power plants run nearly continually to provide that component of system load that doesn't vary during a day or week. Baseload plants can be highly optimized for low fuel cost, but may not start or stop quickly during changes in system load. Examples of base-load plants would include large modern coal-fired and nuclear generating stations, or hydro plants with a predictable supply of water.\nPeaking power plants meet the daily peak load, which may only be for one or two hours each day. While their incremental operating cost is always higher than base load plants, they are required to ensure security of the system during load peaks. Peaking plants include simple cycle gas turbines and reciprocating internal combustion engines, which can be started up rapidly when system peaks are predicted. Hydroelectric plants may also be designed for peaking use.\nLoad following power plants can economically follow the variations in the daily and weekly load, at lower cost than peaking plants and with more flexibility than baseload plants.Non-dispatchable plants include such sources as wind and solar energy; while their long-term contribution to system energy supply is predictable, on a short-term (daily or hourly) base their energy must be used as available since generation cannot be deferred. Contractual arrangements (\"take or pay\") with independent power producers or system interconnections to other networks may be effectively non-dispatchable.\n\n\n=== Cooling towers ===\n\nAll thermal power plants produce waste heat energy as a byproduct of the useful electrical energy produced. The amount of waste heat energy equals or exceeds the amount of energy converted into useful electricity. Gas-fired power plants can achieve as much as 65 percent conversion efficiency, while coal and oil plants achieve around 30 to 49 percent. The waste heat produces a temperature rise in the atmosphere, which is small compared to that produced by greenhouse-gas emissions from the same power plant. Natural draft wet cooling towers at many nuclear power plants and large fossil fuel-fired power plants use large hyperboloid chimney-like structures (as seen in the image at the right) that release the waste heat to the ambient atmosphere by the evaporation of water.\nHowever, the mechanical induced-draft or forced-draft wet cooling towers in many large thermal power plants, nuclear power plants, fossil-fired power plants, petroleum refineries, petrochemical plants, geothermal, biomass and waste-to-energy plants use fans to provide air movement upward through downcoming water, and are not hyperboloid chimney-like structures. The induced or forced-draft cooling towers are typically rectangular, box-like structures filled with a material that enhances the mixing of the upflowing air and the downflowing water.In areas with restricted water use, a dry cooling tower or directly air-cooled radiators may be necessary, since the cost or environmental consequences of obtaining make-up water for evaporative cooling would be prohibitive. These coolers have lower efficiency and higher energy consumption to drive fans, compared to a typical wet, evaporative cooling tower.\n\n\n=== Once-through cooling systems ===\nElectric companies often prefer to use cooling water from the ocean, a lake, or a river, or a cooling pond, instead of a cooling tower. This single pass or once-through cooling system can save the cost of a cooling tower and may have lower energy costs for pumping cooling water through the plant's heat exchangers. However, the waste heat can cause thermal pollution as the water is discharged. Power plants using natural bodies of water for cooling are designed with mechanisms such as fish screens, to limit intake of organisms into the cooling machinery. These screens are only partially effective and as a result billions of fish and other aquatic organisms are killed by power plants each year. For example, the cooling system at the Indian Point Energy Center in New York kills over a billion fish eggs and larvae annually.A further environmental impact is that aquatic organisms which adapt to the warmer discharge water may be injured if the plant shuts down in cold weather.\nWater consumption by power stations is a developing issue.In recent years, recycled wastewater, or grey water, has been used in cooling towers. The Calpine Riverside and the Calpine Fox power stations in Wisconsin as well as the Calpine Mankato power station in Minnesota are among these facilities.\n\n\n== Power from renewable energy ==\nPower stations can generate electrical energy from renewable energy sources.\n\n\n=== Hydroelectric power station ===\n\nIn a hydroelectric power station water flows through turbines using hydropower to generate hydroelectricity. Power is captured from the gravitational force of water falling through penstocks to water turbines connected to generators. The amount of power available is a combination of height and flow. A wide range of Dams may be built to raise the water level, and create a lake for storing water.\nHydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use.\n\n\n=== Solar ===\n\nSolar energy can be turned into electricity either directly in solar cells, or in a concentrating solar power plant by focusing the light to run a heat engine. A solar photovoltaic power plant converts sunlight into direct current electricity using the photoelectric effect. Inverters change the direct current into alternating current for connection to the electrical grid. This type of plant does not use rotating machines for energy conversion. Solar thermal power plants use either parabolic troughs or heliostats to direct sunlight onto a pipe containing a heat transfer fluid, such as oil. The heated oil is then used to boil water into steam, which turns a turbine that drives an electrical generator. The central tower type of solar thermal power plant uses hundreds or thousands of mirrors, depending on size, to direct sunlight onto a receiver on top of a tower. The heat is used to produce steam to turn turbines that drive electrical generators.\n\n\n=== Wind ===\n\nWind turbines can be used to generate electricity in areas with strong, steady winds, sometimes offshore. Many different designs have been used in the past, but almost all modern turbines being produced today use a three-bladed, upwind design. Grid-connected wind turbines now being built are much larger than the units installed during the 1970s. They thus produce power more cheaply and reliably than earlier models.  With larger turbines (on the order of one megawatt), the blades move more slowly than older, smaller, units, which makes them less visually distracting and safer for birds. \n\n\n=== Marine ===\n\nMarine energy or marine power (also sometimes referred to as ocean energy or ocean power) refers to the energy carried by ocean waves, tides, salinity, and ocean temperature differences. The movement of water in the world's oceans creates a vast store of kinetic energy, or energy in motion. This energy can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes, transport and industries.\nThe term marine energy encompasses both wave power \u2014 power from surface waves, and tidal power \u2014 obtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water. Offshore wind power is not a form of marine energy, as wind power is derived from the wind, even if the wind turbines are placed over water.\nThe oceans have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations. Ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new renewable energy around the world.\n\n\n=== Osmosis ===\n\nSalinity gradient energy is called pressure-retarded osmosis. In this method, seawater is pumped into a pressure chamber that is at a pressure lower than the difference between the pressures of saline water and fresh water. Freshwater is also pumped into the pressure chamber through a membrane, which increases both the volume and pressure of the chamber. As the pressure differences are compensated, a turbine is spun creating energy. This method is being specifically studied by the Norwegian utility Statkraft, which has calculated that up to 25 TWh/yr would be available from this process in Norway. Statkraft has built the world's first prototype osmotic power plant on the Oslo fjord which was opened on 24 November 2009. In January 2014 however Statkraft announced not to continue this pilot.\n\n\n=== Biomass ===\n\nBiomass energy can be produced from combustion of waste green material to heat water into steam and drive a steam turbine. Bioenergy can also be processed through a range of temperatures and pressures in gasification, pyrolysis or torrefaction reactions. Depending on the desired end product, these reactions create more energy-dense products (syngas, wood pellets, biocoal) that can then be fed into an accompanying engine to produce electricity at a much lower emission rate when compared with open burning.\n\n\n== Storage power stations ==\n\nIt is possible to store energy and produce the electricity at a later time like in Pumped-storage hydroelectricity, Thermal energy storage, Flywheel energy storage, Battery storage power station and so on.\n\n\n=== Pumped storage ===\n\nThe world's largest form of storage for excess electricity, pumped-storage is a reversible hydroelectric plant. They are a net consumer of energy but provide storage for any source of electricity, effectively smoothing peaks and troughs in electricity supply and demand. Pumped storage plants typically use \"spare\" electricity during off peak periods to pump water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir. Because the pumping takes place \"off peak\", electricity is less valuable than at peak times. This less valuable \"spare\" electricity comes from uncontrolled wind power and base load power plants such as coal, nuclear and geothermal, which still produce power at night even though demand is very low. During daytime peak demand, when electricity prices are high, the storage is used for peaking power, where water in the upper reservoir is allowed to flow back to a lower reservoir through a turbine and generator. Unlike coal power stations, which can take more than 12 hours to start up from cold, a hydroelectric generator can be brought into service in a few minutes, ideal to meet a peak load demand. Two substantial pumped storage schemes are in South Africa, Palmiet Pumped Storage Scheme and another in the Drakensberg, Ingula Pumped Storage Scheme.\n\n\n== Typical power output ==\n\nThe power generated by a power station is measured in multiples of the watt, typically megawatts (106 watts) or gigawatts (109 watts). Power stations vary greatly in capacity depending on the type of power plant and on historical, geographical and economic factors. The following examples offer a sense of the scale.\nMany of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in the USA. As of 2011, the Roscoe Wind Farm is the second largest onshore wind farm in the world, producing 781.5 MW of power, followed by the Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center (735.5 MW). As of July 2013, the London Array in United Kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 630 MW, followed by Thanet Offshore Wind Project in United Kingdom at 300 MW.\nAs of 2015, the largest photovoltaic (PV) power plants in the world are led by Longyangxia Dam Solar Park in China, rated at 850 megawatts.\nSolar thermal power stations in the U.S. have the following output:\n\nThe country's largest solar facility at Kramer Junction has an output of 354 MW\nThe Blythe Solar Power Project planned production is estimated at 485 MW\nLarge coal-fired, nuclear, and hydroelectric power stations can generate hundreds of megawatts to multiple gigawatts. Some examples:\n\nThe Koeberg Nuclear Power Station in South Africa has a rated capacity of 1860 megawatts.\nThe coal-fired Ratcliffe-on-Soar Power Station in the UK has a rated capacity of 2 gigawatts.\nThe Aswan Dam hydro-electric plant in Egypt has a capacity of 2.1 gigawatts.\nThe Three Gorges Dam hydro-electric plant in China has a capacity of 22.5 gigawatts.Gas turbine power plants can generate tens to hundreds of megawatts. Some examples:\n\nThe Indian Queens simple-cycle, or open cycle gas turbine (OCGT), peaking power station in Cornwall UK, with a single gas turbine is rated 140 megawatts.\nThe Medway Power Station, a combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power station in Kent, UK with two gas turbines and one steam turbine, is rated 700 megawatts.The rated capacity of a power station is nearly the maximum electrical power that the power station can produce.\nSome power plants are run at almost exactly their rated capacity all the time, as a non-load-following base load power plant, except at times of scheduled or unscheduled maintenance.\nHowever, many power plants usually produce much less power than their rated capacity.\nIn some cases a power plant produces much less power than its rated capacity because it uses an intermittent energy source.\nOperators try to pull maximum available power from such power plants, because their marginal cost is practically zero, but the available power varies widely\u2014in particular, it may be zero during heavy storms at night.\nIn some cases operators deliberately produce less power for economic reasons.\nThe cost of fuel to run a load following power plant may be relatively high, and the cost of fuel to run a peaking power plant is even higher\u2014they have relatively high marginal costs.\nOperators keep power plants turned off (\"operational reserve\") or running at minimum fuel consumption (\"spinning reserve\") most of the time.\nOperators feed more fuel into load following power plants only when the demand rises above what lower-cost plants (i.e., intermittent and base load plants) can produce, and then feed more fuel into peaking power plants only when the demand rises faster than the load following power plants can follow.\n\n\n== Operations ==\n\nOperating staff at a power station have several duties. Operators are responsible for the safety of the work crews that frequently do repairs on the mechanical and electrical equipment. They maintain the equipment with periodic inspections and log temperatures, pressures and other important information at regular intervals. Operators are responsible for starting and stopping the generators depending on need. They are able to synchronize and adjust the voltage output of the added generation with the running electrical system, without upsetting the system. They must know the electrical and mechanical systems to troubleshoot problems in the facility and add to the reliability of the facility. Operators must be able to respond to an emergency and know the procedures in place to deal with it.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIdentification System for Power Stations (KKS)\nPower station diagram\nLargest Power Plants in the World\nDatabase of carbon emissions of power plants worldwide (Carbon Monitoring For Action: CARMA)",

        "wiki": "Metz ( METS, French: [m\u025bs] (listen), Lorraine Franconian: [m\u025bts]) Latin: Divodurum Mediomatricorum is a city in northeast France located at the confluence of the Moselle and the Seille rivers. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle department and the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region. Located near the tripoint along the junction of France, Germany, and Luxembourg, the city forms a central place of the European Greater Region and the SaarLorLux euroregion.Metz has a rich 3,000-year-history, having variously been a Celtic oppidum, an important Gallo-Roman city, the Merovingian capital of Austrasia, the birthplace of the Carolingian dynasty, a cradle of the Gregorian chant, and one of the oldest republics in Europe. The city has been steeped in Romance culture, but has been strongly influenced by Germanic culture due to its location and history.Because of its historical, cultural, and architectural background, Metz has been submitted on France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. The city features noteworthy buildings such as the Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral with its largest expanse of stained-glass windows in the world, the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains being the oldest church in France, its Imperial Station Palace displaying the apartment of the German Kaiser, or its Opera House, the oldest one working in France. Metz is home to some world-class venues including the Arsenal Concert Hall and the Centre Pompidou-Metz museum.\nA basin of urban ecology, Metz gained its nickname of The Green City (French: La Ville Verte), as it has extensive open grounds and public gardens. The historic city centre is one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France.A historic garrison town, Metz is the economic heart of the Lorraine region, specialising in information technology and automotive industries. Metz is home to the University of Lorraine, Georgia Tech Lorraine, and a centre for applied research and development in the materials sector, notably in metallurgy and metallography, the heritage of the Lorraine region's past in the iron and steel industry.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn ancient times, the town was known as \"city of Mediomatrici\", being inhabited by the tribe of the same name. After its integration into the Roman Empire, the city was called Divodurum Mediomatricum, meaning Holy Village or Holy Fortress of the Mediomatrici, then it was known as Mediomatrix. During the 5th century AD, the name evolved to \"Mettis\", which gave rise to Metz.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMetz has a recorded history dating back over 2,000 years. Before the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar in 52 BC, it was the oppidum of the Celtic Mediomatrici tribe. Integrated into the Roman Empire, Metz became quickly one of the principal towns of Gaul with a population of 40,000, until the barbarian depredations and its transfer to the Franks about the end of the 5th century. Between the 6th and 8th centuries, the city was the residence of the Merovingian kings of Austrasia. After the Treaty of Verdun in 843, Metz became the capital of the Kingdom of Lotharingia and was ultimately integrated into the Holy Roman Empire, being granted semi-independent status. During the 12th century, Metz became a republic and the Republic of Metz stood until the 15th century.With the signature of the Treaty of Chambord in 1552, Metz passed to the hands of the Kings of France. As the German Protestant Princes who traded Metz (alongside Toul and Verdun) for the promise of French military assistance, had no authority to cede territory of the Holy Roman Empire, the change of jurisdiction wasn't recognised by the Holy Roman Empire until the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. Under French rule, Metz was selected as capital of the Three Bishoprics and became a strategic fortified town. With creation of the departments by the Estates-General of 1789, Metz was chosen as capital of the Department of Moselle. Although French-speaking, after the Franco-Prussian War and according to the Treaty of Frankfurt of 1871, the city was annexed into the German Empire, being part of the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine and serving as capital of the Bezirk Lothringen.Metz remained German until the end of World War I, when it reverted to France. However, after the Battle of France during the Second World War, the city was annexed once more by the German Third Reich. In 1944, the attack on the city by the U.S. Third Army freed the city from German rule and Metz reverted one more time to France after World War II.During the 1950s, Metz was chosen to be the capital of the newly created Lorraine region. With the creation of the European Community and the later European Union, the city has become central to the Greater Region and the SaarLorLux Euroregion.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMetz is located on the banks of the Moselle and the Seille rivers, 43 km (26.7 mi) from the Schengen tripoint where the borders of France, Germany, and Luxembourg meet. The city was built in a place where many branches of the Moselle river creates several islands, which are encompassed within the urban planning.The terrain of Metz forms part of the Paris Basin and presents a plateau relief cut by river valleys presenting cuestas in the north\u2013south direction. Metz and its surrounding countryside are included in the forest and crop Lorraine Regional Natural Park, covering a total area of 205,000 ha (506,566.0 acres).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of Lorraine is a semi-continental climate. The summers are warm and humid, sometimes stormy, and the warmest month of the year is July, when daytime temperatures average approximately 25 \u00b0C (77.0 \u00b0F). The winters are cold and snowy with temperature dropping to an average low of \u22120.5 \u00b0C (31.1 \u00b0F) in January. Lows can be much colder through the night and early morning and the snowy period extends from November to February.The length of the day varies significantly over the course of the year. The shortest day is 21 December with 7:30 hours of sunlight; the longest day is 20 June with 16:30 hours of sunlight. The median cloud cover is 93% and does not vary substantially over the course of the year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nThe inhabitants of Metz are called Messin(e)s. Statistics on the ethnic and religious make up of the population of Metz are haphazard, as the French Republic prohibits making distinctions between citizens regarding race, beliefs, and political and philosophic opinions in the process of census taking. This would otherwise document the city to be a Germanic locale, as is the rest of the province and the neighboring Alsace.The French national census of 2012 estimated the population of Metz to be 119,551, while the population of Metz urban agglomeration was about 389,851. Through history, Metz's population has been impacted by the vicissitudes of the wars and annexations involving the city, which have prevented continuous population growth. More recently, the city has suffered from the restructuring of the military and the metallurgy industry. The historical population for the current area of Metz municipality is as follows:\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\nSeveral well-known figures have been linked to the city of Metz throughout its history. Renowned Messins include poet Paul Verlaine, composer Ambroise Thomas, and mathematician Jean-Victor Poncelet; numerous well-known German figures were also born in Metz notably during the annexation periods. Moreover, the city has been the residence of people such as writer Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Cardinal Mazarin, political thinker Alexis de Tocqueville, French patriot and American Revolutionary War hero Marquis Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette, and Luxembourg-born German-French statesman Robert Schuman.\n\n\n== Law and government ==\n\n\n=== Local law ===\n\nThe Local Law (French: droit local) applied in Metz is a legal system that operates in parallel with French law. Created in 1919, it preserves the French laws applied in France before 1870 and maintained by the Germans during the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, but repealed in the rest of France after 1871. It also maintains German laws enacted by the German Empire between 1871 and 1918, specific provisions adopted by the local authorities, and French laws that have been enacted after 1919 to be applicable only in Alsace-Lorraine. This specific local legislation encompasses different areas including religion, social work and finance.\nThe most striking of the legal differences between France and Alsace-Lorraine is the absence in Alsace-Lorraine of strict secularism, even though a constitutional right of freedom of religion is guaranteed by the French government. Alsace-Lorraine is still governed by a pre-1905 law established by the Concordat of 1801, which provides for the public subsidy of the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches and the Jewish religion.\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\nLike every commune of the present French Republic, Metz is managed by a mayor (French: maire) and a municipal council (French: conseil municipal), democratically elected by two-round proportional voting for six years. The mayor is assisted by 54 municipal councillors, and the municipal council is held on the last Thursday of every month. Since 2008, the mayor of Metz has been socialist Dominique Gros.The city belongs to the Metz Metropole union of cities, which includes the 40 cities of the Metz urban agglomeration. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle based in the former Intendant Palace. In addition, Metz is the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region, hosted in the former Saint-Clement Abbey.\n\n\n=== City administrative divisions ===\n\nThe city of Metz is divided into 14 administrative divisions:\n\n\n== Cityscape and environmental policy ==\n\nMetz contains a mishmash of architectural layers, bearing witness to centuries of history at the crossroads of different cultures, and features a number of architectural landmarks. The city possesses one of the largest Urban Conservation Areas in France, and more than 100 of the city's buildings are classified on the Monument Historique list. Because of its historical and cultural background, Metz is designated as French Town of Art and History, and has been submitted on to France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List.The city is famous for its yellow limestone architecture, a result of the extensive use of Jaumont stone. The historic district has kept part of the Gallo-Roman city with Divodurum's Cardo Maximus, then called Via Scarponensis (today the Trinitaires, Taison, and Serpenoise streets), and the Decumanus Maximus (today En Fournirue and d'Estr\u00e9es streets). At the Cardo and Decumanus intersection was situated the Roman forum, today the Saint-Jacques Square.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nFrom its Gallo-Roman past, the city preserves vestiges of the thermae (in the basement of the Golden Courtyard museum), parts of the aqueduct, and the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains.Saint Louis' square with its vaulted arcades and a Knights Templar chapel remains a major symbol of the city's High Medieval heritage. The Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral, several churches and H\u00f4tels, and two remarkable municipal granaries reflect the Late Middle Ages. Examples of Renaissance architecture can be seen in H\u00f4tels from the 16th century, such as the House of Heads (French: Maison des T\u00eates).The city hall and the buildings surrounding the town square are by French architect Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Blondel, who was awarded the task of redesigning and modernizing the centre of Metz by the Royal Academy of Architecture in 1755 the context of the Enlightenment. Neoclassical buildings from the 18th century, such as the Opera House, the Intendant Palace (the present-day prefecture), and the Royal Governor's Palace (the present-day courthouse) built by Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau, are also found in the city.The Imperial District was built during the first annexation of Metz by the German Empire. In order to \"germanise\" the city, Emperor Wilhelm II decided to create a new district shaped by a distinctive blend of Germanic architecture, including Renaissance, neo-Romanesque and neo-Classical, mixed with elements of Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Alsatian and mock-Bavarian styles. Instead of Jaumont stone, commonly used everywhere else in the city, stone used in the Rhineland, such as pink and grey sandstone, granite and basalt were used. The district features noteworthy buildings including the rail station and the Central Post Office by German architect J\u00fcrgen Kr\u00f6ger.Modern architecture can also be seen in the town with works of French architects Roger-Henri Expert (Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-de-l'Enfant-J\u00e9sus church, 1934), Georges-Henri Pingusson (Fire Station, 1960), and Jean Dubuisson (subdivisions, 1960s). The refurbishment of the former Ney Arsenal as a Concert Hall in 1989 and the erection of the Metz Arena in 2002, by Spanish and French architects Ricardo Bofill and French Paul Chemetov represent the Postmodern movement.The Centre Pompidou-Metz museum in the Amphitheatre District represents a strong architectural initiative to mark the entrance of Metz into the 21st century. Designed by Japanese architect Shigeru Ban, the building is remarkable for the complex, innovative carpentry of its roof, and integrates concepts of sustainable architecture. The project encompasses the architecture of two recipients of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, Shigeru Ban (2014) and French Christian de Portzamparc (1994). The Amphitheatre District is also conceived by French architects Nicolas Michelin, Jean-Paul Viguier, and Jean-Michel Wilmotte and designer Philippe Starck. The urban project is expected to be completed by 2023. Further, a contemporary music venue designed by contextualist French architect Rudy Ricciotti stands in the Borny District.\n\n\n=== Urban ecology ===\n\nUnder the leadership of such people as botanist Jean-Marie Pelt, Metz pioneered a policy of urban ecology during the early 1970s. Because of the failure of post-war urban planning and housing estate development in Europe during the 1960s, mostly based on the concepts of CIAM, Jean-Marie Pelt, then municipal councillor of Metz, initiated a new approach to the urban environment.Based initially on the ideas of the Chicago School, Pelt's theories pleaded for better integration of humans into their environment and developed a concept centered on the relationship between \"stone and water\". His policy was realized in Metz by the establishment of extensive open areas surrounding the Moselle and the Seille rivers and the development of large pedestrian areas. As a result, Metz has over 37 m2 (400 sq ft) of open areas per inhabitant in the form of numerous public gardens in the city.The principles of urban ecology are still applied in Metz with the implementation of a local Agenda 21 action plan. The municipal ecological policy encompasses the sustainable refurbishment of ancient buildings, the erection of sustainable districts and buildings, green public transport, and the creation of public gardens by means of landscape architecture.Additionally, the city has developed its own combined heat and power station, using waste wood biomass from the surrounding forests as a renewable energy source. With a thermal efficiency above 80%, the 45MW boiler of the plant provides electricity and heat for 44,000 dwellings. The Metz power station is the first local producer and distributor of energy in France.\n\n\n=== Military architecture ===\n\nAs a historic Garrison town, Metz has been heavily influenced by military architecture throughout its history. From ancient history to the present, the city has been successively fortified and modified to accommodate the troops stationed there. Defensive walls from classical antiquity to the 20th century are still visible today, incorporated into the design of public gardens along the Moselle and Seille rivers. A medieval bridge castle from the 13th century, named Germans' Gate (French: Porte des Allemands), today converted into a convention and exhibition centre, has become one of the landmarks of the city. It is still possible to see parts of the 16th century citadel, as well as fortifications built in the 1740s by Louis de Cormontaigne but based on designs by Vauban. Important barracks, mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries, are spread around the city: some, which are of architectural interest, have been converted to civilian use, such as the Arsenal Concert Hall by Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill.\nThe extensive fortifications of Metz, which ring the city, include early examples of S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res system forts. Other forts were incorporated into the Maginot Line. A hiking trail on the Saint-Quentin plateau passes through a former military training zone and ends at the now abandoned military forts, providing a vantage point from which to survey the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAlthough the steel industry has historically dominated Moselle's economy, Metz's efforts at economic diversification have created a base in the sectors of commerce, tourism, information technology and the automotive industry. The city is the economic heart of the Lorraine region and around 73,000 people work daily within the urban agglomeration. The transport facilities found in the conurbation, including the international high-speed railway, motorway, inland connections and the local bus rapid transit system, have made the city a transport hub in the heart of the European Union. Metz is home to the biggest harbour handling cereals in France with over 4,000,000 tons/year.Metz is home to the Moselle Chamber of Commerce. International companies such as PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, ArcelorMittal, SFR, and TDF have established plants and centres in the Metz conurbation. Metz is also the regional headquarters of the Caisse d'Epargne and Banque Populaire banking groups.\nMetz is an important commercial centre of northern France with France's biggest retailer federation, consisting of around 2,000 retailers. Important retail companies are found in the city, such as the Galeries Lafayette, the Printemps department store and the Fnac entertainment retail chain. The historic city centre displays one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France and a mall, the Saint-Jacques centre. In addition there are several multiplex movie theatres and malls found in the urban agglomeration.\nIn recent years, Metz municipality have promoted an ambitious policy of tourism development, including urban revitalization and refurbishment of buildings and public squares. This policy has been spurred by the creation of the Centre Pompidou-Metz in 2010. Since its inauguration, the institution has become the most popular cultural venue in France outside Paris, with 550,000 visitors per year. Meanwhile, Saint-Stephen Cathedral is the most visited building in the city, accommodating 652,000 visitors per year.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums and exhibition halls ===\n\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz is a museum of modern and contemporary arts, the largest temporary exhibition area in France outside Paris.

The cathedral exhibits the collection of the Bishopric of Metz, including paraments and items used in the service of the Eucharist. Metz Cathedral is sometimes nicknamed the Good Lord's Lantern (French: la Lanterne du Bon Dieu), as it has the largest expanse of stained glass windows in the world: 6,500 m2 (70,000 sq ft). These include works by Gothic and Renaissance master glass makers Hermann von M\u00fcnster, Th\u00e9obald of Lixheim, and Valentin Bousch, romantic Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, tachist Roger Bissi\u00e8re, cubist Jacques Villon and modernist Marc Chagall.\nAnother of the city's churches displays a complete set of stained glass windows by French modernist Jean Cocteau.In addition, Metz features other museums and exhibition venues, such as:\n\nThe FRAC Lorraine, a public collection of contemporary art of the Lorraine region.

For instance, Gregorian chant was created in Metz during the 8th century as a fusion of Gallican and ancient Roman repertory. Then called Messin Chant, it remains the oldest form of music still in use in Western Europe. The bishops of Metz, notably Saint-Chrodegang promoted its use for the Roman liturgy in Gallic lands under the favorable influence of the Carolingian monarchs. Messin chant made two major contributions to the body of chant: it fitted the chant into the ancient Greek octoechos system, and invented an innovative musical notation, using neumes to show the shape of a remembered melody. Metz was also an important centre of illumination of Carolingian manuscripts, producing such monuments of Carolingian book illumination as the Drogo Sacramentary.The Metz School (French: \u00c9cole de Metz) was an art movement in Metz and the region between 1834 and 1870, centred on Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal. The term was originally proposed in 1845 by the poet Charles Baudelaire, who appreciated the works of the artists. They were influenced by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix and inspired by the medieval heritage of Metz and its romantic surroundings. The Franco-Prussian War and the annexation of the territory by the Germans resulted in the dismantling of the movement. The main figures of the Metz School were Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, Auguste Migette, Auguste Hussenot, Louis-Th\u00e9odore Devilly, Christopher Fratin, and Charles P\u00eatre. Their works include paintings, engravings, drawings, stained-glass windows, and sculptures.\nA festival named \"passages\" takes place in May. Numerous shows are presented to it.\n\n\n=== The Graoully dragon as symbol of the city ===\n\nThe Graoully is depicted as a fearsome dragon, vanquished by the sacred powers of Saint Clement of Metz, the first Bishop of the city. The Graoully quickly became a symbol of Metz and can be seen in numerous insignia of the city, from the 10th century on. Writers from Metz tend to present the legend as an allegory of Christianity's victory over paganism, represented by the harmful dragon.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nLocal specialties include the quiche, the pot\u00e9e, the Lorrain p\u00e2t\u00e9, and also suckling pig. Different recipes, such as jam, tart, charcuterie and fruit brandy, are made from the Mirabelle and Damson plums. Also, Metz is the cradle of some pastries like the Metz cheese pie and the Metz Balls (French: boulet de Metz), a ganache-stuffed biscuit coated with marzipan, caramel, and dark chocolate. Local beverages include Moselle wine and Amos beer.The Covered Market of Metz is one of the oldest, most grandiose in France and is home to traditional local food producers and retailers. Originally built as the bishop's palace, the French Revolution broke out before the Bishop of Metz could move in and the citizens decided to turn it into a food market. The adjacent Chamber's Square (French: Place de la Chambre) is surrounded by numerous local food restaurants.\n\n\n=== Celebrations and events ===\nMany events are celebrated in Metz throughout the year. The city of Metz dedicates two weeks to the Mirabelle plum during the popular Mirabelle Festival held in August.

Along with this expansion, several graduate schools took the opportunity to establish campuses in the park. At first, facilities were grouped around the lake Symphony, like Sup\u00e9lec in 1985 and Georgia Tech Lorraine in 1990. In 1996, the engineering school Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech (ENSAM) built a research and learning center next to the golf course. This opened the way to the development of a new area, where the Franco-German university (ISFATES) and the ENIM moved in 2010. These graduate schools often cooperate with the University of Lorraine. For instance, the university and ENSAM share research teams, laboratories, equipments, and doctoral programs.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\nPublic transport includes a bus rapid transit system, called Mettis.

        "wiki": "The Jardin botanique de Metz, also known as the Jardin botanique de la Ville de Metz, is a 4.4-hectare (11-acre) botanical garden located at 27 ter, rue du Pont-\u00e0-Mousson, Montigny-l\u00e8s-Metz, Moselle, Grand Est, France. It is open daily; admission is free.\nThe garden was originally known as Frescatelly Park, an estate of Philippe d'Aubertin of Bionville, whose summer pavilion (built 1719) currently houses the directorate of the Department of Parks. It was purchased by the city of Metz in 1866 and landscaped primarily in the English style by city architect Demoget. Its greenhouses were originally built on the city's esplanade in 1861, during the World Fair, and moved to the Botanical Garden in 1880.\nToday the garden contains a rose garden (80 varieties), fragrance garden, collection of grasses, flower beds, and a mature arboretum with Aesculus flava, bald cypress, Diospyros virginiana, Fagus sylvatica asplenifolia, ginkgo, Melia azedarach, sequoia (140 years old), and Sophora japonica, as well as a large stand of hardy bamboo (Phyllostachys aurea). Its 1,000 m2 (11,000 sq ft) greenhouses contain about 4,500 plants representing 80 botanical families, including orchids, cacti, and palms.\nThe garden contains three ponds, winding paths, a bronze statue of an eagle (1866) by Metz animalier Christopher Fratin, and a toy train railway that circles through the site.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of botanical gardens in France\n\n\n== References ==\nCapmetz57 blog (photographs)\nChibislife blog (photographs)\nParcs et Jardins entry (French)\nConservatoire des Jardins et Paysages entry (French)\n1001 Fleurs entry (French)\nJe Decouvre La France entry (French)",

        "wiki": "Metz ( METS, French: [m\u025bs] (listen), Lorraine Franconian: [m\u025bts]) Latin: Divodurum Mediomatricorum is a city in northeast France located at the confluence of the Moselle and the Seille rivers. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle department and the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region. Located near the tripoint along the junction of France, Germany, and Luxembourg, the city forms a central place of the European Greater Region and the SaarLorLux euroregion.Metz has a rich 3,000-year-history, having variously been a Celtic oppidum, an important Gallo-Roman city, the Merovingian capital of Austrasia, the birthplace of the Carolingian dynasty, a cradle of the Gregorian chant, and one of the oldest republics in Europe. The city has been steeped in Romance culture, but has been strongly influenced by Germanic culture due to its location and history.Because of its historical, cultural, and architectural background, Metz has been submitted on France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. The city features noteworthy buildings such as the Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral with its largest expanse of stained-glass windows in the world, the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains being the oldest church in France, its Imperial Station Palace displaying the apartment of the German Kaiser, or its Opera House, the oldest one working in France. Metz is home to some world-class venues including the Arsenal Concert Hall and the Centre Pompidou-Metz museum.\nA basin of urban ecology, Metz gained its nickname of The Green City (French: La Ville Verte), as it has extensive open grounds and public gardens. The historic city centre is one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France.A historic garrison town, Metz is the economic heart of the Lorraine region, specialising in information technology and automotive industries. Metz is home to the University of Lorraine, Georgia Tech Lorraine, and a centre for applied research and development in the materials sector, notably in metallurgy and metallography, the heritage of the Lorraine region's past in the iron and steel industry.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn ancient times, the town was known as \"city of Mediomatrici\", being inhabited by the tribe of the same name. After its integration into the Roman Empire, the city was called Divodurum Mediomatricum, meaning Holy Village or Holy Fortress of the Mediomatrici, then it was known as Mediomatrix. During the 5th century AD, the name evolved to \"Mettis\", which gave rise to Metz.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMetz has a recorded history dating back over 2,000 years. Before the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar in 52 BC, it was the oppidum of the Celtic Mediomatrici tribe. Integrated into the Roman Empire, Metz became quickly one of the principal towns of Gaul with a population of 40,000, until the barbarian depredations and its transfer to the Franks about the end of the 5th century. Between the 6th and 8th centuries, the city was the residence of the Merovingian kings of Austrasia. After the Treaty of Verdun in 843, Metz became the capital of the Kingdom of Lotharingia and was ultimately integrated into the Holy Roman Empire, being granted semi-independent status. During the 12th century, Metz became a republic and the Republic of Metz stood until the 15th century.With the signature of the Treaty of Chambord in 1552, Metz passed to the hands of the Kings of France. As the German Protestant Princes who traded Metz (alongside Toul and Verdun) for the promise of French military assistance, had no authority to cede territory of the Holy Roman Empire, the change of jurisdiction wasn't recognised by the Holy Roman Empire until the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. Under French rule, Metz was selected as capital of the Three Bishoprics and became a strategic fortified town. With creation of the departments by the Estates-General of 1789, Metz was chosen as capital of the Department of Moselle. Although French-speaking, after the Franco-Prussian War and according to the Treaty of Frankfurt of 1871, the city was annexed into the German Empire, being part of the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine and serving as capital of the Bezirk Lothringen.Metz remained German until the end of World War I, when it reverted to France. However, after the Battle of France during the Second World War, the city was annexed once more by the German Third Reich. In 1944, the attack on the city by the U.S. Third Army freed the city from German rule and Metz reverted one more time to France after World War II.During the 1950s, Metz was chosen to be the capital of the newly created Lorraine region. With the creation of the European Community and the later European Union, the city has become central to the Greater Region and the SaarLorLux Euroregion.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMetz is located on the banks of the Moselle and the Seille rivers, 43 km (26.7 mi) from the Schengen tripoint where the borders of France, Germany, and Luxembourg meet. The city was built in a place where many branches of the Moselle river creates several islands, which are encompassed within the urban planning.The terrain of Metz forms part of the Paris Basin and presents a plateau relief cut by river valleys presenting cuestas in the north\u2013south direction. Metz and its surrounding countryside are included in the forest and crop Lorraine Regional Natural Park, covering a total area of 205,000 ha (506,566.0 acres).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of Lorraine is a semi-continental climate. The summers are warm and humid, sometimes stormy, and the warmest month of the year is July, when daytime temperatures average approximately 25 \u00b0C (77.0 \u00b0F). The winters are cold and snowy with temperature dropping to an average low of \u22120.5 \u00b0C (31.1 \u00b0F) in January. Lows can be much colder through the night and early morning and the snowy period extends from November to February.The length of the day varies significantly over the course of the year. The shortest day is 21 December with 7:30 hours of sunlight; the longest day is 20 June with 16:30 hours of sunlight. The median cloud cover is 93% and does not vary substantially over the course of the year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nThe inhabitants of Metz are called Messin(e)s. Statistics on the ethnic and religious make up of the population of Metz are haphazard, as the French Republic prohibits making distinctions between citizens regarding race, beliefs, and political and philosophic opinions in the process of census taking. This would otherwise document the city to be a Germanic locale, as is the rest of the province and the neighboring Alsace.The French national census of 2012 estimated the population of Metz to be 119,551, while the population of Metz urban agglomeration was about 389,851. Through history, Metz's population has been impacted by the vicissitudes of the wars and annexations involving the city, which have prevented continuous population growth. More recently, the city has suffered from the restructuring of the military and the metallurgy industry. The historical population for the current area of Metz municipality is as follows:\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\nSeveral well-known figures have been linked to the city of Metz throughout its history. Renowned Messins include poet Paul Verlaine, composer Ambroise Thomas, and mathematician Jean-Victor Poncelet; numerous well-known German figures were also born in Metz notably during the annexation periods. Moreover, the city has been the residence of people such as writer Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Cardinal Mazarin, political thinker Alexis de Tocqueville, French patriot and American Revolutionary War hero Marquis Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette, and Luxembourg-born German-French statesman Robert Schuman.\n\n\n== Law and government ==\n\n\n=== Local law ===\n\nThe Local Law (French: droit local) applied in Metz is a legal system that operates in parallel with French law. Created in 1919, it preserves the French laws applied in France before 1870 and maintained by the Germans during the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, but repealed in the rest of France after 1871. It also maintains German laws enacted by the German Empire between 1871 and 1918, specific provisions adopted by the local authorities, and French laws that have been enacted after 1919 to be applicable only in Alsace-Lorraine. This specific local legislation encompasses different areas including religion, social work and finance.\nThe most striking of the legal differences between France and Alsace-Lorraine is the absence in Alsace-Lorraine of strict secularism, even though a constitutional right of freedom of religion is guaranteed by the French government. Alsace-Lorraine is still governed by a pre-1905 law established by the Concordat of 1801, which provides for the public subsidy of the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches and the Jewish religion.\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\nLike every commune of the present French Republic, Metz is managed by a mayor (French: maire) and a municipal council (French: conseil municipal), democratically elected by two-round proportional voting for six years. The mayor is assisted by 54 municipal councillors, and the municipal council is held on the last Thursday of every month. Since 2008, the mayor of Metz has been socialist Dominique Gros.The city belongs to the Metz Metropole union of cities, which includes the 40 cities of the Metz urban agglomeration. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle based in the former Intendant Palace. In addition, Metz is the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region, hosted in the former Saint-Clement Abbey.\n\n\n=== City administrative divisions ===\n\nThe city of Metz is divided into 14 administrative divisions:\n\n\n== Cityscape and environmental policy ==\n\nMetz contains a mishmash of architectural layers, bearing witness to centuries of history at the crossroads of different cultures, and features a number of architectural landmarks. The city possesses one of the largest Urban Conservation Areas in France, and more than 100 of the city's buildings are classified on the Monument Historique list. Because of its historical and cultural background, Metz is designated as French Town of Art and History, and has been submitted on to France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List.The city is famous for its yellow limestone architecture, a result of the extensive use of Jaumont stone. The historic district has kept part of the Gallo-Roman city with Divodurum's Cardo Maximus, then called Via Scarponensis (today the Trinitaires, Taison, and Serpenoise streets), and the Decumanus Maximus (today En Fournirue and d'Estr\u00e9es streets). At the Cardo and Decumanus intersection was situated the Roman forum, today the Saint-Jacques Square.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nFrom its Gallo-Roman past, the city preserves vestiges of the thermae (in the basement of the Golden Courtyard museum), parts of the aqueduct, and the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains.Saint Louis' square with its vaulted arcades and a Knights Templar chapel remains a major symbol of the city's High Medieval heritage. The Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral, several churches and H\u00f4tels, and two remarkable municipal granaries reflect the Late Middle Ages. Examples of Renaissance architecture can be seen in H\u00f4tels from the 16th century, such as the House of Heads (French: Maison des T\u00eates).The city hall and the buildings surrounding the town square are by French architect Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Blondel, who was awarded the task of redesigning and modernizing the centre of Metz by the Royal Academy of Architecture in 1755 the context of the Enlightenment. Neoclassical buildings from the 18th century, such as the Opera House, the Intendant Palace (the present-day prefecture), and the Royal Governor's Palace (the present-day courthouse) built by Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau, are also found in the city.The Imperial District was built during the first annexation of Metz by the German Empire. In order to \"germanise\" the city, Emperor Wilhelm II decided to create a new district shaped by a distinctive blend of Germanic architecture, including Renaissance, neo-Romanesque and neo-Classical, mixed with elements of Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Alsatian and mock-Bavarian styles. Instead of Jaumont stone, commonly used everywhere else in the city, stone used in the Rhineland, such as pink and grey sandstone, granite and basalt were used. The district features noteworthy buildings including the rail station and the Central Post Office by German architect J\u00fcrgen Kr\u00f6ger.Modern architecture can also be seen in the town with works of French architects Roger-Henri Expert (Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-de-l'Enfant-J\u00e9sus church, 1934), Georges-Henri Pingusson (Fire Station, 1960), and Jean Dubuisson (subdivisions, 1960s). The refurbishment of the former Ney Arsenal as a Concert Hall in 1989 and the erection of the Metz Arena in 2002, by Spanish and French architects Ricardo Bofill and French Paul Chemetov represent the Postmodern movement.The Centre Pompidou-Metz museum in the Amphitheatre District represents a strong architectural initiative to mark the entrance of Metz into the 21st century. Designed by Japanese architect Shigeru Ban, the building is remarkable for the complex, innovative carpentry of its roof, and integrates concepts of sustainable architecture. The project encompasses the architecture of two recipients of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, Shigeru Ban (2014) and French Christian de Portzamparc (1994). The Amphitheatre District is also conceived by French architects Nicolas Michelin, Jean-Paul Viguier, and Jean-Michel Wilmotte and designer Philippe Starck. The urban project is expected to be completed by 2023. Further, a contemporary music venue designed by contextualist French architect Rudy Ricciotti stands in the Borny District.\n\n\n=== Urban ecology ===\n\nUnder the leadership of such people as botanist Jean-Marie Pelt, Metz pioneered a policy of urban ecology during the early 1970s. Because of the failure of post-war urban planning and housing estate development in Europe during the 1960s, mostly based on the concepts of CIAM, Jean-Marie Pelt, then municipal councillor of Metz, initiated a new approach to the urban environment.Based initially on the ideas of the Chicago School, Pelt's theories pleaded for better integration of humans into their environment and developed a concept centered on the relationship between \"stone and water\". His policy was realized in Metz by the establishment of extensive open areas surrounding the Moselle and the Seille rivers and the development of large pedestrian areas. As a result, Metz has over 37 m2 (400 sq ft) of open areas per inhabitant in the form of numerous public gardens in the city.The principles of urban ecology are still applied in Metz with the implementation of a local Agenda 21 action plan. The municipal ecological policy encompasses the sustainable refurbishment of ancient buildings, the erection of sustainable districts and buildings, green public transport, and the creation of public gardens by means of landscape architecture.Additionally, the city has developed its own combined heat and power station, using waste wood biomass from the surrounding forests as a renewable energy source. With a thermal efficiency above 80%, the 45MW boiler of the plant provides electricity and heat for 44,000 dwellings. The Metz power station is the first local producer and distributor of energy in France.\n\n\n=== Military architecture ===\n\nAs a historic Garrison town, Metz has been heavily influenced by military architecture throughout its history. From ancient history to the present, the city has been successively fortified and modified to accommodate the troops stationed there. Defensive walls from classical antiquity to the 20th century are still visible today, incorporated into the design of public gardens along the Moselle and Seille rivers. A medieval bridge castle from the 13th century, named Germans' Gate (French: Porte des Allemands), today converted into a convention and exhibition centre, has become one of the landmarks of the city. It is still possible to see parts of the 16th century citadel, as well as fortifications built in the 1740s by Louis de Cormontaigne but based on designs by Vauban. Important barracks, mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries, are spread around the city: some, which are of architectural interest, have been converted to civilian use, such as the Arsenal Concert Hall by Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill.\nThe extensive fortifications of Metz, which ring the city, include early examples of S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res system forts. Other forts were incorporated into the Maginot Line. A hiking trail on the Saint-Quentin plateau passes through a former military training zone and ends at the now abandoned military forts, providing a vantage point from which to survey the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAlthough the steel industry has historically dominated Moselle's economy, Metz's efforts at economic diversification have created a base in the sectors of commerce, tourism, information technology and the automotive industry. The city is the economic heart of the Lorraine region and around 73,000 people work daily within the urban agglomeration. The transport facilities found in the conurbation, including the international high-speed railway, motorway, inland connections and the local bus rapid transit system, have made the city a transport hub in the heart of the European Union. Metz is home to the biggest harbour handling cereals in France with over 4,000,000 tons/year.Metz is home to the Moselle Chamber of Commerce. International companies such as PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, ArcelorMittal, SFR, and TDF have established plants and centres in the Metz conurbation. Metz is also the regional headquarters of the Caisse d'Epargne and Banque Populaire banking groups.\nMetz is an important commercial centre of northern France with France's biggest retailer federation, consisting of around 2,000 retailers. Important retail companies are found in the city, such as the Galeries Lafayette, the Printemps department store and the Fnac entertainment retail chain. The historic city centre displays one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France and a mall, the Saint-Jacques centre. In addition there are several multiplex movie theatres and malls found in the urban agglomeration.\nIn recent years, Metz municipality have promoted an ambitious policy of tourism development, including urban revitalization and refurbishment of buildings and public squares. This policy has been spurred by the creation of the Centre Pompidou-Metz in 2010. Since its inauguration, the institution has become the most popular cultural venue in France outside Paris, with 550,000 visitors per year. Meanwhile, Saint-Stephen Cathedral is the most visited building in the city, accommodating 652,000 visitors per year.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums and exhibition halls ===\n\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz is a museum of modern and contemporary arts, the largest temporary exhibition area in France outside Paris. The museum features exhibitions from the extensive collection of the Centre Pompidou, Europe's largest collection of 20th-century art.\nSaint Stephen's Cathedral is the Gothic cathedral of the city built during the 13th century. The cathedral exhibits the collection of the Bishopric of Metz, including paraments and items used in the service of the Eucharist. Metz Cathedral is sometimes nicknamed the Good Lord's Lantern (French: la Lanterne du Bon Dieu), as it has the largest expanse of stained glass windows in the world: 6,500 m2 (70,000 sq ft). These include works by Gothic and Renaissance master glass makers Hermann von M\u00fcnster, Th\u00e9obald of Lixheim, and Valentin Bousch, romantic Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, tachist Roger Bissi\u00e8re, cubist Jacques Villon and modernist Marc Chagall.\nAnother of the city's churches displays a complete set of stained glass windows by French modernist Jean Cocteau.In addition, Metz features other museums and exhibition venues, such as:\n\nThe FRAC Lorraine, a public collection of contemporary art of the Lorraine region. It is located in the 12th-century Saint-Liver H\u00f4tel and organizes exhibitions of local and international contemporary artists.\nThe Golden Courtyard (French: la Cour d'Or), a museum dedicated to the history of Metz, divided into four sections (e.g. archeology, medieval, architecture, and fine arts). The Golden Courtyard displays a rich collection of Gallo-Roman and medieval finds and the remains of the Gallo-Roman baths of Divodurum Mediomatricum, revealed by the extension works to the museums in the 1930s.\nThe Museum of the 1870 War and of the Annexion in Gravelotte, a village located within the Metz-Metropole conurbation and the site of the Battle of Gravelotte, the only museum in Europe dedicated to the Franco-Prussian War. The museum exhibits military and everyday items from the period as well as artworks related to the 1870 war. A mausoleum erected in 1904 honoring the soldiers who died during the battle, the Memorial Hall (French: La Halle du Souvenir), has been included in the museum.\nThe House for Europe, located on the estate of Robert Schuman in Scy-Chazelles in the Metz-Metropole conurbation, transformed into a museum and convention centre. Across the street is the fortified 12th Century church where Robert Schuman now rests. The Robert Schuman House for Europe organises cultural and educational events that introduce the visitor to Schuman's life and works and to the way Europe has been constructed and continues to develop today.\nVerlaine's House (French: la Maison de Verlaine) is a museum located in the house where the poet Paul Verlaine was born, dedicated to his work, featuring permanent and temporary exhibitions. The Solange Bertrand foundation, located in the artist's former house, conserves and displays her artworks. The municipal archives preserve and exhibit Metz's historical municipal records dating from medieval times to the present.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\nMetz has several venues for the performing arts. The Opera House of Metz, the oldest working opera house in France, features plays, dance, and lyric poetry. The Arsenal Concert Hall, dedicated to art music, is widely renowned for its excellent acoustics. The Trinitarians Club is a multi-media arts complex housed in the vaulted cellar and chapel of an ancient convent, the city's prime venue for jazz music. The Music Box (French: Boite \u00e0 Musique), familiarly known as BAM, is the concert venue dedicated to rock and electronic music. The Braun Hall and the Kolt\u00e8s Theater feature plays, and the city has two movie theaters specializing in Auteur cinema. The Saint-Jacques Square, surrounded by busy bars and pubs whose open-air tables fill the centre of the square.\nSince 2014, the former bus garage has been converted to accommodate over thirty artists in residence, in a space where they can create and rehearse artworks and even build set decorations. The artistic complex, called Metz Network of All Cultures (French: Toutes les Cultures en R\u00e9seau \u00e0 Metz) and familiarly known as TCRM-Blida, encompasses a large hall of 3,000 m2 (32,000 sq ft) while theater and dance companies benefit from a studio of 800 m2 (8,600 sq ft) with backstages.\n\n\n=== Metz in the arts ===\nMetz was an important cultural centre during the Carolingian Renaissance. For instance, Gregorian chant was created in Metz during the 8th century as a fusion of Gallican and ancient Roman repertory. Then called Messin Chant, it remains the oldest form of music still in use in Western Europe. The bishops of Metz, notably Saint-Chrodegang promoted its use for the Roman liturgy in Gallic lands under the favorable influence of the Carolingian monarchs. Messin chant made two major contributions to the body of chant: it fitted the chant into the ancient Greek octoechos system, and invented an innovative musical notation, using neumes to show the shape of a remembered melody. Metz was also an important centre of illumination of Carolingian manuscripts, producing such monuments of Carolingian book illumination as the Drogo Sacramentary.The Metz School (French: \u00c9cole de Metz) was an art movement in Metz and the region between 1834 and 1870, centred on Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal. The term was originally proposed in 1845 by the poet Charles Baudelaire, who appreciated the works of the artists. They were influenced by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix and inspired by the medieval heritage of Metz and its romantic surroundings. The Franco-Prussian War and the annexation of the territory by the Germans resulted in the dismantling of the movement. The main figures of the Metz School were Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, Auguste Migette, Auguste Hussenot, Louis-Th\u00e9odore Devilly, Christopher Fratin, and Charles P\u00eatre. Their works include paintings, engravings, drawings, stained-glass windows, and sculptures.\nA festival named \"passages\" takes place in May. Numerous shows are presented to it.\n\n\n=== The Graoully dragon as symbol of the city ===\n\nThe Graoully is depicted as a fearsome dragon, vanquished by the sacred powers of Saint Clement of Metz, the first Bishop of the city. The Graoully quickly became a symbol of Metz and can be seen in numerous insignia of the city, from the 10th century on. Writers from Metz tend to present the legend as an allegory of Christianity's victory over paganism, represented by the harmful dragon.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nLocal specialties include the quiche, the pot\u00e9e, the Lorrain p\u00e2t\u00e9, and also suckling pig. Different recipes, such as jam, tart, charcuterie and fruit brandy, are made from the Mirabelle and Damson plums. Also, Metz is the cradle of some pastries like the Metz cheese pie and the Metz Balls (French: boulet de Metz), a ganache-stuffed biscuit coated with marzipan, caramel, and dark chocolate. Local beverages include Moselle wine and Amos beer.The Covered Market of Metz is one of the oldest, most grandiose in France and is home to traditional local food producers and retailers. Originally built as the bishop's palace, the French Revolution broke out before the Bishop of Metz could move in and the citizens decided to turn it into a food market. The adjacent Chamber's Square (French: Place de la Chambre) is surrounded by numerous local food restaurants.\n\n\n=== Celebrations and events ===\nMany events are celebrated in Metz throughout the year. The city of Metz dedicates two weeks to the Mirabelle plum during the popular Mirabelle Festival held in August. During the festival, in addition to open markets selling fresh plums, mirabelle tarts, and mirabelle liquor, there are live music, fireworks, parties, art exhibits, a parade with floral floats, a competition, the crowning of the Mirabelle Queen and a gala of celebration.A literature festival is held in June. The Montgolfiades hot air balloon festival is organized in September. The second most popular Christmas Market in France is held in November and December. Finally, a Saint Nicholas parade honors the patron saint of the Lorraine region in December.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nMetz is home to the Football Club of Metz (FC Metz), a football association club in Ligue 1, the highest division of French football (as of 2019\u20132020 season). FC Metz has won three times the Ligue 2 (1935, 2007, and 2014), twice the Coupe de France (in 1984 and 1988) and the French League Cup (in 1986 and 1996), and was French championship runner-up in 1998.

The University of Lorraine, which ranks in 2016 among the top 15 of French universities and among the top 300 of universities in the world according to the 2016 Academic Ranking of World Universities, \n has a student body of over 55,000 and offers 101 accredited research centers organized in 9 research areas and 8 doctoral colleges.\n\n\n=== Graduate schools ===\nAt the end of the 1990s, the city expanded and the Metz Science Park was created in the southern area. Along with this expansion, several graduate schools took the opportunity to establish campuses in the park. At first, facilities were grouped around the lake Symphony, like Sup\u00e9lec in 1985 and Georgia Tech Lorraine in 1990. In 1996, the engineering school Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech (ENSAM) built a research and learning center next to the golf course. This opened the way to the development of a new area, where the Franco-German university (ISFATES) and the ENIM moved in 2010. These graduate schools often cooperate with the University of Lorraine. For instance, the university and ENSAM share research teams, laboratories, equipments, and doctoral programs.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\nPublic transport includes a bus rapid transit system, called Mettis. Mettis vehicles are high-capacity hybrid bi-articulated buses built by Van Hool, and stop at designated elevated tubes, complete with disability access. Mettis has its own planned and integrated transportation system, which includes two dedicated lines that spread out into the Metz conurbation. Mettis lanes A and B serve the city's major facilities (e.g., city centre, university campus, and hospitals), and a transport hub is located next to the railway station.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nMetz Railway Station is connected to the French high speed train (TGV) network, which provides a direct rail service to Paris and Luxembourg.

        "wiki": "The Metz Citadel was a fort built at Metz, northeast France in the second half of the 16th century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early phases ===\nAfter the French defeated the Holy Roman Empire  in the Siege of Metz in 1552, the city became a French protectorate as the 'Messine Republic' with a French garrison. To house it, an artillery-proof citadel was begun in 1556, only four years after the siege. Although the protectorate was still technically and legally part of the Empire, the city was now a 'de facto' French possession.\nThe citadel's construction was ordered by Fran\u00e7ois de Sc\u00e9peaux de Vieille-Ville, governor of the Three Bishoprics and involved the Italian military engineer Rocco Guerrini The city's population was forced to take part in the works and supply the French troops' needs. Completed around 1564, the citadel reinforced the south-west sector of the city's medieval ramparts, which had proved the hardest area to crack during the siege but could no longer be adapted to advances in artillery. Its aim was to control the city itself and its approaches, with cannon that could be turned to fire in either direction. As with the Spandau Citadel, built on the same model, it had four angled bastions surrounded by a four-sided moat - the neighbouring lac aux Cygnes was the former canal, allowing a link between the moat and the Moselle. The supply depot is the last visible trace of the building of this era.\nSome religious and secular buildings had to be demolished to build the citadel, but some churches were kept by the military authorities, such as the Templar Chapel and Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains. In 1648 the city was signed over to France in the Treaties of Westphalia and so the citadel was later integrated into a system of fortifications designed by S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban from 1676 and brought to fruition by his pupil Louis de Cormontaigne between 1728 and 1749.\n\n\n=== Present day ===\nThe citadel has recently been converted for civilian use - the former arsenal is now an auditorium, the supply depot a deluxe hotel. The porte Serpenois next to it is now only decorative and the former ditches have given way to green spaces such as the Esplanade de Metzand the jardin Boufflers. The Esplanade's gardens below place de la R\u00e9publique were extended after the citadel's destruction and occupy the site of the former ditches dug in 1816.The Governor's Palace was built by the Germans at the start of the 20th century on the site of a bastion of the dismantled citadel. Several Roman monuments and ramparts were brought to light on the site as well as the medieval Tour d'Enfer tower in the subsoil of the gardens.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography (in French) ==\nLouis-Jean-Baptiste Devilly, \u00ab Rapport sur les antiquit\u00e9s d\u00e9couvertes en 1822 \u00e0 la citadelle de Metz (sculptures et inscriptions romaines) \u00bb, dans les M\u00e9moires de l\u2019acad\u00e9mie de Metz, 1822-1823, pp. 72\u201379.\nF. de Saulcy, \u00ab Peintures \u00e0 fresque du XIV si\u00e8cle existant \u00e0 la citadelle de Metz \u00bb, dans les M\u00e9moires de l\u2019acad\u00e9mie de Metz, 1834-1835, S.

        "wiki": "Bordeaux (French pronunciation: [b\u0254\u0281do] (listen); Gascon Occitan: Bord\u00e8u [bu\u027e\u02c8\u00f0\u025bw]) is a port city on the Garonne in the Gironde department in Southwestern France.\nThe municipality (commune) of Bordeaux proper has a population of 257,804 (2019). Bordeaux is the centre of Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole that has a population of 796,273 (2019), the 5th largest in France after Paris, Marseille, Lyon and Lille with its immediate suburbs and closest satellite towns. The larger metropolitan area has a population of 1,232,550 (2016). It is the capital of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, as well as the prefecture of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called \"Bordelais\" (for men) or \"Bordelaises\" (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.\nBeing France's most prominent wine region, with 3,37 Billion \u20ac turnover it is both the center of a major wine-growing and wine-producing region hosting the world's most renowned estates, and a prominent powerhouse exercising significant influence on the world's wine and spirits industry, although no wine production is conducted within the city limits. It is home to the world's main wine fair, Vinexpo, and the wine economy in the metro area takes in 14.5 billion euros each year. Bordeaux wine has been produced in the region since the 8th century. The historic part of the city is on the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\" of the 18th century. After Paris, Bordeaux has the highest number of preserved historical buildings of any city in France.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 5th Century BC to the 11th Century ===\n\nAround 300 BC the region was the settlement of a Celtic tribe, the Bituriges Vivisci, named the town Burdigala, probably of Aquitanian origin.\nIn 107 BC the Battle of Burdigala was fought by the Romans who were defending the Allobroges, a Gallic tribe allied to Rome, and the Tigurini led by Divico. The Romans were defeated and their commander, the consul Lucius Cassius Longinus, was killed in battle.The city came under Roman rule around 60 BC, and it became an important commercial centre for tin and lead. It continued to flourish, especially during the Severan dynasty (3rd century), and acquired the status of capital of Roman Aquitaine. During this period were built the amphitheatre and the momument Les Piliers de Tutelle.\n\n\t\t\nIn 276 it was sacked by the Vandals. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the Visigoths in 414, and the Franks in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.\n\nIn the late 6th century the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the Merovingian kingdom of the Franks, but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish Duchy of Vasconia. Around 585 Gallactorius was made count of Bordeaux and fought the Basques.\nIn 732 the city was plundered by the troops of Abd er Rahman who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. Duke Eudes mustered a force to engage the Umayyads, eventually engaging them in the Battle of the River Garonne somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the Battle of Poitiers and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.\nIn 735 following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian duke Hunald led a rebellion to which Charles responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux.  However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son Waifer replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).\nDuring the last stage of the war against Aquitaine (760\u2013768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King Pepin the Short.  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (Frontiacus, Franciacus) near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (Wascones), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).\nIn 778 Seguin (or Sihimin) was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke Lupo, and possibly leading to the Battle of Roncevaux Pass[9]-. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of Vasconia, but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the Carolingians, sometimes the Counts of Bordeaux held the title concomitantly with that of Duke of Vasconia. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the Vikings when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count Seguin II marched on them but was captured and executed.\nAlthough the port of Bordeaux was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and Norman invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry Plantagenet in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between.\n\n\n=== 12th century to the 15th century, the English era ===\n\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess El\u00e9onore of Aquitaine to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in Le Mans, who within months of their wedding became King Henry II of England. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the cathedral of St. Andr\u00e9 and the belfry (Grosse Cloche) were built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cath\u00e9drale St-Andr\u00e9 was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul. It was also the capital of an independent state under Edward, the Black Prince (1362\u20131372), but after the Battle of Castillon (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory.\n\n\n=== 15th century to the 17th century ===\n\nIn 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament. However, it only begun to regain its importance during the 17th century when it became a major trading centre for sugar and slaves from the West Indies, along with its traditional wine exports.Bordeaux adhered to the Fronde, being effectively annexed to the Kingdom of France only in 1653, when the army of Louis XIV entered the city.\n\n\n=== 18th century to the 19th century, the golden era ===\nThe 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux. The Port of the Moon supplied the majority of Europe with coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton and indigo, becoming France's busiest port and the second busiest port in the world after London. Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. Victor Hugo found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take Versailles, add Antwerp, and you have Bordeaux\". Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann, a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor Napoleon III to transform a then still quasi-medieval Paris into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.\nTowards the end of the Peninsula war on 12 March 1814, the Duke of Wellington sent William Beresford with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-Bonapartist and the majority supported the Bourbons, so the British troops were treated as liberators.\n\n\t\t\nIn 1870, at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian war against Prussia, the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris. This recurred during the World War I and again very briefly during the World War II, when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nDuring World War II, Bordeaux fell under German Occupation.\nIn May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, Aristides de Sousa Mendes, who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.\nFrom 1941 to 1943, the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina Italiana) established BETASOM, a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the Battle of the Atlantic from this base, which was also a major base for German U-boats as headquarters of 12th U-boat Flotilla. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nBordeaux is located close to the European Atlantic coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around 500 km (310 mi) southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the river Garonne, and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to ocean liners through the Gironde estuary. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nBordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), or in the Trewartha climate classification system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.\nWinters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches 21 to 22 \u00b0C (70 to 72 \u00b0F)). The average seasonal winter temperature is 7.1 \u00b0C (44.8 \u00b0F), but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is 20.7 \u00b0C (69.3 \u00b0F). The summer of 2003 set a record with an average temperature of 23.3 \u00b0C (73.9 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Economy ==\nBordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.\nAs of 2014, the GDP of Bordeaux is \u20ac32.7 Billion.\n\n\n=== Wine ===\n\nThe vine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.\n\nBordeaux wine growing area has about 116,160 hectares (287,000 acres) of vineyards, 57 appellations, 10,000 wine-producing estates (ch\u00e2teaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles, the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five premier cru (first growth) red wines (four from M\u00e9doc and one, Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion, from Graves), established by the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855:\nBoth red and white wines are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called claret in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit verdot, Malbec, and, less commonly in recent years, Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re.\nWhite Bordeaux is made from Sauvignon blanc, S\u00e9millon, and Muscadelle. Sauternes is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, dessert wines such as Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem.\nBecause of a wine glut (wine lake) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and vine pull schemes, the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.\nThe Cit\u00e9 du Vin, a museum as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and academic seminars on the theme of wine opened its doors in June 2016.\n\n\n=== Others ===\nThe Laser M\u00e9gajoule will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing fundamental research and the development of the laser and plasma technologies. This project, carried by the French Ministry of Defence, involves an investment of 2 billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of regional planning, promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.\nSome 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including Dassault, EADS Sogerma, Snecma, Thales, SNPE, and others. The Dassault Falcon private jets are built there as well as the military aircraft Rafale and Mirage 2000, the Airbus A380 cockpit, the boosters of Ariane 5, and the M51 SLBM missile.\nTourism, especially wine tourism, is a major industry. Globelink.co.uk mentioned Bordeaux as the best tourist destination in Europe in 2015.Access to the port from the Atlantic is via the Gironde estuary. Almost nine million tonnes of goods arrive and leave each year.\n\n\n=== Major companies ===\nThis list includes indigenous Bordeaux-based companies and companies that have major presence in Bordeaux, but are not necessarily headquartered there.\n\nArena\nGroupe Bernard\nGroupe Castel\nCdiscount\nDassault\nJock\nMarie Brizard\nMcKesson Corporation\nOxbow\nRicard\nSanofi Aventis\nSmurfit Kappa\nSNECMA\nSolectron\nThales Group\n\n\n== Population ==\nAt the January 2011 census, there were 239,399 inhabitants in the city proper (commune) of Bordeaux. Bordeaux in its hey day had a population of 262,662 in 1968. The majority of the population is French, but there are sizable groups of Italians, Spaniards (Up to 20% of the Bordeaux population claim some degree of Spanish heritage), Portuguese, Turks, Germans.The built-up area has grown for more than a century beyond the municipal borders of Bordeaux due to urban sprawl, so that by the January 2011 census there were 1,140,668 people living in the overall metropolitan area of Bordeaux, only a fifth of whom lived in the city proper.\n\nPopulation Over Time\n\nLargest communities of foreigners :\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Presidential elections of 2007 ===\nAt the 2007 presidential election, the Bordelais gave 31.37% of their votes to S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal of the Socialist Party against 30.84% to Nicolas Sarkozy, president of the UMP. Then came Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 22.01%, followed by Jean-Marie Le Pen who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal with 25.87%, followed by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected President of the Republic with 53.06% against 46.94% for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round.\n\n\n=== Parliamentary elections of 2007 ===\nIn the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP Chantal Bourragu\u00e9 was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate Beatrice Desaigues. In the second round, it was Chantal Bourragu\u00e9 who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea Alain Jupp\u00e9 confronted the General Counsel PS Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Jupp\u00e9 was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the second round, it was finally Mich\u00e8le Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Jupp\u00e9, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.\n\n\n=== Municipal elections of 2008 ===\nIn 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist Alain Rousset. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and Mich\u00e8le Delaunay in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Jupp\u00e9 who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.\n\n\n=== European elections of 2009 ===\nIn the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:\nUMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front G\u00e9rard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.\nOnly candidates obtaining more than 5% are listed\n\n\n=== Municipal administration ===\n\nThe Mayor of the city is Nicolas Florian.\nVirginie Calmels is Deputy Mayor of Bordeaux in charge of the Economy, Employment and Sustainable Growth and Vice-President of the Urban Community of Bordeaux.Bordeaux is the capital of five cantons and the Prefecture of the Gironde and Aquitaine.\nThe town is divided into three districts, the first three of Gironde. The headquarters of Urban Community of Bordeaux M\u00e9riadeck is located in the neighbourhood and the city is at the head of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry that bears his name.\nThe number of inhabitants of Bordeaux is greater than 199,999 and less than 250,000 and so the number of municipal councilors is 61. They are divided according to the following composition:\n\n\n=== Mayors of Bordeaux ===\nSince 1947, there have been 5 mayors of Bordeaux:\n\nRPR was renamed to UMP in 2002 which was later renamed to Les Republicains in 2015\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== University ===\n\nThe university was created by the archbishop Pey Berland in 1441 and was abolished in 1793, during the French Revolution, before reappearing in 1808 with Napoleon. Bordeaux accommodates approximately 70,000 students on one of the largest campuses of Europe (235 ha).\nThe University of Bordeaux is divided into four:\n\nThe University Bordeaux 1, (Maths, Physical sciences and Technologies), 10,693 students in 2002\nThe University Bordeaux 2, Bordeaux Segalen (Medicine and Life sciences), 15,038 students in 2002\nThe University Bordeaux 3, Michel de Montaigne (Liberal Arts, Humanities, Languages, History), 14,785 students in 2002\nThe University Bordeaux 4, Montesquieu (Law, Economy and Management), 12,556 students in 2002\nInstitut of Political Sciences of Bordeaux.

The city is home to 362 monuments historiques (only Paris has more in France) with some buildings dating back to Roman times. Bordeaux, Port of the moon, has been inscribed on UNESCO World Heritage List as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\".\nBordeaux is home to one of Europe's biggest 18th-century architectural urban areas, making it a sought-after destination for tourists and cinema production crews. It stands out as one of the first French cities, after Nancy, to have entered an era of urbanism and metropolitan big scale projects, with the team Gabriel father and son, architects for King Louis XV, under the supervision of two intendants (Governors), first Nicolas-Fran\u00e7ois Dupr\u00e9 de Saint-Maur then the Marquis de Tourny.\nSaint-Andr\u00e9 Cathedral, Saint-Michel Basilica and Saint-Seurin Basilica are part of the World Heritage Sites of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France.\n\n\n=== Buildings ===\nMain sights include:\n\nPlace de la Bourse (1735\u20131755), designed by the Royal architect Jacques Gabriel as landscape for an equestrian statue of Louis XV, now replaced by the Fountain of the Three Graces.\nGrand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre (1780), a large neoclassical theater built in the 18th century.\nAll\u00e9es de Tourny\nCours de l'Intendance\nPlace du Chapelet\nPlace du Parlement\nPlace des Quinconces, the largest square in France.\nMonument aux Girondins\nPlace Saint-Pierre\nPont de pierre (1822)\nSaint Andrew's Cathedral, consecrated by Pope Urban II in 1096.

Firstly, during the 18th and 19th centuries, Bordeaux was an important slave port, which saw some 500 slave expeditions that cause the deportation of 150,000 Africans by Bordeaux shipowners. Secondly, even though the \"Triangular trade\" represented only 5% of Bordeaux's wealth, the city's direct trade with the Caribbean, that accounted for the other 95%, concerns the colonial stuffs made by the slave (sugar, coffee, cocoa). And thirdly, in that same period, a major migratory movement by Aquitanians took place to the Caribbean colonies, with Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) being the most popular destination. 40% of the white population of the island came from Aquitaine. They prospered with plantations incomes, until the first slave revolts which concluded in 1848 in the final abolition of slavery in France.Today a lot of traces and memorial sites are visible in the city. Moreover, in May 2009, the Museum of Aquitaine opened the spaces dedicated to \"Bordeaux in the 18th century, trans-Atlantic trading and slavery\". This work, richly illustrated with original documents, contributes to disseminate the state of knowledge on this question, presenting above all the facts and their chronology.The region of Bordeaux was also the land of several prominent abolitionists, as Montesquieu, Laffon deLad\u00e9bat and Elis\u00e9e Reclus. Others were members of the Society of the Friends of the Blacks as the revolutionaries Boyer-Fonfr\u00e8de, Gensonn\u00e9, Guadet and Ducos.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\nJardin public de Bordeaux, with inside the Jardin botanique de Bordeaux\nJardin botanique de la Bastide\nParc bordelais\nParc aux Ang\u00e9liques\nJardin des Lumi\u00e8res\nParc Rivi\u00e8re\nParc Floral\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas ===\nEurope's longest-span vertical-lift bridge, the Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas, was opened in 2013 in Bordeaux, spanning the River Garonne. The central lift span is 117-metre-long (384-foot) and can be lifted vertically up to 53 metres (174 feet) to let tall ships pass underneath. The \u20ac160 million bridge was inaugurated by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Mayor Alain Jupp\u00e9 on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late Jacques Chaban-Delmas, who was a former Prime Minister and Mayor of Bordeaux.\n\n\n=== Shopping ===\n\nBordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is Rue Sainte-Catherine. This pedestrian-only shopping street has 1.2 kilometers (0.75 mi) of shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. Rue Sainte-Catherine starts at Place de la Victoire and ends at Place de la Com\u00e9die by the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards Place de la Com\u00e9die and the nearby Cours de l'Intendance is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.\n\n\n=== Culture ===\nBordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, Arc en r\u00eave. Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the Op\u00e9ra national de Bordeaux. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nBordeaux is an important road and motorway junction. The city is connected to Paris by the A10 motorway, with Lyon by the A89, with Toulouse by the A62, and with Spain by the A63. There is a 45 km (28 mi) ring road called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.\n\nBordeaux has five road bridges that cross the Garonne, the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the Pont d'Aquitaine, a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas, was constructed in 2009\u20132012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a vertical-lift bridge with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.\nAnother bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.Lacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. Cycle lanes and bus lanes that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid bicycle-sharing system with automated stations has been established in 2010.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nThe main railway station, Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean, near the center of the city, has 12 million passengers a year. It is served by the French national (SNCF) railway's high speed train, the TGV, that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as Lille, Brussels, Amsterdam, Cologne, Geneva and London. The TGV also serves Toulouse and Irun (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to Nantes, Nice, Marseille and Lyon. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains (TER) operated by the SNCF to Arcachon, Limoges, Agen, P\u00e9rigueux, Langon, Pau, Le M\u00e9doc, Angoul\u00eame and Bayonne.\nHistorically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by Gustave Eiffel, to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.\nThe two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of 30 km/h (19 mph) became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at 60 km/h (37 mph). During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.\nSince July 2017, the LGV Sud Europe Atlantique is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nBordeaux is served by Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport, located 8 km (5.0 mi) from the city centre in the suburban city of M\u00e9rignac.\n\n\n=== Trams, buses and boats ===\n\nBordeaux has an important public transport system called Transports Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:\n\n4 tram lines (A, B, C and D)\n75 bus routes, all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)\n13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)\nAn electric bus shuttle in the city centre\nA boat shuttle on the Garonne riverThis network is operated from 5 am to 2 am.\nThere had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the Tramway de Bordeaux system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology (APS), a new cable-free technology developed by French company Alstom and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with limited access for cars.\nThe planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nThere are more than 400 taxicabs in Bordeaux.\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 13 min, while 15.5% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 7 km (4.3 mi), while 8% travel for over 12 km (7.5 mi) in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nThe 41,458-capacity Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux is the largest stadium in Bordeaux. The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the Stade Chaban-Delmas, which was a venue for the FIFA World Cup in 1938 and 1998, as well as the 2007 Rugby World Cup. In the 1938 FIFA World Cup, it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the Battle of Bordeaux. The ground was formerly known as the Stade du Parc Lescure until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, Jacques Chaban-Delmas.\nThere are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, Girondins de Bordeaux is the football team, playing in Ligue 1 in the French football championship. Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles is a rugby team in the Top 14 in the Ligue Nationale de Rugby.\nSkateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.\nBordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest cricket teams in France and are champions of the South West League.\nThere is a 250 m (820 ft) wooden velodrome, V\u00e9lodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of UCI Track Cycling World Cup events.\nThe 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.\nBetween 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as Juan Manuel Fangio, Stirling Moss, Jean Behra and Maurice Trintignant.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== International relationship ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\nBordeaux is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nBordeaux wine regions\nBordeaux\u2013Paris, a former professional road bicycle racing\nThe Burdigalian Age of the Miocene Epoch is named for Bordeaux\nCanel\u00e9, a local pastry\nCommunes of the Gironde department\nDogue de Bordeaux, a breed of dog originally bred for dog fighting\nFrench wine\nList of mayors of Bordeaux\nOperation Frankton, a British Combined Operations raid on shipping in the harbour at Bordeaux, in December 1942, during World War II\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Bordeaux\nGirondins\nAtlantic history\nTriangular trade\nHistory of slavery\n\n\n== References ==\nINSEE\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nChantal Callais and Thierry Jeanmonod (2019).

        "wiki": "Metz ( METS, French: [m\u025bs] (listen), Lorraine Franconian: [m\u025bts]) Latin: Divodurum Mediomatricorum is a city in northeast France located at the confluence of the Moselle and the Seille rivers. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle department and the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region. Located near the tripoint along the junction of France, Germany, and Luxembourg, the city forms a central place of the European Greater Region and the SaarLorLux euroregion.Metz has a rich 3,000-year-history, having variously been a Celtic oppidum, an important Gallo-Roman city, the Merovingian capital of Austrasia, the birthplace of the Carolingian dynasty, a cradle of the Gregorian chant, and one of the oldest republics in Europe. The city has been steeped in Romance culture, but has been strongly influenced by Germanic culture due to its location and history.Because of its historical, cultural, and architectural background, Metz has been submitted on France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. The city features noteworthy buildings such as the Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral with its largest expanse of stained-glass windows in the world, the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains being the oldest church in France, its Imperial Station Palace displaying the apartment of the German Kaiser, or its Opera House, the oldest one working in France. Metz is home to some world-class venues including the Arsenal Concert Hall and the Centre Pompidou-Metz museum.\nA basin of urban ecology, Metz gained its nickname of The Green City (French: La Ville Verte), as it has extensive open grounds and public gardens. The historic city centre is one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France.A historic garrison town, Metz is the economic heart of the Lorraine region, specialising in information technology and automotive industries. Metz is home to the University of Lorraine, Georgia Tech Lorraine, and a centre for applied research and development in the materials sector, notably in metallurgy and metallography, the heritage of the Lorraine region's past in the iron and steel industry.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn ancient times, the town was known as \"city of Mediomatrici\", being inhabited by the tribe of the same name. After its integration into the Roman Empire, the city was called Divodurum Mediomatricum, meaning Holy Village or Holy Fortress of the Mediomatrici, then it was known as Mediomatrix. During the 5th century AD, the name evolved to \"Mettis\", which gave rise to Metz.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMetz has a recorded history dating back over 2,000 years. Before the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar in 52 BC, it was the oppidum of the Celtic Mediomatrici tribe. Integrated into the Roman Empire, Metz became quickly one of the principal towns of Gaul with a population of 40,000, until the barbarian depredations and its transfer to the Franks about the end of the 5th century. Between the 6th and 8th centuries, the city was the residence of the Merovingian kings of Austrasia. After the Treaty of Verdun in 843, Metz became the capital of the Kingdom of Lotharingia and was ultimately integrated into the Holy Roman Empire, being granted semi-independent status. During the 12th century, Metz became a republic and the Republic of Metz stood until the 15th century.With the signature of the Treaty of Chambord in 1552, Metz passed to the hands of the Kings of France. As the German Protestant Princes who traded Metz (alongside Toul and Verdun) for the promise of French military assistance, had no authority to cede territory of the Holy Roman Empire, the change of jurisdiction wasn't recognised by the Holy Roman Empire until the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. Under French rule, Metz was selected as capital of the Three Bishoprics and became a strategic fortified town. With creation of the departments by the Estates-General of 1789, Metz was chosen as capital of the Department of Moselle. Although French-speaking, after the Franco-Prussian War and according to the Treaty of Frankfurt of 1871, the city was annexed into the German Empire, being part of the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine and serving as capital of the Bezirk Lothringen.Metz remained German until the end of World War I, when it reverted to France. However, after the Battle of France during the Second World War, the city was annexed once more by the German Third Reich. In 1944, the attack on the city by the U.S. Third Army freed the city from German rule and Metz reverted one more time to France after World War II.During the 1950s, Metz was chosen to be the capital of the newly created Lorraine region. With the creation of the European Community and the later European Union, the city has become central to the Greater Region and the SaarLorLux Euroregion.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMetz is located on the banks of the Moselle and the Seille rivers, 43 km (26.7 mi) from the Schengen tripoint where the borders of France, Germany, and Luxembourg meet. The city was built in a place where many branches of the Moselle river creates several islands, which are encompassed within the urban planning.The terrain of Metz forms part of the Paris Basin and presents a plateau relief cut by river valleys presenting cuestas in the north\u2013south direction. Metz and its surrounding countryside are included in the forest and crop Lorraine Regional Natural Park, covering a total area of 205,000 ha (506,566.0 acres).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of Lorraine is a semi-continental climate. The summers are warm and humid, sometimes stormy, and the warmest month of the year is July, when daytime temperatures average approximately 25 \u00b0C (77.0 \u00b0F). The winters are cold and snowy with temperature dropping to an average low of \u22120.5 \u00b0C (31.1 \u00b0F) in January. Lows can be much colder through the night and early morning and the snowy period extends from November to February.The length of the day varies significantly over the course of the year. The shortest day is 21 December with 7:30 hours of sunlight; the longest day is 20 June with 16:30 hours of sunlight. The median cloud cover is 93% and does not vary substantially over the course of the year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nThe inhabitants of Metz are called Messin(e)s. Statistics on the ethnic and religious make up of the population of Metz are haphazard, as the French Republic prohibits making distinctions between citizens regarding race, beliefs, and political and philosophic opinions in the process of census taking. This would otherwise document the city to be a Germanic locale, as is the rest of the province and the neighboring Alsace.The French national census of 2012 estimated the population of Metz to be 119,551, while the population of Metz urban agglomeration was about 389,851. Through history, Metz's population has been impacted by the vicissitudes of the wars and annexations involving the city, which have prevented continuous population growth. More recently, the city has suffered from the restructuring of the military and the metallurgy industry. The historical population for the current area of Metz municipality is as follows:\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\nSeveral well-known figures have been linked to the city of Metz throughout its history. Renowned Messins include poet Paul Verlaine, composer Ambroise Thomas, and mathematician Jean-Victor Poncelet; numerous well-known German figures were also born in Metz notably during the annexation periods. Moreover, the city has been the residence of people such as writer Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Cardinal Mazarin, political thinker Alexis de Tocqueville, French patriot and American Revolutionary War hero Marquis Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette, and Luxembourg-born German-French statesman Robert Schuman.\n\n\n== Law and government ==\n\n\n=== Local law ===\n\nThe Local Law (French: droit local) applied in Metz is a legal system that operates in parallel with French law. Created in 1919, it preserves the French laws applied in France before 1870 and maintained by the Germans during the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, but repealed in the rest of France after 1871. It also maintains German laws enacted by the German Empire between 1871 and 1918, specific provisions adopted by the local authorities, and French laws that have been enacted after 1919 to be applicable only in Alsace-Lorraine. This specific local legislation encompasses different areas including religion, social work and finance.\nThe most striking of the legal differences between France and Alsace-Lorraine is the absence in Alsace-Lorraine of strict secularism, even though a constitutional right of freedom of religion is guaranteed by the French government. Alsace-Lorraine is still governed by a pre-1905 law established by the Concordat of 1801, which provides for the public subsidy of the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches and the Jewish religion.\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\nLike every commune of the present French Republic, Metz is managed by a mayor (French: maire) and a municipal council (French: conseil municipal), democratically elected by two-round proportional voting for six years. The mayor is assisted by 54 municipal councillors, and the municipal council is held on the last Thursday of every month. Since 2008, the mayor of Metz has been socialist Dominique Gros.The city belongs to the Metz Metropole union of cities, which includes the 40 cities of the Metz urban agglomeration. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle based in the former Intendant Palace. In addition, Metz is the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region, hosted in the former Saint-Clement Abbey.\n\n\n=== City administrative divisions ===\n\nThe city of Metz is divided into 14 administrative divisions:\n\n\n== Cityscape and environmental policy ==\n\nMetz contains a mishmash of architectural layers, bearing witness to centuries of history at the crossroads of different cultures, and features a number of architectural landmarks. The city possesses one of the largest Urban Conservation Areas in France, and more than 100 of the city's buildings are classified on the Monument Historique list. Because of its historical and cultural background, Metz is designated as French Town of Art and History, and has been submitted on to France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List.The city is famous for its yellow limestone architecture, a result of the extensive use of Jaumont stone. The historic district has kept part of the Gallo-Roman city with Divodurum's Cardo Maximus, then called Via Scarponensis (today the Trinitaires, Taison, and Serpenoise streets), and the Decumanus Maximus (today En Fournirue and d'Estr\u00e9es streets). At the Cardo and Decumanus intersection was situated the Roman forum, today the Saint-Jacques Square.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nFrom its Gallo-Roman past, the city preserves vestiges of the thermae (in the basement of the Golden Courtyard museum), parts of the aqueduct, and the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains.Saint Louis' square with its vaulted arcades and a Knights Templar chapel remains a major symbol of the city's High Medieval heritage. The Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral, several churches and H\u00f4tels, and two remarkable municipal granaries reflect the Late Middle Ages. Examples of Renaissance architecture can be seen in H\u00f4tels from the 16th century, such as the House of Heads (French: Maison des T\u00eates).The city hall and the buildings surrounding the town square are by French architect Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Blondel, who was awarded the task of redesigning and modernizing the centre of Metz by the Royal Academy of Architecture in 1755 the context of the Enlightenment. Neoclassical buildings from the 18th century, such as the Opera House, the Intendant Palace (the present-day prefecture), and the Royal Governor's Palace (the present-day courthouse) built by Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau, are also found in the city.The Imperial District was built during the first annexation of Metz by the German Empire. In order to \"germanise\" the city, Emperor Wilhelm II decided to create a new district shaped by a distinctive blend of Germanic architecture, including Renaissance, neo-Romanesque and neo-Classical, mixed with elements of Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Alsatian and mock-Bavarian styles. Instead of Jaumont stone, commonly used everywhere else in the city, stone used in the Rhineland, such as pink and grey sandstone, granite and basalt were used. The district features noteworthy buildings including the rail station and the Central Post Office by German architect J\u00fcrgen Kr\u00f6ger.Modern architecture can also be seen in the town with works of French architects Roger-Henri Expert (Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-de-l'Enfant-J\u00e9sus church, 1934), Georges-Henri Pingusson (Fire Station, 1960), and Jean Dubuisson (subdivisions, 1960s). The refurbishment of the former Ney Arsenal as a Concert Hall in 1989 and the erection of the Metz Arena in 2002, by Spanish and French architects Ricardo Bofill and French Paul Chemetov represent the Postmodern movement.The Centre Pompidou-Metz museum in the Amphitheatre District represents a strong architectural initiative to mark the entrance of Metz into the 21st century. Designed by Japanese architect Shigeru Ban, the building is remarkable for the complex, innovative carpentry of its roof, and integrates concepts of sustainable architecture. The project encompasses the architecture of two recipients of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, Shigeru Ban (2014) and French Christian de Portzamparc (1994). The Amphitheatre District is also conceived by French architects Nicolas Michelin, Jean-Paul Viguier, and Jean-Michel Wilmotte and designer Philippe Starck. The urban project is expected to be completed by 2023. Further, a contemporary music venue designed by contextualist French architect Rudy Ricciotti stands in the Borny District.\n\n\n=== Urban ecology ===\n\nUnder the leadership of such people as botanist Jean-Marie Pelt, Metz pioneered a policy of urban ecology during the early 1970s. Because of the failure of post-war urban planning and housing estate development in Europe during the 1960s, mostly based on the concepts of CIAM, Jean-Marie Pelt, then municipal councillor of Metz, initiated a new approach to the urban environment.Based initially on the ideas of the Chicago School, Pelt's theories pleaded for better integration of humans into their environment and developed a concept centered on the relationship between \"stone and water\". His policy was realized in Metz by the establishment of extensive open areas surrounding the Moselle and the Seille rivers and the development of large pedestrian areas. As a result, Metz has over 37 m2 (400 sq ft) of open areas per inhabitant in the form of numerous public gardens in the city.The principles of urban ecology are still applied in Metz with the implementation of a local Agenda 21 action plan. The municipal ecological policy encompasses the sustainable refurbishment of ancient buildings, the erection of sustainable districts and buildings, green public transport, and the creation of public gardens by means of landscape architecture.Additionally, the city has developed its own combined heat and power station, using waste wood biomass from the surrounding forests as a renewable energy source. With a thermal efficiency above 80%, the 45MW boiler of the plant provides electricity and heat for 44,000 dwellings. The Metz power station is the first local producer and distributor of energy in France.\n\n\n=== Military architecture ===\n\nAs a historic Garrison town, Metz has been heavily influenced by military architecture throughout its history. From ancient history to the present, the city has been successively fortified and modified to accommodate the troops stationed there. Defensive walls from classical antiquity to the 20th century are still visible today, incorporated into the design of public gardens along the Moselle and Seille rivers. A medieval bridge castle from the 13th century, named Germans' Gate (French: Porte des Allemands), today converted into a convention and exhibition centre, has become one of the landmarks of the city. It is still possible to see parts of the 16th century citadel, as well as fortifications built in the 1740s by Louis de Cormontaigne but based on designs by Vauban. Important barracks, mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries, are spread around the city: some, which are of architectural interest, have been converted to civilian use, such as the Arsenal Concert Hall by Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill.\nThe extensive fortifications of Metz, which ring the city, include early examples of S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res system forts. Other forts were incorporated into the Maginot Line. A hiking trail on the Saint-Quentin plateau passes through a former military training zone and ends at the now abandoned military forts, providing a vantage point from which to survey the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAlthough the steel industry has historically dominated Moselle's economy, Metz's efforts at economic diversification have created a base in the sectors of commerce, tourism, information technology and the automotive industry. The city is the economic heart of the Lorraine region and around 73,000 people work daily within the urban agglomeration. The transport facilities found in the conurbation, including the international high-speed railway, motorway, inland connections and the local bus rapid transit system, have made the city a transport hub in the heart of the European Union. Metz is home to the biggest harbour handling cereals in France with over 4,000,000 tons/year.Metz is home to the Moselle Chamber of Commerce. International companies such as PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, ArcelorMittal, SFR, and TDF have established plants and centres in the Metz conurbation. Metz is also the regional headquarters of the Caisse d'Epargne and Banque Populaire banking groups.\nMetz is an important commercial centre of northern France with France's biggest retailer federation, consisting of around 2,000 retailers. Important retail companies are found in the city, such as the Galeries Lafayette, the Printemps department store and the Fnac entertainment retail chain. The historic city centre displays one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France and a mall, the Saint-Jacques centre. In addition there are several multiplex movie theatres and malls found in the urban agglomeration.\nIn recent years, Metz municipality have promoted an ambitious policy of tourism development, including urban revitalization and refurbishment of buildings and public squares. This policy has been spurred by the creation of the Centre Pompidou-Metz in 2010. Since its inauguration, the institution has become the most popular cultural venue in France outside Paris, with 550,000 visitors per year. Meanwhile, Saint-Stephen Cathedral is the most visited building in the city, accommodating 652,000 visitors per year.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums and exhibition halls ===\n\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz is a museum of modern and contemporary arts, the largest temporary exhibition area in France outside Paris. The museum features exhibitions from the extensive collection of the Centre Pompidou, Europe's largest collection of 20th-century art.\nSaint Stephen's Cathedral is the Gothic cathedral of the city built during the 13th century. The cathedral exhibits the collection of the Bishopric of Metz, including paraments and items used in the service of the Eucharist. Metz Cathedral is sometimes nicknamed the Good Lord's Lantern (French: la Lanterne du Bon Dieu), as it has the largest expanse of stained glass windows in the world: 6,500 m2 (70,000 sq ft). These include works by Gothic and Renaissance master glass makers Hermann von M\u00fcnster, Th\u00e9obald of Lixheim, and Valentin Bousch, romantic Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, tachist Roger Bissi\u00e8re, cubist Jacques Villon and modernist Marc Chagall.\nAnother of the city's churches displays a complete set of stained glass windows by French modernist Jean Cocteau.In addition, Metz features other museums and exhibition venues, such as:\n\nThe FRAC Lorraine, a public collection of contemporary art of the Lorraine region. It is located in the 12th-century Saint-Liver H\u00f4tel and organizes exhibitions of local and international contemporary artists.\nThe Golden Courtyard (French: la Cour d'Or), a museum dedicated to the history of Metz, divided into four sections (e.g. archeology, medieval, architecture, and fine arts). The Golden Courtyard displays a rich collection of Gallo-Roman and medieval finds and the remains of the Gallo-Roman baths of Divodurum Mediomatricum, revealed by the extension works to the museums in the 1930s.\nThe Museum of the 1870 War and of the Annexion in Gravelotte, a village located within the Metz-Metropole conurbation and the site of the Battle of Gravelotte, the only museum in Europe dedicated to the Franco-Prussian War. The museum exhibits military and everyday items from the period as well as artworks related to the 1870 war. A mausoleum erected in 1904 honoring the soldiers who died during the battle, the Memorial Hall (French: La Halle du Souvenir), has been included in the museum.\nThe House for Europe, located on the estate of Robert Schuman in Scy-Chazelles in the Metz-Metropole conurbation, transformed into a museum and convention centre. Across the street is the fortified 12th Century church where Robert Schuman now rests. The Robert Schuman House for Europe organises cultural and educational events that introduce the visitor to Schuman's life and works and to the way Europe has been constructed and continues to develop today.\nVerlaine's House (French: la Maison de Verlaine) is a museum located in the house where the poet Paul Verlaine was born, dedicated to his work, featuring permanent and temporary exhibitions. The Solange Bertrand foundation, located in the artist's former house, conserves and displays her artworks. The municipal archives preserve and exhibit Metz's historical municipal records dating from medieval times to the present.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\nMetz has several venues for the performing arts. The Opera House of Metz, the oldest working opera house in France, features plays, dance, and lyric poetry. The Arsenal Concert Hall, dedicated to art music, is widely renowned for its excellent acoustics. The Trinitarians Club is a multi-media arts complex housed in the vaulted cellar and chapel of an ancient convent, the city's prime venue for jazz music. The Music Box (French: Boite \u00e0 Musique), familiarly known as BAM, is the concert venue dedicated to rock and electronic music. The Braun Hall and the Kolt\u00e8s Theater feature plays, and the city has two movie theaters specializing in Auteur cinema. The Saint-Jacques Square, surrounded by busy bars and pubs whose open-air tables fill the centre of the square.\nSince 2014, the former bus garage has been converted to accommodate over thirty artists in residence, in a space where they can create and rehearse artworks and even build set decorations. The artistic complex, called Metz Network of All Cultures (French: Toutes les Cultures en R\u00e9seau \u00e0 Metz) and familiarly known as TCRM-Blida, encompasses a large hall of 3,000 m2 (32,000 sq ft) while theater and dance companies benefit from a studio of 800 m2 (8,600 sq ft) with backstages.\n\n\n=== Metz in the arts ===\nMetz was an important cultural centre during the Carolingian Renaissance. For instance, Gregorian chant was created in Metz during the 8th century as a fusion of Gallican and ancient Roman repertory. Then called Messin Chant, it remains the oldest form of music still in use in Western Europe. The bishops of Metz, notably Saint-Chrodegang promoted its use for the Roman liturgy in Gallic lands under the favorable influence of the Carolingian monarchs. Messin chant made two major contributions to the body of chant: it fitted the chant into the ancient Greek octoechos system, and invented an innovative musical notation, using neumes to show the shape of a remembered melody. Metz was also an important centre of illumination of Carolingian manuscripts, producing such monuments of Carolingian book illumination as the Drogo Sacramentary.The Metz School (French: \u00c9cole de Metz) was an art movement in Metz and the region between 1834 and 1870, centred on Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal. The term was originally proposed in 1845 by the poet Charles Baudelaire, who appreciated the works of the artists. They were influenced by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix and inspired by the medieval heritage of Metz and its romantic surroundings. The Franco-Prussian War and the annexation of the territory by the Germans resulted in the dismantling of the movement. The main figures of the Metz School were Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, Auguste Migette, Auguste Hussenot, Louis-Th\u00e9odore Devilly, Christopher Fratin, and Charles P\u00eatre. Their works include paintings, engravings, drawings, stained-glass windows, and sculptures.\nA festival named \"passages\" takes place in May. Numerous shows are presented to it.\n\n\n=== The Graoully dragon as symbol of the city ===\n\nThe Graoully is depicted as a fearsome dragon, vanquished by the sacred powers of Saint Clement of Metz, the first Bishop of the city. The Graoully quickly became a symbol of Metz and can be seen in numerous insignia of the city, from the 10th century on. Writers from Metz tend to present the legend as an allegory of Christianity's victory over paganism, represented by the harmful dragon.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nLocal specialties include the quiche, the pot\u00e9e, the Lorrain p\u00e2t\u00e9, and also suckling pig. Different recipes, such as jam, tart, charcuterie and fruit brandy, are made from the Mirabelle and Damson plums. Also, Metz is the cradle of some pastries like the Metz cheese pie and the Metz Balls (French: boulet de Metz), a ganache-stuffed biscuit coated with marzipan, caramel, and dark chocolate. Local beverages include Moselle wine and Amos beer.The Covered Market of Metz is one of the oldest, most grandiose in France and is home to traditional local food producers and retailers. Originally built as the bishop's palace, the French Revolution broke out before the Bishop of Metz could move in and the citizens decided to turn it into a food market. The adjacent Chamber's Square (French: Place de la Chambre) is surrounded by numerous local food restaurants.\n\n\n=== Celebrations and events ===\nMany events are celebrated in Metz throughout the year. The city of Metz dedicates two weeks to the Mirabelle plum during the popular Mirabelle Festival held in August. During the festival, in addition to open markets selling fresh plums, mirabelle tarts, and mirabelle liquor, there are live music, fireworks, parties, art exhibits, a parade with floral floats, a competition, the crowning of the Mirabelle Queen and a gala of celebration.A literature festival is held in June. The Montgolfiades hot air balloon festival is organized in September. The second most popular Christmas Market in France is held in November and December.

The University of Lorraine, which ranks in 2016 among the top 15 of French universities and among the top 300 of universities in the world according to the 2016 Academic Ranking of World Universities, \n has a student body of over 55,000 and offers 101 accredited research centers organized in 9 research areas and 8 doctoral colleges.\n\n\n=== Graduate schools ===\nAt the end of the 1990s, the city expanded and the Metz Science Park was created in the southern area. Along with this expansion, several graduate schools took the opportunity to establish campuses in the park. At first, facilities were grouped around the lake Symphony, like Sup\u00e9lec in 1985 and Georgia Tech Lorraine in 1990. In 1996, the engineering school Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech (ENSAM) built a research and learning center next to the golf course. This opened the way to the development of a new area, where the Franco-German university (ISFATES) and the ENIM moved in 2010. These graduate schools often cooperate with the University of Lorraine. For instance, the university and ENSAM share research teams, laboratories, equipments, and doctoral programs.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\nPublic transport includes a bus rapid transit system, called Mettis. Mettis vehicles are high-capacity hybrid bi-articulated buses built by Van Hool, and stop at designated elevated tubes, complete with disability access. Mettis has its own planned and integrated transportation system, which includes two dedicated lines that spread out into the Metz conurbation.

        "wiki": "Walygator Parc is an amusement park located in Maizi\u00e8res-les-Metz, Lorraine, France. Since its opening, back in 1989, the park has taken on a variety of names; successively Big Bang Smurf, Walibi Schtroumpf (Smurf), Walibi Lorraine up to its present name Walygator Parc.\n\n\n== History ==\nFirst designed within the extant halls of Sacilor's Laminoir by the Leisure division HHCP Architects in Maitland, Florida,  the theme park was named The New World of the Smurfs, or Le Nouveau Monde des Schtroumpfs. After a decision was made to abandon the mill, the park was re-designed by Grady Larkins and eventually opened up on May 9, 1989, as Big Bang Smurf. Built on the site of the former steel mills of Sacilor, the park was then managed by Sor\u00e9park, a company headed by Pierre Jullien. Construction costs topped \u20ac110 million.\n\nIn 1991, the park, on the verge of bankruptcy, is taken over by Walibi Group. An orange kangaroo is brought alongside Peyo's little blue men: Walibi Schtroumpf was born.\nIn 1998, parent Walibi Group is bought out by Premier Parks. At this point, the land on which Walibi Schtroumpf sits, totals 162 hectares of which only 42 are in use.\nIn 2003, Walibi Schtroumpf becomes Walibi Lorraine and the Smurfs characters are removed from the park.\nIn 2004 Six Flags (Premier Parks' successor), which had ownership of the park since 1998, divests itself of its European operations (apart from Warner Bros. Movie World Madrid, which was sold back to Time Warner and renamed Parque Warner Madrid in 2006). The park changes hands to Star Parks, of London-based Palamon Partners.\nIn 2006 Star Parks, in turn,  sells the park to brothers Claude and Didier Le Douarin. Around the same time, the Walibi brand is sold to French leisure giant Compagnie des Alpes. The new management team is left with no option but to adopt a new name.\nIn 2007, the park opens its doors under a new name: Walygator Parc.\nIn 2010, the park opens a new roller coaster, \"The Monster\", an inverted roller coaster by Swiss manufacturer Bolliger & Mabillard. The ride had previously anchored Expoland in Japan, and is a clone of Raptor at Cedar Point.\nIn 2013, the park, once again on the verge of bankruptcy, is sold to a group of investors made of Jacqueline Lejeune, Franck D\u00e9glin and Francois-J\u00e9r\u00f4me Parent.\nIn 2016, Jacqueline Lejeune and Franck D\u00e9glin sell Walygator Parc to Aspro Parks.\n\n\n== Coasters ==\n\n\n== Other attractions ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Water rides ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe park is located 15 km north of Metz, at 47.15984 N,2.988281 E.\n\nIt is served by the eponymous SNCF station.\n\n\n== External links ==\n(in French) official website of Walygator Park\n(in English) official website of Walygator Park in English",

        "wiki": "Metz ( METS, French: [m\u025bs] (listen), Lorraine Franconian: [m\u025bts]) Latin: Divodurum Mediomatricorum is a city in northeast France located at the confluence of the Moselle and the Seille rivers. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle department and the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region. Located near the tripoint along the junction of France, Germany, and Luxembourg, the city forms a central place of the European Greater Region and the SaarLorLux euroregion.Metz has a rich 3,000-year-history, having variously been a Celtic oppidum, an important Gallo-Roman city, the Merovingian capital of Austrasia, the birthplace of the Carolingian dynasty, a cradle of the Gregorian chant, and one of the oldest republics in Europe. The city has been steeped in Romance culture, but has been strongly influenced by Germanic culture due to its location and history.Because of its historical, cultural, and architectural background, Metz has been submitted on France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. The city features noteworthy buildings such as the Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral with its largest expanse of stained-glass windows in the world, the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains being the oldest church in France, its Imperial Station Palace displaying the apartment of the German Kaiser, or its Opera House, the oldest one working in France. Metz is home to some world-class venues including the Arsenal Concert Hall and the Centre Pompidou-Metz museum.\nA basin of urban ecology, Metz gained its nickname of The Green City (French: La Ville Verte), as it has extensive open grounds and public gardens. The historic city centre is one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France.A historic garrison town, Metz is the economic heart of the Lorraine region, specialising in information technology and automotive industries. Metz is home to the University of Lorraine, Georgia Tech Lorraine, and a centre for applied research and development in the materials sector, notably in metallurgy and metallography, the heritage of the Lorraine region's past in the iron and steel industry.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn ancient times, the town was known as \"city of Mediomatrici\", being inhabited by the tribe of the same name. After its integration into the Roman Empire, the city was called Divodurum Mediomatricum, meaning Holy Village or Holy Fortress of the Mediomatrici, then it was known as Mediomatrix. During the 5th century AD, the name evolved to \"Mettis\", which gave rise to Metz.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMetz has a recorded history dating back over 2,000 years. Before the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar in 52 BC, it was the oppidum of the Celtic Mediomatrici tribe. Integrated into the Roman Empire, Metz became quickly one of the principal towns of Gaul with a population of 40,000, until the barbarian depredations and its transfer to the Franks about the end of the 5th century. Between the 6th and 8th centuries, the city was the residence of the Merovingian kings of Austrasia. After the Treaty of Verdun in 843, Metz became the capital of the Kingdom of Lotharingia and was ultimately integrated into the Holy Roman Empire, being granted semi-independent status. During the 12th century, Metz became a republic and the Republic of Metz stood until the 15th century.With the signature of the Treaty of Chambord in 1552, Metz passed to the hands of the Kings of France. As the German Protestant Princes who traded Metz (alongside Toul and Verdun) for the promise of French military assistance, had no authority to cede territory of the Holy Roman Empire, the change of jurisdiction wasn't recognised by the Holy Roman Empire until the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. Under French rule, Metz was selected as capital of the Three Bishoprics and became a strategic fortified town. With creation of the departments by the Estates-General of 1789, Metz was chosen as capital of the Department of Moselle. Although French-speaking, after the Franco-Prussian War and according to the Treaty of Frankfurt of 1871, the city was annexed into the German Empire, being part of the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine and serving as capital of the Bezirk Lothringen.Metz remained German until the end of World War I, when it reverted to France. However, after the Battle of France during the Second World War, the city was annexed once more by the German Third Reich. In 1944, the attack on the city by the U.S. Third Army freed the city from German rule and Metz reverted one more time to France after World War II.During the 1950s, Metz was chosen to be the capital of the newly created Lorraine region. With the creation of the European Community and the later European Union, the city has become central to the Greater Region and the SaarLorLux Euroregion.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMetz is located on the banks of the Moselle and the Seille rivers, 43 km (26.7 mi) from the Schengen tripoint where the borders of France, Germany, and Luxembourg meet. The city was built in a place where many branches of the Moselle river creates several islands, which are encompassed within the urban planning.The terrain of Metz forms part of the Paris Basin and presents a plateau relief cut by river valleys presenting cuestas in the north\u2013south direction. Metz and its surrounding countryside are included in the forest and crop Lorraine Regional Natural Park, covering a total area of 205,000 ha (506,566.0 acres).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of Lorraine is a semi-continental climate. The summers are warm and humid, sometimes stormy, and the warmest month of the year is July, when daytime temperatures average approximately 25 \u00b0C (77.0 \u00b0F). The winters are cold and snowy with temperature dropping to an average low of \u22120.5 \u00b0C (31.1 \u00b0F) in January. Lows can be much colder through the night and early morning and the snowy period extends from November to February.The length of the day varies significantly over the course of the year. The shortest day is 21 December with 7:30 hours of sunlight; the longest day is 20 June with 16:30 hours of sunlight. The median cloud cover is 93% and does not vary substantially over the course of the year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nThe inhabitants of Metz are called Messin(e)s. Statistics on the ethnic and religious make up of the population of Metz are haphazard, as the French Republic prohibits making distinctions between citizens regarding race, beliefs, and political and philosophic opinions in the process of census taking. This would otherwise document the city to be a Germanic locale, as is the rest of the province and the neighboring Alsace.The French national census of 2012 estimated the population of Metz to be 119,551, while the population of Metz urban agglomeration was about 389,851. Through history, Metz's population has been impacted by the vicissitudes of the wars and annexations involving the city, which have prevented continuous population growth. More recently, the city has suffered from the restructuring of the military and the metallurgy industry. The historical population for the current area of Metz municipality is as follows:\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\nSeveral well-known figures have been linked to the city of Metz throughout its history. Renowned Messins include poet Paul Verlaine, composer Ambroise Thomas, and mathematician Jean-Victor Poncelet; numerous well-known German figures were also born in Metz notably during the annexation periods. Moreover, the city has been the residence of people such as writer Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Cardinal Mazarin, political thinker Alexis de Tocqueville, French patriot and American Revolutionary War hero Marquis Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette, and Luxembourg-born German-French statesman Robert Schuman.\n\n\n== Law and government ==\n\n\n=== Local law ===\n\nThe Local Law (French: droit local) applied in Metz is a legal system that operates in parallel with French law. Created in 1919, it preserves the French laws applied in France before 1870 and maintained by the Germans during the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, but repealed in the rest of France after 1871. It also maintains German laws enacted by the German Empire between 1871 and 1918, specific provisions adopted by the local authorities, and French laws that have been enacted after 1919 to be applicable only in Alsace-Lorraine. This specific local legislation encompasses different areas including religion, social work and finance.\nThe most striking of the legal differences between France and Alsace-Lorraine is the absence in Alsace-Lorraine of strict secularism, even though a constitutional right of freedom of religion is guaranteed by the French government. Alsace-Lorraine is still governed by a pre-1905 law established by the Concordat of 1801, which provides for the public subsidy of the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches and the Jewish religion.\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\nLike every commune of the present French Republic, Metz is managed by a mayor (French: maire) and a municipal council (French: conseil municipal), democratically elected by two-round proportional voting for six years. The mayor is assisted by 54 municipal councillors, and the municipal council is held on the last Thursday of every month. Since 2008, the mayor of Metz has been socialist Dominique Gros.The city belongs to the Metz Metropole union of cities, which includes the 40 cities of the Metz urban agglomeration. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle based in the former Intendant Palace. In addition, Metz is the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region, hosted in the former Saint-Clement Abbey.\n\n\n=== City administrative divisions ===\n\nThe city of Metz is divided into 14 administrative divisions:\n\n\n== Cityscape and environmental policy ==\n\nMetz contains a mishmash of architectural layers, bearing witness to centuries of history at the crossroads of different cultures, and features a number of architectural landmarks. The city possesses one of the largest Urban Conservation Areas in France, and more than 100 of the city's buildings are classified on the Monument Historique list. Because of its historical and cultural background, Metz is designated as French Town of Art and History, and has been submitted on to France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List.The city is famous for its yellow limestone architecture, a result of the extensive use of Jaumont stone. The historic district has kept part of the Gallo-Roman city with Divodurum's Cardo Maximus, then called Via Scarponensis (today the Trinitaires, Taison, and Serpenoise streets), and the Decumanus Maximus (today En Fournirue and d'Estr\u00e9es streets). At the Cardo and Decumanus intersection was situated the Roman forum, today the Saint-Jacques Square.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nFrom its Gallo-Roman past, the city preserves vestiges of the thermae (in the basement of the Golden Courtyard museum), parts of the aqueduct, and the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains.Saint Louis' square with its vaulted arcades and a Knights Templar chapel remains a major symbol of the city's High Medieval heritage. The Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral, several churches and H\u00f4tels, and two remarkable municipal granaries reflect the Late Middle Ages. Examples of Renaissance architecture can be seen in H\u00f4tels from the 16th century, such as the House of Heads (French: Maison des T\u00eates).The city hall and the buildings surrounding the town square are by French architect Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Blondel, who was awarded the task of redesigning and modernizing the centre of Metz by the Royal Academy of Architecture in 1755 the context of the Enlightenment. Neoclassical buildings from the 18th century, such as the Opera House, the Intendant Palace (the present-day prefecture), and the Royal Governor's Palace (the present-day courthouse) built by Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau, are also found in the city.The Imperial District was built during the first annexation of Metz by the German Empire. In order to \"germanise\" the city, Emperor Wilhelm II decided to create a new district shaped by a distinctive blend of Germanic architecture, including Renaissance, neo-Romanesque and neo-Classical, mixed with elements of Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Alsatian and mock-Bavarian styles. Instead of Jaumont stone, commonly used everywhere else in the city, stone used in the Rhineland, such as pink and grey sandstone, granite and basalt were used. The district features noteworthy buildings including the rail station and the Central Post Office by German architect J\u00fcrgen Kr\u00f6ger.Modern architecture can also be seen in the town with works of French architects Roger-Henri Expert (Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-de-l'Enfant-J\u00e9sus church, 1934), Georges-Henri Pingusson (Fire Station, 1960), and Jean Dubuisson (subdivisions, 1960s). The refurbishment of the former Ney Arsenal as a Concert Hall in 1989 and the erection of the Metz Arena in 2002, by Spanish and French architects Ricardo Bofill and French Paul Chemetov represent the Postmodern movement.The Centre Pompidou-Metz museum in the Amphitheatre District represents a strong architectural initiative to mark the entrance of Metz into the 21st century. Designed by Japanese architect Shigeru Ban, the building is remarkable for the complex, innovative carpentry of its roof, and integrates concepts of sustainable architecture. The project encompasses the architecture of two recipients of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, Shigeru Ban (2014) and French Christian de Portzamparc (1994). The Amphitheatre District is also conceived by French architects Nicolas Michelin, Jean-Paul Viguier, and Jean-Michel Wilmotte and designer Philippe Starck. The urban project is expected to be completed by 2023. Further, a contemporary music venue designed by contextualist French architect Rudy Ricciotti stands in the Borny District.\n\n\n=== Urban ecology ===\n\nUnder the leadership of such people as botanist Jean-Marie Pelt, Metz pioneered a policy of urban ecology during the early 1970s. Because of the failure of post-war urban planning and housing estate development in Europe during the 1960s, mostly based on the concepts of CIAM, Jean-Marie Pelt, then municipal councillor of Metz, initiated a new approach to the urban environment.Based initially on the ideas of the Chicago School, Pelt's theories pleaded for better integration of humans into their environment and developed a concept centered on the relationship between \"stone and water\". His policy was realized in Metz by the establishment of extensive open areas surrounding the Moselle and the Seille rivers and the development of large pedestrian areas. As a result, Metz has over 37 m2 (400 sq ft) of open areas per inhabitant in the form of numerous public gardens in the city.The principles of urban ecology are still applied in Metz with the implementation of a local Agenda 21 action plan. The municipal ecological policy encompasses the sustainable refurbishment of ancient buildings, the erection of sustainable districts and buildings, green public transport, and the creation of public gardens by means of landscape architecture.Additionally, the city has developed its own combined heat and power station, using waste wood biomass from the surrounding forests as a renewable energy source. With a thermal efficiency above 80%, the 45MW boiler of the plant provides electricity and heat for 44,000 dwellings. The Metz power station is the first local producer and distributor of energy in France.\n\n\n=== Military architecture ===\n\nAs a historic Garrison town, Metz has been heavily influenced by military architecture throughout its history. From ancient history to the present, the city has been successively fortified and modified to accommodate the troops stationed there. Defensive walls from classical antiquity to the 20th century are still visible today, incorporated into the design of public gardens along the Moselle and Seille rivers. A medieval bridge castle from the 13th century, named Germans' Gate (French: Porte des Allemands), today converted into a convention and exhibition centre, has become one of the landmarks of the city. It is still possible to see parts of the 16th century citadel, as well as fortifications built in the 1740s by Louis de Cormontaigne but based on designs by Vauban. Important barracks, mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries, are spread around the city: some, which are of architectural interest, have been converted to civilian use, such as the Arsenal Concert Hall by Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill.\nThe extensive fortifications of Metz, which ring the city, include early examples of S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res system forts. Other forts were incorporated into the Maginot Line. A hiking trail on the Saint-Quentin plateau passes through a former military training zone and ends at the now abandoned military forts, providing a vantage point from which to survey the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAlthough the steel industry has historically dominated Moselle's economy, Metz's efforts at economic diversification have created a base in the sectors of commerce, tourism, information technology and the automotive industry. The city is the economic heart of the Lorraine region and around 73,000 people work daily within the urban agglomeration. The transport facilities found in the conurbation, including the international high-speed railway, motorway, inland connections and the local bus rapid transit system, have made the city a transport hub in the heart of the European Union. Metz is home to the biggest harbour handling cereals in France with over 4,000,000 tons/year.Metz is home to the Moselle Chamber of Commerce. International companies such as PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, ArcelorMittal, SFR, and TDF have established plants and centres in the Metz conurbation. Metz is also the regional headquarters of the Caisse d'Epargne and Banque Populaire banking groups.\nMetz is an important commercial centre of northern France with France's biggest retailer federation, consisting of around 2,000 retailers. Important retail companies are found in the city, such as the Galeries Lafayette, the Printemps department store and the Fnac entertainment retail chain. The historic city centre displays one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France and a mall, the Saint-Jacques centre. In addition there are several multiplex movie theatres and malls found in the urban agglomeration.\nIn recent years, Metz municipality have promoted an ambitious policy of tourism development, including urban revitalization and refurbishment of buildings and public squares. This policy has been spurred by the creation of the Centre Pompidou-Metz in 2010. Since its inauguration, the institution has become the most popular cultural venue in France outside Paris, with 550,000 visitors per year. Meanwhile, Saint-Stephen Cathedral is the most visited building in the city, accommodating 652,000 visitors per year.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums and exhibition halls ===\n\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz is a museum of modern and contemporary arts, the largest temporary exhibition area in France outside Paris. The museum features exhibitions from the extensive collection of the Centre Pompidou, Europe's largest collection of 20th-century art.\nSaint Stephen's Cathedral is the Gothic cathedral of the city built during the 13th century. The cathedral exhibits the collection of the Bishopric of Metz, including paraments and items used in the service of the Eucharist. Metz Cathedral is sometimes nicknamed the Good Lord's Lantern (French: la Lanterne du Bon Dieu), as it has the largest expanse of stained glass windows in the world: 6,500 m2 (70,000 sq ft). These include works by Gothic and Renaissance master glass makers Hermann von M\u00fcnster, Th\u00e9obald of Lixheim, and Valentin Bousch, romantic Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, tachist Roger Bissi\u00e8re, cubist Jacques Villon and modernist Marc Chagall.\nAnother of the city's churches displays a complete set of stained glass windows by French modernist Jean Cocteau.In addition, Metz features other museums and exhibition venues, such as:\n\nThe FRAC Lorraine, a public collection of contemporary art of the Lorraine region. It is located in the 12th-century Saint-Liver H\u00f4tel and organizes exhibitions of local and international contemporary artists.\nThe Golden Courtyard (French: la Cour d'Or), a museum dedicated to the history of Metz, divided into four sections (e.g. archeology, medieval, architecture, and fine arts). The Golden Courtyard displays a rich collection of Gallo-Roman and medieval finds and the remains of the Gallo-Roman baths of Divodurum Mediomatricum, revealed by the extension works to the museums in the 1930s.\nThe Museum of the 1870 War and of the Annexion in Gravelotte, a village located within the Metz-Metropole conurbation and the site of the Battle of Gravelotte, the only museum in Europe dedicated to the Franco-Prussian War. The museum exhibits military and everyday items from the period as well as artworks related to the 1870 war. A mausoleum erected in 1904 honoring the soldiers who died during the battle, the Memorial Hall (French: La Halle du Souvenir), has been included in the museum.\nThe House for Europe, located on the estate of Robert Schuman in Scy-Chazelles in the Metz-Metropole conurbation, transformed into a museum and convention centre. Across the street is the fortified 12th Century church where Robert Schuman now rests. The Robert Schuman House for Europe organises cultural and educational events that introduce the visitor to Schuman's life and works and to the way Europe has been constructed and continues to develop today.\nVerlaine's House (French: la Maison de Verlaine) is a museum located in the house where the poet Paul Verlaine was born, dedicated to his work, featuring permanent and temporary exhibitions. The Solange Bertrand foundation, located in the artist's former house, conserves and displays her artworks. The municipal archives preserve and exhibit Metz's historical municipal records dating from medieval times to the present.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\nMetz has several venues for the performing arts. The Opera House of Metz, the oldest working opera house in France, features plays, dance, and lyric poetry. The Arsenal Concert Hall, dedicated to art music, is widely renowned for its excellent acoustics. The Trinitarians Club is a multi-media arts complex housed in the vaulted cellar and chapel of an ancient convent, the city's prime venue for jazz music. The Music Box (French: Boite \u00e0 Musique), familiarly known as BAM, is the concert venue dedicated to rock and electronic music. The Braun Hall and the Kolt\u00e8s Theater feature plays, and the city has two movie theaters specializing in Auteur cinema. The Saint-Jacques Square, surrounded by busy bars and pubs whose open-air tables fill the centre of the square.\nSince 2014, the former bus garage has been converted to accommodate over thirty artists in residence, in a space where they can create and rehearse artworks and even build set decorations. The artistic complex, called Metz Network of All Cultures (French: Toutes les Cultures en R\u00e9seau \u00e0 Metz) and familiarly known as TCRM-Blida, encompasses a large hall of 3,000 m2 (32,000 sq ft) while theater and dance companies benefit from a studio of 800 m2 (8,600 sq ft) with backstages.\n\n\n=== Metz in the arts ===\nMetz was an important cultural centre during the Carolingian Renaissance. For instance, Gregorian chant was created in Metz during the 8th century as a fusion of Gallican and ancient Roman repertory. Then called Messin Chant, it remains the oldest form of music still in use in Western Europe. The bishops of Metz, notably Saint-Chrodegang promoted its use for the Roman liturgy in Gallic lands under the favorable influence of the Carolingian monarchs. Messin chant made two major contributions to the body of chant: it fitted the chant into the ancient Greek octoechos system, and invented an innovative musical notation, using neumes to show the shape of a remembered melody. Metz was also an important centre of illumination of Carolingian manuscripts, producing such monuments of Carolingian book illumination as the Drogo Sacramentary.The Metz School (French: \u00c9cole de Metz) was an art movement in Metz and the region between 1834 and 1870, centred on Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal. The term was originally proposed in 1845 by the poet Charles Baudelaire, who appreciated the works of the artists. They were influenced by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix and inspired by the medieval heritage of Metz and its romantic surroundings. The Franco-Prussian War and the annexation of the territory by the Germans resulted in the dismantling of the movement. The main figures of the Metz School were Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, Auguste Migette, Auguste Hussenot, Louis-Th\u00e9odore Devilly, Christopher Fratin, and Charles P\u00eatre. Their works include paintings, engravings, drawings, stained-glass windows, and sculptures.\nA festival named \"passages\" takes place in May. Numerous shows are presented to it.\n\n\n=== The Graoully dragon as symbol of the city ===\n\nThe Graoully is depicted as a fearsome dragon, vanquished by the sacred powers of Saint Clement of Metz, the first Bishop of the city. The Graoully quickly became a symbol of Metz and can be seen in numerous insignia of the city, from the 10th century on. Writers from Metz tend to present the legend as an allegory of Christianity's victory over paganism, represented by the harmful dragon.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nLocal specialties include the quiche, the pot\u00e9e, the Lorrain p\u00e2t\u00e9, and also suckling pig. Different recipes, such as jam, tart, charcuterie and fruit brandy, are made from the Mirabelle and Damson plums. Also, Metz is the cradle of some pastries like the Metz cheese pie and the Metz Balls (French: boulet de Metz), a ganache-stuffed biscuit coated with marzipan, caramel, and dark chocolate. Local beverages include Moselle wine and Amos beer.The Covered Market of Metz is one of the oldest, most grandiose in France and is home to traditional local food producers and retailers. Originally built as the bishop's palace, the French Revolution broke out before the Bishop of Metz could move in and the citizens decided to turn it into a food market. The adjacent Chamber's Square (French: Place de la Chambre) is surrounded by numerous local food restaurants.\n\n\n=== Celebrations and events ===\nMany events are celebrated in Metz throughout the year. The city of Metz dedicates two weeks to the Mirabelle plum during the popular Mirabelle Festival held in August. During the festival, in addition to open markets selling fresh plums, mirabelle tarts, and mirabelle liquor, there are live music, fireworks, parties, art exhibits, a parade with floral floats, a competition, the crowning of the Mirabelle Queen and a gala of celebration.A literature festival is held in June. The Montgolfiades hot air balloon festival is organized in September. The second most popular Christmas Market in France is held in November and December. Finally, a Saint Nicholas parade honors the patron saint of the Lorraine region in December.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nMetz is home to the Football Club of Metz (FC Metz), a football association club in Ligue 1, the highest division of French football (as of 2019\u20132020 season). FC Metz has won three times the Ligue 2 (1935, 2007, and 2014), twice the Coupe de France (in 1984 and 1988) and the French League Cup (in 1986 and 1996), and was French championship runner-up in 1998.

Some of these institutions offer higher education programs such as classes pr\u00e9paratoires (undergraduate school) or BTS (technician certificate).\n\n\n=== University of Lorraine ===\n\nMetz is also home to the University of Lorraine (often abbreviated as UdL).  \nThe university is divided into two university centers, one in Metz (material sciences, technology, and management) and one in Nancy (biological sciences, health care, administration, and management). The University of Lorraine, which ranks in 2016 among the top 15 of French universities and among the top 300 of universities in the world according to the 2016 Academic Ranking of World Universities, \n has a student body of over 55,000 and offers 101 accredited research centers organized in 9 research areas and 8 doctoral colleges.\n\n\n=== Graduate schools ===\nAt the end of the 1990s, the city expanded and the Metz Science Park was created in the southern area. Along with this expansion, several graduate schools took the opportunity to establish campuses in the park. At first, facilities were grouped around the lake Symphony, like Sup\u00e9lec in 1985 and Georgia Tech Lorraine in 1990. In 1996, the engineering school Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech (ENSAM) built a research and learning center next to the golf course. This opened the way to the development of a new area, where the Franco-German university (ISFATES) and the ENIM moved in 2010. These graduate schools often cooperate with the University of Lorraine. For instance, the university and ENSAM share research teams, laboratories, equipments, and doctoral programs.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\nPublic transport includes a bus rapid transit system, called Mettis. Mettis vehicles are high-capacity hybrid bi-articulated buses built by Van Hool, and stop at designated elevated tubes, complete with disability access. Mettis has its own planned and integrated transportation system, which includes two dedicated lines that spread out into the Metz conurbation. Mettis lanes A and B serve the city's major facilities (e.g., city centre, university campus, and hospitals), and a transport hub is located next to the railway station.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nMetz Railway Station is connected to the French high speed train (TGV) network, which provides a direct rail service to Paris and Luxembourg. The time from Paris (Gare de l'Est) to Metz is 82 minutes. Additionally, Metz is served by the Lorraine TGV railway station, located at Louvigny, 25 km (16 mi) to the south of Metz, for high speed trains going to Nantes, Rennes, Lille and Bordeaux (without stopping in Paris). Also, Metz is one of the main stations of the regional express trains system, M\u00e9trolor.\n\n\n=== Motorways ===\nMetz is located at the intersection of two major road axes: the Eastern Motorway, itself a part of the European route E50 connecting Paris to Prague, and the A31 Motorway, which goes north to Luxembourg and south to the Mediterranean Sea towards Nancy, Dijon, and Lyon.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nThe Luxembourg International Airport is the nearest international airport, connected to Metz by M\u00e9trolor train. The Lorraine TGV Station is 75 minutes by train from France international Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport. Finally, Metz-Nancy-Lorraine Airport is located in Goin, 16.5 km (10.25 mi) southeast of Metz..\n\n\n=== Waterways ===\n\nMetz is located at the confluence of the Moselle and the Seille rivers, both navigable waterways. The marina connects Metz to the cities of the Moselle valley (i.e. Trier, Schengen, and Koblenz) via the Moselle river.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Religious heritage ===\nthe Gothic Saint Stephen's cathedral built during the 13th century. The cathedral is nicknamed the Good Lord's Lantern (French: la Lanterne du Bon Dieu), as it has the largest expanse of stained glass windows in the world and the tenth-highest nave in the world.\nthe Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains basilica, one of the oldest churches in the world and cradle of the Gregorian Chant.\nSaint Maximin's church featuring stained glass windows by French artist Jean Cocteau, and the Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-de-l'Enfant-J\u00e9sus church built by French architect Roger-Henri Expert.\nthe 13th century Romanesque Knights Templar's chapel, once part of the Templar commandery of Metz, the oldest Templar institution in the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n\n=== Civil heritage ===\nThe opera house of Metz Metropole built during the 18th century in Tuscany-influenced neo-Classical style.

          "You should not miss it. The market is not too big but it has a great variety of french food there, fruits and vegetables too. The visitors are local people and tourists too. Negative point: There\u2019s not a lot of place to seat and enjoy a meal.",

          "My wife and I took off early one Saturday morning for the Marche Couvert in Metz, France. We really enjoyed the markets indoor, and outdoor venders. We enjoy farmers markets and this one is like many others that you find in Europe. My favorite part was the bread, and I found",

          "What a wonderful market with an amazing selection. We grabbed some pastry and coffee and had a nice breakfast. We even picked up a sandwich for our drive later. The meat shops looked beautiful and were busy with local shoppers. If we were staying longer, we definitely would",
          "We were very impressed by the quality and variety of products sold at the March\u00e9 Couvert. Prices were a little more expensive but still worth it for healthy quality products. Also a great place to discover local products. There is a bigger farmers market on Saturday mornings",

        "wiki": "Valentin Bousch (circa 1490 \u2013 August 1541) was a Renaissance stained glass glazier and painter from Strasbourg, active in the Duchy of Lorraine and the Republic of Metz. A rarity among stained glass artists, Bousch is seen as one who actively sought to express new ideas in his art, often before they were widely used in the area, revising his method even from one window to the next, to create striking Renaissance effects and a personal style.\n\n\n== Life ==\nBousch was born in Strasbourg. The earliest mention of his work is at Saint-Nicolas-de-Port, near Nancy in 1514. Bousch was active there from 1514 to 1520, developed a large glass studio and made many windows for the Saint Nicolas basilica. In 1518 he also made windows for the priory church of Varang\u00e9ville on a command of the Bishop of Metz, John IV of Lorraine. On 25 September 1518, Valentin Bousch became the master glazier of the cathedral of Metz, where most work was done in the years 1520-1528, and 1534-1539. In between, he made a cycle of biblical scenes for the Saint-Firmin priory church in Flavigny-sur-Moselle. A number of documents relating to Bousch, including his will are at the Biblioth\u00e8que municipale de Nancy.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\nExamples of his skills are still in place in the Saint-Nicolas-de-Port Basilica, and the Metz Cathedral.  In addition, Bousch made several stained glass windows commissioned by the bourgeoisie of Metz for churches, hotels and chapels in the Lorraine countryside. A work attributed to his pupil, from 1548, is in the church of Saint Marcel, Ennery, Moselle.\n\n\n=== Saint-Nicolas-de-Port ===\nIn Saint-Nicolas-de-Port, much of the glass had not survived the Thirty Years' War and later events, and other parts are rearranged. Yet Bousch is attributed with the great rose window, and some windows, in full or part, in the small chapels. The repetitions, as well as some uncertain attributions, are explained by the fact that works were mostly commissioned by donors, and were no part of an overall design of the church.In the Chapelle Notre Dame des Victoires: The Dormition of Mary, her funeral and her Assumption; and in another window, the Presentation of Mary, the Visitation and the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple. In the Chapelle Saint Anne: possibly a window with the Annunciation and Saint Barbara, and another with church donors, coats of arms and Adrian of Nicomedia. In the Chapelle des saints archanges Michel, Rapha\u00ebl et Gabriel \u2013 only parts. In the Chapelle Saint Vincent et Saint Fiacre, two renditions of Saint George and the Dragon, a mounted Martin of Tours giving his cloak, and a Catherine of Alexandria, in windows shared with other artists.Two greater windows, are dedicated one to Saint Sebastian and other characters, the other mostly to the Transfiguration of Jesus, witnessed by a circle with Moses, Elijah, Saint Peter and others.\n\n\n=== Metz ===\n\nIn Metz Bousch made most of the stained glasses of the choir and south transept.\n\n\n=== Flavigny-sur-Moselle ===\nThe windows from Flavigny-sur-Moselle show Bousch's mature style. Out of a cycle of seven, three were lost by 1850, and four were sold in 1904 by the priory and are dispersed in North America. Two are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (along with four smaller pieces), one in St. Joseph church, Stockbridge, Massachusetts and one in a private collection in Canada.\n\n\n== Technique ==\nAs a glazier, Bousch produced large cuts of glass that were technically difficult to make, and allowed greater freedom in painting. Bousch's glasses were designed to keep each window's net of lead reinforcement lines along the picture's painted contours, so they will not interrupt the scene. At times, obvious lead lines were incorporated to emphasize an object, The more traditional method of placing lead lines in a way that help define panels, or spotlight a person's head, was used as a second choice in Bousch's work.\nAs a painter, Bousch utilized the large glass cuts to present rich arrays of shadows and background details, applying Grisaille color washes in modulation. The luminosity and color of his support medium came into play, as he left the brightest areas in the painting, the least matted surfaces in a glass. Illusionistic details were added to distract a viewer away from lead lines.\n\n\n== Influences ==\nBousch drew ideas from a number of artistic schools and media, and adapted them to glass painting, which resulted in defying some late gothic characteristics and traditional techniques of the stained glass field. Identified early influences were Rhenish or German Renaissance artists. Some elements from Hans Baldung Grien, and Albrecht D\u00fcrer, but also Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald 's Isenheim Altarpiece and the elder Cranach's 1503 Crucifixion, have been paired each with a parallel detail from Bousch. He most likely studied their works from prints, but probably also knew Baldung Grien, a citizen of Strasbourg, in person. Bousch had his own experience in panel painting.\nIn Bousch's later work, particularly the windows of Flavigny-sur-Moselle, in addition to using these artists' works as models, Bousch introduced many novelties. Gothic decorations like foliage and damask backgrounds were minimized, replaced by neoclassical architectural frames; Generic glass panels gave way to Bousch's more advanced cutting and leading; Halos, to naturalistic light beams.  Perspective was nuanced for different emotive ends, objects placed strategically in space and persons arranged in dramatic, purposeful postures, some in daring nudity. These are all signs of another layer of influences on Bousch work, that of Italian Renaissance and Mannerism. However, no direct sources of this phase are known.\nOn a religious dimension, his Flavigny-sur-Moselle work has also been connected with a Catholic prior's relatively sympathetic response to protestant humanist thought; the cycle is interpreted as identifying a history of predestination within the bible.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMetz Cathedral\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nMichel Herrold, Francis Roussel : Le vitrail en Lorraine : du XIIe au XXe si\u00e8cle.

It is located on place de la Com\u00e9die (next to Op\u00e9ra-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre), at the center of the Jardin d'Amour on the southwestern edge of \u00cele du Petit-Saulcy, which is surrounded by the Moselle.\n\nThe church was built by Glod, with the first stone being laid on 25 November 1901 (when Metz was a part of the German Empire), following plans by architect Conrad Wahn. It was inaugurated as the Neue evangelische Kirche on 14 May 1904 in the presence of Wilhelm II, German Emperor, and his wife Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein. The church is an example of Romanesque Revival architecture, and has been a monument historique of France since 1930.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Temple neuf de Metz at Wikimedia Commons\n\nLe Temple Neuf (in French)\nParoisse de Metz \u2013 Temple Neuf (in French)",

          "Close the city center, the Temple Neuf is one of the best symbol relating the history of the City. Particularly the sharing the French and German cultures and architectures.",
          "Absolutely cool place to stroll along the moselle river! And in case, you didn't know it, Donald trump is sinking in the moselle! Worth a trip to Metz just to see that artwork alone!",
          "Seen outside in the night walking around this lovely city, it's a marvellous show for the eyes, allocated between Can\u00e0l de la Mos\u00e8lle & a lovely square with gardens & art.",
          "Pretty little town in Lorraine ,Metz is as cute as button .Thousand or years of history ,culture ,architecture,art ,cuisine .Here every stone tells a story .Temple Neuf is reflected in the Moselle River and its medieval charm contrasts in a picturesque manner with the classical",

          "A beautiful little island setting for a classy antique church. Very picturesque from the nearby bridges and riverside promenade as well as approachable. And if you have kids you can present it as a miniature Hogwarts.",
          "Temple Neuf, built on the southwestern end of the Place de la Comedie between 1901 and 1905 in neo-romanesque style during the Wilhelmine period when Alsace and Lorraine were under German rule.",
          "Sitting right on the river this was very pretty. We didn't go inside but admired it from a few different angles outside. There is a large parking garage right near here that was clean with plenty of parking spots. Elevator or stairs right up to the top. We parked here and it",
          "As you can see everyone takes the same photos, but they do do for a reason, it\u2019s beautiful. Make sure to get your pics in while walking around the city.",
          "This church with German history lies in a nice area. You can walk round it and take lots of beautiful pictures, but it\u2019s only open for concerts or exhibitions. Read about its history to find out why the people of Metz are not interested in this place.",
          "If you want to relax from the city center it\u2019s a really nice and quiet walk along the river. Lovely swans.",
          "We stopped by this little temple on the small island on our walk around Metz. It is very picturesque on the river. Unfortunately it wasn\u2019t open on our visit but outside is just beautiful and quaint. Well worth a visit.",
          "it wasn't open,around some market was.Good location,nice building architecture but in Metz everywhere",
          "Not much to see except of course the building and its beautiful decorations. It is nice if you like to walk to take this in your route because the church is on an island and it is nice to walk around. We were there on Easter 2018 and it was very quiet walking. Not many people.",
          "The place is an excellent location for beautiful photos. It\u2019s in the small island and easily reachable by the bridge by foot.",
          "I think it was top place of the metz when compare with other cathedrals. The garden and architecture are so nice. You can read your book or listen your music between river and place. The place is both ideal for sunny and rainy weathers. It feels really good to watch this",
          "Beautiful site, the location is stunning, just wish it was more accessible. This place has seen better days. But the swans passing by more that make up for it.",
          "A stunningly beautiful castle in the middle of the water with swans swimming all around. It's lovely to just sit for a while and have relax with the scenery.",
          "Unfortunately, it was closed the day we visited, so I can't say anything about the inside, but it's an adorable building that you should definitely see if you're in the area! It kind of reminded me of Palais de l'Isle in Annecy, but far fewer tourists!",
          "The church is located on the tip of an island within the R Moselle and this creates a beautiful setting for the uninterrupted views and photographs. Constructed in the era of the Wilhelmian empire, the church reflects the neo-Romanesque design prevalent in so many structures",
          "This oasis of tranquility in the middle of the river will turn you away from the bustle of the small town of Metz. You will find several places to take romantic-looking photos. Unfortunately, the inside of the temple was not accessible even though it was declared on the outer",
          "Definitely not the most spectacular church in Metz, but it's in a central area, near a lot of other beautiful buildings, and worth spending a few minutes in.",
          "This Island was on my bucket list and i am so glad we got to see it and go on it. It is very beautiful to look at from a distance. When you go behind the church, there are quite a fee shaded areas where you can sit and relax. The locals like to hang out and talk or to read a",
          "Charming church, in contrast to the gothic Kathedral, much more quiet and calming. The river view, the quiet small garden and the elegant architecture.",
          "This is magical church on the isle. in summer you can take a catamaran and have a trip around on the river with beautiful swans around.",
          "By looking across the water you can see this picturesque view. Take the time to explore this unique city",
          "This church is my favorite in Metz. Combination of clean and simple, almost stark interior and strong and proud outside look impressed me. I spent a lot of time taking pictures from every possible angle and then relaxing in the church garden, watching river Mosel.",
          "Le Temple Neuf is one the most beautiful attraction you can see in Metz. It is located in a short walking distance from the historic city centre. However, if you are tired reaching this side there is a small park right behind the temple. You can rest on the benches and at the",
          "This is a really nice walk in a charming historical centre and provides a very good perspective on the architectural development of Metz. All landmarks are quite close to each other and it can be a nice day trip.",
          "Interesting church built during the German occupation which makes it dfiiferent to other buildings in the area",
          "You can walk around the exterior but cannot enter the temple at this time. very beautiful from all angles and when viewed from across the rivers. Would recommend if in Metz",
          "The architecture of this building is beautiful but we were disappointed when we couldn't enter to visit the interior. The little park around the temple is very clean and nice to see.",
          "This site was on the Michelin walking tour of Metz. The best viewpoint is from Moyen-Pont - quite picturesque and worth the stop. We continued across the Pont on Rue du Pont des-Morts and Rue Ste. Marcel and eventually came back on to the island to view the church and yard. You",
          "Built in 1904, this church of distinctly spiked-helmet Germanic aspect sits anachronistically next to Jacques Oger's Tuscan-style classical opera house on the place de la Com\u00e9die. Its austere interior lends itself perfectly to choral music and is often used as a concert venue.",
          "A nice building, originally located on an \"island\" in the middle of the river. We didn't go inside because there was a funeral service, but it's really nice from the outside anyway.",
          "Apparently built on the site of one of the oldest Churches in France, this building is well worth a look... Surrounded by water on two sides - we couldn't get access when we went but from the outside it is still a lovely place to see and stroll around... Park in the Theatre",
          "What a nice place to take gorgeous pictures! The temple itself was closed for visitation, but the view from there is amazing!",
          "This is a building of some charm and very photogenic. It wasn't open on the Monday morning we passed by but it has a path all the way around on a triangular plot. Worth a visit.",
          "This sober church enjoys its specific location, but it is not a very special or exciting building. Walking through this part of Metz you may visitit by passing by but it is not worth a special trip.",
          "We only walked around the outside but the park was very nice. A quiet break from the little hustle and bustle of Metz. Beautiful on a hot sunny day.",
          "As many of the reviews say, you can only walk around the outside. My recommendation is to bring a drink and and a snack, then take a break. There is plenty of shade. The church is beautiful.",
          "Another lovely religious site in Metz! Perhaps slightly less spectacular than the cathedral (only in size), it is still well worth a visit. It is not a long walk from the cathedral to Le Temple Neuf, and the area around the house of worship is lovely, too. Try strolling along",
          "You can only walk around it, this church is not open for public. That's a bit of a pity. Nicely situated near the river Mosselle",
          "This is by far the best picture I took from my trip to Metz. The Temple Neuf is an amazing history holder along with its architectonic building.",
          "This church carries an eclectic architectural style. It is placed on a little Island on the Moselle which reminds you slightly of Ile de France. The massive building radiates power. Unfortunately, we couldn't visit it from inside. In the evening, the church is well lighted but",
          "Very beautiful to look at, nicely situated, makes for a wonderful picture! There is nothing to be seen frominside but you can have a nice walk arouond it. Plenty of nice motifs for photographs around.",
          "Wanted to go inside here but it was closed so we didn't get to see inside which was disappointing but views by the side of it made it worth the walk",
          "Every visit of Metz is not complete without visiting Temple Neuf, you can spend as little time as you want there. Since the Temple isn't open to public, you can stroll through the riverbanks and take gorgeous pictures. There are also swans in the river, that you feed and take",
          "Just a shame the temple is not opened for visits. Look amazing from the outside with the river on both side of the garden. Absolutely lovely.",
          "I can't speak for the inside of Le Temple Neuf, but the view of the church from Moyen Pont is so beautiful. The church sits on a small island in the middle of the river with bridges either side. When we were there, there were more swans on the river than I had ever seen in one",
          "Thanks to it's location this church dominates the riverside almost as much as the Notre Dame in Paris, sadly it's not open for visit. Best photo moment is in the late afternoon.",
          "After a stroll from the Lac des cignes along the riverside, we ended up with a beautiful view on the Temple Neuf church. It is a very pretty church, situated on a little island, with a bridge connecting it to 'mainland' Metz on either side. Very nice photo spot on a stroll",
          "It is a must see place and take a picture , it is church constructed by the German when the region was under there role",
          "Le temple neuf, the Protestant Church, Church of the Germans, as the French call it, was built at the beginning of the previous century by the Germans, who controlled Metz and the whole district of Lorraine. The Church, located on a sort of a peninsula in the river Moselle, is",
          "Temple Neuf is a really beautiful neo-Romanesque German Protestant church on Petit Salcy Island, a short walk from St. Steven's Cathedral. The photos we took here were some of the best of our trip. Also on the island is Place de la Comedie, with an amazing garden/fountain,",
          "We enjoyed the saunter around the island, looking and relaxing in the shaded parts. Came back later to take photos at night. Lovely! The purple fences are wonderful foils for the architecture and the plants.",

Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle department and the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region. Located near the tripoint along the junction of France, Germany, and Luxembourg, the city forms a central place of the European Greater Region and the SaarLorLux euroregion.Metz has a rich 3,000-year-history, having variously been a Celtic oppidum, an important Gallo-Roman city, the Merovingian capital of Austrasia, the birthplace of the Carolingian dynasty, a cradle of the Gregorian chant, and one of the oldest republics in Europe. The city has been steeped in Romance culture, but has been strongly influenced by Germanic culture due to its location and history.Because of its historical, cultural, and architectural background, Metz has been submitted on France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. The city features noteworthy buildings such as the Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral with its largest expanse of stained-glass windows in the world, the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains being the oldest church in France, its Imperial Station Palace displaying the apartment of the German Kaiser, or its Opera House, the oldest one working in France. Metz is home to some world-class venues including the Arsenal Concert Hall and the Centre Pompidou-Metz museum.\nA basin of urban ecology, Metz gained its nickname of The Green City (French: La Ville Verte), as it has extensive open grounds and public gardens. The historic city centre is one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France.A historic garrison town, Metz is the economic heart of the Lorraine region, specialising in information technology and automotive industries. Metz is home to the University of Lorraine, Georgia Tech Lorraine, and a centre for applied research and development in the materials sector, notably in metallurgy and metallography, the heritage of the Lorraine region's past in the iron and steel industry.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn ancient times, the town was known as \"city of Mediomatrici\", being inhabited by the tribe of the same name. After its integration into the Roman Empire, the city was called Divodurum Mediomatricum, meaning Holy Village or Holy Fortress of the Mediomatrici, then it was known as Mediomatrix. During the 5th century AD, the name evolved to \"Mettis\", which gave rise to Metz.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMetz has a recorded history dating back over 2,000 years. Before the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar in 52 BC, it was the oppidum of the Celtic Mediomatrici tribe. Integrated into the Roman Empire, Metz became quickly one of the principal towns of Gaul with a population of 40,000, until the barbarian depredations and its transfer to the Franks about the end of the 5th century. Between the 6th and 8th centuries, the city was the residence of the Merovingian kings of Austrasia. After the Treaty of Verdun in 843, Metz became the capital of the Kingdom of Lotharingia and was ultimately integrated into the Holy Roman Empire, being granted semi-independent status. During the 12th century, Metz became a republic and the Republic of Metz stood until the 15th century.With the signature of the Treaty of Chambord in 1552, Metz passed to the hands of the Kings of France. As the German Protestant Princes who traded Metz (alongside Toul and Verdun) for the promise of French military assistance, had no authority to cede territory of the Holy Roman Empire, the change of jurisdiction wasn't recognised by the Holy Roman Empire until the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. Under French rule, Metz was selected as capital of the Three Bishoprics and became a strategic fortified town. With creation of the departments by the Estates-General of 1789, Metz was chosen as capital of the Department of Moselle. Although French-speaking, after the Franco-Prussian War and according to the Treaty of Frankfurt of 1871, the city was annexed into the German Empire, being part of the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine and serving as capital of the Bezirk Lothringen.Metz remained German until the end of World War I, when it reverted to France. However, after the Battle of France during the Second World War, the city was annexed once more by the German Third Reich. In 1944, the attack on the city by the U.S. Third Army freed the city from German rule and Metz reverted one more time to France after World War II.During the 1950s, Metz was chosen to be the capital of the newly created Lorraine region. With the creation of the European Community and the later European Union, the city has become central to the Greater Region and the SaarLorLux Euroregion.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMetz is located on the banks of the Moselle and the Seille rivers, 43 km (26.7 mi) from the Schengen tripoint where the borders of France, Germany, and Luxembourg meet. The city was built in a place where many branches of the Moselle river creates several islands, which are encompassed within the urban planning.The terrain of Metz forms part of the Paris Basin and presents a plateau relief cut by river valleys presenting cuestas in the north\u2013south direction. Metz and its surrounding countryside are included in the forest and crop Lorraine Regional Natural Park, covering a total area of 205,000 ha (506,566.0 acres).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of Lorraine is a semi-continental climate. The summers are warm and humid, sometimes stormy, and the warmest month of the year is July, when daytime temperatures average approximately 25 \u00b0C (77.0 \u00b0F). The winters are cold and snowy with temperature dropping to an average low of \u22120.5 \u00b0C (31.1 \u00b0F) in January. Lows can be much colder through the night and early morning and the snowy period extends from November to February.The length of the day varies significantly over the course of the year. The shortest day is 21 December with 7:30 hours of sunlight; the longest day is 20 June with 16:30 hours of sunlight. The median cloud cover is 93% and does not vary substantially over the course of the year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nThe inhabitants of Metz are called Messin(e)s. Statistics on the ethnic and religious make up of the population of Metz are haphazard, as the French Republic prohibits making distinctions between citizens regarding race, beliefs, and political and philosophic opinions in the process of census taking. This would otherwise document the city to be a Germanic locale, as is the rest of the province and the neighboring Alsace.The French national census of 2012 estimated the population of Metz to be 119,551, while the population of Metz urban agglomeration was about 389,851. Through history, Metz's population has been impacted by the vicissitudes of the wars and annexations involving the city, which have prevented continuous population growth. More recently, the city has suffered from the restructuring of the military and the metallurgy industry. The historical population for the current area of Metz municipality is as follows:\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\nSeveral well-known figures have been linked to the city of Metz throughout its history. Renowned Messins include poet Paul Verlaine, composer Ambroise Thomas, and mathematician Jean-Victor Poncelet; numerous well-known German figures were also born in Metz notably during the annexation periods. Moreover, the city has been the residence of people such as writer Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Cardinal Mazarin, political thinker Alexis de Tocqueville, French patriot and American Revolutionary War hero Marquis Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette, and Luxembourg-born German-French statesman Robert Schuman.\n\n\n== Law and government ==\n\n\n=== Local law ===\n\nThe Local Law (French: droit local) applied in Metz is a legal system that operates in parallel with French law. Created in 1919, it preserves the French laws applied in France before 1870 and maintained by the Germans during the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, but repealed in the rest of France after 1871. It also maintains German laws enacted by the German Empire between 1871 and 1918, specific provisions adopted by the local authorities, and French laws that have been enacted after 1919 to be applicable only in Alsace-Lorraine. This specific local legislation encompasses different areas including religion, social work and finance.\nThe most striking of the legal differences between France and Alsace-Lorraine is the absence in Alsace-Lorraine of strict secularism, even though a constitutional right of freedom of religion is guaranteed by the French government. Alsace-Lorraine is still governed by a pre-1905 law established by the Concordat of 1801, which provides for the public subsidy of the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches and the Jewish religion.\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\nLike every commune of the present French Republic, Metz is managed by a mayor (French: maire) and a municipal council (French: conseil municipal), democratically elected by two-round proportional voting for six years. The mayor is assisted by 54 municipal councillors, and the municipal council is held on the last Thursday of every month. Since 2008, the mayor of Metz has been socialist Dominique Gros.The city belongs to the Metz Metropole union of cities, which includes the 40 cities of the Metz urban agglomeration. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle based in the former Intendant Palace. In addition, Metz is the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region, hosted in the former Saint-Clement Abbey.\n\n\n=== City administrative divisions ===\n\nThe city of Metz is divided into 14 administrative divisions:\n\n\n== Cityscape and environmental policy ==\n\nMetz contains a mishmash of architectural layers, bearing witness to centuries of history at the crossroads of different cultures, and features a number of architectural landmarks. The city possesses one of the largest Urban Conservation Areas in France, and more than 100 of the city's buildings are classified on the Monument Historique list. Because of its historical and cultural background, Metz is designated as French Town of Art and History, and has been submitted on to France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List.The city is famous for its yellow limestone architecture, a result of the extensive use of Jaumont stone. The historic district has kept part of the Gallo-Roman city with Divodurum's Cardo Maximus, then called Via Scarponensis (today the Trinitaires, Taison, and Serpenoise streets), and the Decumanus Maximus (today En Fournirue and d'Estr\u00e9es streets). At the Cardo and Decumanus intersection was situated the Roman forum, today the Saint-Jacques Square.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nFrom its Gallo-Roman past, the city preserves vestiges of the thermae (in the basement of the Golden Courtyard museum), parts of the aqueduct, and the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains.Saint Louis' square with its vaulted arcades and a Knights Templar chapel remains a major symbol of the city's High Medieval heritage. The Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral, several churches and H\u00f4tels, and two remarkable municipal granaries reflect the Late Middle Ages. Examples of Renaissance architecture can be seen in H\u00f4tels from the 16th century, such as the House of Heads (French: Maison des T\u00eates).The city hall and the buildings surrounding the town square are by French architect Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Blondel, who was awarded the task of redesigning and modernizing the centre of Metz by the Royal Academy of Architecture in 1755 the context of the Enlightenment. Neoclassical buildings from the 18th century, such as the Opera House, the Intendant Palace (the present-day prefecture), and the Royal Governor's Palace (the present-day courthouse) built by Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau, are also found in the city.The Imperial District was built during the first annexation of Metz by the German Empire. In order to \"germanise\" the city, Emperor Wilhelm II decided to create a new district shaped by a distinctive blend of Germanic architecture, including Renaissance, neo-Romanesque and neo-Classical, mixed with elements of Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Alsatian and mock-Bavarian styles. Instead of Jaumont stone, commonly used everywhere else in the city, stone used in the Rhineland, such as pink and grey sandstone, granite and basalt were used. The district features noteworthy buildings including the rail station and the Central Post Office by German architect J\u00fcrgen Kr\u00f6ger.Modern architecture can also be seen in the town with works of French architects Roger-Henri Expert (Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-de-l'Enfant-J\u00e9sus church, 1934), Georges-Henri Pingusson (Fire Station, 1960), and Jean Dubuisson (subdivisions, 1960s). The refurbishment of the former Ney Arsenal as a Concert Hall in 1989 and the erection of the Metz Arena in 2002, by Spanish and French architects Ricardo Bofill and French Paul Chemetov represent the Postmodern movement.The Centre Pompidou-Metz museum in the Amphitheatre District represents a strong architectural initiative to mark the entrance of Metz into the 21st century. Designed by Japanese architect Shigeru Ban, the building is remarkable for the complex, innovative carpentry of its roof, and integrates concepts of sustainable architecture. The project encompasses the architecture of two recipients of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, Shigeru Ban (2014) and French Christian de Portzamparc (1994). The Amphitheatre District is also conceived by French architects Nicolas Michelin, Jean-Paul Viguier, and Jean-Michel Wilmotte and designer Philippe Starck. The urban project is expected to be completed by 2023. Further, a contemporary music venue designed by contextualist French architect Rudy Ricciotti stands in the Borny District.\n\n\n=== Urban ecology ===\n\nUnder the leadership of such people as botanist Jean-Marie Pelt, Metz pioneered a policy of urban ecology during the early 1970s. Because of the failure of post-war urban planning and housing estate development in Europe during the 1960s, mostly based on the concepts of CIAM, Jean-Marie Pelt, then municipal councillor of Metz, initiated a new approach to the urban environment.Based initially on the ideas of the Chicago School, Pelt's theories pleaded for better integration of humans into their environment and developed a concept centered on the relationship between \"stone and water\". His policy was realized in Metz by the establishment of extensive open areas surrounding the Moselle and the Seille rivers and the development of large pedestrian areas. As a result, Metz has over 37 m2 (400 sq ft) of open areas per inhabitant in the form of numerous public gardens in the city.The principles of urban ecology are still applied in Metz with the implementation of a local Agenda 21 action plan. The municipal ecological policy encompasses the sustainable refurbishment of ancient buildings, the erection of sustainable districts and buildings, green public transport, and the creation of public gardens by means of landscape architecture.Additionally, the city has developed its own combined heat and power station, using waste wood biomass from the surrounding forests as a renewable energy source. With a thermal efficiency above 80%, the 45MW boiler of the plant provides electricity and heat for 44,000 dwellings. The Metz power station is the first local producer and distributor of energy in France.\n\n\n=== Military architecture ===\n\nAs a historic Garrison town, Metz has been heavily influenced by military architecture throughout its history. From ancient history to the present, the city has been successively fortified and modified to accommodate the troops stationed there. Defensive walls from classical antiquity to the 20th century are still visible today, incorporated into the design of public gardens along the Moselle and Seille rivers. A medieval bridge castle from the 13th century, named Germans' Gate (French: Porte des Allemands), today converted into a convention and exhibition centre, has become one of the landmarks of the city. It is still possible to see parts of the 16th century citadel, as well as fortifications built in the 1740s by Louis de Cormontaigne but based on designs by Vauban. Important barracks, mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries, are spread around the city: some, which are of architectural interest, have been converted to civilian use, such as the Arsenal Concert Hall by Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill.\nThe extensive fortifications of Metz, which ring the city, include early examples of S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res system forts. Other forts were incorporated into the Maginot Line. A hiking trail on the Saint-Quentin plateau passes through a former military training zone and ends at the now abandoned military forts, providing a vantage point from which to survey the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAlthough the steel industry has historically dominated Moselle's economy, Metz's efforts at economic diversification have created a base in the sectors of commerce, tourism, information technology and the automotive industry. The city is the economic heart of the Lorraine region and around 73,000 people work daily within the urban agglomeration. The transport facilities found in the conurbation, including the international high-speed railway, motorway, inland connections and the local bus rapid transit system, have made the city a transport hub in the heart of the European Union. Metz is home to the biggest harbour handling cereals in France with over 4,000,000 tons/year.Metz is home to the Moselle Chamber of Commerce. International companies such as PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, ArcelorMittal, SFR, and TDF have established plants and centres in the Metz conurbation. Metz is also the regional headquarters of the Caisse d'Epargne and Banque Populaire banking groups.\nMetz is an important commercial centre of northern France with France's biggest retailer federation, consisting of around 2,000 retailers. Important retail companies are found in the city, such as the Galeries Lafayette, the Printemps department store and the Fnac entertainment retail chain. The historic city centre displays one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France and a mall, the Saint-Jacques centre. In addition there are several multiplex movie theatres and malls found in the urban agglomeration.\nIn recent years, Metz municipality have promoted an ambitious policy of tourism development, including urban revitalization and refurbishment of buildings and public squares. This policy has been spurred by the creation of the Centre Pompidou-Metz in 2010. Since its inauguration, the institution has become the most popular cultural venue in France outside Paris, with 550,000 visitors per year. Meanwhile, Saint-Stephen Cathedral is the most visited building in the city, accommodating 652,000 visitors per year.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums and exhibition halls ===\n\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz is a museum of modern and contemporary arts, the largest temporary exhibition area in France outside Paris.

For instance, Gregorian chant was created in Metz during the 8th century as a fusion of Gallican and ancient Roman repertory. Then called Messin Chant, it remains the oldest form of music still in use in Western Europe. The bishops of Metz, notably Saint-Chrodegang promoted its use for the Roman liturgy in Gallic lands under the favorable influence of the Carolingian monarchs. Messin chant made two major contributions to the body of chant: it fitted the chant into the ancient Greek octoechos system, and invented an innovative musical notation, using neumes to show the shape of a remembered melody. Metz was also an important centre of illumination of Carolingian manuscripts, producing such monuments of Carolingian book illumination as the Drogo Sacramentary.The Metz School (French: \u00c9cole de Metz) was an art movement in Metz and the region between 1834 and 1870, centred on Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal. The term was originally proposed in 1845 by the poet Charles Baudelaire, who appreciated the works of the artists. They were influenced by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix and inspired by the medieval heritage of Metz and its romantic surroundings. The Franco-Prussian War and the annexation of the territory by the Germans resulted in the dismantling of the movement. The main figures of the Metz School were Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, Auguste Migette, Auguste Hussenot, Louis-Th\u00e9odore Devilly, Christopher Fratin, and Charles P\u00eatre. Their works include paintings, engravings, drawings, stained-glass windows, and sculptures.\nA festival named \"passages\" takes place in May. Numerous shows are presented to it.\n\n\n=== The Graoully dragon as symbol of the city ===\n\nThe Graoully is depicted as a fearsome dragon, vanquished by the sacred powers of Saint Clement of Metz, the first Bishop of the city. The Graoully quickly became a symbol of Metz and can be seen in numerous insignia of the city, from the 10th century on. Writers from Metz tend to present the legend as an allegory of Christianity's victory over paganism, represented by the harmful dragon.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nLocal specialties include the quiche, the pot\u00e9e, the Lorrain p\u00e2t\u00e9, and also suckling pig.

Also, Metz is the cradle of some pastries like the Metz cheese pie and the Metz Balls (French: boulet de Metz), a ganache-stuffed biscuit coated with marzipan, caramel, and dark chocolate. Local beverages include Moselle wine and Amos beer.The Covered Market of Metz is one of the oldest, most grandiose in France and is home to traditional local food producers and retailers. Originally built as the bishop's palace, the French Revolution broke out before the Bishop of Metz could move in and the citizens decided to turn it into a food market. The adjacent Chamber's Square (French: Place de la Chambre) is surrounded by numerous local food restaurants.\n\n\n=== Celebrations and events ===\nMany events are celebrated in Metz throughout the year.

Along with this expansion, several graduate schools took the opportunity to establish campuses in the park. At first, facilities were grouped around the lake Symphony, like Sup\u00e9lec in 1985 and Georgia Tech Lorraine in 1990. In 1996, the engineering school Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech (ENSAM) built a research and learning center next to the golf course. This opened the way to the development of a new area, where the Franco-German university (ISFATES) and the ENIM moved in 2010. These graduate schools often cooperate with the University of Lorraine. For instance, the university and ENSAM share research teams, laboratories, equipments, and doctoral programs.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\nPublic transport includes a bus rapid transit system, called Mettis. Mettis vehicles are high-capacity hybrid bi-articulated buses built by Van Hool, and stop at designated elevated tubes, complete with disability access.

      "name": "Fort Queuleu",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Fort de Queuleu is a fortification to the southeast of Metz, near Queuleu, France. Construction began while part of Lorraine was under French rule in 1868. After the interruption of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, the fort was improved between 1872 and 1875 by the German Empire, which had conquered the area in the war. Renamed Fort Goeben, it formed part of the first ring of the fortifications of Metz. Functionally obsolete by the First World War, it saw no military action, but was used by the Germans as a detention center for members of the French Resistance during World War II.\n\n\n== Context ==\nThe fort was one of the first built according to the fortification system developed by Lieutenant Colonel Raymond Adolphe S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res. The goal was to build a discontinuous enclosure around Metz using a series of artillery forts spaced a cannonshot apart. In the 1860s tension was rising between France and Germany, causing France to attend to the fortification of its frontiers. Metz, close to the border and a strategic road and rail crossing, was the beneficiary of one of the first programs of fortification. Before all of the forts could be completed, France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War and the area around Metz was annexed to Germany. Metz then became a crucial strongpoint on Germany's frontier, receiving sustained attention to its defenses that culminated in the Moselstellung of the early twentieth century.The pre-war French construction program comprised eight forts surrounding Metz at a distance of 3.5 - 5.5 km from the center of the city. Planning began in 1864, and in 1867 the project was placed under the supervision of S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res. Compared with later S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res system forts, the fort's design is reminiscent of the bastioned enclosures of Vauban of the 18th century.  In their developed form, the S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res forts of the 1870s were much simplified in plan, with less overt reference to historic prototypes.Casemates were arranged on two levels. As constructed, a large proportion of the fort's artillery was placed on the surface of the fort, exposed to high-angle artillery fire. This was not considered a major disadvantage in the 1860s, when most opposing artillery was expected to be smooth-bored guns firing solid shot or gunpowder-filled shells on a low trajectory, with the aim of battering the walls of the fort so that breaches could be exploited by infantry. During the 1870s rifled guns came into widespread use, making exposed masonry walls dangerously vulnerable. At the same time, fuses were developed that enabled shells fired at a high angle from howitzers or mortars to explode in the air above an open position, making exposed fixed-position artillery untenable. Fort de Queuleu was thus already obsolete when it was taken over by the Germans.The fort's construction was improved under the German Empire, which renamed it Fort Goeben after a Prussian general who had distinguished himself at the Battle of Spicheren on 6 August 1870. Immediate German construction focused on dispersing gun batteries to flanking positions and reinforcing protection for personnel and ammunition against shellfire. In 1885, new explosives led to a massive increase in the explosive power of artillery projectiles, the so-called crise de l'obus-torpille (\"torpedo-shell crisis). This development made unprotected artillery and masonry construction entirely obsolete, as the new shells could easily destroy masonry structures.  In response, concrete and earth sheltering was employed in new forts, and older forts were reinforced under the new principles. In 1885 a program of reinforcement covered some critical areas of Queuleu with concrete and provided better infantry shelters. As an early fort, Queuleu has relatively few underground passages compared to the Moselstellung forts of the 1890s, but does feature countermine passages extending from the front of the fort.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhile the Moselle valley was under German control during World War II the fort was used starting in 1943 by the German occupiers as an internment camp (S Sonderlager) for members of the French Resistance, including Joseph Derhan. The  fort was called the \"Hell of Queuleu\" (Enfer de Queuleu). It was not a concentration camp, but an interrogation center for captured or arrested members of the Resistance, commanded by Schutzstaffel Hauptscharf\u00fchrer Georg Friedrich Hempen (* 27.07.1905). Between 1500 and 1800 people were detained at Queuleu.  Prisoners were held in Casemate A of the fort. Thirty-six died there and four escaped through a ventilation shaft. Among the most notable prisoners were the Mario Group of resisters, led by Jean Burger. Almost all of the prisoners were transferred to concentration camps as American forces approached Metz in late 1944. The Germans evacuated the fort on 17 August 1944 and moved the majority of the detainees to Struthof, Schirmeck or Ravensbr\u00fcck.Georg Hempen was tried and sentenced in absentia to death. He was arrested in 1962 while working as a police officer in Oldenburg, Germany. After a lengthy trial, he was acquitted on technical grounds.\n\n\n== Present situation ==\nA memorial to the Resistance and Deportation, designed by architect R. Zonca, was inaugurated on 20 November 1977, when the fort became the property of the city of Metz. It had been designated a historical monument in 1971. The fort is open to the public at scheduled times.\n\n\n== Attribution ==\nThis article incorporates text translated from the corresponding French Wikipedia article as of March 31, 2010.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nL\u00e9on Burger, Trag\u00e9dies mosellanes, le fort de Queuleu \u00e0 Metz, 1973, Metz.

        "brit": "Synagogue, also spelled synagog,  in Judaism, a community house of worship that serves as a place not only for liturgical services but also for assembly and study. Its traditional functions are reflected in three Hebrew synonyms for synagogue: bet ha-tefilla (\u201chouse of prayer\u201d), bet ha-kneset (\u201chouse of assembly\u201d), and bet ha-midrash (\u201chouse of study\u201d). The term synagogue is of Greek origin (synagein, \u201cto bring together\u201d) and means \u201ca place of assembly.\u201d The Yiddish word shul (from German Schule, \u201cschool\u201d) is also used to refer to the synagogue, and in modern times the word temple is common among some Reform and Conservative congregations.synagogueOrthodox synagogue in Ko\u0161ice, Slovakia.Marian Gladis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More on This Topic\nJudaism: The traditional pattern of synagogue practices\nThe other focus of observance is the synagogue. The origins of this institution are obscure, and a number of hypotheses have been proposed\u2026\n\n\n\nThe oldest dated evidence of a synagogue is from the 3rd century bce, but synagogues doubtless have an older history. Some scholars think that the destruction of Solomon\u2019s Temple of Jerusalem in 586 bce gave rise to synagogues after private homes were temporarily used for public worship and religious instruction.Interior of a synagogue.\u00a9 Stavchansky Yakov/Shutterstock.comOther scholars trace the origin of synagogues to the Jewish custom of having representatives of communities outside Jerusalem pray together during the two-week period when priestly representatives of their community attended ritual sacrifices in the Temple of Jerusalem.Whatever their origin, synagogues flourished side by side with the ancient Temple cult and existed long before Jewish sacrifice and the established priesthood were terminated with the destruction of the Second Temple by the Roman emperor Titus in 70 ce. Thereafter synagogues took on an even greater importance as the unchallenged focal point of Jewish religious life.\r\nGet exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription. \r\nSubscribe today\nLiterature of the 1st century ce refers to numerous synagogues not only in Palestine but also in Rome, Greece, Egypt, Babylonia, and Asia Minor. By the middle of that century, all sizable Jewish communities had a synagogue where regular morning, afternoon, and evening services were held, with special liturgies on the Sabbath and on religious festivals.Modern synagogues carry on the same basic functions associated with ancient synagogues but have added social, recreational, and philanthropic programs as the times demand. They are essentially democratic institutions established by a community of Jews who seek God through prayer and sacred studies. Since the liturgy has no sacrifice, no priesthood is required for public worship. Because each synagogue is autonomous, its erection, its maintenance, and its rabbi and officials reflect the desires of the local community.There is no standard synagogue architecture. A typical synagogue contains an ark (where the scrolls of the Law are kept), an \u201ceternal light\u201d burning before the ark, two candelabra, pews, and a raised platform (bimah), from which scriptural passages are read and from which, often, services are conducted. The segregation of men and women, a practice that is still observed in Orthodox synagogues, has been abandoned by Reform and Conservative congregations. A ritual bath (mikvah) is sometimes located on the premises. ",

        "wiki": "Metz ( METS, French: [m\u025bs] (listen), Lorraine Franconian: [m\u025bts]) Latin: Divodurum Mediomatricorum is a city in northeast France located at the confluence of the Moselle and the Seille rivers. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle department and the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region. Located near the tripoint along the junction of France, Germany, and Luxembourg, the city forms a central place of the European Greater Region and the SaarLorLux euroregion.Metz has a rich 3,000-year-history, having variously been a Celtic oppidum, an important Gallo-Roman city, the Merovingian capital of Austrasia, the birthplace of the Carolingian dynasty, a cradle of the Gregorian chant, and one of the oldest republics in Europe. The city has been steeped in Romance culture, but has been strongly influenced by Germanic culture due to its location and history.Because of its historical, cultural, and architectural background, Metz has been submitted on France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. The city features noteworthy buildings such as the Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral with its largest expanse of stained-glass windows in the world, the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains being the oldest church in France, its Imperial Station Palace displaying the apartment of the German Kaiser, or its Opera House, the oldest one working in France. Metz is home to some world-class venues including the Arsenal Concert Hall and the Centre Pompidou-Metz museum.\nA basin of urban ecology, Metz gained its nickname of The Green City (French: La Ville Verte), as it has extensive open grounds and public gardens. The historic city centre is one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France.A historic garrison town, Metz is the economic heart of the Lorraine region, specialising in information technology and automotive industries. Metz is home to the University of Lorraine, Georgia Tech Lorraine, and a centre for applied research and development in the materials sector, notably in metallurgy and metallography, the heritage of the Lorraine region's past in the iron and steel industry.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn ancient times, the town was known as \"city of Mediomatrici\", being inhabited by the tribe of the same name. After its integration into the Roman Empire, the city was called Divodurum Mediomatricum, meaning Holy Village or Holy Fortress of the Mediomatrici, then it was known as Mediomatrix. During the 5th century AD, the name evolved to \"Mettis\", which gave rise to Metz.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMetz has a recorded history dating back over 2,000 years. Before the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar in 52 BC, it was the oppidum of the Celtic Mediomatrici tribe. Integrated into the Roman Empire, Metz became quickly one of the principal towns of Gaul with a population of 40,000, until the barbarian depredations and its transfer to the Franks about the end of the 5th century. Between the 6th and 8th centuries, the city was the residence of the Merovingian kings of Austrasia. After the Treaty of Verdun in 843, Metz became the capital of the Kingdom of Lotharingia and was ultimately integrated into the Holy Roman Empire, being granted semi-independent status. During the 12th century, Metz became a republic and the Republic of Metz stood until the 15th century.With the signature of the Treaty of Chambord in 1552, Metz passed to the hands of the Kings of France. As the German Protestant Princes who traded Metz (alongside Toul and Verdun) for the promise of French military assistance, had no authority to cede territory of the Holy Roman Empire, the change of jurisdiction wasn't recognised by the Holy Roman Empire until the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. Under French rule, Metz was selected as capital of the Three Bishoprics and became a strategic fortified town. With creation of the departments by the Estates-General of 1789, Metz was chosen as capital of the Department of Moselle. Although French-speaking, after the Franco-Prussian War and according to the Treaty of Frankfurt of 1871, the city was annexed into the German Empire, being part of the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine and serving as capital of the Bezirk Lothringen.Metz remained German until the end of World War I, when it reverted to France. However, after the Battle of France during the Second World War, the city was annexed once more by the German Third Reich. In 1944, the attack on the city by the U.S. Third Army freed the city from German rule and Metz reverted one more time to France after World War II.During the 1950s, Metz was chosen to be the capital of the newly created Lorraine region. With the creation of the European Community and the later European Union, the city has become central to the Greater Region and the SaarLorLux Euroregion.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMetz is located on the banks of the Moselle and the Seille rivers, 43 km (26.7 mi) from the Schengen tripoint where the borders of France, Germany, and Luxembourg meet. The city was built in a place where many branches of the Moselle river creates several islands, which are encompassed within the urban planning.The terrain of Metz forms part of the Paris Basin and presents a plateau relief cut by river valleys presenting cuestas in the north\u2013south direction. Metz and its surrounding countryside are included in the forest and crop Lorraine Regional Natural Park, covering a total area of 205,000 ha (506,566.0 acres).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of Lorraine is a semi-continental climate. The summers are warm and humid, sometimes stormy, and the warmest month of the year is July, when daytime temperatures average approximately 25 \u00b0C (77.0 \u00b0F). The winters are cold and snowy with temperature dropping to an average low of \u22120.5 \u00b0C (31.1 \u00b0F) in January. Lows can be much colder through the night and early morning and the snowy period extends from November to February.The length of the day varies significantly over the course of the year. The shortest day is 21 December with 7:30 hours of sunlight; the longest day is 20 June with 16:30 hours of sunlight. The median cloud cover is 93% and does not vary substantially over the course of the year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nThe inhabitants of Metz are called Messin(e)s. Statistics on the ethnic and religious make up of the population of Metz are haphazard, as the French Republic prohibits making distinctions between citizens regarding race, beliefs, and political and philosophic opinions in the process of census taking. This would otherwise document the city to be a Germanic locale, as is the rest of the province and the neighboring Alsace.The French national census of 2012 estimated the population of Metz to be 119,551, while the population of Metz urban agglomeration was about 389,851. Through history, Metz's population has been impacted by the vicissitudes of the wars and annexations involving the city, which have prevented continuous population growth. More recently, the city has suffered from the restructuring of the military and the metallurgy industry. The historical population for the current area of Metz municipality is as follows:\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\nSeveral well-known figures have been linked to the city of Metz throughout its history. Renowned Messins include poet Paul Verlaine, composer Ambroise Thomas, and mathematician Jean-Victor Poncelet; numerous well-known German figures were also born in Metz notably during the annexation periods. Moreover, the city has been the residence of people such as writer Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Cardinal Mazarin, political thinker Alexis de Tocqueville, French patriot and American Revolutionary War hero Marquis Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette, and Luxembourg-born German-French statesman Robert Schuman.\n\n\n== Law and government ==\n\n\n=== Local law ===\n\nThe Local Law (French: droit local) applied in Metz is a legal system that operates in parallel with French law. Created in 1919, it preserves the French laws applied in France before 1870 and maintained by the Germans during the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, but repealed in the rest of France after 1871. It also maintains German laws enacted by the German Empire between 1871 and 1918, specific provisions adopted by the local authorities, and French laws that have been enacted after 1919 to be applicable only in Alsace-Lorraine. This specific local legislation encompasses different areas including religion, social work and finance.\nThe most striking of the legal differences between France and Alsace-Lorraine is the absence in Alsace-Lorraine of strict secularism, even though a constitutional right of freedom of religion is guaranteed by the French government. Alsace-Lorraine is still governed by a pre-1905 law established by the Concordat of 1801, which provides for the public subsidy of the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches and the Jewish religion.\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\nLike every commune of the present French Republic, Metz is managed by a mayor (French: maire) and a municipal council (French: conseil municipal), democratically elected by two-round proportional voting for six years. The mayor is assisted by 54 municipal councillors, and the municipal council is held on the last Thursday of every month. Since 2008, the mayor of Metz has been socialist Dominique Gros.The city belongs to the Metz Metropole union of cities, which includes the 40 cities of the Metz urban agglomeration. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle based in the former Intendant Palace. In addition, Metz is the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region, hosted in the former Saint-Clement Abbey.\n\n\n=== City administrative divisions ===\n\nThe city of Metz is divided into 14 administrative divisions:\n\n\n== Cityscape and environmental policy ==\n\nMetz contains a mishmash of architectural layers, bearing witness to centuries of history at the crossroads of different cultures, and features a number of architectural landmarks. The city possesses one of the largest Urban Conservation Areas in France, and more than 100 of the city's buildings are classified on the Monument Historique list. Because of its historical and cultural background, Metz is designated as French Town of Art and History, and has been submitted on to France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List.The city is famous for its yellow limestone architecture, a result of the extensive use of Jaumont stone. The historic district has kept part of the Gallo-Roman city with Divodurum's Cardo Maximus, then called Via Scarponensis (today the Trinitaires, Taison, and Serpenoise streets), and the Decumanus Maximus (today En Fournirue and d'Estr\u00e9es streets). At the Cardo and Decumanus intersection was situated the Roman forum, today the Saint-Jacques Square.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nFrom its Gallo-Roman past, the city preserves vestiges of the thermae (in the basement of the Golden Courtyard museum), parts of the aqueduct, and the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains.Saint Louis' square with its vaulted arcades and a Knights Templar chapel remains a major symbol of the city's High Medieval heritage. The Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral, several churches and H\u00f4tels, and two remarkable municipal granaries reflect the Late Middle Ages. Examples of Renaissance architecture can be seen in H\u00f4tels from the 16th century, such as the House of Heads (French: Maison des T\u00eates).The city hall and the buildings surrounding the town square are by French architect Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Blondel, who was awarded the task of redesigning and modernizing the centre of Metz by the Royal Academy of Architecture in 1755 the context of the Enlightenment. Neoclassical buildings from the 18th century, such as the Opera House, the Intendant Palace (the present-day prefecture), and the Royal Governor's Palace (the present-day courthouse) built by Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau, are also found in the city.The Imperial District was built during the first annexation of Metz by the German Empire. In order to \"germanise\" the city, Emperor Wilhelm II decided to create a new district shaped by a distinctive blend of Germanic architecture, including Renaissance, neo-Romanesque and neo-Classical, mixed with elements of Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Alsatian and mock-Bavarian styles. Instead of Jaumont stone, commonly used everywhere else in the city, stone used in the Rhineland, such as pink and grey sandstone, granite and basalt were used. The district features noteworthy buildings including the rail station and the Central Post Office by German architect J\u00fcrgen Kr\u00f6ger.Modern architecture can also be seen in the town with works of French architects Roger-Henri Expert (Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-de-l'Enfant-J\u00e9sus church, 1934), Georges-Henri Pingusson (Fire Station, 1960), and Jean Dubuisson (subdivisions, 1960s). The refurbishment of the former Ney Arsenal as a Concert Hall in 1989 and the erection of the Metz Arena in 2002, by Spanish and French architects Ricardo Bofill and French Paul Chemetov represent the Postmodern movement.The Centre Pompidou-Metz museum in the Amphitheatre District represents a strong architectural initiative to mark the entrance of Metz into the 21st century. Designed by Japanese architect Shigeru Ban, the building is remarkable for the complex, innovative carpentry of its roof, and integrates concepts of sustainable architecture. The project encompasses the architecture of two recipients of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, Shigeru Ban (2014) and French Christian de Portzamparc (1994). The Amphitheatre District is also conceived by French architects Nicolas Michelin, Jean-Paul Viguier, and Jean-Michel Wilmotte and designer Philippe Starck. The urban project is expected to be completed by 2023. Further, a contemporary music venue designed by contextualist French architect Rudy Ricciotti stands in the Borny District.\n\n\n=== Urban ecology ===\n\nUnder the leadership of such people as botanist Jean-Marie Pelt, Metz pioneered a policy of urban ecology during the early 1970s. Because of the failure of post-war urban planning and housing estate development in Europe during the 1960s, mostly based on the concepts of CIAM, Jean-Marie Pelt, then municipal councillor of Metz, initiated a new approach to the urban environment.Based initially on the ideas of the Chicago School, Pelt's theories pleaded for better integration of humans into their environment and developed a concept centered on the relationship between \"stone and water\". His policy was realized in Metz by the establishment of extensive open areas surrounding the Moselle and the Seille rivers and the development of large pedestrian areas. As a result, Metz has over 37 m2 (400 sq ft) of open areas per inhabitant in the form of numerous public gardens in the city.The principles of urban ecology are still applied in Metz with the implementation of a local Agenda 21 action plan. The municipal ecological policy encompasses the sustainable refurbishment of ancient buildings, the erection of sustainable districts and buildings, green public transport, and the creation of public gardens by means of landscape architecture.Additionally, the city has developed its own combined heat and power station, using waste wood biomass from the surrounding forests as a renewable energy source. With a thermal efficiency above 80%, the 45MW boiler of the plant provides electricity and heat for 44,000 dwellings. The Metz power station is the first local producer and distributor of energy in France.\n\n\n=== Military architecture ===\n\nAs a historic Garrison town, Metz has been heavily influenced by military architecture throughout its history. From ancient history to the present, the city has been successively fortified and modified to accommodate the troops stationed there. Defensive walls from classical antiquity to the 20th century are still visible today, incorporated into the design of public gardens along the Moselle and Seille rivers. A medieval bridge castle from the 13th century, named Germans' Gate (French: Porte des Allemands), today converted into a convention and exhibition centre, has become one of the landmarks of the city. It is still possible to see parts of the 16th century citadel, as well as fortifications built in the 1740s by Louis de Cormontaigne but based on designs by Vauban. Important barracks, mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries, are spread around the city: some, which are of architectural interest, have been converted to civilian use, such as the Arsenal Concert Hall by Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill.\nThe extensive fortifications of Metz, which ring the city, include early examples of S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res system forts. Other forts were incorporated into the Maginot Line. A hiking trail on the Saint-Quentin plateau passes through a former military training zone and ends at the now abandoned military forts, providing a vantage point from which to survey the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAlthough the steel industry has historically dominated Moselle's economy, Metz's efforts at economic diversification have created a base in the sectors of commerce, tourism, information technology and the automotive industry. The city is the economic heart of the Lorraine region and around 73,000 people work daily within the urban agglomeration. The transport facilities found in the conurbation, including the international high-speed railway, motorway, inland connections and the local bus rapid transit system, have made the city a transport hub in the heart of the European Union. Metz is home to the biggest harbour handling cereals in France with over 4,000,000 tons/year.Metz is home to the Moselle Chamber of Commerce. International companies such as PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, ArcelorMittal, SFR, and TDF have established plants and centres in the Metz conurbation. Metz is also the regional headquarters of the Caisse d'Epargne and Banque Populaire banking groups.\nMetz is an important commercial centre of northern France with France's biggest retailer federation, consisting of around 2,000 retailers. Important retail companies are found in the city, such as the Galeries Lafayette, the Printemps department store and the Fnac entertainment retail chain. The historic city centre displays one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France and a mall, the Saint-Jacques centre. In addition there are several multiplex movie theatres and malls found in the urban agglomeration.\nIn recent years, Metz municipality have promoted an ambitious policy of tourism development, including urban revitalization and refurbishment of buildings and public squares. This policy has been spurred by the creation of the Centre Pompidou-Metz in 2010. Since its inauguration, the institution has become the most popular cultural venue in France outside Paris, with 550,000 visitors per year. Meanwhile, Saint-Stephen Cathedral is the most visited building in the city, accommodating 652,000 visitors per year.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums and exhibition halls ===\n\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz is a museum of modern and contemporary arts, the largest temporary exhibition area in France outside Paris. The museum features exhibitions from the extensive collection of the Centre Pompidou, Europe's largest collection of 20th-century art.\nSaint Stephen's Cathedral is the Gothic cathedral of the city built during the 13th century. The cathedral exhibits the collection of the Bishopric of Metz, including paraments and items used in the service of the Eucharist. Metz Cathedral is sometimes nicknamed the Good Lord's Lantern (French: la Lanterne du Bon Dieu), as it has the largest expanse of stained glass windows in the world: 6,500 m2 (70,000 sq ft). These include works by Gothic and Renaissance master glass makers Hermann von M\u00fcnster, Th\u00e9obald of Lixheim, and Valentin Bousch, romantic Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, tachist Roger Bissi\u00e8re, cubist Jacques Villon and modernist Marc Chagall.\nAnother of the city's churches displays a complete set of stained glass windows by French modernist Jean Cocteau.In addition, Metz features other museums and exhibition venues, such as:\n\nThe FRAC Lorraine, a public collection of contemporary art of the Lorraine region. It is located in the 12th-century Saint-Liver H\u00f4tel and organizes exhibitions of local and international contemporary artists.\nThe Golden Courtyard (French: la Cour d'Or), a museum dedicated to the history of Metz, divided into four sections (e.g. archeology, medieval, architecture, and fine arts). The Golden Courtyard displays a rich collection of Gallo-Roman and medieval finds and the remains of the Gallo-Roman baths of Divodurum Mediomatricum, revealed by the extension works to the museums in the 1930s.\nThe Museum of the 1870 War and of the Annexion in Gravelotte, a village located within the Metz-Metropole conurbation and the site of the Battle of Gravelotte, the only museum in Europe dedicated to the Franco-Prussian War. The museum exhibits military and everyday items from the period as well as artworks related to the 1870 war. A mausoleum erected in 1904 honoring the soldiers who died during the battle, the Memorial Hall (French: La Halle du Souvenir), has been included in the museum.\nThe House for Europe, located on the estate of Robert Schuman in Scy-Chazelles in the Metz-Metropole conurbation, transformed into a museum and convention centre. Across the street is the fortified 12th Century church where Robert Schuman now rests. The Robert Schuman House for Europe organises cultural and educational events that introduce the visitor to Schuman's life and works and to the way Europe has been constructed and continues to develop today.\nVerlaine's House (French: la Maison de Verlaine) is a museum located in the house where the poet Paul Verlaine was born, dedicated to his work, featuring permanent and temporary exhibitions. The Solange Bertrand foundation, located in the artist's former house, conserves and displays her artworks. The municipal archives preserve and exhibit Metz's historical municipal records dating from medieval times to the present.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\nMetz has several venues for the performing arts. The Opera House of Metz, the oldest working opera house in France, features plays, dance, and lyric poetry. The Arsenal Concert Hall, dedicated to art music, is widely renowned for its excellent acoustics. The Trinitarians Club is a multi-media arts complex housed in the vaulted cellar and chapel of an ancient convent, the city's prime venue for jazz music. The Music Box (French: Boite \u00e0 Musique), familiarly known as BAM, is the concert venue dedicated to rock and electronic music. The Braun Hall and the Kolt\u00e8s Theater feature plays, and the city has two movie theaters specializing in Auteur cinema. The Saint-Jacques Square, surrounded by busy bars and pubs whose open-air tables fill the centre of the square.\nSince 2014, the former bus garage has been converted to accommodate over thirty artists in residence, in a space where they can create and rehearse artworks and even build set decorations. The artistic complex, called Metz Network of All Cultures (French: Toutes les Cultures en R\u00e9seau \u00e0 Metz) and familiarly known as TCRM-Blida, encompasses a large hall of 3,000 m2 (32,000 sq ft) while theater and dance companies benefit from a studio of 800 m2 (8,600 sq ft) with backstages.\n\n\n=== Metz in the arts ===\nMetz was an important cultural centre during the Carolingian Renaissance. For instance, Gregorian chant was created in Metz during the 8th century as a fusion of Gallican and ancient Roman repertory. Then called Messin Chant, it remains the oldest form of music still in use in Western Europe. The bishops of Metz, notably Saint-Chrodegang promoted its use for the Roman liturgy in Gallic lands under the favorable influence of the Carolingian monarchs. Messin chant made two major contributions to the body of chant: it fitted the chant into the ancient Greek octoechos system, and invented an innovative musical notation, using neumes to show the shape of a remembered melody. Metz was also an important centre of illumination of Carolingian manuscripts, producing such monuments of Carolingian book illumination as the Drogo Sacramentary.The Metz School (French: \u00c9cole de Metz) was an art movement in Metz and the region between 1834 and 1870, centred on Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal. The term was originally proposed in 1845 by the poet Charles Baudelaire, who appreciated the works of the artists. They were influenced by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix and inspired by the medieval heritage of Metz and its romantic surroundings. The Franco-Prussian War and the annexation of the territory by the Germans resulted in the dismantling of the movement. The main figures of the Metz School were Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, Auguste Migette, Auguste Hussenot, Louis-Th\u00e9odore Devilly, Christopher Fratin, and Charles P\u00eatre. Their works include paintings, engravings, drawings, stained-glass windows, and sculptures.\nA festival named \"passages\" takes place in May. Numerous shows are presented to it.\n\n\n=== The Graoully dragon as symbol of the city ===\n\nThe Graoully is depicted as a fearsome dragon, vanquished by the sacred powers of Saint Clement of Metz, the first Bishop of the city. The Graoully quickly became a symbol of Metz and can be seen in numerous insignia of the city, from the 10th century on. Writers from Metz tend to present the legend as an allegory of Christianity's victory over paganism, represented by the harmful dragon.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nLocal specialties include the quiche, the pot\u00e9e, the Lorrain p\u00e2t\u00e9, and also suckling pig. Different recipes, such as jam, tart, charcuterie and fruit brandy, are made from the Mirabelle and Damson plums. Also, Metz is the cradle of some pastries like the Metz cheese pie and the Metz Balls (French: boulet de Metz), a ganache-stuffed biscuit coated with marzipan, caramel, and dark chocolate. Local beverages include Moselle wine and Amos beer.The Covered Market of Metz is one of the oldest, most grandiose in France and is home to traditional local food producers and retailers. Originally built as the bishop's palace, the French Revolution broke out before the Bishop of Metz could move in and the citizens decided to turn it into a food market. The adjacent Chamber's Square (French: Place de la Chambre) is surrounded by numerous local food restaurants.\n\n\n=== Celebrations and events ===\nMany events are celebrated in Metz throughout the year. The city of Metz dedicates two weeks to the Mirabelle plum during the popular Mirabelle Festival held in August. During the festival, in addition to open markets selling fresh plums, mirabelle tarts, and mirabelle liquor, there are live music, fireworks, parties, art exhibits, a parade with floral floats, a competition, the crowning of the Mirabelle Queen and a gala of celebration.A literature festival is held in June. The Montgolfiades hot air balloon festival is organized in September. The second most popular Christmas Market in France is held in November and December. Finally, a Saint Nicholas parade honors the patron saint of the Lorraine region in December.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nMetz is home to the Football Club of Metz (FC Metz), a football association club in Ligue 1, the highest division of French football (as of 2019\u20132020 season). FC Metz has won three times the Ligue 2 (1935, 2007, and 2014), twice the Coupe de France (in 1984 and 1988) and the French League Cup (in 1986 and 1996), and was French championship runner-up in 1998. FC Metz has also gained recognition in France and Europe for its successful youth academy, winning the Gambardella Cup 3 times in 1981, 2001, and 2010.

In 1996, the engineering school Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech (ENSAM) built a research and learning center next to the golf course. This opened the way to the development of a new area, where the Franco-German university (ISFATES) and the ENIM moved in 2010. These graduate schools often cooperate with the University of Lorraine.

        "wiki": "Metz ( METS, French: [m\u025bs] (listen), Lorraine Franconian: [m\u025bts]) Latin: Divodurum Mediomatricorum is a city in northeast France located at the confluence of the Moselle and the Seille rivers. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle department and the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region. Located near the tripoint along the junction of France, Germany, and Luxembourg, the city forms a central place of the European Greater Region and the SaarLorLux euroregion.Metz has a rich 3,000-year-history, having variously been a Celtic oppidum, an important Gallo-Roman city, the Merovingian capital of Austrasia, the birthplace of the Carolingian dynasty, a cradle of the Gregorian chant, and one of the oldest republics in Europe. The city has been steeped in Romance culture, but has been strongly influenced by Germanic culture due to its location and history.Because of its historical, cultural, and architectural background, Metz has been submitted on France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. The city features noteworthy buildings such as the Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral with its largest expanse of stained-glass windows in the world, the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains being the oldest church in France, its Imperial Station Palace displaying the apartment of the German Kaiser, or its Opera House, the oldest one working in France. Metz is home to some world-class venues including the Arsenal Concert Hall and the Centre Pompidou-Metz museum.\nA basin of urban ecology, Metz gained its nickname of The Green City (French: La Ville Verte), as it has extensive open grounds and public gardens. The historic city centre is one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France.A historic garrison town, Metz is the economic heart of the Lorraine region, specialising in information technology and automotive industries. Metz is home to the University of Lorraine, Georgia Tech Lorraine, and a centre for applied research and development in the materials sector, notably in metallurgy and metallography, the heritage of the Lorraine region's past in the iron and steel industry.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn ancient times, the town was known as \"city of Mediomatrici\", being inhabited by the tribe of the same name. After its integration into the Roman Empire, the city was called Divodurum Mediomatricum, meaning Holy Village or Holy Fortress of the Mediomatrici, then it was known as Mediomatrix. During the 5th century AD, the name evolved to \"Mettis\", which gave rise to Metz.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMetz has a recorded history dating back over 2,000 years. Before the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar in 52 BC, it was the oppidum of the Celtic Mediomatrici tribe. Integrated into the Roman Empire, Metz became quickly one of the principal towns of Gaul with a population of 40,000, until the barbarian depredations and its transfer to the Franks about the end of the 5th century. Between the 6th and 8th centuries, the city was the residence of the Merovingian kings of Austrasia. After the Treaty of Verdun in 843, Metz became the capital of the Kingdom of Lotharingia and was ultimately integrated into the Holy Roman Empire, being granted semi-independent status. During the 12th century, Metz became a republic and the Republic of Metz stood until the 15th century.With the signature of the Treaty of Chambord in 1552, Metz passed to the hands of the Kings of France. As the German Protestant Princes who traded Metz (alongside Toul and Verdun) for the promise of French military assistance, had no authority to cede territory of the Holy Roman Empire, the change of jurisdiction wasn't recognised by the Holy Roman Empire until the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. Under French rule, Metz was selected as capital of the Three Bishoprics and became a strategic fortified town. With creation of the departments by the Estates-General of 1789, Metz was chosen as capital of the Department of Moselle. Although French-speaking, after the Franco-Prussian War and according to the Treaty of Frankfurt of 1871, the city was annexed into the German Empire, being part of the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine and serving as capital of the Bezirk Lothringen.Metz remained German until the end of World War I, when it reverted to France. However, after the Battle of France during the Second World War, the city was annexed once more by the German Third Reich. In 1944, the attack on the city by the U.S. Third Army freed the city from German rule and Metz reverted one more time to France after World War II.During the 1950s, Metz was chosen to be the capital of the newly created Lorraine region. With the creation of the European Community and the later European Union, the city has become central to the Greater Region and the SaarLorLux Euroregion.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMetz is located on the banks of the Moselle and the Seille rivers, 43 km (26.7 mi) from the Schengen tripoint where the borders of France, Germany, and Luxembourg meet. The city was built in a place where many branches of the Moselle river creates several islands, which are encompassed within the urban planning.The terrain of Metz forms part of the Paris Basin and presents a plateau relief cut by river valleys presenting cuestas in the north\u2013south direction. Metz and its surrounding countryside are included in the forest and crop Lorraine Regional Natural Park, covering a total area of 205,000 ha (506,566.0 acres).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of Lorraine is a semi-continental climate. The summers are warm and humid, sometimes stormy, and the warmest month of the year is July, when daytime temperatures average approximately 25 \u00b0C (77.0 \u00b0F). The winters are cold and snowy with temperature dropping to an average low of \u22120.5 \u00b0C (31.1 \u00b0F) in January. Lows can be much colder through the night and early morning and the snowy period extends from November to February.The length of the day varies significantly over the course of the year. The shortest day is 21 December with 7:30 hours of sunlight; the longest day is 20 June with 16:30 hours of sunlight. The median cloud cover is 93% and does not vary substantially over the course of the year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nThe inhabitants of Metz are called Messin(e)s. Statistics on the ethnic and religious make up of the population of Metz are haphazard, as the French Republic prohibits making distinctions between citizens regarding race, beliefs, and political and philosophic opinions in the process of census taking. This would otherwise document the city to be a Germanic locale, as is the rest of the province and the neighboring Alsace.The French national census of 2012 estimated the population of Metz to be 119,551, while the population of Metz urban agglomeration was about 389,851. Through history, Metz's population has been impacted by the vicissitudes of the wars and annexations involving the city, which have prevented continuous population growth. More recently, the city has suffered from the restructuring of the military and the metallurgy industry. The historical population for the current area of Metz municipality is as follows:\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\nSeveral well-known figures have been linked to the city of Metz throughout its history. Renowned Messins include poet Paul Verlaine, composer Ambroise Thomas, and mathematician Jean-Victor Poncelet; numerous well-known German figures were also born in Metz notably during the annexation periods. Moreover, the city has been the residence of people such as writer Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Cardinal Mazarin, political thinker Alexis de Tocqueville, French patriot and American Revolutionary War hero Marquis Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette, and Luxembourg-born German-French statesman Robert Schuman.\n\n\n== Law and government ==\n\n\n=== Local law ===\n\nThe Local Law (French: droit local) applied in Metz is a legal system that operates in parallel with French law. Created in 1919, it preserves the French laws applied in France before 1870 and maintained by the Germans during the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, but repealed in the rest of France after 1871. It also maintains German laws enacted by the German Empire between 1871 and 1918, specific provisions adopted by the local authorities, and French laws that have been enacted after 1919 to be applicable only in Alsace-Lorraine. This specific local legislation encompasses different areas including religion, social work and finance.\nThe most striking of the legal differences between France and Alsace-Lorraine is the absence in Alsace-Lorraine of strict secularism, even though a constitutional right of freedom of religion is guaranteed by the French government. Alsace-Lorraine is still governed by a pre-1905 law established by the Concordat of 1801, which provides for the public subsidy of the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches and the Jewish religion.\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\nLike every commune of the present French Republic, Metz is managed by a mayor (French: maire) and a municipal council (French: conseil municipal), democratically elected by two-round proportional voting for six years. The mayor is assisted by 54 municipal councillors, and the municipal council is held on the last Thursday of every month. Since 2008, the mayor of Metz has been socialist Dominique Gros.The city belongs to the Metz Metropole union of cities, which includes the 40 cities of the Metz urban agglomeration. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle based in the former Intendant Palace. In addition, Metz is the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region, hosted in the former Saint-Clement Abbey.\n\n\n=== City administrative divisions ===\n\nThe city of Metz is divided into 14 administrative divisions:\n\n\n== Cityscape and environmental policy ==\n\nMetz contains a mishmash of architectural layers, bearing witness to centuries of history at the crossroads of different cultures, and features a number of architectural landmarks. The city possesses one of the largest Urban Conservation Areas in France, and more than 100 of the city's buildings are classified on the Monument Historique list. Because of its historical and cultural background, Metz is designated as French Town of Art and History, and has been submitted on to France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List.The city is famous for its yellow limestone architecture, a result of the extensive use of Jaumont stone. The historic district has kept part of the Gallo-Roman city with Divodurum's Cardo Maximus, then called Via Scarponensis (today the Trinitaires, Taison, and Serpenoise streets), and the Decumanus Maximus (today En Fournirue and d'Estr\u00e9es streets). At the Cardo and Decumanus intersection was situated the Roman forum, today the Saint-Jacques Square.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nFrom its Gallo-Roman past, the city preserves vestiges of the thermae (in the basement of the Golden Courtyard museum), parts of the aqueduct, and the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains.Saint Louis' square with its vaulted arcades and a Knights Templar chapel remains a major symbol of the city's High Medieval heritage. The Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral, several churches and H\u00f4tels, and two remarkable municipal granaries reflect the Late Middle Ages. Examples of Renaissance architecture can be seen in H\u00f4tels from the 16th century, such as the House of Heads (French: Maison des T\u00eates).The city hall and the buildings surrounding the town square are by French architect Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Blondel, who was awarded the task of redesigning and modernizing the centre of Metz by the Royal Academy of Architecture in 1755 the context of the Enlightenment. Neoclassical buildings from the 18th century, such as the Opera House, the Intendant Palace (the present-day prefecture), and the Royal Governor's Palace (the present-day courthouse) built by Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau, are also found in the city.The Imperial District was built during the first annexation of Metz by the German Empire. In order to \"germanise\" the city, Emperor Wilhelm II decided to create a new district shaped by a distinctive blend of Germanic architecture, including Renaissance, neo-Romanesque and neo-Classical, mixed with elements of Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Alsatian and mock-Bavarian styles. Instead of Jaumont stone, commonly used everywhere else in the city, stone used in the Rhineland, such as pink and grey sandstone, granite and basalt were used. The district features noteworthy buildings including the rail station and the Central Post Office by German architect J\u00fcrgen Kr\u00f6ger.Modern architecture can also be seen in the town with works of French architects Roger-Henri Expert (Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-de-l'Enfant-J\u00e9sus church, 1934), Georges-Henri Pingusson (Fire Station, 1960), and Jean Dubuisson (subdivisions, 1960s). The refurbishment of the former Ney Arsenal as a Concert Hall in 1989 and the erection of the Metz Arena in 2002, by Spanish and French architects Ricardo Bofill and French Paul Chemetov represent the Postmodern movement.The Centre Pompidou-Metz museum in the Amphitheatre District represents a strong architectural initiative to mark the entrance of Metz into the 21st century. Designed by Japanese architect Shigeru Ban, the building is remarkable for the complex, innovative carpentry of its roof, and integrates concepts of sustainable architecture. The project encompasses the architecture of two recipients of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, Shigeru Ban (2014) and French Christian de Portzamparc (1994). The Amphitheatre District is also conceived by French architects Nicolas Michelin, Jean-Paul Viguier, and Jean-Michel Wilmotte and designer Philippe Starck. The urban project is expected to be completed by 2023. Further, a contemporary music venue designed by contextualist French architect Rudy Ricciotti stands in the Borny District.\n\n\n=== Urban ecology ===\n\nUnder the leadership of such people as botanist Jean-Marie Pelt, Metz pioneered a policy of urban ecology during the early 1970s. Because of the failure of post-war urban planning and housing estate development in Europe during the 1960s, mostly based on the concepts of CIAM, Jean-Marie Pelt, then municipal councillor of Metz, initiated a new approach to the urban environment.Based initially on the ideas of the Chicago School, Pelt's theories pleaded for better integration of humans into their environment and developed a concept centered on the relationship between \"stone and water\". His policy was realized in Metz by the establishment of extensive open areas surrounding the Moselle and the Seille rivers and the development of large pedestrian areas. As a result, Metz has over 37 m2 (400 sq ft) of open areas per inhabitant in the form of numerous public gardens in the city.The principles of urban ecology are still applied in Metz with the implementation of a local Agenda 21 action plan. The municipal ecological policy encompasses the sustainable refurbishment of ancient buildings, the erection of sustainable districts and buildings, green public transport, and the creation of public gardens by means of landscape architecture.Additionally, the city has developed its own combined heat and power station, using waste wood biomass from the surrounding forests as a renewable energy source. With a thermal efficiency above 80%, the 45MW boiler of the plant provides electricity and heat for 44,000 dwellings. The Metz power station is the first local producer and distributor of energy in France.\n\n\n=== Military architecture ===\n\nAs a historic Garrison town, Metz has been heavily influenced by military architecture throughout its history. From ancient history to the present, the city has been successively fortified and modified to accommodate the troops stationed there. Defensive walls from classical antiquity to the 20th century are still visible today, incorporated into the design of public gardens along the Moselle and Seille rivers. A medieval bridge castle from the 13th century, named Germans' Gate (French: Porte des Allemands), today converted into a convention and exhibition centre, has become one of the landmarks of the city. It is still possible to see parts of the 16th century citadel, as well as fortifications built in the 1740s by Louis de Cormontaigne but based on designs by Vauban. Important barracks, mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries, are spread around the city: some, which are of architectural interest, have been converted to civilian use, such as the Arsenal Concert Hall by Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill.\nThe extensive fortifications of Metz, which ring the city, include early examples of S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res system forts. Other forts were incorporated into the Maginot Line. A hiking trail on the Saint-Quentin plateau passes through a former military training zone and ends at the now abandoned military forts, providing a vantage point from which to survey the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAlthough the steel industry has historically dominated Moselle's economy, Metz's efforts at economic diversification have created a base in the sectors of commerce, tourism, information technology and the automotive industry. The city is the economic heart of the Lorraine region and around 73,000 people work daily within the urban agglomeration. The transport facilities found in the conurbation, including the international high-speed railway, motorway, inland connections and the local bus rapid transit system, have made the city a transport hub in the heart of the European Union. Metz is home to the biggest harbour handling cereals in France with over 4,000,000 tons/year.Metz is home to the Moselle Chamber of Commerce. International companies such as PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, ArcelorMittal, SFR, and TDF have established plants and centres in the Metz conurbation. Metz is also the regional headquarters of the Caisse d'Epargne and Banque Populaire banking groups.\nMetz is an important commercial centre of northern France with France's biggest retailer federation, consisting of around 2,000 retailers. Important retail companies are found in the city, such as the Galeries Lafayette, the Printemps department store and the Fnac entertainment retail chain. The historic city centre displays one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France and a mall, the Saint-Jacques centre. In addition there are several multiplex movie theatres and malls found in the urban agglomeration.\nIn recent years, Metz municipality have promoted an ambitious policy of tourism development, including urban revitalization and refurbishment of buildings and public squares. This policy has been spurred by the creation of the Centre Pompidou-Metz in 2010. Since its inauguration, the institution has become the most popular cultural venue in France outside Paris, with 550,000 visitors per year. Meanwhile, Saint-Stephen Cathedral is the most visited building in the city, accommodating 652,000 visitors per year.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums and exhibition halls ===\n\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz is a museum of modern and contemporary arts, the largest temporary exhibition area in France outside Paris. The museum features exhibitions from the extensive collection of the Centre Pompidou, Europe's largest collection of 20th-century art.\nSaint Stephen's Cathedral is the Gothic cathedral of the city built during the 13th century. The cathedral exhibits the collection of the Bishopric of Metz, including paraments and items used in the service of the Eucharist. Metz Cathedral is sometimes nicknamed the Good Lord's Lantern (French: la Lanterne du Bon Dieu), as it has the largest expanse of stained glass windows in the world: 6,500 m2 (70,000 sq ft). These include works by Gothic and Renaissance master glass makers Hermann von M\u00fcnster, Th\u00e9obald of Lixheim, and Valentin Bousch, romantic Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, tachist Roger Bissi\u00e8re, cubist Jacques Villon and modernist Marc Chagall.\nAnother of the city's churches displays a complete set of stained glass windows by French modernist Jean Cocteau.In addition, Metz features other museums and exhibition venues, such as:\n\nThe FRAC Lorraine, a public collection of contemporary art of the Lorraine region. It is located in the 12th-century Saint-Liver H\u00f4tel and organizes exhibitions of local and international contemporary artists.\nThe Golden Courtyard (French: la Cour d'Or), a museum dedicated to the history of Metz, divided into four sections (e.g. archeology, medieval, architecture, and fine arts). The Golden Courtyard displays a rich collection of Gallo-Roman and medieval finds and the remains of the Gallo-Roman baths of Divodurum Mediomatricum, revealed by the extension works to the museums in the 1930s.\nThe Museum of the 1870 War and of the Annexion in Gravelotte, a village located within the Metz-Metropole conurbation and the site of the Battle of Gravelotte, the only museum in Europe dedicated to the Franco-Prussian War. The museum exhibits military and everyday items from the period as well as artworks related to the 1870 war. A mausoleum erected in 1904 honoring the soldiers who died during the battle, the Memorial Hall (French: La Halle du Souvenir), has been included in the museum.\nThe House for Europe, located on the estate of Robert Schuman in Scy-Chazelles in the Metz-Metropole conurbation, transformed into a museum and convention centre. Across the street is the fortified 12th Century church where Robert Schuman now rests. The Robert Schuman House for Europe organises cultural and educational events that introduce the visitor to Schuman's life and works and to the way Europe has been constructed and continues to develop today.\nVerlaine's House (French: la Maison de Verlaine) is a museum located in the house where the poet Paul Verlaine was born, dedicated to his work, featuring permanent and temporary exhibitions. The Solange Bertrand foundation, located in the artist's former house, conserves and displays her artworks. The municipal archives preserve and exhibit Metz's historical municipal records dating from medieval times to the present.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\nMetz has several venues for the performing arts. The Opera House of Metz, the oldest working opera house in France, features plays, dance, and lyric poetry. The Arsenal Concert Hall, dedicated to art music, is widely renowned for its excellent acoustics. The Trinitarians Club is a multi-media arts complex housed in the vaulted cellar and chapel of an ancient convent, the city's prime venue for jazz music. The Music Box (French: Boite \u00e0 Musique), familiarly known as BAM, is the concert venue dedicated to rock and electronic music. The Braun Hall and the Kolt\u00e8s Theater feature plays, and the city has two movie theaters specializing in Auteur cinema. The Saint-Jacques Square, surrounded by busy bars and pubs whose open-air tables fill the centre of the square.\nSince 2014, the former bus garage has been converted to accommodate over thirty artists in residence, in a space where they can create and rehearse artworks and even build set decorations. The artistic complex, called Metz Network of All Cultures (French: Toutes les Cultures en R\u00e9seau \u00e0 Metz) and familiarly known as TCRM-Blida, encompasses a large hall of 3,000 m2 (32,000 sq ft) while theater and dance companies benefit from a studio of 800 m2 (8,600 sq ft) with backstages.\n\n\n=== Metz in the arts ===\nMetz was an important cultural centre during the Carolingian Renaissance. For instance, Gregorian chant was created in Metz during the 8th century as a fusion of Gallican and ancient Roman repertory. Then called Messin Chant, it remains the oldest form of music still in use in Western Europe. The bishops of Metz, notably Saint-Chrodegang promoted its use for the Roman liturgy in Gallic lands under the favorable influence of the Carolingian monarchs. Messin chant made two major contributions to the body of chant: it fitted the chant into the ancient Greek octoechos system, and invented an innovative musical notation, using neumes to show the shape of a remembered melody. Metz was also an important centre of illumination of Carolingian manuscripts, producing such monuments of Carolingian book illumination as the Drogo Sacramentary.The Metz School (French: \u00c9cole de Metz) was an art movement in Metz and the region between 1834 and 1870, centred on Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal. The term was originally proposed in 1845 by the poet Charles Baudelaire, who appreciated the works of the artists. They were influenced by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix and inspired by the medieval heritage of Metz and its romantic surroundings. The Franco-Prussian War and the annexation of the territory by the Germans resulted in the dismantling of the movement. The main figures of the Metz School were Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, Auguste Migette, Auguste Hussenot, Louis-Th\u00e9odore Devilly, Christopher Fratin, and Charles P\u00eatre. Their works include paintings, engravings, drawings, stained-glass windows, and sculptures.\nA festival named \"passages\" takes place in May. Numerous shows are presented to it.\n\n\n=== The Graoully dragon as symbol of the city ===\n\nThe Graoully is depicted as a fearsome dragon, vanquished by the sacred powers of Saint Clement of Metz, the first Bishop of the city. The Graoully quickly became a symbol of Metz and can be seen in numerous insignia of the city, from the 10th century on. Writers from Metz tend to present the legend as an allegory of Christianity's victory over paganism, represented by the harmful dragon.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nLocal specialties include the quiche, the pot\u00e9e, the Lorrain p\u00e2t\u00e9, and also suckling pig. Different recipes, such as jam, tart, charcuterie and fruit brandy, are made from the Mirabelle and Damson plums. Also, Metz is the cradle of some pastries like the Metz cheese pie and the Metz Balls (French: boulet de Metz), a ganache-stuffed biscuit coated with marzipan, caramel, and dark chocolate. Local beverages include Moselle wine and Amos beer.The Covered Market of Metz is one of the oldest, most grandiose in France and is home to traditional local food producers and retailers. Originally built as the bishop's palace, the French Revolution broke out before the Bishop of Metz could move in and the citizens decided to turn it into a food market. The adjacent Chamber's Square (French: Place de la Chambre) is surrounded by numerous local food restaurants.\n\n\n=== Celebrations and events ===\nMany events are celebrated in Metz throughout the year. The city of Metz dedicates two weeks to the Mirabelle plum during the popular Mirabelle Festival held in August. During the festival, in addition to open markets selling fresh plums, mirabelle tarts, and mirabelle liquor, there are live music, fireworks, parties, art exhibits, a parade with floral floats, a competition, the crowning of the Mirabelle Queen and a gala of celebration.A literature festival is held in June. The Montgolfiades hot air balloon festival is organized in September. The second most popular Christmas Market in France is held in November and December. Finally, a Saint Nicholas parade honors the patron saint of the Lorraine region in December.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nMetz is home to the Football Club of Metz (FC Metz), a football association club in Ligue 1, the highest division of French football (as of 2019\u20132020 season). FC Metz has won three times the Ligue 2 (1935, 2007, and 2014), twice the Coupe de France (in 1984 and 1988) and the French League Cup (in 1986 and 1996), and was French championship runner-up in 1998. FC Metz has also gained recognition in France and Europe for its successful youth academy, winning the Gambardella Cup 3 times in 1981, 2001, and 2010. The Saint-Symphorien stadium has been the home of FC Metz since the creation of the club.\nMetz Handball is a Handball club. Metz Handball has won the French Women's First League championship 23 times, the Women's France Cup nine times, and the French Women's League Cup eight times. The Metz Arena has been the home of Metz Handball since 2002.\nSince 2003, Metz has been home to the Moselle Open, an ATP World Tour 250 tournament played on indoor hard courts, which usually takes place in September.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== High schools ===\nMetz has numerous high schools, including the Fabert High School and the Lyc\u00e9e of Communication. Some of these institutions offer higher education programs such as classes pr\u00e9paratoires (undergraduate school) or BTS (technician certificate).\n\n\n=== University of Lorraine ===\n\nMetz is also home to the University of Lorraine (often abbreviated as UdL).  \nThe university is divided into two university centers, one in Metz (material sciences, technology, and management) and one in Nancy (biological sciences, health care, administration, and management). The University of Lorraine, which ranks in 2016 among the top 15 of French universities and among the top 300 of universities in the world according to the 2016 Academic Ranking of World Universities, \n has a student body of over 55,000 and offers 101 accredited research centers organized in 9 research areas and 8 doctoral colleges.\n\n\n=== Graduate schools ===\nAt the end of the 1990s, the city expanded and the Metz Science Park was created in the southern area. Along with this expansion, several graduate schools took the opportunity to establish campuses in the park. At first, facilities were grouped around the lake Symphony, like Sup\u00e9lec in 1985 and Georgia Tech Lorraine in 1990. In 1996, the engineering school Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech (ENSAM) built a research and learning center next to the golf course. This opened the way to the development of a new area, where the Franco-German university (ISFATES) and the ENIM moved in 2010. These graduate schools often cooperate with the University of Lorraine.

        "wiki": "The Jardin botanique de Metz, also known as the Jardin botanique de la Ville de Metz, is a 4.4-hectare (11-acre) botanical garden located at 27 ter, rue du Pont-\u00e0-Mousson, Montigny-l\u00e8s-Metz, Moselle, Grand Est, France. It is open daily; admission is free.\nThe garden was originally known as Frescatelly Park, an estate of Philippe d'Aubertin of Bionville, whose summer pavilion (built 1719) currently houses the directorate of the Department of Parks. It was purchased by the city of Metz in 1866 and landscaped primarily in the English style by city architect Demoget. Its greenhouses were originally built on the city's esplanade in 1861, during the World Fair, and moved to the Botanical Garden in 1880.\nToday the garden contains a rose garden (80 varieties), fragrance garden, collection of grasses, flower beds, and a mature arboretum with Aesculus flava, bald cypress, Diospyros virginiana, Fagus sylvatica asplenifolia, ginkgo, Melia azedarach, sequoia (140 years old), and Sophora japonica, as well as a large stand of hardy bamboo (Phyllostachys aurea). Its 1,000 m2 (11,000 sq ft) greenhouses contain about 4,500 plants representing 80 botanical families, including orchids, cacti, and palms.\nThe garden contains three ponds, winding paths, a bronze statue of an eagle (1866) by Metz animalier Christopher Fratin, and a toy train railway that circles through the site.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of botanical gardens in France\n\n\n== References ==\nCapmetz57 blog (photographs)\nChibislife blog (photographs)\nParcs et Jardins entry (French)\nConservatoire des Jardins et Paysages entry (French)\n1001 Fleurs entry (French)\nJe Decouvre La France entry (French)",

        "wiki": "Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (Arabic: \u0641\u064a\u0635\u0644 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 \u0622\u0644 \u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u200e Fay\u1e63al ibn \u2018Abd al-\u2018Az\u012bz \u0100l Su\u2018\u016bd; 14 April 1906 \u2013 25 March 1975) was King of Saudi Arabia from 2 November 1964 to 25 March 1975. \nFaisal was the third son of King Abdulaziz. His mother, Tarfa, was a member of the Al ash-Sheikh family which has produced many prominent Saudi religious leaders. Faisal emerged as an influential royal politician under his father and brother King Saud, serving as foreign minister of the Saudi domains for all but two years from 1930 until his death. He was crown prince after Saud's accession in 1953, and in that position he outlawed slavery in Saudi Arabia. He persuaded King Saud to abdicate in his favour in 1964 with the help of other members of the royal family and his relative, Grand Mufti Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al ash-Sheikh.\nFaisal implemented a policy of modernization and reform. His main foreign policy themes were pan-Islamism, anti-communism, and pro-Palestinian nationalism. He attempted to limit the power of Islamic religious officials. Protesting against support that Israel received from the West, he led the oil embargo which caused the 1973 oil crisis.\nFaisal successfully stabilized the kingdom's bureaucracy, and his reign had significant popularity among Saudi Arabians despite his reforms facing some controversy. In 1975, he was assassinated by his nephew Faisal bin Musaid.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nFaisal bin Abdulaziz was born in Riyadh on 14 April 1906. He was the third son of Saudi Arabia's former king, King Abdulaziz. His mother was Tarfa bint Abdullah bin Abdullatif Al Sheikh, whom Abdulaziz had married in 1902 after capturing Riyadh. She was from the Al ash-Sheikh family, descendants of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab. Faisal's maternal grandfather, Abdullah bin Abdullatif, was one of Abdulaziz's principal religious teachers and advisers. Faisal's mother died in 1912 when he was quite young.Faisal had only one full sister, Nurah. She was married to her cousin, Khalid bin Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman, son of Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman. According to Helen Chapin Metz, Faisal, and most of his generation, was raised in an atmosphere in which courage was extremely valued and reinforced, and he was motivated by his mother to develop the values of tribal leadership.In 1919 the British government invited King Abdulaziz to visit London. He could not go, but sent Prince Faisal, making him the first ever Saudi Arabian royal to visit England. His visit lasted for five months, and he met with British officials. During the same period, he also visited France, again being the first Saudi Arabian royal to pay an official visit there.\n\n\n== Early political experience ==\nAs one of King Abdulaziz's eldest sons, Prince Faisal was given numerous responsibilities to consolidate control over Arabia. After the capture of Hail and initial control over Asir in 1922, he was sent to these provinces with nearly six thousand fighters. He achieved complete control over Asir at the end of the year. Prince Faisal was appointed viceroy of Hejaz in 1926 following his father's takeover of the region. He often consulted with local leaders during his tenure.In 1930 he became his father's minister of foreign affairs. He would continue to oversee Saudi foreign policy until his death\u2014even as king, with only a two-year break between 1960 and 1962. Faisal visited Europe several times in this period, including Poland in 1932 and Russia (as part of the USSR) in 1933. He commanded a campaign during the Saudi\u2013Yemeni War in 1934, resulting in a Saudi victory.\n\n\n== Crown prince and prime minister ==\n\nUpon the accession of Prince Faisal's elder brother, King Saud, to the throne in 1953, Prince Faisal was appointed crown prince. King Saud embarked on a spending program that included the construction of a massive royal residence on the outskirts of the capital, Riyadh. He also faced pressure from neighboring Egypt, where Gamal Abdel Nasser had overthrown the monarchy in 1952. Nasser was able to cultivate a group of dissident princes led by Prince Talal, who defected to Egypt (see Free Princes). Fearing that King Saud's financial policies were bringing the state to the brink of collapse, and that his handling of foreign affairs was inept, senior members of the royal family and the ulema (religious leadership) pressured Saud into appointing Faisal to the position of prime minister in 1958, giving Faisal wide executive powers.A power struggle ensued between King Saud and Crown Prince Faisal, and on 18 December 1960, Prince Faisal resigned as prime minister in protest, arguing that King Saud was frustrating his financial reforms. King Saud took back his executive powers and, having induced Prince Talal to return from Egypt, appointed him as minister of finance in July 1958. In 1962, however, Prince Faisal rallied enough support within the royal family to install himself as prime minister for a second time.In 1963 Prince Faisal established the country's first television station, though actual broadcasts would not begin for another two years. Crown Prince Faisal helped establish the Islamic University of Madinah in 1961. In 1962 Prince Faisal helped found the Muslim World League, a worldwide charity to which the Saudi royal family has reportedly since donated more than a billion dollars.\n\n\n== Struggle with King Saud ==\n\nThe struggle with King Saud continued in the background during this time. Taking advantage of the king's absence from the country for medical reasons in early 1963, Faisal began amassing more power for himself. He removed many of Saud's loyalists from their posts and appointed like-minded princes in key military and security positions, such as his brother Prince Abdullah, to whom he gave command of the National Guard in 1962. Upon King Saud's return, Prince Faisal demanded that he be made regent and that King Saud be reduced to a purely ceremonial role. In this, he had the crucial backing of the ulema (elite Islamic scholars), including a fatw\u0101 (edict) issued by the grand mufti of Saudi Arabia, a relative of Prince Faisal on his mother's side, calling on King Saud to accede to his brother's demands.King Saud refused, however, and made a last-ditch attempt to retake executive powers, leading Prince Faisal to order the National Guard to surround King Saud's palace. His loyalists outnumbered and outgunned, King Saud relented, and on 4 March 1964, Prince Faisal was appointed regent. A meeting of the elders of the royal family and the ulema was convened later that year, and a second fatw\u0101 was decreed by the grand mufti, calling on King Saud to abdicate the throne in favor of his brother. The royal family supported the fatw\u0101 and immediately informed King Saud of their decision. King Saud, by now shorn of all his powers, agreed, and Prince Faisal was proclaimed king on 2 November 1964. Saud then went into exile, finding refuge in Egypt before eventually settling in Greece.\n\n\n== King of Saudi Arabia ==\n\nIn a speech shortly after he came to power on 2 November 1964, Faisal said:I beg of you, brothers, to look upon me as both brother and servant. 'Majesty' is reserved to God alone and 'the throne' is the throne of the Heavens and Earth.\nIn 1967 King Faisal established the post of second prime minister and appointed his half-brother Prince Fahd to this post.\n\n\n=== Modernization ===\nEarly in his rule, he issued an edict that all Saudi princes had to school their children inside the country, rather than sending them abroad; this had the effect of making it popular for upper-class families to bring their sons back to study in the Kingdom. King Faisal also introduced the country's current system of administrative regions, and laid the foundations for a modern welfare system. In 1970 he established the Ministry of Justice and inaugurated the country's first \"five-year plan\" for economic development.Television broadcasts officially began in 1965. In 1966 a nephew of Faisal attacked the newly established headquarters of Saudi television but was killed by security personnel. The attacker was the brother of Faisal's future assassin, and the incident is the most widely accepted motive for the murder.\n\n\n=== Steps against coups d'\u00e9tat ===\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s saw numerous coups d'\u00e9tat in the region. Muammar al-Gaddafi's coup that overthrew the monarchy in oil-rich Libya in 1969 was especially threatening for Saudi Arabia due to the similarity between the two sparsely-populated desert countries. As a result, King Faisal undertook to build a sophisticated security apparatus and cracked down firmly on dissent. As in all affairs, King Faisal justified these policies in Islamic terms. Early in his reign, when faced with demands for a written constitution for the country, King Faisal responded that \"our constitution is the Quran\". In the summer of 1969 King Faisal ordered the arrest of hundreds of military officers, including some generals, alleging that a military coup d'\u00e9tat was being planned. The coup was planned primarily by air force officers and aimed at overthrowing the monarchy and founding a Nasserist regime in the country. The arrests were possibly based on a tip from American intelligence.\n\n\n=== Religious inclusiveness ===\n\nKing Faisal seemed to hold the pluralist view, favouring limited, cautious accommodation of popular demands for inclusive reform, and made repeated attempts to broaden political representation, harking back to his temporarily successful national integration policy from 1965 to 1975. King Faisal acknowledged his country's religious and cultural diversity, which includes the predominantly Shia al-Ahsa in the east; the Asir in the southwest, with tribal affinities to Yemen, especially among the Ismaili tribes of Najran and Jizan; and the Kingdom of the Hejaz, with its capital Mecca. He included non-Wahhabi, cosmopolitan Sunni Hejazis from Mecca and Jeddah in the Saudi government. However, after his reign, discrimination based on sect, tribe, region, and gender became the order of the day and has remained as such until today.The role and authority of the ulema declined after the rise of King Faisal even though they had helped bring him to the throne in 1964. Despite his piety and biological relationship through his mother to the Al as Shaykh family, and his support for the pan-Islamic movement in his struggle against pan-Arabism, he decreased the ulema's power and influence. Unlike his successor King Khalid, King Faisal attempted to prevent radical clerics from controlling religious institutions such as the Council of Senior Ulema, the highest religious institution in Saudi Arabia, or taking religious offices such as Grand Mufti, responsible for preserving Islamic law. But his advisers warned that, once religious zealots had been motivated, disastrous effects would result. King Faisal rejected the ulema's opposition to aspects of his accelerated modernization attempts, sometimes even in matters considered by them to be major issues such as education for women.Corruption in the royal family was taken very seriously by religious figures in the Islamic theological colleges. They challenged some of the accepted theological interpretations adopted by the Saudi regime. One such influential figure was Shaykh bin Baz, then rector of the Al Medina college of theology. King Faisal would not tolerate his criticism and had him removed from his position. However, his teachings had already radicalized some of his students. One of them was Juhayman al-Otaybi.\n\n\n=== Abolition of slavery ===\n\nSlavery did not vanish in Saudi Arabia until King Faisal issued a decree for its total abolition in 1962. BBC presenter Peter Hobday stated that about 1,682 slaves were freed at that time, at a cost to the government of $2,000 each. The political analyst Bruce Riedel argued that the US began to raise the issue of slavery after the meeting between King Abdulaziz and US president Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945 and that John F. Kennedy finally persuaded the House of Saud to abolish slavery in 1962.\n\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n\nAs king, Faisal continued the close alliance with the United States begun by his father, and relied on the US heavily for arming and training his armed forces. King Faisal was anti-communist. He refused any political ties with the Soviet Union and other Communist bloc countries, professing to see a complete incompatibility between communism and Islam.Between 23 and 25 September 1969, King Faisal convened a conference in Rabat, Morocco, to discuss the arson attack on the Al Aqsa Mosque that had occurred a month earlier. The leaders of 25 Muslim states attended and the conference called for Israel to give up territory conquered in 1967. The conference also set up the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and pledged its support for the Palestinians.Following the death of Nasser in 1970, King Faisal drew closer to Egypt's new president, Anwar Sadat, who himself was planning a break with the Soviet Union and a move towards the pro-American camp. During the 1973 Arab\u2013Israeli War, launched by Sadat, King Faisal withdrew Saudi oil from world markets, in protest over Western support for Israel during the conflict. This action increased the price of oil and was the primary force behind the 1973 oil crisis. It was to be the defining act of King Faisal's career, and gained him lasting prestige among many Arabs and Muslims worldwide. In 1974 he was named Time magazine's Man of the Year, and the financial windfall generated by the crisis fueled the economic boom that occurred in Saudi Arabia after his death. The new oil revenue also allowed Faisal to greatly increase the aid and subsidies begun following the 1967 Six-Day War to Egypt, Syria, and the Palestine Liberation Organization. It is a commonly-held belief in Saudi Arabia, and the wider Arab world, that King Faisal's oil embargo was the real cause of his assassination, via a Western conspiracy.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nKing Faisal was married four times concurrently. His spouses were from powerful families: Al Kabir, Al Sudairi, Al Jiluwi and Al Thunayan. His wives were:\n\nSultana bint Ahmed Al Sudairi, the mother of his eldest son Prince Abdullah, whom Faisal fathered when he was only fifteen. Sultana was from the Sudairi family and the younger sister of Hassa bint Ahmed, the mother of the Sudairi brothers.Iffat Al-Thunayan (1916\u20132000), who was born and raised in Turkey. Her ancestors of the Al Thunayan branch of the Al Saud family were taken to Istanbul or Cairo by Egyptian forces in 1818. They first met in Istanbul around 1932 while he was in Turkey for an official visit. Prince Faisal took Iffat to Jeddah where they were married in 1932. They had nine children, including Prince Mohammed, Prince Saud, and Prince Turki. Iffat was credited with being the influence behind many of her husband's reforms, particularly with regard to women.Al Jawhara bint Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud Al Kabir, the daughter of his aunt Nuora bint Abdul Rahman. They married in October 1935. With Al Jawhara, Faisal had a daughter, Munira.Haya bint Turki bin Abdulaziz Al Turki, the mother of Prince Khalid. She was a member of the Al Jiluwi clan.Faisal's sons received a higher level of education compared to other princes born to Saudi monarchs. Prince Turki received formal education at prestigious schools in New Jersey, and he later attended Georgetown University, while Prince Saud was an alumnus of Princeton University. King Faisal's sons have held, and continue to hold, important positions in the Saudi government. His eldest son Prince Abdullah was born in 1922 and held governmental positions for a while. Prince Khalid was the governor of Asir Province in southwestern Saudi Arabia for more than three decades before becoming governor of Makkah Province in 2007. Prince Saud was the Saudi foreign minister between 1975 and 2015. Prince Turki served as head of Saudi Intelligence, ambassador to the United Kingdom, and later ambassador to the United States.King Faisal's daughter Haifa is married to Bandar bin Sultan. By giving Haifa's hand in marriage to Prince Bandar, King Faisal forced Bandar's father Prince Sultan to recognize Bandar as a legitimate prince. Another daughter, Lolowah, is a prominent activist for women's education in Saudi Arabia. In 1962 his daughter Princess Sara founded one of the first charitable organizations, Al Nahda, which won the first Chaillot prize for human rights organisations in the Gulf in 2009. One of his daughters, Prince Khalid's full sister Princess Mishail, died at the age of 72 in October 2011. His granddaughter, Princess Reem Al Faisal, is a photographer and gallery owner based in Jeddah.King Faisal spoke fluent English and French, as does his daughter Princess Lolowah.\n\n\n== Assassination ==\nOn 25 March 1975 King Faisal was shot point-blank and killed by his half-brother's son, Faisal bin Musaid, who had just come back from the United States. The murder occurred at a majlis (literally 'a place for sitting'), an event where the king or leader opens up his residence to the citizens to enter and petition the king.In the waiting room, Prince Faisal talked to Kuwaiti representatives who were also waiting to meet King Faisal. When the Prince went to embrace him, King Faisal leaned to kiss his nephew in accordance with Saudi custom. At that instant, Prince Faisal took out a pistol and shot him. The first shot hit King Faisal's chin and the second one went through his ear. A bodyguard hit Prince Faisal with a sheathed sword. Oil minister Zaki Yamani yelled repeatedly not to kill the prince.King Faisal was quickly taken to a hospital. He was still alive as doctors massaged his heart and gave him a blood transfusion. Their efforts were unsuccessful, and King Faisal died shortly afterward. Both before and after the attack the prince was reported to be calm. Following the killing, Riyadh had three days of mourning during which all government activities were suspended.One theory for the murder was avenging the death of Prince Khalid bin Musaid, the brother of Prince Faisal bin Musaid. King Faisal instituted modern and secular reforms that led to the installation of television, which provoked violent protests, one of which was led by Prince Khalid, who, during the course of an attack on a television station in 1966, was shot dead by a policeman.Prince Faisal, who was captured directly after the attack, was at first officially declared insane, but following the trial a panel of Saudi medical experts decided that he was sane when he shot the king. The nation's high religious court convicted him of regicide and sentenced him to execution. He was beheaded in the public square in Riyadh.King Faisal's body was buried in Al Oud cemetery in Riyadh on 26 March 1975. His successor, King Khalid, wept over his body at his funeral.\n\n\n== Memorials and legacy ==\n\nAfter his death, the King Faisal Foundation, a philanthropic organisation, was established in King Faisal's honour. King Faisal was eulogized by lyricist Robert Hunter in the title track of the Grateful Dead's 1975 album Blues for Allah.

        "wiki": "Metz ( METS, French: [m\u025bs] (listen), Lorraine Franconian: [m\u025bts]) Latin: Divodurum Mediomatricorum is a city in northeast France located at the confluence of the Moselle and the Seille rivers. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle department and the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region. Located near the tripoint along the junction of France, Germany, and Luxembourg, the city forms a central place of the European Greater Region and the SaarLorLux euroregion.Metz has a rich 3,000-year-history, having variously been a Celtic oppidum, an important Gallo-Roman city, the Merovingian capital of Austrasia, the birthplace of the Carolingian dynasty, a cradle of the Gregorian chant, and one of the oldest republics in Europe. The city has been steeped in Romance culture, but has been strongly influenced by Germanic culture due to its location and history.Because of its historical, cultural, and architectural background, Metz has been submitted on France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. The city features noteworthy buildings such as the Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral with its largest expanse of stained-glass windows in the world, the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains being the oldest church in France, its Imperial Station Palace displaying the apartment of the German Kaiser, or its Opera House, the oldest one working in France. Metz is home to some world-class venues including the Arsenal Concert Hall and the Centre Pompidou-Metz museum.\nA basin of urban ecology, Metz gained its nickname of The Green City (French: La Ville Verte), as it has extensive open grounds and public gardens. The historic city centre is one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France.A historic garrison town, Metz is the economic heart of the Lorraine region, specialising in information technology and automotive industries. Metz is home to the University of Lorraine, Georgia Tech Lorraine, and a centre for applied research and development in the materials sector, notably in metallurgy and metallography, the heritage of the Lorraine region's past in the iron and steel industry.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn ancient times, the town was known as \"city of Mediomatrici\", being inhabited by the tribe of the same name. After its integration into the Roman Empire, the city was called Divodurum Mediomatricum, meaning Holy Village or Holy Fortress of the Mediomatrici, then it was known as Mediomatrix. During the 5th century AD, the name evolved to \"Mettis\", which gave rise to Metz.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMetz has a recorded history dating back over 2,000 years. Before the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar in 52 BC, it was the oppidum of the Celtic Mediomatrici tribe. Integrated into the Roman Empire, Metz became quickly one of the principal towns of Gaul with a population of 40,000, until the barbarian depredations and its transfer to the Franks about the end of the 5th century. Between the 6th and 8th centuries, the city was the residence of the Merovingian kings of Austrasia. After the Treaty of Verdun in 843, Metz became the capital of the Kingdom of Lotharingia and was ultimately integrated into the Holy Roman Empire, being granted semi-independent status. During the 12th century, Metz became a republic and the Republic of Metz stood until the 15th century.With the signature of the Treaty of Chambord in 1552, Metz passed to the hands of the Kings of France. As the German Protestant Princes who traded Metz (alongside Toul and Verdun) for the promise of French military assistance, had no authority to cede territory of the Holy Roman Empire, the change of jurisdiction wasn't recognised by the Holy Roman Empire until the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. Under French rule, Metz was selected as capital of the Three Bishoprics and became a strategic fortified town. With creation of the departments by the Estates-General of 1789, Metz was chosen as capital of the Department of Moselle. Although French-speaking, after the Franco-Prussian War and according to the Treaty of Frankfurt of 1871, the city was annexed into the German Empire, being part of the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine and serving as capital of the Bezirk Lothringen.Metz remained German until the end of World War I, when it reverted to France. However, after the Battle of France during the Second World War, the city was annexed once more by the German Third Reich. In 1944, the attack on the city by the U.S. Third Army freed the city from German rule and Metz reverted one more time to France after World War II.During the 1950s, Metz was chosen to be the capital of the newly created Lorraine region. With the creation of the European Community and the later European Union, the city has become central to the Greater Region and the SaarLorLux Euroregion.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMetz is located on the banks of the Moselle and the Seille rivers, 43 km (26.7 mi) from the Schengen tripoint where the borders of France, Germany, and Luxembourg meet. The city was built in a place where many branches of the Moselle river creates several islands, which are encompassed within the urban planning.The terrain of Metz forms part of the Paris Basin and presents a plateau relief cut by river valleys presenting cuestas in the north\u2013south direction. Metz and its surrounding countryside are included in the forest and crop Lorraine Regional Natural Park, covering a total area of 205,000 ha (506,566.0 acres).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of Lorraine is a semi-continental climate. The summers are warm and humid, sometimes stormy, and the warmest month of the year is July, when daytime temperatures average approximately 25 \u00b0C (77.0 \u00b0F). The winters are cold and snowy with temperature dropping to an average low of \u22120.5 \u00b0C (31.1 \u00b0F) in January. Lows can be much colder through the night and early morning and the snowy period extends from November to February.The length of the day varies significantly over the course of the year. The shortest day is 21 December with 7:30 hours of sunlight; the longest day is 20 June with 16:30 hours of sunlight. The median cloud cover is 93% and does not vary substantially over the course of the year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nThe inhabitants of Metz are called Messin(e)s. Statistics on the ethnic and religious make up of the population of Metz are haphazard, as the French Republic prohibits making distinctions between citizens regarding race, beliefs, and political and philosophic opinions in the process of census taking. This would otherwise document the city to be a Germanic locale, as is the rest of the province and the neighboring Alsace.The French national census of 2012 estimated the population of Metz to be 119,551, while the population of Metz urban agglomeration was about 389,851. Through history, Metz's population has been impacted by the vicissitudes of the wars and annexations involving the city, which have prevented continuous population growth. More recently, the city has suffered from the restructuring of the military and the metallurgy industry. The historical population for the current area of Metz municipality is as follows:\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\nSeveral well-known figures have been linked to the city of Metz throughout its history. Renowned Messins include poet Paul Verlaine, composer Ambroise Thomas, and mathematician Jean-Victor Poncelet; numerous well-known German figures were also born in Metz notably during the annexation periods. Moreover, the city has been the residence of people such as writer Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Cardinal Mazarin, political thinker Alexis de Tocqueville, French patriot and American Revolutionary War hero Marquis Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette, and Luxembourg-born German-French statesman Robert Schuman.\n\n\n== Law and government ==\n\n\n=== Local law ===\n\nThe Local Law (French: droit local) applied in Metz is a legal system that operates in parallel with French law. Created in 1919, it preserves the French laws applied in France before 1870 and maintained by the Germans during the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, but repealed in the rest of France after 1871. It also maintains German laws enacted by the German Empire between 1871 and 1918, specific provisions adopted by the local authorities, and French laws that have been enacted after 1919 to be applicable only in Alsace-Lorraine. This specific local legislation encompasses different areas including religion, social work and finance.\nThe most striking of the legal differences between France and Alsace-Lorraine is the absence in Alsace-Lorraine of strict secularism, even though a constitutional right of freedom of religion is guaranteed by the French government. Alsace-Lorraine is still governed by a pre-1905 law established by the Concordat of 1801, which provides for the public subsidy of the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches and the Jewish religion.\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\nLike every commune of the present French Republic, Metz is managed by a mayor (French: maire) and a municipal council (French: conseil municipal), democratically elected by two-round proportional voting for six years. The mayor is assisted by 54 municipal councillors, and the municipal council is held on the last Thursday of every month. Since 2008, the mayor of Metz has been socialist Dominique Gros.The city belongs to the Metz Metropole union of cities, which includes the 40 cities of the Metz urban agglomeration. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle based in the former Intendant Palace. In addition, Metz is the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region, hosted in the former Saint-Clement Abbey.\n\n\n=== City administrative divisions ===\n\nThe city of Metz is divided into 14 administrative divisions:\n\n\n== Cityscape and environmental policy ==\n\nMetz contains a mishmash of architectural layers, bearing witness to centuries of history at the crossroads of different cultures, and features a number of architectural landmarks. The city possesses one of the largest Urban Conservation Areas in France, and more than 100 of the city's buildings are classified on the Monument Historique list. Because of its historical and cultural background, Metz is designated as French Town of Art and History, and has been submitted on to France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List.The city is famous for its yellow limestone architecture, a result of the extensive use of Jaumont stone. The historic district has kept part of the Gallo-Roman city with Divodurum's Cardo Maximus, then called Via Scarponensis (today the Trinitaires, Taison, and Serpenoise streets), and the Decumanus Maximus (today En Fournirue and d'Estr\u00e9es streets). At the Cardo and Decumanus intersection was situated the Roman forum, today the Saint-Jacques Square.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nFrom its Gallo-Roman past, the city preserves vestiges of the thermae (in the basement of the Golden Courtyard museum), parts of the aqueduct, and the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains.Saint Louis' square with its vaulted arcades and a Knights Templar chapel remains a major symbol of the city's High Medieval heritage. The Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral, several churches and H\u00f4tels, and two remarkable municipal granaries reflect the Late Middle Ages. Examples of Renaissance architecture can be seen in H\u00f4tels from the 16th century, such as the House of Heads (French: Maison des T\u00eates).The city hall and the buildings surrounding the town square are by French architect Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Blondel, who was awarded the task of redesigning and modernizing the centre of Metz by the Royal Academy of Architecture in 1755 the context of the Enlightenment. Neoclassical buildings from the 18th century, such as the Opera House, the Intendant Palace (the present-day prefecture), and the Royal Governor's Palace (the present-day courthouse) built by Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau, are also found in the city.The Imperial District was built during the first annexation of Metz by the German Empire. In order to \"germanise\" the city, Emperor Wilhelm II decided to create a new district shaped by a distinctive blend of Germanic architecture, including Renaissance, neo-Romanesque and neo-Classical, mixed with elements of Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Alsatian and mock-Bavarian styles. Instead of Jaumont stone, commonly used everywhere else in the city, stone used in the Rhineland, such as pink and grey sandstone, granite and basalt were used. The district features noteworthy buildings including the rail station and the Central Post Office by German architect J\u00fcrgen Kr\u00f6ger.Modern architecture can also be seen in the town with works of French architects Roger-Henri Expert (Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-de-l'Enfant-J\u00e9sus church, 1934), Georges-Henri Pingusson (Fire Station, 1960), and Jean Dubuisson (subdivisions, 1960s). The refurbishment of the former Ney Arsenal as a Concert Hall in 1989 and the erection of the Metz Arena in 2002, by Spanish and French architects Ricardo Bofill and French Paul Chemetov represent the Postmodern movement.The Centre Pompidou-Metz museum in the Amphitheatre District represents a strong architectural initiative to mark the entrance of Metz into the 21st century. Designed by Japanese architect Shigeru Ban, the building is remarkable for the complex, innovative carpentry of its roof, and integrates concepts of sustainable architecture. The project encompasses the architecture of two recipients of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, Shigeru Ban (2014) and French Christian de Portzamparc (1994). The Amphitheatre District is also conceived by French architects Nicolas Michelin, Jean-Paul Viguier, and Jean-Michel Wilmotte and designer Philippe Starck. The urban project is expected to be completed by 2023. Further, a contemporary music venue designed by contextualist French architect Rudy Ricciotti stands in the Borny District.\n\n\n=== Urban ecology ===\n\nUnder the leadership of such people as botanist Jean-Marie Pelt, Metz pioneered a policy of urban ecology during the early 1970s. Because of the failure of post-war urban planning and housing estate development in Europe during the 1960s, mostly based on the concepts of CIAM, Jean-Marie Pelt, then municipal councillor of Metz, initiated a new approach to the urban environment.Based initially on the ideas of the Chicago School, Pelt's theories pleaded for better integration of humans into their environment and developed a concept centered on the relationship between \"stone and water\". His policy was realized in Metz by the establishment of extensive open areas surrounding the Moselle and the Seille rivers and the development of large pedestrian areas. As a result, Metz has over 37 m2 (400 sq ft) of open areas per inhabitant in the form of numerous public gardens in the city.The principles of urban ecology are still applied in Metz with the implementation of a local Agenda 21 action plan. The municipal ecological policy encompasses the sustainable refurbishment of ancient buildings, the erection of sustainable districts and buildings, green public transport, and the creation of public gardens by means of landscape architecture.Additionally, the city has developed its own combined heat and power station, using waste wood biomass from the surrounding forests as a renewable energy source. With a thermal efficiency above 80%, the 45MW boiler of the plant provides electricity and heat for 44,000 dwellings. The Metz power station is the first local producer and distributor of energy in France.\n\n\n=== Military architecture ===\n\nAs a historic Garrison town, Metz has been heavily influenced by military architecture throughout its history. From ancient history to the present, the city has been successively fortified and modified to accommodate the troops stationed there. Defensive walls from classical antiquity to the 20th century are still visible today, incorporated into the design of public gardens along the Moselle and Seille rivers. A medieval bridge castle from the 13th century, named Germans' Gate (French: Porte des Allemands), today converted into a convention and exhibition centre, has become one of the landmarks of the city. It is still possible to see parts of the 16th century citadel, as well as fortifications built in the 1740s by Louis de Cormontaigne but based on designs by Vauban. Important barracks, mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries, are spread around the city: some, which are of architectural interest, have been converted to civilian use, such as the Arsenal Concert Hall by Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill.\nThe extensive fortifications of Metz, which ring the city, include early examples of S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res system forts. Other forts were incorporated into the Maginot Line. A hiking trail on the Saint-Quentin plateau passes through a former military training zone and ends at the now abandoned military forts, providing a vantage point from which to survey the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAlthough the steel industry has historically dominated Moselle's economy, Metz's efforts at economic diversification have created a base in the sectors of commerce, tourism, information technology and the automotive industry. The city is the economic heart of the Lorraine region and around 73,000 people work daily within the urban agglomeration. The transport facilities found in the conurbation, including the international high-speed railway, motorway, inland connections and the local bus rapid transit system, have made the city a transport hub in the heart of the European Union. Metz is home to the biggest harbour handling cereals in France with over 4,000,000 tons/year.Metz is home to the Moselle Chamber of Commerce. International companies such as PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, ArcelorMittal, SFR, and TDF have established plants and centres in the Metz conurbation. Metz is also the regional headquarters of the Caisse d'Epargne and Banque Populaire banking groups.\nMetz is an important commercial centre of northern France with France's biggest retailer federation, consisting of around 2,000 retailers. Important retail companies are found in the city, such as the Galeries Lafayette, the Printemps department store and the Fnac entertainment retail chain. The historic city centre displays one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France and a mall, the Saint-Jacques centre. In addition there are several multiplex movie theatres and malls found in the urban agglomeration.\nIn recent years, Metz municipality have promoted an ambitious policy of tourism development, including urban revitalization and refurbishment of buildings and public squares. This policy has been spurred by the creation of the Centre Pompidou-Metz in 2010. Since its inauguration, the institution has become the most popular cultural venue in France outside Paris, with 550,000 visitors per year. Meanwhile, Saint-Stephen Cathedral is the most visited building in the city, accommodating 652,000 visitors per year.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums and exhibition halls ===\n\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz is a museum of modern and contemporary arts, the largest temporary exhibition area in France outside Paris.

The cathedral exhibits the collection of the Bishopric of Metz, including paraments and items used in the service of the Eucharist. Metz Cathedral is sometimes nicknamed the Good Lord's Lantern (French: la Lanterne du Bon Dieu), as it has the largest expanse of stained glass windows in the world: 6,500 m2 (70,000 sq ft). These include works by Gothic and Renaissance master glass makers Hermann von M\u00fcnster, Th\u00e9obald of Lixheim, and Valentin Bousch, romantic Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, tachist Roger Bissi\u00e8re, cubist Jacques Villon and modernist Marc Chagall.\nAnother of the city's churches displays a complete set of stained glass windows by French modernist Jean Cocteau.In addition, Metz features other museums and exhibition venues, such as:\n\nThe FRAC Lorraine, a public collection of contemporary art of the Lorraine region. It is located in the 12th-century Saint-Liver H\u00f4tel and organizes exhibitions of local and international contemporary artists.\nThe Golden Courtyard (French: la Cour d'Or), a museum dedicated to the history of Metz, divided into four sections (e.g. archeology, medieval, architecture, and fine arts). The Golden Courtyard displays a rich collection of Gallo-Roman and medieval finds and the remains of the Gallo-Roman baths of Divodurum Mediomatricum, revealed by the extension works to the museums in the 1930s.\nThe Museum of the 1870 War and of the Annexion in Gravelotte, a village located within the Metz-Metropole conurbation and the site of the Battle of Gravelotte, the only museum in Europe dedicated to the Franco-Prussian War. The museum exhibits military and everyday items from the period as well as artworks related to the 1870 war. A mausoleum erected in 1904 honoring the soldiers who died during the battle, the Memorial Hall (French: La Halle du Souvenir), has been included in the museum.\nThe House for Europe, located on the estate of Robert Schuman in Scy-Chazelles in the Metz-Metropole conurbation, transformed into a museum and convention centre. Across the street is the fortified 12th Century church where Robert Schuman now rests. The Robert Schuman House for Europe organises cultural and educational events that introduce the visitor to Schuman's life and works and to the way Europe has been constructed and continues to develop today.\nVerlaine's House (French: la Maison de Verlaine) is a museum located in the house where the poet Paul Verlaine was born, dedicated to his work, featuring permanent and temporary exhibitions. The Solange Bertrand foundation, located in the artist's former house, conserves and displays her artworks. The municipal archives preserve and exhibit Metz's historical municipal records dating from medieval times to the present.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\nMetz has several venues for the performing arts. The Opera House of Metz, the oldest working opera house in France, features plays, dance, and lyric poetry. The Arsenal Concert Hall, dedicated to art music, is widely renowned for its excellent acoustics. The Trinitarians Club is a multi-media arts complex housed in the vaulted cellar and chapel of an ancient convent, the city's prime venue for jazz music. The Music Box (French: Boite \u00e0 Musique), familiarly known as BAM, is the concert venue dedicated to rock and electronic music. The Braun Hall and the Kolt\u00e8s Theater feature plays, and the city has two movie theaters specializing in Auteur cinema. The Saint-Jacques Square, surrounded by busy bars and pubs whose open-air tables fill the centre of the square.\nSince 2014, the former bus garage has been converted to accommodate over thirty artists in residence, in a space where they can create and rehearse artworks and even build set decorations. The artistic complex, called Metz Network of All Cultures (French: Toutes les Cultures en R\u00e9seau \u00e0 Metz) and familiarly known as TCRM-Blida, encompasses a large hall of 3,000 m2 (32,000 sq ft) while theater and dance companies benefit from a studio of 800 m2 (8,600 sq ft) with backstages.\n\n\n=== Metz in the arts ===\nMetz was an important cultural centre during the Carolingian Renaissance. For instance, Gregorian chant was created in Metz during the 8th century as a fusion of Gallican and ancient Roman repertory. Then called Messin Chant, it remains the oldest form of music still in use in Western Europe. The bishops of Metz, notably Saint-Chrodegang promoted its use for the Roman liturgy in Gallic lands under the favorable influence of the Carolingian monarchs. Messin chant made two major contributions to the body of chant: it fitted the chant into the ancient Greek octoechos system, and invented an innovative musical notation, using neumes to show the shape of a remembered melody. Metz was also an important centre of illumination of Carolingian manuscripts, producing such monuments of Carolingian book illumination as the Drogo Sacramentary.The Metz School (French: \u00c9cole de Metz) was an art movement in Metz and the region between 1834 and 1870, centred on Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal. The term was originally proposed in 1845 by the poet Charles Baudelaire, who appreciated the works of the artists. They were influenced by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix and inspired by the medieval heritage of Metz and its romantic surroundings. The Franco-Prussian War and the annexation of the territory by the Germans resulted in the dismantling of the movement. The main figures of the Metz School were Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, Auguste Migette, Auguste Hussenot, Louis-Th\u00e9odore Devilly, Christopher Fratin, and Charles P\u00eatre. Their works include paintings, engravings, drawings, stained-glass windows, and sculptures.\nA festival named \"passages\" takes place in May. Numerous shows are presented to it.\n\n\n=== The Graoully dragon as symbol of the city ===\n\nThe Graoully is depicted as a fearsome dragon, vanquished by the sacred powers of Saint Clement of Metz, the first Bishop of the city. The Graoully quickly became a symbol of Metz and can be seen in numerous insignia of the city, from the 10th century on. Writers from Metz tend to present the legend as an allegory of Christianity's victory over paganism, represented by the harmful dragon.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nLocal specialties include the quiche, the pot\u00e9e, the Lorrain p\u00e2t\u00e9, and also suckling pig. Different recipes, such as jam, tart, charcuterie and fruit brandy, are made from the Mirabelle and Damson plums. Also, Metz is the cradle of some pastries like the Metz cheese pie and the Metz Balls (French: boulet de Metz), a ganache-stuffed biscuit coated with marzipan, caramel, and dark chocolate. Local beverages include Moselle wine and Amos beer.The Covered Market of Metz is one of the oldest, most grandiose in France and is home to traditional local food producers and retailers. Originally built as the bishop's palace, the French Revolution broke out before the Bishop of Metz could move in and the citizens decided to turn it into a food market. The adjacent Chamber's Square (French: Place de la Chambre) is surrounded by numerous local food restaurants.\n\n\n=== Celebrations and events ===\nMany events are celebrated in Metz throughout the year. The city of Metz dedicates two weeks to the Mirabelle plum during the popular Mirabelle Festival held in August. During the festival, in addition to open markets selling fresh plums, mirabelle tarts, and mirabelle liquor, there are live music, fireworks, parties, art exhibits, a parade with floral floats, a competition, the crowning of the Mirabelle Queen and a gala of celebration.A literature festival is held in June. The Montgolfiades hot air balloon festival is organized in September. The second most popular Christmas Market in France is held in November and December.

Along with this expansion, several graduate schools took the opportunity to establish campuses in the park. At first, facilities were grouped around the lake Symphony, like Sup\u00e9lec in 1985 and Georgia Tech Lorraine in 1990. In 1996, the engineering school Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech (ENSAM) built a research and learning center next to the golf course. This opened the way to the development of a new area, where the Franco-German university (ISFATES) and the ENIM moved in 2010. These graduate schools often cooperate with the University of Lorraine. For instance, the university and ENSAM share research teams, laboratories, equipments, and doctoral programs.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\nPublic transport includes a bus rapid transit system, called Mettis.

        "wiki": "Metz ( METS, French: [m\u025bs] (listen), Lorraine Franconian: [m\u025bts]) Latin: Divodurum Mediomatricorum is a city in northeast France located at the confluence of the Moselle and the Seille rivers. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle department and the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region. Located near the tripoint along the junction of France, Germany, and Luxembourg, the city forms a central place of the European Greater Region and the SaarLorLux euroregion.Metz has a rich 3,000-year-history, having variously been a Celtic oppidum, an important Gallo-Roman city, the Merovingian capital of Austrasia, the birthplace of the Carolingian dynasty, a cradle of the Gregorian chant, and one of the oldest republics in Europe. The city has been steeped in Romance culture, but has been strongly influenced by Germanic culture due to its location and history.Because of its historical, cultural, and architectural background, Metz has been submitted on France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. The city features noteworthy buildings such as the Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral with its largest expanse of stained-glass windows in the world, the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains being the oldest church in France, its Imperial Station Palace displaying the apartment of the German Kaiser, or its Opera House, the oldest one working in France. Metz is home to some world-class venues including the Arsenal Concert Hall and the Centre Pompidou-Metz museum.\nA basin of urban ecology, Metz gained its nickname of The Green City (French: La Ville Verte), as it has extensive open grounds and public gardens. The historic city centre is one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France.A historic garrison town, Metz is the economic heart of the Lorraine region, specialising in information technology and automotive industries. Metz is home to the University of Lorraine, Georgia Tech Lorraine, and a centre for applied research and development in the materials sector, notably in metallurgy and metallography, the heritage of the Lorraine region's past in the iron and steel industry.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn ancient times, the town was known as \"city of Mediomatrici\", being inhabited by the tribe of the same name. After its integration into the Roman Empire, the city was called Divodurum Mediomatricum, meaning Holy Village or Holy Fortress of the Mediomatrici, then it was known as Mediomatrix. During the 5th century AD, the name evolved to \"Mettis\", which gave rise to Metz.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMetz has a recorded history dating back over 2,000 years. Before the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar in 52 BC, it was the oppidum of the Celtic Mediomatrici tribe. Integrated into the Roman Empire, Metz became quickly one of the principal towns of Gaul with a population of 40,000, until the barbarian depredations and its transfer to the Franks about the end of the 5th century. Between the 6th and 8th centuries, the city was the residence of the Merovingian kings of Austrasia. After the Treaty of Verdun in 843, Metz became the capital of the Kingdom of Lotharingia and was ultimately integrated into the Holy Roman Empire, being granted semi-independent status. During the 12th century, Metz became a republic and the Republic of Metz stood until the 15th century.With the signature of the Treaty of Chambord in 1552, Metz passed to the hands of the Kings of France. As the German Protestant Princes who traded Metz (alongside Toul and Verdun) for the promise of French military assistance, had no authority to cede territory of the Holy Roman Empire, the change of jurisdiction wasn't recognised by the Holy Roman Empire until the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. Under French rule, Metz was selected as capital of the Three Bishoprics and became a strategic fortified town. With creation of the departments by the Estates-General of 1789, Metz was chosen as capital of the Department of Moselle. Although French-speaking, after the Franco-Prussian War and according to the Treaty of Frankfurt of 1871, the city was annexed into the German Empire, being part of the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine and serving as capital of the Bezirk Lothringen.Metz remained German until the end of World War I, when it reverted to France. However, after the Battle of France during the Second World War, the city was annexed once more by the German Third Reich. In 1944, the attack on the city by the U.S. Third Army freed the city from German rule and Metz reverted one more time to France after World War II.During the 1950s, Metz was chosen to be the capital of the newly created Lorraine region. With the creation of the European Community and the later European Union, the city has become central to the Greater Region and the SaarLorLux Euroregion.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMetz is located on the banks of the Moselle and the Seille rivers, 43 km (26.7 mi) from the Schengen tripoint where the borders of France, Germany, and Luxembourg meet. The city was built in a place where many branches of the Moselle river creates several islands, which are encompassed within the urban planning.The terrain of Metz forms part of the Paris Basin and presents a plateau relief cut by river valleys presenting cuestas in the north\u2013south direction. Metz and its surrounding countryside are included in the forest and crop Lorraine Regional Natural Park, covering a total area of 205,000 ha (506,566.0 acres).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of Lorraine is a semi-continental climate. The summers are warm and humid, sometimes stormy, and the warmest month of the year is July, when daytime temperatures average approximately 25 \u00b0C (77.0 \u00b0F). The winters are cold and snowy with temperature dropping to an average low of \u22120.5 \u00b0C (31.1 \u00b0F) in January. Lows can be much colder through the night and early morning and the snowy period extends from November to February.The length of the day varies significantly over the course of the year. The shortest day is 21 December with 7:30 hours of sunlight; the longest day is 20 June with 16:30 hours of sunlight. The median cloud cover is 93% and does not vary substantially over the course of the year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nThe inhabitants of Metz are called Messin(e)s. Statistics on the ethnic and religious make up of the population of Metz are haphazard, as the French Republic prohibits making distinctions between citizens regarding race, beliefs, and political and philosophic opinions in the process of census taking. This would otherwise document the city to be a Germanic locale, as is the rest of the province and the neighboring Alsace.The French national census of 2012 estimated the population of Metz to be 119,551, while the population of Metz urban agglomeration was about 389,851. Through history, Metz's population has been impacted by the vicissitudes of the wars and annexations involving the city, which have prevented continuous population growth. More recently, the city has suffered from the restructuring of the military and the metallurgy industry. The historical population for the current area of Metz municipality is as follows:\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\nSeveral well-known figures have been linked to the city of Metz throughout its history. Renowned Messins include poet Paul Verlaine, composer Ambroise Thomas, and mathematician Jean-Victor Poncelet; numerous well-known German figures were also born in Metz notably during the annexation periods. Moreover, the city has been the residence of people such as writer Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Cardinal Mazarin, political thinker Alexis de Tocqueville, French patriot and American Revolutionary War hero Marquis Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette, and Luxembourg-born German-French statesman Robert Schuman.\n\n\n== Law and government ==\n\n\n=== Local law ===\n\nThe Local Law (French: droit local) applied in Metz is a legal system that operates in parallel with French law. Created in 1919, it preserves the French laws applied in France before 1870 and maintained by the Germans during the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, but repealed in the rest of France after 1871. It also maintains German laws enacted by the German Empire between 1871 and 1918, specific provisions adopted by the local authorities, and French laws that have been enacted after 1919 to be applicable only in Alsace-Lorraine. This specific local legislation encompasses different areas including religion, social work and finance.\nThe most striking of the legal differences between France and Alsace-Lorraine is the absence in Alsace-Lorraine of strict secularism, even though a constitutional right of freedom of religion is guaranteed by the French government. Alsace-Lorraine is still governed by a pre-1905 law established by the Concordat of 1801, which provides for the public subsidy of the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches and the Jewish religion.\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\nLike every commune of the present French Republic, Metz is managed by a mayor (French: maire) and a municipal council (French: conseil municipal), democratically elected by two-round proportional voting for six years. The mayor is assisted by 54 municipal councillors, and the municipal council is held on the last Thursday of every month. Since 2008, the mayor of Metz has been socialist Dominique Gros.The city belongs to the Metz Metropole union of cities, which includes the 40 cities of the Metz urban agglomeration. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle based in the former Intendant Palace. In addition, Metz is the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region, hosted in the former Saint-Clement Abbey.\n\n\n=== City administrative divisions ===\n\nThe city of Metz is divided into 14 administrative divisions:\n\n\n== Cityscape and environmental policy ==\n\nMetz contains a mishmash of architectural layers, bearing witness to centuries of history at the crossroads of different cultures, and features a number of architectural landmarks. The city possesses one of the largest Urban Conservation Areas in France, and more than 100 of the city's buildings are classified on the Monument Historique list. Because of its historical and cultural background, Metz is designated as French Town of Art and History, and has been submitted on to France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List.The city is famous for its yellow limestone architecture, a result of the extensive use of Jaumont stone. The historic district has kept part of the Gallo-Roman city with Divodurum's Cardo Maximus, then called Via Scarponensis (today the Trinitaires, Taison, and Serpenoise streets), and the Decumanus Maximus (today En Fournirue and d'Estr\u00e9es streets). At the Cardo and Decumanus intersection was situated the Roman forum, today the Saint-Jacques Square.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nFrom its Gallo-Roman past, the city preserves vestiges of the thermae (in the basement of the Golden Courtyard museum), parts of the aqueduct, and the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains.Saint Louis' square with its vaulted arcades and a Knights Templar chapel remains a major symbol of the city's High Medieval heritage. The Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral, several churches and H\u00f4tels, and two remarkable municipal granaries reflect the Late Middle Ages. Examples of Renaissance architecture can be seen in H\u00f4tels from the 16th century, such as the House of Heads (French: Maison des T\u00eates).The city hall and the buildings surrounding the town square are by French architect Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Blondel, who was awarded the task of redesigning and modernizing the centre of Metz by the Royal Academy of Architecture in 1755 the context of the Enlightenment. Neoclassical buildings from the 18th century, such as the Opera House, the Intendant Palace (the present-day prefecture), and the Royal Governor's Palace (the present-day courthouse) built by Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau, are also found in the city.The Imperial District was built during the first annexation of Metz by the German Empire. In order to \"germanise\" the city, Emperor Wilhelm II decided to create a new district shaped by a distinctive blend of Germanic architecture, including Renaissance, neo-Romanesque and neo-Classical, mixed with elements of Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Alsatian and mock-Bavarian styles. Instead of Jaumont stone, commonly used everywhere else in the city, stone used in the Rhineland, such as pink and grey sandstone, granite and basalt were used. The district features noteworthy buildings including the rail station and the Central Post Office by German architect J\u00fcrgen Kr\u00f6ger.Modern architecture can also be seen in the town with works of French architects Roger-Henri Expert (Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-de-l'Enfant-J\u00e9sus church, 1934), Georges-Henri Pingusson (Fire Station, 1960), and Jean Dubuisson (subdivisions, 1960s). The refurbishment of the former Ney Arsenal as a Concert Hall in 1989 and the erection of the Metz Arena in 2002, by Spanish and French architects Ricardo Bofill and French Paul Chemetov represent the Postmodern movement.The Centre Pompidou-Metz museum in the Amphitheatre District represents a strong architectural initiative to mark the entrance of Metz into the 21st century. Designed by Japanese architect Shigeru Ban, the building is remarkable for the complex, innovative carpentry of its roof, and integrates concepts of sustainable architecture. The project encompasses the architecture of two recipients of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, Shigeru Ban (2014) and French Christian de Portzamparc (1994). The Amphitheatre District is also conceived by French architects Nicolas Michelin, Jean-Paul Viguier, and Jean-Michel Wilmotte and designer Philippe Starck. The urban project is expected to be completed by 2023. Further, a contemporary music venue designed by contextualist French architect Rudy Ricciotti stands in the Borny District.\n\n\n=== Urban ecology ===\n\nUnder the leadership of such people as botanist Jean-Marie Pelt, Metz pioneered a policy of urban ecology during the early 1970s. Because of the failure of post-war urban planning and housing estate development in Europe during the 1960s, mostly based on the concepts of CIAM, Jean-Marie Pelt, then municipal councillor of Metz, initiated a new approach to the urban environment.Based initially on the ideas of the Chicago School, Pelt's theories pleaded for better integration of humans into their environment and developed a concept centered on the relationship between \"stone and water\". His policy was realized in Metz by the establishment of extensive open areas surrounding the Moselle and the Seille rivers and the development of large pedestrian areas. As a result, Metz has over 37 m2 (400 sq ft) of open areas per inhabitant in the form of numerous public gardens in the city.The principles of urban ecology are still applied in Metz with the implementation of a local Agenda 21 action plan. The municipal ecological policy encompasses the sustainable refurbishment of ancient buildings, the erection of sustainable districts and buildings, green public transport, and the creation of public gardens by means of landscape architecture.Additionally, the city has developed its own combined heat and power station, using waste wood biomass from the surrounding forests as a renewable energy source. With a thermal efficiency above 80%, the 45MW boiler of the plant provides electricity and heat for 44,000 dwellings. The Metz power station is the first local producer and distributor of energy in France.\n\n\n=== Military architecture ===\n\nAs a historic Garrison town, Metz has been heavily influenced by military architecture throughout its history. From ancient history to the present, the city has been successively fortified and modified to accommodate the troops stationed there. Defensive walls from classical antiquity to the 20th century are still visible today, incorporated into the design of public gardens along the Moselle and Seille rivers. A medieval bridge castle from the 13th century, named Germans' Gate (French: Porte des Allemands), today converted into a convention and exhibition centre, has become one of the landmarks of the city. It is still possible to see parts of the 16th century citadel, as well as fortifications built in the 1740s by Louis de Cormontaigne but based on designs by Vauban. Important barracks, mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries, are spread around the city: some, which are of architectural interest, have been converted to civilian use, such as the Arsenal Concert Hall by Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill.\nThe extensive fortifications of Metz, which ring the city, include early examples of S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res system forts. Other forts were incorporated into the Maginot Line. A hiking trail on the Saint-Quentin plateau passes through a former military training zone and ends at the now abandoned military forts, providing a vantage point from which to survey the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAlthough the steel industry has historically dominated Moselle's economy, Metz's efforts at economic diversification have created a base in the sectors of commerce, tourism, information technology and the automotive industry. The city is the economic heart of the Lorraine region and around 73,000 people work daily within the urban agglomeration. The transport facilities found in the conurbation, including the international high-speed railway, motorway, inland connections and the local bus rapid transit system, have made the city a transport hub in the heart of the European Union. Metz is home to the biggest harbour handling cereals in France with over 4,000,000 tons/year.Metz is home to the Moselle Chamber of Commerce. International companies such as PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, ArcelorMittal, SFR, and TDF have established plants and centres in the Metz conurbation. Metz is also the regional headquarters of the Caisse d'Epargne and Banque Populaire banking groups.\nMetz is an important commercial centre of northern France with France's biggest retailer federation, consisting of around 2,000 retailers. Important retail companies are found in the city, such as the Galeries Lafayette, the Printemps department store and the Fnac entertainment retail chain. The historic city centre displays one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France and a mall, the Saint-Jacques centre. In addition there are several multiplex movie theatres and malls found in the urban agglomeration.\nIn recent years, Metz municipality have promoted an ambitious policy of tourism development, including urban revitalization and refurbishment of buildings and public squares. This policy has been spurred by the creation of the Centre Pompidou-Metz in 2010. Since its inauguration, the institution has become the most popular cultural venue in France outside Paris, with 550,000 visitors per year. Meanwhile, Saint-Stephen Cathedral is the most visited building in the city, accommodating 652,000 visitors per year.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums and exhibition halls ===\n\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz is a museum of modern and contemporary arts, the largest temporary exhibition area in France outside Paris. The museum features exhibitions from the extensive collection of the Centre Pompidou, Europe's largest collection of 20th-century art.\nSaint Stephen's Cathedral is the Gothic cathedral of the city built during the 13th century. The cathedral exhibits the collection of the Bishopric of Metz, including paraments and items used in the service of the Eucharist. Metz Cathedral is sometimes nicknamed the Good Lord's Lantern (French: la Lanterne du Bon Dieu), as it has the largest expanse of stained glass windows in the world: 6,500 m2 (70,000 sq ft). These include works by Gothic and Renaissance master glass makers Hermann von M\u00fcnster, Th\u00e9obald of Lixheim, and Valentin Bousch, romantic Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, tachist Roger Bissi\u00e8re, cubist Jacques Villon and modernist Marc Chagall.\nAnother of the city's churches displays a complete set of stained glass windows by French modernist Jean Cocteau.In addition, Metz features other museums and exhibition venues, such as:\n\nThe FRAC Lorraine, a public collection of contemporary art of the Lorraine region. It is located in the 12th-century Saint-Liver H\u00f4tel and organizes exhibitions of local and international contemporary artists.\nThe Golden Courtyard (French: la Cour d'Or), a museum dedicated to the history of Metz, divided into four sections (e.g. archeology, medieval, architecture, and fine arts). The Golden Courtyard displays a rich collection of Gallo-Roman and medieval finds and the remains of the Gallo-Roman baths of Divodurum Mediomatricum, revealed by the extension works to the museums in the 1930s.\nThe Museum of the 1870 War and of the Annexion in Gravelotte, a village located within the Metz-Metropole conurbation and the site of the Battle of Gravelotte, the only museum in Europe dedicated to the Franco-Prussian War. The museum exhibits military and everyday items from the period as well as artworks related to the 1870 war. A mausoleum erected in 1904 honoring the soldiers who died during the battle, the Memorial Hall (French: La Halle du Souvenir), has been included in the museum.\nThe House for Europe, located on the estate of Robert Schuman in Scy-Chazelles in the Metz-Metropole conurbation, transformed into a museum and convention centre. Across the street is the fortified 12th Century church where Robert Schuman now rests. The Robert Schuman House for Europe organises cultural and educational events that introduce the visitor to Schuman's life and works and to the way Europe has been constructed and continues to develop today.\nVerlaine's House (French: la Maison de Verlaine) is a museum located in the house where the poet Paul Verlaine was born, dedicated to his work, featuring permanent and temporary exhibitions. The Solange Bertrand foundation, located in the artist's former house, conserves and displays her artworks. The municipal archives preserve and exhibit Metz's historical municipal records dating from medieval times to the present.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\nMetz has several venues for the performing arts. The Opera House of Metz, the oldest working opera house in France, features plays, dance, and lyric poetry. The Arsenal Concert Hall, dedicated to art music, is widely renowned for its excellent acoustics. The Trinitarians Club is a multi-media arts complex housed in the vaulted cellar and chapel of an ancient convent, the city's prime venue for jazz music. The Music Box (French: Boite \u00e0 Musique), familiarly known as BAM, is the concert venue dedicated to rock and electronic music. The Braun Hall and the Kolt\u00e8s Theater feature plays, and the city has two movie theaters specializing in Auteur cinema. The Saint-Jacques Square, surrounded by busy bars and pubs whose open-air tables fill the centre of the square.\nSince 2014, the former bus garage has been converted to accommodate over thirty artists in residence, in a space where they can create and rehearse artworks and even build set decorations. The artistic complex, called Metz Network of All Cultures (French: Toutes les Cultures en R\u00e9seau \u00e0 Metz) and familiarly known as TCRM-Blida, encompasses a large hall of 3,000 m2 (32,000 sq ft) while theater and dance companies benefit from a studio of 800 m2 (8,600 sq ft) with backstages.\n\n\n=== Metz in the arts ===\nMetz was an important cultural centre during the Carolingian Renaissance. For instance, Gregorian chant was created in Metz during the 8th century as a fusion of Gallican and ancient Roman repertory. Then called Messin Chant, it remains the oldest form of music still in use in Western Europe. The bishops of Metz, notably Saint-Chrodegang promoted its use for the Roman liturgy in Gallic lands under the favorable influence of the Carolingian monarchs. Messin chant made two major contributions to the body of chant: it fitted the chant into the ancient Greek octoechos system, and invented an innovative musical notation, using neumes to show the shape of a remembered melody. Metz was also an important centre of illumination of Carolingian manuscripts, producing such monuments of Carolingian book illumination as the Drogo Sacramentary.The Metz School (French: \u00c9cole de Metz) was an art movement in Metz and the region between 1834 and 1870, centred on Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal. The term was originally proposed in 1845 by the poet Charles Baudelaire, who appreciated the works of the artists. They were influenced by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix and inspired by the medieval heritage of Metz and its romantic surroundings. The Franco-Prussian War and the annexation of the territory by the Germans resulted in the dismantling of the movement. The main figures of the Metz School were Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, Auguste Migette, Auguste Hussenot, Louis-Th\u00e9odore Devilly, Christopher Fratin, and Charles P\u00eatre. Their works include paintings, engravings, drawings, stained-glass windows, and sculptures.\nA festival named \"passages\" takes place in May. Numerous shows are presented to it.\n\n\n=== The Graoully dragon as symbol of the city ===\n\nThe Graoully is depicted as a fearsome dragon, vanquished by the sacred powers of Saint Clement of Metz, the first Bishop of the city. The Graoully quickly became a symbol of Metz and can be seen in numerous insignia of the city, from the 10th century on. Writers from Metz tend to present the legend as an allegory of Christianity's victory over paganism, represented by the harmful dragon.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nLocal specialties include the quiche, the pot\u00e9e, the Lorrain p\u00e2t\u00e9, and also suckling pig. Different recipes, such as jam, tart, charcuterie and fruit brandy, are made from the Mirabelle and Damson plums. Also, Metz is the cradle of some pastries like the Metz cheese pie and the Metz Balls (French: boulet de Metz), a ganache-stuffed biscuit coated with marzipan, caramel, and dark chocolate. Local beverages include Moselle wine and Amos beer.The Covered Market of Metz is one of the oldest, most grandiose in France and is home to traditional local food producers and retailers. Originally built as the bishop's palace, the French Revolution broke out before the Bishop of Metz could move in and the citizens decided to turn it into a food market. The adjacent Chamber's Square (French: Place de la Chambre) is surrounded by numerous local food restaurants.\n\n\n=== Celebrations and events ===\nMany events are celebrated in Metz throughout the year. The city of Metz dedicates two weeks to the Mirabelle plum during the popular Mirabelle Festival held in August. During the festival, in addition to open markets selling fresh plums, mirabelle tarts, and mirabelle liquor, there are live music, fireworks, parties, art exhibits, a parade with floral floats, a competition, the crowning of the Mirabelle Queen and a gala of celebration.A literature festival is held in June. The Montgolfiades hot air balloon festival is organized in September. The second most popular Christmas Market in France is held in November and December. Finally, a Saint Nicholas parade honors the patron saint of the Lorraine region in December.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nMetz is home to the Football Club of Metz (FC Metz), a football association club in Ligue 1, the highest division of French football (as of 2019\u20132020 season). FC Metz has won three times the Ligue 2 (1935, 2007, and 2014), twice the Coupe de France (in 1984 and 1988) and the French League Cup (in 1986 and 1996), and was French championship runner-up in 1998. FC Metz has also gained recognition in France and Europe for its successful youth academy, winning the Gambardella Cup 3 times in 1981, 2001, and 2010. The Saint-Symphorien stadium has been the home of FC Metz since the creation of the club.\nMetz Handball is a Handball club. Metz Handball has won the French Women's First League championship 23 times, the Women's France Cup nine times, and the French Women's League Cup eight times. The Metz Arena has been the home of Metz Handball since 2002.\nSince 2003, Metz has been home to the Moselle Open, an ATP World Tour 250 tournament played on indoor hard courts, which usually takes place in September.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== High schools ===\nMetz has numerous high schools, including the Fabert High School and the Lyc\u00e9e of Communication. Some of these institutions offer higher education programs such as classes pr\u00e9paratoires (undergraduate school) or BTS (technician certificate).\n\n\n=== University of Lorraine ===\n\nMetz is also home to the University of Lorraine (often abbreviated as UdL).  \nThe university is divided into two university centers, one in Metz (material sciences, technology, and management) and one in Nancy (biological sciences, health care, administration, and management). The University of Lorraine, which ranks in 2016 among the top 15 of French universities and among the top 300 of universities in the world according to the 2016 Academic Ranking of World Universities, \n has a student body of over 55,000 and offers 101 accredited research centers organized in 9 research areas and 8 doctoral colleges.\n\n\n=== Graduate schools ===\nAt the end of the 1990s, the city expanded and the Metz Science Park was created in the southern area. Along with this expansion, several graduate schools took the opportunity to establish campuses in the park. At first, facilities were grouped around the lake Symphony, like Sup\u00e9lec in 1985 and Georgia Tech Lorraine in 1990. In 1996, the engineering school Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech (ENSAM) built a research and learning center next to the golf course. This opened the way to the development of a new area, where the Franco-German university (ISFATES) and the ENIM moved in 2010. These graduate schools often cooperate with the University of Lorraine. For instance, the university and ENSAM share research teams, laboratories, equipments, and doctoral programs.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\nPublic transport includes a bus rapid transit system, called Mettis. Mettis vehicles are high-capacity hybrid bi-articulated buses built by Van Hool, and stop at designated elevated tubes, complete with disability access. Mettis has its own planned and integrated transportation system, which includes two dedicated lines that spread out into the Metz conurbation. Mettis lanes A and B serve the city's major facilities (e.g., city centre, university campus, and hospitals), and a transport hub is located next to the railway station.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nMetz Railway Station is connected to the French high speed train (TGV) network, which provides a direct rail service to Paris and Luxembourg.

        "wiki": "Metz ( METS, French: [m\u025bs] (listen), Lorraine Franconian: [m\u025bts]) Latin: Divodurum Mediomatricorum is a city in northeast France located at the confluence of the Moselle and the Seille rivers. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle department and the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region. Located near the tripoint along the junction of France, Germany, and Luxembourg, the city forms a central place of the European Greater Region and the SaarLorLux euroregion.Metz has a rich 3,000-year-history, having variously been a Celtic oppidum, an important Gallo-Roman city, the Merovingian capital of Austrasia, the birthplace of the Carolingian dynasty, a cradle of the Gregorian chant, and one of the oldest republics in Europe. The city has been steeped in Romance culture, but has been strongly influenced by Germanic culture due to its location and history.Because of its historical, cultural, and architectural background, Metz has been submitted on France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. The city features noteworthy buildings such as the Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral with its largest expanse of stained-glass windows in the world, the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains being the oldest church in France, its Imperial Station Palace displaying the apartment of the German Kaiser, or its Opera House, the oldest one working in France. Metz is home to some world-class venues including the Arsenal Concert Hall and the Centre Pompidou-Metz museum.\nA basin of urban ecology, Metz gained its nickname of The Green City (French: La Ville Verte), as it has extensive open grounds and public gardens. The historic city centre is one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France.A historic garrison town, Metz is the economic heart of the Lorraine region, specialising in information technology and automotive industries. Metz is home to the University of Lorraine, Georgia Tech Lorraine, and a centre for applied research and development in the materials sector, notably in metallurgy and metallography, the heritage of the Lorraine region's past in the iron and steel industry.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn ancient times, the town was known as \"city of Mediomatrici\", being inhabited by the tribe of the same name. After its integration into the Roman Empire, the city was called Divodurum Mediomatricum, meaning Holy Village or Holy Fortress of the Mediomatrici, then it was known as Mediomatrix. During the 5th century AD, the name evolved to \"Mettis\", which gave rise to Metz.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMetz has a recorded history dating back over 2,000 years. Before the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar in 52 BC, it was the oppidum of the Celtic Mediomatrici tribe. Integrated into the Roman Empire, Metz became quickly one of the principal towns of Gaul with a population of 40,000, until the barbarian depredations and its transfer to the Franks about the end of the 5th century. Between the 6th and 8th centuries, the city was the residence of the Merovingian kings of Austrasia. After the Treaty of Verdun in 843, Metz became the capital of the Kingdom of Lotharingia and was ultimately integrated into the Holy Roman Empire, being granted semi-independent status. During the 12th century, Metz became a republic and the Republic of Metz stood until the 15th century.With the signature of the Treaty of Chambord in 1552, Metz passed to the hands of the Kings of France. As the German Protestant Princes who traded Metz (alongside Toul and Verdun) for the promise of French military assistance, had no authority to cede territory of the Holy Roman Empire, the change of jurisdiction wasn't recognised by the Holy Roman Empire until the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. Under French rule, Metz was selected as capital of the Three Bishoprics and became a strategic fortified town. With creation of the departments by the Estates-General of 1789, Metz was chosen as capital of the Department of Moselle. Although French-speaking, after the Franco-Prussian War and according to the Treaty of Frankfurt of 1871, the city was annexed into the German Empire, being part of the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine and serving as capital of the Bezirk Lothringen.Metz remained German until the end of World War I, when it reverted to France. However, after the Battle of France during the Second World War, the city was annexed once more by the German Third Reich. In 1944, the attack on the city by the U.S. Third Army freed the city from German rule and Metz reverted one more time to France after World War II.During the 1950s, Metz was chosen to be the capital of the newly created Lorraine region. With the creation of the European Community and the later European Union, the city has become central to the Greater Region and the SaarLorLux Euroregion.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMetz is located on the banks of the Moselle and the Seille rivers, 43 km (26.7 mi) from the Schengen tripoint where the borders of France, Germany, and Luxembourg meet. The city was built in a place where many branches of the Moselle river creates several islands, which are encompassed within the urban planning.The terrain of Metz forms part of the Paris Basin and presents a plateau relief cut by river valleys presenting cuestas in the north\u2013south direction. Metz and its surrounding countryside are included in the forest and crop Lorraine Regional Natural Park, covering a total area of 205,000 ha (506,566.0 acres).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of Lorraine is a semi-continental climate. The summers are warm and humid, sometimes stormy, and the warmest month of the year is July, when daytime temperatures average approximately 25 \u00b0C (77.0 \u00b0F). The winters are cold and snowy with temperature dropping to an average low of \u22120.5 \u00b0C (31.1 \u00b0F) in January. Lows can be much colder through the night and early morning and the snowy period extends from November to February.The length of the day varies significantly over the course of the year. The shortest day is 21 December with 7:30 hours of sunlight; the longest day is 20 June with 16:30 hours of sunlight. The median cloud cover is 93% and does not vary substantially over the course of the year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nThe inhabitants of Metz are called Messin(e)s. Statistics on the ethnic and religious make up of the population of Metz are haphazard, as the French Republic prohibits making distinctions between citizens regarding race, beliefs, and political and philosophic opinions in the process of census taking. This would otherwise document the city to be a Germanic locale, as is the rest of the province and the neighboring Alsace.The French national census of 2012 estimated the population of Metz to be 119,551, while the population of Metz urban agglomeration was about 389,851. Through history, Metz's population has been impacted by the vicissitudes of the wars and annexations involving the city, which have prevented continuous population growth. More recently, the city has suffered from the restructuring of the military and the metallurgy industry. The historical population for the current area of Metz municipality is as follows:\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\nSeveral well-known figures have been linked to the city of Metz throughout its history. Renowned Messins include poet Paul Verlaine, composer Ambroise Thomas, and mathematician Jean-Victor Poncelet; numerous well-known German figures were also born in Metz notably during the annexation periods. Moreover, the city has been the residence of people such as writer Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Cardinal Mazarin, political thinker Alexis de Tocqueville, French patriot and American Revolutionary War hero Marquis Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette, and Luxembourg-born German-French statesman Robert Schuman.\n\n\n== Law and government ==\n\n\n=== Local law ===\n\nThe Local Law (French: droit local) applied in Metz is a legal system that operates in parallel with French law. Created in 1919, it preserves the French laws applied in France before 1870 and maintained by the Germans during the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, but repealed in the rest of France after 1871. It also maintains German laws enacted by the German Empire between 1871 and 1918, specific provisions adopted by the local authorities, and French laws that have been enacted after 1919 to be applicable only in Alsace-Lorraine. This specific local legislation encompasses different areas including religion, social work and finance.\nThe most striking of the legal differences between France and Alsace-Lorraine is the absence in Alsace-Lorraine of strict secularism, even though a constitutional right of freedom of religion is guaranteed by the French government. Alsace-Lorraine is still governed by a pre-1905 law established by the Concordat of 1801, which provides for the public subsidy of the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches and the Jewish religion.\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\nLike every commune of the present French Republic, Metz is managed by a mayor (French: maire) and a municipal council (French: conseil municipal), democratically elected by two-round proportional voting for six years. The mayor is assisted by 54 municipal councillors, and the municipal council is held on the last Thursday of every month. Since 2008, the mayor of Metz has been socialist Dominique Gros.The city belongs to the Metz Metropole union of cities, which includes the 40 cities of the Metz urban agglomeration. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle based in the former Intendant Palace. In addition, Metz is the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region, hosted in the former Saint-Clement Abbey.\n\n\n=== City administrative divisions ===\n\nThe city of Metz is divided into 14 administrative divisions:\n\n\n== Cityscape and environmental policy ==\n\nMetz contains a mishmash of architectural layers, bearing witness to centuries of history at the crossroads of different cultures, and features a number of architectural landmarks. The city possesses one of the largest Urban Conservation Areas in France, and more than 100 of the city's buildings are classified on the Monument Historique list. Because of its historical and cultural background, Metz is designated as French Town of Art and History, and has been submitted on to France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List.The city is famous for its yellow limestone architecture, a result of the extensive use of Jaumont stone. The historic district has kept part of the Gallo-Roman city with Divodurum's Cardo Maximus, then called Via Scarponensis (today the Trinitaires, Taison, and Serpenoise streets), and the Decumanus Maximus (today En Fournirue and d'Estr\u00e9es streets). At the Cardo and Decumanus intersection was situated the Roman forum, today the Saint-Jacques Square.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nFrom its Gallo-Roman past, the city preserves vestiges of the thermae (in the basement of the Golden Courtyard museum), parts of the aqueduct, and the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains.Saint Louis' square with its vaulted arcades and a Knights Templar chapel remains a major symbol of the city's High Medieval heritage. The Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral, several churches and H\u00f4tels, and two remarkable municipal granaries reflect the Late Middle Ages. Examples of Renaissance architecture can be seen in H\u00f4tels from the 16th century, such as the House of Heads (French: Maison des T\u00eates).The city hall and the buildings surrounding the town square are by French architect Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Blondel, who was awarded the task of redesigning and modernizing the centre of Metz by the Royal Academy of Architecture in 1755 the context of the Enlightenment. Neoclassical buildings from the 18th century, such as the Opera House, the Intendant Palace (the present-day prefecture), and the Royal Governor's Palace (the present-day courthouse) built by Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau, are also found in the city.The Imperial District was built during the first annexation of Metz by the German Empire. In order to \"germanise\" the city, Emperor Wilhelm II decided to create a new district shaped by a distinctive blend of Germanic architecture, including Renaissance, neo-Romanesque and neo-Classical, mixed with elements of Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Alsatian and mock-Bavarian styles. Instead of Jaumont stone, commonly used everywhere else in the city, stone used in the Rhineland, such as pink and grey sandstone, granite and basalt were used. The district features noteworthy buildings including the rail station and the Central Post Office by German architect J\u00fcrgen Kr\u00f6ger.Modern architecture can also be seen in the town with works of French architects Roger-Henri Expert (Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-de-l'Enfant-J\u00e9sus church, 1934), Georges-Henri Pingusson (Fire Station, 1960), and Jean Dubuisson (subdivisions, 1960s). The refurbishment of the former Ney Arsenal as a Concert Hall in 1989 and the erection of the Metz Arena in 2002, by Spanish and French architects Ricardo Bofill and French Paul Chemetov represent the Postmodern movement.The Centre Pompidou-Metz museum in the Amphitheatre District represents a strong architectural initiative to mark the entrance of Metz into the 21st century. Designed by Japanese architect Shigeru Ban, the building is remarkable for the complex, innovative carpentry of its roof, and integrates concepts of sustainable architecture. The project encompasses the architecture of two recipients of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, Shigeru Ban (2014) and French Christian de Portzamparc (1994). The Amphitheatre District is also conceived by French architects Nicolas Michelin, Jean-Paul Viguier, and Jean-Michel Wilmotte and designer Philippe Starck. The urban project is expected to be completed by 2023. Further, a contemporary music venue designed by contextualist French architect Rudy Ricciotti stands in the Borny District.\n\n\n=== Urban ecology ===\n\nUnder the leadership of such people as botanist Jean-Marie Pelt, Metz pioneered a policy of urban ecology during the early 1970s. Because of the failure of post-war urban planning and housing estate development in Europe during the 1960s, mostly based on the concepts of CIAM, Jean-Marie Pelt, then municipal councillor of Metz, initiated a new approach to the urban environment.Based initially on the ideas of the Chicago School, Pelt's theories pleaded for better integration of humans into their environment and developed a concept centered on the relationship between \"stone and water\". His policy was realized in Metz by the establishment of extensive open areas surrounding the Moselle and the Seille rivers and the development of large pedestrian areas. As a result, Metz has over 37 m2 (400 sq ft) of open areas per inhabitant in the form of numerous public gardens in the city.The principles of urban ecology are still applied in Metz with the implementation of a local Agenda 21 action plan. The municipal ecological policy encompasses the sustainable refurbishment of ancient buildings, the erection of sustainable districts and buildings, green public transport, and the creation of public gardens by means of landscape architecture.Additionally, the city has developed its own combined heat and power station, using waste wood biomass from the surrounding forests as a renewable energy source. With a thermal efficiency above 80%, the 45MW boiler of the plant provides electricity and heat for 44,000 dwellings. The Metz power station is the first local producer and distributor of energy in France.\n\n\n=== Military architecture ===\n\nAs a historic Garrison town, Metz has been heavily influenced by military architecture throughout its history. From ancient history to the present, the city has been successively fortified and modified to accommodate the troops stationed there. Defensive walls from classical antiquity to the 20th century are still visible today, incorporated into the design of public gardens along the Moselle and Seille rivers. A medieval bridge castle from the 13th century, named Germans' Gate (French: Porte des Allemands), today converted into a convention and exhibition centre, has become one of the landmarks of the city. It is still possible to see parts of the 16th century citadel, as well as fortifications built in the 1740s by Louis de Cormontaigne but based on designs by Vauban. Important barracks, mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries, are spread around the city: some, which are of architectural interest, have been converted to civilian use, such as the Arsenal Concert Hall by Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill.\nThe extensive fortifications of Metz, which ring the city, include early examples of S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res system forts. Other forts were incorporated into the Maginot Line. A hiking trail on the Saint-Quentin plateau passes through a former military training zone and ends at the now abandoned military forts, providing a vantage point from which to survey the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAlthough the steel industry has historically dominated Moselle's economy, Metz's efforts at economic diversification have created a base in the sectors of commerce, tourism, information technology and the automotive industry. The city is the economic heart of the Lorraine region and around 73,000 people work daily within the urban agglomeration. The transport facilities found in the conurbation, including the international high-speed railway, motorway, inland connections and the local bus rapid transit system, have made the city a transport hub in the heart of the European Union. Metz is home to the biggest harbour handling cereals in France with over 4,000,000 tons/year.Metz is home to the Moselle Chamber of Commerce. International companies such as PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, ArcelorMittal, SFR, and TDF have established plants and centres in the Metz conurbation. Metz is also the regional headquarters of the Caisse d'Epargne and Banque Populaire banking groups.\nMetz is an important commercial centre of northern France with France's biggest retailer federation, consisting of around 2,000 retailers. Important retail companies are found in the city, such as the Galeries Lafayette, the Printemps department store and the Fnac entertainment retail chain. The historic city centre displays one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France and a mall, the Saint-Jacques centre. In addition there are several multiplex movie theatres and malls found in the urban agglomeration.\nIn recent years, Metz municipality have promoted an ambitious policy of tourism development, including urban revitalization and refurbishment of buildings and public squares. This policy has been spurred by the creation of the Centre Pompidou-Metz in 2010. Since its inauguration, the institution has become the most popular cultural venue in France outside Paris, with 550,000 visitors per year. Meanwhile, Saint-Stephen Cathedral is the most visited building in the city, accommodating 652,000 visitors per year.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums and exhibition halls ===\n\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz is a museum of modern and contemporary arts, the largest temporary exhibition area in France outside Paris. The museum features exhibitions from the extensive collection of the Centre Pompidou, Europe's largest collection of 20th-century art.\nSaint Stephen's Cathedral is the Gothic cathedral of the city built during the 13th century. The cathedral exhibits the collection of the Bishopric of Metz, including paraments and items used in the service of the Eucharist. Metz Cathedral is sometimes nicknamed the Good Lord's Lantern (French: la Lanterne du Bon Dieu), as it has the largest expanse of stained glass windows in the world: 6,500 m2 (70,000 sq ft). These include works by Gothic and Renaissance master glass makers Hermann von M\u00fcnster, Th\u00e9obald of Lixheim, and Valentin Bousch, romantic Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, tachist Roger Bissi\u00e8re, cubist Jacques Villon and modernist Marc Chagall.\nAnother of the city's churches displays a complete set of stained glass windows by French modernist Jean Cocteau.In addition, Metz features other museums and exhibition venues, such as:\n\nThe FRAC Lorraine, a public collection of contemporary art of the Lorraine region. It is located in the 12th-century Saint-Liver H\u00f4tel and organizes exhibitions of local and international contemporary artists.\nThe Golden Courtyard (French: la Cour d'Or), a museum dedicated to the history of Metz, divided into four sections (e.g. archeology, medieval, architecture, and fine arts). The Golden Courtyard displays a rich collection of Gallo-Roman and medieval finds and the remains of the Gallo-Roman baths of Divodurum Mediomatricum, revealed by the extension works to the museums in the 1930s.\nThe Museum of the 1870 War and of the Annexion in Gravelotte, a village located within the Metz-Metropole conurbation and the site of the Battle of Gravelotte, the only museum in Europe dedicated to the Franco-Prussian War. The museum exhibits military and everyday items from the period as well as artworks related to the 1870 war. A mausoleum erected in 1904 honoring the soldiers who died during the battle, the Memorial Hall (French: La Halle du Souvenir), has been included in the museum.\nThe House for Europe, located on the estate of Robert Schuman in Scy-Chazelles in the Metz-Metropole conurbation, transformed into a museum and convention centre. Across the street is the fortified 12th Century church where Robert Schuman now rests. The Robert Schuman House for Europe organises cultural and educational events that introduce the visitor to Schuman's life and works and to the way Europe has been constructed and continues to develop today.\nVerlaine's House (French: la Maison de Verlaine) is a museum located in the house where the poet Paul Verlaine was born, dedicated to his work, featuring permanent and temporary exhibitions. The Solange Bertrand foundation, located in the artist's former house, conserves and displays her artworks. The municipal archives preserve and exhibit Metz's historical municipal records dating from medieval times to the present.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\nMetz has several venues for the performing arts. The Opera House of Metz, the oldest working opera house in France, features plays, dance, and lyric poetry. The Arsenal Concert Hall, dedicated to art music, is widely renowned for its excellent acoustics. The Trinitarians Club is a multi-media arts complex housed in the vaulted cellar and chapel of an ancient convent, the city's prime venue for jazz music. The Music Box (French: Boite \u00e0 Musique), familiarly known as BAM, is the concert venue dedicated to rock and electronic music. The Braun Hall and the Kolt\u00e8s Theater feature plays, and the city has two movie theaters specializing in Auteur cinema. The Saint-Jacques Square, surrounded by busy bars and pubs whose open-air tables fill the centre of the square.\nSince 2014, the former bus garage has been converted to accommodate over thirty artists in residence, in a space where they can create and rehearse artworks and even build set decorations. The artistic complex, called Metz Network of All Cultures (French: Toutes les Cultures en R\u00e9seau \u00e0 Metz) and familiarly known as TCRM-Blida, encompasses a large hall of 3,000 m2 (32,000 sq ft) while theater and dance companies benefit from a studio of 800 m2 (8,600 sq ft) with backstages.\n\n\n=== Metz in the arts ===\nMetz was an important cultural centre during the Carolingian Renaissance. For instance, Gregorian chant was created in Metz during the 8th century as a fusion of Gallican and ancient Roman repertory. Then called Messin Chant, it remains the oldest form of music still in use in Western Europe. The bishops of Metz, notably Saint-Chrodegang promoted its use for the Roman liturgy in Gallic lands under the favorable influence of the Carolingian monarchs. Messin chant made two major contributions to the body of chant: it fitted the chant into the ancient Greek octoechos system, and invented an innovative musical notation, using neumes to show the shape of a remembered melody. Metz was also an important centre of illumination of Carolingian manuscripts, producing such monuments of Carolingian book illumination as the Drogo Sacramentary.The Metz School (French: \u00c9cole de Metz) was an art movement in Metz and the region between 1834 and 1870, centred on Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal. The term was originally proposed in 1845 by the poet Charles Baudelaire, who appreciated the works of the artists. They were influenced by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix and inspired by the medieval heritage of Metz and its romantic surroundings. The Franco-Prussian War and the annexation of the territory by the Germans resulted in the dismantling of the movement. The main figures of the Metz School were Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, Auguste Migette, Auguste Hussenot, Louis-Th\u00e9odore Devilly, Christopher Fratin, and Charles P\u00eatre. Their works include paintings, engravings, drawings, stained-glass windows, and sculptures.\nA festival named \"passages\" takes place in May. Numerous shows are presented to it.\n\n\n=== The Graoully dragon as symbol of the city ===\n\nThe Graoully is depicted as a fearsome dragon, vanquished by the sacred powers of Saint Clement of Metz, the first Bishop of the city. The Graoully quickly became a symbol of Metz and can be seen in numerous insignia of the city, from the 10th century on. Writers from Metz tend to present the legend as an allegory of Christianity's victory over paganism, represented by the harmful dragon.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nLocal specialties include the quiche, the pot\u00e9e, the Lorrain p\u00e2t\u00e9, and also suckling pig. Different recipes, such as jam, tart, charcuterie and fruit brandy, are made from the Mirabelle and Damson plums. Also, Metz is the cradle of some pastries like the Metz cheese pie and the Metz Balls (French: boulet de Metz), a ganache-stuffed biscuit coated with marzipan, caramel, and dark chocolate. Local beverages include Moselle wine and Amos beer.The Covered Market of Metz is one of the oldest, most grandiose in France and is home to traditional local food producers and retailers. Originally built as the bishop's palace, the French Revolution broke out before the Bishop of Metz could move in and the citizens decided to turn it into a food market. The adjacent Chamber's Square (French: Place de la Chambre) is surrounded by numerous local food restaurants.\n\n\n=== Celebrations and events ===\nMany events are celebrated in Metz throughout the year. The city of Metz dedicates two weeks to the Mirabelle plum during the popular Mirabelle Festival held in August. During the festival, in addition to open markets selling fresh plums, mirabelle tarts, and mirabelle liquor, there are live music, fireworks, parties, art exhibits, a parade with floral floats, a competition, the crowning of the Mirabelle Queen and a gala of celebration.A literature festival is held in June. The Montgolfiades hot air balloon festival is organized in September. The second most popular Christmas Market in France is held in November and December. Finally, a Saint Nicholas parade honors the patron saint of the Lorraine region in December.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nMetz is home to the Football Club of Metz (FC Metz), a football association club in Ligue 1, the highest division of French football (as of 2019\u20132020 season). FC Metz has won three times the Ligue 2 (1935, 2007, and 2014), twice the Coupe de France (in 1984 and 1988) and the French League Cup (in 1986 and 1996), and was French championship runner-up in 1998. FC Metz has also gained recognition in France and Europe for its successful youth academy, winning the Gambardella Cup 3 times in 1981, 2001, and 2010. The Saint-Symphorien stadium has been the home of FC Metz since the creation of the club.\nMetz Handball is a Handball club. Metz Handball has won the French Women's First League championship 23 times, the Women's France Cup nine times, and the French Women's League Cup eight times. The Metz Arena has been the home of Metz Handball since 2002.\nSince 2003, Metz has been home to the Moselle Open, an ATP World Tour 250 tournament played on indoor hard courts, which usually takes place in September.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== High schools ===\nMetz has numerous high schools, including the Fabert High School and the Lyc\u00e9e of Communication. Some of these institutions offer higher education programs such as classes pr\u00e9paratoires (undergraduate school) or BTS (technician certificate).\n\n\n=== University of Lorraine ===\n\nMetz is also home to the University of Lorraine (often abbreviated as UdL).  \nThe university is divided into two university centers, one in Metz (material sciences, technology, and management) and one in Nancy (biological sciences, health care, administration, and management). The University of Lorraine, which ranks in 2016 among the top 15 of French universities and among the top 300 of universities in the world according to the 2016 Academic Ranking of World Universities, \n has a student body of over 55,000 and offers 101 accredited research centers organized in 9 research areas and 8 doctoral colleges.\n\n\n=== Graduate schools ===\nAt the end of the 1990s, the city expanded and the Metz Science Park was created in the southern area. Along with this expansion, several graduate schools took the opportunity to establish campuses in the park. At first, facilities were grouped around the lake Symphony, like Sup\u00e9lec in 1985 and Georgia Tech Lorraine in 1990. In 1996, the engineering school Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech (ENSAM) built a research and learning center next to the golf course. This opened the way to the development of a new area, where the Franco-German university (ISFATES) and the ENIM moved in 2010. These graduate schools often cooperate with the University of Lorraine. For instance, the university and ENSAM share research teams, laboratories, equipments, and doctoral programs.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\nPublic transport includes a bus rapid transit system, called Mettis. Mettis vehicles are high-capacity hybrid bi-articulated buses built by Van Hool, and stop at designated elevated tubes, complete with disability access. Mettis has its own planned and integrated transportation system, which includes two dedicated lines that spread out into the Metz conurbation. Mettis lanes A and B serve the city's major facilities (e.g., city centre, university campus, and hospitals), and a transport hub is located next to the railway station.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nMetz Railway Station is connected to the French high speed train (TGV) network, which provides a direct rail service to Paris and Luxembourg. The time from Paris (Gare de l'Est) to Metz is 82 minutes. Additionally, Metz is served by the Lorraine TGV railway station, located at Louvigny, 25 km (16 mi) to the south of Metz, for high speed trains going to Nantes, Rennes, Lille and Bordeaux (without stopping in Paris). Also, Metz is one of the main stations of the regional express trains system, M\u00e9trolor.\n\n\n=== Motorways ===\nMetz is located at the intersection of two major road axes: the Eastern Motorway, itself a part of the European route E50 connecting Paris to Prague, and the A31 Motorway, which goes north to Luxembourg and south to the Mediterranean Sea towards Nancy, Dijon, and Lyon.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nThe Luxembourg International Airport is the nearest international airport, connected to Metz by M\u00e9trolor train. The Lorraine TGV Station is 75 minutes by train from France international Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport. Finally, Metz-Nancy-Lorraine Airport is located in Goin, 16.5 km (10.25 mi) southeast of Metz..\n\n\n=== Waterways ===\n\nMetz is located at the confluence of the Moselle and the Seille rivers, both navigable waterways.

        "wiki": "The Moselle (, moh-ZEL; French: [m\u0254z\u025bl] (listen); German: Mosel [\u02c8mo\u02d0zl\u0329] (listen); Luxembourgish: Musel) is a river that flows through France, Luxembourg, and Germany. It is a left tributary of the Rhine, which it joins at Koblenz. A small part of Belgium is also drained by the Moselle through the Sauer and the Our.\nThe Moselle \"twists and turns its way between Trier and Koblenz along one of Germany's most beautiful river valleys.\" It flows through a region that has been influenced by mankind since it was first cultivated by the Romans. Today, its hillsides are covered by terraced vineyards where \"some of the best Rieslings grow\", and numerous ruined castles dominate the hilltops above wine villages and towns that line the riverbanks. Traben-Trarbach with its art nouveau architecture and Bernkastel-Kues with its traditional market square are two of the many tourist attractions on the Moselle river.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name Moselle is derived from the Celtic name form, Mosela, via the Latin Mosella, a diminutive form of Mosa, the Latin description of the Meuse, which used to flow parallel to the Moselle. So the Mosella was the \"Little Meuse\".\nThe Moselle is first recorded by Tacitus in Book 13 of his Annals and in Book 4 of his Histories.The Roman poet Ausonius made it a literary theme as early as the 4th century. In his poem dated 371, called Mosella, which was published in 483 hexameters, this poet of the Late Antiquity and teacher at the Trier Imperial Court (Kaiserhof) described a journey from Bingen over the Hunsr\u00fcck hills to the Moselle and then following its course to Trier on the road named after him, the Via Ausonius. Ausonius describes flourishing and rich landscapes along the river and in the valley of the Moselle, thanks to the policies of their Roman rulers.\nThe river subsequently gave its name to two French republican d\u00e9partements: Moselle and Meurthe-et-Moselle.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe source of the Moselle is at 715 m (2,346 ft) above sea level on the Col de Bussang on the western slopes of the Ballon d'Alsace in the Vosges. After 544 km (338 mi) it discharges into the Rhine at the Deutsches Eck in Koblenz at a height of 59 m (194 ft) above NHN sea level. The length of the river in France is 314 km (195 mi), for 39 km (24 mi) it forms the border between Germany and Luxembourg, and 208 km (129 mi) is solely within Germany.\nThe Moselle flows through the Lorraine region, west of the Vosges. Further downstream, in Germany, the Moselle valley forms the division between the Eifel and Hunsr\u00fcck mountain regions.\nThe average flow rate of the Moselle at its mouth is 328 m3/s (11,600 cu ft/s), making it the second largest tributary of the Rhine by volume after the Aare (560 m3/s, 20,000 cu ft/s) and bigger than the Main and Neckar.\n\n\n=== River sections ===\nThe section of the Moselle from the France\u2013Germany\u2013Luxembourg tripoint near Schengen to its confluence with the Saar near Konz shortly before Trier is in Germany known (geographically incorrectly) as the Upper Moselle. The section from Trier to P\u00fcnderich is the Middle Moselle, the section between P\u00fcnderich and its mouth in Koblenz as the Lower Moselle or Terraced Moselle (Terrassenmosel). Characteristic of the Middle and Lower Moselle are its wide meanders cut deeply into the highlands of the Rhenish Massif, the most striking of which is the Cochemer Krampen between Bremm and Cochem. Also typical are its vineyard terraces.\nFrom the tripoint the Moselle marks the entire Saarland\u2013Luxembourg border.\n\n\n=== Catchment ===\nThe catchment area of the Moselle is 28,286 km2 (10,921 sq mi) in area. The French part covers 15,360 km2 (5,930 sq mi), about 54 percent of the entire catchment. The German state of Rhineland-Palatinate has 6,980 km2 (2,690 sq mi), the Saarland 2,569 km2 (992 sq mi), Luxembourg 2,521 km2 (973 sq mi), Wallonia in Belgium 767 km2 (296 sq mi) and North Rhine-Westphalia, 88 km2 (34 sq mi).\n\n\n=== Tributaries ===\nThe three largest tributaries of the Moselle are, in alphabetical order, the Meurthe, the Saar and the Sauer. The Meurthe was the old upper course of the Moselle, until the latter captured the former upper reaches of the Meuse and took it over. However, the Meuse only delivered a little more water than the Meurthe at its confluence. The Saar is the biggest of all the tributaries (78.2 m3/s, 2,760 cu ft/s) as well as the longest (246 km, 153 mi). The Sauer is the largest left-hand tributary and drains the region on either side of the German-Luxembourg border. The largest tributary relative to the Moselle at its confluence is the  Moselotte, which is about 40% greater by volumetric flow and thus represents the main branch of the Moselle system. At its mouth, the Moselle delivers 328 m3/s (11,600 cu ft/s) of water into the Rhine after flowing for 544 km (338 mi).\n\n\n==== List of tributaries ====\nFrom the left\nMadon,\nTerrouin,\nEsch,\nRupt de Mad,\nOrne,\nFensch,\nGander,\nSyre,\nSauer,\nKyll,\nSalm,\nLieser,\nAlf,\nEndert,\nBrohlbach,\nElz.\n\nFrom the right\nMoselotte,\nVologne,\nMeurthe,\nSeille,\nSaar,\nOlewiger Bach,\nAvelsbach,\nRuwer,\nFeller Bach,\nDhron,\nAhringsbach,\nKautenbach,\nL\u00fctzbach,\nFlaumbach,\nAltlayer Bach,\nBaybach,\nEhrbach.\n\n\n=== Towns ===\nTowns along the Moselle are:\n\nin France: \u00c9pinal, Toul, Pont-\u00e0-Mousson, Metz and Thionville\nin Luxembourg: Schengen, Remich, Grevenmacher and Wasserbillig\nin Germany: Konz, Trier, Schweich, Bernkastel-Kues, Traben-Trarbach, Zell, Cochem and Koblenz\n\n\n=== Adjacent mountain ranges ===\nFrom Trier downstream the Moselle separates the two Central Upland ranges of the Eifel (to the northwest) and the Hunsr\u00fcck (to the southeast).\n\n\n== Geology ==\nThe Vosges, the present source region of the Moselle, were formed about 50 million years ago. In the Miocene and Pliocene epochs the ancient Moselle (Urmosel) was already a tributary of the ancient Rhine (Ur-Rhein). When, in the Quaternary period, the Rhenish Massif slowly rose, the meanders of the Moselle were formed between the Trier Valley and the Neuwied Basin.\n\n\n== Water levels ==\n\nThe highest navigable water level (HSW) is 6.95 m (22 ft 10 in) and normal level (NSt) is 2.00 m (6 ft 7 in) at the Trier Gauge (Pegel Trier).\nHigh water:\n\n11.28 m (37 ft 0 in), Trier Gauge on 21 December 1993\n10.56 m (34 ft 8 in), Trier Gauge on 28 May 1983\n10.33 m (33 ft 11 in), Trier Gauge on 23 January 1995\n10.26 m (33 ft 8 in), Trier Gauge on 12 April 1983\n9.92 m (32 ft 7 in), Trier Gauge on 27 February 1997Low water:\n\n0.47 m (1 ft 7 in) in Bernkastel on 28 July 1921\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Moselle was known to the Romans by the name of Flumen Musalla (in the Tabula Peutingeriana), and the river was romanticised by the poet Ausonius around 371. From 1815, the Moselle formed the border between the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and Prussia (German Empire in 1871).\nIn the act of 10 April 1952 ratifying the treaty instituted by the ECSC, Article 2 charged the French Government \"to initiate, before the establishment of the Common Market, negotiations with the governments concerned in order to achieve a rapid implementation of the canalisation of the Moselle between Thionville and Koblenz.The River was canalised between Metz and Thionville, via a canal opened in 1964 by the Grand Duchess, Charlotte of Luxembourg, the Federal Chancellor of Germany, Konrad Adenauer and their host, Charles de Gaulle, President of France.It is on the Moselle, at the site of the France\u2013Germany\u2013Luxembourg tripoint, that the Schengen Agreement was signed in 1992, establishing the free movement of goods and people in the European Community.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Moselle valley between Metz and Thionville is an industrial area, with coal mining and steel manufacturers.\nThe Moselle valley is famous for its scenery and wine. Most well-known is the German Mosel wine region, while the Luxembourg winegrowing region is called Moselle Luxembourgeoise and the French region is called AOC Moselle. Most notable among the wines produced here are Riesling, Elbling, M\u00fcller-Thurgau, Kerner, and Auxerrois. The German part of the Moselle is a tourist destination.\n\n\n=== Navigation ===\nAfter the Second World War, France pressed to be able to ply the Moselle with larger ships in order to be able to link the industrial regions of Lorraine. When, in 1955, the population on the Saar voted to belong to West Germany, France demanded as \"compensation\" an upgrade of the Moselle. On 27 October 1956 they concluded the Moselle Treaty with Germany and Luxembourg for a canalisation of the Moselle and conceded to Germany in return the extension of the Grand Canal d'Alsace on the Upper Rhine instead of an extension of the canal via Breisach. In 1958 work began and by 26 May 1964 the Moselle could be officially opened from Metz to Koblenz as a major waterway for shipping with 14 locks. France extended it by 1979 as far as Neuves-Maisons. With that, 394 km (245 mi) of the Moselle have been upgraded with a total of 28 locks. In the years 1992 to 1999 the navigable channel was deepened from 2.7 m (8 ft 10 in) to 3.0 m (9 ft 10 in), which enables 1,500-tonne freighters to use the river, a 20% increase in capacity. The channel has a width of 40 m (130 ft), more on the bends. The International Moselle Commission (IMK), founded in 1962 with its head office in Trier, is responsible for navigation. The Moselle Shipping Police Act which it has produced is valid in all three participant states from Metz to Koblenz.\nIn 1921 the Moselle (Mo) became a Reich waterway, today it is a federal waterway (Bundeswasserstra\u00dfe) from Apach at the tripoint to its mouth on the Rhine at kilometre point 592.29 in Koblenz. The waterway is 242 km (150 mi) long and managed by the Trier and Koblenz Water and Shipping Offices (Wasser- und Schifffahrts\u00e4mtern Trier und Koblenz). It is categorized as a European waterway of Class Vb. Its kilometrage begins at its mouth at kilometre point 0 and runs upstream. Since 1816 it has formed a 36 km (22 mi) long condominium from Apach, a common Germany\u2013Luxembourg sovereign area with a division of responsibilities set out in a 1976 agreement. The International Moselle Company, initially set up in 1957 to finance the construction of the river's upgrade, manages the shipping charges and the operation and maintenance of the waterway which they are used to fund.\n\nToday the Moselle is navigable for large cargo ships up to 110 metres (360 ft) long from the Rhine in Koblenz up to Neuves-Maisons, south of Nancy. For smaller ships it is connected to other parts of France through the Canal de l'Est and the Canal de la Marne au Rhin. There are locks in Koblenz, Lehmen, M\u00fcden, Fankel, Sankt Aldegund, Enkirch, Zeltingen, Wintrich, Detzem, Trier, Grevenmacher, Palzem, Apach, K\u0153nigsmacker, Thionville, Richemont, Talange, Metz, Ars-sur-Moselle, Pagny-sur-Moselle, Bl\u00e9nod-l\u00e8s-Pont-\u00e0-Mousson, Custines, Pompey, Aingeray, Fontenoy-sur-Moselle, Toul, Villey-le-Sec, and Neuves-Maisons.By 1970 more than 10 million tonnes of goods were being transported on the Moselle, the majority on towed barges. Upstream freight mainly comprised fuel and ores; downstream the main goods were steel products, gravel and rocks. There is an inland port at Trier, a transshipment site in Zell (Mosel); and there are other ports in Mertert, Thionville, Metz and Frouard. In addition to freighters there are also pleasure boats for tourists between the very busy wine villages and small towns of the Middle and Lower Moselle.\nThere are also yachting or sports marinas in the following places: Koblenz, Winningen, Brodenbach, Burgen, L\u00f6f, Hatzenport, Senheim, Treis, Traben-Trarbach, Kues, Neumagen, P\u00f6lich, Schweich, Trier and Konz. The Moselle is linked near Toul via the Canal de la Marne au Rhin with inter alia the Meuse, the Sa\u00f4ne and the Rh\u00f4ne. Other canals link the river to the North Sea and even the Mediterranean.\n\n\n=== Locks and dams (weirs) ===\n\nThere is a total of 28 changes of level on the Moselle:\n\n16 in France near Neuves-Maisons, Villey-le-Sec, Toul, Fontenoy-sur-Moselle, Aingeray, Frouard-Pompey, Custines, Bl\u00e9nod-l\u00e8s-Pont-\u00e0-Mousson, Pagny-sur-Moselle, Ars-sur-Moselle, Metz, Talange, Richemont, Thionville, K\u0153nigsmacker and Apach\n2 between Luxembourg and Germany near Stadtbredimus-Palzem and Grevenmacher-Wellen\n10 in Germany near Trier, Detzem, Wintrich, Zeltingen, Enkirch, St. Aldegund, Fankel, M\u00fcden, Lehmen and Koblenz. Detzem is the highest lock \u2013 9 m (30 ft) \u2013 and at 29 km (18 mi) the upstream reach is the longest on the river; it is the only lock to be built on a canal of some length excavated outside the river bed.With the exception of Detzem, all the structures at each change in level are laid out side by side; the lock is by one riverbank, the weir in the middle and the hydropower plant on the other bank. Between the lock and weir are a boat slipway and channel and boat lock, while between the weir and the power station is the fish ladder. The structures have been blended into the landscape through their low-level design; this was achieved by the choice of sector gates for the weir, vertically lowering upper gates and mitred lower lock gates. The water levels and hydropower works are controlled by the Fankel Central Control Station (Zentralwarte Fankel) of the RWE Power Company at Fankel.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nThrough the Moselle valley run the Moselle Wine Route and the Moselle Cycleway, which may be cycled from Metz in France via Trier to  Koblenz on the River Rhine, a distance of 311 km (193 mi). Between Koblenz and Trier, large sections run on the trackbed of the old Moselle Valley Railway, far from the noise and fumes of motor vehicles. Every year on the Sunday after Pentecost, the 140 km (87 mi) of road between Schweich and Cochem is also car-free as part of Happy Moselle Day.\nA number of notable castles and ruins adorn the heights above the Moselle valley and many are visible on a boat trip on the Moselle.\nIn 1910, a hiking trail, the Moselle Ridgeway, was established which runs for 185 km (115 mi) on the Eifel side and 262 km (163 mi) on the Hunsr\u00fcck side. Another unusual trail runs from Ediger-Eller via the Calmont Trail to Bremm through the steepest vineyard in Europe.\nBefore the construction of barrages the Moselle was a popular route for folding kayaks which is why many of the weirs have boat channels. The river is still used today by canoeists, especially during the annual week-long lock closures when no commercial shipping is permitted.\nIn April 2014 the Moselle Trail was opened, a path running for 365 km (227 mi) from Perl on the Upper Moselle to Koblenz. Numerous Moselle Trail \"partner trails\", the so-called side branches (Seitenspr\u00fcnge) and \"dream paths\" (Traumpfade) enhance the hiking network in the Moselle Valley.The ADAC's Rallye Deutschland has taken place since 2000 in the vineyards along the Moselle at Veldenz, Dhron, Piesport, Minheim, Kesten, Trittenheim, Fell, Ruwertal and Trier.\nAt Koblenz Locks the Mosellum offers exhibitions about the migration of fish in the Moselle as well as water ecology, navigation and power generation. With the construction of the visitor and information centre the most modern fish ladder along the Moselle was opened.\n\n\n=== Wine ===\nThe Moselle winegrowing region lies along the Moselle with a cultivated area of about 10,540 ha (26,000 acres). The largest part, currently just under 9,000 ha (22,000 acres), is on German soil in the states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland; the Luxembourg part has an area of about 1,300 ha (3,200 acres) (see Wine in Luxembourg). Upstream on the Moselle the vineyards extend into France as far as Seille in the region of C\u00f4tes de Moselle with an area of 130 ha (320 acres) and to the region around Toul (C\u00f4tes de Toul) covering 110 ha (270 acres).\nThe German Moselle wine region, including its tributaries, bears the growing and manufacturing name of \"Mosel\". For marketing reasons the agricultural authorities of the region have divided it into six winegrowing areas. The wine literature and specialist press, by contrast, divide the region into four areas based on geomorphological, micro-climatic and also historical reasons:\n\nUpper Moselle\nThe valley sides of the Upper Moselle (also called the Burgundy Moselle, Burgundermosel) with their overwhelmingly muschelkalk soils belong geologically to the so-called Paris Basin, which explains its low proportion of Riesling \u2013 only around 10% in 2010 \u2013 and the increasing cultivation of Pinot Blanc and Pinot Noir grapes.Trier Region\nAround the city of Trier and in the valleys of the Saar and Ruwer with their side valleys, the Riesling is the predominant grape on the shale soils, with over 80% of the crop. One climatic feature of this area is the frequent orientation of often small southwest-southeast facing locations in which the vegetation is exposed to stronger, cooler winds and, especially in the light of recent global warming, often achieve lower degrees of maturity than in the narrow, often deeply incised valley of the Middle and Lower Moselle.Middle Moselle\nWith around 6,000 ha (15,000 acres) of vineyard the Middle Moselle is the largest winegrowing area of the Moselle. According to the wine experts and trade, the \"greatest\" wines of the Moselle, both in quantity and quality, are grown here on land that has been consolidated into large concerns with much vaunted steeply sloped vineyards.Lower Moselle\nIn the Lower Moselle Valley, there are a number of medieval castles, high above little villages, decorated with timber-framed houses, surrounded by steep slopes with small terraces in the narrow, winding valley. Here, cultivating vines is very labour-intensive and costly and it is difficult to make it economical. As a result, it is common for vineyards to fall into ruin here.The wine industry on the German Moselle has been declining for decades. In 2005, statistics showed there were 10,375 ha (25,640 acres) of vineyard; by 2012 this had fallen to just 8,491 ha (20,980 acres). The vineyards that have fallen fallow are mostly those on extremely steep hillsides. There has been a major decline in the number of so-called Nebenerwerbswinzer (vintners for whom it is a secondary occupation), and the small, family farming operations that, until the end of the 1960s formed the majority of wine businesses. Comparative figures by the Chamber of Agriculture for Rhineland-Palatinate for several wine villages on the Lower Moselle show that there were still 797 wine businesses in the early 1960s, but by the early 2000s there were only just under 100.\nThere has been the opposite trend amongst the established traditional wine estates and more recent vintners with a sound education in oenology and business management, who have increased their business through the reclamation of once renowned, but long forgotten sites. The end of the  20th century saw the rediscovery of the use of special terroir in order to improve quality and value, which has led to a more nuanced view of Moselle wine that, a few years before, had been characterised by overproduction, label scandals and cheap offers.\n\n\n=== Moselle umbrella brand ===\nOn 10 November 2006 in Burg, the Moselle Regional Initiative was founded. The introduction of the Moselle as an umbrella brand was based on that of the Eifel region and covers products and services from the areas of agriculture, forestry, tourism, handicrafts and nature.\n\n\n=== Moselle slate ===\nMoselle slate (Moselschiefer) is a manufacturing and trade description for slate from the municipalities of Mayen, Polch, M\u00fcllenbach, Trier and its surrounding area. Today only products from the roofing slate mines of Katzenberg in Mayen and Margareta in Polch bear the name Moselle Slate. The name is derived from the historical transport route for this slate along the Moselle to the Lower Rhine.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nThe Moselle was celebrated in Mosella, a Latin poem by Ausonius (4th century). In the 20th century, the river and the folklore and local history of the towns along its banks were described by British travel writer Roger Pilkington. In the tale, \"The Seven Swabians\" of the Brothers Grimm, the eponymous Swabians drown trying to cross the Moselle.\n\n\n== Castles ==\n\nCh\u00e2teau de Meinsberg (dit de Malbrouck): near Manderen, this castle was built in the 15th century but rebuilt in the 1990s. Today it is used for numerous cultural events.\nCh\u00e2teau Fort de Sierck-les-Bains: situated just on the French-German border at Sierck-les-Bains, this fortress of the Duke of Lorraine dates back to the 11th century. Most of today's castle was constructed in the 18th century, following plans from Vauban.\nSchloss Berg: a Renaissance castle at Nennig, today a hotel and a casino.\nAlte Burg: a manor house built in 1360 at Longuich. One of the few surviving manor houses in rural Rhineland-Palatinate.\nSchloss Lieser: a palace at Lieser built from 1884 to 1887 in historistic style.\nLandshut Castle: a castle built by the Electorate of Trier in the 13th century at Bernkastel-Kues.\nGrevenburg: ruins of a castle at Traben-Trarbach built by Johann III of Sponheim-Starkenburg about 1350, destroyed, after many sieges, in 1734.\nMarienburg: a 12th-century castle and later monastery near P\u00fcnderich and Alf.\nArras Castle: a 12th-century castle in Alf.\nMetternich Castle: a castle built around 1120 at Beilstein, today partly in ruins.\nCochem Castle: The castle in Cochem was originally built in the 11th century, but was completely destroyed by French soldiers in 1689. The present castle was rebuilt later in the 19th century.\nThurant Castle: Above the town of Alken is Thurant Castle, built in the 13th century. It is the only twin-towered castle along the Moselle. The fortress was built by the Count Palatine Henry of the house of Guelph between 1198 and 1206. From 1246 to 1248, it was the two archbishops of Cologne and Trier. Following conquest, it was divided by a partition wall into two halves, each with a keep (tower). During the 19th century, Thurant disintegrated, becoming a ruin; and in 1911 was acquired by Privy Councilor, Dr. Robert Allmers, who had it rebuilt. Since 1973, the castle has been owned by the Allmers and Wulf families.\nEhrenburg: a 12th-century castle built by the Electorate of Trier at Brodenbach.\nEltz Castle: The von Eltz family castle, whose history dates back to the 12th century. It remains in private hands to this day but it is open to visitors.\nLower and Upper Castle, Kobern-Gondorf: two 11th-century castles, today mostly in ruins.\nPyrmont Castle: This 13th-century castle near Roes was remodelled and extended several times during the Baroque era.\nBischofstein Castle: Across the river from the municipality of Burgen is this 13th-century castle, which was destroyed during the Nine Years' War, but was reconstructed and now serves as a retreat centre for the Fichte Gymnasium in Krefeld.See also: Wikimedia Commons \u2013 Castles in Rhineland-Palatinate\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDecimius Magnus Ausonius: Mosella [Description of a journey by ship on the Moselle around 371 A.

          "Peaceful and absolutely beautiful, the canal de la Moselle avec son \u00eelot, nice to stroll in the lovely city of Metz, on the edge of the canal, now this spring, without tourists or couples, in this enclosed time, the canal really enjoys being the center of peace and daydreams.",
          "We went there in mid of December. So even though it is quite cold, however it is a very nice walk to go strolling in the bank of canals with family.",
          "Its the river running through Metz and gives the town a better image. Great walks and running at the banks of the river. Nice parks.",
          "Metz is really a beautiful city to visit, and the Canal crossing inside the city is so beautiful and relaxing. To walk all along it is a true pleasure as we feel to walk in countryside. Metz is green city !",
          "I'm a big fan of the Western European river system, so I was looking forward to seeing the Moselle . . . which here seemed more like an extensive, stagnant puddle. Maybe it was the time of year; I don't know. But though I liked the view, the photos had led me to believe",
          "This is a beautiful easy stroll along the Moselle river. Great place to take photos and experience the beauty of this small french town.",
          "Loved the trump art floating in the river, priceless! Loved all the bridges and the walkways near the water.",
          "We walked along this area a few times whilst exploring the city. It is very pretty and well cared for with lovely flower boxes and borders. We didn't see any litter in the bits we visited although there was some grafitti. The canal is very slow moving so the reflections were",
          "If you are in Metz you really can't miss this. It's everywhere. All picturesque even on an overcast/drizzly day in November when we were here. I imagine this is quite beautiful in the summertime.",
          "For a lovely walk through Metz, follow the canal. It is a nice walk for both day and night and the canal is lit up in the evening, which makes it all the better.",
          "We walked along the canal in the late afternoon/early evening and it was quite lovely. We had beautiful views of the town.",
          "Just one block from the cathedral. Several bridges link the old section of town to the Place de la Com\u00e9die. Nice to spend some time under the trees on a hot day.",
          "Nice walk was it. Indeed peaceful,thankful sunny weather,some restaurant there. Good location,nice city view.",
          "Just two blocks down the street from the famous cathedral you should not miss it. The view is great and romantic.",
          "If you come and see the old town and cathedrale you might not walk down the short blocks to the river, and it would be a shame. The buildings are especially pretty at night, in winter they can go monochromatic during the day.",
          "We enjoyed seeing the Moselle in Metz. There are several places to cross; it was nice to spend a few minutes on two of the bridges. Nice views.",
          "This is a beautiful place to walk and see the swans and people out and about. There are beautiful apartments and gardens along the way, and I saw kayakers and other boaters.",
          "There are bike paths along the canal that are wonderful for a sunset ride. Quiet, serene, and not too much traffic.",
          "take your time , and walk for one hour, around this spot , you will not regret it , the small boats passing by ....and the ducks",
          "You probably won't come and stare at this canal for hours on end, but the worthy city of Metz has provided you with things to do when you've had enough of looking at the water: the cathedral, the Temple Neuf, pleasant waterside caf\u00e9s and restaurants, the opera theatre, historic",
          "Lovely visit to Mertz, what a picturesque town. Public parking garages are plentiful and allow you to enjoy the town by foot.",
          "Beautiful walking paths along the canal. Nice way to spend a little time away from the crowds and watch the ducks and swans. Lots of joggers enjoy it too.",
          "The canal is really nice for a small promenade along the river on a summer day. It goes from the beautiful park to the small idyllic city of Metz.",
          "Pleasant walk around area; even in the rain but have an umbrella! Many swans and ducks. Not many places to sit but a great leisurely walk after a super lunch and glass of wine.",
          "Away from the maddening crowd moment, not that there are big crowds in Metz. Chance to wander, enjoy quite time in a really nice architectural setting. Worth doing a circular walk around the town taking in the riverside, get to see a bit of everything",
          "Great spot for a walk to take in the scenery along the river and historic area of the city of Metz, a do not miss area of the city.",
          "The canal is really pretty . Great spot for photos and in the heart if the Comedy square . A stone brig over the river frames the backdrop for this lovely backdrop in Metz . Great buildings on either side of the canal too .",
          "Returned to this beautiful town with the family, and enjoyed a pleasing walk down the Mosel river. The area is quite amazing, and during warm weather would be perfect for a picnic/stroll.",
          "The canal is very close to the city centre and provides for a beautiful walk. Nearby there is a link to the river which runs alongside a bridge. It is a slalom canoeing course but when not being used for that is a good place for bird spotting such as Heron, Kingfisher and Yellow",
          "It's a nice walk along riverside streets and paths, and several attractions are near the canal (such as the cathedral and market). While it provided nice ambience on our way, it isn't worth a special trip",
          "The Canal de la Moselle is situated in downtown Metz near the cathedral. Interesting as it is, it's just another canal in a city that does not seem to be interested in promoting itself or its tourist attractions. Only about average. Too bad.",
          "Nice place to visit next to cathedral, you can relaxing along the water/river. it is charming and illuminated at night, romantic. the canal in Metz city has nice views but water is dirty. it is highly recommended.",
          "Close to the cathedral visit the Moselle and the surrounding streets. Quaint and charming. Illuminated at night. Lots of student nightlife on and close to the canal.",
          "Sadly the water in this canal is quite dirty and there is a fair amount of litter floating downstream. That's a shame because we saw majestic swans and many ducks living on the water. We also saw many fish in the canal. I agree with other reviewers the canal affords a unique",
          "Lovely paths to stroll along the river! Very scenic paths and nestled along 13-17th century fortifications!",
          "Nice place to take a relaxing stroll along the water and see the paddle boats and kayakers go by. Different view of the church as well.",
          "Why not rent a boat with your best friends and paddle around for an hour? It is fun and you have a unique view at the protestan church and the cathedrale. Most important of all, don't expect too much, it is only fun if you and your friends are in a good mood if not, all this",
          "We took the boat trip for 45 minutes and were disappointed at the thick vegetation with little to see. We are spoiled by the Rhine River in Germany! The last 15 minutes when the boat entered the water near the Moyen Pont was more interesting with the swans, kayakers, and the",
          "Typical access to a city these days is by road. As you enter by train, the face of the place changes. Even more so if you arrive by boat! In France you can rent a boat without a permit or license. The rates depend on your need of space and comfort. Traveling on the Moselle River",
          "When I asked the lady in the Tourist Office to advise me which bus I need to take to see the \"proper\" Moselle, she assured me this was it. It clearly isn't."

        "wiki": "The Gare de Metz-Ville is the main railway station serving the city of Metz, capital of Lorraine, France. Sometimes spoken of as the Station Palace as it displays the apartments of the German Kaiser Wilhelm II, Metz station has been registered as a Historic Monument since 15 January 1975. This designation gives legal protection to the station's facade, the roof, the departure hall, the honorary lounge, and the former station restaurant with its interior decorations.\n\n\n== History and strategic role ==\nThe station in Metz was a central point of plans for a new urban area in Metz, now called the Imperial Quarter, which was built during the first annexation of Metz into the German Empire. In order to \"Germanify\" the city, Kaiser Wilhelm II decided upon the creation of a new district shaped by a distinctive blend of Germanic architecture. The district was conceived by German architect Conrad Wahn and is now commonly called the Imperial District.\nThe railway station constitutes the cornerstone of this district, not far from the historic downtown. Its first aim was military usage and it had to answer a strategic need: For the success of the Schlieffen plan, the Kaiser had to be able to transport his troops from France to Russia in just 24 hours. This resulted in a sizeable station with platforms large enough to accommodate troops on foot and on horseback. So the Metz railway station was directly linked to Berlin via the Cannons Railway.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe railway station is a 350-metre-long neo-Romanesque building built between 1905 and 1908 by German architect J\u00fcrgen Kr\u00f6ger, assisted by the architects J\u00fcrgensen and Bachmann, as well as by the sculptor Schirmer. It was built in the pale grey stoneware of Niderviller, in marked contrast to the other buildings of the city, which are mainly built in yellow limestone. Because of the swampy soil of the area, the station and its water tower are built on 3,034 foundation piles which run from ten to seventeen metres deep, made from the system of reinforced concrete which had just been developed by the French engineer Fran\u00e7ois Hennebique.\nThe station building is architecturally reminiscent of the shape of a church in the departure hall area, with a clock tower rising 40m in height (said to be designed by Kaiser Wilhelm himself); on the other hand, the arrivals hall and restaurant echo the form of an imperial palace. The purpose of this is to represent the religious and temporal powers of the Holy Roman emperors. The statue of the Knight Roland at the angle of the clock tower represents Imperial protection over Metz. In the great hallway a stained glass window depicts the Emperor Charlemagne sitting on his throne. Kaiser Wilhelm appreciated his travels to Metz and the imperial territory of Alsace-Lorraine, which was administered directly by the imperial government in Berlin. So at the railway station can be seen the apartments he used during his visits to the city; today they have been transformed into offices for the SNCF Railway Company.\nThe forecourt of the railway station is adorned by street furnitures designed by Philippe Starck.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nThe Gare de Metz-Ville is connected to the French TGV high speed train network, which provides a direct rail service to Paris, the city of Luxembourg, Dijon, Lyon, Marseille, and Montpellier. The time from Paris East station to Metz railway station is about 82 minutes. Additionally, Metz railway station is connected to the Lorraine TGV station, located at Louvigny, 25 km (16 mi) at the south of Metz, for high speed trains going to Nantes, Rennes, Brussels, Bordeaux and France international Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport (without stopping in Paris).\nAlso Metz is one of the main stations of the regional express trains system named M\u00e9trolor. One of its main lines is the Nancy-Metz-Luxembourg line, completed by many lines going to main cities of the area.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMetz-Ville station at \"Gares & Connexions\", the official website of SNCF (in French)\nTimetables TER Lorraine (in French)",

        "wiki": "Metz ( METS, French: [m\u025bs] (listen), Lorraine Franconian: [m\u025bts]) Latin: Divodurum Mediomatricorum is a city in northeast France located at the confluence of the Moselle and the Seille rivers. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle department and the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region. Located near the tripoint along the junction of France, Germany, and Luxembourg, the city forms a central place of the European Greater Region and the SaarLorLux euroregion.Metz has a rich 3,000-year-history, having variously been a Celtic oppidum, an important Gallo-Roman city, the Merovingian capital of Austrasia, the birthplace of the Carolingian dynasty, a cradle of the Gregorian chant, and one of the oldest republics in Europe. The city has been steeped in Romance culture, but has been strongly influenced by Germanic culture due to its location and history.Because of its historical, cultural, and architectural background, Metz has been submitted on France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. The city features noteworthy buildings such as the Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral with its largest expanse of stained-glass windows in the world, the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains being the oldest church in France, its Imperial Station Palace displaying the apartment of the German Kaiser, or its Opera House, the oldest one working in France. Metz is home to some world-class venues including the Arsenal Concert Hall and the Centre Pompidou-Metz museum.\nA basin of urban ecology, Metz gained its nickname of The Green City (French: La Ville Verte), as it has extensive open grounds and public gardens. The historic city centre is one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France.A historic garrison town, Metz is the economic heart of the Lorraine region, specialising in information technology and automotive industries. Metz is home to the University of Lorraine, Georgia Tech Lorraine, and a centre for applied research and development in the materials sector, notably in metallurgy and metallography, the heritage of the Lorraine region's past in the iron and steel industry.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn ancient times, the town was known as \"city of Mediomatrici\", being inhabited by the tribe of the same name. After its integration into the Roman Empire, the city was called Divodurum Mediomatricum, meaning Holy Village or Holy Fortress of the Mediomatrici, then it was known as Mediomatrix. During the 5th century AD, the name evolved to \"Mettis\", which gave rise to Metz.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMetz has a recorded history dating back over 2,000 years. Before the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar in 52 BC, it was the oppidum of the Celtic Mediomatrici tribe. Integrated into the Roman Empire, Metz became quickly one of the principal towns of Gaul with a population of 40,000, until the barbarian depredations and its transfer to the Franks about the end of the 5th century. Between the 6th and 8th centuries, the city was the residence of the Merovingian kings of Austrasia. After the Treaty of Verdun in 843, Metz became the capital of the Kingdom of Lotharingia and was ultimately integrated into the Holy Roman Empire, being granted semi-independent status. During the 12th century, Metz became a republic and the Republic of Metz stood until the 15th century.With the signature of the Treaty of Chambord in 1552, Metz passed to the hands of the Kings of France. As the German Protestant Princes who traded Metz (alongside Toul and Verdun) for the promise of French military assistance, had no authority to cede territory of the Holy Roman Empire, the change of jurisdiction wasn't recognised by the Holy Roman Empire until the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. Under French rule, Metz was selected as capital of the Three Bishoprics and became a strategic fortified town. With creation of the departments by the Estates-General of 1789, Metz was chosen as capital of the Department of Moselle. Although French-speaking, after the Franco-Prussian War and according to the Treaty of Frankfurt of 1871, the city was annexed into the German Empire, being part of the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine and serving as capital of the Bezirk Lothringen.Metz remained German until the end of World War I, when it reverted to France. However, after the Battle of France during the Second World War, the city was annexed once more by the German Third Reich. In 1944, the attack on the city by the U.S. Third Army freed the city from German rule and Metz reverted one more time to France after World War II.During the 1950s, Metz was chosen to be the capital of the newly created Lorraine region. With the creation of the European Community and the later European Union, the city has become central to the Greater Region and the SaarLorLux Euroregion.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMetz is located on the banks of the Moselle and the Seille rivers, 43 km (26.7 mi) from the Schengen tripoint where the borders of France, Germany, and Luxembourg meet. The city was built in a place where many branches of the Moselle river creates several islands, which are encompassed within the urban planning.The terrain of Metz forms part of the Paris Basin and presents a plateau relief cut by river valleys presenting cuestas in the north\u2013south direction. Metz and its surrounding countryside are included in the forest and crop Lorraine Regional Natural Park, covering a total area of 205,000 ha (506,566.0 acres).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of Lorraine is a semi-continental climate. The summers are warm and humid, sometimes stormy, and the warmest month of the year is July, when daytime temperatures average approximately 25 \u00b0C (77.0 \u00b0F). The winters are cold and snowy with temperature dropping to an average low of \u22120.5 \u00b0C (31.1 \u00b0F) in January. Lows can be much colder through the night and early morning and the snowy period extends from November to February.The length of the day varies significantly over the course of the year. The shortest day is 21 December with 7:30 hours of sunlight; the longest day is 20 June with 16:30 hours of sunlight. The median cloud cover is 93% and does not vary substantially over the course of the year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nThe inhabitants of Metz are called Messin(e)s. Statistics on the ethnic and religious make up of the population of Metz are haphazard, as the French Republic prohibits making distinctions between citizens regarding race, beliefs, and political and philosophic opinions in the process of census taking. This would otherwise document the city to be a Germanic locale, as is the rest of the province and the neighboring Alsace.The French national census of 2012 estimated the population of Metz to be 119,551, while the population of Metz urban agglomeration was about 389,851. Through history, Metz's population has been impacted by the vicissitudes of the wars and annexations involving the city, which have prevented continuous population growth. More recently, the city has suffered from the restructuring of the military and the metallurgy industry. The historical population for the current area of Metz municipality is as follows:\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\nSeveral well-known figures have been linked to the city of Metz throughout its history. Renowned Messins include poet Paul Verlaine, composer Ambroise Thomas, and mathematician Jean-Victor Poncelet; numerous well-known German figures were also born in Metz notably during the annexation periods. Moreover, the city has been the residence of people such as writer Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Cardinal Mazarin, political thinker Alexis de Tocqueville, French patriot and American Revolutionary War hero Marquis Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette, and Luxembourg-born German-French statesman Robert Schuman.\n\n\n== Law and government ==\n\n\n=== Local law ===\n\nThe Local Law (French: droit local) applied in Metz is a legal system that operates in parallel with French law. Created in 1919, it preserves the French laws applied in France before 1870 and maintained by the Germans during the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, but repealed in the rest of France after 1871. It also maintains German laws enacted by the German Empire between 1871 and 1918, specific provisions adopted by the local authorities, and French laws that have been enacted after 1919 to be applicable only in Alsace-Lorraine. This specific local legislation encompasses different areas including religion, social work and finance.\nThe most striking of the legal differences between France and Alsace-Lorraine is the absence in Alsace-Lorraine of strict secularism, even though a constitutional right of freedom of religion is guaranteed by the French government. Alsace-Lorraine is still governed by a pre-1905 law established by the Concordat of 1801, which provides for the public subsidy of the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches and the Jewish religion.\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\nLike every commune of the present French Republic, Metz is managed by a mayor (French: maire) and a municipal council (French: conseil municipal), democratically elected by two-round proportional voting for six years. The mayor is assisted by 54 municipal councillors, and the municipal council is held on the last Thursday of every month. Since 2008, the mayor of Metz has been socialist Dominique Gros.The city belongs to the Metz Metropole union of cities, which includes the 40 cities of the Metz urban agglomeration. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle based in the former Intendant Palace. In addition, Metz is the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region, hosted in the former Saint-Clement Abbey.\n\n\n=== City administrative divisions ===\n\nThe city of Metz is divided into 14 administrative divisions:\n\n\n== Cityscape and environmental policy ==\n\nMetz contains a mishmash of architectural layers, bearing witness to centuries of history at the crossroads of different cultures, and features a number of architectural landmarks. The city possesses one of the largest Urban Conservation Areas in France, and more than 100 of the city's buildings are classified on the Monument Historique list. Because of its historical and cultural background, Metz is designated as French Town of Art and History, and has been submitted on to France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List.The city is famous for its yellow limestone architecture, a result of the extensive use of Jaumont stone. The historic district has kept part of the Gallo-Roman city with Divodurum's Cardo Maximus, then called Via Scarponensis (today the Trinitaires, Taison, and Serpenoise streets), and the Decumanus Maximus (today En Fournirue and d'Estr\u00e9es streets). At the Cardo and Decumanus intersection was situated the Roman forum, today the Saint-Jacques Square.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nFrom its Gallo-Roman past, the city preserves vestiges of the thermae (in the basement of the Golden Courtyard museum), parts of the aqueduct, and the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains.Saint Louis' square with its vaulted arcades and a Knights Templar chapel remains a major symbol of the city's High Medieval heritage. The Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral, several churches and H\u00f4tels, and two remarkable municipal granaries reflect the Late Middle Ages. Examples of Renaissance architecture can be seen in H\u00f4tels from the 16th century, such as the House of Heads (French: Maison des T\u00eates).The city hall and the buildings surrounding the town square are by French architect Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Blondel, who was awarded the task of redesigning and modernizing the centre of Metz by the Royal Academy of Architecture in 1755 the context of the Enlightenment. Neoclassical buildings from the 18th century, such as the Opera House, the Intendant Palace (the present-day prefecture), and the Royal Governor's Palace (the present-day courthouse) built by Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau, are also found in the city.The Imperial District was built during the first annexation of Metz by the German Empire. In order to \"germanise\" the city, Emperor Wilhelm II decided to create a new district shaped by a distinctive blend of Germanic architecture, including Renaissance, neo-Romanesque and neo-Classical, mixed with elements of Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Alsatian and mock-Bavarian styles. Instead of Jaumont stone, commonly used everywhere else in the city, stone used in the Rhineland, such as pink and grey sandstone, granite and basalt were used. The district features noteworthy buildings including the rail station and the Central Post Office by German architect J\u00fcrgen Kr\u00f6ger.Modern architecture can also be seen in the town with works of French architects Roger-Henri Expert (Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-de-l'Enfant-J\u00e9sus church, 1934), Georges-Henri Pingusson (Fire Station, 1960), and Jean Dubuisson (subdivisions, 1960s). The refurbishment of the former Ney Arsenal as a Concert Hall in 1989 and the erection of the Metz Arena in 2002, by Spanish and French architects Ricardo Bofill and French Paul Chemetov represent the Postmodern movement.The Centre Pompidou-Metz museum in the Amphitheatre District represents a strong architectural initiative to mark the entrance of Metz into the 21st century. Designed by Japanese architect Shigeru Ban, the building is remarkable for the complex, innovative carpentry of its roof, and integrates concepts of sustainable architecture. The project encompasses the architecture of two recipients of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, Shigeru Ban (2014) and French Christian de Portzamparc (1994). The Amphitheatre District is also conceived by French architects Nicolas Michelin, Jean-Paul Viguier, and Jean-Michel Wilmotte and designer Philippe Starck. The urban project is expected to be completed by 2023. Further, a contemporary music venue designed by contextualist French architect Rudy Ricciotti stands in the Borny District.\n\n\n=== Urban ecology ===\n\nUnder the leadership of such people as botanist Jean-Marie Pelt, Metz pioneered a policy of urban ecology during the early 1970s. Because of the failure of post-war urban planning and housing estate development in Europe during the 1960s, mostly based on the concepts of CIAM, Jean-Marie Pelt, then municipal councillor of Metz, initiated a new approach to the urban environment.Based initially on the ideas of the Chicago School, Pelt's theories pleaded for better integration of humans into their environment and developed a concept centered on the relationship between \"stone and water\". His policy was realized in Metz by the establishment of extensive open areas surrounding the Moselle and the Seille rivers and the development of large pedestrian areas. As a result, Metz has over 37 m2 (400 sq ft) of open areas per inhabitant in the form of numerous public gardens in the city.The principles of urban ecology are still applied in Metz with the implementation of a local Agenda 21 action plan. The municipal ecological policy encompasses the sustainable refurbishment of ancient buildings, the erection of sustainable districts and buildings, green public transport, and the creation of public gardens by means of landscape architecture.Additionally, the city has developed its own combined heat and power station, using waste wood biomass from the surrounding forests as a renewable energy source. With a thermal efficiency above 80%, the 45MW boiler of the plant provides electricity and heat for 44,000 dwellings. The Metz power station is the first local producer and distributor of energy in France.\n\n\n=== Military architecture ===\n\nAs a historic Garrison town, Metz has been heavily influenced by military architecture throughout its history. From ancient history to the present, the city has been successively fortified and modified to accommodate the troops stationed there. Defensive walls from classical antiquity to the 20th century are still visible today, incorporated into the design of public gardens along the Moselle and Seille rivers. A medieval bridge castle from the 13th century, named Germans' Gate (French: Porte des Allemands), today converted into a convention and exhibition centre, has become one of the landmarks of the city. It is still possible to see parts of the 16th century citadel, as well as fortifications built in the 1740s by Louis de Cormontaigne but based on designs by Vauban. Important barracks, mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries, are spread around the city: some, which are of architectural interest, have been converted to civilian use, such as the Arsenal Concert Hall by Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill.\nThe extensive fortifications of Metz, which ring the city, include early examples of S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res system forts. Other forts were incorporated into the Maginot Line. A hiking trail on the Saint-Quentin plateau passes through a former military training zone and ends at the now abandoned military forts, providing a vantage point from which to survey the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAlthough the steel industry has historically dominated Moselle's economy, Metz's efforts at economic diversification have created a base in the sectors of commerce, tourism, information technology and the automotive industry. The city is the economic heart of the Lorraine region and around 73,000 people work daily within the urban agglomeration. The transport facilities found in the conurbation, including the international high-speed railway, motorway, inland connections and the local bus rapid transit system, have made the city a transport hub in the heart of the European Union. Metz is home to the biggest harbour handling cereals in France with over 4,000,000 tons/year.Metz is home to the Moselle Chamber of Commerce. International companies such as PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, ArcelorMittal, SFR, and TDF have established plants and centres in the Metz conurbation. Metz is also the regional headquarters of the Caisse d'Epargne and Banque Populaire banking groups.\nMetz is an important commercial centre of northern France with France's biggest retailer federation, consisting of around 2,000 retailers. Important retail companies are found in the city, such as the Galeries Lafayette, the Printemps department store and the Fnac entertainment retail chain. The historic city centre displays one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France and a mall, the Saint-Jacques centre. In addition there are several multiplex movie theatres and malls found in the urban agglomeration.\nIn recent years, Metz municipality have promoted an ambitious policy of tourism development, including urban revitalization and refurbishment of buildings and public squares. This policy has been spurred by the creation of the Centre Pompidou-Metz in 2010. Since its inauguration, the institution has become the most popular cultural venue in France outside Paris, with 550,000 visitors per year. Meanwhile, Saint-Stephen Cathedral is the most visited building in the city, accommodating 652,000 visitors per year.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums and exhibition halls ===\n\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz is a museum of modern and contemporary arts, the largest temporary exhibition area in France outside Paris. The museum features exhibitions from the extensive collection of the Centre Pompidou, Europe's largest collection of 20th-century art.\nSaint Stephen's Cathedral is the Gothic cathedral of the city built during the 13th century. The cathedral exhibits the collection of the Bishopric of Metz, including paraments and items used in the service of the Eucharist. Metz Cathedral is sometimes nicknamed the Good Lord's Lantern (French: la Lanterne du Bon Dieu), as it has the largest expanse of stained glass windows in the world: 6,500 m2 (70,000 sq ft). These include works by Gothic and Renaissance master glass makers Hermann von M\u00fcnster, Th\u00e9obald of Lixheim, and Valentin Bousch, romantic Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, tachist Roger Bissi\u00e8re, cubist Jacques Villon and modernist Marc Chagall.\nAnother of the city's churches displays a complete set of stained glass windows by French modernist Jean Cocteau.In addition, Metz features other museums and exhibition venues, such as:\n\nThe FRAC Lorraine, a public collection of contemporary art of the Lorraine region. It is located in the 12th-century Saint-Liver H\u00f4tel and organizes exhibitions of local and international contemporary artists.\nThe Golden Courtyard (French: la Cour d'Or), a museum dedicated to the history of Metz, divided into four sections (e.g. archeology, medieval, architecture, and fine arts). The Golden Courtyard displays a rich collection of Gallo-Roman and medieval finds and the remains of the Gallo-Roman baths of Divodurum Mediomatricum, revealed by the extension works to the museums in the 1930s.\nThe Museum of the 1870 War and of the Annexion in Gravelotte, a village located within the Metz-Metropole conurbation and the site of the Battle of Gravelotte, the only museum in Europe dedicated to the Franco-Prussian War. The museum exhibits military and everyday items from the period as well as artworks related to the 1870 war. A mausoleum erected in 1904 honoring the soldiers who died during the battle, the Memorial Hall (French: La Halle du Souvenir), has been included in the museum.\nThe House for Europe, located on the estate of Robert Schuman in Scy-Chazelles in the Metz-Metropole conurbation, transformed into a museum and convention centre. Across the street is the fortified 12th Century church where Robert Schuman now rests. The Robert Schuman House for Europe organises cultural and educational events that introduce the visitor to Schuman's life and works and to the way Europe has been constructed and continues to develop today.\nVerlaine's House (French: la Maison de Verlaine) is a museum located in the house where the poet Paul Verlaine was born, dedicated to his work, featuring permanent and temporary exhibitions. The Solange Bertrand foundation, located in the artist's former house, conserves and displays her artworks. The municipal archives preserve and exhibit Metz's historical municipal records dating from medieval times to the present.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\nMetz has several venues for the performing arts. The Opera House of Metz, the oldest working opera house in France, features plays, dance, and lyric poetry. The Arsenal Concert Hall, dedicated to art music, is widely renowned for its excellent acoustics. The Trinitarians Club is a multi-media arts complex housed in the vaulted cellar and chapel of an ancient convent, the city's prime venue for jazz music. The Music Box (French: Boite \u00e0 Musique), familiarly known as BAM, is the concert venue dedicated to rock and electronic music. The Braun Hall and the Kolt\u00e8s Theater feature plays, and the city has two movie theaters specializing in Auteur cinema. The Saint-Jacques Square, surrounded by busy bars and pubs whose open-air tables fill the centre of the square.\nSince 2014, the former bus garage has been converted to accommodate over thirty artists in residence, in a space where they can create and rehearse artworks and even build set decorations. The artistic complex, called Metz Network of All Cultures (French: Toutes les Cultures en R\u00e9seau \u00e0 Metz) and familiarly known as TCRM-Blida, encompasses a large hall of 3,000 m2 (32,000 sq ft) while theater and dance companies benefit from a studio of 800 m2 (8,600 sq ft) with backstages.\n\n\n=== Metz in the arts ===\nMetz was an important cultural centre during the Carolingian Renaissance. For instance, Gregorian chant was created in Metz during the 8th century as a fusion of Gallican and ancient Roman repertory. Then called Messin Chant, it remains the oldest form of music still in use in Western Europe. The bishops of Metz, notably Saint-Chrodegang promoted its use for the Roman liturgy in Gallic lands under the favorable influence of the Carolingian monarchs. Messin chant made two major contributions to the body of chant: it fitted the chant into the ancient Greek octoechos system, and invented an innovative musical notation, using neumes to show the shape of a remembered melody. Metz was also an important centre of illumination of Carolingian manuscripts, producing such monuments of Carolingian book illumination as the Drogo Sacramentary.The Metz School (French: \u00c9cole de Metz) was an art movement in Metz and the region between 1834 and 1870, centred on Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal. The term was originally proposed in 1845 by the poet Charles Baudelaire, who appreciated the works of the artists. They were influenced by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix and inspired by the medieval heritage of Metz and its romantic surroundings. The Franco-Prussian War and the annexation of the territory by the Germans resulted in the dismantling of the movement. The main figures of the Metz School were Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, Auguste Migette, Auguste Hussenot, Louis-Th\u00e9odore Devilly, Christopher Fratin, and Charles P\u00eatre. Their works include paintings, engravings, drawings, stained-glass windows, and sculptures.\nA festival named \"passages\" takes place in May. Numerous shows are presented to it.\n\n\n=== The Graoully dragon as symbol of the city ===\n\nThe Graoully is depicted as a fearsome dragon, vanquished by the sacred powers of Saint Clement of Metz, the first Bishop of the city. The Graoully quickly became a symbol of Metz and can be seen in numerous insignia of the city, from the 10th century on. Writers from Metz tend to present the legend as an allegory of Christianity's victory over paganism, represented by the harmful dragon.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nLocal specialties include the quiche, the pot\u00e9e, the Lorrain p\u00e2t\u00e9, and also suckling pig. Different recipes, such as jam, tart, charcuterie and fruit brandy, are made from the Mirabelle and Damson plums. Also, Metz is the cradle of some pastries like the Metz cheese pie and the Metz Balls (French: boulet de Metz), a ganache-stuffed biscuit coated with marzipan, caramel, and dark chocolate. Local beverages include Moselle wine and Amos beer.The Covered Market of Metz is one of the oldest, most grandiose in France and is home to traditional local food producers and retailers. Originally built as the bishop's palace, the French Revolution broke out before the Bishop of Metz could move in and the citizens decided to turn it into a food market. The adjacent Chamber's Square (French: Place de la Chambre) is surrounded by numerous local food restaurants.\n\n\n=== Celebrations and events ===\nMany events are celebrated in Metz throughout the year. The city of Metz dedicates two weeks to the Mirabelle plum during the popular Mirabelle Festival held in August. During the festival, in addition to open markets selling fresh plums, mirabelle tarts, and mirabelle liquor, there are live music, fireworks, parties, art exhibits, a parade with floral floats, a competition, the crowning of the Mirabelle Queen and a gala of celebration.A literature festival is held in June. The Montgolfiades hot air balloon festival is organized in September. The second most popular Christmas Market in France is held in November and December. Finally, a Saint Nicholas parade honors the patron saint of the Lorraine region in December.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nMetz is home to the Football Club of Metz (FC Metz), a football association club in Ligue 1, the highest division of French football (as of 2019\u20132020 season). FC Metz has won three times the Ligue 2 (1935, 2007, and 2014), twice the Coupe de France (in 1984 and 1988) and the French League Cup (in 1986 and 1996), and was French championship runner-up in 1998. FC Metz has also gained recognition in France and Europe for its successful youth academy, winning the Gambardella Cup 3 times in 1981, 2001, and 2010. The Saint-Symphorien stadium has been the home of FC Metz since the creation of the club.\nMetz Handball is a Handball club. Metz Handball has won the French Women's First League championship 23 times, the Women's France Cup nine times, and the French Women's League Cup eight times. The Metz Arena has been the home of Metz Handball since 2002.\nSince 2003, Metz has been home to the Moselle Open, an ATP World Tour 250 tournament played on indoor hard courts, which usually takes place in September.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== High schools ===\nMetz has numerous high schools, including the Fabert High School and the Lyc\u00e9e of Communication. Some of these institutions offer higher education programs such as classes pr\u00e9paratoires (undergraduate school) or BTS (technician certificate).\n\n\n=== University of Lorraine ===\n\nMetz is also home to the University of Lorraine (often abbreviated as UdL).  \nThe university is divided into two university centers, one in Metz (material sciences, technology, and management) and one in Nancy (biological sciences, health care, administration, and management). The University of Lorraine, which ranks in 2016 among the top 15 of French universities and among the top 300 of universities in the world according to the 2016 Academic Ranking of World Universities, \n has a student body of over 55,000 and offers 101 accredited research centers organized in 9 research areas and 8 doctoral colleges.\n\n\n=== Graduate schools ===\nAt the end of the 1990s, the city expanded and the Metz Science Park was created in the southern area. Along with this expansion, several graduate schools took the opportunity to establish campuses in the park. At first, facilities were grouped around the lake Symphony, like Sup\u00e9lec in 1985 and Georgia Tech Lorraine in 1990. In 1996, the engineering school Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech (ENSAM) built a research and learning center next to the golf course. This opened the way to the development of a new area, where the Franco-German university (ISFATES) and the ENIM moved in 2010. These graduate schools often cooperate with the University of Lorraine. For instance, the university and ENSAM share research teams, laboratories, equipments, and doctoral programs.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\nPublic transport includes a bus rapid transit system, called Mettis. Mettis vehicles are high-capacity hybrid bi-articulated buses built by Van Hool, and stop at designated elevated tubes, complete with disability access. Mettis has its own planned and integrated transportation system, which includes two dedicated lines that spread out into the Metz conurbation. Mettis lanes A and B serve the city's major facilities (e.g., city centre, university campus, and hospitals), and a transport hub is located next to the railway station.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nMetz Railway Station is connected to the French high speed train (TGV) network, which provides a direct rail service to Paris and Luxembourg. The time from Paris (Gare de l'Est) to Metz is 82 minutes. Additionally, Metz is served by the Lorraine TGV railway station, located at Louvigny, 25 km (16 mi) to the south of Metz, for high speed trains going to Nantes, Rennes, Lille and Bordeaux (without stopping in Paris). Also, Metz is one of the main stations of the regional express trains system, M\u00e9trolor.\n\n\n=== Motorways ===\nMetz is located at the intersection of two major road axes: the Eastern Motorway, itself a part of the European route E50 connecting Paris to Prague, and the A31 Motorway, which goes north to Luxembourg and south to the Mediterranean Sea towards Nancy, Dijon, and Lyon.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nThe Luxembourg International Airport is the nearest international airport, connected to Metz by M\u00e9trolor train.

      "name": "Place Stanislas",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Place Stanislas is a large pedestrianised square in the French city of Nancy, in the Lorraine region.  Since 1983, the architectural ensemble comprising the Place Stanislas, the extension of its axis, the Place de la Carri\u00e8re, and the Place d'Alliance, has been on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nAfter the War of the Polish Succession in 1737, the Duchy of Upper Lorraine, of which Nancy was the capital, was given to Stanis\u0142aw I Leszczy\u0144ski, former Ruler of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and father-in-law to King Louis XV of France.  An earlier ruler, Leopold, Duke of Lorraine, had undertaken much reconstruction in Lorraine, which had been ravaged by a series of wars.  He had recruited numerous artists and architects for this work, including Germain Boffrand, who trained Emmanuel H\u00e9r\u00e9.  Hence, Stanis\u0142aw found a pool of talent and experience to draw from on his arrival.\n\n\n=== Design and construction ===\n\nThe square was a major project in urban planning, conceived by Stanis\u0142aw I as a way to link the medieval old town of Nancy and the \"new\" town built in the 17th century under Charles III, Duke of Lorraine. The square was also intended as a place royale to honour Stanis\u0142aw's son-in-law, Louis XV.  The design created a large urban square or place that linked two handsome existing buildings: the H\u00f4tel de Ville (city hall, now centred on its grand square) and the H\u00f4tel du Gouvernement, the seat of the duchy.  The seat of city government and the seat of Ducal government thus faced each other as complements through a series of rational, symmetrical but varied urban spaces, unequalled in Europe at the time.\nThe square and the surrounding buildings, unified by their colossal orders, were designed by the royal architect Emmanuel H\u00e9r\u00e9 de Corny (1705\u20131763).  Construction began in March 1752, and ended in November 1755.  Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Guibal and Paul-Louis Cyffl\u00e9 created a bronze statue of Louis XV that was erected in the center of the square. It was removed during the iconoclasm of the Revolution, when it was replaced with a simple winged figure.  The square was renamed 'Place du Peuple', and later 'Place Napol\u00e9on'.\nIn 1831, a bronze statue of Stanis\u0142aw (Stanislas in French) was placed in the middle of the square; since then it has been known as the 'Place Stanislas'.\nThe square has always been used for public assemblies and festivities. It has undergone several makeovers in its history and, in a low period of appreciation, served as a car parking area for nearly a quarter of a century, between 1958 and 1983.  \nThe city has since reserved it for pedestrian use. In 2004 and 2005, the city undertook a massive restoration of the square, based on the original 18th-century plans. The ten-month project cost approximately 9 million euros. It was financed by a combination of city and local, regional, national and private funds. The inauguration of the new Place Stanislas, in May 2005, coincided with the square's 250th anniversary.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe Place Stanislas is 125 metre long and 106 metre wide.  It is paved with light ochre stones, with two lines of darker stones forming a diagonal cross motif.  The square is surrounded by an architecturally harmonious ensemble of buildings, most notably these:\n\nThe City Hall (H\u00f4tel de Ville) of Nancy, which occupies the entire south side of the square, with the prefectural office of Meurthe-et-Moselle at the south-east corner;\nTo the east, the Opera house (formerly the Bishop's Palace) and the Grand H\u00f4tel (originally the H\u00f4tel de la Reine, actually occupied by the Intendant Alliot);\nTo the west, the Fine Arts Museum (originally the Coll\u00e8ge de m\u00e9decine) and the Pavillon Jacquet (originally a commercial/residential building, now mostly offices);\nOn the north side, the buildings were kept lower for defensive purposes (to permit crossfire between the Vaudemont and the Haussonville bastions).The Arc H\u00e9r\u00e9, a triumphal arch built by Emmanuel H\u00e9r\u00e9 de Corny, stands in the centre of the fourth side, leading to the adjoining Place de la Carri\u00e8re, where the main axis is developed as a double avenue of trees, with symmetrical buildings facing each other down its length.\nThe far end is defined by the hemi-cycles of colonnades that enclose the sides and are carried across the pre-existing fa\u00e7ade of the Palais du Gouvernement.\nThe four corners and the west and east sides of the square feature gilded wrought iron gates and lanterns, created by Jean Lamour (1698\u20131771); who was also responsible for the wrought iron balustrade on the main staircase in the H\u00f4tel de Ville, and the balcony across the centre of its main fa\u00e7ade.  The north-west and north-east corners also feature ornate fountains designed by Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Guibal (1699\u20131757). Because of these gates, Nancy is nicknamed City with Golden Gates (Ville aux Portes d'Or).\n\n\n=== Central statue ===\nThe statue in the centre of the Place Stanislas, created by Georges Jacquot, represents Stanislas standing, dressed in flowing robes, holding a sword in his left hand and pointing towards the north with his right hand.  The inscriptions on the high marble pedestal read:\n\n\n=== H\u00f4tel de Ville ===\n\nThe H\u00f4tel de Ville (City Hall), also known as Palais de Stanislas (Stanislas's Palace), is the largest building in the square at 98 metres long, and occupies the whole south side of the square.  Built in 1752\u20131755, it has served as the city hall since its construction.  It was designated as a monument historique on 12 July 1886.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of World Heritage Sites in Europe\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nSimon, Pierre. 1994.

        "wiki": "Metz ( METS, French: [m\u025bs] (listen), Lorraine Franconian: [m\u025bts]) Latin: Divodurum Mediomatricorum is a city in northeast France located at the confluence of the Moselle and the Seille rivers. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle department and the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region. Located near the tripoint along the junction of France, Germany, and Luxembourg, the city forms a central place of the European Greater Region and the SaarLorLux euroregion.Metz has a rich 3,000-year-history, having variously been a Celtic oppidum, an important Gallo-Roman city, the Merovingian capital of Austrasia, the birthplace of the Carolingian dynasty, a cradle of the Gregorian chant, and one of the oldest republics in Europe. The city has been steeped in Romance culture, but has been strongly influenced by Germanic culture due to its location and history.Because of its historical, cultural, and architectural background, Metz has been submitted on France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. The city features noteworthy buildings such as the Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral with its largest expanse of stained-glass windows in the world, the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains being the oldest church in France, its Imperial Station Palace displaying the apartment of the German Kaiser, or its Opera House, the oldest one working in France. Metz is home to some world-class venues including the Arsenal Concert Hall and the Centre Pompidou-Metz museum.\nA basin of urban ecology, Metz gained its nickname of The Green City (French: La Ville Verte), as it has extensive open grounds and public gardens. The historic city centre is one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France.A historic garrison town, Metz is the economic heart of the Lorraine region, specialising in information technology and automotive industries. Metz is home to the University of Lorraine, Georgia Tech Lorraine, and a centre for applied research and development in the materials sector, notably in metallurgy and metallography, the heritage of the Lorraine region's past in the iron and steel industry.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn ancient times, the town was known as \"city of Mediomatrici\", being inhabited by the tribe of the same name. After its integration into the Roman Empire, the city was called Divodurum Mediomatricum, meaning Holy Village or Holy Fortress of the Mediomatrici, then it was known as Mediomatrix. During the 5th century AD, the name evolved to \"Mettis\", which gave rise to Metz.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMetz has a recorded history dating back over 2,000 years. Before the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar in 52 BC, it was the oppidum of the Celtic Mediomatrici tribe. Integrated into the Roman Empire, Metz became quickly one of the principal towns of Gaul with a population of 40,000, until the barbarian depredations and its transfer to the Franks about the end of the 5th century. Between the 6th and 8th centuries, the city was the residence of the Merovingian kings of Austrasia. After the Treaty of Verdun in 843, Metz became the capital of the Kingdom of Lotharingia and was ultimately integrated into the Holy Roman Empire, being granted semi-independent status. During the 12th century, Metz became a republic and the Republic of Metz stood until the 15th century.With the signature of the Treaty of Chambord in 1552, Metz passed to the hands of the Kings of France. As the German Protestant Princes who traded Metz (alongside Toul and Verdun) for the promise of French military assistance, had no authority to cede territory of the Holy Roman Empire, the change of jurisdiction wasn't recognised by the Holy Roman Empire until the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. Under French rule, Metz was selected as capital of the Three Bishoprics and became a strategic fortified town. With creation of the departments by the Estates-General of 1789, Metz was chosen as capital of the Department of Moselle. Although French-speaking, after the Franco-Prussian War and according to the Treaty of Frankfurt of 1871, the city was annexed into the German Empire, being part of the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine and serving as capital of the Bezirk Lothringen.Metz remained German until the end of World War I, when it reverted to France. However, after the Battle of France during the Second World War, the city was annexed once more by the German Third Reich. In 1944, the attack on the city by the U.S. Third Army freed the city from German rule and Metz reverted one more time to France after World War II.During the 1950s, Metz was chosen to be the capital of the newly created Lorraine region. With the creation of the European Community and the later European Union, the city has become central to the Greater Region and the SaarLorLux Euroregion.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMetz is located on the banks of the Moselle and the Seille rivers, 43 km (26.7 mi) from the Schengen tripoint where the borders of France, Germany, and Luxembourg meet. The city was built in a place where many branches of the Moselle river creates several islands, which are encompassed within the urban planning.The terrain of Metz forms part of the Paris Basin and presents a plateau relief cut by river valleys presenting cuestas in the north\u2013south direction. Metz and its surrounding countryside are included in the forest and crop Lorraine Regional Natural Park, covering a total area of 205,000 ha (506,566.0 acres).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of Lorraine is a semi-continental climate. The summers are warm and humid, sometimes stormy, and the warmest month of the year is July, when daytime temperatures average approximately 25 \u00b0C (77.0 \u00b0F). The winters are cold and snowy with temperature dropping to an average low of \u22120.5 \u00b0C (31.1 \u00b0F) in January. Lows can be much colder through the night and early morning and the snowy period extends from November to February.The length of the day varies significantly over the course of the year. The shortest day is 21 December with 7:30 hours of sunlight; the longest day is 20 June with 16:30 hours of sunlight. The median cloud cover is 93% and does not vary substantially over the course of the year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nThe inhabitants of Metz are called Messin(e)s. Statistics on the ethnic and religious make up of the population of Metz are haphazard, as the French Republic prohibits making distinctions between citizens regarding race, beliefs, and political and philosophic opinions in the process of census taking. This would otherwise document the city to be a Germanic locale, as is the rest of the province and the neighboring Alsace.The French national census of 2012 estimated the population of Metz to be 119,551, while the population of Metz urban agglomeration was about 389,851. Through history, Metz's population has been impacted by the vicissitudes of the wars and annexations involving the city, which have prevented continuous population growth. More recently, the city has suffered from the restructuring of the military and the metallurgy industry. The historical population for the current area of Metz municipality is as follows:\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\nSeveral well-known figures have been linked to the city of Metz throughout its history. Renowned Messins include poet Paul Verlaine, composer Ambroise Thomas, and mathematician Jean-Victor Poncelet; numerous well-known German figures were also born in Metz notably during the annexation periods. Moreover, the city has been the residence of people such as writer Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Cardinal Mazarin, political thinker Alexis de Tocqueville, French patriot and American Revolutionary War hero Marquis Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette, and Luxembourg-born German-French statesman Robert Schuman.\n\n\n== Law and government ==\n\n\n=== Local law ===\n\nThe Local Law (French: droit local) applied in Metz is a legal system that operates in parallel with French law. Created in 1919, it preserves the French laws applied in France before 1870 and maintained by the Germans during the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, but repealed in the rest of France after 1871. It also maintains German laws enacted by the German Empire between 1871 and 1918, specific provisions adopted by the local authorities, and French laws that have been enacted after 1919 to be applicable only in Alsace-Lorraine. This specific local legislation encompasses different areas including religion, social work and finance.\nThe most striking of the legal differences between France and Alsace-Lorraine is the absence in Alsace-Lorraine of strict secularism, even though a constitutional right of freedom of religion is guaranteed by the French government. Alsace-Lorraine is still governed by a pre-1905 law established by the Concordat of 1801, which provides for the public subsidy of the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches and the Jewish religion.\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\nLike every commune of the present French Republic, Metz is managed by a mayor (French: maire) and a municipal council (French: conseil municipal), democratically elected by two-round proportional voting for six years. The mayor is assisted by 54 municipal councillors, and the municipal council is held on the last Thursday of every month. Since 2008, the mayor of Metz has been socialist Dominique Gros.The city belongs to the Metz Metropole union of cities, which includes the 40 cities of the Metz urban agglomeration. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle based in the former Intendant Palace. In addition, Metz is the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region, hosted in the former Saint-Clement Abbey.\n\n\n=== City administrative divisions ===\n\nThe city of Metz is divided into 14 administrative divisions:\n\n\n== Cityscape and environmental policy ==\n\nMetz contains a mishmash of architectural layers, bearing witness to centuries of history at the crossroads of different cultures, and features a number of architectural landmarks. The city possesses one of the largest Urban Conservation Areas in France, and more than 100 of the city's buildings are classified on the Monument Historique list. Because of its historical and cultural background, Metz is designated as French Town of Art and History, and has been submitted on to France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List.The city is famous for its yellow limestone architecture, a result of the extensive use of Jaumont stone. The historic district has kept part of the Gallo-Roman city with Divodurum's Cardo Maximus, then called Via Scarponensis (today the Trinitaires, Taison, and Serpenoise streets), and the Decumanus Maximus (today En Fournirue and d'Estr\u00e9es streets). At the Cardo and Decumanus intersection was situated the Roman forum, today the Saint-Jacques Square.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nFrom its Gallo-Roman past, the city preserves vestiges of the thermae (in the basement of the Golden Courtyard museum), parts of the aqueduct, and the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains.Saint Louis' square with its vaulted arcades and a Knights Templar chapel remains a major symbol of the city's High Medieval heritage. The Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral, several churches and H\u00f4tels, and two remarkable municipal granaries reflect the Late Middle Ages. Examples of Renaissance architecture can be seen in H\u00f4tels from the 16th century, such as the House of Heads (French: Maison des T\u00eates).The city hall and the buildings surrounding the town square are by French architect Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Blondel, who was awarded the task of redesigning and modernizing the centre of Metz by the Royal Academy of Architecture in 1755 the context of the Enlightenment. Neoclassical buildings from the 18th century, such as the Opera House, the Intendant Palace (the present-day prefecture), and the Royal Governor's Palace (the present-day courthouse) built by Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau, are also found in the city.The Imperial District was built during the first annexation of Metz by the German Empire. In order to \"germanise\" the city, Emperor Wilhelm II decided to create a new district shaped by a distinctive blend of Germanic architecture, including Renaissance, neo-Romanesque and neo-Classical, mixed with elements of Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Alsatian and mock-Bavarian styles. Instead of Jaumont stone, commonly used everywhere else in the city, stone used in the Rhineland, such as pink and grey sandstone, granite and basalt were used. The district features noteworthy buildings including the rail station and the Central Post Office by German architect J\u00fcrgen Kr\u00f6ger.Modern architecture can also be seen in the town with works of French architects Roger-Henri Expert (Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-de-l'Enfant-J\u00e9sus church, 1934), Georges-Henri Pingusson (Fire Station, 1960), and Jean Dubuisson (subdivisions, 1960s). The refurbishment of the former Ney Arsenal as a Concert Hall in 1989 and the erection of the Metz Arena in 2002, by Spanish and French architects Ricardo Bofill and French Paul Chemetov represent the Postmodern movement.The Centre Pompidou-Metz museum in the Amphitheatre District represents a strong architectural initiative to mark the entrance of Metz into the 21st century. Designed by Japanese architect Shigeru Ban, the building is remarkable for the complex, innovative carpentry of its roof, and integrates concepts of sustainable architecture. The project encompasses the architecture of two recipients of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, Shigeru Ban (2014) and French Christian de Portzamparc (1994). The Amphitheatre District is also conceived by French architects Nicolas Michelin, Jean-Paul Viguier, and Jean-Michel Wilmotte and designer Philippe Starck. The urban project is expected to be completed by 2023. Further, a contemporary music venue designed by contextualist French architect Rudy Ricciotti stands in the Borny District.\n\n\n=== Urban ecology ===\n\nUnder the leadership of such people as botanist Jean-Marie Pelt, Metz pioneered a policy of urban ecology during the early 1970s. Because of the failure of post-war urban planning and housing estate development in Europe during the 1960s, mostly based on the concepts of CIAM, Jean-Marie Pelt, then municipal councillor of Metz, initiated a new approach to the urban environment.Based initially on the ideas of the Chicago School, Pelt's theories pleaded for better integration of humans into their environment and developed a concept centered on the relationship between \"stone and water\". His policy was realized in Metz by the establishment of extensive open areas surrounding the Moselle and the Seille rivers and the development of large pedestrian areas. As a result, Metz has over 37 m2 (400 sq ft) of open areas per inhabitant in the form of numerous public gardens in the city.The principles of urban ecology are still applied in Metz with the implementation of a local Agenda 21 action plan. The municipal ecological policy encompasses the sustainable refurbishment of ancient buildings, the erection of sustainable districts and buildings, green public transport, and the creation of public gardens by means of landscape architecture.Additionally, the city has developed its own combined heat and power station, using waste wood biomass from the surrounding forests as a renewable energy source. With a thermal efficiency above 80%, the 45MW boiler of the plant provides electricity and heat for 44,000 dwellings. The Metz power station is the first local producer and distributor of energy in France.\n\n\n=== Military architecture ===\n\nAs a historic Garrison town, Metz has been heavily influenced by military architecture throughout its history. From ancient history to the present, the city has been successively fortified and modified to accommodate the troops stationed there. Defensive walls from classical antiquity to the 20th century are still visible today, incorporated into the design of public gardens along the Moselle and Seille rivers. A medieval bridge castle from the 13th century, named Germans' Gate (French: Porte des Allemands), today converted into a convention and exhibition centre, has become one of the landmarks of the city. It is still possible to see parts of the 16th century citadel, as well as fortifications built in the 1740s by Louis de Cormontaigne but based on designs by Vauban. Important barracks, mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries, are spread around the city: some, which are of architectural interest, have been converted to civilian use, such as the Arsenal Concert Hall by Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill.\nThe extensive fortifications of Metz, which ring the city, include early examples of S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res system forts. Other forts were incorporated into the Maginot Line. A hiking trail on the Saint-Quentin plateau passes through a former military training zone and ends at the now abandoned military forts, providing a vantage point from which to survey the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAlthough the steel industry has historically dominated Moselle's economy, Metz's efforts at economic diversification have created a base in the sectors of commerce, tourism, information technology and the automotive industry. The city is the economic heart of the Lorraine region and around 73,000 people work daily within the urban agglomeration. The transport facilities found in the conurbation, including the international high-speed railway, motorway, inland connections and the local bus rapid transit system, have made the city a transport hub in the heart of the European Union. Metz is home to the biggest harbour handling cereals in France with over 4,000,000 tons/year.Metz is home to the Moselle Chamber of Commerce. International companies such as PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, ArcelorMittal, SFR, and TDF have established plants and centres in the Metz conurbation. Metz is also the regional headquarters of the Caisse d'Epargne and Banque Populaire banking groups.\nMetz is an important commercial centre of northern France with France's biggest retailer federation, consisting of around 2,000 retailers. Important retail companies are found in the city, such as the Galeries Lafayette, the Printemps department store and the Fnac entertainment retail chain. The historic city centre displays one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France and a mall, the Saint-Jacques centre. In addition there are several multiplex movie theatres and malls found in the urban agglomeration.\nIn recent years, Metz municipality have promoted an ambitious policy of tourism development, including urban revitalization and refurbishment of buildings and public squares. This policy has been spurred by the creation of the Centre Pompidou-Metz in 2010. Since its inauguration, the institution has become the most popular cultural venue in France outside Paris, with 550,000 visitors per year. Meanwhile, Saint-Stephen Cathedral is the most visited building in the city, accommodating 652,000 visitors per year.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums and exhibition halls ===\n\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz is a museum of modern and contemporary arts, the largest temporary exhibition area in France outside Paris.

The cathedral exhibits the collection of the Bishopric of Metz, including paraments and items used in the service of the Eucharist. Metz Cathedral is sometimes nicknamed the Good Lord's Lantern (French: la Lanterne du Bon Dieu), as it has the largest expanse of stained glass windows in the world: 6,500 m2 (70,000 sq ft). These include works by Gothic and Renaissance master glass makers Hermann von M\u00fcnster, Th\u00e9obald of Lixheim, and Valentin Bousch, romantic Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, tachist Roger Bissi\u00e8re, cubist Jacques Villon and modernist Marc Chagall.\nAnother of the city's churches displays a complete set of stained glass windows by French modernist Jean Cocteau.In addition, Metz features other museums and exhibition venues, such as:\n\nThe FRAC Lorraine, a public collection of contemporary art of the Lorraine region. It is located in the 12th-century Saint-Liver H\u00f4tel and organizes exhibitions of local and international contemporary artists.\nThe Golden Courtyard (French: la Cour d'Or), a museum dedicated to the history of Metz, divided into four sections (e.g. archeology, medieval, architecture, and fine arts). The Golden Courtyard displays a rich collection of Gallo-Roman and medieval finds and the remains of the Gallo-Roman baths of Divodurum Mediomatricum, revealed by the extension works to the museums in the 1930s.\nThe Museum of the 1870 War and of the Annexion in Gravelotte, a village located within the Metz-Metropole conurbation and the site of the Battle of Gravelotte, the only museum in Europe dedicated to the Franco-Prussian War. The museum exhibits military and everyday items from the period as well as artworks related to the 1870 war. A mausoleum erected in 1904 honoring the soldiers who died during the battle, the Memorial Hall (French: La Halle du Souvenir), has been included in the museum.\nThe House for Europe, located on the estate of Robert Schuman in Scy-Chazelles in the Metz-Metropole conurbation, transformed into a museum and convention centre. Across the street is the fortified 12th Century church where Robert Schuman now rests. The Robert Schuman House for Europe organises cultural and educational events that introduce the visitor to Schuman's life and works and to the way Europe has been constructed and continues to develop today.\nVerlaine's House (French: la Maison de Verlaine) is a museum located in the house where the poet Paul Verlaine was born, dedicated to his work, featuring permanent and temporary exhibitions. The Solange Bertrand foundation, located in the artist's former house, conserves and displays her artworks. The municipal archives preserve and exhibit Metz's historical municipal records dating from medieval times to the present.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\nMetz has several venues for the performing arts. The Opera House of Metz, the oldest working opera house in France, features plays, dance, and lyric poetry. The Arsenal Concert Hall, dedicated to art music, is widely renowned for its excellent acoustics. The Trinitarians Club is a multi-media arts complex housed in the vaulted cellar and chapel of an ancient convent, the city's prime venue for jazz music. The Music Box (French: Boite \u00e0 Musique), familiarly known as BAM, is the concert venue dedicated to rock and electronic music. The Braun Hall and the Kolt\u00e8s Theater feature plays, and the city has two movie theaters specializing in Auteur cinema. The Saint-Jacques Square, surrounded by busy bars and pubs whose open-air tables fill the centre of the square.\nSince 2014, the former bus garage has been converted to accommodate over thirty artists in residence, in a space where they can create and rehearse artworks and even build set decorations. The artistic complex, called Metz Network of All Cultures (French: Toutes les Cultures en R\u00e9seau \u00e0 Metz) and familiarly known as TCRM-Blida, encompasses a large hall of 3,000 m2 (32,000 sq ft) while theater and dance companies benefit from a studio of 800 m2 (8,600 sq ft) with backstages.\n\n\n=== Metz in the arts ===\nMetz was an important cultural centre during the Carolingian Renaissance. For instance, Gregorian chant was created in Metz during the 8th century as a fusion of Gallican and ancient Roman repertory. Then called Messin Chant, it remains the oldest form of music still in use in Western Europe. The bishops of Metz, notably Saint-Chrodegang promoted its use for the Roman liturgy in Gallic lands under the favorable influence of the Carolingian monarchs. Messin chant made two major contributions to the body of chant: it fitted the chant into the ancient Greek octoechos system, and invented an innovative musical notation, using neumes to show the shape of a remembered melody. Metz was also an important centre of illumination of Carolingian manuscripts, producing such monuments of Carolingian book illumination as the Drogo Sacramentary.The Metz School (French: \u00c9cole de Metz) was an art movement in Metz and the region between 1834 and 1870, centred on Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal. The term was originally proposed in 1845 by the poet Charles Baudelaire, who appreciated the works of the artists. They were influenced by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix and inspired by the medieval heritage of Metz and its romantic surroundings. The Franco-Prussian War and the annexation of the territory by the Germans resulted in the dismantling of the movement. The main figures of the Metz School were Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, Auguste Migette, Auguste Hussenot, Louis-Th\u00e9odore Devilly, Christopher Fratin, and Charles P\u00eatre. Their works include paintings, engravings, drawings, stained-glass windows, and sculptures.\nA festival named \"passages\" takes place in May. Numerous shows are presented to it.\n\n\n=== The Graoully dragon as symbol of the city ===\n\nThe Graoully is depicted as a fearsome dragon, vanquished by the sacred powers of Saint Clement of Metz, the first Bishop of the city. The Graoully quickly became a symbol of Metz and can be seen in numerous insignia of the city, from the 10th century on. Writers from Metz tend to present the legend as an allegory of Christianity's victory over paganism, represented by the harmful dragon.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nLocal specialties include the quiche, the pot\u00e9e, the Lorrain p\u00e2t\u00e9, and also suckling pig. Different recipes, such as jam, tart, charcuterie and fruit brandy, are made from the Mirabelle and Damson plums. Also, Metz is the cradle of some pastries like the Metz cheese pie and the Metz Balls (French: boulet de Metz), a ganache-stuffed biscuit coated with marzipan, caramel, and dark chocolate. Local beverages include Moselle wine and Amos beer.The Covered Market of Metz is one of the oldest, most grandiose in France and is home to traditional local food producers and retailers. Originally built as the bishop's palace, the French Revolution broke out before the Bishop of Metz could move in and the citizens decided to turn it into a food market. The adjacent Chamber's Square (French: Place de la Chambre) is surrounded by numerous local food restaurants.\n\n\n=== Celebrations and events ===\nMany events are celebrated in Metz throughout the year. The city of Metz dedicates two weeks to the Mirabelle plum during the popular Mirabelle Festival held in August. During the festival, in addition to open markets selling fresh plums, mirabelle tarts, and mirabelle liquor, there are live music, fireworks, parties, art exhibits, a parade with floral floats, a competition, the crowning of the Mirabelle Queen and a gala of celebration.A literature festival is held in June.

Along with this expansion, several graduate schools took the opportunity to establish campuses in the park. At first, facilities were grouped around the lake Symphony, like Sup\u00e9lec in 1985 and Georgia Tech Lorraine in 1990. In 1996, the engineering school Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech (ENSAM) built a research and learning center next to the golf course. This opened the way to the development of a new area, where the Franco-German university (ISFATES) and the ENIM moved in 2010. These graduate schools often cooperate with the University of Lorraine. For instance, the university and ENSAM share research teams, laboratories, equipments, and doctoral programs.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\nPublic transport includes a bus rapid transit system, called Mettis. Mettis vehicles are high-capacity hybrid bi-articulated buses built by Van Hool, and stop at designated elevated tubes, complete with disability access.

        "wiki": "The Centre Pompidou-Metz is a museum of modern and contemporary art located in Metz, capital of Lorraine, France. It is a branch of Pompidou arts centre of Paris, and features semi-permanent and temporary exhibitions from the large collection of the French National Museum of Modern Art, the largest European collection of 20th and 21st century arts. The museum is the largest temporary exhibition space outside Paris in France with 5,000 m2 (54,000 sq ft) divided between 3 galleries, a theatre, and an auditorium.\nThe first piece of the monument designed by Japanese architect Shigeru Ban was laid on November 7, 2006, and the building was inaugurated by French President Nicolas Sarkozy on May 12, 2010. The building is remarkable for its roof structure, one of the largest and most complex built to date, which was inspired by a Chinese hat found in Paris by Shigeru Ban.Since its inauguration, the institution has become one of the most visited cultural venues in France outside Paris.\n\n\n== Architecture and urban design ==\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz is a large hexagon structured round a central spire reaching 77 m (253 ft), alluding to the 1977 opening date of the original Centre Pompidou of Paris. It possesses three rectangular galleries (Gallery 1, 2, and 3) weaving through the building at different levels, jutting out through the roof with huge picture windows angled towards landmarks such as the Saint-Stephen Gothic cathedral, the Imperial railway station, the Arsenal Concert Hall built by Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill, the Ar\u00e8nes indoor sport arena built by French architect Paul Chemetov, and the Seille park. The great nave covers 1,200 m2 (13,000 sq ft) and provides flexibility for the exhibition of large artworks, with the ceiling rising progressively from a height of 5.7 m (19 ft) to 18 m (59 ft).\n\nThe roof is the major achievement of the building: a 90 m (300 ft) wide hexagon echoing the building's floor map. With a surface area of 8,000 m2 (86,000 sq ft), the roof structure is composed of sixteen kilometres of glued laminated timber, that intersect to form hexagonal wooden units resembling the cane-work pattern of a Chinese hat. The roof's geometry is irregular, featuring curves and counter-curves over the entire building, and in particular the three exhibition galleries. Imitating this kind of hat and its protective fabric, the entire wooden structure is covered with a white fibreglass membrane and a coating of teflon, which has the distinction of being self-cleaning, protecting from direct sunlight, while providing a transparent view at night. The roof structure can be seen from high up during both day and night in Metz from above, an aerial movie made by French photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand.The Centre Pompidou-Metz includes also a restaurant terrace, for which French designer Patrick Jouin and Kenyan architect Sanjit Manku produced interior spaces inspired by the image of a kaleidoscope.  The museum-surrounding garden has been thought by French landscape architect Jean de Gastine using the concepts of sustainable gardening.\nThe museum is the cornerstone of the newly created Amphitheater District of Metz. The district of 50 ha (123.6 acres), thought by French architects Nicolas Michelin, Jean-Paul Viguier, and Christian de Portzamparc, and designer Philippe Starck, is currently under construction and includes the edification of a convention centre and a shopping mall. The quarter encompasses already the Seille park designed by French landscape architect Jacques Coulon and the Ar\u00e8nes indoor sport arena built in 2002. The urban project completion is expected to take place by 2016.  Swiss designer Ruedi Baur created the Metz's signage systems.\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz and its forecourt, named Human Rights square, are built on the site of the Roman amphitheatre of Divodurum Medriomaticum (ancestor of present-day Metz), near the Metz Imperial District and the Station Palace.\n\n\n== Exhibitions and performances ==\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz also displays around 3 to 4 unique temporary exhibitions per year, which are not presented elsewhere. Most of the artworks exhibited are from the large collection of the National Museum of Modern Art, which encompasses the largest European collection of modern and contemporary arts and the second in the world. The museum works in close collaboration with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Luxembourgian Museum of Modern Art, or the Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe in joint initiatives.\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz promotes the local art scene in collaborating with the Regional Contemporary Art Fund of Lorraine. In addition to the temporary exhibitions, the Centre Pompidou-Metz museum features seasonal programming with contemporary live shows in its theater and organizes meetings and conferences in its auditorium with worldly recognized, as well as, local artists.\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz edifice and surrounding Metz are sometimes used as support for the artistic production displayed during the temporary exhibitions. For example, the architectural structure of the Centre Pompidou-Metz was used as support for a visual art project by French visual artists Simon Geilfus, Yannick Jacquet, and Thomas Vaqui\u00e9. Also, French aerial photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand captured Metz from high up, giving a privileged views of the museum and the city for the exhibition Views from above.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n\n\n== Transport and access ==\n\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz is located in the centre of Metz and is served by Mettis local public transport. Also, the museum is located near the Imperial railway station of Metz, which is connected to the French high speed train network via the LGV East line, which provides a direct rail service to Paris and the city of Luxembourg. The time from Paris East station and France international Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport to Metz railway station is about 82 and 75 minutes, respectively. Finally, Metz is located at the intersection of two major road axes: the Paris to Strasbourg A4 motorway and the A31 north-south motorway.\n\n\n== Beacons exhibition ==\nBased entirely on loans from the collection at French National Museum of Modern Art, the Beacons exhibition is semi-permanent exhibition that highlights since 2014 a selection of 18 masterpieces rarely shown to the public due to their monumental size. The exhibition's staging provides an overview of the primary movements in art since the start of the 20th century, from Pablo Picasso to Anish Kapoor including Sam Francis, Joseph Beuys, Dan Flavin, and Joan Mir\u00f3. Art works exhibited include:\n\nFigures and Birds in the Night, Joan Mir\u00f3\nSurvivors, Yan Pei-Ming\nHomogenous Infiltration for Piano, Joseph Beuys\nReflexions of a Waterfall I, Louise Nevelson\nTabula, Simon Hanta\u00ef\nEntrance to the Railway Pavilion, Robert Delaunay\nStage curtain for the ballet Mercure, Pablo Picasso\nComposition with Two Parrots, Fernand L\u00e9ger\nOrangey, Light Blue Forms, Claude Viallat\nPalombe, Frank Stella\nPainting 202 x 453 cm, 29 June 1979, Pierre Soulages\nAware II, 28.3.1961, Jean Degottex\nLost World, Pierre Alechinsky\nIn Lovely Blueness, Sam Francis\nFor a Little While, Joan Mitchell\nUntitled, Anish Kapoor\nUntitled (to Donna) 5a, Dan Flavin\nUntitled, Robert Irwin\n\n\n== Inaugural exhibition ==\nThe inaugural exhibition called Masterpieces? was devoted to masterpieces (about 800), of which over 700 were lent by the Centre Georges Pompidou of Paris. The exhibition considered the relevance of the idea of masterpiece and ran until January 17, 2011. The exhibition has attracted over 800,000 visitors during the following year of its inauguration and included:\n\nWoman with a Guitar, Georges Braque\nKing's Sadness, Henri Matisse\nThe Aubade, Lying Nude near Musician, Pablo Picasso\nGuernica, Pablo Picasso\nIngres's Violin, photographie, Man Ray\nBlack cross, Kasimir Malevitch\nBlue I, Blue II, Blue III triptych, Joan Mir\u00f3\nReliefs for the Stairs of the Railway Palace, Robert Delaunay\nCapricorn, Max Ernst\nThe Background, Jackson Pollock\nStanding Woman, Alberto Giacometti\nSleeping Muse, Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i\nThe Tropical House, Jean Prouv\u00e9The four parts of the exhibition were:\n\nGreat nave: Masterpieces throughout history\nGallery 1: Stories behind masterpieces\nGallery 2: Masterpiece dreams\nGallery 3: Masterpieces ad infinitum\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCentre Pompidou - Metz website\nArchitect Shiregu Ban's website\nMetz municipal council website\nMetz-Metropole website\nWebsite of tourism office of Metz \nWebsite of tourism office of Lorraine",

        "wiki": "Metz ( METS, French: [m\u025bs] (listen), Lorraine Franconian: [m\u025bts]) Latin: Divodurum Mediomatricorum is a city in northeast France located at the confluence of the Moselle and the Seille rivers. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle department and the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region. Located near the tripoint along the junction of France, Germany, and Luxembourg, the city forms a central place of the European Greater Region and the SaarLorLux euroregion.Metz has a rich 3,000-year-history, having variously been a Celtic oppidum, an important Gallo-Roman city, the Merovingian capital of Austrasia, the birthplace of the Carolingian dynasty, a cradle of the Gregorian chant, and one of the oldest republics in Europe. The city has been steeped in Romance culture, but has been strongly influenced by Germanic culture due to its location and history.Because of its historical, cultural, and architectural background, Metz has been submitted on France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. The city features noteworthy buildings such as the Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral with its largest expanse of stained-glass windows in the world, the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains being the oldest church in France, its Imperial Station Palace displaying the apartment of the German Kaiser, or its Opera House, the oldest one working in France. Metz is home to some world-class venues including the Arsenal Concert Hall and the Centre Pompidou-Metz museum.\nA basin of urban ecology, Metz gained its nickname of The Green City (French: La Ville Verte), as it has extensive open grounds and public gardens. The historic city centre is one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France.A historic garrison town, Metz is the economic heart of the Lorraine region, specialising in information technology and automotive industries. Metz is home to the University of Lorraine, Georgia Tech Lorraine, and a centre for applied research and development in the materials sector, notably in metallurgy and metallography, the heritage of the Lorraine region's past in the iron and steel industry.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn ancient times, the town was known as \"city of Mediomatrici\", being inhabited by the tribe of the same name. After its integration into the Roman Empire, the city was called Divodurum Mediomatricum, meaning Holy Village or Holy Fortress of the Mediomatrici, then it was known as Mediomatrix. During the 5th century AD, the name evolved to \"Mettis\", which gave rise to Metz.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMetz has a recorded history dating back over 2,000 years. Before the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar in 52 BC, it was the oppidum of the Celtic Mediomatrici tribe. Integrated into the Roman Empire, Metz became quickly one of the principal towns of Gaul with a population of 40,000, until the barbarian depredations and its transfer to the Franks about the end of the 5th century. Between the 6th and 8th centuries, the city was the residence of the Merovingian kings of Austrasia. After the Treaty of Verdun in 843, Metz became the capital of the Kingdom of Lotharingia and was ultimately integrated into the Holy Roman Empire, being granted semi-independent status. During the 12th century, Metz became a republic and the Republic of Metz stood until the 15th century.With the signature of the Treaty of Chambord in 1552, Metz passed to the hands of the Kings of France. As the German Protestant Princes who traded Metz (alongside Toul and Verdun) for the promise of French military assistance, had no authority to cede territory of the Holy Roman Empire, the change of jurisdiction wasn't recognised by the Holy Roman Empire until the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. Under French rule, Metz was selected as capital of the Three Bishoprics and became a strategic fortified town. With creation of the departments by the Estates-General of 1789, Metz was chosen as capital of the Department of Moselle. Although French-speaking, after the Franco-Prussian War and according to the Treaty of Frankfurt of 1871, the city was annexed into the German Empire, being part of the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine and serving as capital of the Bezirk Lothringen.Metz remained German until the end of World War I, when it reverted to France. However, after the Battle of France during the Second World War, the city was annexed once more by the German Third Reich. In 1944, the attack on the city by the U.S. Third Army freed the city from German rule and Metz reverted one more time to France after World War II.During the 1950s, Metz was chosen to be the capital of the newly created Lorraine region. With the creation of the European Community and the later European Union, the city has become central to the Greater Region and the SaarLorLux Euroregion.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMetz is located on the banks of the Moselle and the Seille rivers, 43 km (26.7 mi) from the Schengen tripoint where the borders of France, Germany, and Luxembourg meet. The city was built in a place where many branches of the Moselle river creates several islands, which are encompassed within the urban planning.The terrain of Metz forms part of the Paris Basin and presents a plateau relief cut by river valleys presenting cuestas in the north\u2013south direction. Metz and its surrounding countryside are included in the forest and crop Lorraine Regional Natural Park, covering a total area of 205,000 ha (506,566.0 acres).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of Lorraine is a semi-continental climate. The summers are warm and humid, sometimes stormy, and the warmest month of the year is July, when daytime temperatures average approximately 25 \u00b0C (77.0 \u00b0F). The winters are cold and snowy with temperature dropping to an average low of \u22120.5 \u00b0C (31.1 \u00b0F) in January. Lows can be much colder through the night and early morning and the snowy period extends from November to February.The length of the day varies significantly over the course of the year. The shortest day is 21 December with 7:30 hours of sunlight; the longest day is 20 June with 16:30 hours of sunlight. The median cloud cover is 93% and does not vary substantially over the course of the year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nThe inhabitants of Metz are called Messin(e)s. Statistics on the ethnic and religious make up of the population of Metz are haphazard, as the French Republic prohibits making distinctions between citizens regarding race, beliefs, and political and philosophic opinions in the process of census taking. This would otherwise document the city to be a Germanic locale, as is the rest of the province and the neighboring Alsace.The French national census of 2012 estimated the population of Metz to be 119,551, while the population of Metz urban agglomeration was about 389,851. Through history, Metz's population has been impacted by the vicissitudes of the wars and annexations involving the city, which have prevented continuous population growth. More recently, the city has suffered from the restructuring of the military and the metallurgy industry. The historical population for the current area of Metz municipality is as follows:\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\nSeveral well-known figures have been linked to the city of Metz throughout its history. Renowned Messins include poet Paul Verlaine, composer Ambroise Thomas, and mathematician Jean-Victor Poncelet; numerous well-known German figures were also born in Metz notably during the annexation periods. Moreover, the city has been the residence of people such as writer Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Cardinal Mazarin, political thinker Alexis de Tocqueville, French patriot and American Revolutionary War hero Marquis Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette, and Luxembourg-born German-French statesman Robert Schuman.\n\n\n== Law and government ==\n\n\n=== Local law ===\n\nThe Local Law (French: droit local) applied in Metz is a legal system that operates in parallel with French law. Created in 1919, it preserves the French laws applied in France before 1870 and maintained by the Germans during the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, but repealed in the rest of France after 1871. It also maintains German laws enacted by the German Empire between 1871 and 1918, specific provisions adopted by the local authorities, and French laws that have been enacted after 1919 to be applicable only in Alsace-Lorraine. This specific local legislation encompasses different areas including religion, social work and finance.\nThe most striking of the legal differences between France and Alsace-Lorraine is the absence in Alsace-Lorraine of strict secularism, even though a constitutional right of freedom of religion is guaranteed by the French government. Alsace-Lorraine is still governed by a pre-1905 law established by the Concordat of 1801, which provides for the public subsidy of the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches and the Jewish religion.\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\nLike every commune of the present French Republic, Metz is managed by a mayor (French: maire) and a municipal council (French: conseil municipal), democratically elected by two-round proportional voting for six years. The mayor is assisted by 54 municipal councillors, and the municipal council is held on the last Thursday of every month. Since 2008, the mayor of Metz has been socialist Dominique Gros.The city belongs to the Metz Metropole union of cities, which includes the 40 cities of the Metz urban agglomeration. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle based in the former Intendant Palace. In addition, Metz is the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region, hosted in the former Saint-Clement Abbey.\n\n\n=== City administrative divisions ===\n\nThe city of Metz is divided into 14 administrative divisions:\n\n\n== Cityscape and environmental policy ==\n\nMetz contains a mishmash of architectural layers, bearing witness to centuries of history at the crossroads of different cultures, and features a number of architectural landmarks. The city possesses one of the largest Urban Conservation Areas in France, and more than 100 of the city's buildings are classified on the Monument Historique list. Because of its historical and cultural background, Metz is designated as French Town of Art and History, and has been submitted on to France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List.The city is famous for its yellow limestone architecture, a result of the extensive use of Jaumont stone. The historic district has kept part of the Gallo-Roman city with Divodurum's Cardo Maximus, then called Via Scarponensis (today the Trinitaires, Taison, and Serpenoise streets), and the Decumanus Maximus (today En Fournirue and d'Estr\u00e9es streets). At the Cardo and Decumanus intersection was situated the Roman forum, today the Saint-Jacques Square.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nFrom its Gallo-Roman past, the city preserves vestiges of the thermae (in the basement of the Golden Courtyard museum), parts of the aqueduct, and the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains.Saint Louis' square with its vaulted arcades and a Knights Templar chapel remains a major symbol of the city's High Medieval heritage. The Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral, several churches and H\u00f4tels, and two remarkable municipal granaries reflect the Late Middle Ages. Examples of Renaissance architecture can be seen in H\u00f4tels from the 16th century, such as the House of Heads (French: Maison des T\u00eates).The city hall and the buildings surrounding the town square are by French architect Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Blondel, who was awarded the task of redesigning and modernizing the centre of Metz by the Royal Academy of Architecture in 1755 the context of the Enlightenment. Neoclassical buildings from the 18th century, such as the Opera House, the Intendant Palace (the present-day prefecture), and the Royal Governor's Palace (the present-day courthouse) built by Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau, are also found in the city.The Imperial District was built during the first annexation of Metz by the German Empire. In order to \"germanise\" the city, Emperor Wilhelm II decided to create a new district shaped by a distinctive blend of Germanic architecture, including Renaissance, neo-Romanesque and neo-Classical, mixed with elements of Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Alsatian and mock-Bavarian styles. Instead of Jaumont stone, commonly used everywhere else in the city, stone used in the Rhineland, such as pink and grey sandstone, granite and basalt were used. The district features noteworthy buildings including the rail station and the Central Post Office by German architect J\u00fcrgen Kr\u00f6ger.Modern architecture can also be seen in the town with works of French architects Roger-Henri Expert (Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-de-l'Enfant-J\u00e9sus church, 1934), Georges-Henri Pingusson (Fire Station, 1960), and Jean Dubuisson (subdivisions, 1960s). The refurbishment of the former Ney Arsenal as a Concert Hall in 1989 and the erection of the Metz Arena in 2002, by Spanish and French architects Ricardo Bofill and French Paul Chemetov represent the Postmodern movement.The Centre Pompidou-Metz museum in the Amphitheatre District represents a strong architectural initiative to mark the entrance of Metz into the 21st century. Designed by Japanese architect Shigeru Ban, the building is remarkable for the complex, innovative carpentry of its roof, and integrates concepts of sustainable architecture. The project encompasses the architecture of two recipients of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, Shigeru Ban (2014) and French Christian de Portzamparc (1994). The Amphitheatre District is also conceived by French architects Nicolas Michelin, Jean-Paul Viguier, and Jean-Michel Wilmotte and designer Philippe Starck. The urban project is expected to be completed by 2023. Further, a contemporary music venue designed by contextualist French architect Rudy Ricciotti stands in the Borny District.\n\n\n=== Urban ecology ===\n\nUnder the leadership of such people as botanist Jean-Marie Pelt, Metz pioneered a policy of urban ecology during the early 1970s. Because of the failure of post-war urban planning and housing estate development in Europe during the 1960s, mostly based on the concepts of CIAM, Jean-Marie Pelt, then municipal councillor of Metz, initiated a new approach to the urban environment.Based initially on the ideas of the Chicago School, Pelt's theories pleaded for better integration of humans into their environment and developed a concept centered on the relationship between \"stone and water\". His policy was realized in Metz by the establishment of extensive open areas surrounding the Moselle and the Seille rivers and the development of large pedestrian areas. As a result, Metz has over 37 m2 (400 sq ft) of open areas per inhabitant in the form of numerous public gardens in the city.The principles of urban ecology are still applied in Metz with the implementation of a local Agenda 21 action plan. The municipal ecological policy encompasses the sustainable refurbishment of ancient buildings, the erection of sustainable districts and buildings, green public transport, and the creation of public gardens by means of landscape architecture.Additionally, the city has developed its own combined heat and power station, using waste wood biomass from the surrounding forests as a renewable energy source. With a thermal efficiency above 80%, the 45MW boiler of the plant provides electricity and heat for 44,000 dwellings. The Metz power station is the first local producer and distributor of energy in France.\n\n\n=== Military architecture ===\n\nAs a historic Garrison town, Metz has been heavily influenced by military architecture throughout its history. From ancient history to the present, the city has been successively fortified and modified to accommodate the troops stationed there. Defensive walls from classical antiquity to the 20th century are still visible today, incorporated into the design of public gardens along the Moselle and Seille rivers. A medieval bridge castle from the 13th century, named Germans' Gate (French: Porte des Allemands), today converted into a convention and exhibition centre, has become one of the landmarks of the city. It is still possible to see parts of the 16th century citadel, as well as fortifications built in the 1740s by Louis de Cormontaigne but based on designs by Vauban. Important barracks, mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries, are spread around the city: some, which are of architectural interest, have been converted to civilian use, such as the Arsenal Concert Hall by Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill.\nThe extensive fortifications of Metz, which ring the city, include early examples of S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res system forts. Other forts were incorporated into the Maginot Line. A hiking trail on the Saint-Quentin plateau passes through a former military training zone and ends at the now abandoned military forts, providing a vantage point from which to survey the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAlthough the steel industry has historically dominated Moselle's economy, Metz's efforts at economic diversification have created a base in the sectors of commerce, tourism, information technology and the automotive industry. The city is the economic heart of the Lorraine region and around 73,000 people work daily within the urban agglomeration. The transport facilities found in the conurbation, including the international high-speed railway, motorway, inland connections and the local bus rapid transit system, have made the city a transport hub in the heart of the European Union. Metz is home to the biggest harbour handling cereals in France with over 4,000,000 tons/year.Metz is home to the Moselle Chamber of Commerce. International companies such as PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, ArcelorMittal, SFR, and TDF have established plants and centres in the Metz conurbation. Metz is also the regional headquarters of the Caisse d'Epargne and Banque Populaire banking groups.\nMetz is an important commercial centre of northern France with France's biggest retailer federation, consisting of around 2,000 retailers. Important retail companies are found in the city, such as the Galeries Lafayette, the Printemps department store and the Fnac entertainment retail chain. The historic city centre displays one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France and a mall, the Saint-Jacques centre. In addition there are several multiplex movie theatres and malls found in the urban agglomeration.\nIn recent years, Metz municipality have promoted an ambitious policy of tourism development, including urban revitalization and refurbishment of buildings and public squares. This policy has been spurred by the creation of the Centre Pompidou-Metz in 2010. Since its inauguration, the institution has become the most popular cultural venue in France outside Paris, with 550,000 visitors per year. Meanwhile, Saint-Stephen Cathedral is the most visited building in the city, accommodating 652,000 visitors per year.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums and exhibition halls ===\n\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz is a museum of modern and contemporary arts, the largest temporary exhibition area in France outside Paris.

The cathedral exhibits the collection of the Bishopric of Metz, including paraments and items used in the service of the Eucharist. Metz Cathedral is sometimes nicknamed the Good Lord's Lantern (French: la Lanterne du Bon Dieu), as it has the largest expanse of stained glass windows in the world: 6,500 m2 (70,000 sq ft). These include works by Gothic and Renaissance master glass makers Hermann von M\u00fcnster, Th\u00e9obald of Lixheim, and Valentin Bousch, romantic Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, tachist Roger Bissi\u00e8re, cubist Jacques Villon and modernist Marc Chagall.\nAnother of the city's churches displays a complete set of stained glass windows by French modernist Jean Cocteau.In addition, Metz features other museums and exhibition venues, such as:\n\nThe FRAC Lorraine, a public collection of contemporary art of the Lorraine region. It is located in the 12th-century Saint-Liver H\u00f4tel and organizes exhibitions of local and international contemporary artists.\nThe Golden Courtyard (French: la Cour d'Or), a museum dedicated to the history of Metz, divided into four sections (e.g. archeology, medieval, architecture, and fine arts). The Golden Courtyard displays a rich collection of Gallo-Roman and medieval finds and the remains of the Gallo-Roman baths of Divodurum Mediomatricum, revealed by the extension works to the museums in the 1930s.\nThe Museum of the 1870 War and of the Annexion in Gravelotte, a village located within the Metz-Metropole conurbation and the site of the Battle of Gravelotte, the only museum in Europe dedicated to the Franco-Prussian War. The museum exhibits military and everyday items from the period as well as artworks related to the 1870 war. A mausoleum erected in 1904 honoring the soldiers who died during the battle, the Memorial Hall (French: La Halle du Souvenir), has been included in the museum.\nThe House for Europe, located on the estate of Robert Schuman in Scy-Chazelles in the Metz-Metropole conurbation, transformed into a museum and convention centre.

The Solange Bertrand foundation, located in the artist's former house, conserves and displays her artworks. The municipal archives preserve and exhibit Metz's historical municipal records dating from medieval times to the present.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\nMetz has several venues for the performing arts. The Opera House of Metz, the oldest working opera house in France, features plays, dance, and lyric poetry. The Arsenal Concert Hall, dedicated to art music, is widely renowned for its excellent acoustics. The Trinitarians Club is a multi-media arts complex housed in the vaulted cellar and chapel of an ancient convent, the city's prime venue for jazz music. The Music Box (French: Boite \u00e0 Musique), familiarly known as BAM, is the concert venue dedicated to rock and electronic music. The Braun Hall and the Kolt\u00e8s Theater feature plays, and the city has two movie theaters specializing in Auteur cinema. The Saint-Jacques Square, surrounded by busy bars and pubs whose open-air tables fill the centre of the square.\nSince 2014, the former bus garage has been converted to accommodate over thirty artists in residence, in a space where they can create and rehearse artworks and even build set decorations. The artistic complex, called Metz Network of All Cultures (French: Toutes les Cultures en R\u00e9seau \u00e0 Metz) and familiarly known as TCRM-Blida, encompasses a large hall of 3,000 m2 (32,000 sq ft) while theater and dance companies benefit from a studio of 800 m2 (8,600 sq ft) with backstages.\n\n\n=== Metz in the arts ===\nMetz was an important cultural centre during the Carolingian Renaissance. For instance, Gregorian chant was created in Metz during the 8th century as a fusion of Gallican and ancient Roman repertory. Then called Messin Chant, it remains the oldest form of music still in use in Western Europe. The bishops of Metz, notably Saint-Chrodegang promoted its use for the Roman liturgy in Gallic lands under the favorable influence of the Carolingian monarchs. Messin chant made two major contributions to the body of chant: it fitted the chant into the ancient Greek octoechos system, and invented an innovative musical notation, using neumes to show the shape of a remembered melody. Metz was also an important centre of illumination of Carolingian manuscripts, producing such monuments of Carolingian book illumination as the Drogo Sacramentary.The Metz School (French: \u00c9cole de Metz) was an art movement in Metz and the region between 1834 and 1870, centred on Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal. The term was originally proposed in 1845 by the poet Charles Baudelaire, who appreciated the works of the artists. They were influenced by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix and inspired by the medieval heritage of Metz and its romantic surroundings. The Franco-Prussian War and the annexation of the territory by the Germans resulted in the dismantling of the movement. The main figures of the Metz School were Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, Auguste Migette, Auguste Hussenot, Louis-Th\u00e9odore Devilly, Christopher Fratin, and Charles P\u00eatre. Their works include paintings, engravings, drawings, stained-glass windows, and sculptures.\nA festival named \"passages\" takes place in May. Numerous shows are presented to it.\n\n\n=== The Graoully dragon as symbol of the city ===\n\nThe Graoully is depicted as a fearsome dragon, vanquished by the sacred powers of Saint Clement of Metz, the first Bishop of the city. The Graoully quickly became a symbol of Metz and can be seen in numerous insignia of the city, from the 10th century on. Writers from Metz tend to present the legend as an allegory of Christianity's victory over paganism, represented by the harmful dragon.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nLocal specialties include the quiche, the pot\u00e9e, the Lorrain p\u00e2t\u00e9, and also suckling pig. Different recipes, such as jam, tart, charcuterie and fruit brandy, are made from the Mirabelle and Damson plums. Also, Metz is the cradle of some pastries like the Metz cheese pie and the Metz Balls (French: boulet de Metz), a ganache-stuffed biscuit coated with marzipan, caramel, and dark chocolate. Local beverages include Moselle wine and Amos beer.The Covered Market of Metz is one of the oldest, most grandiose in France and is home to traditional local food producers and retailers. Originally built as the bishop's palace, the French Revolution broke out before the Bishop of Metz could move in and the citizens decided to turn it into a food market. The adjacent Chamber's Square (French: Place de la Chambre) is surrounded by numerous local food restaurants.\n\n\n=== Celebrations and events ===\nMany events are celebrated in Metz throughout the year. The city of Metz dedicates two weeks to the Mirabelle plum during the popular Mirabelle Festival held in August. During the festival, in addition to open markets selling fresh plums, mirabelle tarts, and mirabelle liquor, there are live music, fireworks, parties, art exhibits, a parade with floral floats, a competition, the crowning of the Mirabelle Queen and a gala of celebration.A literature festival is held in June.

Along with this expansion, several graduate schools took the opportunity to establish campuses in the park. At first, facilities were grouped around the lake Symphony, like Sup\u00e9lec in 1985 and Georgia Tech Lorraine in 1990. In 1996, the engineering school Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech (ENSAM) built a research and learning center next to the golf course. This opened the way to the development of a new area, where the Franco-German university (ISFATES) and the ENIM moved in 2010. These graduate schools often cooperate with the University of Lorraine. For instance, the university and ENSAM share research teams, laboratories, equipments, and doctoral programs.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\nPublic transport includes a bus rapid transit system, called Mettis.

      "name": "Fort de Guentrange",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Fort de Guentrange dominates Thionville in the Moselle department of France. It was built by Germany next to the town of the same name in the late 19th century after the annexation of the Moselle following the Franco-Prussian War.  The Fort de Guentrange was part of the Moselstellung, a group of eleven fortresses surrounding Thionville and Metz to guard against the possibility of a French attack aimed at regaining Alsace and Lorraine, with construction taking place between 1899 and 1906. The fortification system incorporated new principles of defensive construction to deal with advances in artillery. Later forts, such as Guentrange, embodied innovative design concepts such as dispersal and concealment. The later forts were designed to support offensive operations, as an anchor for a pivoting move by German forces into France.\nThe Feste Ober-Gentringen, as Fort de Guentrange was called by the Germans, with the Fort de Koenigsmacker and Fort d'Illange, assured the protection of Thionville against French attack. Positioned to the rear of the principal lines of combat in the First World War, the fort never saw combat in World War I. It is the largest of the three Thionville festen. The site overlooks the Moselle valley and its western approaches, as well as the railway lines to the west of Thionville.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Fort de Guentrange is located about 4 kilometers (2.5 mi) to the northwest of Thionville on a hilltop overlooking the town and the northern railway line. It was defended by a garrison of 2000 men. Like the Fort de Plappeville on the heights of Metz, Fort Ober-Gentringen features two dispersed armored batteries, each armed with four short 100mm guns in single turrets. It possesses a separate four-level barracks and about 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) of underground galleries. The austere simplicity of the fort's fa\u00e7ade is characteristic of the forts of the era.\nThe dispersed, un-walled nature of the later Moselstellung was a significant innovation.  Compared to the French S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res system forts of the same era, later German fortifications such as Guentrange were scattered over a large area and enclosed chiefly by barbed wire. While certain individual elements presented imposing walls to an attacker, these walls were not continuous.  The dispersed nature is evidenced by the official French name: the Groupe Fortifi\u00e9 de Guentrange (Fortified Group of Guentrange). These arrangements were studied and improved upon by the French in the construction of the Maginot Line.The fort includes three separate fortified barracks along a north\u2013south line, the central barracks being the largest. Each barracks was built into a hillside so that the rear are shielded by earth, while the top and front are protected by three of four meters of concrete, and are surmounted by a parapet.  The two batteries are similarly constructed and linked to the barracks by tunnels. The four 100mm guns in each battery were protected by Schumann turrets and controlled by an armored observation cupola on top of each battery. The whole was surrounded by deep networks of barbed wire, which were swept by fire from small perimeter blockhouses, also linked via the tunnel system. Further counterscarp casemates were built after 1912 when the defensive perimeter was expanded. The interior of the position was equipped with trenches for infantry. The barracks and batteries were further armored with reinforced concrete and armored windows. A variety of blockhouses and infantry shelters were also built in the intervals between forts. The fort featured central heating in the barracks and the armored batteries, as well as a central generating plant for electricity with eight diesel generators.\n\n\n== Operational concept ==\nFrom 1899, the Germans viewed Metz as a secure position that could provide an anchor for a pivoting movement into France from the Low Countries. This strategy, which would become known as the Schlieffen Plan, required that the Moselstellung deter an advance by French forces into Lorraine while the German forces mobilized.\n\n\n== History ==\nDuring World War I, Thionville was located well to the rear of German lines and never came under attack. With the Compi\u00e8gne armistice of 1918, Lorraine was returned to France and the fort became French property. The three Thionville forts became known as the Fortified Group of Thionville.\n\nSee Fortified Sector of Thionville for a broader discussion of the Thionville sector of the Maginot Line.The Fort de Guetrange was integrated into the Fortified Sector of Thionville of the Maginot Line in the 1930s, backing up the newer Maginot ouvrages that were built about halfway between Thionville and the border with Luxembourg.  The short 105mm guns were replaced by 105mm long guns removed from the German fortifications of Metz. The artillery range was thus increased from 9,700 meters (6.0 mi) to 12,700 meters (7.9 mi). During the Battle of France the Thionville area was bypassed and encircled by German forces, with the Maginot and earlier fortifications seeing little action. After the 25 June 1940 armistice the German occupiers used the fort as a supply depot until Thionville was liberated by the Americans. The Fort de Guentrange was captured without resistance by elements of the U.S. 90th Infantry Division on 12 September 1944, after the German forces withdrew to Metz. After the war, the French Army used the fort as a munitions depot until 1971.\n\n\n== Manning ==\nUnder the Germans, the Feste Obergentringen was occupied in 1909-10 by the 8th Fussartillerie (Foot Artillery) Regiment. From 1913, the garrison was provided by the 16th Fussartillerie. The French garrison of the Fort de Guentrange in 1939-40 was provided by detachments of the 168th Fortress Infantry Regiment and the 151st Position Artillery Regiment.\n\n\n== Present status ==\nThe fort is the property of the city of Thionville and is maintained by the Amicale du Groupe Fortifi\u00e9 de Guentrange, which conducts guided visits.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nThis article incorporates text translated from the corresponding French Wikipedia article as of March 2, 2010.\nKauffmann, J.E., Kaufmann, H.W., Jancovi\u010d-Poto\u010dnik, A. and Lang, P.

        "wiki": "James Bond is a fictional character created by the novelist Ian Fleming in 1953. Bond is a British secret agent working for MI6 who also answers to his codename, 007. He has been portrayed on film by the actors Sean Connery, David Niven, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, and Daniel Craig, in twenty-seven productions. All the films but two were made by Eon Productions. Eon now holds the full adaptation rights to all of Fleming's Bond novels.In 1961 the producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman joined forces to purchase the filming rights to Fleming's novels. They founded the production company Eon Productions and, with financial backing by United Artists, began working on Dr. No, which was directed by Terence Young and featured Connery as Bond. Following Dr. No's release in 1962, Broccoli and Saltzman created the holding company Danjaq to ensure future productions in the James Bond film series. The series currently encompasses twenty-four films, with the most recent, Spectre, released in October 2015. With a combined gross of nearly $7 billion to date, the films produced by Eon constitute the fourth-highest-grossing film series, behind the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Star Wars and Wizarding World films. Accounting for the effects of inflation, the Bond films have amassed over $14 billion at current prices. The films have won five Academy Awards: for Sound Effects (now Sound Editing) in Goldfinger (at the 37th Awards), to John Stears for Visual Effects in Thunderball (at the 38th Awards), to Per Hallberg and Karen Baker Landers for Sound Editing, to Adele and Paul Epworth for Original Song in Skyfall (at the 85th Awards), and to Sam Smith and Jimmy Napes for Original Song in Spectre (at the 88th Awards). Additionally, several of the songs produced for the films have been nominated for Academy Awards for Original Song, including Paul McCartney's \"Live and Let Die\", Carly Simon's \"Nobody Does It Better\" and Sheena Easton's \"For Your Eyes Only\". In 1982 Albert R. Broccoli received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award.When Broccoli and Saltzman bought the rights to existing and future Fleming titles, it did not include Casino Royale, which had already been sold to producer Gregory Ratoff, with the story having been adapted for television in 1954. After Ratoff's death, the rights were passed on to Charles K. Feldman, who subsequently produced the satirical Bond spoof Casino Royale in 1967. A legal case ensured that the film rights to the novel Thunderball were held by Kevin McClory as he, Fleming and the scriptwriter Jack Whittingham had written a film script upon which the novel was based. Although Eon Productions and McClory joined forces to produce Thunderball, McClory still retained the rights to the story and adapted Thunderball into 1983's Never Say Never Again. The current distribution rights to both of those films are held by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, the studio which distributes Eon's regular series.\n\n\n== Eon films ==\nThe Eon-produced films have a combined gross of nearly $7 billion, and constitute the sixth-highest-grossing film series.\n\n\n=== Dr. No (1962) ===\n\nStrangways, the British Intelligence (SIS) Station Chief in Jamaica, is killed.

          "It is one of the most nice areas of Luxembourg. Visited several times during my stay in this country The buildings have been well maintained during all thse years",
          "Nice fairy tale about Melousina from the tour guide. But apart from that they are some holes in the rock ... nothing more. But very well presented.",
          "The Bock Casemates are a really unique attraction that most cities can't replicate, and I think it's essential to see in the city. It's a really fun cave-ish experience with a lot of history behind it, and you get stunning views of the city from multiple angles while you're",
          "This was a great way to spend a couple of hours. Great for all ages. There are some steep steps in some areas but none that need to be taken. My 82 year old mother thoroughly enjoyed herself. There were children in there having a great time too. Very interesting.",
          "Only takes 20 minutes or so but worth it. The signs are in French and German so we couldn't read much about the history",
          "Lots of walking up and down narrow stone steps. Inexpensive to get in but you pay the price in body aches w/all that walking. Best to just enjoy the free viewing from the top and save all the leg pains to follow!",
          "This was one of my favorite attractions in Luxembourg City. When you go down into the tunnels, it feels like you are in a cave. The walls are all stone, the floor are mostly uneven, and at times the passage ways can be really narrow. There are some windows you can see outside of",
          "Really interesting place to visit, I liked the \"weather\" there inside, was really cool. And feels so good in summer",
          "Visited the Casemates in Luxemburg on a rainy day. Interesting with lots of tunnels and caves, lighting is average so if your not sure about your footings be careful! The floors are very uneven. Could have done with a bit more explanation about what was what. The spiral",
          "Wao! This place is beautiful, if you are an history buff. We love the intricate nature of the place and it awesome.",
          "We took a guided tour through the Casemates. You can also do a self guided tour. The fortification itself is amazing and on the tour through you are given a sense of the role these fortifications played in Luxembourg City's history. The views afforded along the way are well",
          "The catacombs are fascinating from a historical and geological perspective. I would recommend paying extra for the guided tour as we found ourselves a little unsure of what we were really seeing. The brochure provides very little information. The catacombs are quite dark and be",
          "Visited here whilst in Luxembourg for a day whilst travelling around Europe for a week with a friend. We were both students so we\u2019re both very happy to find out that they had student price, especially as Luxembourg is so expensive and we were on a tight budget. We only paid \u20ac6",
          "Only \u20ac7 for entry, casemates offers an expanse of tunnels and underground hideouts used for soldiers, cannons and dungeons!",
          "I went for the 11am tour, the guide spoke both enlgish and german and did a fantastic job showing us around. She did a great job switching between the two languages for everyone making it move quite smoothly. The casemates were extremely interesting, the highlight was the spiral",
          "We loved this experience (both culturally and the views you get of the city). Incredible underground tunnels and you even see some of the castle\u2019s remains from before the 10th century. Only recommendation: don\u2019t take stroller because it is very complicated to move and we saw no",
          "\u20ac7 for adults, really cool tunnels leading to dead ends or other tunnels, to balconies overlooking each side of the wall or leading to little rooms. So much fun!",
          "It\u2019s worth the \u20ac7, we had fun wandering around. Not suitable for the infirm. An interesting piece of history, and a bit of excitement with a few spooky tunnels. Good views.",
          "Apart from the stunning views, it was really interesting to see the military defense strategies of the castle-fort. And it was incredible to see how they were able to dig and carve in the rock such big trenches so long ago.",
          "Great fun to explore the tunnels and caves and learn more about the history of Luxembourg. Parts of the caves can be a bit narrow and it\u2019s up and down quite a lot.",
          "We spent very little time here but would to have liked to walk around the area some more. Great on the history from our guide. Need a guide to walk around the old quarter and learn so much.",
          "The Casemates are worth exploring but can be a bit underwhelming. The tunnels are interesting and the narrow spiral steps down are challenging. It is fascinating to believe that thousands of soldiers lived inside even though there are fewer tunnels remaining today. There is not",
          "It is nice to see history of Luxembourg yet it is only caves that was used in the old days. I am thinking of the caves and the graphics in the Cappadocia. This is not even close. But if you are in town you can spend an hour at most for photo taking in the low illimunated alleys.",
          "Definitely worth a visit! Came across this area and was blown away with the beauty of the area and the history behind it",
          "This site was along circular walk, only site that charged a fee for entry (7E). We paid and toured this site. Was a great choice! We thought it was very interesting and really enjoyed touring the old fortress with all its rooms, awesome views and cannons for protection. There",
          "Cool experience but would not recommend for older visitors who have trouble balancing or climbing stairs. The stairwell going down towards the exit gets steep and narrow towards the end and may pose a safety hazard for them.",
          "The casemates are interesting and worth a visit. Note that you have to have cash, they do not accept card. The signage could be better, we got lost a couple of times and followed some other people down some dead ends. It\u2019s quite dark and the floor is uneven. The views of",
          "A good hour should be spent here. Unfortunately there is little info provided about it and none provided in any languages other than German and French which isn\u2019t great for a tourist destination. Luxembourg doesn\u2019t seem to quite recognise this as a potentially large tourist",
          "Free with Lux Card. Easy to walk to if staying in central hotels. There are some nice views from there and some canons to take photos of. Watch out for the v steep and badly lit stairs. Try and avoid having a big bag with you.",
          "So there isn't much information about or anyone to talk to, but you can get a small info leaflet when you get your tickets, 7 euro each. It's not necessarily easy to find but we thoroughly enjoyed our visit. Great place to get photos of the city as well. Take your time, there's",
          "This is a must visit when in Luxembourg, as it is something that makes the city quite unique. So much history has passed within these natural walls. Very interesting.",
          "Just some caves. Was nice, but not a must. Was a lot of spiderweb there so watch out. Beutiful view from some areas.",
          "Went here to see if i could get some cool photos, and too se alot of Luxembourg city. It\u2019s definatly worth checking out but it\u2019s not a wow factor, you get to see the views outside there as well! But it\u2019s a cool way to see Luxembourg and its brick arctitecture. A ticket costs 7",
          "If you really want to get into the bowels of this city and explore its history, this is a good way to do it. As a bonus, you\u2019ll get some great views!",
          "Long queue to get in with only one ticket desk. Quite interesting about the history and some great views over the old city, but after a time it did become a little boring without sufficient variety in what we were experiencing. Not expensive to visit (\u20ac6 for seniors) and no",
          "It was interesting to explore the place - I went there with my friends and, in order to make the visit more fun, we imagined that we are knights ourselves and made different scenarios of action while walking/ running around! P.S. You should definitely bring cash when visiting",
          "The biggest issue with experiencing the Casemates du Bock is simply trying to find parking. We didn't plan well and just arrived in Luxembourg City without determining where to park to visit Casemates du Bock. After looking online we realized that parking was a common issue",
          "If you have been to one of this somewhere, you would be too existed about it. It is amazing and full of history, yet it's not really that fun to walk around. I did get a bit bored half way through it. Its locate in the city centre, so if you have time you may go and see it,",
          "Interesting to visit and only \u20ac6 for students! We were super tired though and kept getting lost or climbing stairs to find a dead end. We only stayed 20 minutes but I\u2019m sure if you explore a little longer you\u2019ll find it a bit more exciting- would probably recommend a guided",
          "There was a time when Luxembourg was a heavily defended city, a stronghold that was very difficult to conquer the Casemates du Bock a vestiges of those times - nowadays a tourist attraction.(like the Casemates of Petrusse - those were closed when we were in Luxembourg). So here",
          "These are elevated historic \u201ccaves\u201d in a mountain side overlooking the old town. They were built into the mountain side to help defend the city. Nice views but not much more.",
          "It's worth it to check out while in Luxembourg. You can take a nice view or landscape from the top - ground level (I haven't seen the underground part of the place).",
          "I didn't need a tour but definitely needed to be able-bodied in parts. The views were spectacular and the way the rocks were honey-combed with the vaults beneath the fortress was incredibly clever for the times.",
          "I consider this a Must See in Luxembourg. I don\u2019t know why I never heard of them before, they\u2019re an astounding feat of nature and engineering and hard work. You must be able-bodied to enjoy the Casemates. There are lots of uneven surfaces, stairs and some crouching.",
          "We were not sure that we needed the tour but we\u2019re glad that we took it. The lady was wonderful and really brought the system to life. She was very knowledgeable and personable and added greatly to our enjoyment of Luxembourg.",
          "This was a unique experience, very interesting history, wonderful views And it was lovely & cool inside on a warm day.",
          "The casemates themselves are interesting, the views that open up are very nice. The student price is \u20ac6 and I think the regular entry costs \u20ac7.50 and I think that\u2019s quite a lot for what you get to see.",
          "Maybe it\u2019s because I was tired from our 22km hike the previous day but I didn\u2019t enjoy the casemates. There is no information inside and it\u2019s very same-y. There are nice views from the openings but you can see those without going into the casemates.",
          "I was very disappointed with my visit to the Casemates du Bock. There was very little to read. One room looked like another. It would have been much more interesting if there were signs to read and a tour that explained what you were looking at.",
          "Essentially just a network of tunnels through the rock. It is quite cool and some of the view points aren't bad but in my opinion they could do much more with it in terms of the information and history surrounding it, which would have made it much more interesting",
          "Good way to spend an hour. Don\u2019t expect anything too exciting as it is a lot of the same but it is still interesting to walk around and explore a place with so much history and at 7 eur isn\u2019t too expensive.",
          "My husband and I went here while in Luxembourg and had a great time exploring this tunnel system that was used to hide people during World War II. It also gives great views of Luxembourg. It's not the most handicapped friendly as it's dark and features a lot of dangerous steps.",
          "Just caves, you don\u2019t know where to go, they doesn\u2019t explain you anything at the entrance. The balcony isn\u2019t by far, the most beautiful in Europe... come on!",
          "If you have time you can do this ,nothing special. It's better to do it with a guide,or if you have time you can just walk if like walking.",
          "So basically these are tunnels inside a rock. Full stop. Nothing else. Oh yes, there are a couple of canons. Entry is 7 euro pp (cash only) for a short walk through the tunnels that have no description at all. Not much to see except the tunnels in the rock. Nothing else, no",
          "You really don't see much more going in that you do in the pictures shown here. It is just more of the same.",
          "Bought a Luxembourg day pass and got complimentary access into the place, therefore i have no idea what the ticket price is. This place is like a collection of caves and it's cold even during spring time. Beautiful view from the viewing platforms! Absolutely worth running around",
          "Les casemattes is a thrilling location, just imagine soldiers being under siege in that dark, cold, and damp location! Good opportunity for photo shots of Luxembourg's Clausen and Grund quarters from the ramparts. Unfortunately missing the opportunity to providing any",
          "...but essential partof Luxembourg's history and good that they still remain. Much of the defensive city was removed a couple of hundred years ago.",
          "Interesting place to visit. Located in the underground .. several tunnels with different beautiful views...",
          "It was a lot of fun exploring the tunnels and peeking out over the valley. Casemates du Bock are a bit of a maze and the maps and signage weren't the most user friendly. However, it making it more interesting to explore. Recommend.",
          "Something that must be done in Luxembourg city. It is a good time spent walking around and looking out the viewpoints.",
          "Really cool area to walk around and explore. Lot's of history to indulge and stuff to learn. A good visit for bad weather days as well. Over a 1000 year of history and interesting to see the different use of the Bock in that time. We were here on a Monday morning and got lucky",
          "The Casemates were such a mystery! The caves hold a lot of history from medieval times to World War II. It was fun to climb around and explore.",
          "This is a really cool area to walk around. You can get a beautiful view of the city and walk around very old \u2018ruins\u2019 in the city. It was a lot of run to hike around the different parts of it.",
          "Worth dropping into see it. Wear comfortable shoes as it\u2019s uneven surface great views from both sides.",
          "It doesn\u2019t take much more than 30 mins to see but it is interesting seeing the ancient tunnels carved into the rock. Not so dissimilar to the tunnels of Gibraltar.",
          "This UNESCO World Heritage site is truly steeped in history; it is worth reading a brief summary before going (if you are interested in that sort of thing). It has received many famous visitors in its centuries of existence, including Napoleon and Goethe. We had a great time",
          "A sight to see well worth a visit loved walking round here so relaxing the rain and wind didn't deter us",
          "That's one of those places that makes you feel enchanted and frightened at the same time. If you're anything like me, you start wondering what kind of things happend there at the time and lots of different scenarios go through your head. It's very very worthy visiting. It takes",
          "Be aware the place is closed for long periods. My kids were very disappointed. Open in Spring?! There needs to be proper opening times posted online.",
          "These are so well preserved and there are rooms everywhere. There\u2019s also a few points that have tons of small and narrow stairs. If you dont like small spaces it will have difficulty with the stairs, skip them. There\u2019s so much more to see. We got some great pics overlooking the",
          "There is a fee and a senior discount. It is a maze of tunnels and small cavities, wear good shoes as it is uneven walking. Many of th things Niels lead to dead ends . You can\u2019t get lost but can end up backtracking. I would say no more than an hour would be sufficient to see all",
          "Absolutely a must do experience when in Luxembourg City. My assistant and I had our last day in the country scheduled for sightseeing before hopping on a flight later that night to head back to the states. We spent the whole day walking through every district of this",
          "I would recommend you go here... Beautiful sites of the old centre of Luxembourg. Its a lovely walk, but be aware some parts are not open on the weekend.",
          "Interesting to begin with but then got a bit repetitive and not very well navigated or explained even with the map/handout. I would recommend a visit due to the history of the city but does not need a long time spent there",
          "Allow a couple of hours to walk through the casemates, learn about their importance, history, and take some great photos from openings. At its height of operation, 35,000 people could be protected in this 23 km long cavern. Cannons fired from openings down the gorge could",
          "Try do the tour with the guide and you'll learn more about the place. Love to see the view from here.",
          "From Fortification built by Count Siegfried in 10th century become a tourist attraction, long story and history, attacked, rebuilt, and occupied by different armies after wars and wars to conqueror this stronghold, and then for the neutrality of Luxembourg the fort was destroyed",
          "You may think they\u2019re just some ruins but once you\u2019re there it is a great experience. It is a bit of a maze but the views are great",
          "Casemates du Bock has historical stories behind but currently it is going to convert into parking lots instead It overlooks the river Alzette and the structures below. The ruinsof he Lutzelburg fortress offer great views of the old city befre one explores passageways cut 130",
          "If you have some time over this valey has nice walking path in the valey of Alzette. From Casemates du Bock there is a gorgeous out-look over the valey and the Chirch Saint-Jean-du-Grund on the oposite side. Unfortunately Casemates du Bock has turned into a parking lot that",
          "We found these interesting, but confusing. Provided literature in English had limited information. Numbered signage difficult to find/see, therefore, nearly impossible to know where to turn. Perhaps better directional signage or a guide within the castmates would help visitors",
          "We found about the Casemates while we were in Luxembourg. They are a fascinating network of tunnels that have been part of the fortifications since I believe the 1600\u2019s. They are worth visiting to see what fortifications looked like so long ago, how they figured in the defence",
          "The Casemates du Bock are an essential tourist attraction in Luxembourg City. There are great viewpoints from the Casemates over the city. Aim to spend between 45 and 60 minutes here. Entrance is priced at 6\u20ac, or at no cost for holders of the Luxembourg Card.",
          "Historic well maintained bridge just outside the city centre, it is a UNESCO World Heritage site, also close to the old town",
          "Ultimately its the centre of old Luxembourg, the city that has survived the many attacks over ten centuries and lives on as a unesco world heritage site. Full of history, old buildings and interest. A must to visit.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the city of Luxembourgh and this is one of the highlights.It was a warm sunny day and the trees were in their autumn splendour.The view is magnificent.",
          "Casemates have different areas hat the guide divide in letters and try to be sure to visit them in order. Some of these caves are dead ends to the same or very similar views. Then, there are some hidden areas that go up or down stairs to new areas and if you cannot handle close",
          "We spent about 90 minutes here on a Sunday afternoon. There was no information in English once we were through the turnstile so make sure that when you buy your ticket (\u20ac6), you ask for the free brochure that provides at least some basic information and a map. I suggest you read",
          "Even though there isn't much to do inside, it is worth it paying the fee to check the caves. Not only because of what is inside, but also because of the views you can get from the city.",
          "It is interesting to see the casemates but if you dont go you will not be missing much. It is dark in some places and if you are claustrophobic I dont recommend it.",
          "This was such a fun walk through a maze of caves. Be sure to really explore each of the different areas; while some of them are dead ends to the same or very similar views, there are some hidden areas that go up or down stairs to new areas. That being said, some of the stairs",
          "The Bock Casemates are definitely worth the 6 - Adult or 5- Student \u20ac entry fee. It is definitely a neat experience walking inside all of the caves. Definitely a must-do for a short visit in Luxembourg.",
          "100% worth a visit! Beautiful caverns carved into the valley. Many beautiful view points to check out as as well!",
          "To get the best out of the visit you definitely should take a guided tour. But the problem is that it is not possible to prebook the tour, you just need to come here during the times that can be found on the official website, and hope that you get a place. All the information is",
          "The Casemates require a lot of walking on a not-so-straight surface so be sure to wear very comfortable shoes. Also in some parts they get narrow so I would advise people who are claustrophobic not to visit these sections. Other than that, I think it is a place worth visiting.",
          "Definitely one of the things to do whilst in Luxembourg. It is something you should not give. They give you such an insight on the past history of the country",
          "Another recommendation from the hotel and something I missed on a past trip to Luxembourg. You can spent an hour walking around the caves in the city and wall and can take some very cramped spiral staircases which are nice. The caves have plenty of light since they have open",
          "The history of Luxembourg is here, the statue of a golden lady and the park with Luxembourg flags. Nice and fantastic view. Nice city walk will tell the tourist the history of Luxembourg. Must visit.",
          "It was used as a army base, castle and jail. The cavern oozes history. The views of the GRund, the river, the abbey and the viaduct is also great.",
          "Totally worth the money. Not to crowded with a nice view around the city. You can easily walk around for about 60 minutes.",
          "From here, you get plenty of excellent views of the beautiful city, It is interesting to explore the old fortress and to suck in the atmosphere. A great getaway in the middle of a busy city. A great place to start a day of exploring Luxemburg.",
          "we had a quick visit to Luxembourg city so this was the most famous place in the city which must be seen ,the view was great to walk and see the historic signature but my advice to not ride the tour train it was poring specially if you have children thy get bored and thy don't",
          "We went here only to be told its cash only so had to walk back up a massive hill to find a cash point, they really need to inform you this before you go! But for \u00a36 it was a decent time spend.",
          "This was recommended by our hotel landlady, and quite interesting to find out the history and use of the city walls. There were a couple of areas that were dead ends, not specifically signposted until you got to a closed door, but not insurmountable. Sturdy shoes essential due",
          "My wife and I were walking around the City. We were really looking forward to seeing Casemates du Bock. We were not disappointed. It was amazing. All the different portals that allowed us to see out on both sides were very cool. We absolutely loved it!",
          "We toured this site after reading some of it\u2019s history and quite a history is has. It goes back to 963 and Count Siegfried and the castle Lucilinburhuc (which gave Luxembourg it\u2019s name). Subsequent fortifications were built on this site over the centuries. We paid 16\u20ac (5\u20ac",
          "It's beautiful here, we didn't really understand the history much but lovely to wander around and great views!",
          "This was not high on my list of things to see but I was nearby and had free entry with the Luxembourg Card. It was pretty cool to walk around the tunnels and look outside just as so many people have done for hundreds of years. Lots of steps and uneven walking, as could be",
          "We went early on a Sunday and got there right at opening time (10am). We had the place to ourselves which was wonderful as we could really see everything and admire the views without the crowds. Highly recommend adding this to your tour list of Luxembourg.",
          "A grear part of the city to get an understanding of the history of Luxembourg and to get fantastic views across the city. Takes a while to explore all the caverns and passages and a little more information in the boards would have been helpful but overall, a good place to visit",
          "This is a great place you need to visit in Luxembourg, especially in summer, you can hide here for a little bit from the heat outside. Great city views on the lower City and Alzette river. Price to enter: 7 euros, adult",
          "An underground set of cave to be explored. Great way to experience the past and what occurred in the time when this was actually a defensive position during the wars. Easy to find and entry price was not too much for what you saw.",
          "This is the place that you can see the history of Luxembourg City. It has also very charming view of old city Grund and new city Kirchberg. Do not forgot to go on top of the small tower and take pictures of Red bridge. You can also listen the speech of Robert Schumann (one of",
          "The fort that once stood on the rockes is largely gone as it was demolished long ago, but underneath the rock there are many corridors with openings to the outside, which give the casemates a clear view of large parts of the gorge. If you enjoy a more claustrophobic experience,",
          "A trip into 18th and 19th century underground fortifications. At various points you have views over the town. The main quibble is that the information boards are not in English, so it was a real struggle to pick out the meaning with grade 5 O level French. There are English",
          "Highly recommended to take the guided tour as it gives you plenty of background and history of not only the casemates but Luxembourg city as well!",
          "Unesco certified this place is one of the main attractions of Luxembourg. It really represents what this city is all about and that these fortifications kept Luxembourg pure and free.",
          "This part of Luxembourg is a must.The Bock is built into and carved into the rock cliffs were the past residents lived. It's not a huge area but is still thankfully preserved. The city of Luxembourg has it's own unique layout and has a real quirky kind of charm to it.The Bock",
          "Do take the guided tour as the history if a key feature in this place. Our English guide told the story of this place in a very interesting and clear way.",
          "I did the one hour guided tour in English and the guide was very good. I don't think I would have gotten as much out of it on my own because there aren't a lot of explanations.",
          "We explored the Casemates during our half-day in Luxembourg City. It was nice to see this piece of history. In 1,5 - 2 hours it will give you a good impression.",
          "As a Roman ruin, you must take some time to explore this place if you are going to stay in Luxembourg City. It is a must go and will have some tourists if it is at a peak time.",
          "The paths are surprisingly poorly marked, so you can get lost and end up walking up and down lots of stairs and finding lots of dead ends. Not much is labelled, as you're really mainly just walking through tunnels. If this doesn't sound like your thing, don't bother - but",
          "This is an interesting site, the underground tunnels give a real insight into how the city was defended for so long. The fact that the network of tunnels stretch for 17km around the city means they must be under most of the city. The views out to both sides over the valley",
          "100 % sure to don't skip this attraction. Worth it to walk up and down. Very nice view from up specially when weather is sunny. Very interesting how they built this city :)",
          "There was an entrance fee which was unnecessary as I felt there wasn't much upkeep needed. But worth a look around none the less.",
          "Excellent way to spend a couple of hours and at 6 euros per adult good value. Leaflet available in different languages and useful explaining the history.",
          "Recommended after visiting the tourist information office in the centre. Worth the 10 minute walk from the tourist information and stopped at the palace to take a look on the way",
          "Not easy to find the entrance and maybe overpriced but still worth a visit. It has an interesting history and what is left would have been demolished but for the fact a lot of the city would have been destroyed as well. There are good views from the gun 'ports' and enjoyed",
          "My cousin and I visited Luxembourg City for 1 day and the Casemates du Bock were on our list of what to see. We were not disappointed. We enjoyed this historic site and the views into the old central section of the city were lovely. Be prepared to walk and do some steps when",
          "This is a special attraction because of the historic importance, but is quite disappointing. It was recognized as UNESCO world heritage site.was built first in 1644 and are 23 km long . Actually this is an underground fortress used to defend Luxembourg from the enemies from",
          "It costs 6 euros to enter. You seem to be able to see if from all over but it is difficult to find the entrance. Head for the flags above it and go down the steps inside. It is interesting to look around but also dark and there are many stairs. The staircases are uneven and",
          "THE rock Luxembourg is build on, lots of history which made our day - thanks to our local guide Karin Stephano !!! She knows all about Luxembourg also about the vanlife people from Pataschas world.",
          "This place must visit when you are in Luxembourg , old place with historical events , nice scenery ; you can take a lot of photos over there",
          "Picturesque, this venue is a must visit when in Luxembourg. Take a stroll al around and enjoy the scenery which seems to belong to a fairytale! Equally nice to visit when the sun is down!",
          "Amazing to think of all the people that survived because of these tunnels. take a map before exploring, we didnt!",
          "Worth a visit. The view is amazing. It\u2019s an old castle that was isolated on a rock in the middle of a valley. After the visit head into the lower town for lunch!",
          "From Casemates is nice view. 6\u20ac the tickets,I think not bad,but everywhere stairs and stones, nothing special...",
          "This is a very cool stop in your trip to Lux. You can see the city from some scenic angles. There are lots of little crevices that offer a cool perspective. The ticket is 6 euros and is well worth the price. Just know you will be up and down a lot of stairs during your visit!!!!",
          "Not much to see and do besides hiding from the sun. Do not take the tour, you won t learn much. Pay 6 euros, grab a brochure and go",
          "Taking the tour is a must. Very high quality guide. The casemates themselves are amazing. A must visit!",
          "Very difficult to navigate - the signs aren\u2019t in English so if you\u2019re really interested in this then maybe do a tour. It\u2019s \u20ac6 each and its a nice thing to do . It\u2019s got a nice view outside on top of the hill of the city",
          "The views you get from the casemates are not really any better than those you get from up above so to make your tour worthwhile you should tag on to a guide who will tell you a little of the interesting history of Luxembourg and its casemate.",
          "Make sure you wear trainers or good walking shoes as floor and steps very uneven and in places it\u2019s very dark. Lots of narrow staircases and corridors which lead to nowhere which gets a little frustrating. Some nice views of the city. Beware if you suffer from claustrophobia as",
          "The best thing about the Casemates on a scorching hot day is that they\u2019re refreshingly cool inside! That isn\u2019t to say they aren\u2019t worth seeing otherwise, because they absolutely are, although in all honesty, you\u2019d struggle to spend the hour or two here some guides suggest. They",
          "The views of this area are stunning and include the Grund. This is a perfect photo opportunity so get your cameras ready. An old part of history this is a can't miss area.",
          "Whatever else you miss, don\u2019t skip this one, it\u2019s a great fortification and the views of the Grund and of haute Ville are stunning! Take a flashlight though",
          "We really enjoyed wandering this rather odd remnant of Luxembourg's old defenses. There is quite a lot of history displayed around. There are a lot of odd passages and stairways, some leading nowhere, that can get a bit scary, hard to walk up/down, definitely not for mobility",
          "Do take the tour as you will know more of the history of this place The tour guide gave a fascinating history and legends of the city.",
          "This was our first visit of our trip to Luxembourg, & we really enjoyed it. If you are interested in the history of Luxembourg itself, you cannot not do this one! Those who are physically challenged when walking should be advised this could be a struggle. Enquire first.",
          "A great experience, a bit claustrophobic but I think that\u2019s the point of the tour! Not expensive and we can finish in a grass park near the river. Go there and see for yourself s",
          "Amazing ruins of the wall around the city. Not difficult to navigate even for seniors. This is a must see in Lux City!",
          "The views from in side the caves across the city are worth a visit. If you have any problems with your legs a walking stick or a friend to lean on a good idea.",
          "Great place to walk around and visit. Such history and very high above the city. Breath taking views....a must do when in Luxembourg.",
          "Good price, 10 euros for 2 adults and 1 child, we took the guidebook in English and it had a map of the tunnels. Lots of history to the tunnels and we saw a few cannons along the way, great views too. This is a must if coming to the city.",
          "This came up on my app as a castle so I was surprised when I had to go underground to get there. There is a handy leaflet from reception that explains what you can see.",
          "Exploring the Casemates was one of the highlights of our visit to Luxembourg city. We chose to do the self-guided walk (with a very helpful guide issued at the ticket office) and were very glad we did because it meant we could go at our own pace, backtrack, take in the views,",
          "Despite the 10 euro fee, this is really something you have to visit and do when in Luxembourg city, just get lost in the kilometers of tunnels inside the rock and enjoy the views!",
          "This is a must do when in the area. Every level offers incredible views of this beautiful city. Great photography opportunities. We made this a stop on our own walking tour of the city.",
          "It took us a bit to find the entrance since we started in the lower town in Grund. Once we did find the spot on top we entered and immediately joined the 11am tour in English- we really lucked out. Our tour guide did a great job with not just the basics of the history but",
          "This attraction is definitely a must see in Luxembourg. It's a place that feels like you are going back in time, walking around the corridors. It is advisable to wear comfortable shoes.",
          "This very popular tourist attraction was built in the 18th century as part of the city\u2019s defences. There is a maze of tunnels to explore and excellent views of the lower city from the cannon openings. Apart from that, there\u2019s not much to see, only some poorly explained medieval",
          "The casemates are of historical interest, but otherwise not terribly exciting for older folks. Their main attraction must be for kids, many of whom were there, dashing about the corridors and into all the niches. I imagine this web of caves carved out of the cliff feeds the",
          "Though the Casements entrance was a bit challenging to find it was definitely worth the effort. My wife and I spent a couple of hours exploring the interior. It would be a great place for a family to explore- a great way for children to learn about both history and geology.",
          "You can find this place at the end of the chemin de corniche also along the Wenceslas trail. Just look out for the signs and you should find it. You have to take a flight of stairs down from the corniche and you are at the entrance. It costs 6 euros for an adult to enter. The",
          "I have heard many times about the Casemates and the history of Luxembourg. I was finally able to see it for myself. I was certainly impressed. The city is a complex blend of the old and historic and the new and modern. However, it is clear that modern technology has been applied",
          "Walking the corridors of this place makes your mind work overtime as you could not help but to wonder how soldiers could wage battle in such conditions back then. Even though the place only has a few old canons to break up the monotony and the unstable walking condition, it",
          "If you do not have time to visit the history museum, just take a short walk (15 min) from city centre and make a tour of these casemates. A local guide could tell you a lot on the history, but there are also numerous boards displaying information. Nice view both to the city and",
          "It is good to go prepared. Read about and than go. Entry - only cash. We had to find the machine first. For all those with some claustrophobia - there are small corridors, steep stairs with little or no lights. I've seen people going through with little flash lights. I didn't",
          "To see Luxembourg is to include the Casemates. This is no doubt part of this country\u00b4s obligatory visits",
          "Grest views of the city. There is a museum but i didnt think things were well marked. The museum was only 6 euros, though.",
          "This place very well maintained. Even though they have a warning for claustrophobic people it is not bad at all. I had two people with me that are very claustrophobic people and they had no issues. The views are stunning both from on top and while in the wall.",
          "We walked the casements from one end to the other. Amazing that this structural support system has been there for centuries and still supports the Old City. The views were very nice too.",
          "I was wondering around the city's walls and I was excited with the architecture of the walls and the bridges that connect the town above the river.",
          "The Brasserie du Cercle is a great place to dine. We have been there in several occasions and have always left feeling that the food was worth our money. We tried different typical dishes from Luxemburg - all of them delicious- and also dishes the general European cuisine. All",
          "This should be on every visitors list! They give you a pamphlet with English explanations. I felt the pamphlet could have explained a bit more about the history etc but it was better than nothing.",
          "It was a very beautiful walk, with a great view of Luxembourg and the old fortress walls, but I was quite disappointed about the lack of translation on any of the plaques. It\u2019s a shame because I really wanted to learn more about the history of it, but I don\u2019t speak German or",
          "Interesting to see but lacked information beyond the first room. The front desk was unmanned for ten minutes when we arrived. Can use a Lux Card, so that is great.",
          "Hell-O again It's was my first visit in Luxembourg and 1st tourist attractions hahaha... 2 min walk from city center. Very nice view and great place for taking some photos. Of course recommended!",
          "We enjoyed walking through the maze of underground pathways. Lots of good lookout points for photos and beautiful views. Worth visiting when in Luxembourg. It's a fun experience.",
          "It is a real kind of a labyrinth with some splendid views. Worth visiting for a first-timer in Luxembourg.",
          "Interesting walk through the casemates and a good overview of the history of Luxembourg. Nice views over the town. Not a must do, but recommended for an hour and overview.",
          "This place is amazing! Perfect place to get out of the sun and heat and still be able to take in the views of the city through the holes in the wall. My friend and I had great fun exploring these caves and going down creepy tunnels and spiral staircases",
          "As a military officer, I could not skip this attraction during the short stay in Luxembouger, not to mention it's the number one tourist site in this tiny country. Thinking about its historic significance, then you feel no regret to go through the galleries, cells, and tunnel,",
          "Yes the views are nice but these views can be seen from outside on top of the entrance or on the way down to the Grund. The steps are very small and steep for my size 11 feet. It should be free I do not normally give such negative reviews but I like value for money",
          "We visited here in mid-March. We had a tour guide who was extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the casemates and the history of the surrounding area. It was a nice experience, but if I could redo it, I'd choose to go when it was a bit warmer out, as it was very cold",
          "We visited this place when we had bad weather. It\u2018s a great activity because you\u2018re inside and you don\u2018t get wet. The Casemates are nice to walk around and you can see how they build the old fortress inside the stone. Only 4stars because we also did a privat casemates tour and",
          "I visited the casamates alone. It is good value for money and is definitely worth visiting. There isn\u2019t as much to visit as I thought there would be but nevertheless, it was still good. Be warned though, the steps leading down into some areas are Very steep, small and quite",
          "I really enjoyed this experience but felt often scared when going down the long winded stairs as they were very small and narrow. The experience all in all was amazing and I can see why its considered a Unesco heritage site. I would not recommend it if you are scared of small",
          "one can certainly imagine the grand placement of such a fortified town. walking to see the different sides and views of the walls and castles is fun too. cold in March but a great couple of hours if you make the time",
          "Fun to get lost in Casemates but can definitely skip if you do not have time. Many caves and small lookouts in the path",
          "This is a spectacular historical remnant and part of the absolutely stunning Wenzel walk around the old historic city. The casemates are interesting tunnels carved into the rock/fortifications of the fort, but we thought they were overrated. It would be hard to skip skip the",
          "Tunels and secret passages with more than 3 centuries of history. It is what remains from the old fortification that Luxemburg destroyed to become neutral and Independient. It is amazing and you will also see some structures from WW II when it was used as a shelter.",
          "Great views of the city centre. We paid \u20ac6 to enter and were done within half and hour. Note that there are a number of steep steps here but once you\u2019ve navigated your way around them the sites you see are pretty awesome.",
          "You will walk through the tunnel that was built in order to o protect the city, it is amazing the way this was designed, you must visit this historic place. Vas a caminar por los t\u00faneles hecho para proteger la ciudad, es in legible ver como fueron dise\u00f1ados en su \u00e9poca, debes de",
          "All my children have a significant understanding of history and also enjoy strategy & tactics games. This visit was a great adventure. It took me awhile to conquer my fear of heights but then I enjoyed looking out of the fortifications. What an amazing part of history. It",
          "Visit the Casemates to have an idea of one of the most protected castles in Europe. From the Casemates open spectacular views of the town especially in the evening.",
          "It's incredible in any of the 4 seasons - it's an unique experience, where the past and the present connect. Strongly recommend.",
          "We were lucky to find the Casemates open in February and spent a good couple of hours wandering around the tunnels. We were given a guide printed in English which helped us understand the history of the place. Entry was good value at \u20ac6 each.",
          "Good for tourists, doesn\u2019t take a long time ~1h, and not expensive. Just that I had expected more based on what people had said but it was okay, fairly average!",
          "This place transports you to the old story of Luxembourg, inside it\u2019s kinda scary but you\u2019ll be please to see the beautiful old city through the caves. The point of you is also wonderful. Don\u2019t miss it.",
          "Since I am a native Luxembourger I have been here multiple times. Of course it becomes boring when you visit it too often. However, visiting it every few years is amazing and visiting it for the very first time even more so. You van actually experience a bit of history. Just",
          "Beautiful views from these winding caves. Not stroller friendly or for pets. Floors are a little uneven, but it was carved from rock, so it\u2019s to be expected. Just be mindful of where you step.",
          "Wandering around the casemates you get a fantastic feel of what it must've been like fightes in this fortified stronghold in the middle ages. It's like a fortress inside a mountain... it took centuries to build, but the ruins now offer a fantastic view on the city... and great",
          "We were two visiting the site. It\u2019s a wonderful place to explore. Take the time to look at over and see how that city was protected in medieval times. In the winter it\u2019s cold inside but not too cold to miss. The entry fee is moderate at \u20ac7pp, children have a lower fee.",
          "A very interesting visit to these medieval fortifications. We had a great time exploring the caves and would recommend to anyone visiting Luxembourg.",
          "As a tourist in a very small city this is a good place to visit. It was \u20ac6 entry and we were in there for approx an hour. Opportunity for some great pictures.",
          "Really fun to walk through the caves and get some amazing pictures. Doesn\u2019t take too long but something fun to do for an hour or so!",
          "Interesting to get a better understanding of the defence works and corridors underground. The booklet you receive is self explanatory and the many viewpoints offer nice views of the surrounding areas. Nevertheless, I had expected that one could wander around across a larger area",
          "If visiting Luxembourg is well worth visiting the maze of caves which run underneath parts of the city. Not mind -blowing but interesting and good vale.",
          "I found it really interesting wandering about the tunnels with some fabulous views of the area. Relatively inexpensive. Probably took about an hour to explore. Wear good walking boots as it's very uneven under foot.",
          "Casemates along the Grund is breathtaking and the best thing in Luxembourg in my opinion. I went on beautiful sunny fall afternoon which made it even more outstanding. Take your time and walk along the Grund, explore Casemate an UNESCO site.. have a picnic on the grounds or",
          "I will definitely be back to Luxembourg just to see this park during the spring or fall! It is completely unbelievable to have such an amazing spot just outside of the city centre! Can\u2019t wait to see it in the nice weather during the blossom season!",
          "Nothing special besides the history. Expect alot of walking and closed shops. Just one word for this-Boring.",
          "I loved the place for the amazing photographs we managed to have. The veranda like paths over the city is really lovely. I give it three stars as we weren\u2019t able to see the tunnels as they were closed during our visit and maybe next time we would manage to visit them.",
          "such a beautifull place and most important thing the VIEW of the city. if you want to see the the beauty of the city then this is one the best place to visit",
          "The caves are listed as UNESCO World Heritage and it is one of the nice, unique things to visit in Luxembourg. The historical explanations (not the guided tour) are light touch, easy to digest but enough to put what you see into context. I liked the fact you can get a bit of",
          "While walking from Grund up to town don\u2019t miss to visit the casemates, the caverns under the upper part of the town, that used to give shelter to soldiers and to better defend the forteress. Best in May-September.",
          "The caves are closed during the winter months due to danger of slipping. If you make your way down to the Grund, valley, you can look up to the cave windows.",
          "You can take some lovely photos of Luxembourg from here and it's really great to hear some of the history of the city!",
          "Take a walk around Luxemburg city center. Take the elevator down to Grund and walk up to Casemates du Bock. Enjoy the view from up there!",
          "Climb up from the Grund to the Casemates, and enjoy the views of the Alzette river below. Impressive construction, and alot of history here, well worth a few hours walking around and exploring the area.",
          "Beautiful buildings surrounded by ancient walls ; we did not go inside but excellent views all over the walls and the old city",
          "There are a lot of stairs inside and it is very narrow so you have to be prepared especially if you are with young children. Make sure that you can hold them if needed. The place is very interesting and you have couple of spots with very beautiful views.",
          "Discover Luxembourg's subgrounds and learn about out history. Casemates are one of the things to do and see if you come To visit our country. Hope you will enjoy",
          "this is a great place to visit.it shows why the place was so well defended in days gone by.it cost 6 euros to enter.it is like a rabbit warren when you are in there.there are steps going up and down,and many openings in the rock,used as gun points.the views from these openings",

          "The view was gorgeous. It was unfortunately overcast when I was there but I still got some good photos.",
          "Listed at the top of luxembourg attractions, the casemates do not dissapoint. The casemates are shrouded in mystery, and going through you can't help but get a feeling of advancing through a game. Really worth it, if not by the underground galleries, go for the views!",

          "Really loved the architectural and historical value of the Casemates. Unfortunately without a guide, you are just wandering around the corridors, getting lost. There are no stories or artifacts to be found that would make it more interesting. It however does offer some great",
          "Visiting with wife and young son. Such a fun place with lots of surprises. Great views and some seriously steep stairwells to the unknown. Take your time and explore and see where you end up. Possible highlight of the weekend! A must do if visiting Luxembourg",
          "We stayed at Luxembourg for only a day and decided to go to the casemate as it is a rather rare sightseeing point. I agreed with some previous reviewers that you shouldn\u2019t expect too much but this place is full of history and the narrow spiral stairwell was quite unusual for my",
          "You can see a lot from walking around the exterior walls, however the Casemates where still worth a visit and good value for money at only \u20ac5 for adult entrance. The self guided tour offers a bit of history, exploring the caves and a different view over the city. *I would not",
          "Not much to see there unless it was locked for the season or something, although I saw no such signs. The whole place can be explored in about 10 minutes. As is the case with most places in Europe, no information regarding the history of the place was provided in English, which",
          "I found these tunnels very interesting and definatley worth visiting. Although my husband said once you have seen one tunnel you have seen them all. That said we spent two hours in there.",
          "This is a warren of tunnels under the bridge. The tunnels are interesting and informative of what they were for and how they fortified the city over the years. Be very careful while walking around then that you don\u2019t end up walking through an exit as this is easily done then",
          "Lovely place to visit lots of steps footing can be difficult at time as light is low, but worth the trouble",

          "Researched this place before heading to Luxembourg. Really did enjoy it and was great to get an insight into the defence of the city and the history behind it. Good price and definitely value for money.",
          "Had an english guide so was able to learn about the different rooms and tunnels. Only \u20ac6 to enter, well worth the price. Bit dark and the floor is uneven so just watch your step, and don't bother if you're claustrophobic!",
          "Weighing the fact that this is such a unique and fascinating experience, I mean how many caves can you walk thru that were actually the old fortified city ? With the fact that it has narrow walkways, not very well lit and difficult stairs to maneuver. Well we took the Petrusse",
          "The Bock casemates are probably the best tourist attraction in Luxembourg. This site in history was used as a natural fortification and was a part of the Fortress of Luxembourg. Ruins of old castle and vast underground system of passages in the hills is now probably one of the",
          "It's hard to believe that you are only one block away from the city center with shops and restaurants and you turn the corner and you are standing on a cliff. You have to see it to appreciate it.",
          "Certainly interesting place to explore. There are nice views onto the city from inside. Going down some of the stairs might be frightening for some people.",
          "A must and great fun with children old enough to get up and down the narrow and steep stairs. Nothing for toddlers or people with mobility problems, unless you stay at the first level with the large galleries, there are some interesting views though, but the real challenge is to",
          "We are locals and took our friends from London to the Casemates on October 6th, 2017. We hadn't been there in a couple of years. I really love the Casemates and the history behind. Plus it's so much fun walking through the allies and going back in time. Many lights didn't work",

          "OK, so Luxembourg is a small city. I was recently there for 5 days and after the American Cemetery, the Ducal residence, and the Notre Dame cathedral, there's really not much to do but walk around and enjoy the beauty of the city. Nothing wrong with that! So I'm not sure if I",
          "Nice view from the casemate. On our tour we received useful information about the history and the construction of Luxembourg. After the tour you can stop at one of the terraces in the area.",
          "Incredible how this was carved in to the side of the mountains. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. Well worth a visit and for \u20ac6, it\u2019s a complete bargain.",
          "You can go round in circles forever and realise you gave yourself an extra 3miles to go 20meters down the road. Well worth a look providing you dont mind stairs or high spaces.",
          "Well. It has a lot of stairs in it. A lot! It's an experience to visit for a cheap price, but it's nothing special. But you can take good pictures and the lights are beautiful.",
          "I did not pay to enter, but walked around at the top and down some stairs. You can look out over the ville base and there are some wonderful things to see. I particularly liked looking out through the barred tunnels.",
          "We didn't have much time to visit Luxembourg but this place looked interesting so we went in. We did not wait for a guided tour but just stumbled our way around ourselves. It's a real warren of tunnels with occasional windows and staircases. Very intriguing and it's a pity that",
          "The Casemates are significant in Luxembourg's history, so I always take visitors for a brief visit. I personally don't spend hours there but enjoy seeing the old ruins on a short visit.",
          "Lovely views around the whole area. A must visit place while in Luxembourg. The climb down was not attempted by us, but there is a lift back to the top",

          "it was good to explore the different tunnels. don't worry you can't get lost. the paths are all straight forward either leading to a dead end (so you need to turn back) or to another exit point. Good for rainy day. Just be careful of your steps.",
          "who can guess that this beautiful little town is actually located in the middle of a super busy and trafficy city!",
          "We spend under an hour visiting the Casemates. It was fascinating to see how this system of fortification evolved through many centuries. If I get the chance to go back I think I'll do the visit with a guide as a lot of information was not available.",
          "One of the main tourist attraction in Luxembourg with the Casemates which used to be a self defence site. Wonder around the maze that in 1994 is listed as a UNESCO world heritage site. Just look at the map/leaflet first before visiting. One thing to becareful of it's the uneven",
          "Casemates costs \u20ac6, but it's a fun and interesting few hours if you have them to spare. I enjoyed the time spent here and I would recommend visiting this if you are in the area of Luxembourg.",

          "Key part of the history of Luxembourg city, definately recommend visiting the casemates and walk through the old walls of the fortress. Quiet an adventure to walk through the, at times tiny, corridors of the walls, and to imagine in almost complete darkness how history events",

          "The Bock Casemates and the history behind them are all integral to the very existence of Luxembourg City ... so a visit here is a must, especially if you're a history buff! Opening hours are from 10am to 8:30pm, although it's closed during the winter months (do check the",

          "If you have children you know how caves abs castle appeal, on a city break with a 4,7,9 year old and visiting these for a few hours was great. It was not overally expensive. NOTE: cash only! They do tours around but we just wandered, there is a small leaflet that gives some",
          "It was super hot as I got off the plane and my host rolled us to the Casemates du Bock. There it was rather cold. My body didn't know night from day or up from down and here I was in caverns with views of the city. Absolutely crazy. Super cool to get a glimpse of the city and",
          "Our boys enjoyed this. Lots of steps, narrow passageways and little rooms. Good leaflet to explain the different rooms. Only comment would be that the direction could be better signposted! Several times we had to retrace our steps!",
          "We were a little hesitant about entering the tunnels but were very glad we did. It's a fascinating look into the city's history, going back centuries. The tunnel floors are mostly uneven and the spiral staircases steep and narrow, but we found those easy enough to manage as long",
          "27 degrees on a lovely day in Luxembourg and what do I do. I go into a series of caves and tunnels which overlook the old side of Luxembourg. Apart from being a bit unsteady under foot. This trip is a worthwhile visit but not if you are elderly or infirm as the spiral stone",
          "An interesting place to visit to go as we had never seen anywhere like this army base camp before. It was worth a visit but I wouldn't want to be there too long and there were quite a few stairs.",
          "I can only say that it is highly worth the \u20ac5! What an interesting attraction! I shan't spoil it but please do give it a visit!",
          "It is an interesting army base camp where u can imagine that in the past, people were fighting and prisoners were kept there and also canon were there. Pretty eerie with some places having such a small space and there are many stairs going up and down and many dead ends. Very",
          "What's a good thing to do when it's raining heavily? Go indoors or even better underground in very old military defence tunnels. It's an interesting visit and gives surprising views of the city.",
          "We took a guided tour of the Casemates du Golf mid August with a guide. The interesting parts were the historical explenations received. The casemates are impressive as they were carved in the rock and served mainly to help protect the fortress and store explosives for military",
          "We were all excited about this but ended up a little scared as there were no arrows directing you where to go and the stairs were treacherous",
          "Great place to visit there was only one place that I felt a bit claustorphobic. Definately worth a visit.",
          "Feel a bit harsh giving this average but in the grand scheme of cave systems and things to do in Luxembourg there are better. Worth a visit if it is raining maybe or if you are really into history.",
          "But so much fun to explore :-) and a great escape from the heat in the middle of summer. Great views over Luxembourg from various vantage points. This attraction is included in the Luxembourg card if you happen to get one.",
          "Nature in the service of the fortress. The view from the Casemates is excellent and maybe it's the most beautiful part of the tour.",
          "Really interesting part of the old castle walls. Lots of hidden tunnels and plenty of spiral stair cases but well worth a visit. Really good place to let kids explore as there is only one way in and out.",
          "It's so easy to miss a lot of Luxembourg's history so don't! - get on a road train and also visit the military defensive tunnels built into the rocks. All very interesting and does not take long. The bars will still be open.",
          "An amazing tunnel complex. Not for the claustrophobic or those who don't like stairs. Lots of walking into the stone cliffs. Amazing to think it was all built by hand without any machinery. Some passages are large enough for horses.",
          "We followed the wenzel path, which walks through a lot of the old fortifications, including the casemates du bock. It was an excellent afternoon, if a bit tiring. Make sure that you bring plenty of water and are ready for hills and stairs!",
          "When Luxembourg was a fortress city there were apparently 35km of these defensive tunnels dug into the rock beneath the city. Here there is maybe a kilometre to explore. A UNESCO World Heritage Site it's well worth a visit because it is so unusual. The few explanatory panels",
          "There are some tricky stairs but if can manage those the view is definitely worthwhile. It is worth having a guide as well to explain the history",
          "The Bock Casements was an interesting place to visit. You walk through many tunnels and passageways that are part of this fort. You can also see old cannons, and you have several nice vistas of the city. I really enjoyed visiting this attraction.",
          "We visited the casemates on a rainy summer day. It was a very interesting and surprising experience, once you ' d never expect people could have carved those tunnels in the rock. The view of the city from the casemates is stunning and one gets surprised to see the way the place",
          "Discover the underground tunnel network. Wear sensible shioes as stones are awkward to walk on and slippy",

          "If you're going to go here, be prepared for a lot of climbing. Be careful when going up or down the stairs as they're slanted. Bring a torch (or phone flashlight) and remember where you've been. It will make leaving easier. It's quite easy to get lost here, there are a lot of",
          "Hi everyone, I visited the Bock in May 2017 and highly recommend it. Apparently a Count Sigfried acquired the Bock from an an Abbey to build his castle. Also archaeologist have recently unearth Roman artifacts. Therefore, there are many layers of history making the Bock a",
          "I enjoyed my visit to Casemates. Very interesting place with beautiful views. Quite a few steps and uneven surfaces, therefore this place is not suitable for disabled people.",
          "Fantastic view of the city. \u20ac6 per person. Some tight spaces and stairs. Can be dark in some places so watch your step. Worth the visit.",
          "Amazing tunnels carved into the cliff side but I think six Euros is a little much to pay For the lack of knowledge and literature inside the cassemates. Still worth a visit though",
          "This place has a lot of nooks and crannies to explore. I think kids would have a lot of fun here. We did too!",
          "Very interesting place. Long caves. Lots of very small staircases. Could do with better signs to say which way to go",
          "The casemates are a dramatic settling along the Alzette. Luxembourg avails many stunning vistas and photo opportunities, drawing you further & further to explore.",
          "Very easy to walk from the city centre and cheap to go inside, although me and my friend did'n't as we were running out of time. Deffo on the list if you are visiting!",
          "Good place to get views of the old and modern city. Gardens are well maintained. There are narrow steps to be aware of.",
          "If you like tunnels, mooching about in the dark and climbing stairs then this is the place for you my sister and i had lots of fun scaring each other here.",
          "Firstly be prepared, only cash is accepted at the entrance. We did the self guided tour and you are given an information pamphlet, my problem was that the place is so poorly lit that I could only read it when at places with natural light. There is very little to see or remark",
          "When you like visiting historical places this is a good one. The brochure you receive at the entrance is too limited to get a clear view on the background of the monument and how to visit it. Don't be afraid to walk on turn stairs and unstable, rocky ground. A commented or audio",
          "Great place because it offers something quite different in Luxembourg. A mix of history with a bit of adventure.",
          "If you've explored any sort of underground fortifications or tunnels before, you'll likely fine Casemates du Bock to be a bit underwhelming. It's a small space, with awkward lighting, narrow spiral staircases that lead to dead-ends, and views of construction cranes. It's worth",
          "Luxembourg .. everyone asked me why I was going and once they saw this picture they understood !! Just stunning views stunning country !!",
          "Not going to lie, I got a little claustrophobic and anxious here. But it was also VERY cool to see in person. There are great views of the city, and you can feel the history. It wasn't over crowded with people, and it was a great experience.",
          "Really good to do for a couple of hours, the views are amazing. and it is right in the city centre. Also quite nice to escape the heat!",
          "After listening to podcasts and reading tourism books we knew we didn't want to miss this. It was amazing to think how this sold the test of times. It would've been nice to have a little more information on the TVs.",
          "These are extremely impressive fortifications.Though having read other reviews,and having claustrophobia I don't thing that I would enjoy going inside them.They have left an impression on my mind ever since I first saw then over 20 years ago.",
          "Casemates du Bock is located beneath the former castle, Mont\u00e9e de Clausen. The Bock Casemates is a 17 km long tunnel, initially carved out of the rock by the Spanish between 1737 and 1746. Being a shelter for more than 35,000 locals and thousands of soldiers during the WWI and",
          "Great fun with a four year old. Hit a bunch of dead ends, climbed steep stairs, and found cannons. The stuff of which kid's dreams are made.",
          "A very insightful history of Luxembourg in the casemates of the castle. Never knew it had been fought over so many times and invaded more times than France and Belgium, which is saying something ! Whatever time of year, wear warm clothes as it's a constant 8C. We had a business",
          "I did the guided tour with Lou and it's was one of the best guided tours I ever made. The place it's incredible and be aware with the stairs to not fall down..",
          "This was the most enjoyable activity I did in Luxembourg City. You can explore deep into the casemate. Lots of dark tunnels, with occasional windows that allow you to look out over two different views of the town. It is easy to get lost in the tunnels, but it makes it more fun.",
          "The inside of the Casemates du Bock was surprisingly big with tunnels and spiral staircases winding up and down. If you are claustrophobic some of the spiral staircases are not for you. Great views from the ramparts.",
          "It was nice to walk through the open Bock Casemates. They had some plaques with the history, explaining why the casemates were created, and their varied history (many armies added to the casemates). It was interesting to actually get to walk down and through the casemates.",
          "If you are up for a bit if walking then visit the casemates, they will give you a great view over the city and the cliffwalls as well as a history lesson of the last thousand years and what has happened in Luxembourg to date",
          "A nice place to be in: a little bit cold, but there's not much to do in lux. You can have nice drinks there, yet no food",
          "A beautiful area only a short walk from the city centre. Lots of different perspectives. Historically important.",
          "The place is very nice for visiting but be prepared for a long walk inside. Also small stairs and chambers. The bad part is that is not that many things to see inside and everything ends in a dead end. So, practically, you'll gonna walk the paths twice. I also recommed to use",
          "This is the best attraction in the city in my opinion. You can enjoy a nice walk with some good views of the city. You can explore the tunnels that go throughout as well. It's a nice break from the sun too ;)",
          "The maze of corridors and very narrow passages that takes you into the depths of the fort from the past. The way of construction, complexity and atmosphere are an unforgettable part of this tour. If you are visiting this location with very young children, keep them eye-catching",
          "It is really good to visit it. It will not be the same anymore after you already went in there, but the history is well explained there and you can also walk in. Just be careful of the stairs, as they could be dangerous if you don\u00b4t pay attention at all.",
          "It is impressive that what is left of this structure has datings back to the 900s, who would've ever thought. It's neat to walk through the hallway where cannons and troops marched and imagine the history, but in all, it's a bit boring. I'm glad, for what it is and what I got,",
          "If you go to Luxembourg you have to go to Casemates du Bock. It is the highlight of the city. - Very interesting and fascinating.",
          "A great place in hot weather as you avoid the heat and the sun. We were there about half ten and managed to avoid most of the crowds and tour groups. There are narrow passageways and staircases that could prove difficult at busy times. Great views from the casements, similar to",
          "when you think of Luxembourg city, there is probably not one particular famous landmark that you think of like you would for Paris or Rome. Luxembourg has a lot to offer though, and the 'casemates' are one of those things. The casemates are basically fortifications, but they",
          "We stumbled upon the Bock by accident but the views from it are amazing! It is a world heritage listed site. On one side you can see the Catholic Church with terrace gardens and the river flowing alongside it. On the other side you look over to see lots of picturesque houses and",
          "I was exploring Luxembourg on my own while the other half was working and this was a good way to spend some time out of the sun on a hot day! The history of the place is very interesting and the information leaflet that they give you at the entrance is very helpful. I must",
          "Great historical place, but not much to do after a while. 1h there is more than enough. Wish they would have posters in English . French & German only..",
          "The casemates are 110 m long - 7 m wide and the construction was 1745; the gallery has halls with cannons and loopholes; The Bock Casemates could accommodate some 50 cannons and 1200 soldiers; On your right you can see the last rock of the fortress, called Hollow Tooth; the",
          "As you walk around the upper sections, you get great views of the valleys and the old town as well as some history about the fortress. It's a must-see. Then I discovered that there's an underground section for \u20ac6. This part is pretty short and shows you some of the fortress",
          "Used to be defensive labyrinth and part of them are opened for public. Used as shelter during WWII. Worth to visit.",
          "Visited after 14h, when the temperature was going up in the old town. What a refreshing environment! Nothing too fairy tale though still like in a fairy tale! The views from where the canons were supposed to be, some of them already in place and the explanation leaflet that",
          "I came here with a small group of friends and we spent a couple of hours wandering about and getting lost. It was great. It's historic and good fun for everyone, so long as you don't mind walking",
          "The casemate are nice to see from the outside. The inner side is quite a disappointment as there is nothing much inside except stairs, going up and down,in and out.It like a maze. I do not recommend this place for elderly as it have too many steep and narrow stairs.",
          "Lots of steep and narrow steps ,cool in summers as it was quite hot in May when we were there.interesting to pass through all those caves and tunnels",
          "It is very interesting place with impressive history although we were a bit disappointed since the part you can access is smaller than expected keeping in mind it's initial greatness. Still one should see wile visiting Luxembourg. Prepare for narrow staircases, rough stone floor",
          "i went in forgetting to take the guide/map and was surprised at the amount of paths and tunnels! i got lost several times and hit dead ends...it was fun!! it's like a maze for adults....and kids too. with everything else in luxembourg pretty much boring(bridges, churches,",

          "Really enjoyed taking a look into the history of the city through this site. The map however needs work as getting around the maze of tunnels isn't easy with a map that makes little sense. Good info and interesting day out. If you're a student then don't forget your card as",
          "This was interesting, but definitely not for those who don't walk well! There are lots of steps, some on spiral staircases. The views are excellent, and as it was a hot day, it was a cooler option!",
          "These caves are unusual but worth a look. We went in the evening and they were lit up and really nice. Built as part of a defence system .",
          "This interesting set of caverns and tunnels is great fun for kids. The views out of multiple windows are fantastic, and the descriptions of rooms and history are informative and short. It's nice and cool on a hot day, and the bathrooms super clean!",
          "There are so many nooks to see as yhou stroll or take the tourist train. Take a little time to leatn some of the history.",
          "It's not everyday you see well preserved defenses of a medieval city and Luxembourg has a remarkable example of it. Although this is just a small section of the once 23 km of tunnels that used to run through the cities impressive defenses, it is enough to both get a taste for",
          "The best part was the views from some of the openings in the passages. There is very little information about the caves themselves and my teenage daughter was less than impressed. There are a lot of tiny spiral staircases that lead no where. Not a good place for people with",
          "Really good visit here, and nice to cool down when it was so hot outside! We found the order of the guide quite hard to follow (I think we even managed to go in the wrong door quite early on!), and the English language content in general lacking a bit of historical context. We",

          "A lot of walking thru narrow tunnels (one person at a time in places), stairs and cannon placements. we enjoyed the walk but know some may have an issue with seeing the full set of tunnels. Even the shorter route without going to the very end is worth the trip.",
          "It's a very centuries old command bunker which was ripped apart by artillery fire. Nice point of view from there on the town but the bunker by itself is just a naked bunker",
          "Part of UNESCO world heritage, the casemates were originally built in 1644 by Spanish domination. Originally there was 23 kilometres of tunnels, or defence passages as they were called. Now there is only 17 kilometres, but the public only has access to a small amount. There are",

          "What an amazing piece of history and to be able to explore at your own pace made it even better. We spent hours inside going through all the passageways and even paid a small fee to see the rest. Definitely worth a visit while in Luxembourg.",
          "This place is so exquisite, haven't seen any thing like this before. A huge cave network used in the old days to protect the city from raids and invaders. This cave network covers a great area around Luxembourg city center, and had people, food and weapons stored inside. I truly",

          "I cannot say enough good things about Luxembourg City! The Casemates are a fantastic way to look out over the city (specifically the lower town of Grund) and very cool to walk through. When we went, you could pay to have a guide or see yourself around for free - we chose free.",
          "This is a fun place where you can explore the old, cave-like medieval fortifications. There was good views out over the city. It is easy to get lost here, in a good way. Unfortunately the guide pamphlet they give you when you enter only seems to be available in German and",

          "We only had a view from above, but it was an interesting site. With more time, we will definitely visit again inthe future.",
          "Bock Casemates was more colourful and fun than expected. Also a lot more exercise and staircases than anticipated. The place was like a fun and fascinating labyrinth inside the rock and we really enjoyed the walk and the view. Highly recommended.",
          "It was nice to see a different side to Luxembourg. There are great views, interesting buildings & lovely gardens. There are quite a lot of steps, so comfy shoes are ideal. Most of the signs along the way did not have English on them, which was a pity.",
          "Probably the number one attraction, but you definitely should visit it. If you're also planning to visit a museum you're better off buying a Luxembourg Card as it is much cheaper, available from the Tourist Office.",
          "Allow a couple of hours to be able to get lost inside and read the information on the leaflet (it's better if you follow the letters on the map). Wear comfy clothes and shoes, there are a lot of spiral stairs which are very narrow and the steps are worn. It's a bit chilli inside",
          "Every point in luxemburg are in walking range. Nice place to see all city and understand the history of luxemburg.",
          "Located on the east side of Luxembourg city and is closed to other major attractions such as the Barrio, St. Jean Church & the National Museum",
          "I visited Luxembourg end of March 2017 and chose the weekend when it felt like Spring had really sprung! Visiting The Casements cooled me off after the 25 minute walk from my hotel and the start of the Wenzel Circular Tour. I had printed an online map from Luxembourg City",
          "This ancient fortification provides an insight into medieval life. The fortifications were carved into the rock over hundreds of years, some large enough for horses and some small enough to make you claustrophobic. It was amazing to consider all this work was done with",
          "A lot of people have reviewed this as if it were an 'experience' or a 'ride' rather than for what it is. To appreciate this place, you must have an interest in learning, and be prepared to read the pamphlet they give you and spend time absorbing the atmosphere of the casemates",
          "I like history and old buildings e.g. fortress, castles and I had to visit Casemates du Bock. This fortress is very interesting and you can see picture-perfect views on Luxembourg. You can feel how soldiers had to live in thsi place and had to protect Luxembourg agains the enemy.",
          "I was her on a rainy day. And found it amazing despite the weather. What is left after they knocked most of it down in the 1860's is still amazing. There are some walls and some towers and some bridges. The whole thing is really great.",
          "The tour was cheap which is always a bonus. Not clearly signposted where to actually enter (as there are a view viewpoints above road level that you can view for free), and once inside it's not absolutely clear which route to take, even using the self-guided map. That aside,",
          "One of the best ways to experience the medieval fortress of Luxembourg city. It's an absolute must-go on your trip to Luxembourg! Plunge into history and make great photos of the old town.",
          "We walked through this area. It wa very interesting with beautiful views of deferent parts of the city.",
          "The self-guided tour was pretty interesting, but I'd suggest a paid tour for anyone looking to learn much about the history of the Bach Casements. On the self-guided tour you are able to discover a good amount of the Casements and will find some great views of the old town. I",
          "Amazing crypt that is really affordable and well worth the visit! This takes you through caves near the old town center of Luxembourg!",
          "Our guide Theo Krausch was awesome, he was very enthusiastic about the history of Luxembourg and Casemates. Thanks to him we learned loads of interesting information about war tactics and siege. It is a pleasure to have a chance to listen to someone who is so passionate.",
          "Even though the ticket it's only 6\u20ac there is not much to see inside. It is a good place to visit in a rainy day",
          "It was 6Euro entrance fee. The pictures from the top of the Casemates were better the pictures we captured inside. There was LOTS of stairs (wear shoes with a good grip) and it felt a bit claustrophobic at times, but it is one of those attractions you don't want to miss if you",
          "Although a very beautiful city, Luxembourg City is easily seen in less than a day. That's why it's important to fill up your time with with good visits and acrivities. Bock Casemares is the best option in town, in my opinion. It's a fun ride, with narrow tunnels and an Indiana",
          "The Bock Casements was one of the main reasons I decided to visit Luxembourg. The tunnels carved out of the solid rock was an amazing feat and it was cool to see the cannons placed throughout. The views from the Casements was probably the highlight. Overall, I did not learn too",
          "It is nice to see the views from there, and I imagine if you are really into history. But to be honest, you can actually see the views from the wall without paying any ticket, and not much to see inside, just long caves that used to be used for military purposes. I would not",
          "This sight spot is fairly boring. We went as a group for a day activity. For 6\u20ac it is corridors under the ground, but not really as it is located inbetween two parts of Luxembourg. It is interesting as a dark maze and you do come to an obstacle (maybe by accident) and this is",
          "Good fun exploring the caves with the kids. If you are claustrophobic then you may not want to venture too deep.",
          "We found this to be very interesting and will likely visit again. On rainy days this is an excellent option for guest visiting Luxembourg of if you yourself are a tourist.",
          "Luxembourg or Gibraltar of the North, the never military defeated fortress, the casemattes are part of it, hand digged in rock, with fantastic views on both Sides of the Rock where the castle was build on top. Open now till end of october",
          "Really picturesque! It's quite steep to get up and down but there is actually a lift at the end closer to the city. Great place to take photos and just enjoy the view.",
          "This was a highpoint of our trip. The battlements and its extended tunnels are really worth seeing. Amazing to imagine the history and all the work put into its construction. From the canon ports there are spectacular views of the old city and the rivers. Not recommended for",
          "Good view of valley and bridges near by. Good spot for taking pictures and selfies. It is closed in winter. So I could visit but still worth to pass by for good view of city.",
          "An amazing fortification, built in 963, that was part of a much larger complex. The case-mates were used during times of war to house thousands of soldiers and their horses. What I found most fascinating was how large the case-mates are which enabled blacksmith shops,",
          "Stop by the visitors center and book a walking trip. You will get to see and visit the entire city and also see the casemates.",
          "Because it was winter, this site was closed, but hearing the history and seeing it from outside was good enough. Michaela our guide was so well informed!",
          "The walls of this fortified town are an absolute must see. From Casements du Bock you get a great view of Grund, the old part of town.",
          "Seeing all the cave openings in the cliffs, we were curious to go inside and take a look. It was fun exploring and the views from the openings were lovely. It is hard to imagine a large number of people camped out in those caves. And it was interesting to find out that they were",
          "Lovely to wander along and take in the engineering feat of this structure. Great views from up here. A real historic treat.",
          "view is really good .makes you calm and relax! little city ( country ) has its own beauty ! even people comes from france to work there ! only thing didn't like it lots of strange woman walking around train gar !!!",
          "I was here during December 2016. The views are amazing and it's a pretty nice walk. Pro tip: Le Chemin de la Corniche, Barrio Grund, Casemates du Bock, Viaduc you can do it in all one afternoon, they are located close to each other.",
          "Nice work of engineering, worth a walk around to see the caves and the views. If you have time it is nice to go all the way down to the river and then up again.",
          "The \u201cBock\u201d is a large rocky promontory jutting out over the River Alzette. \u201cCasemates\u201d are rooms carved into the walls of a fortress. The Casemates du Bock are thus the rooms and storage areas carved out of the Bock. These are the remnants of the old fortresses that used to",
          "Must see in Luxembourg, dont forget to check the open-close time and working days. Enjoy the amazing view.",
          "It was a cold and very foggy morning with 0 km visibility accordingly to accuweather. Really can't see much. But if its clear on a summary day, it would have been spectacular, looking down at the city beneath...",
          "Its one of the attractions in luxembourg. Again a place of historical importance Unless you wanna visit the trail or the castles worth spending your time here",
          "Unbelievable what mankind has build in time. Unbeatable strategic area. This was the heart of a great fortress",
          "Unfortunately, it was closed but the view on top is amazing. Tips: 1.many tours , places are close whole winter please check and book them before you go there. But for me it was not a big problem as I only want to spent a lazy holiday with my family in Luxembourg. 2.around",
          "Self-guided walking tour. A bit confusing (the \"map\" and signage could use some updates in the English version) but well worth it. Stunning views of the city.",
          "Visiting the Casemates is definitely a part of the City, but what you see from the outside is all there is. Some tunnels are available and you can walk up and down some narrow steps but the history and museum could do more to present a greater picture. Perhaps memorable for",
          "The place is fantastic to visit especially is you take the walk around the streets and view the river while you cross the different bridges.",
          "You must take a walk around this historical part of Luxembourg. It has a great story to tell along with some breathtaking views of the local area.",
          "Such a lovely attraction! Day or after the sun goes down, because of the lights. Many sights to explore!",
          "The expectation you have waling towards the Bock is to see some medieval/renaissance military constructions. You'll see a couple of walls and some random panels barely explaining what these walls are supposed to be. Extremely underwhelming. If you go visit any other European",
          "We walked in, not at all knowing what to expect. The tour is \"labeled\" (you follow letters on your map that correspond to letters on the wall) so it's actually pretty hard to get lost down here. You also periodically see through \"holes\" in the wall to the outside, most of which",
          "Ok but neither easy to follow nor interesting.we sheltered from rain but might have been better to use umbrella",
          "I really enjoyed going through the network of tunnels and cells of this historic fortress. Makes you feel as if you were in Medieval times. Has a lovely view of Luxembourg. Not for the claustrophobic though.",
          "First time in Luxembourg and this looked different so decided on a visit. Interesting to see, not suitable for anyone with mobility issues, and small children might struggle a bit as well. That said if you can get around i think it's worth going.",
          "Suffice to say, that Casemates du Bock and P\u00e9trusse Casemates are inscribed in the list of world heritage sites by UNESCO. Therefore it is a must to see. For some it can get boring (lots of passages, loopholes, staircases and some narrow areas) but it is definitely",
          "If you don't know what to do in luxembourg, this is a must do. Take confortable shoes cause you will need them.",
          "A very interesting part of Luxembourg cities history. Could perhaps do with a bit more signposting and explanation of the different parts and be warned there are lots of narrow steps to negotiate if you want to see it all. Quite cheap though at 4 euros per adult",
          "This was an interesting place to visit. The tunnels are numerous, but following the plan on the leaflet you can visit them in order. The views from the casemates are good in all dierctions. Some of the tunnels are less well lit than others, but that didn't spoil our enjoyment.",
          "The enterance fee is 4 euro's. The vieuws are great but inside there is no indicated route to follow, so when you take the narrow stairs, halfway there are people going the opposite direction and there is no place to pass. Worth a visit because of the historical importance",
          "You must visit this attraction..my biggest recomendation!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the admission fee is only 4 euro for adults..worth every cent",
          "The casemates du Bock are interesting to experience, have great views of Luxembourg city, and present the history of the site. Seemingly like most things in Luxembourg, the thing that would have been the most beautiful (the fort which sat upon these casemates) has been",
          "This is a must see when you you are in Luxembourg, the history is incredible. Make sure that you include going inside the fortress to see exactly how this city was defended.",
          "This is a spectacular place and as a major factor for the development of the city, an absolute must for every visitor to Luxembourg. Take care, it may be cool and moist, especially when you are visiting in fall or winter.",
          "The train through the Grund is a good way to start your exploration of Luxembourg's Grund, with a tale of Siggy and Josefina. The casemates themselves are pretty basic but it's a nice walk. Probably one of the best things to see in Lux.",
          "It's quite an adventurous thing to go inside and watch out for the letter signs to give you directions. I am sure you will get lost on the way once or twice but the entire experience is really worth it.",
          "It was a very interesting place, but we couldn't stay in there too long as in some parts it felt a little claustrophobic. Lots of tunnels, but had great views. It was difficult to find and we seemed to go around everywhere to find the entrance. Very reasonably priced.",
          "We started our free, self-guided walking tour around the walls here. The casemates are a series of tunnels in the walls of the city which used to house defensive cannons. They remain pretty much intact with considerate lighting and provide unique views across the city. The",
          "To get to see Luxembourg you need to get down into the old town and also recommend the two walking routes which both start here",
          "This place is so amazing and very interesting to visit and explore.. The tunnel construction is so nice and show you the way of Military secrets.. The walkways is very nice and really will make you to explore the ways to defend the old city.. Many rooms and sides to view the",
          "Maybe you got to have a lively imagination to enjoy this as much as we did. It is a short, cheap and exciting experience that we recommend if you pass by. Use good shoes if you want to venture into the deepest part.",
          "The casemates are quite large, but after some time, it is still the same. Tunnels, lots of stairs and dead ends. But we liked it and for the price it is definitely worth to visit.",
          "I've seen people there and never knew how to get there, but we finally make it out and gave it a go. It costs 4 EUR per adult. Right at the start before you enter the tunnels is a short historical summary and explanation what those tunnels were used for. Further information are",
          "From the Le Chemin de la Cornishe, you can easily reach the Casemates. Interesting fortification with lots of corridors and staircases built many years ago. Cost for Adults: 4 Euros, Kids 2 Euros. Lots of walking and not handicap friendly. There are bathrooms next to the",
          "Well worth the 4\u20ac admission to see the complexed underground world. Plenty of stairs if you are into following all the pathways. Before doing this get a walking map of the Grund from the tourist information in town and do a self guided walk which will add to your Casemates"

I was there standing about two hours and watching the incredible view from casamate..Honestly I didn't want to leave! I love this great locations, is quiet but it got too much to show! I will definitely return back!",

          "A real beautiful historic sight, Unique place. This World Heritage site was very very impressive! Nicely organized, This is priceless to see. Peace and Nature with great ancient architectural significance,  definitely worth a visit.",
          "A great part of a city walk through Luxembourg. Excellent maintained, though some steeper parts are necessary to traverse, generally it easy to do.\n\nLast time was about 13 years ago. The only difference is what part is being restored. In \u2026",
          "Historical part of the city with a very nice walkable tour aournd the Casemates.",
          "We were very sad to learn these were closed to the public due to renovations when we visited. Nevertheless they looked very cool from the outside and we will definitely come back sometime to explore the interior.",
          "Very impressive historical place",
          "Very cool to explore all the nooks and crannies.  If you find an open door with a narrow staircase, just go for it and see where it ends up.  Good job with added safety lighting and handrails that don't detract from the historic character.",
          "It\u2019s something to do in Luxembourg and it\u2019s a heritage site too. I felt that once you have seen the view from both sides, you have pretty much seen it at that point - was just underground tunnels with openings on each side (so imagine it\u2019s \u2026",
          "It's a good place to visit while in Luxembourg city on a not so good day. About 7\u20ac entrance fee and you can explore the vast complex of underground tunnels & galleries, begun in 1644 & used as WWII bomb shelters. Worth a visit if you in the area.",
          "Quite interesting, but hard to know where to go. We almost missed a staircase leading to a whole extra floor and saw at least one other couple standing around wondering where to go (we showed them to the staircase). All in we saw everything in about half an hour, which seemed quite quick, wonder if we missed anything.",

There are some lookout points where you can see nice views, but it's just similar looking corridors. I spent about 30 mins down there.",
          "The casements were boring and the information boards were not in English making it a waste of time to visit.\nI would suggest paying the extra and joining a guided tour as these are provided in English if you wanted to visit this world heritage site.\nPersonally I would suggest spending the time visiting other areas of the city.",

We would love to discover it, i wonder how much of the suppose to exist and left 17km of underground is possible to access ? I love to find out ;)",
          "Not the first time we have been here but it\u2019s been 10 years. It hasn\u2019t changed. Great time exploring the tunnels. Kids had fun and it was a relief on a hot day to be inside and cool. Get a map though. Not hard to get lost but to know u went everywhere. It\u2019s a walk so wear comfortable shoes and watch ur step",
          "Luxembourg is very beautiful city. I have amazing time there",
          "Lovely place, shame it's not open in integraty. It's meant to be over 20 km of corridors, but you can only visit 1km.\nLovely views of Luxembourg and interesting to imagine how it could've been used as shelter",

          "You need to visit this amazing historic place. Here you will find something which is really carved in stone ;-). In hot summer, even a good place to calm down. Recommendation: Could be an option to buy the Luxembourg card at the Tourist information. Entry fee, public transport and other attractions are included.",

          "Thoroughly enjoyed our walk around all of Luxembourg City including the casements and municipal park. One of the nicest, cleanest cities in our entire European trip",
          "Beautiful views of the city. Great place for amazing photos. You can park in the theater parking garage and walk for few minutes ( and hour or 2 for 4 euros). There is a part outside that is free and if you want to go inside it\u2019s 7 euros \u2026",

          "This is an interesting place to walk through. With the Luxembourg card it was free but if we had paid the regular entrance fee, which think is $15EU I would have been very disappointed. Feel they could do a better job with signage so you can easily make your way around. You just kind of wander around without knowing where to go next.",
          "It was cool, but very repetitive. We went down a staircase that brought us down, around, across, and right back up on the other side of the wall we went down. Also a spot for couples to find private corners to make out in. Views were decent, but you can see the same things without paying from above.",
          "I really recommend visiting the Casemates because it's a very nice experience. The panoramic views are amazing. The tunnels are illuminated and very easy to use. It's safe also for visiting with kids. They don't give you a map for the \u2026",
          "Even without paying the entrance fee and going inside the walls, there is a lot to see just by walking around the ramparts and looking at the plaques. The info is in French  and German, though. Amazing views of the Grund and other ancient parts of the city and its bridges.",
          "Nice visit, but it's difficult to navigate all the sections because there aren't clear signs and direction arrows. You'd expect it to be better organized and maintained for the \u20ac7 entrance fee they're charging.",
          "Great price. The tunnels are stunning, be careful if you are tall though as you'll easily hit your head!\n\nIncredible views too!",
          "An interesting place to see if you are visiting Luxembourg. I still go there once in a while at night to just sit and enjoy the view of the old town",
          "Very interesting! It was a bit busy, so sometimes we had to wait to look at a view or something. You might consider doing the guided tour, there isn't much information in the Kazematten if you walk trough yourself.",
          "A nice place to visit! It doesn\u2019t look so bug from outside, but its totally a surprise inside! The views are pretty cool from inside! Specially the narrow staircases from the olden days are a bit adventurous!",
          "Not too pricey with only 7 euros for entrance and the tunnels are amazing to walk through (and nice and cold on a hot day). The only thing I missed was some more information (English would be a great addition). Also the lighting in some places was not great.",
          "Excellent experience with kids, to see the history of the cliffs and castle, but to be able to explore, wander around and see the city from a different view.",
          "it is UNESCO heritage of 17 k.m. long tunnel with an amazing view. The ticket was 7 EUR per person for the tunnels. It is not wheelchair or pram friendly.The tunnels had interesting spots inside about where people hid themselves. They can \u2026",

          "One of most interesting places in Luxembourg, to visit. Many caves and long tunnels drilled in bare rock. Very nice views from inside.",
          "I would love to give this place the full five stars that it deserves, but it is under construction, so if someone is planning a trip mainly to see this attraction they should consider this.\n\nA good deal of the structure is not accessible \u2026",
          "It's an amazing piece of history, I would recommend trying the guided tour in order to have a better experience",
          "The price of 7 euro is too expensive for what you get in return. The lack of signs makes it difficult to find your way through the tunnels and understand the history of the place. The whole sight can be visited in about 30 minutes. If you have seen castles before, it is not really worth visiting.",
          "I recommend that you get a ticket and visit the undergrounds. This is a three-dimensional maze made in a Mountain. Fun experience!",
          "There are nice views from balconies and cannon holes. The place is badly signed though so we had to circle back a few times. Not much description either.\nOn the plus side, I enjoyed colourful lights installed in the caves.",
          "You have to pay to go inside and it\u2019s a tad overpriced. The passages might be fun for kids to explore but otherwise it\u2019s a bit cramped and repetitive. You can get the idea from the outside without going on. That\u2019s where the great views are anyway.",
          "A sneak peak literally down the history of this beautiful place called Luxembourg",
          "Incredible views within and toward outside. Exhausting to walk but totally worth it. I would go again.",
          "Unique place, even more beautiful by night and when it snows",
          "A great way to walk in the history of this beautiful city. You can get wonderful views from the Casemates of Luxembourg City. There could be clearer signage for easier navigation. Definitely take one of the info leaflets to help you get around!",
          "Dungeons under the city of Luxembourg. Nice thing to see and enjoy the view on the whole Luxembourg. In shooting points You will find cannons, nice to take a picture of yourself with them.",
          "Great place to visit. But lot to walk if you want to enjoy the beauty.",
          "One of nicest spots to go for a drink near the palace and with nice preserved old town style. You will also find a free museum nearby, an amazing view to grund. Check also the caves during spring or summer.",
          "Interesting tunnels for a reasonable price. Not recommended if you have claustrophobia or if you aren't very mobile because there is a tight spiral staircase, dark areas with uneven ground and thing corridors. \nGood views of the city from \u2026",
          "One more heritage place... What mesmerizes is the restoration, preservation of the age old structures.... Excellent efforts by Luxembourg government and UNICEF",
          "I only had a day in Luxembourg.  This is an easy walk from the train station and was a great experience.  Note- need cash for entry.",
          "The views from going under here are very similar to the views from the top of the museum which is free. Paid zero as had Luxembourg card but would have been disappointed if I'd paid 7 euros for a small exhibit and entrance to dungeon with windows out showing the same 2 view points.",
          "A bit pricy,  not much to see minus the view.",
          "Nice walk across the Wenzel path led us besides these huge defensive structures. Highly recommended, but beware the steep climbs.",
          "Really nice place to explore the history of Luxembourg. The entrance fee is 7e per adult and cash only. I had to go to ATM and the closest one is quite an uphill walk away so be sure not to do the same mistake.",
          "Great place to wander and explore! Not too crowded (we got there pretty early). Great for all ages, but be ready to walk and climb up and down stairs.",
          "You can discover some cool caves, kind of a mini maze too ! Should check out if interested in history of the place. Also offers some cool views of city ! The whole trip only takes 30mins inside caves.",
          "Must visit at Luxembourg. \n\nHistory:\n\nIn 963, Count Siegfried built a fortified castle on the Bock promontory, which was soon to become the cradle of the city. In the course of the centuries, on the western side, mighty ring walls were \u2026",
          "No comment. Must visit. No dogs allowed. So we didn't. But we understand. Great environment. Good place to walk downtown.",
          "Interesting enough place to visit and see.  Not a lot of information is given about it though.  I learned more about it from Google and Wikipedia.",
          "Is always a pleasure to walk along this big walls, is relaxing and peaceful.Is fully worth his UNESCO title.Is better to visit this during the autumn or before the summer as this could become crowded",
          "Awesome place to explore in Luxembourg. Works you legs out for a good sit down dinner!",
          "Beautiful old walls and fortress, it's only been open to the public since the 1930's and had been used in WWll as a bomb shelter for up to 35'000 people! This capital is one of my favourite cities in Europe! Absolutely stunning, like you are walking around in a storybook...",
          "Quite a fun time with the family. Great views outside and cool caverns inside. Put it on your list.",
          "Very interesting, affordable and great views of the city. Lots of stairs however so just a heads up. Worth doing for sure.",
          "This site offers amazing views, a must see when in Luxembourg City. The casemates aren't open all the time, but there's plenty to see even when closed. The river valley is beautiful with flowering trees, an open vista and the classic architecture. It's also an easy walk from the city center.",
          "It is the first underground tunnels built in 1644, in the era of the Spanish domination.40 years later they were enlarged by the French military, and in the eighteenth century by the Austrians. It was great to know more information.",
          "Must visit when in Luxembourg. WWII bunkers",
          "A great labyrinth, perfect for young explorers but not too much by w\u00e0y of historical context is provided. I'm sure there must be a wealth of stories about the casements over the centuries ?",
          "Like taking a trip back in time! Enjoyed walking through it, amazing views, history is all around you here:)",
          "Amazing history. Lots to explore. Be prepared for many stairs, cool temperatures, and some very narrow passageways. Some incredible views of the city below from the archways of the labyrinth. Definitely worth the bit of cardio.",
          "7 euros per person to enter but totally worth it. Really unique experience to wander around the casemates and you get a lot of nice views of the city too.",

          "Really nice! Definitely should walk around and visit this place in Luxemberg!",
          "Interesting history. Good views. Worth a visit if you have extra time on your hands",
          "We took out two girls (3 & 5 years old) into the caves. They loved it the excitement of exploring what\u2019s next or down the steep spiral staircases was a great adventure. \n\nThe leaflet issued to you as you pay is good but there could be a \u2026",
          "I advise to take the guided tour (even as a Luxembourger, I learned plenty of stuff) !",
          "Amazing site. Plenty to see. A lot of area to roam around.",
          "This panoramic area of Luxembourg is breathtaking - the history is great too",
          "These walls and the walkways are breathtaking. Do not miss this. Put on your hiking shoes and go walk everywhere. Don't miss a single spot",
          "Nice to visit but it's only a lot tunnels, they also do not accept bank cards!! Only cash!",
          "It was really fun and bit confused. But we should have stamina to walk around the cave! It was like a puzzle.",
          "Really nice place, worth too see definitivelly",
          "Super cool area, I would recommend just visiting and exploring all the free areas. Very nice, so no need to pay",
          "Super awesome, enjoyed my cigar looking at historical yet modern view... booked  guided tour the next day",

          "Not open, no signs telling either opening times or dates",
          "Very impressive to see and experience. The history of how the people defended luxembourg in the past is very interesting. The tour guide was a bit boring but a very nice and wonderful man. The people of luxembourg are very proud of their heritage and culture.",
          "We had not really planned to visit Luxembourg, but are very glad we did. Lots to see and do, very prosperous, just shows what low tax does for your economy. Some wonderful public spaces and facilities.",
          "The interpretive signage is not in English sadly but there is a small pamphlet in English that guides you through the interior nicely. It\u2019s a very interesting tour within for both the history as well as the amazing panoramic views. I would definitely recommend it.",
          "Old castle of Luxembourg . Nice and interesting experience through the casemates and tunnels .",
          "The highlight maybe of my trip in Luxembourg!Amazing view down to the valley.You relax with the serendipity caused from the huge amount of green!You can get a lot of photos from above and after that enjoy a walk down to the Petrusse valley crossing short bridges,waterfalls and beautiful parks!Don't miss it!",

          "Absolutely stunning. I'm very happy that we made the time for this attraction.",
          "Interesting with some nice views, but i did expect to see something more about the history. A bit expensive for what it is though",
          "No information given at the reception, everyone gets lost, no English maps or information. It is definitely too expensive (7\u20ac) for what it is. It is completely trash, it's a money grabing strategy",
          "Interesting and quite impressive, there isn't much to see diversity wise.",
          "Lots of nice views, very informative and a nice play to go to get away from the heat on a sunny day.",
          "Useful information they should add on their website and description is that they only take cash, and that there is no nearby cash machine. For that reason, I wasn't able to enter and can only give it 1*.",
          "Beautiful view of the city. It has stairs to go on multiple levels. Great location for photos.",
          "Best place to cross from Grund to town",
          "Good view but thats all, a bit boring to be honest",
          "Very beautiful views, nice historic spot. Adult tickets cost 7 euros. Very recommendable!",
          "Must see if you visit Luxembourg. Interesting to explore",
          "The Bock Casemates are more than a kilometer in length, and the most fulfilled cave is 110m x 7m. This fantastic complex of caves (which one day was 23 km long) made Luxembourg one day known as Gibraltar in the north.",
          "The best place I have seen in all my travels around Luxembourg. It's wonderful every corner you can visit and you can take very nice pictures from the 4 different facades. Is a must if you visit the country. Don't forget it or you'll miss \u2026",
          "One of the very few places to visit in the city of Luxembourg. \nThe Luxembourg city doesn't have spoken many location to visit this one is worth the visit. \nThe place is very nice to have a visit. \nCassandra dude bock have few caves inside which looks beautiful and must visit with your kids. \nMust wear shoes \ud83d\udc5f",
          "Lots of history to explore here. We had a guide for a couple of hours and well worth it.",
          "To be honest, there\u2019s nothing in it, just a complex cave or a maze, but costs \u20ac7 per adult. I think it\u2019s not worth.",
          "Beautiful we went to luxembourg only for 1 day on our way to paris. Casemates du Bock I found on internet and really wanted to visit people say the entrance is hard to find but that is false! We found it immediately and when you ever are in Luxembourg it is worth a visit",
          "Insane. So old so cool best thing we saw on our 20 day trip",
          "very interesting",
          "Its included in the Wenzel Walking Tour. So you may want to skip doing this on your own, if you're booking the tour.  It is a ticketed tour but the price also includes entry to Bock casemates.",
          "Excellent place to visit in Luxembourg city. Luxembourg city is not huge so not lots to see but this is one thing you should visit. It is a series of under ground tunnels and caves which were part of the original fortifications of the city \u2026",
          "Definitely a must see while in the city! The place wasn\u2019t too overcrowded and very clean.",
          "Lots of climbing up and down stairs. Great views. Do it if you have time and nothing else to do.",
          "Great pice of Luxembourg history. Breathtaking views on old town.",
          "So unique. I have never seen such a place like this.  It's a must place to see if in Luxembourg",
          "Probably it the best POI in Luxembourg, but I can't say, that casemats are amazing.",
          "The historical point that is important for both eastern and Western European. Hence the castle was destructed in world war and everyone hope to capture this part as the defensive spot",
          "Lovely place to explore the Casemates. The kids loved going through the various caverns, but there are lots of stairs!\n\nWe probably covered it all in about 1hr, though as we had small children, we weren't able to go on a guided tour which I am sure would take longer.",
          "Very nice piece of history with a great view over Luxembourg",
          "Was interesting but a lack of signage will frustrate how you get through it.",
          "Stunning views!!!! I could stay there the entire day just exploring the area and enjoying the amazing view.",
          "Wanderful country we took bus tour from bruxell in Belgium.. To many wanderful areas.",
          "Interesting place to visit who like history. They are made in 17th century. It is a labyrinth in the rock what seems like was constructed as a shelter in case of a war.\nIt coasts 7\u20ac for adults to visit",
          "Good price at \u20ac7 to enter. It is literally a short stroll under Luxembourg in an area dug out in the 17th century to house canons. Other than that it's a rock face with viewing points. Lasts about 20 minutes.",
          "Very cool!  Definitely recommended.",
          "If Luxembourg becomes too hot for your liking, you can take refuge in these cold passageways for the generous price of 7\u20ac. Otherwise just a couple of scenic cave balconies. Three stars, one extra for the temperature.",
          "Interesting place to walk around. Make sure you get a brochure from the front because there are no other information markers throughout. The place is also cash only.",
          "This place is amazing and I am impressed by the way it has been looked after, after so many years.\n\nI was dissapointed to see that there weren't any English translations as with this I would have rated the visit \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f",
          "It really  needs more explanation p\u00f3sters and better lights. Luxembourg landmark, do not miss a visit",
          "Interesting place to visit, quite spacious with many ins and outs to discover",
          "Amazing landscape. Great place for hiking.Lots of places to discover. Lots of parking lot around (not free)",
          "Interesting old fortress to explore well worth the 7euro. Has good views of the surrounding area.",
          "Nice historical place but need some maintenance",
          "This place offers some great insight on the start of Luxembourg. Also a nice place for plane spotting. Look out for the majestic 747s and 777s ;)",
          "7 EUR entrance fee - relatively cheap activity for Luxembourg",
          "Casemates of Bock in Luxemburg city, very nice and restaurated. You may combine with a lovely trip around the city center (old city) and the surroundings of Neum\u00fcnster",
          "Visited this place with guide Alex and learned  lots of interesting facts about the history of Luxembourg. Can only recommend!",
          "Fascinating but Also the right place where to cool down when outside are 35 degrees.",
          "The climbing up and down can be a little strenuous but the photos were worth it. It's amazing the work that has been done to preserve architecture.",
          "One of my favorite things about this city. Full of history and has beautiful views over the valley. I recommend taking the guided tour that happens in the spring till autumn.",
          "Historic fort for dating back to 965. Great views",
          "Amazing history. Well maintained",
          "Wonderful place that takes you back several hundred years in history.",
          "Very interesting to compare and contrast with the Casemates at the north east corner of Dover Castle",
          "If you like wandering around old tunnels this place is perfect. The tour is self guided so you're free to explore every nook and cranny as you please. Beautiful views of the city from every window.",
          "No option for zero stars. Because they wouldn't let me in. I walk with sticks and their rule is disabled people with walking aids are not allowed. I am perfectly able to navigate uneven surfaces and steep stairs but they would not leave it up to me. I will complain and hope they change the discriminatory policy.",
          "Great place to visit. Not expensive and very interesting.",
          "Lovely historical sight. When we visited there was a jazz band playing inside and it was amazing. Ensure you have a map when walking through the site as one area is a dead end and requires a long walk back.",
          "Very nice, caves, nature all in a big city centre",
          "Our entry was included with the Luxembourg card, but if you pay it is well worth the money as we spent such a long time seeing almost everything (one section was closed). Make sure to pick up a map/guidebook at the front desk as there is no information as you go round. Well worth a visit!",
          "Amazing and breathtaking view! You can't leave the city without visit it. Check availability during the winter time.",
          "The Casemates are a super cool place to visit, though it would likely be better in the summer when more of it is open. Great views of the city and river at any time though all of which are freely accessible.",
          "Awesome place to visit.great way to experience history... beautiful maintained and givee a out of world experience...",
          "Cool place to visit with some good views over the city",
          "Probably the main attraction in the city, often called 'balcony of Europe'! It's a beautiful place to go to. You can walk through the trails and  centuries old tunnels. There are two lifts operating nearby, one of them with stunning view! \u2026",
          "Very picturesque place but there really isn't a lot to do around the area",
          "Nice and interesting place to see, not much more to it but if you find yourself in Luxembourg city you should visit this place.",
          "Very cool historic defense works! I suggest to take the guided tour because we almost got lost! There's stairways and hallways into every direction so we didn't know where we had been or still had to go. The view is great out of each window \u2026",
          "We took a family trip to downtown Luxembourg to check out the ruins. We took the train from Wasserbillig. (Super affordable with the day fare for up to 5 people!) and enjoyed walking through the streets of Luxembourg. The castle was very \u2026",

          "It's a absolutely beautiful place to be I highly recommend visiting",
          "Super cool place to explore. It is a must visit",
          "This was really fun. A little hard to navigate though.",
          "Good for a short visit. Its a network of underground tunnels.. It takes a little above an hour to enjoy the place.",
          "The rock where the city began. Random caves that are not even properly lit and there are zero directions. Only a short historical display at the entrance. If you go deep enough, you end up in a dead end smelling of piss.",
          "nice caves ending on a beautiful city view",
          "Beautifully maintained underground ruins. Tour comes with a booklet with details on different points of interest, but I found the path pretty confusing and had to do two circuits instead. There is also a guided tour available, though I \u2026",
          "Network of tunnels with great views. Lots of steep spiral steps and entrance not too obvious.",
          "Interesting caves underneath the battlements and ramparts around Luxembourg City. You\u2019ll need about half an hour to see them.",
          "Great caves and tunnel constructions. Don\u2019t miss the lower tunnel under the Bridge.",
          "\ud83d\ude01",
          "a journey through history! some nice spots for taking photos. entrance fee is reduced if you're a student. there are not many direction signs inside and you may get lost a little bit so don't forget to bring the map with you. also beware of the narrow and spiral staircases.",

          "A must visit place... They don't take card so you need to get cash which is the sad part",
          "Nice for a private stroll with friends/partner. Otherwise uneventful and devoid of content.",
          "Wonderful place to walk around and through. If you want to go inside, there is a fee. However there is plenty to see around and many different trails or paths to keep you busy. Very photogenic place and interesting.",
          "UNESCO heritage ... Good place to visit",
          "Impressive, good visit, even though the weather was not quite playing along",
          "Nice place to visit. Liked all the underground corridors.",
          "Fantastic viewpoint with even its own photo point. The view from the top was fantastic to look at the lower points of Luxembourg. Didnt go in because of time reasons but would recommend visiting it for the scenery.",
          "Interesting but I wish I'd done a guided tour because there wasn't much information provided. Nice to wander through but easy to get lost (and end up missing parts, or walking the same parts twice) which would be avoided on a tour",
          "Worth it to see as it gives insight into the history of Luxembourg.",
          "Signage could be better, but very interesting walk through.",
          "This was excellent, but some may think it's not worth \u20ac7.",
          "Interesting network of tunnels which have provided shelter to Luxembourgers in time of need from wars and seiges to a recent heat wave.",
          "Very beautiful and educational but 7\u20ac for the entrance fee it\u2019s excessive! At the end we didn\u2019t go in because we thought it\u2019s not fair for them to charge the same amount for a cave than for the whole gorgeous Vianden castle.",
          "One world heritage in kuxemburg",
          "Free to go and quite nice view of the small village below (didn\u2019t know how to get down there from the top tho)",
          "Wonderful place to be in.\nVery well maintained, best place to view the beauty of Luxembourg.\nRiver canal inbetween is next to perfect.\nIt all looks just like a painting.\nThere is a small bridge before entering the place, the view from there is just mind blowing.\nMust and must visit place in Luxembourg.",
          "Nice and histotical place. Absolutely to be visited when in Luxembourg.",
          "We visited these caves thinking that could be more interesting than it actually was. The actual caves are a lot bigger that what if opened to the public. Is an ok stop to visit but you will not loose anything if you spend the time visiting the surroundings instead of the caves",
          "Huge fortress, but no English sign or explaination.",
          "Very unique site to visit, a little hard to follow the markers but that makes it all the more fun for exploring.",
          "Amazing place in lovely surroundings. Entrance cost about 6 euros so very reasonable. Recommended",
          "A must during your visit to Luxembourg, gives you a wonderful view of the old city",
          "Enjoy taking photos here.",
          "The former fortress of Luxembourg. You pay a \u20ac5 entry fee and are then left free to roam the caves. There is a small section of information on the history and then you can explore the rest for yourself. Looking out of the windows, you get \u2026",
          "Immered into something new. Not all the time you will see and be inside on a prison. Tour guide is very knowledgeable. Good place to visit! Book ahead of yime begore arriving!",
          "Really cool area.",
          "I wonder why they didnt free entry for this.",
          "Took the guided tour which cost extra. The tour guide Louis was very knowledgeable and able to answer questions. They offer Geman/English tour twice daily and French/English once daily. \nHowever, the front desk was a bit rude. \n\nThe fort \u2026",
          "A must see for any visitor, a little dark and cold, and please not for people with knee problems.",
          "An awesome experience. The history is incredible.",
          "Cash only. Literally the only time I would have had to withdraw cash. Apparently this place is still stuck in the Middle Ages.",
          "It was indeed, like it said, a lot of stairs. And the route could become confusing at some points. But we wandered of the regular route.",
          "This was absolutely incredible to see! Well worth the 6 euros! They had a piece of it closed off for construction but still worth it even without that section!",
          "Nice views from the site. Exciting for the kids.",
          "Nice place to visit and see the history, if you have a booklet or a guide. Inside there is no information about what you are seeing or where to go. Would be a wonderful sightseeing visit if more was done to help visitors understand.",
          "Since I am a native Luxembourger I have been here multiple times. Of course it becomes boring when you visit it too often. \n\nHowever, visiting it every few years is amazing and visiting it for the very first time even more so. You van actually experience a bit of history.\n\nJust be careful as the steps can be very narrow.",
          "Major tourist attraction in Luxembourg City, iportant part of this capital's history.",
          "Truly an impressive historical place. This place radiates energy from the past. Very beautiful",
          "Beautiful views and a reasonably informative narrative (On the train). Could do with stopping at the more interesting locations to take pictures.",
          "It\u2019s not very overwhelming but given that it\u2019s one of the few attractions in the city, one can spend a good half an hour in the underground fort. Not too far from the central station and the ticket comes for 6euros(5 for students).",
          "Fantastic views of the river valley. Tour is loosely organised, you find your way around in an organic way. Very interesting but nothing in English on the history boards so a bit limiting for my party. Wikipedia gives a good potted script worth a read. Definitely worth the visit. Approx \u20ac8/adult entry.",
          "Is fun, quite a labyrinth \ud83d\ude00",
          "This is a great place you need to visit in Luxembourg, especially in summer, you can hide here for a little bit from the heat outside.\nGreat city views on the lower City and Alzette river.\nPrice to enter: 7 euros, adult",

          "This is a pretty cool place. Not to recommend if you have a bad knee of hip or similar. I cannot image anybody having fun in there with a wheelchair \u2013 at least as far as all the stair cases are concerned. (There are bathrooms that should be \u2026",
          "If you're in Luxembourg...and you don't know what to do...and it's raining...this is the right place.",
          "A must see when you visit Luxembourg, but that is mostly because there isn't that much to do in Luxembourg city. Although the casemates might be kilometers in length throughout the city, this part is only 100-200m long. There isn't much \u2026",
          "Very impressive defenses both natural and man made.  Gives insight to Luxembourg's long safe history.  Very cool.",
          "Very stunning view a little but off the beaten track. Highly recommend if you like nice views and little peaceful towns.",
          "Really cool tour inside the rock!",
          "Best turist place of Luxembourg. Highly recommended.",
          "Nice experience. Most of the ruin are merely  tunnels leading to dead ends. The view however, from the holes in the wall are a spectacle. Only \u20ac6 entry so it was decent",
          "So fascinating! I thoroughly enjoyed it",
          "Nice if you like history and can understand what must have gone into building this. Some narrow staircases. Unfortunately very \"touristy\" dressed (spots, many signs etc...) However in some spots you do feel you are exploring and curiosity \u2026",
          "It's a must go location when in Luxembourg city.\n\nCost 7euro to get in filled with network of tunnels.",
          "We had a wonderful day exploring the castemates and surrounding area, which is very close to the centre of town. \n\nBe prepared for some walking up and down, but the views are amazingly beautiful.",
          "Fun/very historical Luxembourg landmark all should visit.  Gave only 3 because, altho one doesn't want history marred by directional signs, the \u2b07\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0fsigns for very narrow stairs need to be easier to see/ID.  The brochure map could be a bit clearer as to to where EXIT is.  Otherwise, great experience!  Thx!",
          "Nice view, must seen if you are here",
          "It was a good place as early morning it was too cold and felt warm inside. It was hidden and secret place.",
          "Take note that they're not open during winter. Check the official website for dates. Even if it's not open, you can explore around to get some pretty good views. It's amazing how integrated the casemates are with the city. Will definitely visit again.",
          "I didn't have a chance to visit the site but by the looks of its surrounding area, it should be amazing",
          "One of the main attractions of the city, a very nice place to visit and to work out after a good lunch. There are trails and tunnels into the rock. They give you a map with the rooms and tunnels but the drawing it\u2019s not helpful. From its balconies there are some great views of the city.",
          "Very nice place.",
          "It's very nice place. Don't miss it. And take map agenda before entering into tannul \ud83d\ude0a. It too confusing place. You can't come out easily. I enjoyed very lot.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\ude0a",
          "I rarely give places one star. The reason for this is because I didn't even have the opportunity to try anything. We walked in, took a little bit to be seated. After being seated no one brought us menus or said anything to us. We waited \u2026",
          "Just fantastic views!",
          "A cultural heritage of Luxembourg that is worth a visit!",
          "It is okay, not too much to see and do except for a few viewpoints and some renovated rubble. The viewpoint on top is free and is even better. \nFor younger kids this is not a recommendation! They will get very bored and there is nothing to entertain them with here :(\n\nWhat I do recommend is walk beneath one of the bridges, way cooler!",
          "Be aware the place is closed for long periods. My kids were very disappointed. Open in Spring?!",
          "Love the experience, although the place is not that big and the entrance hard to find",
          "Amazing place to visit... great views",
          "It's not worth 6 euro's to be honest",
          "Definitely not the coolest thing we saw in the city. Perhaps would've been better with a guide. Excellent views though.",
          "Very interesting place to see. Might be a bit triggering for those with claustrophobia in some places but there is a nice view on the city from that point. I'm giving 4/5 for the price to quality ratio. Overall, good experience and would recommend it to others visiting Luxembourg.",
          "One of the must do tourist attractions here. If you do the full length of the tunnels and move between the different levels it can be quite tiring. Some good views from the openings in the walls.",
          "Neverending ways and corners, very interesting",
          "This is a special attraction because of the historic importance, but is quite disappointing. It was recognized as UNESCO world heritage site was built first in 1644 and is stretched 23 km long. Actually this is an underground fortress used \u2026",
          "A view across the valley is absolutely a must for any tourist. Steeped in history this is the ultimate place to stretch your legs and do a bit of a walkabout. I do envy the people who actually live in this valley.",
          "I am not satisfied with the visit, I expected something more than just galleries to walk through. Although, the sights are amazing you can enjoy them from the top of the bridge. Therefore, in my opinion a 7 euros ticket is expensive",
          "Wow what a place.The monk in olden days did lot of work n drank lot more wine",
          "Not a lot of information on display and pretty much all the same. Tunnels and firing holes dug out of rock.",
          "The tunnels were closed when I was there but the fall colors were lovely and the green spaces wonderful.",
          "Fun for 30mins.  But no exhibition.  Just a few windows to look out from",
          "Beautiful place with beautiful views. A lot of history hidden under. A must visit place in Luxembourg. Would have been more better if it had an audio tour.",
          "Nice panoramic view of the river surrounding  Luxembourg. The casemates were closed however...",
          "Nice place to visit, but I do not recommend the guided tour at all. It's in German and English at the same time and the tour guide only explained 40% of the things in English",
          "Easily located via buses going in and out of the centre.\n\nBit on the pricey side but it's Luxembourg so it's to be expected.\n\nGet here early in the day to avoid school groups.\n\nBeautiful views of the valley below and amazing landscapes.",
          "They charge 6 Euros for entry, and for the first 10 minutes it's interesting. All you see is the same view without anything interesting in the actual cave part. Don't recommend it",
          "A very easily accessible piece of history!",
          "The view in this place is breathtaking. A perfect spot of a love story in the making \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0a",
          "Very impressive tunnel circuits.",
          "This is a 'must visit' place in Luxembourg. Ticket price is \u20ac6. Place is awesome. Read a bit before going. Guided tour would have been better, but I didn't see any guide around.",
          "Nice to see but could be done better. (The guys in Maastricht, for example, do know how to present this sort of stuff.)\n\nGood views though!",
          "Certainly go here if your are in town!",
          "It's got all the charm of a bunker, with the stunning view of a watch tower. No wonder the Spaniards commissioned its construction in the 17th century.\nNot recommended to people with weak knees, this place has a lot of stairs.",
          "Casemates of Bock is a 23-km underground gallery which took place 40 years later after building it in 1644. Later, it was reduced to 17 km in 1867. The museum showcases a defense system dug up to 40 m deep and was listed in the World Heritage List. One of the top thinga to do in Leuxembourg.",
          "Alot bigger then I thought it would be.",
          "Fascinating! Try to catch a tour. If not, take a tour by yourself. History is incredible.",
          "Such a nice heritage centre must watch once in ur lyf tym",
          "Interesting spot, great views into the valley.",
          "Great attraction and very interesting.\nThe leaflet they give you when you enter tells you all you need to know.\nNot for the claustrophobic (dark, low, long tunnels) or the unstable (narrow spiral staircases).\nWell worth the ticket price.",
          "Very interesting place where you can make many photos",
          "A very interesting tourist attraction. It looks like just a dungeon in the mountains at the first sight. However, once you start exploring it, it becomes more and more interesting. In addition, it is also quite a good workout if you truly explored every corner of the site.",
          "Interesting place but I was expecting more. More information about events and the history would have been nice",
          "I didn't go inside the tunnels but looks amazing from the outside so much history.",
          "Nice place..  Relaxed..  Green..",
          "Incredible view of the city! Lots of small streets and a different perspective of the valle on each corner.",
          "A Warren of tunnels and stairs cases hidden inside a wall what more can I say if you love exploring and history then why are you reading this and not in the queue to get in !",
          "Pretty cool place. We didn't do a guided tour but wished we had.  Not for anyone with claustrophobia.",
          "It's cool but gets repetitive. Too many dead ends.",
          "A must visit attraction in this charming Luxembourg. The casemates, and its extended route from the casemate, give us total view of the amazing valley. Beautiful, charming, peaceful path with layers of the walls, its accompanied nature \u2026",
          "Its a very beautiful place",
          "This was amazing, tunnelled to protect the city",
          "Super cool and historical.",
          "It's quite lovely nice & beautiful casement du bock is a place I recommend",
          "nice view place for sighting. It's a beautiful hilly city and needs lots of climbing...",
          "Cool place to ponder",
          "It's very interesting place to visit in the city centre. However you cannot go with the pram. And they should add more historic items to create better atmosphere",
          "An incredible historical journey.",
          "It is very nice to see in here.",
          "Interesting spot, way bigger than expected from outside. I really recommend it.",
          "Beautiful area. To hard to recommend any particular place just go and explore",
          "Excellent cave system to explore",
          "Really neat place with lots of tunnels to explore. I wish there was a bit more explanation of what the various tunnels and chambers were used for, though. Cheap entry fee with historical info in German and French.",
          "loved the place \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
          "Amazing tunnels through the rock in Luxembourg. Very cheap and definitely worth the money. There's a huge length of tunnel and many viewing spots. Some parts are very deep and dark. You have to be careful when you go down a staircase because some are very long and seem to never end!",
          "Piece of lux history ...worth peeking in",
          "Nice place to explore",
          "Nice leisure activity in Luxembourg!",
          "Absolutely stunning views from a historical site that gives panoramic aspects of the Duchy.",
          "Interesring to see, but nothing special.",
          "Cool \ud83d\ude0e very historical place",
          "Must see!! But beware of step and narrow staircases inside.",
          "Nice place to walk around",
          "It is so interesting to visit to learn more about history and it provides great view of the city as well.",
          "Great fun in the city!",
          "Good views, but all the information is in French",
          "It has awesome views, the catacombs and is also the start of the walks for the walls and turrets.",
          "A glimpse of history. Worth the visit",
          "Ome can enjoy really nice views here.",
          "If you're going to go here, be prepared for a lot of climbing. Be careful when going up or down the stairs as they're slanted. Bring a torch (or phone flashlight) and remember where you've been. It will make leaving easier. It's quite easy to get lost here, there are a lot of dead ends. ",
          "One of the many beautiful rock fortifications in city",
          "Is so beautiful \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d",
          "If you get lost dont jump out the window. Not a good idea. Great last view though if you do",
          "This place is a UNESCO World Heritage site. It's so cool and you absolutely should do it if visiting Luxembourg. It's an impenetrable fortress built into the mountain. It was a great defense for the city. ",
          "They don't build holes like they used to",
          "Great place to learn some history. Unfortunately the guided tour could have been better and cheaper but overall it was a great place to visit.",
          "Really nice place \u2764\ufe0f you can use the bimmelbahn \ud83d\ude82 for exploring the area around",
          "Nice historical site near the centre. Well worth a visit for some great views of the city. Self guided and can spend as much or little time in the Bock as you want. Bring a coat on wet or windy days as it gets very drafty.",
          "Really nice experience. Its basically a cave with many paths. If you are not into it is better not to go. However i loved the experience, the view is great and its a big area down there.",
          "Lovely place to visit if you like fortifications. In some areas it can get a bit dark and narrow, but I think that adds to the charm. Great views of the city. ",
          "Nice place to have a walk and learn more about Luxembourg's history.",
          "I was very amazed by the historical significance of this place to Luxembourg.  It was like being in a live museum.",
          "beautiful views of Luxembourg, interesting history on a small train/ bus ride through the city!!!",
          "Even the tunnels where designed as fortress, thanks to colourful lightning and breathtaking views on the lower city a visit leaves a positive feeling.",
          "A great journey into Luxembourg history.  Unfortunately the exhibits are not in English, like most of the museums in Luxembourg.",
          "so cool! Get the Luxembourg card!",
          "Very nice view.",
          "Really neat to see, not many signs to tell you where to go and how to get get out",
          "Closed for the winter.",
          "The best place to be in Luxembourg city. True to its name: a world heritage, it has the best views of the city from various points and also has a lot of history associated with it which is explained in the brochure.",
          "I didn't like it. It's a short visit with nothing really interesting to see.",
          "Great view. Compatible for Walking with kids",
          "Beautiful scenery and lovely walk. Been to Luxembourg before and wish we'd gone here sooner.",
          "Fascinating layers of Luxembourg & European history in one small area - skillfully and entertainingly explained.",
          "I enjoyed this site. You can explore it for a few Euros.",
          "Interesting history with unique views of the city. The self guided tour could be improved upon with a better map showing the flow of the tour. If you have the time, the guided tour is the way to go.",
          "Looks nice from outside, but was closed for visitors",
          "Amazing view.",
          "Beautiful site - mysterious galleries deep into the big rocks where you might meet the beautiful and almost (she's got a fishtail, it's true) stark-naked Melusina brushing her hair. People say  it's a legend, but it isn't! Believe me!",
          "Thanks caves were fun to visit but difficult to exit hahaha which caused a slight panic but the experience was great! Very cool.",
          "Fun few hours to tour and nice sights!",
          "Its alright. You have some nice views, but it is a lot of the same.",
          "Small church but it started with the city foundation since 10th century.",
          "You have to pay to go inside, there is no guided visit for knowing the place, I won't say that is a place to know, it's better if you can go outside the city, this is a small place that can be taken in 20 min without anything exciting.",
          "Interesting overall. Some sections can be claustrofobic for some people. One section was closed to public.",
          "Beatiful history",
          "Amazing view and historical site. You absolutely cannot miss it if visiting Luxembourg City. Walk around, explore and enjoy the stroll.",
          "Maybe, the best place to see in Luxembourg. Truly amazing, ticket is 6 EUR.",
          "Beautiful and centrally located. Parking was easy to find and lots to see",
          "Pretty cool.  Lots and lots of walking.  Be prepared to climb a ton of stairs if you want to do the whole thing",
          "It is an interesting historical construction but as a visitor all you have are confusing signs and plain caves with nothing to see. Some of the openings on the side do provide nice views.",
          "Interesting place with a large history but you need a guided tour to appreciate what you see.",
          "Interesting place to walk through",
          "Beautiful, worth paying for the guided tour!",
          "This was fun... I enjoyed getting lost in here as the exit was not straightforward ... Kind of mazey :)",
          "Interesting casemates, but unfortunately the information they provide is so minimalistic that it's hardly worth visiting as-is. And this although there's so much potential to make incredibly interesting exhibits out of it!",
          "Fascinating historical attraction but be careful when your walking through!",
          "Interesting place to visit. With a clear paper with a map and information in several languages!",
          "Great place near city center",
          "Amazing network of tunnels and fortifications overlooking Luxembourgh city.",
          "Beautiful",
          "Great place to visit",
          "Really cool place. Must see if you are in the area. It's amazing how they've built a city around this fortified fortress",
          "A brisk 10 minute walk from the town center. A very good place to view the old city defenses. UNESCO World Heritage Site. Tricky stairs - not wheelchair accessible. \u20ac4 per adult, definitely worth it.",
          "Very cheap attraction with lots of great views. I highly recommend this to anyone who's able-bodied and interested in Luxembourg and/or history. If you're claustrophobic or afraid of dark/dim spaces or ominous, narrow, perhaps never-ending stairways, consider avoiding this one.",
          "6 euro to wander around an old defensive structure. No signs and explanations bords. You will get lost and many many stairs and steps. Worth it? Mwah... Should have cost less in my opinion.",
          "It's the insides of a ruined fort. Nice views. Wear good shoes and be prepared to do a lot of walking!",
          "A true experience in particular when there are not too many fellow tourists in the Casemates. There are tunnels towards the end that might make you a little claustrophobic and there are stairs that are so slanted that you will easily slip. Views are very scenic and walking the tunnels catapults you back in time.",
          "Interesting caves but easy to get misled",
          "Lovely views of this place from any angle. Never really did much else other than walk past it. It is very picturesque though.",
          "Great place. Free with a Luxembourg card from the tourist office. I got lost because it's a bit maze like but unique place to visit.",
          "It's a UNESCO world heritage site and it was used for military purposes. Now it's just ruins and tunnels. I don't recommend for small kids/elderly people/people with mobility restrictions as you need to walk through irregular floor and go up and down through narrow stairs.",
          "Beautiful, fascinating history. Well worth the admission price to explore inside.",
          "Nice views of the city and fun to explore. Worth the entrance price.",
          "The information is spars. Could be better",
          "Must visit place if you are in Luxembourg. The entrance is quite cheap, you won't regret it!",
          "Really nice exprerience , very well organized and with a great view to the city. I would strongly recommend!",
          "To be seen. A nice piece of history here in Luxembourg",
          "Could get lost in this place",
          "Take the tourist train (45min) and you can see a lot. The traffic is sometimes busy so this is a good option. Sit back and relax.",
          "A really interesting series of tunnels with fantastic views of Luxembourg.  Some small quibbles:  The signposting down in the tunnels is difficult to follow.  You end up traipsing up and down spiral staircases, not sure where you are going. \u2026",
          "Fantastic view of the city. \u20ac6 per person. Some tight spaces and stairs. Can be dark in some places so watch your step. Worth the visit. ",
          "Gives you the amazing tour inside of the fortress where people used to hide during the war times.",
          "You can see why this is called the Inland Gibraltar. The panoramic views from Casemates Du Bock of the city surrounds are stunning. You'll get your moneys worth with a selfie stick and your mobile phone camera.",
          "Again, stunning views and I would recommend it to anyone...",
          "Really interesting part of the history of Luxemburg city. It still shows the signs of military power. I advise to check it out",
          "Interesting. I did the guided tour but a big chunk of the explanation was about the internet speed in Luxembourg more than of the history of the country.",
          "Really happy that I was there. One thing that was not so easy to find was a parking lot.",
          "Admission 6 euro.\nGood long opening hours. Closes 830pm\nLots of stairs but not needed to see the main gallery. \nLots of little balconies/lookouts.\nI imagine it would be nice at blue hour for photos. It was raining when we went.\n4 stars as I \u2026",
          "Good place if you like old caves/castles not that much to look but interresting, not for old/handicaped people",
          "Interesting area, but expected to see more inside. Most rooms are empty. Read up on the area before you go. Be prepared for lots of stairs.",
          "The city 's valleys are really nice and this place makes no exception",
          "Interesting experience in Lux!",
          "Well worth a visit",
          "Amazing \ud83d\ude0d",
          "less interesting than I thought. Still nice to visit when being in Luxemburg City.",
          "I had a very nice few days in Luxembourg. Walks around the Casemates du Bock offer beautiful views.",
          "An old part of old city reinforcement in the historical Old City - a very nice tour to add to a relaxed city walk. Pleasant walk in the defence rioms carved out in a mountain, quite a few openungs on bith sides provide fantastic views on city valley.",
          "It is a very nice experience walking in the castle tunnels but everything is written in German or French. Nothing in English.",
          "Very interesting. Worth seeing.",
          "Interesting place to visit while in Luxembourg downtown",
          "Pretty fun for a kid to feel like they're in the real life Minecraft comic or in a tomb in Skyrim. Be warned there are many many stairs, but that's part of the fun! No strollers or wheelchairs allowed due to the stairs, but they will let you leave your stroller at the entrance.",
          "Wonderful experience. I wandered inside the underground hallway. Interesting.",
          "A maze of tunnels that offer awesome views of the city below",
          "You get to view the city under another perspective.",
          "Fascinating place.",
          "It is nice",
          "Interesting to walk through",
          "Unique experience with interesting history behind these casemates.",
          "Preserved well historical cite and awesome natural view surrounded",
          "Can spend a whole day there but you can also get the highlights in about an hour.",
          "Quite fascinating at the beginning but more or less all the same. It is not Rome but it is worth a visit.",
          "I was surprised how large the site actually is. Very impressive. I highly recommend this visit ",
          "It was ok. From the Windows down you can get some decent views.",
          "Was nice and interesting. But i think what would make it truly interesting is the stories that go with it. But for that you need a tour.",
          "Not loads of things to see but it was interesting",
          "Nice historical place",
          "Guided tour is not worth it. But it's a nice place to spend afternoon",
          "Lovely place",
          "A unique place. A few years ago, a run went along one of the tunnels. The only experience of the kind in my 40+ years of running.",
          "fantastic ... luxembourg's finest ... everytime a lovely experience to wander around that area",
          "Not too exciting but interesting",
          "A very nice place to visit. A maze of alleys form which you can have a spectacular view on the city",
          "A walk in history along the cave/bunkers of Luxembourg.",
          "It's both historic & scenic.",
          "Nice place",
          "Nice place to walk around in the middle of Luxembourg, very calm and relaxing atmosphere",
          "Interesting historic place. Good place to learn about the history of Luxembourg. The place is an Unesco WHS",
          "Very interesting and historic part of town. Just be aware that the information signs are only in German and French if you are hoping to learn anything specific.",
          "It loeuk lik cawill 0f duiteiy mop koock oof u coppiey point du hock fram cod",
          "Must do attraction.\nThis old defensive pathways are chopped in the rocks, it has probably be an immense job to create them.\nYou can wander around them for a small fee, it's cool inside on a hot summer day and the circular walk actually starts inside.",
          "It's an interesting place to a point but it's all a bit samey. Good for cooling down on a hot day or staying out of tge rain but this could be so much better with a bit of imagination from the owners.",
          "Great view both frommtge bridge and down below from the canon ports and windows. Guided tour is great if you are interested in history.",
          "Nice view",
          "Definitely worth a look. Pretty cool to see how cities were fortified previously .",
          "OK place but the ticket price was a bit too high. I would have wanted English descriptions about the history of the place.",
          "It was nice seen where military drills are performed underground and civilians are kept save in thousands during wars, its a place worth visiting.",
          "amazing place",
          "Capture the essence of the old fortress",

        "wiki": "Greater Region (French: Grande R\u00e9gion, German: Gro\u00dfregion, Luxembourgish: Groussregioun) is the area of Saarland, Lorraine, Luxembourg, Rhineland-Palatinate, Wallonia and the rest of the French Community of Belgium, and the German-speaking Community of Belgium. It is not identical with the SaarLorLux Euroregion, despite being in the same territory.It is situated between the Rhine, Moselle, Saar and Meuse rivers, has an overall area of 65,401 km\u00b2. Its population counts 11.2 million inhabitants, representing 2.5% of the total population of the 27-state European Union, and accounting for the same proportion of the EU GDP.\nThe Greater Region is divided between Romance and Germanic languages and also forms the hub for transport in Europe. It has an urban, rural (Ardennes-Eifel-Rheinhessen) and industrial fabric which is the source of rich and ongoing economic and cultural relations.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe size of the Greater Region is more than 400 km from East to West and more than 350 km from North to South.\n\"11.2 Millions of people live in the Greater Region; this is corresponding to 3% of the total population of the 15 European Union member states. In the same dimension the Greater Region contributes to the gross domestic product of the community. (...) All four member states are faced with economic challenges, being subject to changes in their industrial and mining industries. So they create a certain syndicate to cope with these problems, like the \"European Development Pool of the sectors Longwy (France), Rodange (Luxembourg), Athus (Belgium)\". \n\n\n== European Capital of Culture ==\nIn 2007 Luxembourg and the Greater Region, together with city of Sibiu, Romania, were designated by the European Union for a period of one year to be the European Capital of Culture, during which they were given a chance to showcase their cultural life and cultural development. \n\n\n== Museums and temporary exhibitions ==\nIn the Greater Region more than 1,200 museums and other institutions present and conserve the heritage of this core European region. \n\n\n== History ==\nThe history of the Greater Region and its subdivisions is a mirror of the History of Europe starting from the prehistory up to the current European history. Outstanding testimonials of all European eras can be retrieved in the area of the Greater Region. Due to the Romanization during ancient Roman times and the invasion of the Germanic people during the Late Antiquity, the Greater Region became a threshold region up today. Hence the cultural, historical, political, economical and social inhomogeneities shape the region and its inhabitants until today. Several wars, like the Four Lords' War, and foremost World War I with the Battle of Verdun and World War II with the Battle of the Bulge, the Maginot Line and the Siegfried Line devastated the region. Today, peaceful forms of coexistence, like the numerous cross-border commuters, may be seen. \n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThe Greater Region contains many interesting tourist destinations. In general, they can be reached in day trips from any starting point within the Greater Region. The following are the major tourist destinations in the area:\n\nSarreguemines (France), with the famous Fa\u00efencerie (earthenware factory)\nSaverne (France), with the Saint-Louis-Arzviller inclined plane\nBitche (France), one of  Vauban\u2019s garrison towns with a large citadel; one of the largest underground artillery works of the Maginot Line (Fort Simserhof), can be visited\nMetz (France), capital of the Lorraine region with the high  Gothic Metz Cathedral (with windows of Hermann von M\u00fcnster and Marc Chagall) and the new branch of the Centre Pompidou-Metz\nNancy (France), Art Nouveau city with Place Stanislas (UNESCO World Heritage Sites)\nSaarbr\u00fccken, capital of the German state of Saarland, with the baroque Ludwigskirche, which is the burial location of Elisabeth of Lorraine\nV\u00f6lklingen (Saarland), the V\u00f6lklingen Ironworks (UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site)\nTrier (Rhineland-Palatinate), ancient Roman city with many Roman monuments, the most famous of which is Porta Nigra\nMainz (capital of the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate), founded by the Romans as a military post; has the Mainz Cathedral and Gutenberg Museum\nLuxembourg (capital of Luxembourg), with medieval fortifications and Grand Ducal Palace\nLi\u00e8ge (Belgium) cultural center of Wallonia with the palace of the Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge and Baroque Town Hall\n\n\n== Interreg program ==\nThe Greater Region is supported by Interreg III, a Community initiative which aims to stimulate interregional cooperation in the EU between 2000-06. It is financed under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).\nThis phase of the Interreg initiative is designed to strengthen economic and social cohesion throughout the EU, by fostering the balanced development of the continent through cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation.The current INTERREG IV A Greater Region (Grande R\u00e9gion) programme (period 2007 - 2013) has been elaborated to enforce the cooperation between the project partners from the different parts of the Greater Region.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "A very rare opportunity to see virtually the entire workings of a mid 20th century iron producing factory. You can walk from the bottom floor up through many floors to nearly the very top and look out over the works and of course the town of V\u00f6lklingen.",
          "Amazing place, difficult to describe how vast this place is.  If you are into industrial heritage this is a must.  Ensure you take drinks and food with you as there is little in the way of refreshments once inside and finding them can be a challenge.",

          "Impressive location!! Incredible to see how people worked decades ago. Always worth a visit MN perfect location for expositions.",
          "The scale, the colours, fall out landscape,the history, the silent beauty of an abandoned industrial site. Just because it's no longer in use does not mean it has to be torn down as proved here. Open the space to the public, preserve the history, use the space imaginatively for art and music theatre etc.",

          "Very interesting, huge site. Scaling the heights of the blast furnaces is quite scary as the stairs are open to the sides. Steam engine hall is superb and often has cultural exhibitions. Easy to get to by train.",
          "Very interesting place. All those rusty pipes and old walls report the history of a heavy industry that was dominant at a certain time in that region.",
          "Amazing place to visit. A must if you are in the area. We had a 5 year old with us and spent 5 hours there. 40 minutes of which were spent trying to find the start of the roundwalk. Signs and indications could be better, we've seen several people walking in the wrong direction totally lost.",
          "This place is fascinating if you like industrial stuff. The tour guides are very knowledgeable and they can share a lot about the history of the place.

I would return in a heartbeat, and I may just to take more photographs.",

        "wiki": "Ouvrage M\u00e9trich located in the village of K\u0153nigsmacker in Moselle, comprises part of the Elzange portion of the Fortified Sector of Thionville of the Maginot Line. A gros ouvrage, it is the third largest of the Line, after  Hackenberg and Hochwald. It lies between petit ouvrage Sentzich and gros ouvrage Billig, facing Germany. Located to the east of the Moselle, it cooperated with Ouvrage Galgenberg to control the river valley.\n\n\n== Design and construction ==\nM\u00e9trich was approved for construction by CORF (Commission d'Organisation des R\u00e9gions Fortifi\u00e9es), the Maginot Line's design and construction agency, in November 1930 and became operational by 1935, at a cost of 127 million francs. The contractor was Construction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n\n\n== Description ==\nM\u00e9trich is a typical large Maginot gros ouvrage with separate ammunition and personnel entry blocks. It has a particularly heavy artillery component, with seven 75mm guns, two 135mm guns and four 81mm mortars, making it the third most heavily armed unit in the Maginot Line.  More than 1,200 metres (3,900 ft) of underground galleries connect the entries to the farthest blocks 4 and 5, at an average depth of 30 metres (98 ft). An \"M1\" magazine, arranged with a horseshoe-shaped perimeter gallery connected by cross galleries between the legs, is located close to the ammunition entrance, while the underground barracks and utility areas are just inside the personnel entry. The gallery system was served by a narrow-gauge (60 cm) railway that continued out the ammunition entry and connected to a regional military railway system for the movement of materiel along the front a few kilometers to the rear. Several \"stations\" along the gallery system, located in wider sections of gallery, permitted trains to pass or be stored. Several 60 cm wagons, which had remained at M\u00e9trich, were recovered in 1983 and were moved to the Maginot museum at Ouvrage Schoenenbourg.Ouvrage M\u00e9trich comprises two entries and ten combat blocks:\n\nAmmunition entry: at-grade, one machine gun/37mm anti-tank gun embrasure (JM/AC37), one machine gun embrasure (JM), and two automatic rifle cloches (GFM).\nPersonnel entry: gently descending from the entry, one JM/AC37 embrasure, one JM embrasure, and two GFM cloches.\nBlock 1: Artillery block flanking to the north with three 75mm gun embrasures and two GFM cloches.\nBlock 3: Infantry block flanking to the north with one machine gun turret, one JM/AC37 embrasure, one JM embrasure and one GFM cloche\nBlock 4: Infantry block with one machine gun turret\nBlock 5: Artillery block with on 81mm mortar turret and two GFM cloches\nBlock 7: Observation block with one GFM cloche and one VDP periscope cloche.\nBlock 8: Mixed block with one 75mm gun turret, one JM/AC37 embrasure, one JM embrasure and two GFM cloches\nBlock 10: Artillery block with one 75mm gun terret and one grenade launcher turret (LG).\nBlock 11: Artillery block with one 135mm gun turret, one grenade launcher turret and one GFM cloche.\nBlock 14: Observation block with two GFM cloches and one periscope cloche (VDP).\nBlock 15: Artillery block with two 81mm mortar embrasures and two GFM cloches.Due to the depth of the main galleries under the height of the M\u00e9trich hill, Blocks 8 and 11 are linked by a gallery at an intermediate level, containing an \"M2\" magazine. An intermediate level under Block 7 contains the command post.\n\n\n=== Casemates and shelters ===\nM\u00e9trich was associated with a number of smaller fortifications. These included:\n\nCasemate  de Koenigsmacker Nord: one JM/AC37 embrasure, one JM embrasure, one GFM cloche\nCasemate de Koenigsmacker Sud: one JM/AC37 embrasure, one JM embrasure, one GFM cloche\nCasemate de M\u00e9trich Nord: one JM/AC47 embrasure, one JM embrasure, one GFM cloche\nCasemate de M\u00e9trich Sud: one JM/AC47 embrasure, one JM embrasure, one GFM cloche\nAbri du Krekelbusch: buried infantry shelter for two sections, with one GFM cloche\nAbri Sud de M\u00e9trich: buried infantry shelter for one section, with two GFM cloches\nAbri du Nonnenberg: buried infantry shelter for one section, with two GFM cloches\nAbri du Nord-du-Bichel: surface infantry shelter for one section, with two GFM cloches\nCasemate du Bois-de-Koenigsmacker: one JM/AC37 embrasure, one JM embrasure, two GFM cloches\nAbri du Sud-du-Bichel: surface infantry shelter for one section, with two GFM cloches, in the process of restoration.None of these are connected to the ouvrage or to each other. All were built by CORF.\n\n\n== Manning ==\nThe ouvrage was manned by 795 men and 26 officers under the command of Commandant Lauga. The Casernement d'Elzange provided peacetime above-ground barracks and support services to Bois-Karre and other ouvrages in the area.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSee Fortified Sector of Thionville for a broader discussion of the events of 1940 in the Thionville sector of the Maginot Line.The principal mission of the ouvrage was to cover the east side of the Moselle valley. In 1940 German forces largely bypassed the Moselle, enveloping Thionville from the rear.  M\u00e9trich and other ouvrages in the Thionville sector therefore surrendered after the Second Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne of 22 June. During the Occupation support areas of the ouvrage were transformed by German occupiers into offices and manufacturing facilities. Some of the combat blocks were used by the Germans for testing of explosives. In 1944 M\u00e9trich was held by the  74th Volksgrenadier Regiment of the 19th Volksgrenadier Division. M\u00e9trich was attacked on 10 November 1944 by the U.S. 90th Infantry Division advancing around he north side of Thionville. After an initial retreat, German resistance was strong. A second, cautious assault was launched on the 11th, and when the ouvrage had been surrounded the main force bypassed the position, leaving a holding force to clear the German defenses, where resistance ended on the 12th.Following the war, the Maginot Line was viewed as a means of slowing an advance by Warsaw Pact forces and most of the northeastern positions were renovated and rearmed.  The renovations did not include the command post or the barracks.   However, the program was abandoned, and after a period of routine maintenance, M\u00e9trich's status was lowered to inactive reserve, and finally abandoned.\n\n\n== Current condition ==\nM\u00e9trich has been stripped of all materials by salvagers and vandals. The ouvrage is in a state of advanced dilapidation, primarily because the soil is composed of gypsum, causing the destruction of the floors and walls of the galleries.  Magazine M1 was used for the cultivation of mushrooms in 1986-87. The entries and blocks with embrasures have been covered with rubble by the Army.The Abri du Sud-du-Bichel is being restored by the Association m\u00e9moire des intervalles de la Ligne Maginot.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of all works on Maginot Line\nSiegfried Line\nAtlantic Wall\nCzechoslovak border fortifications\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAllcorn, William.

          "Our teenagers were deeply impressed by our visit to this underground fort. The guide in English was very good. Would strongly recommend this - note the opening hours are only 2-3.30pm. Access by car. It's a little remote but there is good signposting which we could easily",
          "Make no mistake, you will be going into an underground fortress. Parts will be cold, parts will be dark. But all of it will be awesome! We waited for the English tour and had no problem understanding anything. Being able to see the history and hearing the stories of this",
          "We came here hoping to do one of the tours, but they do not start until 2:30 in the afternoon and we could not wait around that long. We did explore the grounds and chapel by ourselves, which was still informative. I would love to go back though and actually see inside the",
          "This attraction is worth every penny. Both myself and my husband enjoyed our visit here. It is worth knowing to turn up for 14.00 as the visitors are divided into groups for the tour and we had a friendly English speaking guide who was very knowledgeable about the fortress. It",
          "I went with a group of people and had a great time. I studied history in college so this was great for me. We had a tour guide who spoke English and she was very helpful. I really enjoyed going on the roof and watching them operate the turret. Definitely worth seeing.",
          "A jewel of a historical fort in the middle of nowhere France. First leave early to try and find it. Look at the driving directions on the website. We toured on a weekday and had an excellent English speaking guide. There is an extensive collection of arms and uniforms in the",
          "If you can manage it, you must visit this place. They have 'refurbished' the fort and you can go through on foot and on small rail cars to have a look at it - it's huge and all under ground. There are 10 kilometres of tunnels with dormitories, kitchens, hospitals, ammunition",
          "I emailed for a tour and was told we could join the English group. When we arrived we were placed in a French speaking group with pieces of laminated paper. It's very dark inside and difficult to read the information given. Luckily we had a flashlight and finished reading the",
          "Extensive 2 hour tour through the still mostly functional underground complex. The only minus is that the tour was in French. They do have an english translation available on a card but you either have to read up on it before or after having been there if you french isn't up to",
          "From the 10km underground train tour to demo of the working gun parts and dressed mannequin staged rooms such as the kitchen, our family was fascinated. It's all the more special because it's a state unfounded white elephant (enormously expensive to build but failed",
          "A huge underground complex is what the Hackenberg Ouvrage is, complete with an electric train to one of the buried howitzer positions. There are loads of preserved weapons, tanks, uniforms to feast your eyes upon, but what really takes your breath away is the stupidity and",
          "the visit is interesting. it give you a sense of what was going on prior to the invasion. the whole area is full of historic sites, from both world wars",
          "This fortress has to be visited by an official tour. You cannot enter alone and when you see it you will know why. The tour lasts over 2 hours and is almost underground. There are tours in French, English or German. Your choice which one. The fortress goes on forever",
          "i loved everything about the attraction and it was the main purpose for this trip, The only issue was the fact that the fort is manned by volunteers: this does not detract from the experience at all, you just have to check on the opening days/times etc before you go. We went on",
          "This place is HUGE!! The tour guides are volunteers so the fort isn't open everyday and they make one guided tour a day. You must visit with a guide. There was an older gentleman in a wheel chair and other than the brief outside tour of the turret (about 15 minutes with maybe 50",

          "Great tour guides, very well run tours. An amazing piece of history. An amazing view into a fascinating concept and time. Well worth the visit",
          "I will admit, this is not going to be for everyone. While I am a bit of a history buff and my wife will join me on these sort of jaunts, I did take this tour while I was running solo in Europe on business. The Hackenberg complex is massive and packed with outstanding displays.",
          "If you are interested in WW1 and the measures France took in order to avoid another invasion, you probably know the Maginot Line. If you don't care, but still like to see something different, go to this place. You are taken by a small train underground to see how an underground",

          "The Maginot Line. I knew very little about it. You walk and take a train through long underground passages, originally designed to defend France on the German border. Tours are guided and last about 2.5 hours with no bathroom facilities except at the beginning. Tours are run in"

Amazing engineering through the tunnels and working demonstrations of the gun machinery. A visit that kept on giving! Highly recommend."

        "wiki": "Lucia of Syracuse (283\u2013304), also called Saint Lucia (Latin: Sancta Lucia) or Saint Lucy, was a Christian martyr who died during the Diocletianic Persecution. She is venerated as a saint in the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, and Eastern Orthodox churches. She is one of eight women (including Saint Mary) explicitly commemorated by Roman Catholics in the Canon of the Mass. Her traditional feast day, known in Europe as Saint Lucia's Day, is observed by Western Christians on 13 December. Lucia of Syracuse was honored in the Middle Ages and remained a well-known saint in early modern England.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nThe oldest record of her story comes from the fifth-century Acts of the Martyrs.  The single fact upon which various accounts agree is that a disappointed suitor accused Lucy of being a Christian, and she was executed in Syracuse, Sicily, in the year 304 during the Diocletianic Persecution.  Her veneration spread to Rome, and by the sixth century to the whole Church.  The oldest archaeological evidence comes from the Greek inscriptions from the Catacombs of St. John in Syracuse. Jacobus de Voragine's Legenda Aurea was the most widely read version of the Lucy legend in the Middle Ages.  In medieval accounts, Saint Lucy's eyes were gouged out prior to her execution.\n\n\n== Life ==\nAll the details of her life are the conventional ones associated with female martyrs of the early fourth century. John Henry Blunt views her story as a Christian romance similar to the Acts of other virgin martyrs.According to the traditional story, Lucy was born of rich and noble parents about the year 283. Her father was of Roman origin, but died when she was five years old, leaving Lucy and her mother without a protective guardian. Her mother's name Eutychia seems to indicate that she came from a Greek background.Like many of the early martyrs, Lucy had consecrated her virginity to God, and she hoped to distribute her dowry to the poor. However, Eutychia, not knowing of Lucy's promise, and suffering from a bleeding disorder, feared for Lucy's future. She arranged Lucy's marriage to a young man of a wealthy pagan family.\n\nSaint Agatha had been martyred 52 years before during the Decian persecution.  Her shrine at Catania, less than 50 miles from Syracuse attracted a number of pilgrims; many miracles were reported to have happened through her intercession.  Eutychia was persuaded to make a pilgrimage to Catania, in hopes of a cure.  While there, St. Agatha came to Lucy in a dream and told her that because of her faith her mother would be cured and that Lucy would be the glory of Syracuse, as she was of Catania.  With her mother cured, Lucy took the opportunity to persuade her mother to allow her to distribute a great part of her riches among the poor.Eutychia suggested that the sums would make a good bequest, but Lucy countered, \"...whatever you give away at death for the Lord's sake you give because you cannot take it with you.  Give now to the true Savior, while you are healthy, whatever you intended to give away at your death.\"News that the patrimony and jewels were being distributed came to Lucy's betrothed, who denounced her to Paschasius, the Governor of Syracuse. Paschasius ordered her to burn a sacrifice to the emperor's image. When she refused Paschasius sentenced her to be defiled in a brothel.\nThe Christian tradition states that when the guards came to take her away, they could not move her even when they hitched her to a team of oxen.  Bundles of wood were then heaped about her and set on fire, but would not burn.  Finally, she met her death by the sword thrust into her throat.\n\nAbsent in the early narratives and traditions, at least until the fifteenth century, is the story of Lucia tortured by eye-gouging.  According to later accounts, before she died she foretold the punishment of Paschasius and the speedy end of the persecution, adding that Diocletian would reign no more, and Maximian would meet his end.  This so angered Paschasius that he ordered the guards to remove her eyes.  Another version has Lucy taking her own eyes out in order to discourage a persistent suitor who admired them.  This is one of the reasons that Lucy is the patron saint of those with eye illnesses.  When her body was prepared for burial in the family mausoleum it was discovered that her eyes had been miraculously restored.\n\n\n== Veneration ==\nBy the sixth century, her story was sufficiently widespread that she appears in the Sacramentary of Pope Gregory I. She is also commemorated in the ancient Roman Martyrology. St. Aldhelm (English, died in 709) and later the Venerable Bede (English, died in 735) attest that her popularity had already spread to England, where her festival was kept in England until the Protestant Reformation, as a holy day of the second rank, in which no work but tillage or the like was allowed.Sigebert of Gembloux wrote a mid-eleventh century passio, to support a local cult of Lucy at Metz.The General Roman Calendar formerly had a commemoration of Saints Lucy and Geminianus on 16 September. This was removed in 1969, as a duplication of the feast of her dies natalis on 13 December and because the Geminianus in question, mentioned in the Passio of Saint Lucy, seems to be a fictitious figure, unrelated to the Geminianus whose feast is on 31 January.\n\n\n=== Relics ===\n\nSigebert (1030\u20131112), a monk of Gembloux, in his sermo de Sancta Lucia, chronicled that her body lay undisturbed in Sicily for 400 years, before Faroald II, Duke of Spoleto, captured the island and transferred the body to Corfinium in the Abruzzo, Italy. From there it was removed by the Emperor Otho I in 972 to Metz and deposited in the church of St. Vincent. It was from this shrine that an arm of the saint was taken to the monastery of Luitburg in the Diocese of Speyer \u2013 an incident celebrated by Sigebert in verse.The subsequent history of the relics is not clear. According to Umberto Benigni, Stephen II (768) sent the relics of St. Lucy to Constantinople for safety against the Saracen incursions. On their capture of Constantinople in 1204, the French found some relics attributed to Saint Lucy in the city, and Enrico Dandolo, Doge of Venice, secured them for the monastery of St. George at Venice. In 1513 the Venetians presented to Louis XII of France the saint's head, which he deposited in the cathedral church of Bourges. Another account, however, states that the head was brought to Bourges from Rome, where it had been transferred during the time when the relics rested in Corfinium.The remainder of the relics remain in Venice: they were transferred to the church of San Geremia when the church of Santa Lucia was demolished in 1861 to make way for the new railway terminus.  A century later, on 7 November 1981, thieves stole all her bones, except her head.  Police recovered them five weeks later, on her feast day.  Other parts of the corpse have found their way to Rome, Naples, Verona, Lisbon, Milan, as well as Germany, France and Sweden.\n\n\n== Patronage ==\nLucy's Latin name Lucia shares a root (luc-) with the Latin word for light, lux. A number of traditions incorporate symbolic meaning of St. Lucy as the bearer of light in the darkness of winter, her feast day being 13 December. Because some versions of her story relate that her eyes were removed, either by herself or by her persecutors, she is the patron saint of the blind.She is also the patron saint of authors, cutlers, glaziers, laborers, martyrs, peasants, Perugia, Italy; saddlers, salesmen, and stained glass workers. She is invoked against hemorraghes, dysentery, diseases of the eye, and throat infections.St. Lucy is also the patroness of Syracuse in Sicily, Italy. At the Piazza Duomo in Syracuse, the church of Santa Lucia alla Badia houses the painting \"Burial of St. Lucy (Caravaggio)\". She is also the patron saint of the coastal town of Ol\u00f3n, Ecuador, which celebrates with a week-long festival culminating on the feast day 13 December.\nThe Caribbean island of Saint Lucia, one of the Windward Islands in the Lesser Antilles, is named after her.\n\n\n== Iconography ==\n\nThe emblem of eyes on a cup or plate apparently reflects popular devotion to her as protector of sight, because of her name, Lucia (from the Latin word \"lux\" which means \"light\"). In paintings St. Lucy is frequently shown holding her eyes on a golden plate. Lucy was represented in Gothic art holding a dish with two eyes on it. She also holds the palm branch, symbol of martyrdom and victory over evil. Other symbolic images include a lamp, dagger, or two oxen.\n\n\n== In literature ==\n\n\n=== Dante ===\nLucia appears in Dante's Inferno Canto II as the messenger sent to Beatrice from \"The blessed Dame\" (the Virgin Mary), to rouse Beatrice to send Virgil to Dante's aid. Henry Fanshawe Tozer identifies Lucia as representing \"illuminative grace\". According to Robert Pogue Harrison, and Rachel Jacoff, Lucia's appearance in this intermediary role is to reinforce the scene in which Virgil tries to fortify Dante's courage to begin the journey through the Inferno.In the Purgatorio IX:52\u201363, Lucy carries the sleeping Dante to the entrance to Purgatory. Then in Paradiso XXXII Dante places her opposite Adam within the Mystic Rose in Canto XXXII of the Paradiso. Lucy may also be seen as a figure of Illuminating Grace or Mercy or even Justice.\n\n\n=== Donne ===\nHer feast day was commonly described as the shortest day of the year, as it is in John Donne's poem, \"A Nocturnal upon St. Lucie's Day, being the shortest day\" (1627). The poem begins with: \"'Tis the year's midnight, and it is the day's\".Lucia is also the protagonist of a Swedish novel: \"Ett ljus i m\u00f6rkret\" (\"A light in the darkness\") by Agneta Sj\u00f6din.\n\n\n== Popular celebration ==\n\nLucy's feast is on 13 December, in Advent. Her feast once coincided with the Winter Solstice, the shortest day of the year, before calendar reforms, so her feast day has become a festival of light.This is particularly seen in Scandinavian countries, with their long dark winters. There, a young girl dressed in a white dress and a red sash (as the symbol of martyrdom) carries palms and wears a crown or wreath of candles on her head. In Denmark, Norway and Sweden, girls dressed as Lucy carry rolls and cookies in procession as songs are sung. It is said that to vividly celebrate St. Lucy's Day will help one live the long winter days with enough light.A special devotion to St. Lucy is practiced in the Italian regions of Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige, in the North of the country, and Sicily and Calabria, in the South, as well as in Croatian coastal region of Dalmatia. The feast is a Catholic-celebrated holiday with roots that can be traced to Sicily. On 13th of every December it is celebrated with large traditional feasts of home made pasta and various other Italian dishes, with a special dessert of wheat in hot chocolate milk. The large grains of soft wheat are representative of her eyes and are a treat only to be indulged in once a year. In the North of Italy Saint Lucy brings gift to kids between the 12th and\n13 December. Traditionally a bouquet of hay is put outside of the house for Lucy's Donkey and food in the house for Lucy to refresh them after the long night bringing gifts to every kid. In small towns, a parade with Saint Lucy is held the evening of the 12th when she goes through the main streets of the town munching sweets and candy from her cart, always together with her donkey.\nA Hungarian custom is to plant wheat in a small pot on St. Lucy's feast. By Christmas green sprouts appear, signs of life coming from death. The wheat is then carried to the manger scene as the symbol of Christ in the Eucharist.\nIn the Philippines, villagers from Barangay Sta. Lucia in Magarao, Camarines Sur, hold a novena to St. Lucy nine days before her feast. A procession of the saint's image is held every morning at the poblacion or village centre during the nine days leading up to St. Lucy's Day, attracting devotees from other parts of the Bicol Region. Hymns to the saint, known as the Gozos, as well as the Spanish version of the Ave Maria are chanted during the dawn procession, which is followed by a Mass.\nThe feast day is also commemorated in Barangay Sucad inApalit Pampanga after the traditional nine-day novena, where a whole day celebration is observed through Eucharistic masses, festivals and the procession of the religious sculpture of Sta. Lucia in the evening before the evening mass.\n\n\n== List of dedications to Saint Lucy ==\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n{{columns list|colwidth=30em|\n\nSaint Lucia's Church, Upton Magna, Shropshire, England\nChiesa di Santa Lucia, Belpasso, Catania, Sicily, Italy\nSaint Lucy's chapel, cathedral, Syracuse, Sicily, Italy\nSaint Lucy's Church, Methuen, Massachusetts, United States\nChurch of Saint Lucia (Iglesia de Santa Luc\u00eda), M\u00e9rida, Mexico\nSt. Lucia Church, Puthoor, India\nSt. Lucia Church, Erayumanthurai, India\nSt. Lucia's Cathedral, Kotahena, Sri Lanka\nChurch of San Geremia and the grave of Saint Lucy, Venice, Italy\nChurch of St. Lucia at the Tomb (Church of St. Lucia Outside the Walls), Syracuse, Sicily, Italy\nChiesa di Santa Lucia alla Badia, also Syracuse, Sicily, Italy\nSt. Lucy Catholic Church, Highland Beach, Florida, United States\n\u00c9glise Sainte-Lucie de Valli\u00e8res, Metz, Moselle, France\nSt. Lucy's National Shrine at Micoud, Saint Lucia\nSt. Lucy, Virgin and Martyr Parish, Capalonga, Camarines Norte, Philippines\nSta.

        "wiki": "Nancy ( NAN-see, also UK: , US: , French: [n\u0251\u0303si]; German: Nanzig [\u02c8nantsi\u00e7]) is the capital of the north-eastern French department of Meurthe-et-Moselle, and formerly the capital of the Duchy of Lorraine, and then the French province of the same name. The metropolitan area of Nancy had a population of 434,565 inhabitants at the 2011 census, making it the 20th largest urban area in France. The population of the city of Nancy proper was 104,321 in 2014.The motto of the city is Non inultus premor, Latin for '\"I am not injured unavenged\"'\u2014a reference to the thistle, which is a symbol of Lorraine.\nPlace Stanislas, a large square built between March 1752 and November 1755 by Stanislaus I of Poland to link the medieval old town of Nancy and the new town built under Charles III in the 17th century, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the first place in France and in the top four in the world.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest signs of human settlement in the area date to 800 BC. Early settlers were likely attracted by easily mined iron ore and a ford in the Meurthe River. Its name is first attested as Nanciaco, possibly from a Gaulish personal name. A small fortified town named Nanciacum (Nancy) was built by G\u00e9rard, Duke of Lorraine around 1050.\nNancy was burned in 1218 at the end of the War of Succession of Champagne, and conquered by Emperor Frederick II. It was rebuilt in stone over the next few centuries as it grew in importance as the capital of the Duchy of Lorraine. Duke Charles the Bold of Burgundy, was defeated and killed in the Battle of Nancy in 1477; Ren\u00e9 II, Duke of Lorraine became the ruler.\nFollowing the failure of both Emperor Joseph I and Emperor Charles VI to produce a son and heir, the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 left the throne to the latter's next child. This turned out to be a daughter, Maria Theresa of Austria. In 1736, Emperor Charles arranged her marriage to Duke Fran\u00e7ois of Lorraine, who reluctantly agreed to exchange his ancestral lands for the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. \nThe exiled Polish king Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski, father-in-law of the French king Louis XV, was then given the vacant duchy of Lorraine. Under his nominal rule, Nancy experienced growth and a flowering of Baroque culture and architecture. Stanislaus oversaw the construction of Place Stanislaus, a major square and development connecting the old medieval with a newer part of the city. Upon Stanis\u0142aw's death in February 1766, Lorraine and Barrois became a regular government of the Kingdom of France. A parlement for Lorraine and Barrois was established in Nancy in 1776.As unrest surfaced within the French armed forces during the French Revolution, a full-scale mutiny, known as the Nancy affair, took place in Nancy in the latter part of summer 1790. A few units loyal to the government laid siege to the town and shot or imprisoned the mutineers.\nIn 1871, Nancy remained French when Prussia annexed Alsace-Lorraine. The flow of refugees reaching Nancy doubled its population in three decades. Artistic, academic, financial and industrial excellence flourished, establishing what is still the Capital of Lorraine's trademark to this day.\nNancy and other areas of France were occupied by German forces from 1940, renamed Nanzig. During the Lorraine Campaign of World War II, Nancy was liberated from Nazi Germany by the U.S. Third Army in September 1944, at the Battle of Nancy.\nIn 1988, Pope John Paul II visited Nancy. In 2005, French President Jacques Chirac, German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, and Polish President Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski inaugurated the renovated Place Stanislas. It is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. \n\n\n== Geography ==\nNancy is situated on the left bank of the river Meurthe, about 10 km upstream from its confluence with the Moselle. The Marne\u2013Rhine Canal runs through the city, parallel to the Meurthe. Nancy is surrounded by hills that are about 150 m higher than the city center, which is situated at 200 m above mean sea level. The area of Nancy proper is relatively small: 15 km2. Its built-up area is continuous with those of its adjacent suburbs. The neighboring communes of Nancy are: Jarville-la-Malgrange, Laxou, Malz\u00e9ville, Max\u00e9ville, Saint-Max, Tomblaine, Vand\u0153uvre-l\u00e8s-Nancy and Villers-l\u00e8s-Nancy.\nThe oldest part of Nancy is the quarter Vieille Ville \u2013 L\u00e9opold, which contains the 14th century Porte de la Craffe, the Palace of the Dukes of Lorraine, the Porte D\u00e9silles and the 19th century St-Epvre basilica. Adjacent to its south is the quarter Charles III \u2013 Centre Ville, which is the 16th\u201318th century \"new town\". This quarter contains the famous Place Stanislas, the Nancy Cathedral, the Op\u00e9ra national de Lorraine and the main railway station.\nThe population of the city proper experienced a small decrease in population from 2009 to 2014, placing it behind Metz (117,619) as the second largest city in the Lorraine. However, the urban area of Metz experienced population decline from 1990 to 2010 while the urban area of Nancy grew over the same period, becoming the largest urban area in Lorraine and second largest in the \"Grand Est\" region of northeastern France. Within the Nancy metropolitan area in recent years, the city population declined slightly (2009\u20132014) at the roughly same time as a small increase in the population of its urban area (2006\u20132012).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nNancy has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), although a bit more extreme than most of the larger French cities. By the standards of France it is a \"continental\" climate with a certain degree of maritimy (unrelated to the K\u00f6ppen classification, since generally the whole country has a predominant mechanism favored by the West winds).The temperatures have a distinct variation of the temperate zone, both during the day and between seasons but without being very different. Winters are cold and dry in freezing climates. Summers are not always sunny, but warm enough. Mists are frequent in autumn and the winds are light and not too violent. Precipitation tends to be less abundant than in the west of the country. Sunshine hours are almost identical to Paris and the snowy days are the same as Strasbourg (most similar weather conditions). Although the lowest recorded temperature is officially \u221226.8 \u00b0C, some sources consider temperatures from \u221230 \u00b0C on 10 December 1879 before continuous data.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n \n\nThe old city center's heritage dates from the Middle Ages to the 18th century. The cathedral of Nancy, the Triumphal Arch and the \"Place de la Carriere\" are a fine examples of 18th-century architecture. The Palace of the Dukes of Lorraine is the former princely residence of the rulers. The palace houses the Mus\u00e9e Lorrain.\nA historic church is the Church of Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours, Nancy, final resting place of the last duke Stanislas. Other notable churches are the Church of Saint-Fran\u00e7ois-des-Cordeliers and the Basilica of Saint-Epvre (fr:Basilique Saint-Epvre de Nancy), which have historical ties to the ducal House of Lorraine.\nThe Place Stanislas named after king of Poland and duke of Lorraine Stanislaus I, Place de la Carri\u00e8re, and Place d'Alliance were added on the World Heritage Sites list by the UNESCO in 1983.\nThe \"\u00c9cole de Nancy\", a group of artists and architects founded by the glassmaster and furniture maker \u00c9mile Gall\u00e9, worked in the art nouveau style at the end of the 19th century and the early 20th century. It was principally their work which made Nancy a center of art and architecture that rivaled Paris and helped give the city the nickname \"Capitale de l'Est\". The city still possesses many Art Nouveau buildings (mostly banks or private homes). Furniture, glassware, and other pieces of the decorative arts are conserved at the Mus\u00e9e de l'\u00c9cole de Nancy, which is housed in the 1909 villa of Eug\u00e8ne Corbin, a Nancy businessman and supporter of the Art Nouveau there. The Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts has further collections of the art nouveau movement.\nA major botanical garden, the Jardin botanique du Montet, is located at Villers-l\u00e8s-Nancy. Other gardens of interest include the city's earliest botanical garden, the Jardin Dominique Alexandre Godron, and various other public gardens and places of interest including the P\u00e9pini\u00e8re and Parc Sainte-Marie (public gardens).

The motorway A31 connects Nancy with Metz, Luxembourg and Langres.\nPublic transport within Nancy is provided by Service de Transport de l'Agglom\u00e9ration Nanc\u00e9ienne (STAN), operated by Veolia Transport, operating the Tram by STAN and around 20 conventional bus routes.\nThe most heavily used route, the Tram T1, is a so-called 'tramway on tires', which is actually a guided busway based on Bombardier Transportation's Guided Light Transit (GLT) technology and using articulated trolleybuses. In addition to diesel buses, Nancy has been served by trolleybuses since 1982, but in 2000 the three-route trolleybus system was reconfigured into a single, longer route and with a surface guidance system added (GLT, or TVR in French). The guidance systems covers about two-thirds of the approximately 10-km route, and the trolleybuses are separated from other traffic over that portion of the route, speeding travel times. During its first two years, the new system suffered many incidents and malfunctions of the guidance system, but now works without significant problems.\n\n\n== Heraldry ==\n\nThe coat of arms of Nancy displays a thistle, originally considered to be a symbol of Virgin Mary, and adopted as a personal symbol by Ren\u00e9 of Anjou and later by his descendant Ren\u00e9 II, Duke of Lorraine. Contrary to the Scottish thistle, the one of Lorraine is always shown with its roots. During the wars against Burgundy, the thistle became an emblem for the people of Lorraine as a whole. It officially became the attribute of the city of Nancy in 1575 when Charles III, Duke of Lorraine granted the city with its own coat of arms.At first, the coat of arms of Nancy had a chief of Lorraine, which meant that the upper part showed the ducal arms, namely three alerions on a red bend. Later, the chief of Lorraine was replaced by a more complex one which gathers the former possessions of the Dukes of Lorraine. The upper row comprises from left to right the arms of the Kingdom of Hungary, the Kingdom of Naples, the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Kingdom of Aragon, while the lower row comprises the Duchy of Anjou, the Duchy of Guelders, the Duchy of J\u00fclich and the County of Bar. The inescutcheon is the coat of arms of Lorraine itself.The coat of arms displays the motto, which appeared in the end of the 16th century. It was initially \"Nul ne s'y frotte\" (\"no one attacks it\"), but it was changed to Latin \"Non inultus premor\" in 1616. The motto has a similar meaning to the Scottish one, \"Nemo me impune lacessit\", usually translated as \"No one attacks me with impunity\", which also makes reference to the thistle. The coat of arms further displays the Legion of Honour, awarded to the city after the First World War, and the War Crosses 14\u201318 and 39\u201345.\n\n\n== See also ==\nN ray, a figment of local physicist Ren\u00e9-Prosper Blondlot's imagination, named for Nancy.\nParc naturel r\u00e9gional de Lorraine\nThe great organ of Nancy Cathedral\nList of twin towns and sister cities in France\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nThe Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.

        "wiki": "Metz ( METS, French: [m\u025bs] (listen), Lorraine Franconian: [m\u025bts]) Latin: Divodurum Mediomatricorum is a city in northeast France located at the confluence of the Moselle and the Seille rivers. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle department and the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region. Located near the tripoint along the junction of France, Germany, and Luxembourg, the city forms a central place of the European Greater Region and the SaarLorLux euroregion.Metz has a rich 3,000-year-history, having variously been a Celtic oppidum, an important Gallo-Roman city, the Merovingian capital of Austrasia, the birthplace of the Carolingian dynasty, a cradle of the Gregorian chant, and one of the oldest republics in Europe. The city has been steeped in Romance culture, but has been strongly influenced by Germanic culture due to its location and history.Because of its historical, cultural, and architectural background, Metz has been submitted on France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. The city features noteworthy buildings such as the Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral with its largest expanse of stained-glass windows in the world, the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains being the oldest church in France, its Imperial Station Palace displaying the apartment of the German Kaiser, or its Opera House, the oldest one working in France. Metz is home to some world-class venues including the Arsenal Concert Hall and the Centre Pompidou-Metz museum.\nA basin of urban ecology, Metz gained its nickname of The Green City (French: La Ville Verte), as it has extensive open grounds and public gardens. The historic city centre is one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France.A historic garrison town, Metz is the economic heart of the Lorraine region, specialising in information technology and automotive industries. Metz is home to the University of Lorraine, Georgia Tech Lorraine, and a centre for applied research and development in the materials sector, notably in metallurgy and metallography, the heritage of the Lorraine region's past in the iron and steel industry.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn ancient times, the town was known as \"city of Mediomatrici\", being inhabited by the tribe of the same name. After its integration into the Roman Empire, the city was called Divodurum Mediomatricum, meaning Holy Village or Holy Fortress of the Mediomatrici, then it was known as Mediomatrix. During the 5th century AD, the name evolved to \"Mettis\", which gave rise to Metz.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMetz has a recorded history dating back over 2,000 years. Before the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar in 52 BC, it was the oppidum of the Celtic Mediomatrici tribe. Integrated into the Roman Empire, Metz became quickly one of the principal towns of Gaul with a population of 40,000, until the barbarian depredations and its transfer to the Franks about the end of the 5th century. Between the 6th and 8th centuries, the city was the residence of the Merovingian kings of Austrasia. After the Treaty of Verdun in 843, Metz became the capital of the Kingdom of Lotharingia and was ultimately integrated into the Holy Roman Empire, being granted semi-independent status. During the 12th century, Metz became a republic and the Republic of Metz stood until the 15th century.With the signature of the Treaty of Chambord in 1552, Metz passed to the hands of the Kings of France. As the German Protestant Princes who traded Metz (alongside Toul and Verdun) for the promise of French military assistance, had no authority to cede territory of the Holy Roman Empire, the change of jurisdiction wasn't recognised by the Holy Roman Empire until the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. Under French rule, Metz was selected as capital of the Three Bishoprics and became a strategic fortified town. With creation of the departments by the Estates-General of 1789, Metz was chosen as capital of the Department of Moselle. Although French-speaking, after the Franco-Prussian War and according to the Treaty of Frankfurt of 1871, the city was annexed into the German Empire, being part of the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine and serving as capital of the Bezirk Lothringen.Metz remained German until the end of World War I, when it reverted to France. However, after the Battle of France during the Second World War, the city was annexed once more by the German Third Reich. In 1944, the attack on the city by the U.S. Third Army freed the city from German rule and Metz reverted one more time to France after World War II.During the 1950s, Metz was chosen to be the capital of the newly created Lorraine region. With the creation of the European Community and the later European Union, the city has become central to the Greater Region and the SaarLorLux Euroregion.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMetz is located on the banks of the Moselle and the Seille rivers, 43 km (26.7 mi) from the Schengen tripoint where the borders of France, Germany, and Luxembourg meet. The city was built in a place where many branches of the Moselle river creates several islands, which are encompassed within the urban planning.The terrain of Metz forms part of the Paris Basin and presents a plateau relief cut by river valleys presenting cuestas in the north\u2013south direction. Metz and its surrounding countryside are included in the forest and crop Lorraine Regional Natural Park, covering a total area of 205,000 ha (506,566.0 acres).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of Lorraine is a semi-continental climate. The summers are warm and humid, sometimes stormy, and the warmest month of the year is July, when daytime temperatures average approximately 25 \u00b0C (77.0 \u00b0F). The winters are cold and snowy with temperature dropping to an average low of \u22120.5 \u00b0C (31.1 \u00b0F) in January. Lows can be much colder through the night and early morning and the snowy period extends from November to February.The length of the day varies significantly over the course of the year. The shortest day is 21 December with 7:30 hours of sunlight; the longest day is 20 June with 16:30 hours of sunlight. The median cloud cover is 93% and does not vary substantially over the course of the year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nThe inhabitants of Metz are called Messin(e)s. Statistics on the ethnic and religious make up of the population of Metz are haphazard, as the French Republic prohibits making distinctions between citizens regarding race, beliefs, and political and philosophic opinions in the process of census taking. This would otherwise document the city to be a Germanic locale, as is the rest of the province and the neighboring Alsace.The French national census of 2012 estimated the population of Metz to be 119,551, while the population of Metz urban agglomeration was about 389,851. Through history, Metz's population has been impacted by the vicissitudes of the wars and annexations involving the city, which have prevented continuous population growth. More recently, the city has suffered from the restructuring of the military and the metallurgy industry. The historical population for the current area of Metz municipality is as follows:\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\nSeveral well-known figures have been linked to the city of Metz throughout its history. Renowned Messins include poet Paul Verlaine, composer Ambroise Thomas, and mathematician Jean-Victor Poncelet; numerous well-known German figures were also born in Metz notably during the annexation periods. Moreover, the city has been the residence of people such as writer Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Cardinal Mazarin, political thinker Alexis de Tocqueville, French patriot and American Revolutionary War hero Marquis Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette, and Luxembourg-born German-French statesman Robert Schuman.\n\n\n== Law and government ==\n\n\n=== Local law ===\n\nThe Local Law (French: droit local) applied in Metz is a legal system that operates in parallel with French law. Created in 1919, it preserves the French laws applied in France before 1870 and maintained by the Germans during the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, but repealed in the rest of France after 1871. It also maintains German laws enacted by the German Empire between 1871 and 1918, specific provisions adopted by the local authorities, and French laws that have been enacted after 1919 to be applicable only in Alsace-Lorraine. This specific local legislation encompasses different areas including religion, social work and finance.\nThe most striking of the legal differences between France and Alsace-Lorraine is the absence in Alsace-Lorraine of strict secularism, even though a constitutional right of freedom of religion is guaranteed by the French government. Alsace-Lorraine is still governed by a pre-1905 law established by the Concordat of 1801, which provides for the public subsidy of the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches and the Jewish religion.\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\nLike every commune of the present French Republic, Metz is managed by a mayor (French: maire) and a municipal council (French: conseil municipal), democratically elected by two-round proportional voting for six years. The mayor is assisted by 54 municipal councillors, and the municipal council is held on the last Thursday of every month. Since 2008, the mayor of Metz has been socialist Dominique Gros.The city belongs to the Metz Metropole union of cities, which includes the 40 cities of the Metz urban agglomeration. Metz is the prefecture of the Moselle based in the former Intendant Palace. In addition, Metz is the seat of the parliament of the Grand Est region, hosted in the former Saint-Clement Abbey.\n\n\n=== City administrative divisions ===\n\nThe city of Metz is divided into 14 administrative divisions:\n\n\n== Cityscape and environmental policy ==\n\nMetz contains a mishmash of architectural layers, bearing witness to centuries of history at the crossroads of different cultures, and features a number of architectural landmarks. The city possesses one of the largest Urban Conservation Areas in France, and more than 100 of the city's buildings are classified on the Monument Historique list. Because of its historical and cultural background, Metz is designated as French Town of Art and History, and has been submitted on to France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List.The city is famous for its yellow limestone architecture, a result of the extensive use of Jaumont stone. The historic district has kept part of the Gallo-Roman city with Divodurum's Cardo Maximus, then called Via Scarponensis (today the Trinitaires, Taison, and Serpenoise streets), and the Decumanus Maximus (today En Fournirue and d'Estr\u00e9es streets). At the Cardo and Decumanus intersection was situated the Roman forum, today the Saint-Jacques Square.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nFrom its Gallo-Roman past, the city preserves vestiges of the thermae (in the basement of the Golden Courtyard museum), parts of the aqueduct, and the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains.Saint Louis' square with its vaulted arcades and a Knights Templar chapel remains a major symbol of the city's High Medieval heritage. The Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral, several churches and H\u00f4tels, and two remarkable municipal granaries reflect the Late Middle Ages. Examples of Renaissance architecture can be seen in H\u00f4tels from the 16th century, such as the House of Heads (French: Maison des T\u00eates).The city hall and the buildings surrounding the town square are by French architect Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Blondel, who was awarded the task of redesigning and modernizing the centre of Metz by the Royal Academy of Architecture in 1755 the context of the Enlightenment. Neoclassical buildings from the 18th century, such as the Opera House, the Intendant Palace (the present-day prefecture), and the Royal Governor's Palace (the present-day courthouse) built by Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau, are also found in the city.The Imperial District was built during the first annexation of Metz by the German Empire. In order to \"germanise\" the city, Emperor Wilhelm II decided to create a new district shaped by a distinctive blend of Germanic architecture, including Renaissance, neo-Romanesque and neo-Classical, mixed with elements of Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Alsatian and mock-Bavarian styles. Instead of Jaumont stone, commonly used everywhere else in the city, stone used in the Rhineland, such as pink and grey sandstone, granite and basalt were used. The district features noteworthy buildings including the rail station and the Central Post Office by German architect J\u00fcrgen Kr\u00f6ger.Modern architecture can also be seen in the town with works of French architects Roger-Henri Expert (Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-de-l'Enfant-J\u00e9sus church, 1934), Georges-Henri Pingusson (Fire Station, 1960), and Jean Dubuisson (subdivisions, 1960s). The refurbishment of the former Ney Arsenal as a Concert Hall in 1989 and the erection of the Metz Arena in 2002, by Spanish and French architects Ricardo Bofill and French Paul Chemetov represent the Postmodern movement.The Centre Pompidou-Metz museum in the Amphitheatre District represents a strong architectural initiative to mark the entrance of Metz into the 21st century. Designed by Japanese architect Shigeru Ban, the building is remarkable for the complex, innovative carpentry of its roof, and integrates concepts of sustainable architecture. The project encompasses the architecture of two recipients of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, Shigeru Ban (2014) and French Christian de Portzamparc (1994). The Amphitheatre District is also conceived by French architects Nicolas Michelin, Jean-Paul Viguier, and Jean-Michel Wilmotte and designer Philippe Starck. The urban project is expected to be completed by 2023. Further, a contemporary music venue designed by contextualist French architect Rudy Ricciotti stands in the Borny District.\n\n\n=== Urban ecology ===\n\nUnder the leadership of such people as botanist Jean-Marie Pelt, Metz pioneered a policy of urban ecology during the early 1970s. Because of the failure of post-war urban planning and housing estate development in Europe during the 1960s, mostly based on the concepts of CIAM, Jean-Marie Pelt, then municipal councillor of Metz, initiated a new approach to the urban environment.Based initially on the ideas of the Chicago School, Pelt's theories pleaded for better integration of humans into their environment and developed a concept centered on the relationship between \"stone and water\". His policy was realized in Metz by the establishment of extensive open areas surrounding the Moselle and the Seille rivers and the development of large pedestrian areas. As a result, Metz has over 37 m2 (400 sq ft) of open areas per inhabitant in the form of numerous public gardens in the city.The principles of urban ecology are still applied in Metz with the implementation of a local Agenda 21 action plan. The municipal ecological policy encompasses the sustainable refurbishment of ancient buildings, the erection of sustainable districts and buildings, green public transport, and the creation of public gardens by means of landscape architecture.Additionally, the city has developed its own combined heat and power station, using waste wood biomass from the surrounding forests as a renewable energy source. With a thermal efficiency above 80%, the 45MW boiler of the plant provides electricity and heat for 44,000 dwellings. The Metz power station is the first local producer and distributor of energy in France.\n\n\n=== Military architecture ===\n\nAs a historic Garrison town, Metz has been heavily influenced by military architecture throughout its history. From ancient history to the present, the city has been successively fortified and modified to accommodate the troops stationed there. Defensive walls from classical antiquity to the 20th century are still visible today, incorporated into the design of public gardens along the Moselle and Seille rivers. A medieval bridge castle from the 13th century, named Germans' Gate (French: Porte des Allemands), today converted into a convention and exhibition centre, has become one of the landmarks of the city. It is still possible to see parts of the 16th century citadel, as well as fortifications built in the 1740s by Louis de Cormontaigne but based on designs by Vauban. Important barracks, mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries, are spread around the city: some, which are of architectural interest, have been converted to civilian use, such as the Arsenal Concert Hall by Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill.\nThe extensive fortifications of Metz, which ring the city, include early examples of S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res system forts. Other forts were incorporated into the Maginot Line. A hiking trail on the Saint-Quentin plateau passes through a former military training zone and ends at the now abandoned military forts, providing a vantage point from which to survey the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAlthough the steel industry has historically dominated Moselle's economy, Metz's efforts at economic diversification have created a base in the sectors of commerce, tourism, information technology and the automotive industry. The city is the economic heart of the Lorraine region and around 73,000 people work daily within the urban agglomeration. The transport facilities found in the conurbation, including the international high-speed railway, motorway, inland connections and the local bus rapid transit system, have made the city a transport hub in the heart of the European Union. Metz is home to the biggest harbour handling cereals in France with over 4,000,000 tons/year.Metz is home to the Moselle Chamber of Commerce. International companies such as PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, ArcelorMittal, SFR, and TDF have established plants and centres in the Metz conurbation. Metz is also the regional headquarters of the Caisse d'Epargne and Banque Populaire banking groups.\nMetz is an important commercial centre of northern France with France's biggest retailer federation, consisting of around 2,000 retailers. Important retail companies are found in the city, such as the Galeries Lafayette, the Printemps department store and the Fnac entertainment retail chain. The historic city centre displays one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France and a mall, the Saint-Jacques centre. In addition there are several multiplex movie theatres and malls found in the urban agglomeration.\nIn recent years, Metz municipality have promoted an ambitious policy of tourism development, including urban revitalization and refurbishment of buildings and public squares. This policy has been spurred by the creation of the Centre Pompidou-Metz in 2010. Since its inauguration, the institution has become the most popular cultural venue in France outside Paris, with 550,000 visitors per year. Meanwhile, Saint-Stephen Cathedral is the most visited building in the city, accommodating 652,000 visitors per year.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums and exhibition halls ===\n\nThe Centre Pompidou-Metz is a museum of modern and contemporary arts, the largest temporary exhibition area in France outside Paris. The museum features exhibitions from the extensive collection of the Centre Pompidou, Europe's largest collection of 20th-century art.\nSaint Stephen's Cathedral is the Gothic cathedral of the city built during the 13th century. The cathedral exhibits the collection of the Bishopric of Metz, including paraments and items used in the service of the Eucharist. Metz Cathedral is sometimes nicknamed the Good Lord's Lantern (French: la Lanterne du Bon Dieu), as it has the largest expanse of stained glass windows in the world: 6,500 m2 (70,000 sq ft). These include works by Gothic and Renaissance master glass makers Hermann von M\u00fcnster, Th\u00e9obald of Lixheim, and Valentin Bousch, romantic Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal, tachist Roger Bissi\u00e8re, cubist Jacques Villon and modernist Marc Chagall.\nAnother of the city's churches displays a complete set of stained glass windows by French modernist Jean Cocteau.In addition, Metz features other museums and exhibition venues, such as:\n\nThe FRAC Lorraine, a public collection of contemporary art of the Lorraine region. It is located in the 12th-century Saint-Liver H\u00f4tel and organizes exhibitions of local and international contemporary artists.\nThe Golden Courtyard (French: la Cour d'Or), a museum dedicated to the history of Metz, divided into four sections (e.g. archeology, medieval, architecture, and fine arts). The Golden Courtyard displays a rich collection of Gallo-Roman and medieval finds and the remains of the Gallo-Roman baths of Divodurum Mediomatricum, revealed by the extension works to the museums in the 1930s.\nThe Museum of the 1870 War and of the Annexion in Gravelotte, a village located within the Metz-Metropole conurbation and the site of the Battle of Gravelotte, the only museum in Europe dedicated to the Franco-Prussian War. The museum exhibits military and everyday items from the period as well as artworks related to the 1870 war. A mausoleum erected in 1904 honoring the soldiers who died during the battle, the Memorial Hall (French: La Halle du Souvenir), has been included in the museum.\nThe House for Europe, located on the estate of Robert Schuman in Scy-Chazelles in the Metz-Metropole conurbation, transformed into a museum and convention centre. Across the street is the fortified 12th Century church where Robert Schuman now rests. The Robert Schuman House for Europe organises cultural and educational events that introduce the visitor to Schuman's life and works and to the way Europe has been constructed and continues to develop today.\nVerlaine's House (French: la Maison de Verlaine) is a museum located in the house where the poet Paul Verlaine was born, dedicated to his work, featuring permanent and temporary exhibitions. The Solange Bertrand foundation, located in the artist's former house, conserves and displays her artworks. The municipal archives preserve and exhibit Metz's historical municipal records dating from medieval times to the present.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\nMetz has several venues for the performing arts. The Opera House of Metz, the oldest working opera house in France, features plays, dance, and lyric poetry. The Arsenal Concert Hall, dedicated to art music, is widely renowned for its excellent acoustics. The Trinitarians Club is a multi-media arts complex housed in the vaulted cellar and chapel of an ancient convent, the city's prime venue for jazz music. The Music Box (French: Boite \u00e0 Musique), familiarly known as BAM, is the concert venue dedicated to rock and electronic music. The Braun Hall and the Kolt\u00e8s Theater feature plays, and the city has two movie theaters specializing in Auteur cinema. The Saint-Jacques Square, surrounded by busy bars and pubs whose open-air tables fill the centre of the square.\nSince 2014, the former bus garage has been converted to accommodate over thirty artists in residence, in a space where they can create and rehearse artworks and even build set decorations. The artistic complex, called Metz Network of All Cultures (French: Toutes les Cultures en R\u00e9seau \u00e0 Metz) and familiarly known as TCRM-Blida, encompasses a large hall of 3,000 m2 (32,000 sq ft) while theater and dance companies benefit from a studio of 800 m2 (8,600 sq ft) with backstages.\n\n\n=== Metz in the arts ===\nMetz was an important cultural centre during the Carolingian Renaissance. For instance, Gregorian chant was created in Metz during the 8th century as a fusion of Gallican and ancient Roman repertory. Then called Messin Chant, it remains the oldest form of music still in use in Western Europe. The bishops of Metz, notably Saint-Chrodegang promoted its use for the Roman liturgy in Gallic lands under the favorable influence of the Carolingian monarchs. Messin chant made two major contributions to the body of chant: it fitted the chant into the ancient Greek octoechos system, and invented an innovative musical notation, using neumes to show the shape of a remembered melody. Metz was also an important centre of illumination of Carolingian manuscripts, producing such monuments of Carolingian book illumination as the Drogo Sacramentary.The Metz School (French: \u00c9cole de Metz) was an art movement in Metz and the region between 1834 and 1870, centred on Charles-Laurent Mar\u00e9chal. The term was originally proposed in 1845 by the poet Charles Baudelaire, who appreciated the works of the artists. They were influenced by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix and inspired by the medieval heritage of Metz and its romantic surroundings. The Franco-Prussian War and the annexation of the territory by the Germans resulted in the dismantling of the movement.

Numerous shows are presented to it.\n\n\n=== The Graoully dragon as symbol of the city ===\n\nThe Graoully is depicted as a fearsome dragon, vanquished by the sacred powers of Saint Clement of Metz, the first Bishop of the city. The Graoully quickly became a symbol of Metz and can be seen in numerous insignia of the city, from the 10th century on. Writers from Metz tend to present the legend as an allegory of Christianity's victory over paganism, represented by the harmful dragon.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nLocal specialties include the quiche, the pot\u00e9e, the Lorrain p\u00e2t\u00e9, and also suckling pig.

Also, Metz is the cradle of some pastries like the Metz cheese pie and the Metz Balls (French: boulet de Metz), a ganache-stuffed biscuit coated with marzipan, caramel, and dark chocolate. Local beverages include Moselle wine and Amos beer.The Covered Market of Metz is one of the oldest, most grandiose in France and is home to traditional local food producers and retailers. Originally built as the bishop's palace, the French Revolution broke out before the Bishop of Metz could move in and the citizens decided to turn it into a food market. The adjacent Chamber's Square (French: Place de la Chambre) is surrounded by numerous local food restaurants.\n\n\n=== Celebrations and events ===\nMany events are celebrated in Metz throughout the year. The city of Metz dedicates two weeks to the Mirabelle plum during the popular Mirabelle Festival held in August.
